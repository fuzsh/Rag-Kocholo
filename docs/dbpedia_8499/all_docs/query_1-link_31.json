        "text": "CroDiag, Isles May 28 , 2012 Mon 11 : 17 PM local\n\nAlmost 15-20 days ago I did another email interview with Farhana from Filmfare. It has still not been published, or if it has, I am unaware of it since I travel the seas. I am reproducing it, because it is too long a wait for the publishers to decide when the interview shall get printed, if at all it does ; there are other bigger stars and issues that deserve pride of place I guess in their magazine. They may find my interview insignificant, but it is of extreme significance for my Ef and so here it is -\n\n1. In recent times you’ve worked the most with Ram Gopal Varma, the latest being in Department. What’s it about RGV that appeals to you despite his infamous irreverence?\n\nANS // Ram Gopal Varma, much to the consternation of many, is an intelligent mind, an independent thought process to life and his profession, and one having the great ability to spot the right talent for the right job at the right time. What appeals to me most about him is the absence of any of these qualities in my being. Infamous is a most harsh expression for one that harnesses such intrinsic worth. And ‘irreverence’ on Google definition search, stated ‘ no results found’. If Google can’t find it neither can I !!\n\n2. For your character of a reformed gangster-turned-politician, Sarjerao Gaikwad, you have reportedly modulated your baritone. Kindly elaborate.\n\nANS // No .. I have done no such act ! On the first day of the shoot I had a bad cold, and what you hear in the promotional teasers is what the vocals decided to project at that moment. Ramu liked it and it stayed. And incidentally, the much spoken baritone that you and many others draw attention to, is not such a great asset. There are several other more prominent and proficient baritones that inhabit our Industry. Om Puri and Raza Murad come to mind instantly !!\n\n3. Was politician Lalu Prasad Yadav the reference for the look?\n\nANS // No not at all ! That was incorrect media speculation. Either you have not given much attention to the promo, or you haven’t seen enough of Lalu Prasad Yadav !\n\n4. What is it about politics that was totally incongruent with your personality?\n\nANS // Politics was and is something that I am not qualified for. I do not know it. For me it has been a qualified failure, which I most humbly accept !\n\n5. What excites you about hosting Kaun Banega Crorepati 6 – is it the same adrenalin rush?\n\nANS // Any work of creation and creativity, must essentially have some kind of rush to be involved in it. I have never practically seen ‘adrenalin’, but if that is the expression being used to describe my interest in KBC, then yes I stand behind it. KBC in all its years of existence and manifestations has given me the equivalent pleasure that one gets of welcoming a house guest. The contestants make the show. I merely go by the strong belief, that ‘given an opportunity’ even the so called weaker sections of our society can come across with flying colours. And one does not have to justify this through example. All those that tune in to the show, witness it, each broadcast day.\n\n6. You sang Rabindranath Tagore’s iconic song Ekla chalo re for Sujoy Ghosh’s Kahaani and praised its poetry and music. Do you agree it’s eventually a lone journey for each one of us?\n\nANS // Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s poetry and music are works of an exemplary genius. Reading, understanding and listening to their renditions fills one with awe and unending respect. Being obliquely connected to them, is sufficient reason to have been blessed by his aura. Gurudev does not, I think, propagate a lone journey for each one of us in ‘Ekla chalo re’. He rather expresses that if the ‘others’ do not listen to your call, then must you walk alone. Personally though, I would believe that we all walk alone, despite the accoutrements that one gathers through the years of our existence. I discovered this very early in my life, when throughout my school days I entered the boxing ring. Within the four cornered ropes of the ‘ring’, it was just your opponent and you that mattered. There were hundreds that cheered and screamed and encouraged from outside, but inside the four corners you were fighting alone. It was one of the most practical lessons that life taught me !!\n\n7. Recently, Oprah Winfrey paid you and India a visit. What do you find inspirational about her?\n\nANS// …. to have fought individually and alone against the most adverse circumstances that she had to face, without giving up !!\n\n8. What impression did working for Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby leave you with?\n\nANS // Baz Luhrmann has been a visionary. A director of immense aesthetics, and one who has dared to present his interpretation of cinema in a most unique style. Working with him, albeit in just a small minute role in ‘Gatsby’, was educative and a lasting, memorable experience. His attention to detail even in the most seemingly insignificant aspects of the film, is beyond description. I had never before worked in a set up so professional and exact.\n\n9. Are you for remakes, more so because the recent Don and Agneepath were your landmark movies?\n\nANS// Remakes are the creative prerogatives of those that wish to present an accomplished original, in their own interpretation. If the rights belong to the maker, or through mutually agreed understanding, we cannot challenge their reason and desire. I would expect originals to be left alone, but in a fast changing world, maybe generations that follow would like to be made aware of certain films they may have missed. Having said that, I must admit that generational interest does give credence to the issue. ‘Devdas’ shall always be for me, a film which was immortalised by Dilip Saheb, but the generation before him would admire and connect with K L Saigal’s rendition. Just as today’s generation would always identify ‘Devdas’ with Shahrukh Khan.\n\n10. Your impressions on Hrithik Roshan’s take in Agneepath…\n\nANS // Hrithik is an accomplished artist. His take on ‘Agneepath’ was what was desired by the makers, and in that he delivered well.\n\n11. Recently, you worked with the talented Tabu and Vidya Balan in the acclaimed Cheeni Kum and Paa respectively. What’s most striking about these actors?\n\nANS // They are very good listeners ! If your colleague or co artist does not have the ability to respond well to what you perform, you could be Olivier, Brando, Dilip Kumar and de Niro in one body and still look ordinary. That to me is the greatness of Tabu and Vidya.\n\n12. You were delighted when Dilip Kumar saab praised you on Twitter saying it meant more than any award. Please share your reverence for him.\n\nANS // The space provided in this interview is much too small to be able to express my reverence for Dilip Saheb ! I have been his admirer from the very first time I saw him on screen. He has remained an idol for me and the ultimate in his craft. I have just this to say. When the history of Indian Cinema shall be documented – if it ever is – the annals shall always refer to it as ‘before Dilip Kumar and after Dilip Kumar’ !!\n\n13. What’s the most beautiful memory that you have of working with him in Shakti?\n\nANS // That he is an unselfish artist ! That his penchant for perfection drives him towards a faultless performance, one, never to be replicated ; a timeless gift that shall be left behind for posterity and the generations to come !\n\n14. You are prolific on Twitter and expressive in your blog. How addictive or cathartic have these become for you?\n\nANS // I do not write my Blog or tweet for any catharsis. I do it to be a part of the ‘gang’, to honour connection and response, to build an extended family, a family that lives in expectation of my presence. To be in peace and harmony and to tell those that come and join me that they are not alone !! And yes, at times to have an independent platform for rebuttal !!\n\n15. In between you even quoted your father the late Dr Harivanshrai Bachchan’s verses on Twitter. What is the philosophy that you sieve from his writings?\n\nANS // Do you really think I could elaborate on this here ? 60 years of writing in the life of a litterateur, of poetry and prose, of thesis and thought, of wisdom and worldliness to be encapsulated in FILM fare ? I would consider that an injustice ! Suffice to say that each day I draw from his works his teachings and his guidance as a Father – a most meritorious legacy that shall be eternal in its presence !\n\n16. You’re known to be an avid music lover. What music is your current favourite?\n\nANS // All kinds and shapes and sounds of music are appealing to me. Currently I dwell in the great pleasure of putting music to some of my own compositions and those that were initiated by my Father !!\n\n17. What’s the music you keep returning to again and again?\n\nANS // The one that has the essence of the earth of my birthplace !!\n\n18. At 70, what makes life beautiful?\n\nANS // That I am alive !\n\n19. Is there anything you fear?\n\nANS // Yes .. The fear of inadequacy and the inability to live to expectation.\n\n20. What’s the best thing about having a baby at home?\n\nANS // That even the plants and the trees and the flowers have a smile on their faces when she is around !!\n\n21. What’s the best thing about staying at home when you’ve been advised rest?\n\n22. Are you a sunrise person?\n\nANS // I hate these jingoistic expressions – ‘ I am not a coffee person’, ‘I am not a morning person’ .. They seem to give incorrect adverbial and adjectival relevance to studied and curriculum grammar !! I am capable of getting up early when required and mostly when not required !\n\n23. Where did you witness the best sunset?\n\nThanking you,"
