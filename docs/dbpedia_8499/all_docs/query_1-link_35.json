        "text": "Reconstructing Indian population history.\n\nPubMed\n\nReich, David; Thangaraj, Kumarasamy; Patterson, Nick; Price, Alkes L; Singh, Lalji\n\n2009-09-24\n\nIndia has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the 'Ancestral North Indians' (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the 'Ancestral South Indians' (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.\n\nAmerican Indian Population Statistics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThomason, Timothy C., Ed.\n\nThis report summarizes American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population statistics from the 1990 Census. In 1990 there were about 2 million persons who identified themselves as American Indians in the United States, a 38 percent increase over the 1980 census. More than half of the Indian population lived in six states, with Oklahoma having theâ¦\n\nAorto-iliac occlusive disease in the different population groups--clinical pattern, risk profile and results of reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadiba, T E; Mars, M; Robbs, J V\n\n1999-12-01\n\nIt has previously been accepted that atherosclerotic disease is uncommon among blacks worldwide; however, recent studies have increasingly reported atherosclerotic disease in this group. Prospective study of hospital patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease presenting to the vascular service of the Durban metropolitan hospitals. The study was designed to assess clinical pattern, risk profile and results of reconstruction in these patients. This is a study of 688 patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease managed over 9 years in Durban, with clinical pattern and risk factors compared in the different population groups. A subgroup of 492 patients underwent aortobifemoral bypass, providing material for comparison of the results of reconstruction in the different population groups. More black patients presented with gangrene and threatened limb, whereas whites tended to present early with claudication. All groups had hypertension and diabetes as risk factors. In addition, whites and Indians had ischaemic heart disease, which was not found among blacks. Mortality was 5% (blacks 1.8%, whites 8.5%, Indians 5%). Medium-term occlusion rates were 19% in blacks, 13% in Indians and 5% among whites. Five-year cumulative patency rates were 92% for whites, 77% for Indians and 74% for blacks. Whites do significantly better than blacks, who tend to present at an advanced stage of the disease. The presence of ischaemic heart disease among whites and Indians contributes to the higher mortality in these groups.\n\nPopulation and genomic lessons from genetic analysis of two Indian populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nJuyal, Garima; Mondal, Mayukh; Luisi, Pierre; Laayouni, Hafid; Sood, Ajit; Midha, Vandana; Heutink, Peter; Bertranpetit, Jaume; Thelma, B K; Casals, Ferran\n\n2014-10-01\n\nIndian demographic history includes special features such as founder effects, interpopulation segregation, complex social structure with a caste system and elevated frequency of consanguineous marriages. It also presents a higher frequency for some rare mendelian disorders and in the last two decades increased prevalence of some complex disorders. Despite the fact that India represents about one-sixth of the human population, deep genetic studies from this terrain have been scarce. In this study, we analyzed high-density genotyping and whole-exome sequencing data of a North and a South Indian population. Indian populations show higher differentiation levels than those reported between populations of other continents. In this work, we have analyzed its consequences, by specifically assessing the transferability of genetic markers from or to Indian populations. We show that there is limited genetic marker portability from available genetic resources such as HapMap or the 1,000 Genomes Project to Indian populations, which also present an excess of private rare variants. Conversely, tagSNPs show a high level of portability between the two Indian populations, in contrast to the common belief that North and South Indian populations are genetically very different. By estimating kinship from mates and consanguinity in our data from trios, we also describe different patterns of assortative mating and inbreeding in the two populations, in agreement with distinct mating preferences and social structures. In addition, this analysis has allowed us to describe genomic regions under recent adaptive selection, indicating differential adaptive histories for North and South Indian populations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering demography for design and analysis of genetic studies, as well as the need for extending human genetic variation catalogs to new populations and particularly to those with particular demographic histories.\n\nMitochondrial population genomic analyses reveal population structure and demography of Indian Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nPubMed\n\nTyagi, Suchi; Das, Aparup\n\n2015-09-01\n\nInference on the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations could help in better management of malaria. A very recent study with mitochondrial (mt) genomes in global P. falciparum had revealed interesting evolutionary genetic patterns of Indian isolates in comparison to global ones. However, no population genetic study using the whole mt genome sequences of P. falciparum isolates collected in the entire distribution range in India has yet been performed. We herewith have analyzed 85 whole mt genomes (48 already published and 37 entirely new) sampled from eight differentially endemic Indian locations to estimate genetic diversity and infer population structure and historical demography of Indian P. falciparum. We found 19 novel Indian-specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 22 novel haplotypes segregating in Indian P. falciparum. Accordingly, high haplotype and nucleotide diversities were detected in Indian P. falciparum in comparison to many other global isolates. Indian P. falciparum populations were found to be moderately sub-structured with four different genetic clusters. Interestingly, group of local populations aggregate to form each cluster; while samples from Jharkhand and Odisha formed a single cluster, P. falciparum isolates from Asom formed an independent one. Similarly, Surat, Bilaspur and Betul formed a single cluster and Goa and Mangalore formed another. Interestingly, P. falciparum isolates from the two later populations were significantly genetically differentiated from isolates collected in other six Indian locations. Signature of historical population expansion was evident in five population samples, and the onset of expansion event was found to be very similar to African P. falciparum. In agreement with the previous finding, the estimated Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) and the effective population size were high in Indian P. falciparum. All these genetic features of Indian P. falciparum with high mt genome\n\nOptimized coral reconstructions of the Indian Ocean Dipole: An assessment of location and length considerations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbram, Nerilie J.; Dixon, Bronwyn C.; Rosevear, Madelaine G.; Plunkett, Benjamin; Gagan, Michael K.; Hantoro, Wahyoe S.; Phipps, Steven J.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD; or Indian Ocean Zonal Mode) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate oscillation that has profound impacts on rainfall distribution across the Indian Ocean region. Instrumental records provide a reliable representation of IOD behavior since 1958, while coral reconstructions currently extend the IOD history back to 1846. Large fluctuations in the number and intensity of positive IOD events over time are evident in these records, but it is unclear to what extent this represents multidecadal modulation of the IOD or an anthropogenically forced change in IOD behavior. In this study we explore the suitability of coral records from single-site locations in the equatorial Indian Ocean for capturing information about the occurrence and magnitude of positive IOD (pIOD) events. We find that the optimum location for coral reconstructions of the IOD occurs in the southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean, along the coast of Java and Sumatra between ~3 and 7Â°S. Here the strong ocean cooling and atmospheric drying during pIOD events are unambiguously recorded in coral oxygen isotope records, which capture up to 50% of IOD variance. Unforced experiments with coupled climate models suggest that potential biases in coral estimates of pIOD frequency are skewed toward overestimating pIOD recurrence intervals and become larger with shorter reconstruction windows and longer pIOD recurrence times. Model output also supports the assumption of stationarity in sea surface temperature relationships in the optimum IOD location that is necessary for paleoclimate reconstructions. This study provides a targeted framework for the future generation of paleoclimate records, including optimized coral reconstructions of past IOD variability.\n\nReconstructing East African rainfall and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures over the last centuries using data assimilation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKlein, FranÃ§ois; Goosse, Hugues\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe relationship between the East African rainfall and Indian Ocean sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) is well established. The potential interest of this covariance to improve reconstructions of both variables over the last centuries is examined here. This is achieved through an off-line method of data assimilation based on a particle filter, using hydroclimate-related records at four East African sites (Lake Naivasha, Lake Challa, Lake Malawi and Lake Masoko) and SSTs-related records at six oceanic sites spread over the Indian Ocean to constrain the Last Millennium Ensemble of simulations performed by CESM1. Skillful reconstructions of the Indian SSTs and East African rainfall can be obtained based on the assimilation of only one of these variables, when assimilating pseudo-proxy data deduced from the model CESM1. The skill of these reconstructions increases with the number of particles selected in the particle filter, although the improvement becomes modest beyond 99 particles. When considering a more realistic framework, the skill of the reconstructions is strongly deteriorated because of the model biases and the uncertainties of the real proxy-based reconstructions. However, it is still possible to obtain a skillful reconstruction of SSTs over most of the Indian Ocean only based on the assimilation of the six SST-related proxy records selected, as far as a local calibration is applied at all individual sites. This underlines once more the critical role of an adequate integration of the signal inferred from proxy records into the climate models for reconstructions based on data assimilation.\n\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of the angioarchitecture of the ciliary body of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).\n\nPubMed\n\nNatiello, Michelle; Samuelson, Don\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo examine the angioarchitecture of the ciliary body in the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), through the use of three-dimensional reconstruction. Specimens from West Indian manatee were preserved in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, serial sectioned and stained by Masson trichrome for light microscopic three-dimensional reconstruction and evaluation. The network of blood vessels in the ciliary processes of the West Indian manatee is fed by the major arterial circle that lies mostly near the base of the iris. The branching arterioles give rise to a capillary-sinusoidal bed that extends internally along each process, emptying into two sets of veins, one being elevated. The elevated and nonelevated veins join posteriorly before emptying into the choroidal venous system. The angioarchitecture of the ciliary body of the West Indian manatee is clearly unique when compared to those previously examined in land mammals. Three-dimensional reconstruction of paraffin sections is an effective means to evaluate vascular patterns in ocular specimens, especially those unavailable for corrosion casting.\n\nRecent Admixture in an Indian Population of African Ancestry\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNarang, Ankita; Jha, Pankaj; Rawat, Vimal; Mukhopadhayay, Arijit; Dash, Debasis; Basu, Analabha; Mukerji, Mitali\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIdentification and study of genetic variation in recently admixed populations not only provides insight into historical population events but also is a powerful approach for mapping disease loci. We studied a population (OG-W-IP) that is of African-Indian origin and has resided in the western part of India for 500 years; members of this population are believed to be descendants of the Bantu-speaking population of Africa. We have carried out this study by using a set of 18,534 autosomal markers common between Indian, CEPH-HGDP, andÂ HapMap populations. Principal-components analysis clearly revealed that the African-Indian population derives its ancestry from Bantu-speaking west-African as well as Indo-European-speaking north and northwest Indian population(s). STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analyses show that, overall, the OG-W-IPs derive 58.7% of their genomic ancestry from their African past and have very little inter-individual ancestry variation (8.4%). The extent of linkage disequilibrium also reveals that the admixture event has been recent. Functional annotation of genes encompassing the ancestry-informative markers that are closer in allele frequency to the Indian ancestral population revealed significant enrichment of biological processes, such as ion-channel activity, and cadherins. We briefly examine the implications of determining the genetic diversity of this population, which could provide opportunities for studies involving admixture mapping.

Two hundred participants (164 females, 36 males) with Angle's class I malocclusion (M.O). and well-balanced faces were selected and photographed in the frontal repose position. Analysis was done in Adobe Photoshop software. Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17.0. (IBM Corporation Armonk, New York, United States). Results suggested that females are more near to ideal ratios and males are more deviated from the ideal ratios. The proportions of males and females were not considerably different from each other. In Indian population, upper 3 rd facial height (TR-LC) was increased and mid-face height (LC-LN) was decreased; in lower 3 rd of the face, LN-CH was slightly increased in comparison to CH-ME. In facial widths, outer canthal width (LC-LC) was greater in the Indian population and mouth width (CH-CH) was normal. When compared with Indian population, Japanese participants had wider noses, outer canthal distance, and bitemporal width. It was concluded that significant difference was found between the proportions of the Indian population and ideal ratio. When Indian population was compared with Japanese and Caucasian populations, some parameters of facial proportions showed significant difference, which leads to the need for establishing standardized norms for various facial proportions in Indian population.\n\nThe earliest settlers' antiquity and evolutionary history of Indian populations: evidence from M2 mtDNA lineage\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground The \"out of Africa\" model postulating single \"southern route\" dispersal posits arrival of \"Anatomically Modern Human\" to Indian subcontinent around 66â70 thousand years before present (kyBP). However the contributions and legacy of these earliest settlers in contemporary Indian populations, owing to the complex past population dynamics and later migrations has been an issue of controversy. The high frequency of mitochondrial lineage \"M2\" consistent with its greater age and distribution suggests that it may represent the phylogenetic signature of earliest settlers. Accordingly, we attempted to re-evaluate the impact and contribution of earliest settlers in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of contemporary Indian populations; using our newly sequenced 72 and 4 published complete mitochondrial genomes of this lineage. Results The M2 lineage, harbouring two deep rooting subclades M2a and M2b encompasses approximately one tenth of the mtDNA pool of studied tribes. The phylogeographic spread and diversity indices of M2 and its subclades among the tribes of different geographic regions and linguistic phyla were investigated in detail. Further the reconstructed demographic history of M2 lineage as a surrogate of earliest settlers' component revealed that the demographic events with pronounced regional variations had played pivotal role in shaping the complex net of populations phylogenetic relationship in Indian subcontinent. Conclusion Our results suggest that tribes of southern and eastern region along with Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic speakers of central India are the modern representatives of earliest settlers of subcontinent. The Last Glacial Maximum aridity and post LGM population growth mechanised some sort of homogeneity and redistribution of earliest settlers' component in India. The demic diffusion of agriculture and associated technologies around 3 kyBP, which might have marginalized hunter-gatherer, is coincidental with the decline of\n\nBiometric study of the internal dimensions of subglottis and upper trachea in adult Indian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrasanna Kumar, S; Ravikumar, A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe anatomy of the larynx and trachea is well described in literature, however the intraluminal dimensions and contour of the subglottis has not been well documented. Subglottis and trachea are dynamic structures and the internal dimensions and contours have been studied only on cadavers or by plain radiograph which has many technical and measurement errors. No data is available about the internal dimensions of the subglottic and trachea in Indian population. This is the first documented study to measure the dimensions of the trachea and subglottis in Indian population. The aim of this study is to measure the internal dimensions and contour of the subglottis and upper trachea of adult Indian population. We conducted cross-sectional, observational study in a university hospital in south India to measure the dimensions of the internal subglottic and upper tracheal lumen. CT scan with 3D reconstruction with multiplanar sections was used for precise measurements. Forty-eight subjects (30 male and 18 female) who had undergone CT scan of the neck and thorax for reasons other than airway compromise were included in the study. The internal coronal diameter (CD), sagittal diameter (SD), and circumference was measured at various levels from 5 to 70Â mm below the level of glottis, in the subglottis and upper trachea. Measurements of the scan for each subject were done independently by a radiologist and ENT surgeon and average of the two were documented values of each subject. These measurements were then statistically analyzed using SSPS software. The mean CD of adult Indian male ranged from 13.18 to 17.68Â mm. The average intraluminal circumference ranged from 48.82Â mm at the subglottis 5Â mm from the glottis to a maximum of 54.96 at 30Â mm. The mean CD of adult Indian female ranged from 8.7 to 15.34Â mm The average intraluminal circumference ranged from 36.5 at 5Â mm and a maximum of 43.05 at 70Â mm. The 95% CI for the coronal, sagittal and circumference of the subglottis\n\nMultiproxy Reduced-Dimension Reconstruction of Holocene Tropical Pacific SST Fields and Indian Monsoon Variability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGill, E.; Rajagopalan, B.; Molnar, P. H.; Marchitto, T. M., Jr.; Kushnir, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe develop a multiproxy reduced-dimension methodology that blends magnesium calcium (Mg/Ca) and alkenone (UK'37) paleo sea surface temperature (SST) records from the eastern and western equatorial Pacific to recreate snapshots of full field SSTs and zonal wind anomalies from 10 to 2 ka BP in 2000-year increments. In the reconstruction, the zonal SST difference (average west Pacific SST minus average east Pacific SST) is largest at 10 ka (0.26Â°C), with coldest SST anomalies of -0.9Â°C in the eastern equatorial Pacific and concurrent easterly maximum zonal wind anomalies of 7 m s-1 throughout the central Pacific. From 10 to 2 ka, the entire equatorial Pacific warms, but at a faster rate in the east than in the west. These patterns are broadly consistent with previous inferences of reduced El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation variability associated with a cooler and/or \"La NiÃ±a-like\" state during the early to middle Holocene. At present there is a strong negative correlation between tropical pacific SSTs and Indian summer monsoon strength. Assuming ENSO-monsoon teleconnections were the same during early Holocene, we would expect a cooler tropical Pacific to enhance the summer Indian monsoon. To test this idea, we used the same tropical Pacific SST proxy records and a similar reduced-dimension technique to reconstruct fields of Arabian Sea wind-stress curl and Indian summer monsoon precipitation. Reconstructions for 10 ka reveal wind-stress curl anomalies of 30% greater than present day off the coastlines of Oman and Yemen, which suggest greater coastal upwelling and an enhanced monsoon jet during this time. Spatial rainfall reconstructions reveal the greatest difference in precipitation at 10 ka over the core monsoon region ( 20-60% greater than present day). Specifically, reconstructions from 10 ka reveal 40-60% greater rainfall over North West India, a region home to abundant paleo-lake records spanning the Holocene but is at present remarkably dry ( 200-450 mm of annual\n\nBreast density in screening mammography in Indian population - Is it different from western population?\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Tulika; Khandelwal, Niranjan; Singla, Veenu; Kumar, Dileep; Gupta, Madhu; Singh, Gurpreet; Bal, Amanjit\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMammography is the only method presently considered appropriate for mass screening of breast cancer. However, higher breast density was strongly associated with lower mammographic sensitivity. Breast density is also identified as independent and strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Studies have shown women with high breast density have four to six times increased risk of breast cancer as compare to women with fatty breast. It varies between different age group it generally decreases with increasing age in postmenopausal women and it can be different in different ethnic groups and people from different geographical areas. This study evaluates the breast density in Indian population and its relationship with the age. We reviewed of all screening mammography examinations performed from May 2012 to January 2015 at our institute PGIMER, Chandigarh, INDIA. Descriptive analyses were used to examine the association between age and breast density. A total of 6132 screening mammograms were performed. Each subgroup categorized by decade of age. There was a significant inverse relationship between age and breast density (PÂ <Â .001). Twenty-two percent of patients between 40 and 49Â years old had dense breasts. This percentage decreased to 9% of women in their 50s. Only 7% of women in their 60s and 8% of women in their 70s had dense breasts. This data has been compared with the Western study done in New York University (NYU) shows there is significant difference (P value <.05) in the breast density in Indian and Western population with more Indians having ACR Grade 1 and 2 and Western population having 2 and 3. We found an inverse relationship between patient age and mammographic breast density. However, there were a large proportion of young women who had lower grades of mammographic density which could potentially benefit from the use of routine screening mammography in this subgroup of patients. Moreover, the breast density of Indian population is less when compared to\n\nTwo stage ear/microtia reconstruction using costal cartilage.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalaji, S M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nReconstruction of Grade III microtia is a challenging entity in maxillofacial esthetic rehabilitation. Several advocacies and philosophies exist in this field. The aim of the manuscript is to present a single South Indian Experience with Ear reconstruction among South Indian Population. Retrospective analysis of unilateral Grade III microtia reconstruction was performed. Using a set of predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the population was selected. Outcome measures in terms of the ear size, auriculocephalic angle, and the conchal depth were measured in the reconstructed and normal side. Descriptive statistics is presented. Twenty-four patients formed the study group and had undergone the classical two-stage reconstruction in a similar fashion. The mean ear size in normal side was 65.8 Â± 2.8 mm whereas on the reconstructed side, it was 61.3 Â± 5.8 mm. The center's technique achieved above 75% similarity as that of the other normal ear. The mean auriculocephalic angle was 44.6 Â± 5.2Â° whereas for the surgically reconstructed ear, it was 41.9 Â± 2.6Â°. Overall, in these patients, we achieved a 79.94% similarity of auriculocephalic angle in the reconstructed ear as compared to the normal auricle. The conchal depth was 19.2 Â± 2.1 mm and 16.6 Â± 1.9 mm for normal and reconstructed ear, respectively. In terms of conchal depth, the present study group showed an achievement of 82.88% of accuracy even after a prolonged follow-up. The center employs a classic two stage reconstruction with a customized prosthesis that helps to avoid the loss of projection geometry and minimizes adhesion, infection, and early loss of structural stability.\n\nBariatric Nutrition Guidelines for the Indian Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nRemedios, Carlyne; Bhasker, Aparna Govil; Dhulla, Neha; Dhar, Shilpa; Lakdawala, Muffazal\n\n2016-05-01\n\nBariatric surgery numbers have seen a sharp rise in India in the last decade. A country known for its undernourished population has seen economic growth and with it, greater influence of western culture and foods. The obesity epidemic is on the rise here and India is one of the 10 most obese nations of the world being second only to China in the number of type 2 diabetes. Nutritionists in India often rely on recommendations and guidelines meant for the Caucasian population. Religious and cultural practices influence the dietary habits and patterns of the Indian population to a great extent; because of which the nutritional requirements are very different. This document was put together with an aim to provide nutritionists with recommendations on how to manage the Indian bariatric patient. A bariatric nutrition round table meeting was initiated by the Centre for Obesity and Digestive Surgery (CODS) to bring together experts in the field of bariatric nutrition to review current data on nutritional deficiencies in the morbid obese and existing post-operative deficiencies and to formulate nutritional recommendations for bariatric/metabolic surgery specific to patients from India. Percentage of nutritional deficiencies and reasons for the same were identified among the Indian population and recommendations were made to suit this particular population. It is recommended that all patients undergo compulsory pre-operative nutritional counseling and nutritional investigations and that nutritional follow-up be continued lifelong. In addition, long-term implications like hypoglycemia, dumping syndrome, sugar cravings, and weight regain, need to be picked up and managed efficiently. Most importantly, post-operative supplementation is a must irrespective of type of surgery.\n\nThree Plate Reconstruction in the Eastern Indian Ocean: New Constraints on Wharton and Australian-Antarctic basins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJacob, J.; Dyment, J.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nUnderstanding the continuous seismicity and repeated occurrence of major earthquakes in Sumatra and the neighboring area requires detailed constrains on the subducting plate. In this study we analyze the past plate kinematics evolution of the Wharton basin, eastern Indian Ocean through a three plate reconstruction involving Australia (AUS), Antarctica (ANT), and India (IND). We compile marine magnetic identifications in the Australian-Antarctic Basin [1,2], the Crozet and Central Indian basins (Yatheesh et al, in prep.) and the Wharton Basin [3]. The Wharton Basin is characterized by an extinct spreading center dated by anomaly 18 (38 Ma). The southern flank of the basin exhibits a continuous sequence of anomalies 20n (42 Ma) to 34n (84 Ma), whereas the northern flank lacks some of the older anomalies because a significant part has been subducted in the Sunda Trench. The three-plate reconstructions have provided set of rotation parameters describing the evolution of IND-AUS. Using these parameters, we have reconstructed the missing isochrons of the northern flank and the detailed geometry of the subducted part of the Wharton basin. Such an exercise provides useful constraints on the age and structure of the plate in subduction under Indonesia. As a byproduct, the three plate reconstruction provided set of rotation parameters for AUS-ANT as well, which constrains the conjugate fit between the basins. Previous studies [1,2,4,5] have achieved such a fit on the base of ill-defined fracture zones. We consider the well-defined fracture zones from the Crozet, Central Indian, and Wharton basins, but avoid using the poor fracture zone imprints from the Australian-Antarctic Basin. As a result from this approach, we conclude that the relative motion of AUS with respect to ANT initially followed a north-south direction, then changed to northwest-southeast at anomaly 32ny, and reverted to northeast southwest at anomaly 24no prior to the establishment of the Southeast Indian\n\nEvaluation of the nasolabial angle in the Indian population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDua, Vinay; Gupta, Shilpa; Singh, Chanjyot\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNasolabial angle has become the angle depicting the esthetics so has attained the prime importance in the treatment planning.

A radiographic cephalometric study was undertaken with 45 subjects of Indian origin to evaluate and compare with their result. The method of evaluation was according to the criteria given by Dr. Jay P Fitzergerald in AJODO 1992; 102:328-34. Significant decrease in nasolabial angle values was found in case of Indian population as compared to white adults.

Morphological differences caused by factors like genetic and environmental exposures, generates a necessity to construct population specific brain templates. Brain image analysis performed using brain templates from Caucasian population may not be appropriate for non-Caucasian population. In this study, our objective was to construct an Indian brain template from a large population (Nâ¯=â¯157 subjects) and compare the morphometric parameters of this template with that of Chinese-56 and MNI-152 templates. In addition, using an independent MRI data of 15 Indian subjects, we also evaluated the potential registration accuracy differences using these three templates. Indian brain template was constructed using iterative routines as per established procedures. We compared our Indian template with standard MNI-152 template and Chinese template by measuring global brain features. We also examined accuracy of registration by aligning 15 new Indian brains to Indian, Chinese and MNI templates. Furthermore, we supported our measurement protocol with inter-rater and intra-rater reliability analysis. Our results showed that there were significant differences in global brain features of Indian template in comparison with Chinese and MNI brain templates. The results of registration accuracy analysis revealed that fewer deformations are required when Indian brains are registered to Indian template as compared to Chinese and MNI templates. This study concludes that population specific Indian template is likely to be more appropriate for structural and functional image analysis of Indian population. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Kinship information is important for determining mating structures, notably in endangered populations. Although many solutions exist for reconstructing full sibling relationships, few exist for half-siblings. We consider the problem of determining whether a proposed half-sibling population reconstruction is valid under Mendelian inheritance assumptions. We show that this problem is NP-complete and provide a 0/1 integer program that identifies the minimum number of individuals that must be removed from a population in order for the reconstruction to become valid. We also present SibJoin, a heuristic-based clustering approach based on Mendelian genetics, which is strikingly fast. The software is available at http://github.com/ddexter/SibJoin.git+. Our SibJoin algorithm is reasonably accurate and thousands of times faster than existing algorithms. The heuristic is used to infer a half-sibling structure for a population which was, until recently, too large to evaluate.\n\nA Custom Made Intrinsic Silicone Shade Guide for Indian Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBehanam, Mohammed; Ahila, S.C.; Jei, J. Brintha\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction Replication of natural skin colour in maxillofacial prosthesis has been traditionally done using trial and error method, as concrete shade guides are unavailable till date. Hence a novel custom made intrinsic silicone shade guide has been attempted for Indian population. Aim Reconstruction of maxillofacial defects is challenging, as achieving an aesthetic result is not always easy. A concoction of a novel intrinsic silicone shade guide was contemplated for the study and its reproducibility in clinical practice was analysed. Materials and Methods Medical grade room temperature vulcanising silicone was used for the fabrication of shade tabs. The shade guide consisted of three main groups I, II and III which were divided based upon the hues yellow, red and blue respectively. Five distinct intrinsic pigments were added in definite proportions to subdivide each group of different values from lighter to darker shades. A total number of 15 circular shade tabs comprised the guide. To validate the usage of the guide, visual assessment of colour matching was done by four investigators to investigate the consent of perfect colour correspondence. Data was statistically analysed using kappa coefficients. Results The kappa values were found to be 0.47 to 0.78 for yellow based group I, 0.13 to 0.65 for red based group II, and 0.07 to 0.36 for blue based group III. This revealed that the shade tabs of yellow and red based hues matched well and showed a statistically good colour matching. Conclusion This intrinsic silicone shade guide can be effectively utilised for fabrication of maxillofacial prosthesis with silicone in Indian population. A transparent colour formula with definite proportioning of intrinsic pigments is provided for obtaining an aesthetic match to skin tone.

A total of 100 Panoramic radiographs were selected from the archives of PMNM Dental College and the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, of which 50 radiographs belonged to a north Indian population and 50 radiographs belonged to a local population of Bagalkot Karnataka. The position of the MF was classified into 6 positions depending on the relationship to the mandibular teeth. The distance from the superior border of the MF to the lower border of the mandible was also measured. The most common position of the MF was along the long axis of the second premolar in the north Indian population and in south Indian populations it was found to be between the first and second premolar. Descriptive analysis was used to compare the distance between the superior border of the mental foramen and the lower border of the mandible bilaterally. There was a significant difference in the position of the MF between the north and south Indian populations.

Any pathogenic variation in these genes alters the function of the receptor and leads to Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other cardiovascular diseases. This study was aimed at screening the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes in Hypercholesterolemic patients to define the genetic spectrum of FH in Indian population. Familial Hypercholesterolemia patients (n=78) of South Indian Tamil population with LDL cholesterol and Total cholesterol levels above 4.9mmol/l and 7.5mmol/l with family history of Myocardial infarction were involved. DNA was isolated by organic extraction method from blood samples and LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 gene exons were amplified using primers that cover exon-intron boundaries. The amplicons were screened using High Resolution Melt (HRM) Analysis and the screened samples were sequenced after purification. This study reports 20 variations in South Indian population for the first time. In this set of variations 9 are novel variations which are reported for the first time, 11 were reported in other studies also. The in silico analysis for all the variations detected in this study were done to predict the probabilistic effect in pathogenicity of FH. This study adds 9 novel variations and 11 recurrent variations to the spectrum of LDLR gene mutations in Indian population. All these variations are reported for the first time in Indian population. This spectrum of variations was different from the variations of previous Indian reports. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

More and more researchers tend to describe the components of social systems in a more detailed level. Any simulation needs the support of population data to initialize and implement the simulation systems. However, it's impossible to get the data which provide full information about individuals and households. We propose a two-step method to reconstruct a large-scale population for a Chinese city according to Chinese culture. Firstly, a baseline population is generated through gathering individuals into households one by one; secondly, social relationships such as friendship are assigned to the baseline population. Through a case study, a population of 3,112,559 individuals gathered in 1,133,835 households is reconstructed for Urumqi city, and the results show that the generated data can respect the real data quite well. The generated data can be applied to support modeling of some social phenomenon.\n\n[Preliminary study of HTLV-I seroprevalence in Chilean Indian populations].\n\nPubMed\n\nCartier, L; Tajima, K; Araya, F; Castillo, J L; Zaninovic, V; Hayami, M; Imai, J; Born, P; CÃ¡rdenas, M; Moreno, J\n\n1993-03-01\n\nAiming to seek the origin and define the prevalence of HTLV-1 infections, 464 blood samples from aboriginal populations proceeding from isolated regions of the north and south of Chile were studied. Antibodies against HTLV were measured with agglutination tests and confirmed with immuno-fluorescence and Western Blotting. Seven out of 107 (6.5%) blood samples from Atacama indians, 2 out of 202 (1%) from Mapuche indians and 3 out of 155 (1.9%) from Huilliche aborigines were positive. These results highlight an important presence of the virus in indigenous populations, specially in the extremes of the country. These findings could suggest an indigenous (mongoloid) origin of HTLV-1 in Chile, specially in Chiloe, where apparently there has been no contact with african or japanese populations, that could be the origin of the contamination.\n\nEnvironmental reconstructions of the upper 500 m of the southern Indian Ocean over the last 40 ka using Radiolarian (Protista) proxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRogers, John; De Deckker, Patrick\n\n2011-04-01\n\nIn 2007, we demonstrated that radiolarians are proxies for a wide range of oceanic physico-chemical properties from the surface to depths of up to 500 m below sea level. In this study, our results are refined and Correspondence Analysis (CA) scores derived from census counts of radiolarian subfossils from southern Indian Ocean core-tops are correlated with the physico-chemical properties of the region obtained from the 2005 World Ocean Database. Calibration and regression techniques are employed to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions spanning the last 40 ka for four Indian Ocean cores MD88-769 [46Â°04'S 90Â°06'E], MD88-770 [46Â°01'S 96Â°27'E], MD94-102 [43Â°30'S 79Â°50'E], and MD94-103 [45Â°35'S 86Â°31'E], all from close to the Southeast Indian Ridge. For the first time, reconstructions of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the silicate, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations for a range of water depths are proved possible. Changes of the oceanic environment and the movement of water masses over the last 40 ka, as suggested by these reconstructions, are discussed. During Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 (MIS-2 and MIS-3), the water column at some of the core sites has similar characteristics to the waters south of the Polar Front today. At the MIS-1/MIS-2 transition, the development of the Subantarctic Mode Water is apparent. Temperature reconstructions include evidence of the Antarctic Cold Reversal and the Holocene Optimum.\n\n77 FR 61780 - Preparation of the 2013 American Indian Population and Labor Force Report\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-10-11\n\n...

Abundant literature is available on anthropometric analysis of Caucasians and Orientals, without similar references on the Indian nose and its regional differences. Thus, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional epidemiological study of 1000 volunteers, with equal number of subjects derived from five geographic groups, namely North, Central, West, South, and the Himalayan region, to determine differences in nasal morphology of Indian population and among its various regions. The objective was to establish a standard Indian data for guidance in nasal surgery. All measurements were deduced using photographic analysis. The mean nasal height and width of our study population was 50.48 and 36.59Â mm, respectively. Nasal profile varied among all five regions of the country. North Indians had the longest (52.69Â mm nasal height) but the narrowest nose (35.01Â mm width), thus having a leptorrhine nose with Caucasoid features. South Indians had the broadest nose (nasal widthÂ =Â 38.66Â mm), whereas subjects from the Himalayan region had the shortest nose (nasal heightÂ =Â 47.2Â mm). Indians on average had a mesorrhine nose as compared to Caucasians and Orientals who have a leptorrhine nose and Africans who have a platyrrhine nose. We thus conclude that the Indian nose should be considered a different entity in comparison to the nose of Caucasian, Oriental, and African populations. There are obvious differences in the facial architecture of people from different regions within the country. Therefore, appropriate adjustments need to be made according to different racial descents during nasal surgeries so as to give patients results that blend harmoniously with other facial features.

This anthropometric survey included a volunteer sample of 100 young Indian women ages 18 to 35 years with Indian parents and no history of previous surgery or trauma to the nose. Standardized frontal, lateral, oblique, and basal photographs of the subjects' noses were taken, and 12 standard anthropometric measurements of the nose were determined. The results were compared with published standards for North American white women. In addition, nine nasal indices were calculated and compared with the standards for North American white women. The nose of Indian women differs significantly from the white nose. All the nasal measurements for the Indian women were found to be significantly different from those for North American white women. Seven of the nine nasal indices also differed significantly. Anthropometric analysis suggests differences between the Indian female nose and the North American white nose. Thus, a single aesthetic ideal is inadequate. Noses of Indian women are smaller and wider, with a less projected and rounded tip than the noses of white women. This study established the nasal anthropometric norms for nasal parameters, which will serve as a guide for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery in Indian women.\n\nCancer Control in American Indian and Alaska Native Populations\n\nCancer.gov\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are disproportionately affected by certain cancers.

Linguistic and anthropological evidence point to Indo-Aryan ethnic groups from North-western India as the ancestral parental population of Roma. Recently, a strong genetic hint supporting this theory came from a study of a private mutation causing primary congenital glaucoma. In the present study, complete mitochondrial control sequences of Iberian Roma and previously published maternal lineages of other European Roma were analyzed in order to establish the genetic affinities among Roma groups, determine the degree of admixture with neighbouring populations, infer the migration routes followed since the first arrival to Europe, and survey the origin of Roma within the Indian subcontinent. Our results show that the maternal lineage composition in the Roma groups follows a pattern of different migration routes, with several founder effects, and low effective population sizes along their dispersal. Our data allowed the confirmation of a North/West migration route shared by Polish, Lithuanian and Iberian Roma. Additionally, eleven Roma founder lineages were identified and degrees of admixture with host populations were estimated. Finally, the comparison with an extensive database of Indian sequences allowed us to identify the Punjab state, in North-western India, as the putative ancestral homeland of the European Roma, in agreement with previous linguistic and anthropological studies.

Interindividual variation in sulfonation capacity is important for determining an individual's response to xenobiotics. SNPs in SULTs, mainly SULT1A1 have been associated with cancer risk and also with response to therapeutic agents. Copy number variation (CNVs) in SULT1A1 is found to be correlated with altered enzyme activity. This short report primarily focuses on CNV in SULT1A1 and its distribution among different ethnic populations around the globe. Frequency distribution of SULT1A1 copy number (CN) in 157 healthy Indian individuals was assessed using florescent-based quantitative PCR assay. A range of 1 to >4 copies, with a frequency of SULT1A1 CN =2 (64.9%) the highest, was observed in our (Indian) population. Upon comparative analysis of frequency distribution of SULT1A1 CN among diverse population groups, a statistically significant difference was observed between Indians (our data) and African-American (AA) (p =â0.0001) and South African (Tswana) (p <â0.0001) populations. Distribution of CNV in the Indian population was found to be similar to that in European-derived populations of American and Japanese. CNV of SULT1A1 varies significantly among world populations and may be one of the determinants of health and diseases.\n\nAnalysis of the curve of Spee and the curve of Wilson in adult Indian population: A three-dimensional measurement study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSurendran, Sowmya Velekkatt; Hussain, Sharmila; Bhoominthan, S; Nayar, Sanjna; Jayesh, Ragavendra\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWhen reconstructing the occlusal curvatures dentists often use a 4-inch radii arc as a rough standard based on Monson spherical theory. The use of an identical radius for the curve of Spee for all patients may not be appropriate because each patient is individually different. The validity of application of this theory in the Indian population and the present study has been undertaken. This study is an attempt to evaluate the curve of Spee and curve of Wilson in young Indian population using three dimensional analysis. This study compared the radius and the depth of right and left, maxillary and mandibular curves of Spee and the radius of maxillary and mandibular curves of Wilson in males and females. The cusp tips of canines, buccal cusp tips of premolars and molars and palatal/lingual cusp tips of second molars of 60 maxillary and 60 mandibular casts were obtained. Three-dimensional (x, y, z) coordinates of the cusp tips of the molars, premolars, and canines of the right and left sides of the maxilla and mandible were obtained with three dimensional coordinate measuring machine. The radius and the depth of right and left, maxillary and mandibular curves of Spee and the radius of maxillary and mandibular curves of Wilson were measured by means of computer software Metrologic-XG. Pearson's correlation test and Independent t-test were used to test the statistical significance (Î±=.05). The values of curve of Spee and curve of Wilson in Indian population obtained from this study were higher than the 4 inch (100 mm) radius proposed by Monson. These findings suggest ethnic differences in the radius of curve of Spee and curve of Wilson.\n\nPopulation structure of humpback whales from their breeding grounds in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosenbaum, Howard C; Pomilla, Cristina; Mendez, Martin; Leslie, Matthew S; Best, Peter B; Findlay, Ken P; Minton, Gianna; Ersts, Peter J; Collins, Timothy; Engel, Marcia H; Bonatto, Sandro L; Kotze, Deon P G H; MeÃ¿er, Mike; Barendse, Jaco; Thornton, Meredith; Razafindrakoto, Yvette; Ngouessono, Solange; Vely, Michel; Kiszka, Jeremy\n\n2009-10-08\n\nAlthough humpback whales are among the best-studied of the large whales, population boundaries in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) have remained largely untested. We assess population structure of SH humpback whales using 1,527 samples collected from whales at fourteen sampling sites within the Southwestern and Southeastern Atlantic, the Southwestern Indian Ocean, and Northern Indian Ocean (Breeding Stocks A, B, C and X, respectively). Evaluation of mtDNA population structure and migration rates was carried out under different statistical frameworks. Using all genetic evidence, the results suggest significant degrees of population structure between all ocean basins, with the Southwestern and Northern Indian Ocean most differentiated from each other. Effective migration rates were highest between the Southeastern Atlantic and the Southwestern Indian Ocean, followed by rates within the Southeastern Atlantic, and the lowest between the Southwestern and Northern Indian Ocean. At finer scales, very low gene flow was detected between the two neighbouring sub-regions in the Southeastern Atlantic, compared to high gene flow for whales within the Southwestern Indian Ocean. Our genetic results support the current management designations proposed by the International Whaling Commission of Breeding Stocks A, B, C, and X as four strongly structured populations. The population structure patterns found in this study are likely to have been influenced by a combination of long-term maternally directed fidelity of migratory destinations, along with other ecological and oceanographic features in the region.\n\nPopulation Structure of Humpback Whales from Their Breeding Grounds in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRosenbaum, Howard C.; Pomilla, Cristina; Mendez, Martin; Leslie, Matthew S.; Best, Peter B.; Findlay, Ken P.; Minton, Gianna; Ersts, Peter J.; Collins, Timothy; Engel, Marcia H.; Bonatto, Sandro L.; Kotze, Deon P.

Genetic input from several unique source populations and from the unique social architecture provided by the caste system has shaped the current genetic landscape of India. In the present study 200 individuals each from three upper-caste and four middle-caste Hindu groups and from two Muslim populations in North India were examined for 10 polymorphic Alu insertions (PAIs). The investigated PAIs exhibit high levels of polymorphism and average heterozygosity. Limited interpopulation variance and genetic flow in the present study suggest admixture. The results of this study demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, the caste system has not provided an impermeable barrier to genetic exchange among Indian groups.\n\nAmerican Indians. 1970 Census of Population, Subject Reports.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDepartment of Commerce, Washington, DC.\n\nThe in-depth statistical profile of the American Indian's condition today is the most comprehensive ever done on the subject by the Bureau of the Census (U.S. Department of Commerce, Social and Economic Statistics Administration).

To understand the population structure and demographic history of this group in detail, we analyzed Indian and Pakistani Parsi populations using high-resolution genetic variation data on autosomal and uniparental loci (Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA). Additionally, we also assayed mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms among ancient Parsi DNA samples excavated from Sanjan, in present day Gujarat, the place of their original settlement in India. Among present-day populations, the Parsis are genetically closest to Iranian and the Caucasus populations rather than their South Asian neighbors. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians and we estimate that the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations occurred ~1,200Â years ago. Enriched homozygosity in the Parsi reflects their recent isolation and inbreeding. We also observed 48% South-Asian-specific mitochondrial lineages among the ancient samples, which might have resulted from the assimilation of local females during the initial settlement. Finally, we show that Parsis are genetically closer to Neolithic Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East. Our results are consistent with the historically-recorded migration of the Parsi populations to South Asia in the 7th century and in agreement with their assimilation into the Indian sub-continent's population and cultural milieu \"like sugar in milk\". Moreover, in a wider context our results support a major demographic transition in West Asia due to the Islamic conquest.\n\nPopulation Stratification and Underrepresentation of Indian Subcontinent Genetic Diversity in the 1000 Genomes Project Dataset\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSengupta, Dhriti; Choudhury, Ananyo; Basu, Analabha; Ramsay, MichÃ¨le\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGenomic variation in Indian populations is of great interest due to the diversity of ancestral components, social stratification, endogamy and complex admixture patterns. With an expanding population of 1.2 billion, India is also a treasure trove to catalogue innocuous as well as clinically relevant rare mutations. Recent studies have revealed four dominant ancestries in populations from mainland India: Ancestral North-Indian (ANI), Ancestral South-Indian (ASI), Ancestral TibetoâBurman (ATB) and Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA). The 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) Phase-3 data include about 500 genomes from five linguistically defined Indian-Subcontinent (IS) populations (Punjabi, Gujrati, Bengali, Telugu and Tamil) some of whom are recent migrants to USA or UK. Comparative analyses show that despite the distinct geographic origins of the KGP-IS populations, the ANI component is predominantly represented in this dataset. Previous studies demonstrated population substructure in the HapMap Gujrati population, and we found evidence for additional substructure in the Punjabi and Telugu populations. These substructured populations have characteristic/significant differences in heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficients. Moreover, we demonstrate that the substructure is better explained by factors like differences in proportion of ancestral components, and endogamy driven social structure rather than invoking a novel ancestral component to explain it. Therefore, using language and/or geography as a proxy for an ethnic unit is inadequate for many of the IS populations. This highlights the necessity for more nuanced sampling strategies or corrective statistical approaches, particularly for biomedical and population genetics research in India.

Quantitative analysis of the hippocampus using volumetry is commonly being used in the diagnosis of MTS and is being used as a marker in prognostication of seizure control. Although normative data for hippocampal volume (HV) is available for the western population, no such data is available for the Indian population. The aim of the study was to establish normative data for HV for the Indian population, which can aid in the accurate diagnosis of MTS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 200 healthy volunteers were acquired using a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scanner. Manual segmentation and volumetry was done using Siemens Syngo software. The data was analyzed using two tailed t-test to detect associations between HV and age, gender, and education. The data so obtained was also correlated with the data available from the rest of the world. A mean HV of 2.411 cm(3) (standard deviation -0.299) was found in the study, which was significantly smaller when compared to the data from the western population. The right hippocampus was larger than the left, with a mean volume of 2.424 cm(3) and 2.398 cm(3), respectively. HV was detected to be significantly higher in males. No association was found between HV and age and education. The values obtained in this study may be adopted as a standard in the evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy.\n\nUncovering the Anthropogenic Sea Level Change using an Improved Sea Level Reconstruction for the Indian Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, P.; Hamlington, B.; Thompson, P. R.; Han, W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDespite having some of the world's most densely populated and vulnerable coastal regions, sea level (SL) variability in the Indian Ocean (IO) has received considerably less attention than the Pacific Ocean. Differentiating the internal variability from the long-term trend in global mean sea level (GMSL) at decadal time-scales is vital for planning and mitigation efforts in the IO region. Understanding the dynamics of internal and anthropogenic SL change is essential for understanding the dynamic pathways that link the IO basin to terrestrial climates world-wide. With a sparse pre-satellite observational record of the IO, the Indo-Pacific internal climate variability is difficult to represent accurately. However, an improved representation of pre-satellite SL variability can be achieved by using a multivariate reconstruction technique. By using cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions (CSEOFs) that can capture time-varying spatial patterns, gaps in the historical record when observations are sparse are filled using spatial relationships from time periods when the observational network is dense. This reconstruction method combines SL data and sea surface temperature (SST) to create a SL reconstruction that spans a period from 1900 to present, long enough to study climate signals over interannual to decadal time scales. This study aims at estimating the component of SL rise that relates to anthropogenic forcing by identifying and removing the fraction related to internal variability. An improved understanding of how the internal climate variability can affect the IO SL trend and variability, will provide an insight into the future SL changes. It is also important to study links between SL and climate variability in the past to understand how SL will respond to similar climatic events in the future and if this response will be influenced by the changing climate.\n\nHistorical pedigree reconstruction from extant populations using PArtitioning of RElatives (PREPARE).\n\nPubMed\n\nShem-Tov, Doron; Halperin, Eran\n\n2014-06-01\n\nRecent technological improvements in the field of genetic data extraction give rise to the possibility of reconstructing the historical pedigrees of entire populations from the genotypes of individuals living today. Current methods are still not practical for real data scenarios as they have limited accuracy and assume unrealistic assumptions of monogamy and synchronized generations. In order to address these issues, we develop a new method for pedigree reconstruction, [Formula: see text], which is based on formulations of the pedigree reconstruction problem as variants of graph coloring. The new formulation allows us to consider features that were overlooked by previous methods, resulting in a reconstruction of up to 5 generations back in time, with an order of magnitude improvement of false-negatives rates over the state of the art, while keeping a lower level of false positive rates. We demonstrate the accuracy of [Formula: see text] compared to previous approaches using simulation studies over a range of population sizes, including inbred and outbred populations, monogamous and polygamous mating patterns, as well as synchronous and asynchronous mating.\n\nUnraveling Brazilian Indian population prostate good health: clinical, anthropometric and genetic features\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Lima, Mario M.; Reis, Leonardo O.; Ferreira, Ubirajara; Cardoso, Ulieme Oliveira; Barbieri, Raquel Bueno; de MendonÃ§a, Gustavo B.; Ward, Laura S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose To compare dietary, lifestyle, clinical, anthropometric, genetic and prostatic features of Brazilian Indians and non-Indians (Amazon). Methods 315 men, 228 Indians and 89 non-Indians, â¥40 years old were submitted to digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), testosterone, TP53 and GSTP1 genotyping, anthropometric, lifestyle, dietary, personal and familial medical history. Prostatic symptoms were evaluated with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Results Macuxis and Yanomamis represented 43.6% and 14.5% of Indians respectively who spontaneously referred no prostate symptoms. Mean IPSS was 7, range 3-19, with only 15% of moderate symptoms (score 8-19); Mean age was 54.7 years, waist circumference 86.6 cm, BMI 23.9 kg/m2. Yanomamis presented both lower BMI (21.4 versus 24.8 and 23.3, p=0,001) and prostate volume than Macuxis and âother ethnic groupsâ (15 versus 20, p=0.001). Testosterone (414 versus 502 and 512, p=0.207) and PSA (0.48 versus 0.6 and 0.41, p=0.349) were similar with progressive PSA increase with aging. Val/Val correlated with lower PSA (p=0.0361). Indians compared to control population presented: - TP53 super representation of Arg/Arg haplotype, 74.5% versus 42.5%, p<0.0001. -GSTP1 Ile/Ile 35.3% versus 60.9%; Ile/Val 45.9% versus 28.7%; Val/Val 18.8% versus 10.3%; p=0.0003. Conclusions Observed specific dietary, lifestyle, anthropometric and genetic profile for TP53 and GSTP1 may contribute to Brazilian Indian population prostate good health.

However, a knowledge of the normal osteometry of this region in the Indian population is critically important for the operating surgeon as it may influence the surgical technique as well as the choice, size and configurations of the implants. It is also important to determine whether critical differences exist between the osteometric data of Indians and the rest of the world for this part of the anatomy. Accordingly, the present study is an attempt to quantitate the osteometric indices for the anatomically normal CVJ in Indian subjects. We retrospectively studied the imaging data of 49 consecutive adult patients (31 males, 18 females) who underwent a computed tomographic (CT) angiogram for suspected vascular conditions unrelated to the craniovertebral junction. Several parameters related to the atlanto-dental relationship, foramen magnum, atlas and axis vertebrae were recorded, including the dimensions of the commonly instrumented bony regions and also the indices related to the CVJ bony relationships. The data was also compared between the two genders, statistically through the Student's t-test using the statistical program \"R\". No patient had an atlanto dens interval >2.5 mm. The mean distance of the odontoid tip from the McRae line in this series was 5.11 mm and no patient had the odontoid tip above the McRae line. Female subjects had significantly smaller diameters of C1 lateral masses and odontoid screw trajectory length when compared to males. Additionally, in the Indian population, the length range of odontoid screw trajectory and the thickness of the narrowest part of the C2 pedicles was smaller with respect to similar data from other geographical regions. However, the rest of the parameters resembled the data from studies conducted on populations\n\nPopulation Stratification and Underrepresentation of Indian Subcontinent Genetic Diversity in the 1000 Genomes Project Dataset.\n\nPubMed\n\nSengupta, Dhriti; Choudhury, Ananyo; Basu, Analabha; Ramsay, MichÃ¨le\n\n2016-12-31\n\nGenomic variation in Indian populations is of great interest due to the diversity of ancestral components, social stratification, endogamy and complex admixture patterns. With an expanding population of 1.2 billion, India is also a treasure trove to catalogue innocuous as well as clinically relevant rare mutations. Recent studies have revealed four dominant ancestries in populations from mainland India: Ancestral North-Indian (ANI), Ancestral South-Indian (ASI), Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB) and Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA). The 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) Phase-3 data include about 500 genomes from five linguistically defined Indian-Subcontinent (IS) populations (Punjabi, Gujrati, Bengali, Telugu and Tamil) some of whom are recent migrants to USA or UK. Comparative analyses show that despite the distinct geographic origins of the KGP-IS populations, the ANI component is predominantly represented in this dataset. Previous studies demonstrated population substructure in the HapMap Gujrati population, and we found evidence for additional substructure in the Punjabi and Telugu populations. These substructured populations have characteristic/significant differences in heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficients. Moreover, we demonstrate that the substructure is better explained by factors like differences in proportion of ancestral components, and endogamy driven social structure rather than invoking a novel ancestral component to explain it. Therefore, using language and/or geography as a proxy for an ethnic unit is inadequate for many of the IS populations. This highlights the necessity for more nuanced sampling strategies or corrective statistical approaches, particularly for biomedical and population genetics research in India. Â© The Author(s) 2016.

Possible implications of such trait differences on cross-cultural behavioral response to alcohol drinking are discussed.

Taurodontism also provides a valuable clue in detecting its association with various syndromes and other systemic conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Taurodont molars among a North Indian population. A total of 1000 patients' full-mouth periapical radiographs were screened. The radiographs were evaluated under optimal conditions using double magnifying glasses. A total of 7615 molars (including third molars) were evaluated. The relative incidence and the correlations regarding the location of Taurodont teeth (right versus left side and maxillary versus mandibular) were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Twenty-eight patients were found to have a Taurodont molar (11 women and 17 men [P = 0.250]). The prevalence of Taurodont molar was 2.8%. Males had a higher prevalence rate than females (3.4% vs. 2.2%, respectively). A cluster analysis of total Taurodonts in the mandible (45%) versus maxilla (55%) of both males and females combined showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The occurrence of Taurodontism is basically based on racial expression in different populations. These variations in prevalence between different populations may be due to ethnic variations. The occurrence of Taurodont molars among this Indian population was rare.\n\nOverweight and obesity: overrepresentation in the pediatric reconstructive burn population.\n\nPubMed\n\nMayes, Theresa; Gottschlich, Michele M; Allgeier, Chris; Khoury, Jane; Kagan, Richard J\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPediatric burn patients are predisposed to excessive weight gain in the reconstructive period, but the cause is unclear. An overweight (OW) or obese (OB) condition is associated with numerous health risks, decreased physical function, and increased morbidity. The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of OW status in reconstructive, pediatric burn patients with the prevalence in the US population. The authors reviewed the records of 1533 pediatric patients, >1 year from acute burn, admitted for an elective reconstructive procedure. Body mass index between 85th and 95th percentile, according to the National Center for Health Statistics for 2000 growth charts, was classified as OW, and body mass index >95th percentile was classified as OB. Frequency of OW and OB and racial disparity was calculated as a percentage of total patients and compared with pediatric data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 1999 to 2006, a nationally representative sample. The rate of OW and OB was 16.3 and 24.1%, respectively, in the authors' pediatric burn population. White patients had OW and OB rates of 15.9 and 23.6%, respectively, compared with 18.2 and 30.2%, respectively, in black patients. All OW and OB rates were outside the 95% confidence interval of the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey population. The rates of OW and OB in pediatric reconstructive burn patients exceed the US population standard across age and race stratifications. The prevention and treatment of excessive weight gain should be a component of rehabilitation in pediatric burns.\n\nExtensive Copy Number Variations in Admixed Indian Population of African Ancestry: Potential Involvement in Adaptation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDash, Debasis; Mukerji, Mitali\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAdmixture mapping has been enormously resourceful in identifying genetic variations linked to phenotypes, adaptation, and diseases. In this study through analysis of copy number variable regions (CNVRs), we report extensive restructuring in the genomes of the recently admixed African-Indian population (OG-W-IP) that inhabits a highly saline environment in Western India. The study included subjects from OG-W-IP (OG), five different Indian and three HapMap populations that were genotyped using Affymetrix version 6.0 arrays. Copy number variations (CNVs) detected using Birdsuite were used to define CNVRs. Population structure with respect to CNVRs was delineated using random forest approach. OG genomes have a surprising excess of CNVs in comparison to other studied populations. Individual ancestry proportions computed using STRUCTURE also reveals a unique genetic component in OGs. Population structure analysis with CNV genotypes indicates OG to be distant from both the African and Indian ancestral populations. Interestingly, it shows genetic proximity with respect to CNVs to only one Indian population IE-W-LP4, which also happens to reside in the same geographical region. We also observe a significant enrichment of molecular processes related to ion binding and receptor activity in genes encompassing OG-specific CNVRs. Our results suggest that retention of CNVRs from ancestral natives and de novo acquisition of CNVRs could accelerate the process of adaptation especially in an extreme environment. Additionally, this population would be enormously useful for dissecting genes and delineating the involvement of CNVs in salt adaptation.

We performed a replication study of variants rs998451 and rs6723108 of gene TMEM163 and rs7607980 of gene COBLL1. The variations were genotyped using Taqman allele discrimination assay in 1209 Northwest Indians (651 T2D cases and 558 controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression. All the three SNPs examined in this study did not show any significant association with T2D. For rs998451 and rs6723108 of TMEM163 the observed odds ratios were 0.71 with a 95% CI of 0.28-1.84 (p=0.484) and 1.80 with a 95% CI of 0.74-4.40 (p=0.196), respectively. For rs7607980 the estimated odds ratio was 1.01 with 95% CI of 0.70-1.44 (p=0.946). We conclude that lack of association could be because of population structure of Indian Population that is conglomeration of various ethnic groups. For a conclusive association study of T2D in India, it is critical that such studies are carried out among endogamous ethnic groups rather than conventional practice of pooling samples based on Geographical/regional or linguist affiliations like Asian Indian, North or South Indian etc. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The nine STR loci were profiled on 902 individuals using fluorescent detection methods on an ABI377 System, with the aid of an Amp-F1 Profiler Plus Kit. The studied populations include two upper castes, Brahmin and Kayastha; a tribe, Garo, from West Bengal; a Hindu caste, Meitei, with historical links to Bengal Brahmins; a migrant group of Muslims; three tribal groups, Naga, Kuki and Hmar, from Manipur in northeast India; and a middle-ranking caste, Golla, who are seminomadic herders from Andhra Pradesh. Gene diversity analysis suggests that the average heterozygosity is uniformly high (>0.8) in the studied populations, with the coefficient of gene differentiation at 0.050 +/- 0.0054. Both neighbor-joining (NJ) and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) trees based on DA distances bring out distinct clusters that are consistent with ethnic, linguistic, and/or geographic backgrounds of the populations. The fit of the Harpending and Ward model of regression of average heterozygosity on the gene frequency centroid is found to be good, and the observed outliers are consistent with the population structure and history of the studied populations. Our study suggests that the nine STR loci, used so far mostly for forensic investigations, can be used fruitfully for microevolutionary studies as well, and for reconstructing the phylogenetic history of human populations, at least at the local level.\n\nEfficacy of \"Dimodent\" sex predictive equation assessed in an Indian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nBharti, A; Angadi, P V; Kale, A D; Hallikerimath, S R\n\n2011-07-01\n\nTeeth are considered as a useful adjunct for sex assessment and may play an important role in constructing a post-mortem profile. The Dimodent method is based on the high degree of sex discrimination obtained with the mandibular canine and the high correlation coefficients between mandibular canine and lateral incisor mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) dimensions. This has been evaluated in the French and Lebanese, but no study exists on its efficacy in Indians. Here, we have applied the 'Dimodent' equation on an Indian sample (100 males, 100 females; age range of 19-27yrs). Additionally, a population-specific Dimodent equation was derived using logistic regression analysis and applied to our sample. Also, the sex determination potential of MD and BL measurements of mandibular lateral incisors and canines, individually, was assessed. We found a poor sex assessment accuracy using the Dimodent equation of Fronty (34.5%) in our Indian sample, but the populationspecific Dimodent equation gave a better accuracy (72%).Thus, it appears that sexual dimorphism in teeth is population-specific; consequently the Dimodent equation has to be derived individually in different populations for use in sex assessment. The mesiodistal measurement of the mandibular canine alone gave a marginally higher accuracy (72.5%); therefore, we suggest the use of mandibular canines alone rather than the Dimodent method.\n\nExtensive copy number variations in admixed Indian population of African ancestry: potential involvement in adaptation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNarang, Ankita; Jha, Pankaj; Kumar, Dhirendra; Kutum, Rintu; Mondal, Anupam Kumar; Dash, Debasis; Mukerji, Mitali\n\n2014-11-13\n\nAdmixture mapping has been enormously resourceful in identifying genetic variations linked to phenotypes, adaptation, and diseases.

This framework employs physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modeling in conjunction with numerical \"inversion\" techniques. To quantify the value of different types of exposure data \"accompanying\" biomarker data, a study was conducted focusing on reconstructing exposures to chlorpyrifos, from measurements of its metabolite levels in urine. The study employed biomarker data as well as supporting exposure-related information from the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS), Maryland, while the MENTOR-3P system (Modeling ENvironment for TOtal Risk with Physiologically based Pharmacokinetic modeling for Populations) was used for PBTK modeling. Recently proposed, simple numerical reconstruction methods were applied in this study, in conjunction with PBTK models. Two types of reconstructions were studied using (a) just the available biomarker and supporting exposure data and (b) synthetic data developed via augmenting available observations. Reconstruction using only available data resulted in a wide range of variation in estimated exposures. Reconstruction using synthetic data facilitated evaluation of numerical inversion methods and characterization of the value of additional information, such as study-specific data that can be collected in conjunction with the biomarker data. Although the NHEXAS data set provides a significant amount of supporting exposure-related information, especially when compared to national studies such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this information is still not adequate for detailed reconstruction of exposures under several conditions, as demonstrated here. The analysis presented here provides a starting point for introducing improved designs for future\n\nImpact of classical risk factors of type 2 diabetes among Asian Indian, Chinese and Japanese populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, L; Tuomilehto, J; Qiao, Q; SÃ¶derberg, S; Daimon, M; Chambers, J; PitkÃ¤niemi, J\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThis review investigated the population impact of major modifiable type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk factors, with special focus on native Asian Indians, to estimate population attributable risks (PARs) and compare them with estimates from Chinese and Japanese populations. Information was obtained on risk factors in 21,041 Asian Indian, 17,774 Chinese and 17,986 Japanese populations from multiple, large, cross-sectional studies (the DECODA project) of T2D. Crude and adjusted PARs were estimated for the major T2D risk factors. Age had the highest crude and adjusted PARs among Asian Indians and Chinese in contrast to waist-hip ratio among Japanese. After adjusting for age, the PAR for body mass index (BMI) in Asian Indians (41.4% [95% CI: 37.2%; 45.4%]) was second only to triglycerides (46.4% [95% CI: 39.5%; 52.8%]) compared with 35.8% [95% CI: 29.9%; 41.4%] in Japanese and 38.4% [95% CI: 33.5%; 43.2%] in Chinese people. The PAR for BMI adjusted for age, LDL and triglycerides (39.7% [95% CI: 31.6%; 47.2%]) was higher than for any other factor in Asian Indians, and was much higher than in the Chinese (16.8% [95% CI: 3.0%; 30.9%]) and Japanese (30.4% [95% CI: 17.5%; 42.2%]) populations. This review provides estimates of the association between major risk factors and prevalences of T2D among Asian populations by examining their PARs from large population-based samples. From a public-health point of view, the importance of BMI in Asian Indians is especially highlighted in comparison to the other Asian populations. Given these results and other recent findings on the causality link between BMI and T2D, it can be postulated that obesity may be involved in the aetiology of T2D through interaction with ethnic-specific genetic factors, although ethnicity itself is not a direct risk factor for T2D as people of all ethnic backgrounds develop diabetes.

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of dental anomalies in the Indian population. A retrospective study of 4133 panoramic radiographs of patients, who attended the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital between September 2008 to December 2012 was done. The ages of the patients ranged from 13 to 38 years with a mean age of 21.8 years. The orthopantomographs (OPGs) and dental records were examined for any unusual finding such as congenitally missing teeth, impactions, ectopic eruption, supernumerary teeth, odontoma, dilacerations, taurodontism, dens in dente, germination and fusion, among others. 1519 (36.7%) patients had at least one dental anomaly. The congenitally missing teeth 673 (16.3%) had the highest prevalence, followed by impacted teeth 641 (15.5%), supernumerary teeth 51 (1.2%) and microdontia 41 (1.0%). Other anomalies were found at lower prevalence ranging from transposition 7 (0.1%) to ectopic eruption 30 (0.7%). The most prevalent anomaly in the Indian population was congenitally missing teeth (16.3%), and the second frequent anomaly was impacted teeth (15.5%), whereas, macrodontia, odontoma and transposition were the least frequent anomalies, with a prevalence of 0.2%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. While the overall prevalence of these anomalies may be low, the early diagnosis is imperative for the patient management and treatment planning. Key words:Dental anomaly, prevalence, panoramic radiography.\n\nMolecular analysis of the human faecal archaea in a southern Indian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nRani, Sandya B; Balamurugan, Ramadass; Ramakrishna, Balakrishnan S\n\n2017-03-01\n\nArchaea are an important constituent of the human gut microbiota, but there is no information on human gut archaea in an Indian population. In this study, faecal samples were obtained from different age groups (neonatal babies, preschool children, school-going children, adolescents, adults and elderly) of a southern Indian population, and from a tribal population also resident in southern India). 16S rRNA gene sequences specific to Archaea were amplified from pooled faecal DNA in each group, sequenced, and aligned against the NCBI database. Of the 806 adequate sequences in the study, most aligned with 22 known sequences. There were 9 novel sequences in the present study. All sequences were deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database with the following accession numbers: KF607113 - KF607918. Methanobrevibacter was the most prevalent genus among all the age groups accounting for 98% in neonates, 96% in post-weaning, and 100% each in preschool, school and adult population. In the elderly, Methanobrevibacter accounted for 96% and in tribal adults, 99% of the clones belonged to Methanobrevibacter genus. Other genera detected included Caldisphaera, Halobaculum, Methanosphaeraand Thermogymnomonas. Methanobrevibacter smithii predominated in all age groups, accounting for 749 (92.9%) of the 806 sequences. Archaea can be found in the faeces of southern Indian residents immediately after birth. Methanobrevibacter smithii was the dominant faecal archeon in all age groups, with other genera being found at the extremes of age.\n\nNon-transference of biological reference interval of TSH by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay: an Indian population perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarkar, Rajarshi\n\n2013-08-23\n\nAlthough TSH measurement by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay has become commonplace in India, significant discrepancy has been observed on interpretation of the test results when the manufacturer supplied biological reference interval (BRI) criteria were applied. This report determined whether the manufacturer's BRI (Roche Cobas) is transferable to the Indian population. Three hundred seventy-eight age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were selected from an urban Indian population. TSH reference measurements were acquired, and the reference data were statistically analysed. BRI of the Indian urban reference population was determined by non-parametric means. BRI was found to be 1.134 to 7.280Î¼IU/ml. BRI thus calculated was found to be significantly different from that mentioned by the manufacturer (0.27 to 4.20Î¼IU/ml), which, needless to mention, has profound clinical implications in this part of the globe.

To draw an appropriate inference regarding the trends of a particular type of cancer in a country, it is imperative to glance at the reliable data collected by Population Based Cancer Registries over a period of time. To give an insight of changing trends of breast cancer which have taken place over a period of time among women in Cancer Registries of India. Breast Cancer trends for invasive breast cancer in women in Indian Registries have varied during the selected period. Occurrence of breast cancers has also shown geographical variation in India. This data was collected by means of a 'Standard Core Proforma' designed by NCRP conforming to the data fields as suggested by International norms. The Proforma was filled by trained Registry workers based on interview/ hospital medical records/ supplementing data by inputs from treating surgeons/radiation oncologists/involved physicians/pathologists. The contents of the Proforma are entered into specifically created software and transmitted electronically to the coordinating center at Bangalore. The registries contributing to more number of years of data are called as older registries, while other recently established registries are called newer registries. While there has been an increase recorded in breast cancer in most of the registries, some of them have recorded an insignificant increase. Comparison of Age Adjusted Rates (AARs) among Indian Registries has been carried out after which trends observed in populations covered by Indian Registries are depicted.
