They have become an integral part of my day-to-day life and any moment that is not shared with them feels incomplete. This year was no exception and we all had a great time together. They brought in multiple cakes and we must've spent around 20 minutes just cutting them all.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old actor, who is known for his TV shows such as 'Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai', 'Sajan Re Jhoot Mat Bolo', 'Badi Doooor Se Aaye Hai', among others shared that the entire day was full of fun and he had more plans to celebrate the day with his family and friends.\n\n\"All in all, it was a day well spent and a big thank you to the cast, crew and fans for showing us so much love. Thank you to everyone who made my day special,\" he added.\n\nDisclaimer: This story has not been edited by the Sakshi Post team and is auto-generated from syndicated feed."
