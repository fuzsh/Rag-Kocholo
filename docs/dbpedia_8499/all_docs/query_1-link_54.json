        "text": "This article describes and explains “police vigilantism” as a mode of authoritative extra-legal coercion performed by public police officials conceived as doing their duty to realize justice in the world. Based on ethnographic observations, interviews and content analysis of news and entertainment media as well as official government reports, this essay examines a specific form of police vigilantism in contemporary India known as encounter killings. Demonstrating that encounter killings are widely constituted as a form of ritual purification and social defense by self-sacrificing police, it theorizes a metaphysics of police vigilantism in India that combines generalized experiences of insecurity with shared cosmologies of just war. Comparing this metaphysics with justified state violence in other global south contexts, this study sheds light on how such violence may be legitimated through a conceptual inextricability of law and war as embodied in uniquely a constituted human figure: the police vigilante.\n\nPolice force is regarded as one of the most important internal security forces given a mission to monitor law and order situation in the country and curb any sort of violent or criminal activities. The term \"Police Violence\" it-self sounds awkward and contradictory, but it refers to a situation where allegedly this law enforcing agency is involved in violating rights of the public and is involved in some sort of misuse or over use of its powers, hence troubling the general public in one way or the other. This qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews with different stakeholders (including the Police force it-self) identified by the researchers and tries to integrate their responses and explore different forms of such alleged violence and importantly investigate potential circumstances where this over use of power is justified or is given protection. Different stakeholders have different opinion on the subject under study.\n\nThis article focuses on legal learning and a specific type of protest that emerged in the aftermath of the police shoot-out at Batla House, New Delhi in 2008. Following the shooting, there was an atmosphere of fear in the locality, as doubts began to emerge about the police’s version of the story. What exacerbated the situation was a series of arrests from the locality, often without proper documents and procedures. Under the pretext of national security, the mandatory legal procedures were often ignored, and severely limited the legal avenues available for the residents. The residents invested in collective learning of the legal procedures and were able to create tactical situations on the street to force the state agencies to follow the letter of the law. In this process, they reproduced the state’s logic of combining the judicial with the extrajudicial but aimed it towards deepening their belonging to the law.\n\nThe present research was conducted to study the complex police culture and perceptions from both the nearby community and the service providing officials and staff. The study locale was the Police station Lohi Bher which was notified in 2012 to be established, before it used to serve as a police picket (chowki). The study was qualitatively designed to reach the respondents with the help of key informants and by conducting both informal and in-depth interviews and focus group discussion(s). A total of 31 respondents were purposively selected to cultivate perceptions and knowledge on the issue(s) of Police department and its existing culture. The study was conducted through multiple visits by the lead researcher and its fellow team members. It was found that existing police culture is a complex whole of politics, economics and other socio-cultural factors which shapes and defines different currents, functioning of the service delivery.\n\n\"The basic tenet of police system in India is that it's a vital arm of government for establishing the stability in the society. The police must play its role according to the law of the land and perform its duty impartial and independent manner without any biases and prejudices to anybody. But the ground realities tell a different story as there is a rampant of criminality 2 in the police system. The whole police system has been facing trust-deficit crisis as civil society treats them as foe instead of friend. The Indian Police deeply involved in corruption and partisan politics and behave highly unprofessionalism. The police is not a master of the society but the servant and its biggest accountability is towards the public at large. The policing in India have always been a controversial issue due to various factors including human rights violation and numerous instances of custodial violence i.e. how police treat suspects, custodial murder, inhuman custodial torture, their biases and prejudices against a particular community. Its matter of fact that many innocent youths have been killed in fake encounters and most of them belongs to a particular minority community. The chief reason of rampant criminality among police is that its non-accountability and unanswerable attitude towards the society and the reason being is there is no law which can prosecute errant police officials. When it comes to extrajudicial killings it is worst as their targets are mainly from the minority community especially the Muslims. 3 There have been many conclusive studies that suggest police have played highly partisan role while tackling terrorism or performing duty to ensure law and order in the society. The finding of Justice Nanavati Commission Report of 1984, Justice Srikrishna Commission Report and National Police Commission Report are some instances. The main thirst of the present paper is to examine the pattern of police criminality and activism of Indian judicial system.\n\nThe debate about policing in India usually focuses on the lack of accountability and professionalization of the organization. Writing a book on this topic is most popular with former high-ranking police officers. Analyzing the law of the land almost 70 years after Independence and looking into police powers themselves is, by contrast, much less popular in academic writing and the legal profession. A popular and widespread opinion is that it does not make any sense to analyze shortcomings in statutory law because India is a common law country and the Indian police do not obey the law anyway. At the same time, it is objected that granting the police a set of clearly stated but also delimited statutory powers would automatically lead to even more powers for the police. Obviously, it has to be conceded that any revision and modernization of statutory powers, e.g. in Police Acts and the Code of Criminal Procedure, implies the risk of an expansion of police powers detrimental to fundament...\n\nIt is a popular truism that police in India generally lack legitimate authority and public trust. This lack is widely understood by scholars, policy analysts, and practitioners as being rooted in the institution’s colonial development as a means of oppression, and its alleged corruption and criminalization in the postcolonial period. The social facts of situational hyper-empowerment and widespread decadence of police do much to explain their poor image and performance; but these explanations do not account for the fact that police in India are also structurally disempowered by cultural-political and legal-institutional claims to multiple and conflicting forms of authority that challenge and often overwhelm the authority of police. This structural disempowerment and its performances in everyday interactions between the police and the public constitute an ongoing social process of delegitimation of police authority in contemporary India. Following ethnographic analysis of this process of delegitimation, I explore the implications of focusing on police disempowerment for theorizations of the sources and capabilities of state legal authority more generally."
