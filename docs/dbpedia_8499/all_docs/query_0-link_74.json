        "text": "New Delhi, June 21 (UNI) The Wagle family, along with entertaining the audience, has also been instrumental in spreading awareness about various social issues.\n\nKeeping true to their nature, the Wagle family is back again, this time tackling yet another pertinent issue, the social demon of female foeticide and infanticide. We see Champa Mausi, Vandana’s auntand her daughter-in-law Kirti arriving at the Wagle residence from their hometown for Champa Mausi’s cataract operation, at least that’s what she says.\n\nThe truth is Kirti is pregnant and it is suspected that she is carrying a girl. Champa Mausi and her family are disappointed about this and have brought Kirti in town for abortion. Meanwhile Kirti is doing her best to prevent her unborn child’s fatality.\n\nVandana (Pariva Pranati) and Rajesh (Sumeet Raghavan) discover the truth and Vandana is horrified that her mausi, the woman she looked up to as mother figure, is about to commit the horrifying crime of female foeticide. Vandana and Rajesh, as parents of a daughter, decide to fight for the life of the innocent child in Kirti’s womb and join hands with Kirti in teaching Champa Mausi a lesson that ending an innocent and defenseless life is the worst thing a person can do.\n\nIn their typical Wagle style, Vandana and Rajesh, set out to explaining to Champa Mausi that having a daughter is not a curse but a blessing to the family.\n\nWill they be successful in changing Champa Mausi’s views? Will Kirti and the Wagle clan be able to save Kirti’s unborn child are some of the questions viewers will see getting answered in the coming days.\n\nThe Wagle family has always done things differently. Their steadfast belief in the well being of humankind, equality for all, their focus on family values and providing a voice to those who don’t have one has always guided them in tackling difficult issues.\n\nThe series has always taken a forefront in addressing important issues and social evils, while at the same time ensuring to entertain audiences while delivering important messages. It is this brand of familial humour and heart that continues to make the show a fan favourite.\n\nSumeet Raghavan who plays Rajesh Wagle said,\"As a father of a girl, This is a topic close to my heart. My kid is the light of my life, and I can't imagine my life without her. Having a daughter is a blessing, and I'm not sure why people make up rubbish about them being a burden. No! Daughters are not a burden. They’re a family’s pride! There’s nothing daughters cannot achieve. .- A daughter’s love is like no other. She is the one who becomes your support when you need her, on whom you can rely on, can depend on. Daughters can do everything sons can. So why the discrimination? I hope that through our show, we make people realise that having a daughter is something to be proud of.\"\n\nPariva Pranati who portrays Vandana Wagle commented,”It breaks my heart as a woman to see how some people see having a daughter as a bad thing. It’s even sadder to see some mothers themselves frowning upon the news of a daughter being born. We daughters are far more capable than what society believes us to be. I consider myself fortunate to be a woman who had parents who not only let me be born but gave me the world to help me become who I am today.”\n\n“Killing unborn or newborn born girls because they’re a burden is heinous. Women are more than capable of standing on their own two feet and caring for the entire family if the need arises. Just give your daughter a chance and see her conquer the world. Through our show, I wish to make people appreciate the significance of a daughter,” she added.\n\nWatch ‘Wagle Ki Duniya’ at 0900 pm on Sony Sab.\n\nUNI PY GNK"
