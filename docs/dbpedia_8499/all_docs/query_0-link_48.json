        "text": "During the raging second wave of pandemic makers of many tv shows decided to shift their base to different cities because of the shooting restrictions laid by the Maharashtra government. As the things are returning back to normal the makers are thinking about returning back to Mumbai.\n\nThe popular comedy show Wagle Ki Duniya shifted its base to Silvassa during the lockdown in Mumbai. The team has been shooting there for almost a month and a half now. Now that rules in Maharashtra are relaxed a bit in Mumbai, the makers of the show are thinking about shifting their base back to Mumbai soon. Sumeet Raghavan talked about it in an interview with ETimes TV, he said, “We are about to return to Mumbai but let’s see what the situation is. We are yet to see what are the protocols, SOPs, and then we will decide. It is very difficult to shoot in the allotted time that has been approved by the state Govt. In television, you are bound to take 12 hrs to shoot. So let’s see. We are eager to come back to Mumbai. It has been more than 52 days we have been shooting in Silvassa.”\n\nTalking about the protocol they follow there, he said, “We have been very strict as per the bio-bubble is concerned. JD Majethia Sir is also with us here. He is working on the script, keeping an eye on the shoot, and taking care of us as well. We are not even getting pictures clicked with our fans and no outsiders are being allowed in the resort.”\n\nWhile according to government regulation, shoots will be allowed to take place between 7 am to 5 pm in a bio-bubble. The producers are suggested that they would need a full shift of 12 hours to meet the demands and deadlines."
