        "text": "Indian director, actor, producer, and producer-director Ajay Devgan. In 1991, when his debut film was released, he received praise for his acting from audiences across the nation. Additionally, he performs all of the lethal feats without the aid of a body double. Ajay has since acted in a number of films that have elevated him to the status of a Bollywood movie superstar. He is currently among the best-paid actors in the nation. In the year 2000, he founded Ajay Devgan Films Productions, a production firm. Together with his wife Kajol, he directed his first film, U Me Aur Hum, in 2008. Two National Film Awards for Best Actor went to Ajay Devgan for the films Zakhm and The Legend of Bhagat Singh. Let’s Revisit Some Vesritile Performances given by Ajay Devgn.\n\nPhool Aur Kaante (1991)\n\nDue to the debut of numerous other actors with the name Vishal at the same time, including Manoj Kumar's son, Devgn changed his stage name from his birth name, Vishal, to Ajay when he entered the film industry in 1991. He started his professional career with Phool Aur Kaante and won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He appeared alongside Madhu. Devgn split when perched between two motorcycles in his initial scene.\n\nIndian action-romance film Phool Aur Kaante, also known as Flowers and Thorns, was produced and directed by Kuku Kohli in 1991. Ajay Devgan, Madhoo, Aruna Irani, Jagdeep, and Amrish Puri are among the actors who appear in it. Devgan, the son of the late stunt and action choreographer Veeru Devgan, and Madhoo, the niece of Hema Malini, made their acting debuts in the movie. The movie was a smash hit, earning Devgan the 1991 Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. The Telugu version of this movie is called Varasudu. The movie is mainly inspired by the Sibi Malayil-directed Malayalam film Parampara, in which Mammootty portrays both Johnny, the lead character, and Lawrence, his father.\n\nHum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999)\n\nIn the 1999 romance drama Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devgn played Vanraj, a guy who tries to assist his wife (Aishwarya Rai) in getting back together with her boyfriend (Salman Khan). A crucial turning point in Devgan's career was Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai co-starred in the movie, which was directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and was based on the Bengali novel Na Hanyate by Maitreyi Devi.\n\nDevgn's performance received significant appreciation. He is looking for the boy there who is dating the girl he is secretly in love with. But he excels in intense sequences, and he does well here. He excels in the scene as he struggles to maintain his composure while growing frustrated with his wife's intransigence. As a result of the film's popularity, Devgan received a nomination for the Filmfare best actor prize.\n\nThe Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002)\n\nIn the biopic The Legend of Bhagat Singh directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, he portrayed Bhagat Singh. The reviews of his performance were favorable. The movie was released on June 7, 2002, and went on to win two National Film Honors, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, and three Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. Taran Adarsh stated of Ajay Devgn, To suggest that he has lived the part, would be an understatement. His performance is likely to garner adulation from cine-goers while fetching awards.\n\nRajkumar Santoshi is the director of the 2002 Hindi-language biographical period drama The Legend of Bhagat Singh. The movie is about Bhagat Singh, a freedom fighter who, along with other members of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, battled for the independence of India. The movie follows Singh's life from his early years, when he sees the Jallianwala Bagh slaughter, to the day of his execution on 23 March 1931—his hanging day.\n\nGolmaal: Fun Unlimited (2006)\n\nGolmaal: Fun Unlimited, sometimes known as Chaos: Fun Unlimited, is a 2006 Indian comedy film in the Hindi language that was produced by Dhilin Mehta and Parag Sanghvi under the banner of K Sera Sera Private Limited and directed by Rohit Shetty.

Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara, a sequel! , which came out in 2013.\n\nThe reviews for the movie and Devgn's performance were favorable. Ajay Devgn is wonderful as Sultan, stated Taran Adarsh. Although the actor played a character quite similar to this in Company, it must be acknowledged that his performance in Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai is very different. He gives the character a tonne of depth, demonstrating his breadth and adaptability. Without a doubt, this is Ajay's best effort to date. Ajay Devgn is outstanding in the character of Sultan Mirza, according to Komal Nahta. His portrayal is so genuine that it seems as though he was destined for this part. Everything about him is amazing, from his appearance to the way he acts and delivers lines of conversation. A truly honorable performance!\n\nSingham Returns (2014)\n\nDevgn appeared in the Singham Returns sequel directed by Rohit Shetty in 2014. Indian critics gave Singham Returns a mixed bag of reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it four stars and said: The film is a complete mass entertainer with power-packed drama, hi-intensity dialogue, and towering performances as its aces.
