        "text": "Today at Knowledge, our CEO Bill McDermott shared a big, bold vision for ServiceNow. As AI continues to rapidly change the world, we are helping our customers, our partners and our community put AI to work for people. As part of this exciting next phase, we are introducing our first ever brand ambassador ‚Äì a man who needs no introduction: Idris Elba. Idris is the perfect ambassador for us and here's why: üî• He is known first and foremost as a brilliant actor, but he actually does much, much more. üí™üèΩ He is CEO of multiple businesses, he‚Äôs a community leader and a world class kickboxer. üéß He even DJ-ed a Royal Wedding. Talk about one person who can do it all. Just like our platform. I've been very fortunate to get to know him a bit through this process (sorry for the annoying faux-humble flex;) but I can tell you he truly wants to make the world work better, which is one of many reasons he hit it off with Bill. Idris is developing a new smart city on Sherbro Island off the coast of Sierra Leone--the birthplace of his father and we are going to do everything we can to help him with his vision. Idris is also a truly humble guy which is extra refreshing considering how darn good he is at so many things. He's going to help us get the word out about all the ways organizations can put AI to work for their people. To make their work better. To make their lives better. Check out the campaign we announced today at Knowledge. We hope you love it as much as we do. #PutAIToWork #Know24\n\nEmbracing New Opportunities: The Power of a Fresh Start üåÖü¶ã Good morning and happy Monday! As we begin a new week, it's a perfect time to embrace new opportunities and set the tone for the days ahead. Here‚Äôs a thought to kickstart your week: Innovation Begins with Curiosity: Just as a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, our growth and innovation come from exploring new possibilities. This weekend, a monarch butterfly my kids had been nurturing in its chrysalis emerged, and we released it into our pollinator garden. Watching this transformation reminded me of the beauty and power of curiosity and growth. Practical Steps to Cultivate Curiosity: Ask Questions: Never hesitate to ask why something works the way it does. Curiosity leads to deeper understanding and better solutions. ‚ùìüí° Explore New Tools: Take some time to explore new tools or features in your field. For ServiceNow professionals, this could mean experimenting with a new module or script. üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ Connect with Peers: Engage with your network. Discussions with peers can spark new ideas and provide different perspectives. ü§ùüåê Stay Open-Minded: Be open to new ideas and approaches. Innovation often comes from thinking outside the box and challenging the status quo. üîÑüß† Just like the butterfly‚Äôs transformation, our own growth is a journey of curiosity and exploration. As I start this week and continue my growth within the NextGen ServiceNow cohort, I am committed to being curious and open to new possibilities What new thing are you curious about this week? #MondayMotivation #Curiosity #Innovation #ServiceNow #ProfessionalDevelopment #TechTraining #GrowthMindset #ButterflyEffect #Transformation #NextGen\n\nTransformative Collaboration at EY wavespace Munich: Unleashing the Potential of GenAI in HR A day in our EY wavespace Munich marked by a surge of inspiration and collaborative energy, where we explored the vast possibilities of General AI (GenAI) in revolutionizing Human Resources. I'm deeply grateful for the rich exchange of perspectives with our diverse group of participants, hailing from various industries, all united in their quest for innovation. The discussions underscored the importance of user-centric approaches, swift innovation, and agile practices in today's fast-paced business landscape. A heartfelt thank you to Martin, Benjamin and S√∂ren for igniting our imaginations with practical insights into GenAI applications. Their presentation on use-cases, bolstered by real-life examples, provided a tangible vision of what's possible when technology meets human ingenuity. I also want to extend my appreciation to Barbara, Max and Tobias for their invaluable contributions. Their shared experiences and wisdom shed light on the transformative journey of integrating GenAI into HR processes. The collective innovative spirit in the room was truly invigorating. It's clear that when we come together in spaces designed to foster creativity and co-creation, like EY wavespace, there's no limit to what we can achieve. As we continue to navigate the exciting realm of GenAI, I look forward to further collaborations that push the boundaries of what we can accomplish in HR and beyond. A special thanks to my colleagues Nelson and Anne not only for their inspiring impulses on HR Transformation but fostering a network of innovators to accelerate transformation within HR. Thanks to Benedikt, I enjoyed running this session with you #EYwavespace #GenAI #HRInnovation #Collaboration #ServiceNow #UserCentricity #AgileInnovation\n\nReaching the base camp is an achievement, but navigating the path from base camp to the peak requires a different set of skills. This journey demands continual learning, relearning, adapting, and maintaining a strong presence. To truly be felt and heard - what we call - Executive Presence - is essential. And this goes beyond mere confidence and encompassing Gravitas: The way you act, carrying yourself with authority and poise. Authenticity: Projecting your true self through effective and genuine communication Appearance: Dressing in a manner that reflects professionalism and respect. The LEAP (Leadership Empowerment for Accelerated Progress) program at ServiceNow exemplified its intent to (re) create future leaders. The meticulous planning and dedication of the delivery team, led by Kamla Mulla, Sai Prasad, Sulekha Kapadan ensured seamless facilitation. For me, the participants' curiosity and eagerness to learn were truly invigorating and kept me on my toes. Thank You so Much team Service Now..ilango AP (he/him/his),Rajendra Palorkar,Varun Jayanti. # LEAP #Service Now#Leadership\n\n**ALT // SHIFT // LIFE** It's no secret I love my job and the company I work for, ServiceNow. There's a lot of content on LinkedIn, so you'd be forgiven for scrolling past my post. But if you get a minute in your busy day, check out the trailer from our latest film - \"Alt Shift Life,\" directed by Academy Award¬Æ nominee Laura Checkoway. This film highlights three inspiring individuals who rose up with ServiceNow to achieve their dreams: üîπ **Scott (Nashville, TN)**: From a small town to tech success, Scott transformed his life with ServiceNow, now empowering others. üîπ **Sai Varsha (Bangalore, India)**: From a small town to a tech career in Bangalore, Sai‚Äôs journey shows the power of opportunity and innovation. üîπ **DeVonn (Jersey City, NJ)**: From a tough background to a fulfilling career, DeVonn found his path with ServiceNow‚Äôs RiseUp program. These stories are about more than careers - they embody ServiceNow‚Äôs spirit of community and transformation. If you're tech-curious or know someone who wants to break into tech, check out RiseUp with ServiceNow.

Earlier today, we came together for an #EYwavespace Experience and began to co-create a future multi-client wavespace event aimed to help our clients uncover how they may leverage #GenAI to fuel their transformative shifts in #GBS. We discussed the value, know-how and the use cases we each bring to the table and how we may best orchestrate and package it up in a digestable and engaging format for our clients. Having Adrian Ott in this conversation took us to an entirely new level of exploration and asking the right questions when it comes to real-life GenAI application. What truly excites me is not just the destination, but the way we're approaching this; the meta level if you may. Our commitment to collaborative work isn't just reserved for THE day when we welcome the clients into our wavespace; it's rather embedded into every step we take to get there, amplifying our collective creativity and expertise. Thanks to Eric Pretty, Olivia Hambert, Scott Mason, PhD., Adrian Ott, Kaspar Schl√ºer, Julian Ando, Saloni Nirola, Srikant Nayak, Joanna M. Koson, MBA for this very productive morning and I'm very much looking forward to see where this takes us, the insights we'll uncover and the impact we'll create with our clients. Here's to embracing innovation, seizing opportunities, and continuing to pioneer change. üéâ #Eywavespace #ServiceNow #GBS #GenAI #Collaboration"
