Livingston has seen a rebirth to his career since being picked up by the Cavaliers in December.\n\n(Photo by AP)\n\nINDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- Shaun Livingston's season has come full circle.\n\nLivingston will start at point guard in place of the injured Kyrie Irving tonight for the Cavaliers against the Washington Wizards -- the team that cut him just before Cleveland picked him up on Christmas.\n\n\"Victim of circumstances,'' Livingston said with a smile after the team's shootaround this morning. \"It's one of those ironic seasons, I guess. Just another chapter in my crazy book. I'm good with that.''\n\nCoach Byron Scott acknowledged the unusual circumstances, but he figures it's just another example of the dedication that has kept Livingston in the league after a horrific knee injury threatened to end his career in 2007.\n\n\"It's kind of weird,'' Scott said. \"But it's also a blessing, No. 1, that he's back playing and he's healthy and he's playing well. He stuck with it through all the hard times that he's had to face with the surgery and the injury that he had to be able to be back at this point in his career is unbelieveable.\n\n\"It just shows the type of courage and grit and determination that he has as a basketball player. I think coming full circle, going against the team that cut him earlier this season, it should be interested to see how it plays out.''\n\nCasspi practices"
