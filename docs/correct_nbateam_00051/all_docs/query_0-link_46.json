        "text": "It might be an incredible coincidence, but if you leave the Washington Wizards, you might win the NBA championship.\n\nA fact of the matter is that for the past eight seasons, a player from the D.C. based team has won the Larry Oâ€™ Brien trophy. Of course not with that team but with others.\n\nThis trend started back in 2017. Shaun Livingston and Javale McGee were a part of the legendary Golden State Warriors team that has won three titles in four years. Here is the list of all players.\n\nShaun Livingston (GSW 17, 18)\n\nJavale McGee (GSW, 17,18)\n\nJodie Meeks (TOR, 19)\n\nDwight Howard (LAL 20)\n\nJavale McGee (LAL, 20)\n\nMarkieff Morris (LAL, 20)\n\nBobby Portis (MIL, 21)\n\nGary Payton II (GSW, 22)\n\nOtto Porter (GSW, 22)\n\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope (DEN, 23)\n\nJeff Green (DEN, 23)\n\nIsh Smith (DEN, 23)\n\nThomas Bryant (DEN, 23)"
