        "text": "OAKLAND — If Shaun Livingston can dice up the Cavaliers when the “Splash Brothers” are struggling, what does that tell you about this NBA Finals match-up?\n\nIt tells you that the Warriors are better than Cleveland in a lot of ways and maybe even some you hadn”t even contemplated until after Game 1.\n\nIt tells you that Livingston — after struggling through the epic Western Conference finals — is back and that Curry and Thompson were quite happy about that during Thursday”s 104-89 victory at Oracle Arena.\n\nAnd it tells you that there probably worse things are coming for LeBron James and the Cavaliers in this series — probably a lot worse.\n\nBut first, about Livingston, who is deeply respected in the Warriors locker room for his steady countenance and his incredible comeback from a devastating leg injury in 2007.\n\nIf he can come back from almost having his leg amputated, he can make mid-range shots against the shaky Cavaliers defense when the Warriors really need him to.\n\n“He”s got this quiet confidence about him,” Thompson said of Livingston. “He knows how good he is.\n\n“He”s a real pro — with what he”s come back from, that”s probably one of the hardest things any athlete has ever gone through. Real adversity. So when they make a run, that”s nothing to Shaun. He”s an amazing player.”\n\nIt was, as coach Steve Kerr said, a strange game — watching Curry and Thompson miss and miss and miss and at one point they just looked at each other, shook their heads and laughed.\n\nWhat in the world was going on here, in Game 1 of the NBA Finals of all times and places?\n\nBut the “Splash Brothers” could laugh, they could shrug, and they could afford all those emotions because Livingston and the rest of the Warriors bench was winning Game 1.\n\nLivingston finished with 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting and it was his backup unit that pushed the lead in the fourth quarter — precisely when Curry and Thompson were both out of the game.\n\nMaybe this was Livingston coming to life after his wild tomahawk dunk at the climax of Game 7 against Oklahoma City, maybe the Cavaliers are just a better matchup for him.\n\nMaybe it was just time and Livingston knew it.\n\n“It”s all a feel,” Livingston said. “Just being aggressive while we”re out there. (Curry and Thompson) command so much attention, especially Steph off the pick-and-roll.\n\n“So we try to make ourselves available for him and be able to make plays, relieve pressure. Because all it takes is for one shot to go in, we know that. Same for Klay. They get rolling fast.”\n\nCurry and Thompson didn”t get rolling at all in this one, and the Warriors still fended off the Cavaliers relatively easily.\n\nWhat does that say about Game 1 and the rest of this series?\n\nIt means that the Warriors can play much better, it means that Curry and Thompson now feel like they owe their teammates one or two or three …\n\nAnd it means that Game 1 of the Finals didn”t even come close to the intensity that fueled every moment of the Western Conference finals.\n\nA lot of that was symbolized by Livingston looking so comfortable and so aggressive — the Warriors knew he would have an easier time in this series, after the Thunder put so many tall and athletic players on him.\n\n“First of all, he just played a great game — I thought he looked for openings,” Kerr said of Livingston. “He was very aggressive. And you know, this was a strange game for us. We”re not used to having both Steph and Klay off like that with their shooting.”\n\nLivingston had a sluggish series against the Thunder — made only 10 shots total in the seven games.\n\nBut he started making shots on Thursday and he didn”t stop.\n\n“I think I took the same shots last series,” Livingston said, “but it”s just staying confident in my shot, understanding my game, where the shots are going to come from and trusting it.”\n\nLivingston, on his own, had the same number of points as Curry and Thompson, and also single-handedly doubled the point-production of the entire Cleveland bench (which had 10 points).\n\nAt the end, what could Curry and Thompson do but laugh a little? Because they can guess what”s coming in the next few games of this series, and it almost certainly won”t be a combined 8-for-27 shooting.\n\n“It was more a frustrated, shake-it-off kind of laugh,” Thompson said. “We know we”ve still got three to go. We”ve got to go one at a time.\n\n“I don”t know when the last time we shot like that. But that”s fine — when our bench plays like that, controls the ball and plays with great length on the defensive end, we”re tough to beat.”\n\n“Me and Steph, we”ll get it clicking. It”s just a matter of time and staying confident. It”s the NBA Finals, nothing”s going to come easy.”\n\nExcept it looked a lot easier than anything that happened for the Warriors in the last series, even with Thompson and Curry struggling, because Livingston was there for them.\n\nRead Tim Kawakami”s Talking Points blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami.
