Livingston, in his second stint with Washington, played 12 minutes on Saturday. He had averaged 3.7 points in 17 games.\n\nThe Wizards, who don't play until Wednesday, have 13 players on the active roster. Guard John Wall and forwards Trevor Ariza and Trevor Booker are currently sidelined because of injuries."
