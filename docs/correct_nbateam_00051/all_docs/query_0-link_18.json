        "text": "Veteran guard Shaun Livingston experienced a turbulent Christmas holiday. The former first-round NBA draft pick was cut by the Washington Wizards on Dec. 23 before getting picked up by the Cleveland Cavaliers on Dec. 25 to join his seventh NBA team. It marked the fourth time Livingston's been cut during an injury-plagued career.\n\nNeedless to say, it won't make for a happy reunion when Cleveland plays at Washington on Wednesday. Livingston, who was added to the Wizards' roster Nov. 15, was averaging 3.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 18.8 minutes a game for Washington.\n\n\"It's a struggle. I'm just trying to do my best to stay positive,\" Livingston said last week while discussing his career with USA TODAY Sports before the Wizards waived him. \"It's about understanding you're still blessed at the end of the day.\"\n\nLivingston, a 6-foot-7 point guard, was expected to fill in with guards John Wall and Jordan Crawford out with injuries. Bizarrely, Livingston went from starting in a Dec. 19 loss to the Orlando Magic, to out of a job just four days later. He played 17 games, including four starting assignments, for the Wizards, who own the NBA's worst record at 3-22.\n\nLivingston will now play back up to Kyrie Irving for the Cavaliers. His style fits coach Byron Scott's pass-and-cut Princeton offense.\n\nLivingston hasn't been the same player since a debilitating knee injury in 2007, and was in his second stint with the Wizards after reviving his career with the team in 2010. After bouncing from team to team—getting cut several times and playing in the NBA Developmental League—Livingston stayed on Washington's roster for the rest of the season after originally signing a 10-day contract. The next season, he signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the Charlotte Bobcats. Livingston was later traded to the Bucks in 2011 and then traded to the Rockets in 2012 before being waived in June.\n\n\"Obviously we're in a rough business,\" Livingston said. \"It's all about winning. You have to stay persistent and understand everything happens for a reason.\"\n\nLivingston's journey in the league has been far from what he expected it to be. The 27-year old was highly recruited as a point guard at Peoria Central (Ill.) High School. After opting out of a commitment to Duke, Livingston was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, the second high school player picked after Dwight Howard went No. 1.\n\nIn the midst of one of his most productive seasons and coming off a playoff run with the Clippers the season prior, Livingston's Feb., 2007 knee injury completely derailed his promising career. He injured almost every part of his knee, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament, the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral meniscus, while badly spraining and dislocating various joints and ligaments. He was finally cleared by doctors to play basketball again in June of 2007 and after parting ways with the Clippers, eventually signed with the Miami Heat before getting traded and eventually waved.\n\nDespite a frustrating career in which he lives \"day to day,\" Livingston is always trying to stay positive.\n\n\"You know, it could have been worse, the (knee injury) could have happened in high school or college where I didn't get a chance to live my dream and play in the NBA,\" he said. \"It's been about five years now (since the knee injury), I've been playing pretty consistently the last three-four years. With whatever prime that I have left, I just want to strive to be better, be the best that I can be and get every ounce of potential out of my body.\""
