        "text": "Using Machine Learning to analyze my favorite basketball team.\n\nTo see the entire code visit my Github: Here\n\nAs I watched the documentary The Last Dance featuring the Chicago Bulls, I anticipated the possibility of the show concluding with Michael Jordan’s final days in the NBA wearing a Wizards jersey. Unfortunately, after falling short to mention his NBA comeback to DC, I was left contemplating : Does anyone remember Michael Jordan playing for the Washington Wizards?\n\nAlthough his short lived career in a Wizards jersey has been deemed a failure by many, his time in the Nation’s Capital still remains a popular memory for the DC fan base. In addition to a deep dive of the 1998 Chicago Bulls season, the documentary also highlighted many supplemental players who played a role in the franchise winning its 6th championship. Players such as Tony Kucoc, Bill Cartwright, and Scott Burrell were a distant memory until the documentary featured them in the drama filled nationally televised series.\n\nInspired by the documentary, I decided to look into my own favorite team’s history and relive memories of those who played for the Washington Wizards. With the utilization of machine learning, I generated the two decade dream team consisting of the best players to have played for the Washington Wizards in the past 20 years. As I began exploring the dataset two questions quickly surfaced: Who would make this team?, and did the great Michael Jordan do enough in his two year stint to make it? Buckle your seatbelts, as the results may surprise you!\n\nStep 1: Data Acquisition and Initial Observation\n\nThe first step was to obtain the dataset from Basketball Reference. In total I obtained 182 players over the course of 20 years. The first observation I made was more or less “Wow I didn’t know that player played for the Wizards?” Below is a snapshot of some that I had forgotten over the past two decades. Bojan Bogdonovic is a premier player today, Shaun Livingston went on to win multiple championships with the Warriors, and Rasual Butler, passed away in an unfortunate tragic car accident just a few years ago.\n\nAlso worth noting is the position distribution. For example, over the past twenty years the Washington Wizards have rostered 46 shooting guards, and 20 centers. As a Wizards fan this bonds all too well with the team’s performance today. To think that over the past 20 years the team has only rostered a mere twenty centers is just one of many issues.\n\nStep 2: Identify statistical categories for each position.\n\nThere are many statistics that are recorded in the NBA and one of the challenges was determining how to evaluate each position since some performed better in more categories than others. For example, a point guard would not have a high value of blocks per game, so it wouldn’t make sense to use that as a statistic for the point guard position. To solve this problem, I took the average performance based on the following categories: FG%, TRB/G, STL/G, BLK/G, AST/G, PTS/G, and decided to use the following statistics for the given positions.\n\n1. Point Guard: AST/G, PTS/G, STLs/G\n\n2. Shooting Guard: AST/G, PTS/G, STL/G\n\n3. Small Forward: FG%, TRB/G\n\n4. Power Forward: BLK/G, FG%, TRB/G\n\n5. Center: FG%, TRB/G\n\nAfter determining how each position would be evaluated, I can only imagine John Wall’s face if he saw assists and steals.\n\nDid you know: Since 2014 John Wall ranks NUMBER 1 in assists per game at nearly 9.8 and stands 7th in steals averaging 1.8 per game\n\nStep 3: Use Machine Learning to create clusters for each position\n\nAfter determining each positions best-performing quality, I went ahead and created clusters within each position labeling each quality as predictive variables. Through an unsupervised machine learning model called K-Means Clustering, I’m able to group data around central points to create distinct clusters of similar data. The central points are represented by the letter k, which needs to be determined before simulating the model. In other words k will cluster players based on their statistical performance-the better the performing quality the higher the cluster ranking."
