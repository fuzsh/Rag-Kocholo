        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Warriors interim head coach Luke Walton has talked up how Shaun Livingston worked on his 3-point shot this offseason and could start shooting from long distance.\n\nHe still thinks it”s possible after Livingston played 23 minutes in the Warriors” 95-87 preseason-opening win against the Toronto Raptors and did not attempt any 3-pointers while Stephen Curry had fouled out.\n\n“I think he needs to retrain his mind almost,” Walton said Tuesday. “Like when he sees that (he”s naturally drifting into the paint), just to space out because we want him shooting threes, and I know he wants to do it.\n\n“He hasn”t passed up any yet, but he hasn”t gotten any yet, which leads me to believe he”s not hanging out around that 3-point line. Because, on our 3-point line, you should get some threes with the way we move and the double-teams our guys demand.”\n\nThe Warriors are looking for 3-point shooting off the bench and it remains to be seen if Livingston can add that element to his game after he has made only 10 shots from long distance in his 10-year career.\n\nWalton compared Livingston”s situation to one of his former teammates on one of the Los Angeles Lakers” championship team. Trevor Ariza, after hardly attempting any 3-pointers at the start of his career, gradually developed the shot in Los Angeles and now continues to shoot them at a high volume.\n\nWalton smiled and says he has a bet with Livingston that the 30-year-old owes pushups when he has an open look at a 3-pointer and doesn”t shoot.\n\n“He”s done the work with the repetitions and the skill,” Walton said. “He can shoot ”em now.”\n\n“It”s a private enterprise, and we intend to build, and we are going to build, and we are going to do in short order what we think will be a great edifice and institution for the city,” Lacob said. “And it will be one of the greatest arenas in the world in one of the greatest cities in the world.”\n\nThe Warriors” project is facing opposition and threats of lawsuits from the Mission Bay Alliance, an organization made up of current and former UCSF Medical Center researchers, faculty and stakeholders. UCSF chancellor Sam Hawgood announced in July that the project that neighbors the hospital has support contingent on traffic concerns being resolved.\n\nGentry, who was the Warriors” associate head coach last season and is close with Kerr, joined Walton and assistant coach Ron Adams in expressing that belief.\n\nWalton said Kerr visited practice earlier in the day for the purpose of looking at tape after the Warriors-Raptors game was not televised.\n\n“We weren”t picked to win it last year,” Curry said. “I don”t think we”re picked to win it this year, so all the motivation is already there for us, and we”re going to be ready.”\n\nAdded Draymond Green with a smile after he had previously declined comment: “That wasn”t going to be my answer.”\n\nFor more on the Warriors, see the Inside the Warriors blog at .
