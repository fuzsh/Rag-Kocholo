The Washington Wizards made a pair of moves Thursday, signing Shaun Livingston and waiving Jannero Pargo, the team announced via press release. Washington did not disclose the terms of Livingston's deal.

The Los Angeles Clippers originally selected Livingston in the first-round of the 2004, but he spent the 2009-10 season playing for the Wizards. He appeared in 26 games, making 18 starts for the team and averaging 9.2 points, 4.5 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game.

Livingston spent last season with the Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 5.5 points, 2.1 assists and 2.1 rebounds per game. The guard spent the preseason with the Houston Rockets, but Houston cut him before the season began.

To make room for Livingston, the Wizards waived Jannero Pargo. Pargo made appearances in seven games this season, averaging 3.0 points and 2.0 rebounds in 14.6 minutes per game.

The Wizards are winless this season after seven games. The team's next game is Saturday at home against the Utah Jazz.
