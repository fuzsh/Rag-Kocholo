The NBA-worst Washington Wizards waived center Earl Barron and guard Shaun Livingston early Sunday.

The moves were announced by the Wizards (3-22) about four hours after the team sustained its seventh straight loss, 96-87 at home to the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night.

Barron, who didn't play in the game, was averaging 2.5 points and 3.9 rebounds in 11 games. Livingston, in his second stint with Washington, played 12 minutes on Saturday. He had averaged 3.7 points in 17 games.

The Wizards, who don't play until Wednesday, have 13 players on the active roster. Guard John Wall and forwards Trevor Ariza and Trevor Booker are currently sidelined because of injuries.
