It is often overshadowed by glamorous Barcelona, stylish Seville and Basque Country or marvelous Bilbao. But you will not be disappointed if you include a detour to the capital of Spain.\n\nAs we did during our Spanish vacation. We realized after our trip of 2 days in Madrid it well deserves its own spotlight of fame.\n\nMadrid is the third largest city in Europe after Berlin and London. It has a rich and long history dating back to Roman times. The chronicles of Madrid begin with the founding of “Mayrit” on the banks of the River Manzanares by Muhammad I, the Emir of Cordoba in the late ninth century A. D.\n\nHistoric Madrid\n\nThe Muslim Age came to an end when the city and its citadel were conquered by Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085. Over the centuries, Madrid came to prominence under the Arabs and then under the Christians during the Reconquest of Spain.\n\nMany treasures of these eras before the classic period can be seen in the National Archaeological Museum located in the Salamanca District.\n\nThe layer upon layer of the history of Madrid entails an abundance of unmissable landmarks. If you are on a short visit like we were, you may feel slightly intimidated by the choices. But with a bit of advanced planning, you can have a fulfilling and enjoyable trip.\n\nHow to Spend 2 Days in Madrid\n\nWe spent a busy couple of days taking in the wealth of attractions that Madrid offers, ranging from lavish palaces to verdant parks to world-class art museums. Here is how we spent our time:\n\nDay 1 in Madrid\n\nPuerto del Sol\n\nWe started our day at a bustling square in the middle of Madrid. This lively plaza, known as Puerta del Sol gets crowded with tourists and locals. Everyone comes here to get a look at some of Madrid’s most iconic symbols.\n\nThis is the beginning point of the six national roads of Spain. It is denoted by a Kilometer Zero stone slab which tourists flock to see. The clock on the Real Casa de Correos is another point of interest known for indicating the Spanish New Year tradition of eating 12 grapes.\n\nFinally, the statue of the bear and the strawberry tree, a representation of Madrid city’s coat of arms, or El Oso y el Madrono at the entrance of Calle Alcala is delightful to look at and should not be missed.\n\nPlaza Mayor\n\nNext, we headed to Plaza Mayor, one of Madrid’s prettiest, oldest and grandest squares. It’s an open, expansive space with a history spanning 400 years. A bronze statue of King Felipe III, constructed in 1616 by Juan Cristóbal González, Jean Boulogne and Pietro Tacca graces the square center. It was placed there in 1848.\n\nThe square has the unique architecture of a grand arcade and is symmetrically rectangular in shape. It was built during the illustrious Habsburg period. We stepped onto the bustling plaza surrounded by magnificent buildings with wrought iron balconies, 237 of them according to madridtouristinfo.com.\n\nPlaza Mayor, as we know it today, is the handiwork of architect Juan de Villanueva. He did the reconstruction in 1858 after a series of big fires.\n\nWhile three buildings are three floors tall, at the north end of the square, notice the Casa de la Panadería stands four floors tall. This building has frescoes adorning the facades, originally from 1590 but newly repainted by Carlos Franco in 1992.\n\nPlaza Mayor thrums with liveliness. It is jam-packed with tourists and locals who come here to enjoy the vibrancy of the place. Most will walk into the many laneways that exit out into the labyrinthine of streets around. We walked along the porticoes of the interconnected buildings peeking into food stalls selling local meats and shops selling local crafts.\n\nSan Miguel Market\n\nAbout a three-minute leisurely stroll from Plaza Mayor is San Miguel Market, a gastronomic delight. Over 100 years old, Mercado de San Miguel, which began as a wholesale marketplace, is now an epicurean paradise, with 30 food stands.\n\nBuilt in 1916, the market is also an exemplary example of iron architecture with a beautiful high ceiling that floods the interior with natural light.\n\nYou can sample delicious tapas, paella, cheeses, fresh fruits, desserts and more. Try to find yourself a seat at one of the tables. Or, get a takeout like we did, and have a fabulous lunch. Some stalls offer free samples and even a complimentary glass of wine if you order something from the stand.\n\nRoyal Palace of Madrid\n\nA must-visit attraction is the Royal Palace of Madrid, the abode of the Spanish royal family. The palace began its life as a fortress when Madrid was known by its Arabic name, Magerit. It continued to be a fort until the 14th century.\n\nThe building became a royal residence under King Charles I and his son, Philip II. After a fire in 1734 destroyed this palace, King Philip V rebuilt the palace that we see today.\n\nStart planning your extraordinary vacation to Memphis today. Get prepared insider tips on how to get around, hotel and VRBO accommodations, restaurant reviews and more through TripAdvisor and Travelocity.\n\nPlan even more fun with unique Memphis activities, skip-the-line tickets and expert-led tours through Get Your Guide. Find more information and book your adventure here.\n\nOur journey to enjoy the fineries of the Royal Palace commenced as we walked across the expansive royal courtyard after buying our tickets. Tickets can also be booked in advance.\n\nWe stood in the center, marveling at the glory of the architecture surrounding us in the plaza. The palace is massive with more than 3000 rooms and includes a head-turning staircase. We toured the Royal Armory, the Painting Gallery with works of Caravaggio, Goya, Velazquez and other famous Spanish artists.\n\nThe Royal Kitchen was fun to walk through, while the Throne Hall was splendid with its fancy ceiling painted by Tiepolo. If you are there on Wednesdays or Saturdays, do not miss the splendid Changing of the Guard ceremony.\n\nIn addition, outside of the months of January, August and September, you can also catch the Solemn Changing of the Guard on the first Wednesday of each month.\n\nCatedral de Santa La Almudena\n\nSituated next to the Royal Palace of Madrid is the Catedral de Santa Maria La Real de La Almudena. It is the grandest church in all of Madrid and the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid. Though the capital of Spain shifted from Toledo to Madrid in 1561, the city did not get a primary church for about 400 years. La Almudena Cathedral’s construction began in 1879 and it was consecrated in 1993 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe Gothic Revival-style cathedral is certainly a sight to behold. Inside there is a Romanesque-style crypt that is home to a 16th-century image of Virgen de la Almudena. There is also a small museum that requires a fee to enter. If you have time you must ascend to the dome of the building for a superb view of Madrid.\n\nPlaza de España\n\nHead to Plaza de España, a picturesque square with fountains, leafy gardens and a number of monuments. We did a bit of people-watching, relaxing by the serene pond at this plaza that is highly popular amongst both tourists and locals.\n\nFor an incredible experience, a visit to the Temple of Debod is a must to wrap up your evening sightseeing. Watch the sunset from this temple that dates to the 2nd century BCE. It was a gift from Egypt to Spain in 1968 after the Spanish helped in saving the temples of Nubia.\n\nDay Two\n\nMuseo Nacional del Prado\n\nMadrid is home to the premier Museo Nacional del Prado, a never-ending repository of Spain’s artistic treasures. Also, a collection of Italian, French and Flemish art.\n\nWhile it is a challenge to cover the entire museum in one visit, a bit of prior planning and study can help you focus. There are three floors of over 7,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings and sketches that are exhibited through permanent and rotating exhibitions.\n\nBe sure not to miss the paintings by El Greco, Francisco Goya, Peter Paul Rubens and Titian. Spend time on the celebrated masterpieces “Las Meninas” by Diego Velazquez and “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Hieronymus Bosch.\n\nAlso unmissable is the eye-catching architecture of the museum building. It was designed by Juan de Villanueva in 1785, on the orders of Charles III, the King of Spain. And it began as a museum to house the royal collection.\n\nGolden Triangle of Art\n\nThe Prado, Reina Sofia and the Thyssen Bornemisza museum form the “Golden Triangle of Art” in Madrid. They were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021. So, you must find time to visit the two other museums on this “Art Walk”.\n\nWe started with the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, home to modern and contemporary Spanish Art. The star attraction here amidst the works of Salvador Dali, Joan Miró, Juan Gris and others is the world-renowned masterpiece, “Guernica”.\n\nThis piece was painted by Pablo Picasso in oil on canvas in his classic Cubist style in 1937 following the German bombing of the Spanish town of Guernica. The artwork has now become an icon and an anti-war symbol.\n\nThe Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza is situated a stone’s throw distance from the Prado. It holds a magnificent collection of European paintings from the 13th to the 20th centuries. The museum building is the impressive 18th-century Villahermosa Palace. It was restored to house well-known works by the likes of Picasso, Rembrandt, Dali, El Greco and more.\n\nEl Retiro\n\nThe Buen Retiro Park or El Retiro is the largest public park in Madrid and a 2021 entrant to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. It contains more than 15,000 trees and covers over 125 hectares. The park, built in the mid-17th century by King Felipe IV, is immensely popular among locals and visitors since it was opened to the public in 1868.\n\nWe enjoyed our leisurely walk through the park admiring the greenery, the many monuments and statues and the central lake. Also, we marveled at the Puerta de Alcala, a neoclassical gate of five triumphal arches, the first one built in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nOf particular interest at El Retiro is the Palacio de Cristal or the Crystal Palace built in 1887 to be used as a greenhouse to exhibit animals and plants from the Philippines, which was then a Spanish Colony.\n\nNow it showcases temporary exhibitions for the Reina Sofia Museum. The Glass Palace is a magnificent example of cast-iron architecture and is modeled on a crystal palace that was erected in Hyde Park in London in 1851.\n\nSantiago Bernabeu Stadium\n\nIf your group includes soccer enthusiasts, you could venture to the home of the Real Madrid football team, the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, located not far from the city center. Built in 1947 and with a seating capacity of around 81,000 spectators, it is the second-largest football stadium in Spain.\n\nVisitors can take a tour of the trophy rooms, the visiting players’ dressing rooms and the VIP viewing boxes. Plus, you can take a bite at Gate 57, the restaurant with a sublime view of the playing field.\n\nThe Gran Via\n\nThe Gran Via is the primary thoroughfare in Madrid and certainly its most famous. Calle Gran Via was constructed between 1910 and 1929 and was an important urban construction that was possible by demolishing more than 300 buildings and many streets.\n\nThis has resulted in a central boulevard that is lined with remarkable architecture, shopping destinations and dining options, earning it the nickname of Spanish Broadway.\n\nAn excellent way to conclude your Madrid visit would be to enjoy a concert, opera or a flamenco performance at Teatro Real, the majestic Madrid Opera House built originally in 1850. The theater is also open for guided or self-guided tours.\n\nGetting to Madrid by Train\n\nWe reached Madrid from Barcelona Sants train station after a mere three-hour train journey. A distance of about 400 miles was covered easily by the AVE high-speed train and we disembarked in Atocha Station, Madrid’s first train station that was inaugurated in 1851.\n\nToday the station is a busy hub where a primary attraction is a lush tropical garden that is surrounded by retail, food and leisure outlets. Close to 7,000 plants and a variety of fish in a pond occupy a cavernous space topped by an iron and glass roof with a skylight creating a jungle-like atmosphere.\n\nThe garden occupies the original 19th-century station as a new station was built in 1992 to accommodate the modern high-speed train links. We spent many minutes walking around the garden.\n\nHere we enjoyed the lushness of the greenhouse, noticing tall palm and coconut trees, rubber and banana trees, among many other plants and flowers. In addition, we were enamored by the goldfish populating the pond.\n\nWhere to Stay in Madrid\n\nMadrid has plenty of hotels to suit different budgets. But it is important to find a comfortable one, preferably close to the city’s main attractions, especially if you are in a time crunch. The best hotels are mostly located in and around the vibrant city center.\n\nVP Plaza España Design, a superb luxury hotel and our place of stay, is located in the Plaza de España and is close to Gran Via, the Temple of Debod, the Almudena Cathedral and the Royal Palace.\n\nHotel Mayorazgo is another great choice located in the Gran Via, and close to Plaza de España.\n\nWhere to Eat in Madrid\n\nThere are countless tapas bars in Madrid and if you have a bit of free time, a tapas crawl can be an excellent way to bring your evening to a close.\n\nFill up with small portions of seafood, meats, salads, veggies and tasty deep-fried bites like jamon croquetas (ham croquettes). Most tapas plates are cheap unless you order seafood.\n\nCerveceria Plaza Mayor 2: Opposite the Casa de la Panaderia, and there since 1976, with extended seating on the terrace of Plaza Mayor, this place offers splendid views and delectable tapas.\n\nMuseo del Jamõn: There are many outposts of these “ham museums” where you will see rows of hams on display from the ceiling, on the walls and in display cases. Needless to say, their specialty is ham which is sourced from all over Spain but you will have a unique experience.\n\nChurreria Chocolateria 1902: More than 100 years old and a wonderful place to go to for breakfast, tea, lunch or dinner. And a must-visit for its chocolates and churros, the deliciously deep-fried dough sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, from Spanish or Mexican cuisine.\n\nFor more information on all the above visit: https://www.esmadrid.com/en"
