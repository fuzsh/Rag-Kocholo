        "text": "AKA Jacinto Benavente y Martinez\n\nBorn: 12-Aug-1866\n\nBirthplace: Madrid, Spain\n\nDied: 14-Jul-1954\n\nLocation of death: Madrid, Spain\n\nCause of death: Heart Failure\n\nRemains: Buried, Galapagar Cemetery, Madrid, Spain\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: Hispanic\n\nSexual orientation: Gay\n\nOccupation: Playwright\n\nNationality: Spain\n\nExecutive summary: The Bonds of Interest\n\nJacinto Benavente was one of Spain's foremost 20th century playwrights, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1922 for \"the happy manner in which he has continued the illustrious traditions of the Spanish drama\". Benavente's works have run on Broadway ten times, and were filmed eight times as silent movies and more than a dozen times as talkies.\n\nHe was raised in an aristocratic family and studied to become a lawyer, but when his father died, leaving Benavente a sizable inheritance, he dropped out of college, toured Europe, worked briefly as an actor, and began writing. After several of his plays had been produced to little acclaim, he had his first success with Gente Conocida (High Society), a biting satire of his own Madrid blue blood roots. His Los Intereses Creados (The Bonds of Interest), in which a wily servant manipulates his master as a puppet, became a staple of Spanish-language theater.\n\nHis 1928 play Para el Cielo y los Altares (Toward Heaven and the Altars) was deemed subversive and banned by the Spanish government, and during the Spanish Civil War he was held under house arrest. He later became an outspoken supporter of his nation's murderous Francisco Franco's regime, which tended to diminish his popularity.\n\nLaw School: University of Madrid (1882-85, dropped out)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1922\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nThe Fantastic Theatre (1892, collection of short plays)\n\nVersos (1893, poetry)\n\nCartas de Mujeres (The Letters of Women) (1893)\n\nEl Nido Ajeno (Other Bird's Nest) (1894, play)\n\nGente Conocida (High Society) (1896, play)\n\nLa Gobernadora (The Governor's Wife) (1901, play)\n\nLa Noche del Sábado (Saturday Night) (1903, play)\n\nLos Malhechores del Bien (The Evil Doers of Good) (1905, play)\n\nRosas de Otoño (Autumnal Roses) (1905, play)\n\nLos Intereses Creados (The Bonds of Interest) (1907, play)\n\nSeñora Ama (The Lady of the House) (1908, play)\n\nLa Malquerida (The Passion Flower) (1913, play)\n\nLa Vestal de Occidente (The Vestal of the West) (1919, play)\n\nLa Noche Iluminada (The Illuminated Night) (1927, play)\n\nPepa Doncel (1928, play)\n\nPara el Cielo y los Altares (Toward Heaven and the Altars) (1928, play)\n\nLo Increíble (The Incredible) (1941, play)\n\nLa Infanzona (The Ancient Noblewoman) (1948, play)\n\nEl Lebrel del Cielo (Hounds of Heaven) (1952, play, based on a poem by Francis Thompson)\n\nHijos, Padres de Sus Padres (Sons, Fathers of Their Parents) (1954, play)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
