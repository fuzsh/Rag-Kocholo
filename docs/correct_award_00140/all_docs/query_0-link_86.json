But historians seem to agree on a few possibilities. One is the theatre of Atellan Farce, taken from Roman fables that revolved around crass and ridiculous physical comedy, a prominent feature of Commedia.\n\nThe second possibility is that it may have been derived from mime theatre made popular by monks of the Byzantine Era.\n\nWho knew monks did comedy? Well believe it or not, this is where mime comes from. If you’ve seen any Commedia (here is a good Italian sample), you may have noticed that many Commedia characters do not speak at all during performances, instead babbling incoherently to humorous effect.\n\nThe final possibility and perhaps the most likely would be Bohemian influences from Europe where performers took to the streets to put on shows. Commedia was frequently performed in public squares in the early years.[1]\n\ni (The) Gelosi – The First Troupe\n\nThe first Commedia performances happened around 1551 when “unorganized strolling players, acrobats, street entertainers started to coalesce.” I Gelosi was the first incorporated theatre troupe of its kind that employed professional actors. The company would have paid the performers a salary and charged admission to its shows – a big step forward in helping establish theatre as a true profession. Interestingly, The Gelosi’s coat of arms was the two-faced Roman god Janus, and symbolized the travelling nature of the group, as well as the dual personalities often portrayed by the actors.[2] The Gelosi performed both in Italy and in France, where they received both patronage and protection from the king.\n\nWomen in Commedia\n\nOne of the first stories of gender equality on the stage happened in the world of Commedia dell’Arte. Unlike other forms of theatre, the female roles in Commedia were actually portrayed by women. These women were respected and valued for their ability to perform and their own individual qualities. However, they were at times badly denigrated by critics, and for a period in Italy, a short-lived effort was made to ban women from the Commedia stage. But by the end of the 16th century their presence was largely accepted.[3]\n\nEarly 17th Century – A change in form\n\nBy the early 17th century the format of Commedia was changing from strictly improvisational to something much more scripted, with clearly structured acts and characters. Several books written during the 17th century made recommendations about how the plays should be performed. Some critics argued that this change caused the performances to become formulaic and stylized, taking away the improvisational quality that made Commedia so unique.[4]\n\n17th Century – Taking shape\n\nDespite its supposed Italian origins, Commedia dell’Arte wound up being more popular in France (there called The Comédie-Italienne) than Italy throughout the 17th century. In fact, it was in France where it developed its established repertoire. As it moved elsewhere across Europe it continued to evolve and adapt based on the cultural preferences of its adoptive countries. In England, The Punch and Judy puppet shows, still popular today, owe their concept to the Pulcinella mask from the Neapolitan (the city of Napoli) version of the form.\n\nUnfortunately Commedia took a big hit during the 17th century in Great Britain, mostly due to the Puritan influence. The Puritans were not big supporters of the arts of any kind and shows were often banned altogether. Napoleon also played his part in limiting its spread. During his occupation of Italy, proponents of reform and critics of French rule used the carnival masks to hide their identities while pushing political agendas, challenging social rule, and hurling insults and criticisms at the regime.[5] So to put an end to it, Napoleon banned Commedia Dell’Arte completely. His banning was a major blow as Commedia did not resurface again until 1979 in Venice, and much of its original quality has been lost history.\n\nEarly 18th Century\n\nBy the early 1700s, Commedia troupes had entertained audiences across the continent and had even been “commissioned to play for Europe’s most distinguished monarchs, including Queen Elizabeth, Louis XIV, and Russia’s Empress Anna.”[6] By the end of the 18th and 19th century Commedia players eventually found their way overseas to the new world.[7] Do the names Harlequin, Columbine, Scaramouche, and Pantaloon sound familiar? They are the popular names of clowns now heard frequently today in all types of theatrical performances. Cirque du Soleil comes to mind.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile much of the purest form of Commedia has been lost to the history books, the majority of its influence today is still widely felt in all forms of theatre today. Fortunately with companies like Odyssey Theatre, much of the art is being recaptured and brought back to its former glory. While this year’s production of Lysistrata and the Temple of Gaia is not a Commedia play, you will see clear evidence of Commedia’s influence in the play’s outrageous side-splitting antics.\n\nSo here’s to the continued success and history of a truly remarkable art form! Next time you see a clearly recognizable type of acting, be sure to ask yourself how that character came to be. Because there is a good chance it started in Commedia!\n\n[1] Commedia dell’arte. https://www.britannica.com/art/commedia-dellarte (accessed April 21, 2018)\n\n[2] Commedia dell’arte. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte (accessed April 19, 2018)\n\n[3] A History of Commedia dell’Arte. http://www.factionoffools.org/history (accessed April 21, 2018)\n\n[4] Commedia dell’arte. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte (accessed April 19, 2018)\n\n[5] Commedia dell’arte. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte (accessed April 23, 2018)\n\n[6] A History of Commedia dell’Arte. http://www.factionoffools.org/history (accessed April 20, 2018)) http://www.factionoffools.org/history\n\n[7] A History of Commedia dell’Arte. http://www.factionoffools.org/history (accessed April 20, 2018))\n\nFor the 33rd season of Theatre Under the Stars, Odyssey Theatre is presenting Lysistrata and the Temple of Gaia, a world premiere of award-winning playwright David S. Craig’s new comedy. The play, which runs from July 26-August 26, 2018, is set 100 years in the future, and climate change has made the world inhospitable. The rising oceans are acidic, the air is toxic, and the plants and animals are dying.\n\nBut, for the people of the future, it is easy to dismiss all of this as “just the weather.” Easy, that is, until an ancient goddess named Gaia appears and threatens to destroy all humanity unless they promise to take better care of the planet. The women agree, the men refuse, and a comedic battle of the sexes ensues.\n\nInspired by a Classic\n\nThe play is inspired by the one of the earliest Western comedies, the Ancient Greek classic Lysistrata by Aristophanes, in which Athenian women go on a sex strike to stop a war. In Lysistrata and the Temple of Gaia, the women strike to save the planet.\n\n“When I started developing this new version, I thought about what the biggest threat to humanity would be in 2118,” says Craig. “It would not be war anymore. It would be climate change.”\n\nThe Toronto-based playwright, over the course of a 44-year career, has had over thirty plays produced across Canada, the United States and Europe. He has produced political comedy for the CBC and his work has been translated into five languages. This is Craig’s second time at the helm of an Odyssey production, his first being 2012’s The Fan, for which he won the Prix Rideau Award for Outstanding Adaptation.\n\nTalented Cast and Company\n\nCraig will be directing an experienced cast of veterans and newcomers to the Odyssey stage. Returning to the outdoor theatre are Sarah Finn, Catriona Leger, and David Warburton. They will be joined by the talents of David daCosta, Natalia Gracious, Martin Julien, Lisa Norton, and Shelly Simester as Lysistrata.\n\nThe actors will be backed by the outstanding design team of Jerrard Smith (Set Design) and Lori Hickling (Costume Design), Graham Price (Lighting Design) and Rick Sacks (Sound Design), who will create a fully-formed future world with classical underpinnings in which people have adapted to the reality of climate change.\n\nWith the experienced company backing this comedic and original script, this year’s Theatre Under the Stars season will be one to remember: the perfect evening out in Strathcona Park.\n\nAbout Odyssey Theatre\n\nFor 32 years, Odyssey has made its home along the banks of the Rideau River in beautiful Strathcona Park. Known for its award-winning performances featuring Commedia dell’Arte, mask, movement, music, elaborate sets, and comedy, Odyssey has become a staple of summer in the Nation’s Capital. Its Theatre Under the Stars program has won many accolades, including 2017 Prix Rideau Awards for Outstanding Direction, Production, and Female Performance.\n\nLysistrata and the Temple of Gaia runs nightly at 8pm from July 26-August 26, 2018, with matinees on Sunday afternoons at 2pm.
