        "text": "Summary: The purpose of this annotated edition is twofold: to simplify the reading of Benavente's Lo cursi for American college students and to give the reader a greater appreciation of Benavente's contribution to the Spanish theater. The introduction includes a summary of Benavente's life, his political and moral philosophies, and his relationship to current literary trends. A classification of his works is made based on \"El lugar escenico.\" Lo cursi is then analyzed in relation to Benavente's techniques and style in his other plays. In the annotation innuendoes and witticisms are explained in the footnotes, while on the right hand side of the printed text words which might provide difficulty for the English reader are defined.
