        "text": "In this article, the first or paternal family name is Benavente and the second or maternal family name is y Martínez.\n\nJacinto Benavente y Martínez (12 August 1866 – 14 July 1954) was one of the foremost Spanish dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1922 \"for the happy manner in which he has continued the illustrious traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Madrid, the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics.\n\nA liberal monarchist and a critic of socialism, he was a reluctant supporter of Francoist Spain as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931–1936. In 1936 Benavente's name became associated with the assassination of the Spanish poet and dramatist Federico García Lorca. This happened when the Nationalist newspapers Estampa, El Correo de Andalucia, and Ideal circulated a fake news story that Lorca had been killed as a reprisal for the Republican murder of Benavente. Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona (Toledo) at the age of 87. He never married. According to many sources, he was homosexual.\n\nPrincipal works\n\nJacinto Benavente wrote 172 works. Among his most important works are:\n\nEl nido ajeno (Another's Nest, 1894), comedy, three acts.\n\nGente conocida (High Society, 1896), satirical scenes of modern life, four acts.\n\nLa Gobernadora (The Governor's Wife, 1901), comedy, three acts.\n\nRosas de otoño (Autumnal Roses, 1905), sentimental comedy, three acts.\n\nLos intereses creados (The Bonds of Interest, 1907), comedy of masks based on the Italian commedia dell'arte; Benavente's most famous and often performed work.\n\nSeñora ama (The Lady of the House, 1908), rural drama; a penetrating psychological study of a woman jealous of her husband.\n\nEl príncipe que todo lo aprendió en los libros (1909)\n\nThe Unloved Woman (La malquerida), 1913), rural psychological drama, three acts; the basis for the 1921 film The Passion Flower, starring Norma Talmadge.\n\nLa ciudad alegre y confiada (1916), continuation from Los intereses creados.\n\nCampo de armiño (1916)\n\nLecciones de buen amor (1924)\n\nLa mariposa que voló sobre el mar (1926)\n\nPepa Doncel (1928)\n\nVidas cruzadas (1929)\n\nAves y pájaros (1940)\n\nLa honradez de la cerradura (1942)\n\nLa infanzona (1945)\n\nTitania (1946)\n\nLa infanzona (1947)\n\nAbdicación (1948)\n\nHa llegado Don Juan (1952)\n\nEl alfiler en la boca (1954)\n\nHijos, padres de sus padres (Sons, Fathers of Their Parents, 1954)\n\nSee also"
