        "text": "In this week’s Comment, Adam Gopnik discusses the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was won last week by the Peruvian writer and political activist Mario Vargas Llosa. (Gopnik answered readers’ questions in a live chat on Monday afternoon.)\n\nAfter identifying some specious winners in the past, Gopnik writes that this year’s pick seems just:\n\nSo all hail Vargas Llosa, whom even his noisier left-wing critics have to regard as exactly the kind of writer the prize ought to go to: one with a host of well-regarded novels (“The Time of the Hero,” “Conversation in the Cathedral,” the screen-adapted “Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,” “The Feast of the Goat”) and a sense of social responsibility (he ran seriously for, and lost badly, the Presidency of Peru), not to mention a lively personal life that includes once punching out another future laureate with an equally impressive triple-barrelled moniker, Gabriel García Márquez, reportedly over something to do with Mrs. Vargas Llosa.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has long been controversial; the list of winners seems to be dwarfed by the list of undisputed masters who were snubbed. In 1991, Gopnik wrote a Comment (available free for subscribers) on the Nobel laureates in literature from the beginning of the twentieth century who have disappeared from public consciousness, or as he puts it, “seem to have no rank at all.”\n\nRudolf Christoph Eucken, Karl Adolph Gjellerup, and Henrik Pontoppidan; Carl Friedrich Georg Spitteler, Carl Gustaf Verner von Heidenstam, and Jacinto Benavente; Frans Eemil Sillanpää, and Johannes Vilhelm Jensen. Who were they, and what did they write?\n\nFrom his survey of these winners, Gopnik suggests to the aspiring Nobel laureate the following: write long epics in a nationalistic (preferably Scandinavian) vein; start or emerge as the central practitioner of an odd literary movement; or title your works with “arresting, unlooked-for juxtaposition of adjective and noun.”\n\nIn 2005, Louis Menand reviewed “The Economy of Prestige,” by James English, a study of the politics and history of literary prizes. Here, Menand distills English’s argument about the core purpose of such awards:\n\nAs long as we want to believe that creative achievement is special, that a work of art is not just one more commodity seeking to aggrandize itself in the marketplace at the expense of other works of art, we need prizes so that we can complain about how stupid they are. In this respect, it is at least as important that the prize go to the wrong person as that it go to the right one. No one thinks that Tolstoy was less than a great writer because he failed to win the Nobel. The failure to win the Nobel has become, in the end, a mark of his greatness."
