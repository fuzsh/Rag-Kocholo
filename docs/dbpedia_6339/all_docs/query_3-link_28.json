        "text": "âWeâve been to hell and brought it with us.â So reads the slogan, written in Hungarian, English and several other languages, beneath which the players of both teams pass on their way from the changing rooms to the pitch at FerencvÃ¡rosâs home stadium. It serves, first of all, as a message of warning.\n\nOpponents from DjugÃ¥rden, Dinamo Zagreb and Molde did not encounter hell as such at the start of this season, but their Champions League qualifying hopes all went up in smoke a few steps beyond those words. So too the 2-0 lead that Dynamo Kyiv held when Champions League group stage football returned to the FerencvÃ¡ros district of Budapest on 28 October, Franck Boliâs 90th-minute goal earning the Hungarian titleholders a point.\n\nFor the nationâs most successful and best-supported club, the reference to hell conveys something else entirely: a sense of the long and tortuous road travelled since their previous appearance in the group stage 25 years ago.\n\nâTwenty unstable yearsâ is how Andy Clark, a Scotsman resident in Hungary for more than two decades, describes a period which brought a series of financial crises and culminated in the clubâs enforced relegation to the second tier in 2006. âThey couldnât pay players, owed money to state companies and were refused a licence,â explains Clark, a season-ticket holder at the time and now covering the clubâs return to the Champions League for UEFA.com. âThere were some games where we had a bigger crowd at FerencvÃ¡ros than all of the top-division games put together.â\n\nThat huge supporter base â estimated at 50% of football fans in the country â also includes followers among the ethnic Hungarian populations in neighbouring Slovakia and Romania, who in ordinary times undertake long car journeys to attend home fixtures. In Clarkâs view, these supporters ask for one thing above all. âThey want you to sweat blood for the team. They had a defender in the 1990s, Tibor Simon, who said, âYou can play badly but never without heart.ââ\n\nThe late Simon â tragically killed in an assault outside a Budapest club in 2002 â was a member of the FerencvÃ¡ros line-up which, at the time of writing, posted the last victory by a Hungarian club in the Champions League group stage: 3-0 at Grasshoppers in September 1995. Simon played with a broken hand that night, among the highlights of a campaign which inspired a 25th-anniversary documentary film, The Team of Passions.\n\nâThey were a real team,â says current captain GergÅ Lovrencsics. âAfter watching that documentary us Hungarians understood that they did well because they stuck together.â A winning formula his side followed to a tee during qualifying. âI said some words as captain before the match [against Molde], but I wasnât really needed because I saw the fire in their eyes. We also played like a real team and this was the result. Itâs true weâve had to wait a long time for it, but we are back in the Champions League.â\n\nTo understand the place the 31-time national champions occupy in Hungarian sporting culture, it is important to consider their origins. FerencvÃ¡rosi Torna Club were established during the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1899, initially as a gymnastics club. Budapest was then predominantly German-speaking, and the clubâs nickname of Fradi comes from the German translation of FerencvÃ¡ros, namely Franzstadt.\n\nFradi were in the vanguard of footballâs growth in Hungary. They were the first club to open a purpose-built football stadium in 1911. That same year they went on a tour to Germany and England, losing only one of six matches as their enduring (if self-appointed) âTeam of the nationâ epithet was born.\n\nEarly success in Europe came with two victories in the Mitropa Cup â a forerunner to UEFAâs club competitions â with the second, in 1937 against Lazio, following six goals across the two legs of the final by GyÃ¶rgy SÃ¡rosi, who would captain Hungary to the next yearâs World Cup final. From that position of strength, FerencvÃ¡rosâs fortunes dipped after the Second World War. The Communist regime did not look favourably on this strongly nationalist club: among the impositions, they had to change their name â to ÃDOSZ and then Kinizsi â and their colours to red and white. Moreover, the deliberate dismantling of their 1948/49 title-winning team led to LÃ¡szlÃ³ Budai, ZoltÃ¡n Czibor and SÃ¡ndor Kocsis â all members of Hungaryâs great Mighty Magyars side â joining rivals HonvÃ©d, the then flourishing army team.\n\nSupporting FerencvÃ¡ros became a symbol that you were against the regime. When they reclaimed the title in 1962/63, their first for 14 years, it inspired a popular chant aimed at JÃ¡nos KÃ¡dÃ¡r, leader of the Hungarian Communists: âFerencvÃ¡ros are champions. How do you like that, JÃ¡nos KÃ¡dÃ¡r?â\n\nThat title was the cue for the clubâs golden era in Europe, spearheaded by FlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert. Joint-top scorer at the 1962 World Cup, Albert won the 1967 Ballon DâOr. In between, he helped his only club to their Inter-Cities Fairs Cup triumph, defeating Roma and Manchester United along the way before a 1-0 final victory against Juventus.\n\nMÃ¡tÃ© Fenyvesi grabbed the winner in Turin from a DezsÅ NovÃ¡k cross, though not all his team-mates noticed at the time. âFlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert and ZoltÃ¡n Varga arrived in the box as usual, but FlÃ³ri was pushed away by the defenders,â Fenyvesi recalls. âI was behind him so I was able to head the ball into the net. FlÃ³ri didnât realise Iâd scored so he started to argue with the ref. I had to shout, âFlÃ³ri, leave it, I scored â weâre in the lead!ââ\n\nFerencvÃ¡ros had more continental feats up their sleeves too, reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup the next season before returning to the Fairs Cup final in 1968. Liverpool and Athletic were both defeated home and away, though a 1-0 loss to Leeds United dashed their trophy hopes in the decider.\n\nFate had it that it was Albertâs son, FlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert Jr, who was the hero of their group stage campaign in 1995/96 â a run which pitted them against holders Ajax and Real Madrid, along with Grasshoppers. âOne of our eyes was crying while the other was laughing,â Albert says, recalling the response when the draw was made. He duly provided the high point with the goal that earned a 1-1 home draw with Madrid â something to celebrate after a 5-1 home loss to Ajax and 6-1 drubbing at the Santiago BernabÃ©u. âWe had an anniversary event [recently] to commemorate the journey. We qualified for the Champions League 30 years after my fatherâs team won the UEFA Cup.Â We were discussing that itâs been 25 years since then, so these might be mystical numbers.â\n\nSo it has proved and the wish now is for FerencvÃ¡ros to make Europe a regular fixture once again. Coached by the former Ukraine, Dynamo Kyiv and Tottenham Hotspur forward Serhiy Rebrov, the Hungarians reached the Europa League group stage in 2019/20 and are now scripting another feel good story. âThis development has been over the longer term, with the group stage of the Europa League and being very competitive there last season, and now making one more step forward,â says sporting director TamÃ¡s Hajnal, a ball boy during FerencvÃ¡rosâs last Champions League adventure. âIâm not saying weâre a Champions League team â for sure notâ but we want to be competitive and reach one of the group stages of the European competitions [each year]. This makes our club interesting for players too. You can sense it in the negotiations when you approach them.â\n\nSince politician GÃ¡bor Kubatov took over the club presidency in 2011, FerencvÃ¡ros have become an ever more attractive proposition. That was a significant year for more than one reason: FerencvÃ¡ros, the multi-sport organisation, succeeded in buying out the football clubâs departing English owner, Kevin McCabe, for the sum of â¬1.\n\nThe Hungarian state acquired from McCabe the land on which the stadium stands. A year later, FerencvÃ¡ros regained the merchandising and marketing rights that had been sold during an earlier era of missteps. By 2014, they had a new stadium, freshly opened on the same site as their two previous grounds.\n\nFerencvÃ¡rosâs return to prominence mirrors an overall renaissance for Hungarian football since the election in 2010 of SÃ¡ndor CsÃ¡nyi, a billionaire banker, as president of the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ). First came the hosting of the Under-19 EURO in 2014. Then, in 2019, the Womenâs Champions League final was played at FerencvÃ¡ros Stadion. This year, the rebuilt PuskÃ¡s ArÃ©na staged the UEFA Super Cup, and four EURO 2020 matches will follow there next summer. At grassroots level, a pitch-building project has helped double the number of registered players.\n\nWhatever happens to FerencvÃ¡ros this season, the challenge is to sustain their success. Skipper Lovrencsics reflects: âFerencvÃ¡ros is everything. It has a great history, it fights to achieve big things that are similar to my goals. Building a club is hard work. The ambition of doing well in Europe again is true to its tradition, and FerencvÃ¡ros wants to put itself back on the map of Europe.â\n\nFrom his strategic viewpoint, Hajnal sees certain clubs in nearby countries as shining examples, starting with Dinamo Zagreb, one of the sides they surprised in this yearâs knockout rounds. âWeâre competing with Dinamo, letâs say, but I know they can spend much more money on player salaries. They also get more revenue from selling players at the moment, so we hope to catch up in the future.\n\nâWith Slavia Praha and Sparta Praha, other top clubs from leagues in the surrounding countries, weâre still below them in terms of salary budget, but the challenge is to get this level. We want to continue in this way and be competitive, not just with money but by making the right decisions and working hard and efficiently in every aspect.â The signs are certainly good. For one thing, hell has already long vanished from the rear-view mirror\n\nâWeâve been to hell and brought it with us.â So reads the slogan, written in Hungarian, English and several other languages, beneath which the players of both teams pass on their way from the changing rooms to the pitch at FerencvÃ¡rosâs home stadium. It serves, first of all, as a message of warning.\n\nOpponents from DjugÃ¥rden, Dinamo Zagreb and Molde did not encounter hell as such at the start of this season, but their Champions League qualifying hopes all went up in smoke a few steps beyond those words. So too the 2-0 lead that Dynamo Kyiv held when Champions League group stage football returned to the FerencvÃ¡ros district of Budapest on 28 October, Franck Boliâs 90th-minute goal earning the Hungarian titleholders a point.\n\nFor the nationâs most successful and best-supported club, the reference to hell conveys something else entirely: a sense of the long and tortuous road travelled since their previous appearance in the group stage 25 years ago.\n\nâTwenty unstable yearsâ is how Andy Clark, a Scotsman resident in Hungary for more than two decades, describes a period which brought a series of financial crises and culminated in the clubâs enforced relegation to the second tier in 2006. âThey couldnât pay players, owed money to state companies and were refused a licence,â explains Clark, a season-ticket holder at the time and now covering the clubâs return to the Champions League for UEFA.com. âThere were some games where we had a bigger crowd at FerencvÃ¡ros than all of the top-division games put together.â\n\nThat huge supporter base â estimated at 50% of football fans in the country â also includes followers among the ethnic Hungarian populations in neighbouring Slovakia and Romania, who in ordinary times undertake long car journeys to attend home fixtures. In Clarkâs view, these supporters ask for one thing above all. âThey want you to sweat blood for the team. They had a defender in the 1990s, Tibor Simon, who said, âYou can play badly but never without heart.ââ\n\nThe late Simon â tragically killed in an assault outside a Budapest club in 2002 â was a member of the FerencvÃ¡ros line-up which, at the time of writing, posted the last victory by a Hungarian club in the Champions League group stage: 3-0 at Grasshoppers in September 1995. Simon played with a broken hand that night, among the highlights of a campaign which inspired a 25th-anniversary documentary film, The Team of Passions.\n\nâThey were a real team,â says current captain GergÅ Lovrencsics. âAfter watching that documentary us Hungarians understood that they did well because they stuck together.â A winning formula his side followed to a tee during qualifying. âI said some words as captain before the match [against Molde], but I wasnât really needed because I saw the fire in their eyes. We also played like a real team and this was the result. Itâs true weâve had to wait a long time for it, but we are back in the Champions League.â\n\nTo understand the place the 31-time national champions occupy in Hungarian sporting culture, it is important to consider their origins. FerencvÃ¡rosi Torna Club were established during the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1899, initially as a gymnastics club. Budapest was then predominantly German-speaking, and the clubâs nickname of Fradi comes from the German translation of FerencvÃ¡ros, namely Franzstadt.\n\nFradi were in the vanguard of footballâs growth in Hungary. They were the first club to open a purpose-built football stadium in 1911. That same year they went on a tour to Germany and England, losing only one of six matches as their enduring (if self-appointed) âTeam of the nationâ epithet was born.\n\nEarly success in Europe came with two victories in the Mitropa Cup â a forerunner to UEFAâs club competitions â with the second, in 1937 against Lazio, following six goals across the two legs of the final by GyÃ¶rgy SÃ¡rosi, who would captain Hungary to the next yearâs World Cup final. From that position of strength, FerencvÃ¡rosâs fortunes dipped after the Second World War. The Communist regime did not look favourably on this strongly nationalist club: among the impositions, they had to change their name â to ÃDOSZ and then Kinizsi â and their colours to red and white. Moreover, the deliberate dismantling of their 1948/49 title-winning team led to LÃ¡szlÃ³ Budai, ZoltÃ¡n Czibor and SÃ¡ndor Kocsis â all members of Hungaryâs great Mighty Magyars side â joining rivals HonvÃ©d, the then flourishing army team.\n\nSupporting FerencvÃ¡ros became a symbol that you were against the regime. When they reclaimed the title in 1962/63, their first for 14 years, it inspired a popular chant aimed at JÃ¡nos KÃ¡dÃ¡r, leader of the Hungarian Communists: âFerencvÃ¡ros are champions. How do you like that, JÃ¡nos KÃ¡dÃ¡r?â\n\nThat title was the cue for the clubâs golden era in Europe, spearheaded by FlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert. Joint-top scorer at the 1962 World Cup, Albert won the 1967 Ballon DâOr. In between, he helped his only club to their Inter-Cities Fairs Cup triumph, defeating Roma and Manchester United along the way before a 1-0 final victory against Juventus.\n\nMÃ¡tÃ© Fenyvesi grabbed the winner in Turin from a DezsÅ NovÃ¡k cross, though not all his team-mates noticed at the time. âFlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert and ZoltÃ¡n Varga arrived in the box as usual, but FlÃ³ri was pushed away by the defenders,â Fenyvesi recalls. âI was behind him so I was able to head the ball into the net. FlÃ³ri didnât realise Iâd scored so he started to argue with the ref. I had to shout, âFlÃ³ri, leave it, I scored â weâre in the lead!ââ\n\nFerencvÃ¡ros had more continental feats up their sleeves too, reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup the next season before returning to the Fairs Cup final in 1968. Liverpool and Athletic were both defeated home and away, though a 1-0 loss to Leeds United dashed their trophy hopes in the decider.\n\nFate had it that it was Albertâs son, FlÃ³riÃ¡n Albert Jr, who was the hero of their group stage campaign in 1995/96 â a run which pitted them against holders Ajax and Real Madrid, along with Grasshoppers. âOne of our eyes was crying while the other was laughing,â Albert says, recalling the response when the draw was made. He duly provided the high point with the goal that earned a 1-1 home draw with Madrid â something to celebrate after a 5-1 home loss to Ajax and 6-1 drubbing at the Santiago BernabÃ©u. âWe had an anniversary event [recently] to commemorate the journey. We qualified for the Champions League 30 years after my fatherâs team won the UEFA Cup.Â We were discussing that itâs been 25 years since then, so these might be mystical numbers.â\n\nSo it has proved and the wish now is for FerencvÃ¡ros to make Europe a regular fixture once again. Coached by the former Ukraine, Dynamo Kyiv and Tottenham Hotspur forward Serhiy Rebrov, the Hungarians reached the Europa League group stage in 2019/20 and are now scripting another feel good story. âThis development has been over the longer term, with the group stage of the Europa League and being very competitive there last season, and now making one more step forward,â says sporting director TamÃ¡s Hajnal, a ball boy during FerencvÃ¡rosâs last Champions League adventure. âIâm not saying weâre a Champions League team â for sure notâ but we want to be competitive and reach one of the group stages of the European competitions [each year]. This makes our club interesting for players too. You can sense it in the negotiations when you approach them.â\n\nSince politician GÃ¡bor Kubatov took over the club presidency in 2011, FerencvÃ¡ros have become an ever more attractive proposition. That was a significant year for more than one reason: FerencvÃ¡ros, the multi-sport organisation, succeeded in buying out the football clubâs departing English owner, Kevin McCabe, for the sum of â¬1.\n\nThe Hungarian state acquired from McCabe the land on which the stadium stands. A year later, FerencvÃ¡ros regained the merchandising and marketing rights that had been sold during an earlier era of missteps. By 2014, they had a new stadium, freshly opened on the same site as their two previous grounds.\n\nFerencvÃ¡rosâs return to prominence mirrors an overall renaissance for Hungarian football since the election in 2010 of SÃ¡ndor CsÃ¡nyi, a billionaire banker, as president of the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ). First came the hosting of the Under-19 EURO in 2014. Then, in 2019, the Womenâs Champions League final was played at FerencvÃ¡ros Stadion. This year, the rebuilt PuskÃ¡s ArÃ©na staged the UEFA Super Cup, and four EURO 2020 matches will follow there next summer. At grassroots level, a pitch-building project has helped double the number of registered players.\n\nWhatever happens to FerencvÃ¡ros this season, the challenge is to sustain their success. Skipper Lovrencsics reflects: âFerencvÃ¡ros is everything. It has a great history, it fights to achieve big things that are similar to my goals. Building a club is hard work. The ambition of doing well in Europe again is true to its tradition, and FerencvÃ¡ros wants to put itself back on the map of Europe.â\n\nFrom his strategic viewpoint, Hajnal sees certain clubs in nearby countries as shining examples, starting with Dinamo Zagreb, one of the sides they surprised in this yearâs knockout rounds. âWeâre competing with Dinamo, letâs say, but I know they can spend much more money on player salaries. They also get more revenue from selling players at the moment, so we hope to catch up in the future.\n\nâWith Slavia Praha and Sparta Praha, other top clubs from leagues in the surrounding countries, weâre still below them in terms of salary budget, but the challenge is to get this level. We want to continue in this way and be competitive, not just with money but by making the right decisions and working hard and efficiently in every aspect.â The signs are certainly good. For one thing, hell has already long vanished from the rear-view mirror\n\nIn his short time as a coach, Serhiy Rebrov has already amassed more trophies than many managers will win during their entire careers. The 46-year-old led Dynamo Kyiv to back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016 and then did the same with FerencvÃ¡ros in 2019 and 2020.\n\nâSerhiy Rebrov brought something to the team which was not there before â a lot of attention to every detail,â explains Sporting director TamÃ¡s Hajnal. âHe brought good organisation, good structure. The roles are very clearly defined so everybody knows and understands what he has to do in possession, out of possession, in the transition phases of the game, and he repeats it again and again.â\n\nCaptain GergÅ Lovrencsics has felt the Ukrainianâs impact on his game and the teamâs. âWeâve improved a lot â especially tactically, but also physically. When Serhiy arrived, he started to tell us about different tactical variations, from the goalkeeper to the forwards. He explained where each player should be in different situations.\n\nâAt first this was strange and new. Before he arrived Iâd been playing as a right-sided midfielder for a year. Iran up then came back. I wasnât always where I should have been and I didnât play as well as I wanted to. I made a lot more mistakes.\n\nâWhen the coach arrived he just told me, âWhen your opponent has the ball you go down there, next to the line, use the whole width of the pitch. If you are further in, you will be attacked quicker, but if you are further out youâll get more time.â He has helped me a lot, but I can speak for the others, because he has helped all of them. He is tactically prepared for everything. Heâs always preparing for the next opponent. This is the biggest improvement the team has undergone.â\n\nIn his short time as a coach, Serhiy Rebrov has already amassed more trophies than many managers will win during their entire careers.
