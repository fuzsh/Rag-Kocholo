Of the Romanesque and Gothic constructions Office Savings Bank\n\nbuilt during the reign of the first Magyar kings, little survived the\n\nMongol invasion of the 13th century. Of the Renaissance era, only\n\nremnants and reconstructions remain, though there is more of the\n\nBaroque period to admire. The Secession (the struggle for a national\n\nstyle at the end of the 19th century) mirrored the nation’s political fight\n\nfor independence. After World War II, Soviet utilitarianism took over,\n\nand surrounded fine cities with its unsightly apartment blocks.\n\nRoman (AD 200–450) Aquincum, originally a heavily fortified military\n\nbase, was home to as many as 40,000 people in its\n\nThe first master builders in Hungary were the heyday at the end of the 2nd century.\n\nRomans, much of whose capital, Aquincum, in\n\nthe suburbs of present-day Budapest, survives.

Ceramic tiles were also used to\n\ngreat loads to be supported by giant pillars. decorate concrete walls.\n\nColonnades were often used to\n\nmask heavy, load-bearing walls.\n\nRomanesque and Gothic (1000–1450)\n\nAlso referred to as Norman architecture, the Romanesque period was one of the most energetic\n\nphases of church building ever witnessed in Europe. On becoming king of Hungary, István ordered\n\na church to be built for every 10 villages in the land. Many followed the same construction model,\n\nwith a large single nave supported by round arches known as piers – the medieval equivalent of\n\nRoman columns. Towers did not become commonplace until the 12th century, as superior masonry\n\nfacilitated their construction. Romanesque façades were usually simple, and it was only as architects\n\nbecame more confident in the 13th century that more decorative elements such as rose and\n\nstained-glass windows, flying buttresses and gargoyles appeared, creating a new style that would\n\nbecome known as Gothic. The 13th-century church at Ják, with its exquisite porta speciosa\n\n(a stepped portal of rounded, barrel and pointed arches) is one of the finest remaining examples\n\nof medieval architecture in Europe, and marks the transition from Romanesque style to Gothic.\n\nThe tower is four-sided at its base\n\nand octagonal at the top.\n\nThe portal was Mátyás Church is considered\n\nrecreated using to be a Gothic masterpiece.\n\nfragments of However, little of what\n\nthe original.\n\nremains today is part\n\nof the 14th-century Gothic arches precede cross-ribbed\n\noriginal, having vaults in Esztergom Cathedral.\n\nbeen extensively\n\nrebuilt in Neo-\n\nGothic style in\n\nthe 1880s.\n\nA PORTRAIT OF HUNGARY  29\n\nRenaissance and Baroque (1450–1800)\n\nRenaissance architecture was a successful attempt to incorporate the grandeur of Rome into\n\nthe contemporary world. Led by the Italians Brunelleschi and Bramante, the concept of art for art’s\n\nsake became paramount, with buildings being designed around their\n\nfaçades. In Hungary the movement found royal favour from King Mátyás,\n\nwho was greatly influenced by his Italian wife, Beatrice. The Hungarian\n\nRenaissance was brought to an end by the Turks, who destroyed many\n\nof its greatest achievements.\n\nAfter they were expelled from\n\nHungary in 1690, the Baroque\n\nera began, characterized by\n\ngrand designs which reflected\n\nSarospatak Castle’s a shift away from the proto-\n\n15th-century humanism of the Renaissance.\n\nRenaissance tower Most Baroque mansions were\n\nis a copy of Palazzo built to showcase the wealth The elaborate Bishop’s Palace in Szekes-\n\nVecchio in Florence. of their patrons. fehérvár is representative of Baroque style.\n\nNeo-Classical (1800–90) Secession (1890–1930)\n\nIn Hungary, the Neo-Classical movement was The Secessionist era saw an ornamental style\n\nconsidered a statement of intent: that this of art (also known as Art Nouveau) flourish\n\nwas a heroic nation worthy of statehood. in Europe at the end of the 19th century.
