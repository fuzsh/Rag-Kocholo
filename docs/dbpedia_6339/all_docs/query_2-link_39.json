The journal’s Academic Editors select a small number of published articles that they consider will be of particular interest to our readers or important in their respective fields of research. We welcome you to read the Editor’s Choice Papers in the Section “Companion Animals”, a curated list of high-quality articles from 2022 to 2023 in this Section. The list of selected papers can be viewed below.\n\n1. “Nutritional Composition and Untargeted Metabolomics Reveal the Potential of Tetradesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oceanica as Valuable Nutrient Sources for Dogs”\n\nby Ana R. J. Cabrita, Joana Guilherme-Fernandes, Inês M. Valente, Agostinho Almeida, Sofia A. C. Lima, António J. M. Fonseca and Margarida R. G. Maia\n\nAnimals 2022, 12(19), 2643; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12192643\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/19/2643\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nFood security is an increasing concern, and the environmental impact of pet food production is widely debated. The authors of the above study identified a novel, nutritionally balanced food suitable for dogs that can be made from microalgae.\n\n2. “Babesia gibsoni Infection in Dogs—A European Perspective”\n\nby Oliwier Teodorowski, Marcin Kalinowski, Dagmara Winiarczyk, Banu Dokuzeylül, Stanisław Winiarczyk and Łukasz Adaszek\n\nAnimals 2022, 12(6), 730; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12060730\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/6/730\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nThe authors of the above review report confirmed cases of Babesia gibsoni infection in dogs in Europe. Most of these cases occurred in dog fighting breeds, especially American Pit Bull Terriers or related breeds, suggesting a breed-specific predisposition. Furthermore, rather than a tick bite, the main transmission route could be via wound contact with infected blood. The course of the disease is severe, and diagnosis and treatment are a challenge. The authors point out that B. gibsoni should be considered a possible emerging parasite in Europe.\n\n3. “Expansion of Canine Heartworm in Spain”\n\nby José Alberto Montoya-Alonso, Rodrigo Morchón, Sara Nieves García-Rodríguez, Yaiza Falcón-Cordón, Noelia Costa-Rodríguez, Jorge Isidoro Matos, Iván Rodríguez Escolar and Elena Carretón\n\nAnimals 2022, 12(10), 1268; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12101268\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/10/1268\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nGlobal warming favors the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as canine heartworm. The above study focuses on the epidemiology of heartworm in dogs and the impact of climate change in Spain. The study results show the expansion of canine heartworm in Spain, especially in northern regions where it has not been previously reported, such as the Basque Country. In some regions where the presence of Dirofilaria immitis has already been observed, its prevalence was not notable, probably because of the implementation of preventive measures in the dog population. The authors suggest that global warming, the mobility of animal reservoirs, and the modification of the landscape with high edaphic availability of water or stagnant water that provides suitable conditions for the presence of the culicid vectors have an impact on the expansion of D. immitis in Spain. The study results evidence the importance of the implementation of prophylactic programs in the canine population to control infection.\n\n4. “Characterization of the Fecal and Mucosa-Associated Microbiota in Dogs with Chronic Inflammatory Enteropathy”\n\nby David Díaz-Regañón, Mercedes García-Sancho, Alejandra Villaescusa, Ángel Sainz, Beatriz Agulla, Mariana Reyes-Prieto, Antonio Rodríguez-Bertos and Fernando Rodríguez-Franco\n\nAnimals 2023, 13(3), 326; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13030326\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/3/326\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nDisturbance of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) is important in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in dogs (and other species). However, most studies have only studied dysbiosis in fecal samples, which may not reflect what is happening in the small intestine where inflammation predominates. The authors of the above study compared the microbiota in the feces and duodenal biopsies of dogs with intestinal inflammation. The results showed dysbiosis in both areas compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the results demonstrated greater changes in fecal samples compared to duodenal biopsies. These findings suggest that analysis of the fecal microbiota, which is much more accessible, can reflect dysbiosis within the small intestine.\n\n5. “When and Why Cats Are Returned to Shelters”\n\nby Vivian Mundschau and Malini Suchak\n\nAnimals 2023, 13(2), 243; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13020243\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/2/243\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nThe authors of the above study report the return-to-shelter rate of adopted cats of just under 12% within 4 years of adoption with approximately half being returned within the first month. The risk of being returned was found to increase with the age of the cat at the time of adoption and if there was a history of biting and decrease if the cats had spent time in foster care. Short-term returns were mainly due to unacceptable cat behaviour, but the reason for cats being returned after more than 30 days was mainly due to the owner’s personal reasons. An increased in-depth understanding of these reasons and the timing of returns can increase the likelihood of developing strategies to keep cats in their new homes.\n\n6. “Understanding the Factors Influencing Cat Containment: Identifying Opportunities for Behaviour Change”\n\nby Gemma C. Ma and Lynette J. McLeod\n\nAnimals 2023, 13(10), 1630; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13101630\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/10/1630\n\nEditor’s Comments:\n\nMa and McLeod’s interesting study into cat containment practices in New South Wales, Australia, adopted the Capability–Opportunity–Motivation (COM) Behavioural Model to determine the importance of these COM factors along with other situational factors in explaining the cat containment behaviours of cat owners. Owners not currently containing their pet cats can be divided into six profiles according to the COM themes, and this knowledge can be used to design specific strategies to encourage behaviour change and increase cat containment. The authors identified that encouraging a night curfew would be a useful first step towards 24-hour containment.\n\nName: Mediterranean Life Sciences Union Annual Meeting (MedLIFE-24)\n\nDate: 8–10 December 2024\n\nPlace: Congress Center of Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey/Hybrid\n\nSubmission deadline: 31 August 2024\n\nWebsite: https://2024.med-life.org/index.php\n\nIt is a pleasure and an honor to invite you to attend the Mediterranean Life Sciences Union Annual Meeting (MedLIFE-24), which will be held in person and online from 8 to 10 December 2024, at the Congress Center of Istanbul Technical University. Researchers from all fields of life sciences, both in the Mediterranean area and throughout the world, are invited to present and discuss their most recent research discoveries at MedLIFE-24 and to publish their findings in the MedLIFE-24 proceedings.\n\nAfter the remarkable successes of the Mediterranean Geosciences Union Annual Meetings (MedGU-21 in Istanbul, MedGU-22 in Marrakech, and MedGU-23 in Istanbul) that were aimed mainly at highlighting the contributions of the Earth Sciences community in addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it became obvious that there is a need to expand this global scale initiative to create extensive and comprehensive international annual meetings for other science unions in order to connect researchers and enable them to present and discuss their most recent findings.\n\nWith this objective in mind and as a continuation of the tremendous success of the MedGU Annual Meetings, which have attracted overwhelming interest with over 4000 abstract submissions from 95 countries, MedLIFE-24 will be organized to provide a forum for life scientists from the Mediterranean region and all over the world. Researchers, particularly those in the early stages of their careers, can be informed about the latest studies and discuss their latest unpublished findings with experts from the wide-ranging fields of life sciences.\n\nConnecting and communicating the impact of life science research on sustainability is critical for shaping and influencing the future of life sciences, including training next-generation life scientists, accelerating scientific innovation, and advancing our understanding of life, the planet, and beyond. In this regard, life sciences should continue to play their specific role in achieving the SDGs. For example, the life sciences have been used in the health, medicine, and pharmaceutical industries to improve people’s quality of life. In addition, several SDGs directly or indirectly address the water–food–energy nexus, which has been a focal point for life scientists throughout history. Life scientists are, therefore, critical to delivering the SDGs. Their vast knowledge of the function and interactions of living organisms and their environments, together with their ability to translate this knowledge into tools to inform policy and practice, may help to enlighten many important areas and inform many key aspects of sustainable development.\n\nIn this context, MedLIFE-24 seeks to highlight and strengthen the synergies and links between various domains of life science and the UN SDGs. For example, SDG 3, “ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being”, is one of the 17 goals and targets that is especially pertinent to life science. It represents the core of efforts towards sustainability in the field. Given their traditional focus on “purposive” research, life scientists have adopted and continue to pursue integrative approaches, for example, by complementing perspectives from natural and technical disciplines with those from the environmental and social sciences. They can thus offer expertise in integrating knowledge from the natural, technical, and social sciences to provide solutions for many of the global challenges posed by sustainable development.\n\nMedLIFE-24, through engagement by life scientists in academia, research, industry, government, and civil society, working across sectors and in close partnership with other disciplines (e.g., engineering, earth science, environmental sciences, and social sciences), can inform many key aspects of sustainable development. MedLIFE-24 will host initiatives that allow life scientists to conduct transdisciplinary research with stakeholders. This could contribute to the development of theory since integrating academic and experiential knowledge from practitioners is crucial to achieving the transformation towards sustainability.\n\nDuring MedLIFE-24, prominent speakers will be invited to give Plenaries. Moreover, we are planning a rich Conference Program, including regular and Special Sessions, a Social Program, and an Excursion to Cappadocia, where participants can take a little time out to explore the wonders of Turkey and discover new experiences and sensations.\n\nAs with the previous MedGU Annual Meetings (see SpringerLink), the research findings presented at MedLIFE-24 will be published in the conference proceedings by Springer in the IEREK Interdisciplinary Series for Sustainable Development ASTI Book Series (indexed in Scopus/SCImago) and in Special Issues; this is in order to encourage greater scientific cooperation and to open doors to new and enriching collaborations between life scientists on opposite shores of the Mediterranean and from all over the world.\n\nMedLIFE-24 is looking forward to welcoming you to Istanbul. Your participation, in person or virtually, will support MedLIFE’s mission of ensuring a sustainable future for humanity in the region and the planet.\n\nJoin us for a memorable experience!\n\nThe MedLIFE-24 Steering & Organizing Committees\n\nMDPI has been a strong proponent of the open access publishing model right from the beginning. As one of the pioneering fully open access publishers, we firmly believe that unrestricted access to research findings forms the foundation for better transparency, efficiency, and quality control across all scientific disciplines.\n\nIn December 2022, we reached a significant milestone by surpassing one million articles published. That is one million articles freely available to all, to circulate and build upon!\n\nOffering free and immediate access to scientific papers empowers scientists to examine, validate, replicate, and expand upon existing results. This not only helps prevent redundancy and optimizes how resources are used but also paves the way for innovative new approaches.\n\nThe International Open Access Week takes place from 23 to 29 October 2023, providing a unique opportunity to connect the global movement towards open sharing and open science with the progress of policy transformations at the local level.\n\nOur goal, during Open Access Week as well as throughout the year, is to offer resources for educating people about the benefits of open access publishing. The MDPI Blog offers a wealth of information around open access and open science.\n\nPromoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration\n\nOpen access publishing embodies the fundamental values of democratizing knowledge and fostering global accessibility. It aims to break down barriers that have traditionally limited access to scholarly work, ensuring that knowledge is available to all, regardless of their financial or institutional affiliations.\n\nDiscounts are part of our commitment to ensuring there are diverse pathways to Open Access publishing for researchers worldwide. MDPI supports scientific communities in several different ways.\n\nOne of the key strengths of open access publishing lies in its ability to facilitate interdisciplinary research. By removing paywalls and promoting the sharing of knowledge across disciplines, OA encourages collaboration and innovation. Researchers from diverse fields can access and build upon each other's work, fostering a holistic approach to addressing complex global challenges.\n\nFunders' policies are getting aligned with open science\n\nGovernments, institutions, and funding agencies have recognized the transformative potential of open access and have implemented policies to promote it. These policies often mandate that publicly funded research should be made openly accessible. Such initiatives have accelerated the growth of open access repositories and journals, reinforcing the commitment to open access principles. Check our spotlights on OA policies in the US, EU and China.\n\nOpen access publishing is continually evolving, with innovative and community-driven models and technologies shaping its future. Initiatives like \"Plan S\" and \"cOAlition S\" promote the adoption of OA publishing from the national funders’ perspective by requiring grantees to publish their research openly. A new policy announced by the US administration last year requires that, as of January 2026, all US federally funded research be made freely and immediately available after publication.\n\nAdditionally, preprint servers such as MDPI's Preprints.org, which allow researchers to share their findings before formal peer review, have gained popularity, enhancing the speed at which new knowledge is disseminated. The rise of blockchain technology is also being explored to ensure transparency and authenticity in scholarly publishing.\n\nFor more than twenty years, open access scholarly publishing has been revolutionizing academia by promoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration. Its support for interdisciplinary research, evolving policies, and innovative practices all contribute to its growing influence in the global research community. As open access continues to expand, it holds the potential to democratize knowledge, advance science, and drive positive societal change.\n\nMDPI is proud to be a leader in the transition to open access.\n\nIt is a privilege to work with animals, but this is particularly true if we use animals in research. Our work with research animals is generally conducted on the assumption that the benefits arising from the work outweigh the harms placed upon the animals. In the context of Animals, much of the published work addresses animal welfare, work that in many cases provides solutions that show clear improvements for the animals’ quality of life. Given that most of the research published in our journal involves animals, this brings a responsibility on the part of the scientists that submit their work to us to ensure that the work is conducted to the highest ethical standards.\n\nWe do also recognize that using animals as research subjects is especially contentious given that some people prefer that no animals are used for research, whereas others, including many of the scientists who have published in Animals, condone the use of animals, regardless of the purpose of the research study.\n\nFaced with these views, somehow, we have to ensure that animals are ethically cared for. The easiest research to defend is the one from which the animals themselves are likely to benefit, testing a cure for an illness that they have acquired, for example. Research in which animals of the same species may benefit, but not the actual animals involved, is easier to defend than if only other species, especially humans, are likely to benefit. Much animal research only has the human end user, manager, or consumer in mind to benefit. These considerations of the beneficiary of the research must be taken into account in any ethical evaluation of whether the work should be allowed to proceed.\n\nHow does Animals decide whether the ethical standards used in an experiment were acceptable? As a starting point, we ask that all authors, if they work in a jurisdiction that has an animal ethics review system, seek ethical approval before engaging in the animal-based work. We do recognize that not all researchers, including those working in developing countries, have access to an ethical oversight body. Given that Animals is also committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity it would be unethical, and discriminatory, if we prevented such scientists from submitting their work in the absence of an appropriate certifying body. All articles submitted with or without ethical approval are expected to conform with ARRIVE guidelines. Those submitted without ethical approval are expected to request retrospective approval, or if an approval was not required, authors are requested to provide a certificate from the body that shows that ethical approval was not necessary for this study. For those who are able to reasonably justify that there is no approving body available, this will be checked by the Editorial Office. The authors should fill in the ARRIVE checklist and include clear justification of their research in their manuscript. The checklist, together with the manuscript, will be evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief. The checklist will be available in the Supplementary Material of the published article.\n\nWe also recognize that there is variation across jurisdictions as to whether a specific animal-based study requires ethical oversight or not. For example, observational studies on animals, that do not risk their welfare, require evaluation in some jurisdictions but not others. Other challenges also exist, such as understaffing of committees, many of which are often staffed by volunteers who have limited time to review applications. Even if there are pan-national standards that require such work to be evaluated, e.g., the EU or the World Animal Health (OIE) standards, researchers may believe that national standards do not require the research to be submitted for approval. Lastly, even when subjected to review by a local ethics committee, the standards which they adopt can vary considerably between committees and may even depend on the membership of the committee. Many committees include animal scientists, veterinarians, with some also including members from the institution that do not work with animals, members of the public, and members of animal advocacy groups. However, in some approval processes only government scientists are involved. Each of these scenarios brings about its own unique set of challenges, including committee decisions that are inappropriate because of personal relationships between animal scientists within an organisation, good or bad, power issues between individual committee members, or inadequate requirements or training of members of the committee. In many jurisdictions, decisions are based on a utilitarian assessment of harm vs. benefit, i.e., is any harm caused to the animals superseded by benefits to other animals, or as is often the case benefits to humans. These trade-offs are often difficult to judge, and the currency is not always clear. Critics of this approach argue that, given that animals do not have a choice in their involvement, this approach is invalid. Interestingly, in human ethics evaluation, humans, or their designates, must almost always provide consent. Animals respects these differing values and encourages future discussion within the scientific community on this topic.\n\nA common failing of the committee approach is that the members of the committee, and particularly the scientists, focus not on whether the study should proceed, but on the scientific methods proposed to be used. Scientists often fail to take into account the commonly held viewpoint that some animal research should not be allowed because of the animals’ right to avoid the research which severely compromises their welfare.\n\nThese difficulties in the “approval by committee” for animal research have encouraged us to adopt even more stringent and standard approaches when evaluating the work that is presented to us. As well as requiring animal ethics approval if it can reasonably be given, we require authors, reviewers, and editors to consider and evaluate for themselves whether the work is ethical. Animals is committed to aid in the development of training to help us achieve this in an equitable way. At all stages of the work the ethical impact on the animals used must be considered, but especially so during the planning stage. If it is not, then our editors, and hopefully reviewers, will challenge it. To our readers, please note that many submitted manuscripts have been rejected because of animal ethics issues, but for the animals involved in those studies it was too late, and we regret that they were subjected to unnecessary harms.\n\nWhoever benefits from the research, the standards of animal welfare should be at the highest possible level; we owe this to the animals used in the pursuit of science. We recognize that this may result in welfare provisions in experimental settings that are above those of the same animals kept for other purposes (i.e., for food production). It is in no-one’s interest to conduct research with laboratory animals whose welfare is poor, not the animals, not the scientists, because the results will not reflect good conditions, and not the members of the public, who are often demonstrably opposed to the use of animals in such research. As animal scientists, therefore, it is desirable for us to do research that benefits the animals, and in this respect it is Animals’ policy not to accept any submissions where animals are used as a model for any type of research where humans are the only beneficiary.\n\nAcknowledgments: I am grateful to the Associate Editors (Prof. Dr. Marina Von Keyserlingk, Dr. Gareth Pearce and Dr. Mandy Paterson) for their comments.\n\nMDPI Books recently released Book Builder, a new online tool to conveniently arrange, design and produce an eBook from any content published in MDPI journals.

This prominent event, held for the first time in Africa, will include many illustrious South African and international experts, such as Her Excellency Graça Machel (Sustainable Development Advocate for the United Nations, Mozambique), Joyene Isaacs (HoD Agriculture Western Cape Government), Jeffrey Sachs (Columbia University, USA), Max Bergman (SRaM, University of Basel), Mark New (Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Cape Town), Frans Swanepoel (FutureAfrica, University of Pretoria) and Francis Petersen (Vice-Chancellor-designate, University of the Free State). The Forum will provide a stage for national and international debates on sustainability in South Africa, the African continent, and about international perspectives on sustainability. It brings together researchers and representatives from government and the business sector to discuss a wide-ranging set of issues associated with sustainability, including food security, water and energy scarcity, mining, poverty reduction, climate change, and urbanisation.\n\nThe next few decades will be marked by profound changes in the relationships between global economics, national societies, and the environment. We have entered what some call the Anthropocene, an age in which human activity dominates the climate and the environment. These changes will have numerous consequences on societies around the globe. South Africa and Africa will play a central role, for better or worse, in creating opportunities and risks during these changing times as Africa is profoundly influencing and being influenced by global developments.\n\nThe adoption of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015 was accompanied by what insiders considered an optimism they have not experienced in relation to UN resolutions before. The relative efficiency in the drafting, the lack of trenches between East and West, or between North and South, and the unanimity of support of the 193 countries speak volumes. In stark contrast, sustainability seems to go against a changing economic and political tide, where waves of nationalism and protectionism from some of the most powerful countries risk the wellbeing of the rest of the world. The 6th World Sustainability Forum will enable fruitful exchanges, which sensitise South African and international communities to the global urgency and specifics of sustainability.\n\nThe Forum will showcase the work of internationally renowned researchers and include more than 150 presentations. During the conference dinner, the World Sustainability Award, associated with a US$ 100 000 prize, will be announced, as well as the Emerging Sustainability Leader Award, associated with a US$ 10 000 prize. The prizes are sponsored by the MDPI Sustainability Foundation and Sustainability, an academic open access journal by MDPI. The World Sustainability Forum is preceded by the Postgraduate Forum on Sustainability, which will introduce more than 100 young scholars from South Africa and the African continent to sustainability research. Both events are organized and sponsored by the University of Cape Town, the University of the Western Cape, the University of Basel, MDPI, and by the National Research Foundation of South Africa.\n\nContacts:\n\nScientific Matters: Prof Manfred Max Bergman, Social Research and Methodology Group (SRaM), University of Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]\n\nPress Accreditation and General Enquiries: Mr Matthias Burkhalter, MDPI AG, Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]; Tel. +41 61 683 77 34\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n#WSF2017SA"
