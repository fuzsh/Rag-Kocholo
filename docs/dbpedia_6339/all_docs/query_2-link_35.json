        "text": "Archaeology and archaeological cultural heritage should be reachable and accessible to different profiles including to persons with special needs: people with impaired vision or hearing and intellectual disabilities. These categories have been largely denied access to their archaeological heritage and they have been deprived of the possibility to fully experience their past. The aim of this project is to create a strategic partnership in the field of higher education with the purpose to create and share innovative practices in the digitalization of the cultural heritage and its accessibility for persons with disabilities. The general goal of this project is to bring archaeological cultural heritage closer to the public, including different categories of the population, preferably through on-line courses. Through the project activities the awareness of the value and importance of archaeological heritage among the general public will be raised and the field of archaeology and conservation science will be popularized. Reaching these goals, we shall draw on the experience of our partners from European countries with longer archaeological traditions and, in doing so, we shall foster a sense of common European identity.\n\nThe aim of the AD HOC project (Erasmus+ KA203 project) is to create a strategic partnership in the field of higher education with the purpose to create and share innovative practices in the digitalization of the cultural heritage and its accessibility for persons with disabilities. The general goal of this project is to bring archaeological cultural heritage closer to the public, including different categories of the population, preferably through online courses. Through the project activities the awareness of the value and importance of archaeological heritage among the general public is raised and the field of archaeology and conservation science is popularized. The innovative value of the AD HOC «Accessible and Digitalized Heritage of Culture» is in its accessibility for disadvantaged learners as well as students with disabilities. Because of this, we chose the second horizontal priority in the area of High education. With our project activities we work on building inclusive higher education systems. The objectives of this project are also aligned with the horizontal priority building inclusive higher education systems. With the creation of an accessible OER for cultural heritage, we will implement institutionally based strategies for inclusion and equal opportunities for all, including disadvantaged groups. The new and innovative OER will be accessible for diverse learners and it will be adjusted to their learning types. Within this study, we decided on a mixed method research, on a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. The research subject in this study was oriented towards defining least accessible archeological sites in North Macedonia, Greece, Italy and Slovenia. In order to do that we conducted a desktop analysis in all four countries participants in the project. Here, the insights of students with disabilities were of enormous value. Hence, we decided to incorporate a quantitative field research as a continuation of this qualitative desktop study. With the compiled data and knowledge of this two approached we moved towards the research goal of this study – to define least accessible sites, to define the barriers for students with impaired hearing, impaired vision, physical disabilities and so on, and to create suggestions on how we can improve the archeological experience for these categories of persons with disabilities.\n\nVirtual archaeological landscapes of the Danube region (Danube´s Archaeological eLandscapes) is a project co-financed by the Interreg Danube Transnational programme. The project´s major goal is to regionally, nationally and internationally increase the visibility of the cultural heritage, and in particular the archaeological landscapes of the Danube region, making them more attractive for an integration into the region’s tourism offers. In order to achieve this goal, new technologies are employed throughout the project. Within the framework of the project, a strategy has been adopted by the partners from 10 countries of the Danube region. The strategy approaches the topic of archaeological heritage from an archaeological, social and a technological standpoint. By using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analyses conducted by the working groups, major challenges in the sector were defined, leading to two main strategy units. The first unit focuses on working processes from the archaeological discovery to a virtual visualisation, and the second on the potential of archaeological heritage in the digital world. To support the further adaptation and development of new technologies for the archaeological sector, the strategy concludes with 12 recommendations for heritage stakeholders. Priority lists are adopted for the implementation of the recommendations at national level for each participating country.\n\nPublic science communication is widely recognized as an expected and essential part of the scientific enterprise. Numerous skills and strategies are necessary to effectively communicate science and engage with multiple audiences (e.g., Mercer-Mapstone and Ketchell 2015), yet such competencies are often inadequately taught or absent in academic training of students throughout STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) disciplines (Brownell et al. 2013). For archaeologists, such public archaeology skills are especially critical in a wide range of professions-including academia, cultural resource management (CRM), agency, museum, and Tribal archaeology-yet we rarely are explicit in how we train students in preparation for varied archaeological careers and contexts. This essay addresses this curriculum gap, as well as public archaeology in higher education more generally. Public archaeology education is important, and it encompasses diverse undergraduate and graduate student audiences and contexts. We briefly review a spectrum of innovative and alternative approaches to teaching public archaeology in the classroom within a public science communication framework, which includes passive and active forms of learning, as well as creative \"dialoguebased\" models (active and creative learning through more open or two-way engagement) that facilitate public engagement with science (Mercer-Mapstone and Kuchel 2015:2; Besley and Tanner 2011). We conclude that engagement of diverse student audiences with multiple science communication pedagogies is critical both to the discipline and to improving equity in science. Instructor commitment can be substantial, but support at the institutional level-often lacking-is integral to addressing gaps in public archaeology curricula.\n\nA discriminating, multi-disciplinary knowledge is a necessary expertise that all the actors who operate in the management, conservation, and communication of Cultural Heritage (CH) must have. They are, therefore, expected to be seriously prepared in many fields. However, a proper training program for them, which effectively combines humanistic studies with scientific ones, is difficult to be arranged when there is lack of comprehensive perspective in the education system. This paper introduces the experiences of the postgraduate programs that were established for many years at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. Through a calibrated mixture of theoretical background and practical applications taught by high-profile scholars, those programs proved to be effective in the preparation of figures later dealing with the CH at different levels. The clear organization of those specialized lectures, the innovation introduced with hands-on practical case studies and the adoption of s...\n\nArchaeology is traditionally a hands-on, in-person discipline when it comes to formal and informal instruction; however, more and more we are seeing the application of blended and online instruction and outreach implemented within our discipline. To this point, much of the movement in this direction has been related to a greater administrative emphasis on filling university classrooms, as well as the increasing importance of public outreach and engagement when it comes to presenting our research. More recently, we have all had to adjust our activities and interactions in reaction to physical distancing requirements during a pandemic. Whether in a physical classroom or online, archaeologists must learn to properly leverage digital technology in order to create enthusiastic, engaging, respectful, and accessible (from-place and in-place) learning environments. This article brings together scholars who are learning to do just that. We apply a usable and easily navigated framework for ar...\n\nThis volume seeks to document and explore the significant change in the relationship of Museums with collections of the Ancient World and their audiences. The volume establishes a new approach to the study of public archaeology as a discipline and application within Museums, by bringing together the voices and experiences of museum professionals (curators, conservators and researchers) and public engagement professionals. Chapters in this volume present clear case-studies of the variety and diversity of public engagement projects conducted currently within European Museums and beyond. While the majority of case studies presented in the volume’s chapters stem from European Museum programmes, plenty of reference is made on parallel strategies and successful public engagement programmes outside Europe. Case studies within the volume provide important insights as to why public engagement programmes have developed in different ways between Europe and the Americas, as well as whether these differences may stem from different curatorial practices. Finally, a number of studies included in this volume point out that methodologies and practices of public engagement applied currently by Museums in or outside Europe, are rarely the subject of theoretical and methodological scrutiny, unlike other fields of study of the Ancient World or other social sciences. In summary, chapters within the book promise to contribute to the advancement of public engagement with the Ancient World, as well as to the advancement of public archaeology itself as a practice."
