        "text": "Bátor Tábor Foundation offers therapeutic recreation programs and camps for children with cancer or chronic illnesses. With your support, you can contribute to our effort to provide more than 1000 chronically ill children and their family members with the opportunity to participate for free in the fun and the moments of triumph and healing offered by Bátor Tábor every year.Bátor Tábor is a member of SeriousFun Children’s Network founded 25 years ago by Academy Award-winning actor Paul Newman.\n\nThe Foundation was set up to help talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds to develop their talents. To achieve this goal, a complex programme called the Life Path Programme has been developed to support children from the age of 10 to graduation. The Foundation's objectives are pursued in close cooperation with families and institutions, and with the active involvement of national and international volunteers. Our long-term activities are combined with individual talent development in addition to compensation for disadvantages.\n\nThe Federation is the sole organizer, controller and coordinator of shooting sport activities in Hungary for public benefit; it undertakes duties specified for national sports federations, represents the interests of the sport and its federation members, and participates in the activities of international sports organizations. It works under special licences specified by sports legislation. The Federation also aims to cultivate, improve and spread the culture of shooting sport.\n\nBOM – Foundation for Hungarian Sport has been established and run by the Budapest Olympics Movement, business entrepreneurs, sports representatives and non-govermental bodies with the aim of allocating resources to help top Hungarian athletes prepare for the next Olympic Games. On the long run, the organization aims to continue supporting Hungarian athletes so that their outstanding Olympic achievements may at a later time advance Hungary’s application for the role of organizing country of the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nIn 2014, the Hungarian Curling Federation had 11 member clubs. Our aim is to promote curling and organize competitions in Hungary. Curling is a Winter Olympics sport played on ice by teams of four. It’s a strategic team sport also known as “chess on ice”. Besides two historic sports clubs in Budapest, FTC and UTE, which have a sizeable curling section, Westbay Sport Club is among the most successful teams. In Hungary, there are currently 123 registered curlers, 30% of whom are junior athletes under 21."
