        "text": "The stigmatization of obesity among Gypsy and Hungarian children.\n\nPubMed\n\nPapp, IldikÃ³; TÃºry, Ferenc\n\n2013-06-01\n\nPrejudice against obese people has been widely confirmed in scientific papers. Therefore, recent studies have increasingly focused on investigating the individual and cultural factors related to attitudes towards obesity. Since there have been no comparative studies involving Gypsy people, our present research aimed at exploring the possible discrepancies in children's attitudes towards obese children between Gypsy and Hungarian cultures. Our survey included 247 children aged 9-16 (108 boys and 139 girls), of which 136 considered themselves Hungarian (55.1Â %), while 111 children (44.9Â %) claimed themselves as Gypsy. The subjects were asked to rank six male and six female figure drawings according to their preference. Each sequence of figure drawings included a healthy child, an obese child, and four drawings depicted children with disabilities. According to our results, the drawings portraying the healthy child figure were rated most preferable and those portraying the obese child figure the least preferable amongst the subjects regardless of gender and origin. However, the obese girl figures and boy figures were rated significantly more positively by Gypsy children than Hungarian children. Our results suggest that there is a difference in attitude towards obesity among Gypsy and Hungarian children. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further explore this phenomenon.\n\nMeasuring Computer Science Knowledge Level of Hungarian Students Specialized in Informatics with Romanian Students Attending a Science Course or a Mathematics-Informatics Course\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKiss, Gabor\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAn analysis of Information Technology knowledge of Hungarian and Romanian students was made with the help of a self developed web based Informatics Test.

The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL 3.0 Cardiac Module was administered to 254 caregivers of children (aged 2-18 years) and to 195 children (aged 5-18 years) at a pediatric cardiology outpatient unit. A postal survey on a demographically group-matched sample of the general population with 525 caregivers of children (aged 2-18 years) and 373 children (aged 5-18 years) was conducted with the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale. Responses were described, compared over subgroups of subjects, and were used to assess practical utility, distributional coverage, construct validity, internal consistency, and inter-reporter agreement of the instrument. The moderate scale-level mean percentage of missing item responses (range 1.8-2.3%) supported the feasibility of the Generic Core Scales for general Hungarian children. Minimal to moderate ceiling effects and no floor effects were found on the Generic Core Scales. We observed stronger ceiling than floor effects in the Cardiac Module. Most of the scales showed satisfactory reliability with Cronbach's alpha estimates exceeding 0.70. Generally, moderate to good agreement was found between self- and parent proxy-reports in the patient and in the comparison group (intraclass correlation coefficient range 0.52-0.77), but remarkably low agreement in the perceived physical appearance subscale in the age group 5-7 years (0.18) and for the treatment II scale (problems on taking heart medicine) scale of the Cardiac Module in children aged 8-12 years (0.39). Assessing the construct validity of the questionnaires, statistically significant difference was found between the patient group and the comparison group only in the Physical Functioning Scale scores (p = 0.003) of the child self-report component, and in Physical (p = 0.022), Emotional, (p = 0\n\nOnline Testing of Hungarian Children's Prosocial Behavior\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZsolnai, AnikÃ³; Kasik, LÃ¡szlÃ³\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of our cross-sectional investigation was to explore prosocial behavior at the ages of 9, 11, and 13, and to reveal associations between this social behavior and some background variables such as age, gender, and parents' educational attainment.

In April 2005, we conducted a survey of mobile phone ownership and use among fourth grade school children in three Hungarian cities. From 24 schools, 1301 student filled out a short, self-administered questionnaire on basic demographics, mobile phone ownership, pattern of mobile phone use, and after-school activities. Overall, 989 students (76%) owned a mobile phone. Three hundred thirteen students (24%) used a mobile phone daily to make phone calls, and an additional 427 students (33%) used mobile phones for phone calls at least several times per week. Sixty-six students (5%) sent text messages daily and an additional 308 students (24%) sent text messages at least several times per week. Girls, children with no siblings, children who were members of a sport club, and children who played computer games daily were more likely to own and use mobile phones regularly. A higher number of socially disadvantaged children in a class predicted lower likelihood of regular mobile phone use among children. Our results suggest that mobile phone ownership and regular use is highly prevalent among school children in Hungary. Due to rapid changes in ownership patterns follow up surveys will be required to obtain information on temporal trends and changes in mobile phone ownership and pattern of use among school children.

A total of 114 children from 47 family day care centers wore an accelerometer for the duration of their time in care. Time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA was calculated using previously validated cut points. Children accumulated 5.8 Â± 3.2 minutes of MVPA and 10.4 Â± 4.4 minutes of total PA per hour of attendance. Boys exhibited significantly higher levels of PA than girls. Among healthy weight children, 4- and 5-year-olds exhibited significantly higher levels of PA than 2- and 3-year-olds. Overweight and obese 4- and 5-year-olds exhibited significantly lower levels of PA than their healthy weight counterparts. Children attending family day care participate in low levels of PA during the child care day. The results highlight the need for effective programs to promote PA in family day care.

The authors conducted a systematic review to determine the factors that influence parental adherence to regular dental attendance for their children. The authors searched nine electronic databases to May 2013. They included quantitative and qualitative studies in which researchers examined factors influencing dental attendance in children 12 years or younger. The authors considered all emergency and nonemergency visits. They appraised methodological quality through the Health Evidence Bulletins Wales methodological quality assessment tool. The authors selected 14 studies for the systematic review. Researchers in these studies reported a variety of factors at the patient, provider and system levels that influenced dental attendance. Factors identified at the patient level included parents' education, socioeconomic status, behavioral beliefs, perceived power and subjective norms. At the provider level, the authors identified communication and professional skills. At the system level, the authors identified collaborations between communities and health care professionals, as well as a formal policy of referring patients from family physicians and pediatricians to dentists. Barriers to and facilitators of parents' adherence to regular dental attendance for their children should be identified and considered when formulating health promotion policies. Further research is needed to investigate psychosocial determinants of children's adherence to regular dental visits.\n\n[Validation of Hungarian Smartphone Deprivation Inventory (HSDI) with school children].\n\nPubMed\n\nCsibi, SÃ¡ndor; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Szabo, Attila\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones generates new habits and behaviors among the users, including schoolchildren. Advance technology-based applications, capturing interest and attention, influence cognitive focus and time spent with the device. Examination of these factors points toward the risk of addiction, as well as the deprivations sensations associated with the latter, that call for scholastic attention. The aim of this study was to validate a Hungarian Smartphone Deprivation Inventory (HSDI), to gauge the deprivation feelings and their severity in schoolchildren when they cannot access their device. A 9-item, 7-point, agree-disagree inventory was developed on the basis of an earlier exercise deprivation scale (Robbins and Joseph, 1985). The inventory was completed by 258 Hungarian schoolchildren (mean age=12.4 Â± SD = 1.71 years). The participants also completed the Hungarian version of the Brief Addiction to Smartphone Scale (BASS). An exploratory factor analysis of the HSDI yielded a single factor that accounted for 55.84 % of the variance. The internal consistency of the inventory was excellent (Cronbach's Î± = 0.90). Content validity of the HSDI was checked by comparing the scores of those scoring above and below the median on the BASS that yielded statistically significant differences (p < .001). The HSDI correlated statistically significantly with the BASS (r = .62, p < .001) as well as with the deprivation subscale of the BASS (r = .63, p < .001), which demonstrated the inventory's congruent validity. These findings show that the HSDI is a sensitive tool for measuring deprivation feelings related prevented smartphone access in schoolchildren.\n\n[Prospective study of children's perceptions of parental behavior: psychometric properties of the Hungarian version of the EMBU-C questionnaire].\n\nPubMed\n\nCsomortÃ¡ni, D ZoltÃ¡n\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPreliminary research findings show that the parental rearing behaviour has a basic effect on the psychosocial development of the child, moreover, the inadequate parenting is related to some psychopathology occurring in childhood and adulthood. One reason in the development of this research subject was the appearance of the questionnaires, which judge the quality of the parenting and its effects by the children's recollections. Recently, there are new prospective instruments to remove the memory biases. The aim of this study was to standardize on a Hungarian sample one of these instruments, EMBU-C, made for primary school aged children. Primary school aged children (7-12 year old) were examined (n=108). Beyond demographic data the item base of the EMBU-C and the STAIC inventory were filled up. It was demonstrated the four factor structure of the EMBU-C (the names of the factors are respectively: Emotional warmth, Rejection, Overprotection and Favouring subject). The internal consistency of the inventory was in accordance with the international data. The concurrent validity also was proved by the STAIC. The recorded data are in accordance to the adolescent and adult versions of the EMBU. The most important result is that the parental rejection and overprotection may be related to the children's anxiety symptoms. Another important result is that the primary school aged children are disposed to interpret the intrusion component of the parental overprotection as emotional warmth that differs from adolescent and adult results. The successful standardization of the EMBU-C in Hungarian sample has positive consequences both to the clinical work and the research attempts, because it allows the investigation of the parental correlates of childhood psychopathologies, as well as the comparison of the results between different cohorts and international samples.\n\nDeaf children attending different school environments: sign language abilities and theory of mind.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomasuolo, Elena; Valeri, Giovanni; Di Renzo, Alessio; Pasqualetti, Patrizio; Volterra, Virginia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe present study examined whether full access to sign language as a medium for instruction could influence performance in Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks. Three groups of Italian participants (age range: 6-14 years) participated in the study: Two groups of deaf signing children and one group of hearing-speaking children. The two groups of deaf children differed only in their school environment: One group attended a school with a teaching assistant (TA; Sign Language is offered only by the TA to a single deaf child), and the other group attended a bilingual program (Italian Sign Language and Italian). Linguistic abilities and understanding of false belief were assessed using similar materials and procedures in spoken Italian with hearing children and in Italian Sign Language with deaf children. Deaf children attending the bilingual school performed significantly better than deaf children attending school with the TA in tasks assessing lexical comprehension and ToM, whereas the performance of hearing children was in between that of the two deaf groups. As for lexical production, deaf children attending the bilingual school performed significantly better than the two other groups. No significant differences were found between early and late signers or between children with deaf and hearing parents.\n\nDaycare attendance and risk for respiratory morbidity among young very low birth weight children.\n\nPubMed\n\nHagen, Erika W; Sadek-Badawi, Mona; Palta, Mari\n\n2009-11-01\n\nDaycare attendance and very low birth weight (VLBW, < or =1,500 g) are associated with respiratory morbidity during childhood. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether daycare attendance is associated with even higher risk for respiratory problems among VLBW children. We hypothesized that VLBW children attending daycare, in a private home or daycare center, are at higher risk for respiratory problems than VLBW children not attending daycare. We also investigated whether the effect of daycare is independent or synergistic with respiratory risk resulting from being VLBW, as indicated by having bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as a neonate. We conducted a prospective study of VLBW children followed from birth to age 2-3 (N = 715). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between daycare attendance and respiratory problems, adjusting for known neonatal risk factors for poor respiratory outcomes. Attending daycare in either a private home or in a daycare center was significantly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory infections than never attending. Attending a daycare center was also associated with higher risk for wheezy chest, cough without a cold, and respiratory medication use. While having BPD was associated with increased risk for respiratory problems, daycare attendance and BPD were not found to be synergistic risk factors for respiratory problems among VLBW children, but acted independently to increase risk. This implies that the increase in risk for respiratory problems associated with daycare attendance may be similar among VLBW children and those of normal birth weight.\n\n[The biomedical periodicals of Hungarian editions--historical overview].\n\nPubMed\n\nBerhidi, Anna; Geges, JÃ³zsef; Vasas, LÃ­via\n\n2006-03-12\n\nThe majority of Hungarian scientific results are published in international periodicals in foreign languages. Yet the publications in Hungarian scientific periodicals also should not be ignored. This study analyses biomedical periodicals of Hungarian edition from different points of view. Based on different databases a list of titles consisting of 119 items resulted, which contains both the core and the peripheral journals of the biomedical field. These periodicals were analysed empirically, one by one: checking out the titles. 13 of the titles are ceased, among the rest 106 Hungarian scientific journals 10 are published in English language. From the remaining majority of Hungarian language and publishing only a few show up in international databases. Although quarter of the Hungarian biomedical journals meet the requirements, which means they could be represented in international databases, these periodicals are not indexed. 42 biomedical periodicals are available online. Although quarter of these journals come with restricted access. 2/3 of the Hungarian biomedical journals have detailed instructions to authors. These instructions inform the publishing doctors and researchers of the requirements of a biomedical periodical. The increasing number of Hungarian biomedical journals published is welcome news. But it would be important for quality publications which are cited a lot to appear in the Hungarian journals. The more publications are cited, the more journals and authors gain in prestige on home and international level.\n\nM-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic reference values for three Hungarian dog breeds: Hungarian Vizsla, Mudi and Hungarian Greyhound.\n\nPubMed\n\nVÃ¶rÃ¶s, KÃ¡roly; Hetyey, Csaba; Reiczigel, Jeno; Czirok, GÃ¡bor Nagy\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to establish normal reference echocardiographic values for three Hungarian dog breeds, and to determine the potential dependence of intracardiac parameters on body weight, age and gender. M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed on 95 clinically healthy dogs including 45 Hungarian Vizslas, 28 Mudis and 22 Hungarian Greyhounds. Linear intracardiac measurements included interventricular septal thickness (IVS), left ventricular internal diameter (LVID), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) both in systole and diastole, as well as left atrial internal diameter (LAD), and aortic diameter (AOD) in early diastole. Fractional shortening (FS), end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes (EDV and ESV), as well as LAD:AOD ratio were calculated from the linear parameters. Mean, range and standard deviation of measurements were calculated for each breed. Body weight positively correlated in all three breeds with all left ventricular dimensions, such as IVS d , IVS s , LVID d , LVIDD s , LVPW d and LVPW s parameters. LA values showed positive correlations to body weight in all three breeds. AOD and LA demonstrated a positive correlation with body weight in Hungarian Vizslas and Mudis, whilst the LAD:AOD ratio was related to body weight only in Mudis. Gender did not correlate with any of the measured echocardiographic parameters in any breeds. In Mudis, a positive correlation was found between the LAD: AOD ratio and age, as well as between the LAD: AOD ratio and E point to septal separation (EPSS).\n\nDay care attendance and risk for respiratory morbidity among young very low birth weight children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHagen, Erika W.; Sadek-Badawi, Mona; Palta, Mari\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSummary Daycare attendance and very low birth weight (VLBW, â¤1500 grams) are associated with respiratory morbidity during childhood. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether daycare attendance is associated with even higher risk for respiratory problems among VLBW children.

Although the first maps included in a Hungarian textbook were probably made in 1751, the publication of atlases for schools is dated almost 50 years later, when professor ÃzsÃ¡iÃ¡s Budai created his \"New School Atlas for elementary pupils\" in 1800. This was followed by a long period of 90 years, when the school atlases were mostly translations and adaptations of foreign atlases, the majority of which were made in German-speaking countries. In those years, a school atlas made by a Hungarian astronomer, Antal VÃ¡llas, should be highlighted as a prominent independent piece of work. In 1890, a talented cartographer, ManÃ³ Kogutowicz founded the Hungarian Geographical Institute, which was the institution responsible for producing school atlases for the different types of schools in Hungary. The professional quality of the school atlases published by his institute was also recognized beyond the Hungarian borders by prizes won in international exhibitions. Kogutowicz laid the foundations of the current Hungarian school cartography: this statement is confirmed in the second part of this article, when three of his school atlases are presented in more detail to give examples of how the pupils were introduced to the basic cartographic and astronomic concepts as well as how different innovative solutions were used on the maps.\n\nDental needs of intellectualy disabled children attending six special educational facilities in Cape Town.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, T; Chetty, M; Kimmie-Dhansay, F; Fieggen, K; Stephen, L X G\n\n2016-05-25\n\nTo assess the dental needs of a group of children with intellectual disability (ID) attending six special educational facilities in Cape Town, South Africa.Â Methods. This was a cross-sectional study based on a convenience sampling method. One hundred and fifty-seven children with ID attending six special educational facilities in Cape Town were included in the survey. Five schools were exclusively funded by the State and one school received additional private financial support. The oral examinations complied with guidelines drafted by Special Olympics Special Smiles programme and the Centers for Disease Control, USA. The most common dental disorders requiring management were gingival disease (69%) and untreated dental caries (68%). Almost 50% of the children had missing teeth. Twenty-nine percent needed orthodontic correction of malocclusion and 7% had structural abnormalities of their teeth that required either aesthetic or functional intervention. Fillings were evident in only 8% of the children. Females required more dental treatment than males. The dental needs of children with ID increased with age. There were no significant differences in the dental needs of children attending State-funded schools and those attending the single school that received additional financial assistance. The frequency of unmet dental needs of children with ID attending special educational facilities in Cape Town was high and the dental care available to them was minimal. The study highlights the need for improved dental services to ensure that optimal oral health is accessible to children with ID attending special educational facilities in Cape Town.\n\nCross-cultural comparison of fertility specific quality of life in German, Hungarian and Jordanian couples attending a fertility center.\n\nPubMed\n\nSexty, RÃ©ka E; Hamadneh, Jehan; RÃ¶sner, Sabine; Strowitzki, Thomas; Ditzen, Beate; Toth, Bettina; Wischmann, Tewes\n\n2016-02-24\n\nOnly a few studies have reported cross-cultural comparisons regarding psychosocial consequences of infertility. Differences between societies with different cultural backgrounds were revealed and seemed to be based on the importance of pronatalism. Our aim was to measure cross-cultural differences in fertility specific quality of life of infertile couples in Germany, Hungary and Jordan who attend a fertility center in a cross-sectional study. A cross-sectional study was conducted in one fertility clinic in Germany, in five fertility clinics in Hungary and in one fertility clinic in Jordan. Overall 750 couples (252 couples in Jordan, 246 couples in Germany and 252 couples in Hungary) attending the first medical infertility consultation were asked to fill out our questionnaire set. Fertility specific quality of life (FertiQoL) and sociodemographic differences were measured between couples from three countries. Jordanian couples had the shortest relationship (5.8 Â± 4.3 yrs.), though they reported the longest duration of child wish (4.2 Â± 3.6 yrs.) and fertility treatments (3.0 Â± 3.3 yrs.). The proportion of high education was considerably higher in Jordanian women and men (60 % and 66 %, respectively) compared to the other two samples. First, marked cross-country differences were obtained on Emotional, Mind/Body and Relational subscales of the FertiQoL, indicating that Jordanian couples reported poorer fertility-related quality of life than Germans and Hungarians (p < 0.001). After controlling for the sociodemographic and medical variables, a significant difference only in the Emotional domain was observed (p < 0.001). The study revealed only a few cultural based differences in fertility specific quality of life between the couples of the three countries. Thus, infertility counselors should pay attention to psychosocial problems rooted in individual sociocultural aspects of the infertile couple regardless of cultural stereotypes.

The overwhelming majority of travel-related illnesses can be prevented with pre-travel medical consultations, but the syllabus and content of the consultation have to match the travel habits and culture of the given society. This publication explores the specificities and travel habits of Hungarian travellers. One hundred participants of a travel exhibition completed a survey about their international travel. As the survey was not representative, the data could only be processed through simple statistical methods. However, since the exhibition was presumably attended by those wishing to travel, the conclusions drawn from the results are worth publishing, since no similar survey in Hungary has been published before. Based on the suitable classification of age groups in travel medicine, 11% of the participants were adolescents / young adults (aged 15-24), 81% adults (25-59) and 8% elderly (60-74). Twenty-eight percent of the participants travel multiple times a year, 40% yearly and 32% of them less frequently; 16% of the adults, 8% of the adolescents and 4% of the elderly age group travel multiple times a year. The travel destinations of Hungarian travellers have remained practically unchanged since a study was conducted 13 years ago: the vast majority (95%) travelled within Europe, 2% to the United States, and 11% of them elsewhere. Since Hungarians do not travel to endemic areas, only 5% consulted their general practitioners (GPs) prior to travelling, and 29% did when they had to be vaccinated. Forty-two percent of those wishing to travel never consult their GPs, even though 29% of them are aware of some chronic illness. Instead, 51% gather their health information from the internet and only 6% from their doctors. By the contradiction between the poor health status of the majority of Hungarian travellers and the negligence of seeking pre-travel advice\n\nWho attends a Children's Hospital Emergency Department for dental reasons? A two-step cluster analysis approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarshman, Z; Broomhead, T; Rodd, H D; Jones, K; Burke, D; Baker, S R\n\n2016-09-28\n\nEmergency departments (EDs) have been identified as key providers of dental care although few studies have examined patterns of attendance or clusters of characteristics. The aim was to identify the reasons for visits to an ED, whether these remained stable over time, and characterize clusters of patients by socio-demographic and attendance variables. Pseudonymized data were obtained for children who attended the ED in 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2012-2013. Presenting complaint was categorized as attending for dental or nondental reasons. Other variables analysed included patient (age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation) and attendance characteristics (distance travelled, season, nature of complaint, time elapsed since onset of symptoms, day of week and hours of attendance), together with treatment outcome (advice, antibiotics and referral). To assess trends over time, analyses were conducted on patient, attendance and treatment outcome variables. To examine whether patients could be characterized by socio-demographic and attendance variables, a two-step cluster analysis was undertaken on 2003-2004 data set and validated on 2004-2005 and 2012-2013 data sets. In 2003-2004, 550 children attended the ED for dental reasons rising to 687 in 2012-2013. The most important predictors of dental attendance were as follows: nature of complaint, ethnicity, time elapsed, sex and deprivation of the area in which children lived. The analysis showed two clusters: cluster 1 was comprised of children who attended the ED for dental injury, were of White ethnicity and attended within 24 h of onset of symptoms. Children in this cluster were likely to be from the least or less deprived areas (compared to Cluster 2) and were more likely to be males. Cluster 2 comprised of children attending the ED for caries, oral mucosal lesions or other complaints, were likely to be of other (non-White) ethnicities and were likely to attend more than 24 h after symptoms began. Children in this cluster were\n\n[VALIDATION OF THE HUNGARIAN UNIFIED DYSKINESIA RATING SCALE].\n\nPubMed\n\nHorvÃ¡th, Krisztina; Aschermann, Zsuzsanna; Ãcs, PÃ©ter; BosnyÃ¡k, Edit; Deli, Gabriella; PÃ¡l, Endre; KÃ©smÃ¡rki, Ildiko; Horvath, RÃ©ka; Takacs, Katalin; BalÃ¡zs, Eva; Komoly, SÃ¡muel; Bokor, Magdolna; RigÃ³, Eszter; Lajtos, JÃºlia; TakÃ¡ts, AnnamÃ¡ria; TÃ³th, AdriÃ¡n; KlivÃ©nyi, PÃ©ter; DibÃ³, GyÃ¶rgy; Vecsei, LÃ¡szlÃ³; Hidasi, Eszter; Nagy, Ferenc; Herceg, MihÃ¡ly; Imre, Piroska; KovÃ¡cs, Norbert\n\n2015-05-30\n\nThe Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) was published in 2008. It was designed to be simultaneous valid, reliable and sensitive to therapeutic changes. The Movement Disorder Society organizing team developed guidelines for the development of official non-English translations consisting of four steps: translation/back-translation, cognitive pretesting, large field testing, and clinimetric analysis. The aim of this paper was to introduce the new UDysRS and its validation process into Hungarian. After the translation of UDysRS into Hungarian and back-translated into English, it was reviewed by the UDysRS translation administration team. Subsequent cognitive pretesting was conducted with ten patients. For the large field testing phase, the Hungarian official working draft version of UDysRS was tested with 256 patients with Parkinson's disease having dyskinesia. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) determined whether the factor structure for the valid Spanish UDysRS could be confirmed in data collected using the Hungarian Official Draft Version. To become an official translation, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) had to be â¥ 0.90 compared to the Spanish-language version. For the Hungarian UDysRS the CFI was 0.98. The overall factor structure of the Hungarian version was consistent with that of the Spanish version based on the high CFIs for the UDysRS in the CFA; therefore, this version was designated as the Official Hungarian Version Of The UDysRS.\n\nTesting Central and Inner Asian admixture among contemporary Hungarians.\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ­rÃ³, AndrÃ¡s; FehÃ©r, Tibor; BÃ¡rÃ¡ny, GusztÃ¡v; Pamjav, Horolma\n\n2015-03-01\n\nHistorically, the Carpathian Basin was the final destination for many nomadic peoples who migrated westward from Inner and Central Asia towards Europe. Proto-Hungarians (Steppe Magyars) were among those who came from the East, the Eurasian Steppe in the early middle ages. In order to detect the paternal genetic contribution from nomadic Steppe tribes, we tested 966 samples from Central Asian (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan), Inner Asian (Mongolians and Buryats in Mongolia) and Hungarian-speaking European (Hungarian, Sekler and Csango) populations. We constructed median-joining networks of certain haplogroups in Hungarian-speaking European, and Altaic-speaking Central and Inner Asian populations. We estimated that the possible paternal genetic contribution from the above described populations among contemporary Hungarian speaking populations ranged between 5% and 7.4%. It is lowest among Hungarians from Hungary (5.1%), while higher among Hungarian-speaking groups in Romania, notably Sekler (7.4%) and Csango (6.3%). However, these results represent only an upper limit. Actual Central/Inner Asian admixture might be somewhat lower as some of the related lineages may have come from a common third source. The main haplogroups responsible for the Central/Inner Asian admixture among Hungarians are J2*-M172 (xM47, M67, M12), J2-L24, R1a-Z93; Q-M242 and E-M78. Earlier studies showed very limited Uralic genetic influence among Hungarians, and based on the present study, Altaic/Turkic genetic contribution is also not significant, although significantly higher than the Uralic one. The conclusion of this study is that present-day Hungarian speakers are genetically very similar to neighbouring populations, isolated Hungarian speaking groups having relatively higher presence of Central and Inner Asian genetic elements. At the same time, the reliable historical and genetic conclusions require an extension of the study to a significantly larger database with deep haplogroup resolution\n\nOtitis Media and the Social Behavior of Day-Care-Attending Children.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVernon-Feagans, Lynne; And Others\n\n1996-01-01\n\nExamined the relationship between early otitis media in children attending day care and children's subsequent behavior in the day care classroom when they were well.

Children, aged between 5-16 years, presenting with an injury related to sport, were studied over a period of three months. 1858 children attended the A&E department during the three month period. 238 (12.8%) were classified as sports injuries. Boys (71%) were injured more frequently than girls (29%). Injury rates in boys peaked at 14 years whereas in girls a peak occurred earlier at 12 years. Football was the most common sport implicated in injuries (39%). Rollerblading (14%), Rugby (8%), Basketball (7%) and Physical Education at school (7%) were the next most frequently involved sports. Soft tissue injuries dominated (61%). The upper limb was the most common anatomical area injured (46%). Other injuries involved the lower limb (36%), head and neck (15%) and the trunk (3%). Injuries to the wrist were the most frequent presentation accounting for 30 fractures and 30 soft tissue injuries (25%). The majority of children were discharged from the A&E department after treatment (71%). 26% were reviewed at out-patient clinics and 3% required hospital admission. No children were referred for physiotherapy. Children participate in sport and can be injured. The majority of sports injuries presenting to an A&E department appear to be of a minor nature and could be managed with simple first aid techniques by parents, teachers and coaches at the scene or by attending primary care in the first instance. Supervision of children, participation in organised sport and the use of protection devices may help to prevent serious injury.\n\nOverview of the Hungarian National Youth Fitness Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCsÃ¡nyi, TamÃ¡s; Finn, Kevin J.; Welk, Gregory J.; Zhu, Weimo; Karsai, IstvÃ¡n; IhÃ¡sz, Ferenc; Vass, ZoltÃ¡n; MolnÃ¡r, LÃ¡szlÃ³\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe 2012 Public Act on Education in Hungary made daily physical education (PE) a mandatory part of the school day starting in the 2012â2013 school year. This directive was linked to a significant reorganization of the Hungarian education system including a new National Core Curriculum that regulates the objectives and contents of PE. The Hungarian School Sport Federation (HSSF) recognized the opportunity and created the Strategic Actions for Health-Enhancing Physical Education or TestnevelÃ©s az EgÃ©szsÃ©gfejlesztÃ©sben StratÃ©giai IntÃ©zkedÃ©sek (TESI) project. Physical fitness assessments have been a traditional part of the Hungarian PE program; however, the TESI plan called for the use of a new health-related battery and assessment system to usher in a new era of fitness education in the country. The HSSF enlisted the Cooper Institute to assist in building an infrastructure for full deployment of a national student fitness assessment program based on the FITNESSGRAMÂ® in Hungarian schools. The result is a new software-supported test battery, namely the Hungarian National Student Fitness Test (NETFIT), which uses health-related, criterion-referenced youth fitness standards. The NETFIT system now serves as a compulsory fitness assessment for all Hungarian schools. This article details the development process for the test battery and summarizes the aims and methods of the Hungarian National Youth Fitness Study.

Data for the study were taken from the second French cross-sectional dietary survey (INCA2-2006-07). In total, 1413 school children aged 3-17 years old were classified according to their school type and their usual school lunch attendance. Eating habits included meal regularity, dietary diversity, purchase in vending machine, snacking habits and frequency of eating in fast-foods. Two composite indices of eating habits were derived from multiple correspondence analyses. Sedentary behaviour was assessed by the average daily screen times for TV and computer. The association between school lunch attendance and each variable was tested. Multivariate association between school lunch attendance and the composite indices of eating habits and sedentary behaviours was studied. In all, 69.0% (CI(95%): 64.2-73.9) of secondary school children and 63.0% (CI(95%): 58.5-67.5) of pre- and elementary school children usually attended school lunch at least once a week. Pre- and elementary school children attending school lunches showed a higher dietary diversity score (P=0.02) and ate morning snacks more frequently (P=0.02). In secondary school children, attending school canteen was related to a lower rate of skipping breakfast (P=0.04) and main meals (P=0.01). In all school children, school lunch attendance was simultaneously associated with healthier overall eating habits and less sedentary behaviour. In France, children attending school canteens seem to have healthier eating habits and display less sedentary behaviour, independently of their socio-economic and demographic background.\n\nHungarian Folk Arts and Crafts.

The present study was performed to provide valid, up-to-date data on energy and nutrient intakes and dietary habits of the Hungarian adult population. The energy and nutrient intakes were calculated on validated three-day dietary records of a representative sample by age and gender of the Hungarian population aged â¥ 18 ys. The energy percentage of fat was too high (39 E% for men and 36 E% for women), that of carbohydrate was too low (45 E% for men and 48 E% for women), whereas that of protein met the recommendation (15 E% for men and 15 E% for women). Reduction of the nutritional risk factors would greatly reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of nutrition-related diseases.\n\nThe impact of daycare attendance on outdoor free play in young children.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarsley, S; Liang, L Y; Chen, Y; Parkin, P; Maguire, J; Birken, C S\n\n2017-03-01\n\nOutdoor free play is important for healthy growth and development in early childhood. Recent studies suggest that the majority of time spent in daycare is sedentary. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an association between daycare attendance and parent-reported outdoor free play. Healthy children aged 1-5 years recruited to The Applied Research Group for Kids! (TARGet Kids!), a primary care research network, were included. Parents reported daycare use, outdoor free play and potential confounding variables. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the association between daycare attendance and outdoor free play, adjusted for age, sex, maternal ethnicity, maternal education, neighborhood income and season. There were 2810 children included in this study. Children aged 1 to <3 years (n = 1388) and â¥3 to 5 years (n = 1284) who attended daycare had 14.70 min less (95% CI -20.52, -8.87; P < 0.01) and 9.44 min less (95% CI -13.67, -5.20; P < 0.01) per day of outdoor free play compared with children who did not attend daycare, respectively. Children who spend more time in daycare have less parent-reported outdoor free play. Parents may be relying on daycare to provide opportunity for outdoor free play and interventions to promote increased active play opportunities outside of daycare are needed. Â© The Author 2016.

Because of their impoverished health care system, unregulated heavily industrialized society, and unhealthful life-styles Hungarians were hypothesized to have poorer health status than Americans, even after taking into account demographic mediating factors. The study provides a health status baseline for elderly Hungarians shortly after communism's fall in 1989-1990 and shows how great a gap exists between Hungarian health status and that in the West. Hungarians were in much poorer health as measured by functional status, symptomatology, medical condition, depression, and subjective health status. Distinctions persisted when controlling for gender, age, and education. Poverty-level (and income) did not explain health status differences. The paper concludes that Hungary should pay more attention to health promotion, prevention, and primary care, as well as to reforming patient management in hospitals, nursing homes, and home care programs.\n\nMore than Just a Meal: Breakfast Club Attendance and Children's Social Relationships.\n\nPubMed\n\nDefeyter, Margaret Anne; Graham, Pamela Louise; Russo, Riccardo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe health benefits of school food have been widely promoted in recent years while the social opportunities that surround eating occasions at school have received little attention. Breakfast clubs (BCs), which take place at the start of the school day, offer a unique opportunity for children to consume a breakfast meal on their school premises in the company of their peers. Alternatively, after-school clubs (ASCs), which take place on school premises at the end of the school day, whilst also providing children with social opportunities tend to focus on sports engagement and skill development. The aim of the current paper is to investigate whether attendance at BCs and ASCs has an impact on children's friendship quality and experiences of peer victimization. BC attendees, ASC attendees, and non-attendees completed the Friendship Qualities Scale and the Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale (MPVS) at two time points. Time-1 data were collected 2âmonths after the introduction of school clubs. Time-2 data were then collected on the same measures again 6âmonths later. Results of the analyses of Time-1 data showed no significant differences between groups on any of the measures at Time-1. However, at Time-2, BC attendees showed improved levels of friendship quality compared to the other two groups. Moreover, analysis of the MPVS data at Time-2 showed that children who attended BC or ASC experienced a decline in victimization across time. The current findings suggest that BC attendance facilitates the quality of children's relationships with their best friend over time. Additionally, attendance at a breakfast or ASC was associated with a reduction in victimization over time. The results have implications for utilization of breakfast and ASCs to aid children's social relationships in school over time.\n\nThe mental health of children of migrant workers in Beijing: the protective role of public school attendance.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Qin; Li, Hong; Zou, Hong; Cross, Wendi; Bian, Ran; Liu, Yan\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe present study aims to understand the mental health status of an understudied group of migrant children - children of migrant workers in China. A total of 1,466 children from Beijing participated in the study that compared migrant children (nÂ =Â 1,019) to their local peers (nÂ =Â 447) in public and private school settings. Results showed that overall, migrant children reported more internalizing and externalizing mental health problems and lower life satisfaction than local peers. However, public school attendance served as a protective factor for migrant children's mental health. The mental health status of migrant children attending public schools, including externalizing problems as well as friend and school satisfaction, was not different from local children. In addition, our data indicates that the protective effect of public school attendance for migrant children may be even more salient among girls than boys, and for younger children than older children.

Indigenous communities in South Australia's mid-north region have identified dental health as one of their top health priorities. In response to this, an oral health program based at the Pika Wiya Health Service in Port Augusta was established, with a dentist providing care for adults, and a dental therapist providing care for children, 2 days per week each. The purpose of this article is to compare the socio-demographic and oral health characteristics of children attending for care at the Pika Wiya Health Service Dental Clinic with those of their counterparts attending the general Port Augusta School Dental Service (SDS). Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children were included. Data were obtained from the South Australian Dental Service (SADS), which routinely collects socio-demographic and dental information from patients seen through their system. Examinations were conducted by SADS-employed dental professionals. A full enumeration of children attending for care at Pika Wiya and the Port Augusta SDS from March 2001 to March 2006 was included. Surface level tooth data was captured using the EXACT treatment charting and management information system. The Socio-Economic Indices For Areas (SEIFA) were used to determine socio-economic status, and the dmft (sum of decayed, missing and filled teeth in the deciduous dentition) and DMFT (sum of decayed, missing and filled teeth in the permanent dentition) indices were used to assess oral health outcomes. Both measures were used for children aged 6-10 years because in such age groups children have a mixed dentition (both primary and permanent teeth are present). Caries prevalence (dmft/DMFT>0) and severity (mean dmft/DMFT) were calculated, as well as the Significant Caries Index (SiC) and Significant Caries Index 10 (SiC 10). The SiC is the mean dmft/DMFT of the one-third of the sample with the highest caries score\n\nMigration, Remittances, and Children's High School Attendance: The Case of Rural China\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHu, Feng\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper uses a large nationally representative survey data to examine the impact of China's rural-urban migration on high school attendance of left-behind children by disentangling the effect of remittances from that of migration.

Lack of public services to older people reduces attendance at work among their children.\n\nPubMed\n\nGautun, Heidi; Bratt, Christopher\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe need to provide care for older people can put a strain on their adult children, potentially interfering with their work attendance. We tested the hypothesis that public care for older people (nursing homes or home care services) would moderate the association between having an older parent in need of care and reduced work attendance among the adult children. The analysis used data from a survey of Norwegian employees aged 45-65 ( N Â =Â 529). Institutional care for older people in need of care (i.e. nursing homes) was associated with improved work attendance among their children-their daughters in particular. Data also indicated a moderating effect: the link between the parents' reduced health and reduced work attendance among the children was weaker if the parent lived in a nursing home. However, the results were very different for home-based care: data indicated no positive effects on adult children's work attendance when parents received non-institutionalised care of this kind. Overall, the results suggest that extending public care service to older people can improve their children's ability to combine work with care for parents. However, this effect seems to require the high level of care commonly provided by nursing homes. Thus, the current trend towards de-institutionalising care in Europe (and Norway in particular) might hamper work attendance among care-giving adult children, women in particular. Home care services to older people probably need to be extended if they are intended as a real alternative to institutional care.\n\nHungarian space research 1981-1985: Lectures and review articles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBenko, G.

This study determined the prevalence and species type of helminth infestation and associated factors among children attending Princess Marie Louise Children's Hospital in Accra, Ghana. Children (225) below the age of 10 who have not taken antihelminthic drugs prior to the study period were recruited between May and June 2015. Children or guardians were interviewed using structured questionnaires and fresh stools were collected and processed for helminths species identification using microscopy. Data were analyzed using Stata version 12. Overall helminths infestation prevalence was 17.33% (39/225). The identified species were hookworm (10.22% (23/225)) and Ascaris lumbricoides (7.11% (16/225)). No double infestation was observed. Significant associations were observed between infestation and age group beyond 4 years (48 months) (aOR = 16.72, 95% CI 1.00â279.72), place of residence (aOR = 7.35, 95% CI 1.68â32.11), washing hands after using toilet (0.04, 95% CI 0.01â0.20), and dirt on fingernails of children (7.96, 95% CI 1.73â36.65). This study demonstrates high prevalence of helminths parasites, hookworm, and Ascaris lumbricoides in children attending PMLCH.

To investigate what proportion of 3- and 5-year-olds living in Flanders (Belgium) have already visited the dentist, to describe parents' experience about their child's dental visit, and to explore factors that may have an impact on children's early dental visit. Data were collected from 1057 children; validated questionnaires were completed, and children were examined by trained dentist at ages 3 and 5. Logistic regression analyses were performed to explain dental attendance. At the age of 3, 62% and by 5âyears, 21% had never visited the dentist. The first dental visit was considered a pleasant experience for the majority of children. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that children who were not first born, whose mothers had a higher educational level and whose parents had recently visited the dentist, had significantly higher odds for having visited the dentist at young age. Parents of young children need to be informed about and motivated for an early dental visit. Promotion campaigns should focus on firstborn children, children from less educated parents, and parents who do not regularly see a dentist. Â© 2012 The Authors.

The film documents the historical moment when the Hungarian workshop participants encounter the drag king as a lesbian tool for parodying and repoliticizing mainstream masculinity. I examine the ways in which the participants interpret their performances of masculinity and the film negotiates heteronormativity. I argue that the political merits of the film can be spelled out by reading the participants' (trans)gender politics from the perspective of the cultural specificities of post-socialist Hungary.\n\nCross-Validation of FITNESSGRAMÂ® Health-Related Fitness Standards in Hungarian Youth\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLaurson, Kelly R.; Saint-Maurice, Pedro F.; Karsai, IstvÃ¡n; CsÃ¡nyi, TamÃ¡s\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to cross-validate FITNESSGRAMÂ® aerobic and body composition standards in a representative sample of Hungarian youth.

Data source: A literature search was carried out in the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases of studies published from 1990 to 2013 in Portuguese and English languages. The following search strategy was used: (nutritional status OR anthropometrics OR malnutrition OR overweight) AND daycare centers, as well as the equivalent terms in Portuguese. In the case of MEDLINE search, the descriptor Brazil was also used. Data synthesis: It was verified that the 33 studies included in the review were comparable from a methodological point of view. The studies, in general, were characterized by their restrictive nature, geographical concentration and dispersion of results in relation to time. Considering the studies published from 2010 onwards, low prevalence of acute malnutrition and significant rates of stunting and overweight were observed. Conclusions: Despite the limitations, considering the most recent studies that used the WHO growth curves (2006), it is suggested that the anthropometric profile of Brazilian children attending daycare centers is characterized by a nutritional transition process, with significant prevalence of overweight and short stature. We emphasize the need to develop a multicenter survey that will more accurately define the current anthropometric nutritional status of Brazilian children attending daycare centers.

IPD episodes involved occult bacteremia (n = 48), pneumonia (n = 10), meningitis (n = 10), periorbital cellulitis (n = 3), and mastoiditis (n = 1), including 3 cases of two IPD recurrences. We analyzed 5 IPD-associated factors previously documented in Europe and North Amrica with inconsistent results--1) age at onset, 2) sibling number, 3) preschool sibling number, 4) subjects' day care attendance, and 5) siblings' day care attendance. We collected information on these factors by reviewing medical charts or contacting subjects' parents or guardians by telephone. IPD peaked bimodally in April and May (n = 21) and in November and December (n = 20), decreasing prominently between July and September (n = 8). Subjects with IPD attending day care formed a significantly higher propotion during April and May than did those developing IPD during other months: 12/21 [57.1%] vs. 12/51 [23.5%], odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-12.8; p = 0.006. Combined day care attendance among subjects with IPD and/or their siblings also differed significantly between these two groups: 17/21 [80.9%] vs. 27/51 [52.9%], odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.8; p = 0.027. Not significant differences were seen in age at onset, sibling number, or preschool sibling number. In contrast, however children with IPD onset during November and December showed no significant difference in association with any of the 5 factors, compared to children with IPD onset in other months. Our findings showed a bimodal peak in IPD in children, the first and highest of which occurred in April and May and was significantly associated with day care attendance by those with IPD and/or their siblings. This first peak may, however, be related to circumstances in\n\n[A peculiar man - about Hans Selye, as reflected in his Hungarian connections].\n\nPubMed\n\nSzabÃ³, Katalin\n\n2015-08-30\n\nHans Selye made a great impact on the Hungarian medical, scientific and public life.

His Hungarian relationship was quite extensive after the war as he published, gave lectures, and accepted Hungarian students for specialized training in his Canadian institute saw. The rich documents in archives about Selye are currently being processed and those will surely shed light on Selye's life in further details.\n\n[Sport habits and sedentary lifestyle among elementary school children in Obuda, Hungary].\n\nPubMed\n\nKovÃ¡cs, ViktÃ³ria Anna; GÃ¡bor, Anita; FajcsÃ¡k, Zsuzsanna; Martos, Eva\n\n2010-04-18\n\nChildhood obesity has become a worldwide epidemic. Declining physical activity is one of the major contributors. To obtain data on Hungarian primary school students' weight status, sport club participation and sedentary behaviors. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to all primary schools (n=18) in Obuda, Budapest. Children (1648 boys, 1654 girls; 11.3+/-2.3 years) completed questionnaires about sedentary behaviors and sport participation. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured. According to the IOTF criteria, 14.5% of the children were overweight and 4.6% were obese. The rate of those children who did not attend any extracurricular sport increased parallel with age in both gender. At the lower end of the range, 15.3% of the 9-year-old boys and 21% of the 10-year old girls did not sport. These numbers increased up to 31.0% in boys and 53.8% in girls by the age of 15 years. Screening time on weekdays and on weekends was 2.2+/-1.9 and 3.6+/-2.6 hours/day, respectively. One third of participants (32.2%) spent >2 h/day in front of a screen on weekdays, whereas 61.8% did on weekends. The frequency of sedentary behaviors was high among urban Hungarian school children. Health promotion strategies should start in early ages.\n\nHungarian University Students' Misunderstandings in Thermodynamics and Chemical Kinetics\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTuranyi, Tamas; Toth, Zoltan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe misunderstandings related to thermodynamics (including chemical equilibrium) and chemical kinetics of first and second year Hungarian students of chemistry, environmental science, biology and pharmacy were investigated.

To describe the patterns of refractive errors among children attending the outpatient clinic at the Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Lumbini Eye Institute, Bhairahawa, Nepal. Records of 133 children with refractive errors aged 5 - 15 years from both the urban and rural areas of Nepal and the adjacent territory of India attending the hospital between September and November 2010 were examined for patterns of refractive errors. The SPSS statistical software was used to perform data analysis. The commonest type of refractive error among the children was astigmatism (47 %) followed by myopia (34 %) and hyperopia (15 %). The refractive error was more prevalent among children of both the genders of age group 11-15 years as compared to their younger counterparts (RR = 1.22, 95 % CI = 0.66 - 2.25). The refractive error was more common (70 %) in the rural than the urban children (26 %). The rural females had a higher (38 %) prevalence of myopia than urban females (18 %). Among the children with refractive errors, only 57 % were using spectacles at the initial presentation. Astigmatism is the commonest type of refractive error among the children of age 5 - 15 years followed by hypermetropia and myopia. Refractive error remains uncorrected in a significant number of children.

In the last eight years a high prevalence of toxocariasis (32.2-56.0%) has been reported in children attending public health units from municipalities in the state of ParanÃ¡, Brazil. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the frequency found among the general child population with that of children attending a public pneumology service in MaringÃ¡, ParanÃ¡, Brazil and describe the laboratorial, clinical and epidemiological findings. The research was conducted at the ConsÃ³rcio PÃºblico Intermunicipal de SaÃºde do SetentriÃ£o Paranaense (CISAMUSEP) from July 2009 to July 2010 among children aged between one and 15 years. From a total of 167 children studied, only 4.2% (7/167) tested positive for anti-Toxocara spp. IgG antibodies and presented mild eosinophilia (2/7), increased serum IgE levels (6/7) and a positive allergy test for mites (5/7). The presence of pets (dogs or cats) at home did not correlate with the seroprevalence. In conclusion, cases of toxocariasis involving the respiratory tract are rare in children attending a public health pneumology unit in the northwestern region of ParanÃ¡ State, despite the high prevalence of this type of toxocariasis among the infantile population attending Basic Health Units in the same geographical area.\n\nAttending to Relations: Proportional Reasoning in 3- to 6-Year-Old Children\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHurst, Michelle A.; Cordes, Sara\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWhen proportional information is pit against whole number numerical information, children often attend to the whole number information at the expense of proportional information (e.g., indicating 4/9 is greater than 3/5 because 4 > 3).

In outpatient children with a chronic disease attending special schools, this association has never been studied. The aim of this study was to assess the association between nutritional status and subjective health status in chronically ill children attending special schools. Overall, 642 children, median age 9.8 years (IQR 7.7-11.5), 60 % male, 72 % Caucasian, were included in this prospective study in nine special schools for chronically ill children in the Netherlands. Overall malnutrition was assessed as: acute malnutrition (<-2 SDS for weight for height (WFH)) and chronic malnutrition (<-2 SDS for height for age). The malnutrition risk was assessed with the nutritional risk-screening tool STRONGkids. Subjective health status was assessed with EQ-5D. Overall, 16 % of the children had overall malnutrition: 3 % acute and 13 % chronic malnutrition. Nurses reported 'some/severe problems' on the health status dimensions mobility (15 %), self-care (17 %), usual activities (19 %), pain/discomfort (22 %), and anxiety/depression (22 %) in chronically ill children. Their mean visual analogue scale score (VAS) was 73.0 (SD 11.1). Malnutrition, medication usage, and younger age explained 38 % of the variance of the VAS score. The presence of overall malnutrition in chronically ill children attending special schools was associated with lower subjective health status, especially in younger children and in those with chronic medication usage. Therefore, it is important to develop and use profile-screening tools to identify these children.\n\nMaternal Genetic Ancestry and Legacy of 10(th) Century AD Hungarians.\n\nPubMed\n\nCsÅsz, Aranka; SzÃ©csÃ©nyi-Nagy, Anna; CsÃ¡kyovÃ¡, Veronika; LangÃ³, PÃ©ter; BÃ³dis, ViktÃ³ria; KÃ¶hler, Kitti; TÃ¶mÃ¶ry, GyÃ¶ngyvÃ©r; Nagy, Melinda; Mende, BalÃ¡zs GusztÃ¡v\n\n2016-09-16\n\nThe ancient Hungarians originated from the Ural region in today's central Russia and migrated across the Eastern European steppe, according to historical sources.

There are discrepancies in the literature on this subject. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of attending kindergartens on the risk of acute infections and the use of health care resources in children less than 24 months. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on two cohorts of children 0-24 months (born between 1 January and 30 September 2010), who were grouped according to whether they attended kindergarten or not, and were usually seen in 33 pediatric clinics of the Principality of Asturias Public Health Service. A total of 975 children were studied, of whom 43.7% attended a kindergarten at 24 months. Attending kindergarten increases the risk of pneumonia by 131%, recurrent wheezing by 69%, bronchitis by 57%, and otitis media by 64%. Early exposure to kindergarten increases the risk of pneumonia from 2.31 to 2.81, and the mean emergency room visits from 1 to 2.3. The mean antibiotic cycle is 1.7 in children who do not go to kindergarten, 3.4 if started within the first 6 months, and 2 if they start at 18 months. Day-care attendance is a risk factor of infectious diseases that increases if attending kindergartens from an early age. Copyright Â© 2014 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a.

Semi-structured interviews with 21 nurses caring for technology-dependent children were conducted and analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach. Nurses developed roles centered on maintaining technology-dependent children's physical health to support children's learning with each other, through building relationships, learning how to interact with children, understanding the children and the school community, and realizing the meaning of supporting technology-dependent children. These findings support nurses to build relationships of mutual trust with teachers and children, and learn on the job in mainstream schools.

Parental provision of sex-typed and neutral toys and approval of cross-sex role behaviour was also assessed. On both measures, the two groups of children showed culturally typical patterns of gender-role behaviour. The parents of the two groups of children were generally similar in terms of the kinds of toys they provided and in their attitudes toward the expression of cross-sex role behaviour. Potential explanations for the inability to demonstrate effects of the \"non-sexist\" child-rearing philosophy were discussed.\n\nHungarian topics in Zach's German journals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatkÃ³s, LÃ¡szlÃ³\n\nTwo hundred years ago geography and astronomy were very close branches of science. The great task of the era was the determination of exact geographical positions, and astronomical methods were widely used for it. In the volumes of Allgemeine Geographische Ephemeriden (AGE) and in the Monatliche Correspondenz (MC) a large proportion of the Hungarian topics also deal with the geography of Hungary. One can read news from Hungary in letters written mainly by Schedius and (after 1802) by Lipszky. The most important Hungarian scientific enterprise of the era was the geographical mapping of the country. As part of this work the young astronomer Bogdanich determined many astronomical positions, and he also made various different other astronomical observations too. One of the most spectacular astronomical events of the era was the transit of Mercury in front of the sun on May 7, 1799. The four contacts were determined at many observatories all over Europe, among them at Ofen (Buda), Dubitza and Carlsburg (GyulafÃ©hervÃ¡r) in Hungary. The observed second and third contacts were used by Wurm to compute the geographical longitudes of these places (AGE 4 (1799) 218 and MC 8 (1803) 115). Three solar eclipses observed at the beginning of the XIXth century were also used for longitude determinations. In Hungary the eclipses of Aug 27, 1802, and of Aug 17, 1803, were observed at Ofen, and that of Feb 11, 1804, at Carlsburg observatory (Wurm: MC 7 (1805) 351). Another solar eclipse (the one on Jun 16, 1806) was used by the same author to determine the longitudes of Ofen and Erlau (Eger), together with a further 38 other European observatories. (MC 27 (1813) 401). The most common astrometric method for longitude determinations at that time was the observation of occultations. In a table published by Triesnecker (AGE 1 (1798) 284) the geographical position of Buda observatory (Ofen) was based on two solar eclipses and twelve stellar occultations.

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the information on Hungarian Internet sites on ECT and ECV with respect to their depiction and acceptance by the public. An Internet search was undertaken with the Google search engine using the terms \"ECT\", \"electroconvulsive therapy\", \"electroshock\", \"defibrillator\" and \"electric cardioversion\". The search was restricted to information published in the Hungarian language from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010. All communications were classified into negative, neutral and positive groups depending on their attitude towards the aforementioned treatment methods. Professional or non-professional categories were also distinguished. The total number of communications, which appeared between 2000 and 2010 and contained one of the search words for ECT was 66. The majority of them portrayed ECT in a negative (24; 36.4%) or neutral (25; 37.9%) fashion. Most of the websites (139; 95.2%) related to ECV were reflected positive (120; 82.2%) and neutral opinions (19; 13.0%). Hungarian-language Internet sites mainly view ECT as negative or neutral in contrast to ECV cardioversion, which has almost entirely a positive reputation. Although the effectiveness of both therapies is equally well established, their public image as manifested on the Internet differs significantly. This may have a major impact on the frequency of their use.\n\nSchool attendance and daily respiratory symptoms in children: influence of moisture damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nCasas, L; Espinosa, A; Pekkanen, J; Asikainen, A; BorrÃ s-Santos, A; Jacobs, J; Krop, E J M; TÃ¤ubel, M; HyvÃ¤rinen, A; Heederik, D; Zock, J-P\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe investigated the effect of weekends and school holidays on the daily frequency and severity of respiratory and other symptoms among children attending schools with (index) or without (reference) moisture damage in Spain, the Netherlands, and Finland. Throughout 1Â year, parents of 419 children with a respiratory condition attending index (n=15) or reference (n=10) primary schools completed three symptom diaries. We assessed associations between lower respiratory tract, upper respiratory tract or allergy, and other symptom scores and school day, weekend, or summer holiday using mixed regression models stratified by country and moisture damage. We evaluated interactions between moisture damage and type of day. We combined country-specific estimates (incidence rate ratios [IRRs] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) in meta-analyses. Symptom scores were lower during weekends and holiday. Lower respiratory tract symptoms were statistically significantly less common during holiday with strongest effect in index schools (IRR=0.7; CI=0.6-0.8). Reporting of other symptoms was more reduced during holiday in index (IRR=0.6; CI=0.4-0.9) than in reference (IRR=0.95; CI=0.8-1.2) schools (interaction P<.01). In conclusion, symptoms were less frequent and/or severe during summer holiday and weekends.
