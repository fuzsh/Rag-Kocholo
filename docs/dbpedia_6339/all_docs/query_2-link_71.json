A francia csatahajók, cirkálók és rombolók harapófogóba zárták a ZENTÁ-t mely a part közelében maradt az ellenség tüzérségi bemérésének megnehezítése érdekében. Her escort destroyer, SMS ULAN got an order to break through with her greater speed to Cattaro, while Pachner sent a report by radio, that 17 big warship are pursuing them.a kísérőromboló, az ULAN parancsot kapott, hogy a nagyobb sebességével törjön át Cattaro felé, míg Pachner rádión jelentette, hogy 17 nagy hajó üldözi. The enemy fired two dummy ammunitions on her fromaz ellenség méterrőletres, so called upon the small cruiser to surrenderleadott két lövést vaklőszerrel, ezzel szólítva fel a kis cirkálót megállásra és megadásra. As a response Pachner made hoisted the small dressing of flags and the ship s silk Flag of Honour.Válaszképpen Pachner felvonatta a kis lobogódíszt és a hajó selyem díszlobogóját. The pursuers opened fire at kor az üldözők tüzet nyitottak rá, but the 12 cm guns of SMSde a ZENTA could not fire to such a great range, and she could only fire on the French and British ships when the distance reduced less than 10,000 metres12 cm-es lövegei nem érhették el a francia és angol hajókat, és csak akkor viszonozta a tüzet, amikor a lőtávolság méter alá csökkent. The whole enemy fleet shelled the old cruiser and very soon a 30.5 cm shell hit her engine room and destroyed the main steam pipeline.a teljes flotta az öreg cirkálót lőtte és hamarosan egy 30,5 cm-es lövedék eltalálta a gépházát, és szétrombolta a fő gőzvezetékét. The cruiser therefore stopped at hours.a cirkáló így 9 órakor mozdulatlanná vált. TheAz SMS ULAN due to her speed of 28 knots broke through to Cattaroa 28 csomó sebességének köszönhetően áttört Cattaro felé. After more hits fires broke out on board of SMS ZENTA; the hospital room and the first aid station were destroyed, but she fired on with her few undamaged gunsaz újabb találatok következtében a ZENTA kigyulladt, tönkrement a kórházterem, és az elsősegélyhely, de még tovább tüzelt a néhány épségben maradt lövegével. The cruiser begun sink because of the hits got under the water line, so Commander Pachner gave order to abandon ship.a vízvonalat ért találatok következtében a cirkáló süllyedni kezdett, és ekkor Pachner fregattkapitány parancsot adott a hajó elhagyására. The crew jumped into the sea, because all the boats were destroyed. A legénység a vízbe vetette magát, mivel az összes csónak tönkrementwhen the swimmer went away from the flaming ship, Pachner seen there are several men on the quarterdeck, who had not got the order to abandon ship. So he swam back, got himself up to deck, and jumped over board when nobody remained on deck of the sinking cruiser. Amikor az úszók eltávolodtak az égő hajótól, Pachner észrevette, hogy a tatfedélzeten van még néhány ember, akik nem kapták meg a hajóelhagyási parancsot. Erre visszaúszott a hajóhoz, felkapaszkodott a fedélzetre és csak azután ugrott ismét a vízbe, amikor már egyetlen élő ember sem tartózkodott a süllyedő cirkálón.a few moments later the bow of the ship went high and at hours with her flags flying on her masts she sunk 5 miles to South-Southwest from Röviddel később a hajó orra a magasba emelkedett, majd az árbocain még mindig lengő lobogókkal kor elsüllyedt 5 mérföldre nyugat-délnyugatra CastellastauCastellaustaától (Petrovac). More than half of her complement, 1 officer and 173 men lost in the battle. Escaped A személyzetnek több mint a fele, 1 tiszt és 173 főnyi legénység vesztette életét az ütközetben. Megmenekült 14 tiszt és officers and 130 főnyi legénységmen. The commander of French Fleet ordered the British destroyers to pick up the swimmers, but the British did not understood the signals (or did not wanted to understand) and left the survivors in the watera francia flotta parancsnoka utasította a brit rombolókat a vízben úszók kimentésére, de a jelzését az angolok nem értették meg, (vagy nem akarták megérteni) és otthagyták a hajótörötteket. They struggled to shore after five hours of swimming, where the Montenegro Army took them as prisoners.az emberek ötórai úszás után vergődtek partra, ahol a montenegróiak fogságába estek. The POWs were liberated only on 15th January 1916, after the capitulation of MontenegroA hadifoglyok csak január 15-én szabadultak ki, Montenegró kapitulációja után. 42\n\n43 SMS ASPERN 43\n\n44 Laid down: 04/10/1897 Builder: Costs: Sister ships: Displacement: Length: Beam: Draught: Machinery: Bunkerage Endurance: Performance: Speed: Armaments: Protection: Others: Launched: 03/05/1899 Commissioned: 29/05/1900 Arsenal, Pola 4,551,014 K ZENTA, SZIGETVÁR 2, t (constr) 2, t (full load) m (wl) / m (oa) m 4.58 m (constr) 5.00 m (full load) 2 four-cylinder triple-expansion vertical steam engines. 8 Yarrow-type water tube boilers, operating pressure 15 atm. 2 outward revolving propellers with 3 blades, diameter: 3.66 m 469 t coal 3,500 nm at 10 kts 8,000 ihp kts 8 quick loading guns, cal: 12 cm/l40; firing rate: 7 shots per minute (2 on main deck, 6 in casemates of battery deck) 8 Skoda-type qf guns, cal: 4.7 cm/l44 2 Hotchkiss-type qf guns, cal: 4.7 cm/l33 2 qf guns, cal: 3.7 cm 2 M/93-type machineguns, cal: 8 mm Two 45 cm torpedo tubes above water line (1-1 on each side) with total 6 torpedoes.
