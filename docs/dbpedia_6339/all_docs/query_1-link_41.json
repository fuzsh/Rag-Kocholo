        "text": "Biogenetically inspired synthesis and skeletal diversification of indole alkaloids.\n\nPubMed\n\nMizoguchi, Haruki; Oikawa, Hideaki; Oguri, Hiroki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo access architecturally complex natural products, chemists usually devise a customized synthetic strategy for constructing a single target skeleton. In contrast, biosynthetic assembly lines often employ divergent intramolecular cyclizations of a polyunsaturated common intermediate to produce diverse arrays of scaffolds. With the aim of integrating such biogenetic strategies, we show the development of an artificial divergent assembly line generating unprecedented numbers of scaffold variations of terpenoid indole alkaloids. This approach not only allows practical access to multipotent intermediates, but also enables systematic diversification of skeletal, stereochemical and functional group properties without structural simplification of naturally occurring alkaloids. Three distinct modes of [4+2] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated annulations provided divergent access to five skeletally distinct scaffolds involving iboga-, aspidosperma-, andranginine- and ngouniensine-type skeletons and a non-natural variant within six to nine steps from tryptamine. The efficiency of our approach was demonstrated by successful total syntheses of (Â±)-vincadifformine, (Â±)-andranginine and (-)-catharanthine.\n\nSynthesis of indolizidinone analogues of cytotoxic alkaloids: monocyclic precursors are also active.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoto, Alicia; MiguÃ©lez, Javier; MarÃ­n, Raquel; DÃ­az, Mario\n\n2012-05-15\n\nReadily available proline derivatives can be transformed in just two steps into analogues of cytotoxic phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids. The key step uses a sequential radical scission-oxidation-alkylation process, which yields 2-substituted pyrrolidine amides. A second process effects the cyclization to give the desired alkaloid analogues, which possess an indolizidine core. The major and minor isomers (dr 3:2 to 3:1) can be easily separated, allowing their use to study structure-activity relationships (SAR). The process is versatile and allows the introduction of aryl and heteroaryl groups (including biphenyl, halogenated phenyl, and pyrrole rings). Some of these alkaloid analogues displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against tumorogenic human neuronal and mammary cancer cells, and one derivative caused around 80% cell death in both tumor lines at micromolar doses. The cytotoxicity of some monocyclic precursors was also studied, being comparable or superior to the bicyclic derivatives. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Given their low toxicity, high selectivity, and environment-friendly properties, the use of natural products and their analogues as algicides has proven to be particularly efficient. In the present study, algicidal activity of naturally occurring bacillamides A-C, alkaloid ( 1 ), and neobacillamide A, as well as their synthetic analogues were investigated intensively. Bioassay results showed that, relative to natural bacillamide alkaloids, aniline-derived analogue ( 10d ) exhibited higher algicidal potential against three freshwater harmful algae Mycrocyctis aeruginosa, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Chlorella pyrenoidosa , suggesting that it could be used as a promising lead compound to develop novel algicide for controlling harmful algal blooms.\n\nAlgicidal Activity of Bacillamide Alkaloids and Their Analogues against Marine and Freshwater Harmful Algae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Bo; Tao, Yuanyuan; Liu, Qisheng; Liu, Na; Jin, Zhong; Xu, Xiaohua\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHarmful algal blooms have become a great challenge to global aquatic ecosystems over the past decades.

Concise syntheses of (+/-)-akuammicine and (+/-)-strychnine.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, M; Clark, C W; Mortimore, M; Goh, J B; Martin, S F\n\n2001-08-22\n\nA linear synthesis of the indole alkaloid (+/-)-akuammicine (2) was completed by a novel sequence of reactions requiring only 10 steps from commercially available starting materials. The approach features a tandem vinylogous Mannich addition and an intramolecular hetero Diels-Alder reaction to rapidly assemble the pentacyclic heteroyohimboid derivative 8 from the readily available hydrocarboline 6. Oxidation of the E ring of 8 gave the lactone 9 that was converted into deformylgeissoschizine (11). The subsequent elaboration of 11 into 2 was effected by a biomimetically patterned transformation that involved sequential oxidation and base-induced skeletal reorganization. A variation of these tactics was then applied to the synthesis of the C(18) hydroxylated akuammicine derivative 36. Because 36 had previously been converted into strychnine (1) in four steps, its preparation constitutes a concise, formal synthesis of this complex alkaloid.\n\nEmulating the logic of monoterpenoid alkaloid biogenesis to access a skeletally diverse chemical library.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Song; Scotti, John S; Kozmin, Sergey A\n\n2013-09-06\n\nWe have developed a synthetic strategy that mimics the diversity-generating power of monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis. Our general approach goes beyond diversification of a single natural product-like substructure and enables production of a highly diverse collection of small molecules. The reaction sequence begins with rapid and highly modular assembly of the tetracyclic indoloquinolizidine core, which can be chemoselectively processed into several additional skeletally diverse structural frameworks. The general utility of this approach was demonstrated by parallel synthesis of two representative chemical libraries containing 847 compounds with favorable physicochemical properties to enable its subsequent broad pharmacological evaluation.\n\nSynthesis and Antiproliferative Activity of 2,5-bis(3â²-Indolyl)pyrroles, Analogues of the Marine Alkaloid Nortopsentin\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCarbone, Anna; Parrino, Barbara; Barraja, Paola; SpanÃ², Virginia; Cirrincione, Girolamo; Diana, Patrizia; Maier, Armin; Kelter, Gerhard; Fiebig, Heinz-Herbert\n\n2013-01-01\n\n2,5-bis(3â²-Indolyl)pyrroles, analogues of the marine alkaloid nortopsentin, were conveniently prepared through a three step procedure in good overall yields. Derivatives 1a and 1b exhibited concentration-dependent antitumor activity towards a panel of 42 human tumor cell lines with mean IC50 values of 1.54 Î¼M and 0.67 Î¼M, respectively. Investigating human tumor xenografts in an ex-vivo clonogenic assay revealed selective antitumor activity, whereas sensitive tumor models were scattered among various tumor histotypes.

W.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSkeletal muscle mechanics exhibit a range of noteworthy characteristics, providing great inspiration for the development of advanced structural and material systems. These characteristics arise from the synergies demonstrated between muscle's constituents across the various length scales. From the macroscale oblique orientation of muscle fibers to the microscale lattice spacing of sarcomeres, muscle takes advantage of geometries and multidimensionality for force generation or length change along a desired axis. Inspired by these behaviors, this research investigates how the incorporation of multidimensionality afforded by oblique, pennate architectures can uncover novel mechanics in structures exhibiting multistability. Experimental investigation of these mechanics is undertaken using specimens of molded silicone rubber with patterned voids, and results reveal tailorable mono-, bi-, and multi-stability under axial displacements by modulation of transverse confinement. If the specimen is considered as an architected material, these results show its ability to generate intriguing, non-monotonic shear stresses. The outcomes would foster the development of novel, advanced mechanical metamaterials that exploit pennation and multidimensionality.\n\nStructure-function relationship of skeletal muscle provides inspiration for design of new artificial muscle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGao, Yingxin; Zhang, Chi\n\n2015-03-01\n\nA variety of actuator technologies have been developed to mimic biological skeletal muscle that generates force in a controlled manner. Force generation process of skeletal muscle involves complicated biophysical and biochemical mechanisms; therefore, it is impossible to replace biological muscle. In biological skeletal muscle tissue, the force generation of a muscle depends not only on the force generation capacity of the muscle fiber, but also on many other important factors, including muscle fiber type, motor unit recruitment, architecture, structure and morphology of skeletal muscle, all of which have significant impact on the force generation of the whole muscle or force transmission from muscle fibers to the tendon. Such factors have often been overlooked, but can be incorporated in artificial muscle design, especially with the discovery of new smart materials and the development of innovative fabrication and manufacturing technologies. A better understanding of the physiology and structure-function relationship of skeletal muscle will therefore benefit the artificial muscle design. In this paper, factors that affect muscle force generation are reviewed. Mathematical models used to model the structure-function relationship of skeletal muscle are reviewed and discussed. We hope the review will provide inspiration for the design of a new generation of artificial muscle by incorporating the structure-function relationship of skeletal muscle into the design of artificial muscle.\n\nStructure-activity relationship of antiparasitic and cytotoxic indoloquinoline alkaloids, and their tricyclic and bicyclic analogues.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Baelen, Gitte; Hostyn, Steven; Dhooghe, Liene; TapolcsÃ¡nyi, PÃ¡l; MÃ¡tyus, PÃ©ter; LemiÃ¨re, Guy; Dommisse, Roger; Kaiser, Marcel; Brun, Reto; Cos, Paul; Maes, Louis; HajÃ³s, GyÃ¶rgy; Riedl, Zsuzsanna; Nagy, IldikÃ³; Maes, Bert U W; Pieters, Luc\n\n2009-10-15\n\nBased on the indoloquinoline alkaloids cryptolepine (1), neocryptolepine (2), isocryptolepine (3) and isoneocryptolepine (4), used as lead compounds for new antimalarial agents, a series of tricyclic and bicyclic analogues, including carbolines, azaindoles, pyrroloquinolines and pyrroloisoquinolines was synthesized and biologically evaluated. None of the bicyclic compounds was significantly active against the chloroquine-resistant strain Plasmodium falciparum K1, in contrast to the tricyclic derivatives. The tricyclic compound 2-methyl-2H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (9), or 2-methyl-beta-carboline, showed the best in vitro activity, with an IC(50) value of 0.45 microM against P. falciparum K1, without apparent cytotoxicity against L6 cells (SI>1000). However, this compound was not active in the Plasmodium berghei mouse model. Structure-activity relationships are discussed and compared with related naturally occurring compounds.\n\nA novel conversion of C(19)-diterpenoid alkaloids into aconane-type diterpenes with eight-membered ring system via skeletal rearrangement of corresponding diazonium derivatives.\n\nPubMed\n\nJi, Hong; Chen, Qiao-Hong; Wang, Feng-Peng\n\n2009-03-01\n\nA new and efficient approach toward the conversion of C(19)-diterpenoid alkaloids into diterpenes with [6+8+5+6] ring system is reported. Treatment of imines 5, 14, and 24 derived from the C(19)-diterpenoid alkaloids with NaNO(2)-NaOAc-HOAc afforded a series of novel rearrangement diterpenes 6-8, 15-19, and 25-27, respectively. The lactone 11 was obtained in 41% yield by treating 5 with NaNO(2)-HBr-Br(2). The formation of diazonium intermediate is postulated, which was subsequently subjected to skeletal rearrangement, leading to the enlargement of B ring. All the new compounds were isolated and fully characterized.\n\nLactam ergot alkaloids (ergopeptams) as predominant alkaloids in sclerotia of Claviceps purpurea from Norwegian wild grasses.\n\nPubMed\n\nUhlig, Silvio; Petersen, Dirk\n\n2008-07-01\n\nFour major alkaloids in the extracts from sclerotia of Claviceps purpurea, picked from wild grasses, have been identified as lactam (non-cyclol) ergot alkaloids. The structural information was obtained from ion trap MS and NMR spectroscopy. The data for one of the lactam ergot alkaloids were coinciding with ergocristam [N-(lysergyl-valyl)-cyclo(phenylalanyl-prolyl)]. The structural information of two further lactam alkaloids was suggestive of either alpha- or beta-ergocryptam [N-(lysergyl-valyl)-cyclo(leucyl-prolyl) or N-(lysergyl-valyl)-cyclo(isoleucyl-prolyl)] and ergoannam [N-(lysergyl-leucyl)-cyclo(leucyl-prolyl) or N-(lysergyl-isoleucyl)-cyclo(isoleucyl-prolyl)]. The constitution of the fourth lactam ergot alkaloid corresponded to N-(lysergyl-isoleucyl)-cyclo(phenylalanyl-prolyl), a new ergopeptam, which has not been described before. Additionally, the cyclol-analogue of the new ergopeptam was detected in the extracts and has been identified on the basis of its product ion spectrum from fragmentation of [M+H](+). The study described in this paper shows that lactam ergot alkaloids may not only be minor products of ergopeptine biosynthesis, as has been suggested hitherto, but may be major biosynthetic endproducts for some ergot strains. This is also the first report demonstrating the production of an ergot alkaloid that contains isoleucine as the second amino acid, i.e. the N-(lysergyl-isoleucyl)-moiety, by parasitic, naturally growing C. purpurea. This unusual type of ergot alkaloid has so far only been found in saprophytic cultures of C. purpurea.\n\nBiogenetically-Inspired Total Synthesis of Epidithiodiketopiperazines and Related Alkaloids\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nConspectus Natural products chemistry has historically been the prime arena for the discovery of new chemical transformations and the fountain of insights into key biological processes. It remains a fervent incubator of progress in the fields of chemistry and biology and an exchange mediating the flow of ideas between these allied fields of science. It is with this ethos that our group has taken an interest in and pursued the synthesis of a complex family of natural products termed the dimeric epipolythiodiketopiperazine (ETP) alkaloids. We present here an Account of the highly complex target molecules to which we pegged our ambitions, our systematic and relentless efforts toward those goals, the chemistry we developed in their pursuit, and the insight we have gained for their translational potential as potent anticancer molecules. The dimeric ETP alkaloids are fungal metabolites that feature a highly complex molecular architecture comprising a densely functionalized core structure with many stereogenic centers, six of which are fully substituted, and a pair of vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters, decorated on polycyclic architectures in addition to the unique ETP motif that has been recognized as acid-, base-, and redox-sensitive. A cyclo-dipeptide consisting of an essential tryptophan residue and a highly variable ancillary amino acid lies at the core of these structures; investigation of the transformations that take this simplistic core to the complex alkaloids lies at the heart of our research program. The dimeric epidithiodiketopiperazine alkaloids have largely resisted synthesis on account of their complexity since the 1970s when the founding members of this class, chaetocin A (HauserD. et al. Helv. Chim. Acta1970, 53, 10615448218) and verticillin A (KatagiriK. et al. J. Antibiot.1970, 23, 4205465723), were first isolated. This was despite their potent cytotoxic and bacteriostatic activities, which were well appreciated at the time of their discovery. In\n\nEnergy capture and storage in asymmetrically multistable modular structures inspired by skeletal muscle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKidambi, Narayanan; Harne, Ryan L.; Wang, K. W.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe remarkable versatility and adaptability of skeletal muscle that arises from the assembly of its nanoscale cross-bridges into micro-scale assemblies known as sarcomeres provides great inspiration for the development of advanced adaptive structures and material systems. Motivated by the capability of cross-bridges to capture elastic strain energy to improve the energetic efficiency of sudden movements and repeated motions, and by models of cross-bridge power stroke motions and sarcomere contractile behaviors that incorporate asymmetric, bistable potential energy landscapes, this research develops and studies modular mechanical structures that trap and store energy in higher-energy configurations. Modules exhibiting tailorable asymmetric bistability are first designed and fabricated, revealing how geometric parameters influence the asymmetry of the resulting double-well energy landscapes. These experimentally-observed characteristics are then investigated with numerical and analytical methods to characterize the dynamics of asymmetrically bistable modules. The assembly of such modules into greater structures generates complex, multi-well energy landscapes with stable system configurations exhibiting different quantities of stored elastic potential energy. Dynamic analyses illustrate the ability of these structures to capture a portion of the initial kinetic energy due to impulsive excitations as recoverable strain potential energy, and reveal how stiffness parameters, damping, and the presence of thermal noise in micro- and nano-scale applications influence energy capture behaviors. The insights gained could foster the development of advanced structural/material systems inspired by skeletal muscle, including actuators that effectively capture, store, and release energy, as well as adaptive, robust, and reusable armors and protective devices.\n\nDesign, synthesis, antiviral activity and mode of action of phenanthrene-containing N-heterocyclic compounds inspired by the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid antofine.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Xiuling; Wei, Peng; Wang, Ziwen; Liu, Yuxiu; Wang, Lizhong; Wang, Qingmin\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid antofine and its analogues have excellent antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). To simplify the structure and the synthesis of the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, a series of phenanthrene-containing N-heterocyclic compounds (compounds 1 to 33) were designed and synthesised, based on the intermolecular interaction of antofine and TMV RNA, and systematically evaluated for their anti-TMV activity. Most of these compounds exhibited good to reasonable anti-TMV activity. The optimum compounds 5, 12 and 21 displayed higher activity than the lead compound antofine and commercial ribavirin. Compound 12 was chosen for field trials of antiviral efficacy against TMV, and was found to exhibit better activity than control plant virus inhibitors. Compounds 5 and 12 were chosen for mode of action studies. The changes in fluorescence intensity of compounds 5 and 12 on separated TMV RNA showed that these small molecules can also bind to TMV RNA, but the mode is very different from that of antofine. The compounds combining phenanthrene and an N-heterocyclic ring could maintain the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroindolizidines, but their modes of action are different from that of antofine. The present study lays a good foundation for us to find more efficient anti-plant virus reagents.

Compounds 1/2 and 3/4 were obtained as C-17 epimeric mixtures due to rapid hemiacetal tautomerism in solution. The structures of 1-5 were established by spectroscopic analysis and with the aid of molecular modeling. The new alkaloids were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in vitro against human tumor HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW-480 cell lines. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Guanidines 10 and 11 presented the highest selectivity index when tested against Leishmania. The antiparasitic activity of 10 and 11 was investigated in host cells and in parasites. Both compounds induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of reactive oxygen species levels, and increased plasma membrane permeability in Leishmania parasites. Immunomodulatory assays suggested an NO-independent effect of guanidines 10 and 11 on macrophages. The same compounds also promoted anti-inflammatory activity in L. (L.) infantum-infected macrophages cocultived with splenocytes, reducing the production of cytokines MCP-1 and IFN-Î³. Guanidines 10 and 11 affect the bioenergetic metabolism of Leishmania, with selective elimination of parasites via a host-independent mechanism.\n\nEffects of Trigonelline, an Alkaloid Present in Coffee, on Diabetes-Induced Disorders in the Rat Skeletal System.\n\nPubMed\n\nFolwarczna, Joanna; Janas, Aleksandra; Pytlik, Maria; CegieÅa, Urszula; ÅliwiÅski, Leszek; KrivoÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡, Zora; Å tefÃ­kovÃ¡, KornÃ©lia; GajdoÅ¡, Martin\n\n2016-03-02\n\nDiabetes increases bone fracture risk. Trigonelline, an alkaloid with potential antidiabetic activity, is present in considerable amounts in coffee. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of trigonelline on experimental diabetes-induced disorders in the rat skeletal system. Effects of trigonelline (50 mg/kg p.o. daily for four weeks) were investigated in three-month-old female Wistar rats, which, two weeks before the start of trigonelline administration, received streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i.p.) or streptozotocin after nicotinamide (230 mg/kg i.p.). Serum bone turnover markers, bone mineralization, and mechanical properties were studied. Streptozotocin induced diabetes, with significant worsening of bone mineralization and bone mechanical properties. Streptozotocin after nicotinamide induced slight glycemia increases in first days of experiment only, however worsening of cancellous bone mechanical properties and decreased vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) were demonstrated. Trigonelline decreased bone mineralization and tended to worsen bone mechanical properties in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In nicotinamide/streptozotocin-treated rats, trigonelline significantly increased BMD and tended to improve cancellous bone strength. Trigonelline differentially affected the skeletal system of rats with streptozotocin-induced metabolic disorders, intensifying the osteoporotic changes in streptozotocin-treated rats and favorably affecting bones in the non-hyperglycemic (nicotinamide/streptozotocin-treated) rats. The results indicate that, in certain conditions, trigonelline may damage bone.\n\nMultidrug resistance-selective antiproliferative activity of Piper amide alkaloids and synthetic analogues.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yue-Hu; Goto, Masuo; Wang, Li-Ting; Hsieh, Kan-Yen; Morris-Natschke, Susan L; Tang, Gui-Hua; Long, Chun-Lin; Lee, Kuo-Hsiung\n\n2014-10-15\n\nTwenty-five amide alkaloids (1-25) from Piper boehmeriifolium and 10 synthetic amide alkaloid derivatives (39-48) were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against eight human tumor cell lines, including chemosensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines. The results suggested tumor type-selectivity. 1-[7-(3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenyl)heptanoyl]piperidine (46) exhibited the best inhibitory activity (IC50=4.94 Î¼M) against the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing KBvin MDR sub-line, while it and all other tested compounds, except 9, were inactive (IC50 >40 Î¼M) against MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) indicated that (i) 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl substitution is critical for selectivity against KBvin, (ii) the 4-methoxy group in this pattern is crucial for antiproliferative activity, (iii) double bonds in the side chain are not needed for activity, and (iv), in arylalkenylacyl amide alkaloids, replacement of an isobutylamino group with pyrrolidin-1-yl or piperidin-1-yl significantly improved activity. Further study on Piper amides is warranted, particularly whether side chain length affects the ability to overcome the MDR cancer phenotype. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the potential of cryptolepine, an alkaloid from the West African shrub Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, as a lead towards new antimalarial agents is discussed. Several cryptolepine analogues have been synthesized that have promising in-vitro and in-vivo antimalarial activity. Studies on the antimalarial modes of action of these analogues indicate that they may have different or additional modes of action to the parent compound. Elucidation of the mode of action may facilitate the development of more potent antimalarial cryptolepine analogues.\n\nProbing Chemical Space with Alkaloid-Inspired Libraries\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcLeod, Michael C.; Singh, Gurpreet; Plampin, James N.; Rane, Digamber; Wang, Jenna L.; Day, Victor W.; AubÃ©, Jeffrey\n\n2014-01-01\n\nScreening of small molecule libraries is an important aspect of probe and drug discovery science. Numerous authors have suggested that bioactive natural products are attractive starting points for such libraries, due to their structural complexity and sp3-rich character. Here, we describe the construction of a screening library based on representative members of four families of biologically active alkaloids (Stemonaceae, the structurally related cyclindricine and lepadiformine families, lupin, and Amaryllidaceae). In each case, scaffolds were based on structures of the naturally occurring compounds or a close derivative. Scaffold preparation was pursued following the development of appropriate enabling chemical methods. Diversification provided 686 new compounds suitable for screening. The libraries thus prepared had structural characteristics, including sp3 content, comparable to a basis set of representative natural products and were highly rule-of-five compliant.

Terpenoid-alkaloids originate from the same prenyl units that construct terpene skeletons. However, during biosynthesis, a nitrogen atom (or atoms) is introduced in the form of Î²-aminoethanol, ethylamine, or methylamine. Nitrogen incorporation can occur either before, during, or after the cyclase phase. The outcome of this unique biosynthesis is the formation of natural products containing unprecedented structures. These complex structural motifs expose current limitations in organic chemistry, thus providing opportunities for invention. This review focuses on total syntheses of terpenoid-alkaloids and unique issues presented by this class of natural products. More specifically, it examines how these syntheses relate to the way terpenoid-alkaloids are made in Nature. Developments in chemistry that have facilitated these syntheses are emphasized, as well as chemical technology needed to conquer those that evade synthesis.\n\nIdentification, occurrence and activity of quinazoline alkaloids in Peganum harmala.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerraiz, TomÃ¡s; GuillÃ©n, Hugo; ArÃ¡n, Vicente J; Salgado, Antonio\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPeganum harmala L. is a medicinal plant from the Mediterranean region and Asia currently used for recreative psychoactive purposes (Ayahuasca analogue), and increasingly involved in toxic cases. Its psychopharmacological and toxicological properties are attributed to quinazoline and Î²-carboline alkaloids. In this work three major quinazoline alkaloids were isolated from P.Â harmala extracts and characterized as peganine (vasicine), deoxypeganine (deoxyvasicine) and a novel compound identified by HPLC-DAD-MS and NMR as peganine Î²-d-glucopyranosyl-(1Â âÂ 6)-Î²-d-glucopyranoside (peganine glycoside). Peganine appeared in flowers and leaves in high levels; high amounts of deoxypeganine and peganine were found in immature and green fruits whereas peganine and peganine glycoside accumulated in high amount in dry seeds reaching up to 1 and 3.9% (w/w), respectively. Roots and stems contained low amount of quinazolines. Seeds extracts containing both quinazoline and Î²-carboline alkaloids potently inhibited human monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A. However, quinazoline alkaloids did not contribute to MAO inhibition that was due to Î²-carbolines, suggesting that MAO-related psychoactive or toxic actions do not arise from quinazolines. Quinazoline alkaloids were poor radical scavengers in the ABTS assay whereas seed extracts had good activity. Quinazoline alkaloids are known to exert bronchodilator and abortifacient actions, and could contribute to such effects reported in P.Â harmala. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, the locomotive behavior of rays (Batoidea) by movement of the pectoral fins is of particular interest due to their superior performance characteristics over contemporary AUV propulsion systems. To better understand the mechanics of pectoral fin propulsion, this paper introduces a biomechanical model that simulates how batoid skeletal structures function to achieve the swimming locomotion observed in nature. Two rays were studied, Dasyatis sabina (Atlantic ray), and Rhinoptera bonasus (cownose ray). These species were selected because they exhibit very different swimming styles (undulation versus oscillation), but all use primarily their pectoral fins for propulsion (unlike electric rays or guitarfishes). Computerized tomography scans of each species were taken to image the underlying structure, which reveal a complex system of cartilaginous joints and linkages. Data collected from these images were used to quantify the complete skeletal morphometry of each batoid fin. Morphological differences were identified in the internal cartilage arrangement between each species including variations in the orientation of the skeletal elements, or radials, and the joint patterns between them, called the inter-radial joint pattern. These data were used as the primary input into the biomechanical model to couple a given ray skeletal structure with various swimming motions. A key output of the model is an estimation of the uniaxial strain that develops in the skeletal connective tissue in order for the structure to achieve motions observed during swimming. Tensile load tests of this connective tissue were conducted to further investigate the implications of the material strain predictions. The model also demonstrates that changes in the skeletal architecture (e.g., joint\n\nMarine Natural Product Bis-indole Alkaloid Caulerpin: Chemistry and Biology.\n\nPubMed\n\nLunagariya, Jignesh; Bhadja, Poonam; Zhong, Shenghui; Vekariya, Rohit; Xu, Shihai\n\n2017-09-27\n\nMarine bis-indole alkaloids comprise a large and increasingly growing class of secondary metabolites, and continue to deliver a great variety of structural templates. The alkaloids derived from marine resources play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry and as chemical agents. In particular, bis-indole alkaloid caulerpin isolated from marine green algae Caulerpa and a red algae Chondria armata at various places around the world, and tested against several therapeutic areas such as anti-diabetic, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-larvicidal, anti-herpes, anti-tubercular, anti-microbial and immunostimulating activity as well as means of other chemical agents. Herein, we summarized discovery of caulerpin, and its potential medicinal and chemical applications in chronological order with various aspects.

They display a remarkable range of biological activities, including anticancer, antioxidant, and vasorelaxation properties as well as elevation of nerve growth factor. Daphenylline is a structurally unique member among the predominately aliphatic Daphniphyllum alkaloids, and contains a tetrasubstituted arene moiety mounted on a sterically compact hexacyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of daphenylline. A gold-catalysed 6-exo-dig cyclization reaction and a subsequent intramolecular Michael addition reaction, inspired by Dixon's seminal work, were exploited to construct the bridged 6,6,5-tricyclic motif of the natural product at an early stage, and the aromatic moiety was forged through a photoinduced olefin isomerization/6Ï-electrocyclization cascade followed by an oxidative aromatization process.\n\nCurvulamine, a new antibacterial alkaloid incorporating two undescribed units from a Curvularia species.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Wen Bo; Lu, Yan Hua; Zhang, Ai Hua; Zhang, Gao Fei; Mei, Ya Ning; Jiang, Nan; Lei, Xinxiang; Song, Yong Chun; Ng, Seik Weng; Tan, Ren Xiang\n\n2014-10-17\n\nThe white croaker (Argyrosomus argentatus) derived Curvularia sp.

Because of this unique property, alkaloid scaffolds are therefore present in several drugs and lead compounds. This review highlights alkaloid scaffolds in drugs, particularly those recently approved in 2012; it also covers the scaffolds in leads and drug candidates which are in clinical trials and preclinical pipeline. The review focuses on three therapeutic areas including treatments of cancer, tuberculosis, and tobacco cessation. Alkaloid scaffolds in drugs and leads are inspired by those of naturally occurring alkaloids, and these scaffolds include pyridine, piperidine, quinoline, quinolinone, quinazoline, isoquinoline, indole, indolinone, isoindole, isoxazole, imidazole, indazole, thiazole, pyrazole, oxazolidinone, oxadiazole, and benzazepine. In addition to medicinal chemistry aspects, natural products possessing an individual alkaloid scaffold, as well as the mechanism of action of drugs and leads, are also discussed in this review.\n\nAlkaloids as a source of potential anticholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonrath, Eduardo Luis; Passos, Carolina dos Santos; Klein, Luiz Carlos; Henriques, AmÃ©lia T\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the key enzyme in the breakdown of acetylcholine, is currently the main pharmacological strategy available for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this sense, many alkaloids isolated from natural sources, such as physostigmine, have been long recognized as acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. Since the approval of galantamine for the treatment of AD patients, the search for new anticholinesterase alkaloids has escalated, leading to promising candidates such as huperzine A. This review aims to summarize recent advances in current knowledge on alkaloids as AChE and BChE inhibitors, highlighting structure-activity relationship (SAR) and docking studies. Natural alkaloids belonging to the steroidal/triterpenoidal, quinolizidine, isoquinoline and indole classes, mainly distributed within Buxaceae, Amaryllidaceae and Lycopodiaceae, are considered important sources of alkaloids with anti-enzymatic properties. Investigations into the possible SARs for some active compounds are based on molecular modelling studies, predicting the mode of interaction of the molecules with amino acid residues in the active site of the enzymes. Following this view, an increasing interest in achieving more potent and effective analogues makes alkaloids good chemical templates for the development of new cholinesterase inhibitors. The anticholinesterase activity of alkaloids, together with their structural diversity and physicochemical properties, makes them good candidate agents for the treatment of AD.

T. Wang, a traditional Chinese herb medicine, led to the isolation of 15 diterpenoid alkaloids, including one new C 19 -diterpenoid alkaloid, sinchiangensine A (1), whose structure was determined by spectral methods including 2D NMR. Additionally, sinchiangensine A and its known analogue 3 were first reported as potential antitumor and antibacterial diterpenoid alkaloids, which showed significant antitumor activities against tumour cells (HL-60, A-549, SMCC-7721, MCF-7 and SW480), with IC 50 comparable to cisplatin, and significant antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-25923 with MIC value of 0.147 and 0.144Â Î¼mol/mL, respectively.\n\nMetabolic effects of the iodothyronine functional analogue TRC150094 on the liver and skeletal muscle of high-fat diet fed overweight rats: an integrated proteomic study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilvestri, Elena; Glinni, Daniela; Cioffi, Federica; Moreno, Maria; Lombardi, Assunta; de Lange, Pieter; Senese, Rosalba; Ceccarelli, Michele; Salzano, Anna Maria; Scaloni, Andrea; Lanni, Antonia; Goglia, Fernando\n\n2012-07-06\n\nA novel functional iodothyronine analogue, TRC150094, which has a much lower potency toward thyroid hormone receptor (Î±1/Î²1) activation than triiodothyronine, has been shown to be effective at reducing adiposity in rats simultaneously receiving a high-fat diet (HFD). Here, by combining metabolic, functional and proteomic analysis, we studied how the hepatic and skeletal muscle phenotypes might respond to TRC150094 treatment in HFD-fed overweight rats. Drug treatment increased both the liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacities without altering mitochondrial efficiency. Coherently, in terms of individual respiratory in-gel activity, blue-native analysis revealed an increased activity of complex V in the liver and of complexes II and V in tibialis muscle in TCR150094-treated animals. Subsequently, the identification of differentially expressed proteins and the analysis of their interrelations gave an integrated view of the phenotypic/metabolic adaptations occurring in the liver and muscle proteomes during drug treatment. TRC150094 significantly altered the expression of several proteins involved in key liver metabolic pathways, including amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism. The canonical pathways most strongly influenced by TRC150094 in tibialis muscle included glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, amino acid, fructose and mannose metabolism, and cell signaling. The phenotypic/metabolic influence of TRC150094 on the liver and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed overweight rats suggests the potential clinical application of this iodothyronine analogue in ameliorating metabolic risk parameters altered by diet regimens.\n\nPropargylation of Ugi Amide Dianion: An Entry into Pyrrolidinone and Benzoindolizidine Alkaloid Analogues.\n\nPubMed\n\nZidan, Alaa; Cordier, Marie; El-Naggar, Abeer M; Abd El-Sattar, Nour E A; Hassan, Mohamed Ali; Ali, Ali Khalil; El KaÃ¯m, Laurent\n\n2018-05-04\n\nPropargylation of Ugi adducts under the addition of excess sodium hydride in DMSO leads to direct formation of pyrrolidinone enamides, which are useful precursors of iminium intermediates and may be trapped by various nucleophiles.

Previously, the neuro-protective activities of the alkaloids from U. rhynchophylla were intensively reported. In current work, three new indole alkaloids (1-3), identified as geissoschizic acid (1), geissoschizic acid N 4 -oxide (2), and 3Î²-sitsirikine N 4 -oxide (3), as well as 26 known analogues were isolated from U. rhynchophylla. However, in the neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation assay for all isolated compounds, geissoschizic acid (1), geissoschizic acid N 4 -oxide (2), isocorynoxeine (6), isorhynchophylline (7), (4S)-akuammigine N-oxide (8), and (4S)-rhynchophylline N-oxide (10) showed unexpected inhibitory activities at 10Â Î¼M.

Algal chemistry has interested many researchers in order to develop new drugs, as algae include compounds with functional groups which are characteristic from this particular source. Among these compounds, alkaloids present special interest because of their pharmacological activities. Alkaloid chemistry has been widely studied in terrestrial plants, but the number of studies in algae is insignificant. In this review, a detailed account of macro algae alkaloids with their structure and pharmacological activities is presented. The alkaloids found in marine algae may be divided into three groups: 1. Phenylethylamine alkaloids, 2. Indole and halogenated indole alkaloids, 3. Other alkaloids.

This study aimed at assessing the applicability of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the indole-diterpene mycotoxin paxilline, in combination with a generic EIA for ergot alkaloids, as alternative parameters for screening purposes. Analysis of grass seeds and model pastures of four different grass species showed that both EIAs yielded highly positive results for paxilline and ergot alkaloids in perennial ryegrass seeds. Furthermore, evidence for natural occurrence of paxilline in grass in Germany was obtained. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis qualitatively confirmed the paxilline EIA results but showed that paxilline analogues 1'-O-acetylpaxilline and 13-desoxypaxilline were the predominant compounds in seeds and grass. In the absence of easily accessible reference standards for specific analysis of some major endophyte toxins, analysis of paxilline and ergot alkaloids by EIA may be suitable substitute parameters. The major advantage of this approach is its ease of use and speed, providing an analytical tool which could enhance routine screening for endophyte toxins in pasture.\n\n[Insecticidal action of synthetic girgensohnine analogues and essential oils on Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)].\n\nPubMed\n\nCuadros, Juliana; CarreÃ±o, Aurora L; Kouznetsov, Vladimir V; Duque, Jonny E\n\n2017-03-29\n\nThe alkaloid girgensohnine has been used as a natural model in the synthesis of new alkaloid-like alpha-aminonitriles with insecticidal effect against disease vectors. To evaluate the biocide activity of girgensohnine analogues and essential oils of Cymbopogon flexuosus, Citrus sinensis and Eucalyptus citriodora in stage I and stage V Rhodnius prolixus nymphs. We used a topical application model in tergites and sternites, as well as exposure to treated surfaces with different exploratory doses of each of the molecules and essential oils to determine the lethal doses (LD50 and LD95). Analogue 3 showed the highest insecticidal activity with 83.3Â±16.7% of mortality when applied on tergites, 38.9Â±4.8% on sternites and 16.7Â±0% on treated surfaces in stage I nymphs at 72 hours (h) and 500 mg.L-1. In stage V nymphs, the compounds induced mortality only in sternums (11.1Â±9.6% for analogue 6 and 5.5Â±4.7% for analogues 3 and 7 at 72 h and 1500 mg.L-1). The lethal doses for molecule 3 on tergites in stage I nymphs were LD50 225.60 mg.L-1 and LD95 955.90 mg.L-1. The insecticidal effect of essential oils was observed only in stage I nymphs, with 11.1Â±4.8% for C. flexuosus when applied in sternites, while using exposure to surfaces treated it was 5.6Â±4.8% for C. sinensis applied on tergites and 8.3Â±0% on sternites at 72 h and 1000 mg.L-1. Synthetic girgensohnine analogues, and C. flexuosus and C. sinensis essential oils showed insecticidal activity in R. prolixus.

In order to investigate the different metabolism pathways of these compounds in five species of liver microsomes in vitro, the data of full mass spectrum, and MS2, MS3 spectra of these three alkaloids were collected and analyzed by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a LTQ-orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS); gragment ion information was collected and combined with fragmentation regularities of mass spectra and accurate mass spectrometry data of metabolites, to compare the metabolism difference of three amide alkaloids in liver microsomes of human, rhesus monkey, Beagle dogs, rats and mice. 3 metabolites of piperine, 2 metabolites of piperlonguminine and 1 metabolite of pellitorine were identified quickly. The results showed that the major metabolic pathways of these amide alkaloids in liver microsomes were methylenedioxy group demethylation and oxidation reaction, and metabolic rates were different between species. This study provides basis for further research on in vivo metabolism of piperine analogues from Piper longum.

To evaluate the pharmacological potential of the CT side-chain analogues CB1093 and GS1500, we compared their fast effects on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in chick skeletal muscle cells with those elicited by the natural hormone.Both analogues, similarly to CT, specifically induced rapid (30â60âs) and sustained rises in [Ca2+]i levels. CB1093 and GS1500 were more potent than the natural hormone at concentrations as low as 10â13 M (4.5 fold stimulation) and 10â12 M (2.5 fold), respectively, whereas higher concentrations (10â9â10â8âM) of CT were more effective than the analogues in elevating [Ca2+]i. Cyclic AMP was markedly increased by both analogues pointing for a role of this messenger in the fast actions of the synthetic compounds.In Ca2+ free medium CT and analogues elicited a transient elevation in [Ca2+]i. The PLC inhibitors U73122 (2âÎ¼M) and neomycin (0.5âmM), as well as depletion of intracellular stores with thapsigargin (1âÎ¼M), completely prevented CB1093/GS1500-dependent changes in [Ca2+]i suggesting that, similarly to CT, these analogues mobilized Ca2+ from an IP3/thapsigargin-sensitive store.The voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blocker nifedipine (2âÎ¼M) reduced by 50â60% the influx phase of the [Ca2+]i response to CB1093 and GS1500, indicating that VDCC contributed partially to Ca2+ entry. The Ca2+ readdition protocol suggested that analogue-dependent activation of a SOC entry pathway accounted, to the same extent as for CT, for the remaining non-VDCC mediated Ca2+ influx.

These indole alkaloids are widely dispersed in 25 plant genera, principally in the Apocynaceae family. Very diverse and interesting biological properties have been reported for this group of natural products. Isolation of new sarpagine-related alkaloids as well as the asymmetric synthesis of these structurally complex molecules are of paramount importance to the synthetic and medicinal chemists. A total of 115 newly isolated sarpagine-related macroline and ajmaline alkaloids, along with their physicochemical properties have been included in this chapter. A general and efficient strategy for the synthesis of these monomeric alkaloids, as well as bisindoles has been presented, which involves application of the asymmetric PictetâSpengler reaction (>98% ee) as a key step because of the ease of scale up of the tetracyclic template. Also included in this chapter are the syntheses of the sarpagine-related alkaloids, published since the year 2000.

Modifying the structure of a natural product often improves the biological activity of the compound. Metabolic engineering strategies to ferment \"unnatural\" products have been enormously successful in microbial organisms. However, despite the importance of plant derived natural products, metabolic engineering strategies to yield unnatural products from complex, lengthy plant pathways have not been widely explored. Here, we show that RNA mediated suppression of tryptamine biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus hairy root culture eliminates all production of monoterpene indole alkaloids, a class of natural products derived from two starting substrates, tryptamine and secologanin. To exploit this chemically silent background, we introduced an unnatural tryptamine analog to the production media and demonstrated that the silenced plant culture could produce a variety of novel products derived from this unnatural starting substrate. The novel alkaloids were not contaminated by the presence of the natural alkaloids normally present in C. roseus. Suppression of tryptamine biosynthesis therefore did not appear to adversely affect expression of downstream biosynthetic enzymes. Targeted suppression of substrate biosynthesis therefore appears to be a viable strategy for programming a plant alkaloid pathway to more effectively produce desirable unnatural products. Moreover, although tryptamine is widely found among plants, this silenced line demonstrates that tryptamine does not play an essential role in growth or development in C. roseus root culture. Silencing the biosynthesis of an early starting substrate enhances our ability to harness the rich diversity of plant based natural products.\n\nCatharanthus alkaloids XXXII: isolation of alkaloids from Catharanthus trichophyllus roots and structure elucidation of cathaphylline.\n\nPubMed\n\nCordell, G A; Farnsworth, N R\n\n1976-03-01\n\nFurther examination of the cytotoxic alkaloid fractions of Catharanthus trichophyllus roots afforded nine alkaloids.

These species, collectively referred to as 'poison frogs,' form a polyphyletic assemblage that includes some species of Dendrobatidae, Mantellidae, Myobatrachidae, Bufonidae, and Eleutherodactylidae. The ability to sequester alkaloids from dietary arthropods has been demonstrated experimentally in most poison frog lineages but not in bufonid or eleutherodactylid poison frogs. As with other poison frogs, species of the genus Melanophryniscus (Bufonidae) consume large numbers of mites and ants, suggesting they might also sequester defensive alkaloids from dietary sources. To test this hypothesis, fruit flies dusted with alkaloid/nutritional supplement powder were fed to individual Melanophryniscus stelzneri in two experiments. In the first experiment, the alkaloids 5,8-disubstituted indolizidine 235B' and decahydroquinoline were administered to three individuals for 104 days. In the second experiment, the alkaloids 3,5-disubstituted indolizidine 239Q and decahydroquinoline were given to three frogs for 153 days. Control frogs were fed fruit flies dusted only with nutritional supplement. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses revealed that skin secretions of all experimental frogs contained alkaloids, whereas those of all control frogs lacked alkaloids. Uptake of decahydroquinoline was greater than uptake of 5,8-disubstituted indolizidine, and uptake of 3,5-disubstituted indolizidine was greater than uptake of decahydroquinoline, suggesting greater uptake efficiency of certain alkaloids. Frogs in the second experiment accumulated a greater amount of alkaloid, which corresponds to the longer duration and greater number of alkaloid-dusted fruit flies that were consumed. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that bufonid poison frogs sequester alkaloid-based defenses from dietary\n\nQuinolizidine alkaloids from Lupinus lanatus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeto, Alexandre T.; Oliveira, Carolina Q.; Ilha, Vinicius; Pedroso, Marcelo; Burrow, Robert A.; Dalcol, Ionara I.; Morel, Ademir F.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nIn this study, one new quinolizidine alkaloid, lanatine A ( 1), together with three other known alkaloids, 13-Î±- trans-cinnamoyloxylupanine ( 2), 13-Î±-hydroxylupanine ( 3), and (-)-multiflorine ( 4) were isolated from the aerial parts of Lupinus lanatus (Fabaceae). The structures of alkaloids 1- 4 were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. The stereochemistry of 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. Bayesian statistical analysis of the Bijvoet differences suggests the absolute stereochemistry of 1. In addition, the antimicrobial potential of alkaloids 1- 4 is also reported.\n\nBrassicaceae contain nortropane alkaloids.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrock, Andrea; Herzfeld, Tobias; Paschke, Reinhard; Koch, Marcus; DrÃ¤ger, Birgit\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThe report of cochlearine, the 3-hydroxybenzoate ester of tropine found in Cochlearia officinalis, Brassicaceae, initiated a screening for tropane alkaloids in Cochlearia species and for calystegines in further Brassicaceae. All ten Cochlearia species investigated contained cochlearine, tropine, and pseudotropine. Calystegines, nortropane alkaloids deriving from pseudotropine, were also identified in all Cochlearia species and accumulated up to 0.5% dry mass in leaves. Brassicaceae species of all major lineages of the family were analysed for calystegines. Of the 43 species included in the study, 18 accumulated calystegines of various structures. This is the first screening of Brassicaceae for products of the tropane alkaloid pathway, which is known as characteristic for plants of Solanaceae family. The identification of calystegines in all branches of the Brassicaceae family including Aethionema, a species at the basis of the family, suggests tropane alkaloids as secondary compound typical for Brassicaceae.\n\nErgot alkaloid transport across ruminant gastric tissues.\n\nPubMed\n\nHill, N S; Thompson, F N; Stuedemann, J A; Rottinghaus, G W; Ju, H J; Dawe, D L; Hiatt, E E\n\n2001-02-01\n\nErgot alkaloids cause fescue toxicosis when livestock graze endophyte-infected tall fescue. It is generally accepted that ergovaline is the toxic component of endophyte-infected tall fescue, but there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. The objective of this study was to examine relative and potential transport of ergoline and ergopeptine alkaloids across isolated gastric tissues in vitro. Sheep ruminal and omasal tissues were surgically removed and placed in parabiotic chambers. Equimolar concentrations of lysergic acid, lysergol, ergonovine, ergotamine, and ergocryptine were added to a Kreb's Ringer phosphate (KRP) solution on the mucosal side of the tissue. Tissue was incubated in near-physiological conditions for 240 min. Samples were taken from KRP on the serosal side of the chambers at times 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min and analyzed for ergot alkaloids by competitive ELISA. The serosal KRP remaining after incubation was freeze-dried and the alkaloid species quantified by HPLC. The area of ruminal and omasal tissues was measured and the potential transportable alkaloids calculated by multiplying the moles of transported alkaloids per square centimeter of each tissue type by the surface area of the tissue. Studies were conducted to compare alkaloid transport in reticular, ruminal, and omasal tissues and to determine whether transport was active or passive. Ruminal tissue had greater ergot alkaloid transport potential than omasal tissue (85 vs 60 mmol) because of a larger surface area. The ruminal posterior dorsal sac had the greatest potential for alkaloid transport, but the other ruminal tissues were not different from one another. Alkaloid transport was less among reticular tissues than among ruminal tissues. Transport of alkaloids seemed to be an active process. The alkaloids with greatest transport potential were lysergic acid and lysergol. Ergopeptine alkaloids tended to pass across omasal tissues in greater quantities than across ruminal\n\nIndentification of vincamine indole alkaloids producing endophytic fungi isolated from Nerium indicum, Apocynaceae.\n\nPubMed\n\nNa, Ren; Jiajia, Liu; Dongliang, Yang; Yingzi, Peng; Juan, Hong; Xiong, Liu; Nana, Zhao; Jing, Zhou; Yitian, Luo\n\n2016-11-01\n\nVincamine, a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid which had been marketed as nootropic drugs for the treatment of cerebral insufficiencies, is widely found in plants of the Apocynaceae family. Nerium indicum is a plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. So, the purpose of this research was designed to investigate the vincamine alkaloids producing endophytic fungi from Nerium indicum, Apocynaceae. 11 strains of endophytic fungi, isolated from the stems and roots of the plant, were grouped into 5 genera on the basis of morphological characteristics. All fungal isolates were fermented and their extracts were preliminary screened by Dragendorff's reagent and thin layer chromatography (TLC). One isolated strain CH1, isolated from the stems of Nerium indicum, had the same Rf value (about 0.56) as authentic vincamine. The extracts of strain CH1 were further analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the results showed that the strain CH1 could produce vincamine and vincamine analogues. The acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitory activity assays using Ellman's method revealed that the metabolites of strain CH1 had significant AchE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 5.16Î¼g/mL. The isolate CH1 was identified as Geomyces sp. based on morphological and molecular identification, and has been deposited in the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCCM 2014676). This study first reported the natural compounds tabersonine and ethyl-vincamine from endophytic fungi CH1, Geomyces sp. In conclusion, the fungal endophytes from Nerium indicum can be used as alternative source for the production of vincamine and vincamine analogues. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The analogues have comparable cytotoxicity (nanomolar) to that of BBA, and cellular morphology assays indicated that they target the actin cytoskeleton. Pathway inhibition in human colon tumour (HCT116) cells was explored by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis, which showed a doseâdependent response in IRSâ1 expression. Alanine scanning reveals a structural dependence to the cytotoxicity, actin targeting and pathway inhibition, and allows a new readily synthesised lead to be proposed.

Three of them, N-(4-methoxy-3,5-di-tert-butylbenzyl)cinchonidinium bromide (OSL-5), O-benzyl-N-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxybenzyl)cinchonidinium bromide (OSL-7), and N-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxybenzyl)quininium bromide (OSL-14) show potent activity against Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nNatural product-inspired cascade synthesis yields modulators of centrosome integrity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDÃ¼ckert, Heiko; Pries, Verena; Khedkar, Vivek; Menninger, Sascha; Bruss, Hanna; Bird, Alexander W; Maliga, Zoltan; Brockmeyer, Andreas; Janning, Petra; Hyman, Anthony; Grimme, Stefan; SchÃ¼rmann, Markus; Preut, Hans; HÃ¼bel, Katja; Ziegler, Slava; Kumar, Kamal; Waldmann, Herbert\n\n2011-12-25\n\nIn biology-oriented synthesis, the scaffolds of biologically relevant compound classes inspire the synthesis of focused compound collections enriched in bioactivity. This criterion is, in particular, met by the scaffolds of natural products selected in evolution. The synthesis of natural product-inspired compound collections calls for efficient reaction sequences that preferably combine multiple individual transformations in one operation. Here we report the development of a one-pot, twelve-step cascade reaction sequence that includes nine different reactions and two opposing kinds of organocatalysis. The cascade sequence proceeds within 10-30 min and transforms readily available substrates into complex indoloquinolizines that resemble the core tetracyclic scaffold of numerous polycyclic indole alkaloids. Biological investigation of a corresponding focused compound collection revealed modulators of centrosome integrity, termed centrocountins, which caused fragmented and supernumerary centrosomes, chromosome congression defects, multipolar mitotic spindles, acentrosomal spindle poles and multipolar cell division by targeting the centrosome-associated proteins nucleophosmin and Crm1.\n\nSynthesis, biological evaluation and molecular modeling of GW 501516 analogues.\n\nPubMed\n\nCiocoiu, Calin C; Ravna, Aina W; Sylte, Ingebrigt; Hansen, Trond Vidar\n\n2010-11-01\n\nEleven analogues of GW 501516 (1) were prepared and subjected to biological testing in a semi-high throughput human skeletal muscle cell assay. The assay testing indicated that all analogues elicited oxidation of oleic acid. Among the most potent agonists, 2e (2-{2-ethyl-4-[(4-methyl-2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)thiazol-5-yl)methylthio]phenoxy}-2-methylpropanoic acid), was also subjected to a luciferase-based transfection assay, which showed that this compound is a potent agonist against PPARÎ´ and a moderate agonist against PPARÎ±. Docking of compound 2e into PPARÎ´ revealed that it occupied the agonist binding site and exhibited key hydrogen bonding interactions with His323, His449, and Tyr473.\n\nAlkaloids as Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors in Anticancer Drug Discovery.\n\nPubMed\n\nHashmi, Muhammad Ali; Khan, Afsar; Farooq, Umar; Khan, Sehroon\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCancer is the leading cause of death worldwide and anticancer drug discovery is a very hot area of research at present. There are various factors which control and affect cancer, out of which enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) play a vital role in the growth of tumor cells. Inhibition of this enzyme is a very useful target for the prevention of various types of cancers. Alkaloids are a diverse group of naturally occurring compounds which have shown great COX-2 inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this mini-review, we have discussed different alkaloids with COX-2 inhibitory activities and anticancer potential which may act as leads in modern anticancer drug discovery. Different classes of alkaloids including isoquinoline alkaloids, indole alkaloids, piperidine alkaloids, quinazoline alkaloids, and various miscellaneous alkaloids obtained from natural sources have been discussed in detail in this review.

Their diverse biological activities make many compounds of this class attractive starting points for pharmaceutical development. Several marine-derived indoles were found to possess cytotoxic, antineoplastic, antibacterial and antimicrobial activities, in addition to the action on human enzymes and receptors. The newly isolated indole alkaloids of marine origin since the last comprehensive review in 2003 are reported, and biological aspects will be discussed.

The best known producers are fungi of the phylum Ascomycota, e.g., Claviceps, EpichloÃ«, Penicillium and Aspergillus species. According to their structures, ergot alkaloids can be divided into three groups: clavines, lysergic acid amides and peptides (ergopeptines). All of them share the first biosynthetic steps, which lead to the formation of the tetracyclic ergoline ring system (except the simplest, tricyclic compound: chanoclavine). Different modifications on the ergoline ring by specific enzymes result in an abundance of bioactive natural products, which are used as pharmaceutical drugs or precursors thereof. From the 1950s through to recent years, most of the biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated. Gene clusters from several ergot alkaloid producers have been identified by genome mining and the functions of many of those genes have been demonstrated by knock-out experiments or biochemical investigations of the overproduced enzymes.\n\nTulongicin, an Antibacterial Tri-Indole Alkaloid from a Deep-Water Topsentia sp. Sponge.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Hong-Bing; Lauro, Gianluigi; O'Connor, Robert D; Lohith, Katheryn; Kelly, Michelle; Colin, Patrick; Bifulco, Giuseppe; Bewley, Carole A\n\n2017-09-22\n\nAntibacterial-guided fractionation of an extract of a deep-water Topsentia sp. marine sponge led to the isolation of two new indole alkaloids, tulongicin A (1) and dihydrospongotine C (2), along with two known analogues, spongotine C (3) and dibromodeoxytopsentin (4). Their planar structures were determined by NMR spectroscopy. Their absolute configurations were determined through a combination of experimental and computational analyses. Tulongicin (1) is the first natural product to contain a di(6-Br-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl group linked to an imidazole core. The coexistence of tri-indole 1 and bis-indole alcohol 2 suggests a possible route to 1. All of the compounds showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nCongenital skeletal malformations and cleft palate induced in goats by ingestion of Lupinus, Conium and Nicotiana species.\n\nPubMed\n\nPanter, K E; Keeler, R F; Bunch, T D; Callan, R J\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThree piperidine alkaloid containing plants, Conium maculatum (poison-hemlock), Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) and Lupinus formosus (lunara lupine), induced multiple congenital contractures (MCC) and palatoschisis in goat kids when their dams were gavaged with the plant during gestation days 30-60. The skeletal abnormalities included fixed extension or flexure of the carpal, tarsal, and fetlock joints, scoliosis, lordosis, torticollis and rib cage abnormalities. Clinical signs of toxicity included those reported in sheep, cattle and pigs--ataxia, incoordination, muscular weakness, prostration and death. One quinolizidine alkaloid containing plant, Lupinus caudatus (tailcup lupine), on the other hand, which is also known to cause MCC in cows, caused only slight signs of toxicity in pregnant goats and no teratogenic effects in their offspring.\n\nFrom ice-binding proteins to bio-inspired antifreeze materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nVoets, I K\n\n2017-07-19\n\nIce-binding proteins (IBP) facilitate survival under extreme conditions in diverse life forms. IBPs in polar fishes block further growth of internalized environmental ice and inhibit ice recrystallization of accumulated internal crystals. Algae use IBPs to structure ice, while ice adhesion is critical for the Antarctic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis. Successful translation of this natural cryoprotective ability into man-made materials holds great promise but is still in its infancy. This review covers recent advances in the field of ice-binding proteins and their synthetic analogues, highlighting fundamental insights into IBP functioning as a foundation for the knowledge-based development of cheap, bio-inspired mimics through scalable production routes. Recent advances in the utilisation of IBPs and their analogues to e.g. improve cryopreservation, ice-templating strategies, gas hydrate inhibition and other technologies are presented.\n\nbeta-Phenylethylamines and the isoquinoline alkaloids.\n\nPubMed\n\nBentley, Kenneth W\n\n2005-04-01\n\nThis review covers beta-phenylethylamines and isoquinoline alkaloids derived from them, including further products of oxidation, condensation with formaldehyde and rearrangement, some of which do not contain as isoquinoline system, together with napthylisoquinoline alkaloids, which have a different biogenetic origin.

Specific emphasis is focused on evaluating the function and activities of these cells in the context of development in vivo, and how technologies and methods of stem cell-based tissue engineering for stem cells must draw inspiration from developmental biology. Information on the embryonic origin and in vivo differentiation of skeletal tissues is first reviewed, to shed light on the persistence and activities of adult stem cells that remain in skeletal tissues after embryogenesis. Next, the development and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells is discussed, and some of their advantages and disadvantages in the context of tissue engineering is presented. The final section highlights current use of multipotent adult mesenchymal stem cells, reviewing their origin, differentiation capacity, and potential applications to tissue engineering.

These teratogenic effects include multiple congenital contracture (MCC) deformities and cleft palate in cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. Poisonous plants containing teratogenic piperidine alkaloids include poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), lupine (Lupinus spp.), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) [including wild tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca)]. There is abundant epidemiological evidence in humans that link maternal tobacco use with a high incidence of oral clefting in newborns; this association may be partly attributable to the presence of piperidine alkaloids in tobacco products. In this review, we summarize the evidence for piperidine alkaloids that act as teratogens in livestock, piperidine alkaloid structure-activity relationships and their potential implications for human health.

Compound 5f with minimumbiofilm inhibitory concentration(MBIC) of 0.39, 0.78 and 3.125 Î¼g/mL against MSSA, MRSA and SE respectively, emerged as promising anti-biofilm lead compounds. In addition, compounds 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5h, 5i and 5j revealed equal potency as that of the standard drug Vancomycin (MBIC = 3.125 Î¼g/mL) against Streptococcus epidermidis. Notably, most of the synthesized compounds displayed better potency than Vancomycin indicating their potential as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm.

Skeletal muscle tissue and adipocyte tissue are the major sites of postprandial glucose disposal, and enhancing glucose uptake into this tissue may decrease insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes patients. Mahanine (3,11-dihydro-3,5-dimethyl-3-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)pyrano[3,2-a]carbazol-9-ol) has been reported to be a major bioactive carbazole alkaloid that has many biological activities including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities. However, the molecular mechanism and signaling pathways mediating the anti-diabetic effects of mahanine require further investigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid from Murraya koenigii, on glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle and adipocyte cells. Mahanine treatment promoted a dose dependent increased in glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and adipocyte cells via activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Mahanine induced Akt-activation was reversed by co-treatment with wortmannin, an Akt inhibitor. Moreover, it was found that mahanine significantly enhanced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. These results suggest that increased activation of the Akt signaling pathway lead to increased plasma membrane GLUT4 content and increased glucose uptake. These data strongly suggest that mahanine has anti-diabetic potential for treating diabetes. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The teratogenic effects in groups dosed during gestation days 43 through 53 were more severe than those in groups dosed during the later period, with many newborn pigs showing arthrogryposis and twisted and malaligned bones in the limbs and with 1 pig showing scoliosis and deformity of the thoracic cage. The pigs born to gilts given C maculatum during gestation days 51 through 61 had excessive flexure primarily in the carpal joints, without scoliosis or bone malalignment in the limbs. The teratogenicity of poison hemlock depends on the alkaloid concentration and content. Based on the data presented, we speculate that gamma-coniceine is the teratogenic alkaloid in the poison hemlock fed to the gilts.\n\nAlkaloids from Isopyrum thalictroides L.\n\nPubMed\n\nIstatkova, Ralitsa; Philipov, Stefan\n\n2004-06-01\n\nTwo new aporphine-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids thaliphine and isothaliphine with a new type of ether bridge were isolated from the roots and rhyzomes of Isopyrum thalictroides L.

Successful translation of this natural cryoprotective ability into man-made materials holds great promise but is still in its infancy. This review covers recent advances in the field of ice-binding proteins and their synthetic analogues, highlighting fundamental insights into IBP functioning as a foundation for the knowledge-based development of cheap, bio-inspired mimics through scalable production routes. Recent advances in the utilisation of IBPs and their analogues to e.g. improve cryopreservation, ice-templating strategies, gas hydrate inhibition and other technologies are presented.

Their structures were determined on the basis of analysis of spectroscopic data.\n\nSynthesis and biological evaluation of febrifugine analogues as potential antimalarial agents.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Shuren; Zhang, Quan; Gudise, Chandrashekar; Wei, Lai; Smith, Erika; Zeng, Yuling\n\n2009-07-01\n\nFebrifugine is an alkaloid isolated from Dichroa febrifuga Lour as the active component against Plasmodium falciparum. Adverse side effects have precluded febrifugine as a potential clinical drug. In this study novel febrifugine analogues were designed and synthesized. Lower toxicity was achieved by reducing or eliminating the tendency of forming chemically reactive and toxic intermediates and metabolites. Synthesized compounds were evaluated for acute toxicity and in vitro and in vivo antimalarial efficacy. Some compounds are much less toxic than the natural product febrifugine and existing antimalarial drug chloroquine and are expected to possess wide therapeutic windows. These compounds, as well as the underlying design rationale, may find usefulness in the discovery and development of new antimalarial drugs.\n\nInspiration for wing design: how forelimb specialization enables active flight in modern vertebrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nChin, Diana D; Matloff, Laura Y; Stowers, Amanda Kay; Tucci, Emily R; Lentink, David\n\n2017-06-01\n\nHarnessing flight strategies refined by millions of years of evolution can help expedite the design of more efficient, manoeuvrable and robust flying robots. This review synthesizes recent advances and highlights remaining gaps in our understanding of how bird and bat wing adaptations enable effective flight. Included in this discussion is an evaluation of how current robotic analogues measure up to their biological sources of inspiration. Studies of vertebrate wings have revealed skeletal systems well suited for enduring the loads required during flight, but the mechanisms that drive coordinated motions between bones and connected integuments remain ill-described. Similarly, vertebrate flight muscles have adapted to sustain increased wing loading, but a lack of in vivo studies limits our understanding of specific muscular functions. Forelimb adaptations diverge at the integument level, but both bird feathers and bat membranes yield aerodynamic surfaces with a level of robustness unparalleled by engineered wings. These morphological adaptations enable a diverse range of kinematics tuned for different flight speeds and manoeuvres. By integrating vertebrate flight specializations-particularly those that enable greater robustness and adaptability-into the design and control of robotic wings, engineers can begin narrowing the wide margin that currently exists between flying robots and vertebrates. In turn, these robotic wings can help biologists create experiments that would be impossible in vivo .
