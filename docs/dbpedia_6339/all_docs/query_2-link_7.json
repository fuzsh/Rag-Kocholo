        "text": "Hungarian Olympic Triumph!\n\nby Bryan Dawson\n\nDid you know...as of 2016, Hungary ranks 8th in the world in medals at the Summer Olympic Games despite its being torn apart after WWI and losing half her population and 2/3 of her territory. This does not include an additional 6 medals won in the Winter Olympics nor the Hungarians that won medals as nationals of other countries after borders were redrawn or after large-scale emigration.\n\nFerenc Kemeny,\n\nfounding\n\nmember of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe beginnings of the Olympic movement in Hungary go back further than the Games in Athens. Ferenc Kemeny, a great pacifist and member of the International Peace Bureau, was one of Pierre de Coubertin's first kindred spirits, with whom he struck up a friendship in the 1880's.\n\nKemeny took an active part in the Congress for the re-establishment of the Games held in Paris in 1894 and was one of the founding members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin supported Kemeny's suggestion to hold the first Olympics in Budapest in 1896 in honor of Hungary's 1000 years of statehood. While the dream of hosting an Olympics is not yet realized, Hungary has won more Olympic medals than any other nation that has never hosted the Games.\n\nHungary in the Olympics - Select a Year:\n\nFeatured 1948 Olympians\n\nFeatured Olympian,\n\nKaroly Takacs:\n\n(b. Budapest, 1/21/1910, d. 1/5/1976)\n\nThe Right-Handed Shooter Who Won With His Left Hand...this \"handicapped\" Olympian would become the first repeat Gold Medal winner of the rapid-fire pistol event! Karoly Takacs was a member of the Hungarian pistol shooting team in 1938 when, while serving as a sergeant in the army, a defective grenade exploded in his right hand - his pistol hand - and shattered it completely. After spending a month in the hospital, Takacs secretly taught himself to shoot with his left hand.\n\nThe following year he won the Hungarian pistol shooting championship and was a member of the Hungarian team that won the automatic pistol event at the world championships. The next two Olympics, in 1940 and 1944, were cancelled because of war, but in 1948 Takacs qualified for the Hungarian Olympic team in the rapid-fire pistol event. He was 38 years old. Before the competition, the favorite, world champion and world record holder, Carlos Enrique Díaz Saenz Valiente, asked Takacs why he was in London. Takacs replied, \"I'm here to learn.\" Takacs won the gold medal and beat the world record by ten points. During the medal ceremony, Díaz Saenz Valiente, who finished second, turned to Takacs and said, \"You have learned enough.\" Four years later in Helsinki, Takács successfully defended his Olympic title to become the first repeat winner of the rapid-fire pistol event.\n\nHungary, with its great sporting culture, has a proud history of medal winning \"Handicapped\" Olympians. Amputee Oliver Halassy won two Gold Medals in Waterpolo in 1932 and 1936 and a Silver in 1928. Fencer Rejto Ildiko, a triumphant \"handicapped\" Icon, and winner of 7 Olympic Medals (two Gold), was still a Champion in 1999! Rejto participated in FIVE Olympics - 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, and 1976 - and won 7 medals!\n\nLaszlo Papp:\n\n(b. 3/25/1926 Budapest)\n\nA Tragic Champion...\n\nAfter winning the Olympic middleweight title in 1948 Hungary's László Papp (Papp Laci) won the light-middleweight crown in 1952 and 1956 to become the first boxer to win three Olympic gold medals in 1948, 1952, and 1956 (only the great Teofilo Stevenson of Cuba could later match this feat). He also won European amateur titles in 1949 and 1951. Possibly his finest victory in the Olympic ring came in the 1956 final when he beat José Torres (USA), a future world professional champion. A skillful, hard-punching southpaw, Papp was the first fighter from the Soviet bloc allowed to turn professional and he won the European middleweight title in 1962. He would eventually amass 6 European Middleweight Titles (1962-1965). However, in 1965, the communist Hungarian authorities withdrew their permission for him to fight professionally and the chance of a world title bout was denied him. Papp later served as the coach of the Hungarian national boxing team from 1971-92.\n\nClick for larger images"
