        "meta_description": "Abstract We present the results of the environmental historical and geoarchaeological analysis of Rákóczifalva-Bagi- földek and Rákóczifalva-Rokkant-földek archeological sites in Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County.1 They were discovered in the course of several hectares of archaeological excavations related to the Roman Age and Migration Period, especially the Sarmatian and the Gepids era. A significant number of Gepids sites and finds2 were found in both the investigated areas and the wider area of the site, in the middle reach of the Tisza valley. So the geoarchaeological and environmental historical analysis of the Sarmatian and Late-Sarmatian and Gepids sites in Rákóczifalva can also provide a model for the settling strategy and lifestyle of the Sarmatian and Gepids communities.3 The purpose of our work is to present how geoarchaeological and environmental historical factors impacted local settling and lifestyles in the Gepids communities and Sarmatian-Late Sarmatian communities as well4 during the Roman Age and the Migration Period. In addition, to demonstrate the relationship of the Sarmatian and Gepids communities and their environment in the Rákóczifalva site compared to other Gepids5 and Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian communities in the Great Hungarian Plain.6 Based on the number of objects containing animal bones and the amount of bones found in them, we can reconstruct considerable settling in the Celtic, Sarmatian, Gepids, Avar and Arpadian periods. The number of objects from the Linear Pottery culture (Great Hungarian Plain) and the Bodrogkeresztúr culture is high; however, the number of animal bones is low. On the basis of the bones discovered, we can count on a smaller settlement during the Tiszapolgár culture, the Hunyadihalom group, the Halomíros culture, the Gava culture and during the Scythians period. In this paper, we present the results of the Sarmatian, Late Sarmatian and the Gepid findings since the largest number of animal bones (except the Avar period) turned up from these periods. Our aim was to compare the animal husbandry, meat consumption and hunting habits of the Oriental origin Sarmatians and the Germanic Gepids communities. Bone artefacts and bone anvils have been found in the archaeological material of both ethnic groups.",

        "text": "Archaeozoological analysis\n\nThe vertebrate fauna analysis from the Sarmatian, Late Sarmatian and Gepids objects supported the combined use of the deeper Tisza alluvium that has good hydrological characters, oxbows and water outlets, and the flood-free, dry surfaces suitable for grazing fields, animal husbandry and plant cultivation. This is in concordance with the results of pollen analysis.\n\nA low amount of Sarmatian and Gepids finds have been found in the area of the Rákóczifalva archaeological site, while the Late Sarmatian finds represent a very small amount. A similar amount of animal bones was found in Sarmatian and Gepids objects. 886 pieces of Sarmatian archaeozoological material originate from 88 objects, while 1012 pieces of Gepids’ bones turned up in only 11 objects. This is the reason why there is a big difference in the maximum number of individuals, as it was calculated on the basis of objects (Table 3).\n\nIn every Period came to light animal bones from ditches, pits and houses too.\n\nThe number of Sarmatian bones (886 pieces) is considered to be medium, and the number of identifiable and evaluable bones is 866 pieces. 97.1% of the findings were derived from domestic animals, with cattle being the most common, followed by sheep, goat, horse, pig and hen. A larger amount of dog and cat bones were also found. Results prove hunting and fishing. Similar bone ratios can be seen in the Hajdúnánás-Fürjhalom site as well: 98.13% of the finds originate from domestic animals, and the order of the species is the same as in case of the Rákóczifalva site.80 Compared to the more than 6,000 pieces of Hajdúnánás material, a very small amount was found in Lajosmizse, where 46.8% of the 158 pieces of bones was identified as cattle. Further order of species was sheep, horse, pig, hen,81 which was identical to the Rákóczifalva assemblage.\n\nThe same order could be revealed at the Endrőd 170 site,82 where 388 pieces of the 894 identifiable animal bones originated from cattle, representing 43% of the whole material. The number of sheep/goat bones was a little less than the number of cattle bones. Hen bones were not, but a goose bone has been found. Hunting was proved by two roe deer and one rabbit bone. Shell fragments have been found in Endrőd, but there was no evidence of fishing.83\n\nThe number of Late Sarmatian bone material is less than one-third of the Sarmatian and approximately is a quarter of the number of Gepids’ bones. 97.49% of the 244 animal bones were domestic animal remains. There is no justification for hunting, but a few fragments of fish bones and tortoise-shells indicate that besides domestic animal aquatic animals were also consumed. The number of Late Sarmatian domestic animals was as follows: catt le, horse, pig, sheep/goat and hen. The number of Late Sarmatian bone material is lower; however, the order of the species was reversed: the number of horse and pig bones preceded the number of sheep/goat. In the archaeological site of Dunavecse-Ugordáció I. site, in the level of the 4th–5th century (158 identifiable bones) the following ratio could be revealed: sheep/goat bone ratio was the highest (37%), followed by cattle (36.1%), pigs (15.2%), horses (7.6%), poultry (3.2%) and dogs (0.6%).84\n\nMost of the mid-size (979 pieces) animal bones of Gepids’ objects, similarly to the Sarmatian findings, can be interpreted as kitchen waste. It was hard to find whole bones that indicate that meat and bones were cut together during cooking. In spite of that, most of the bones could be identified. Only 28 bones were unidentifiable and found to be remnants of large or small mammals (Table 3). The Gepids’ finds contained the remains of domestic animals, wild birds that could not be identified on a species level, fish and aquatic animals. Findings indicating hunting did not turn up, even antler fragments that can be collected without killing the animal.\n\nThis is the only archaeological period in the Rákóczifalva site, where cattle bones are not the most common; although the amount of cattle bones are not much less than the number of ruminants (sheep and goat, 3% and 28 pieces). Interestingly pig bones are more frequent than horse bones. Among domestic animals, horses were rarely cut off – probably because of their high value. Poultry remains were also found, mostly hen bones and its ratio is roughly similar to horse bones. Some goose bones were found as well. In addition to the remains of meat-producing animals, bones of dogs and cats were also discovered. Probably dogs chewed more bones; there are signs of teeth on 16 findings including cattle, ruminants, pigs and even hens. It is not possible to estimate the number of bones that have been entirely eaten up. The cartilage bone ends of young poultry, especially hens, could be easily consumed by cats or even by humans that result in taphonomic losses. A significant number of fish bones refers to fishing and the extensive use of the alluvium.\n\nWe calculated for each species the minimal and maximal number of individuals (Table 3) for the Sarmatian, Late Sarmatian and Gepids period. In the first case, we calculated the number of bones for all of the same species of the site, and in case of the maximum number of individuals, we took the objects into one-one unit, calculated separately for each object and then summed up the results. The actual number of individuals of each species can be between the two values; the smallest number of individuals is undoubtedly below, and the maximum is overestimated.\n\nIn the vicinity of the settlement, grazing livestock of 21–35 individuals in the Sarmatian period, 14–47 individuals in the Late Sarmatian period and 23–53 individuals (sheep, goats, cattle, horses) in the Gepids era was required. These numbers do not seem to be significant, especially since we do not have information about the number of years the Gepids’ settlement was inhabited. Nevertheless, the continuous catering, grazing and winter feeding of a few dozen animals could be challenging. It should also be taken into account that not the entire Gepids settlement was excavated, meaning the number of individuals was definitely much higher.\n\nIn all three periods, the ratio of cattle is around 30%. It is highest in the Late Sarmatian period (37.91%) and lowest in the Gepids era (28.9%), so it is not around 50% that can be observed very often. In HajdúnánásFürjhalom-dűlő site, the Sarmatian cattle bone ratio is close to 50% (47.46%).85 Based on the number of bones, in case of a lower proportion of cattle, the domestic animal population is more balanced.\n\nThe 314 pieces of Sarmatian cattle bones represent 36.21% of the findings. It was the most common species; the smallest number of individuals was only 6, but the highest number of individuals per object was quite high, 64 individuals. This maximum number of individuals is certainly excessive since not all of the objects can be considered as independent households. This large amount is due to the fact that the objects are taken as a unit in this calculation method. Since 88 Sarmatian objects contained bones, most of the cattle bones as well, so the number of individuals is in concordance with that number.\n\nThe number of Late Sarmatian cattle bone is 91 pieces; the number of individuals is between 8 and 22. On the basis of the minimum number of individuals, the number of young animals is higher, one of them is only ½–¾ years old, it was slaughtered during winter. 3 more individuals were young, between 1 and 3 years old, one animal was adult (between 3 and 4 years old) and only one animal was mature. In contrast, the maximum number of individuals indicate a similar ratio of young and adult animals.\n\nThe 275 cattle bones represent 28.9% of the detectable findings. The bones come from at least 8 up to 22 animals; their age distribution is mixed. Out of the 8 individuals, one was juvenile, which is 1–3 years old in case of cattle. One was subadult that is 3–4 years old, 3 individuals were adults, over 4 years old. One individual was 6 –7 and one was 6–8 years old, already mature. One specimen died or was slaughtered as an old animal. In total more elder animals were slaughtered than young ones.\n\nIn case of the maximum number of individuals, the age distribution is more heterogenic. The number of young animals is 7, 3 individuals are already adults, 7 specimens are adults, 2 are matured and 1 is old and there were 2 cattle of undetermined age. Based on the age distribution of cattle, young and adult animals were slaughtered in each period. Young calves were slaughtered for their tastier flesh. Older animals served the man with their strength (bull) and milk (cow).\n\nThe metatarsus bones of 8 cattle could be used to calculate the withers and to determine the sex of the animal. The smallest cattle was a 109 cm tall cow; other cows were 111, 113 ad 114 cm tall. The tallest cow was 117 cm tall. One specimen was a bull, and its height was 122.8 cm (Fig. 19).86 In the Late Sarmatian period the withers of cattle is between 114 and 117 cm.\n\nThe 236 mm long bone derived from an approximately 126 cm tall cow.87 This cow is considered to be large compared to other samples from different periods. Bones suitable for withers calculation from Celtic, Sarmatian, Late Sarmatian, bones from the 4th–5th century, the late Migration Period and Arpadian Age occurred and were used for calculation; each animal was a cow. The height of the Celtic animal was small, around 107 cm. The Sarmatian cows were 111 and 117 cm tall, the 4th–5th century animals were 114–115 cm, from the late Migration Period they were 106, 114, 116 and 122 cm tall, from the Arpadian Age it was a small cow, only 108 cm tall.\n\nThere were 29 chewed Sarmatian cattle bones, body regions that are rich and poor in meat occurred as well. Only a femur (Fig. 20) were chewed except for one pelvic bone. A dozen carved bones occurred with a sign of cutting in the vertebra, rib, scapula and jawbone. Bones were carved for 7–15 cm pieces.\n\nRegarding Late Sarmatian bones, only 3 cattle bones were chewed; although the number of dog bones was lower as well compared to Sarmatian findings. All of the 3 bones were metatarsus and metacarpus bones.\n\nIn the Gepids material, the number of chewed bone is low as well. Only 7 pieces were found: 4 phalanges, one cochlea, one calcaneus and one tibia. The number of sliced cattle bones is two, one of them is a tibia the other is a 5 cm log horn fragment with parallel marks of cut and pole-axe (Fig. 21). Little is known about the use of horns, but Sarmatian sliced horns indicate the use of them. In Orosháza-Községporta-Szűcs-tanya archaeological site, more pieces of sliced horns occurred.88 The distribution of cattle bones regarding body region is even in all period of time, bones rich and poor in meat occur as well (Table 4). However, while during the Sarmatian period the limb region, during the Late Sarmatian and Gepids periods the bone volume of the head region dominated. The bone volume of the head region is increased by the fallen tooth remains. There were 27 pieces in the Sarmatian, 5 in the Late Sarmatian and 22 in the Gepids material. Apart from these, most of the bones derived from the body region during the Gepids period. These include high-quality meat bones, vertebra and ribs. Even today, sirloin, tenderloin, white and black roast meat of the hind legs are the most valuable and most expensive meat types. The volume of ribs is high in the Sarmatian and Gepids period because the 50 cm long rib bones were cut into approximately 15-20 cm pieces that are ideal for cooking and roasting.\n\nSheep and goat bones are very similar; it can only be distinguished by a few features of some of the bones. In the Sarmatian assemblage, 34 sheep and 4 goat bones were found, while 175 pieces could not be identified (sheep/ goat), their combined ratio was 24.56%. The number of individuals was between 10 and 37. The youngest sheep was slaughtered at the age of six months and another animal was slaughtered a bit later but still as a young specimen (about 9 months to 2.5 years old). One animal was nearly adult (2.5–3.5 years old) and one was adult. One of the goats had already undergone tooth replacement, but its teeth were barely rubbed and was still young (Figs 22–23). The other goat’s age could not be determined. Based on the bones identified as sheep/goat, the minimum number was 4 and each of them were young specimens. The maximum individual number in case of sheep was 11, where two adults, one nearly adult and three young specimens could be identified. The age of five individuals could not be determined. In the case of sheep/goats, the number of young specimens was 10, while the number of adult and older animals was only 3. However, the age of 11 animals could not be determined.\n\nThe Late Sarmatian material contains 26 small ruminant bones, two of them derive certainly from sheep. Bones referring to goats did not turn up. Because of the lower number of bones, the number of individuals is much smaller, ranging from 2 to 10, of which only one specimen was young, all other were adult animals. Therefore, small ruminants were not raised mainly because of their meat, and they could use their milk, or even their wool in the case of sheep.\n\nIn the Gepids material, small ruminants include sheep and goats as well. Because of the high degree of\n\nsimilarity between the bones of the two species, it is difficult to distinguish them. 10 bones of the 303 small ruminant bones were identified as sheep, one as a goat, and 292 as either of these species. In general, sheep are more common in every period of time and goats are less frequent. Among the sheep/goat findings, several bones were chewed by dogs, most of them come from meat-rich regions of the body.\n\nThe age distribution of the individuals is mixed. Two sheep and one goat were adult specimen; the age distribution of the sheep/goat individuals was mixed. Based on the smallest number of individuals, one specimen was between 1 and 2 years old, and one was between 1 and 1.5 years old. Three animals were young (less than 2.5 years), one was nearly adult (2.5–3.5 years old) and three were adults.\n\nBased on the highest number of individuals, the age of two sheep and one goat was adult. In the case of the 19 sheep/goats specimens there were young and adult animals in half to half ratio: nine specimens were juvenile, one of them was between 1–2 years old, one of them was younger than 1.5 years old and one between 1–2 years old. The age of the other six young animals could not be determined, but they were surely younger than 2.5 years old. Three animals were subadult, i.e. nearly adult and six were adult specimens. The age of one animal could not be determined. Surprisingly the remains of very young, i.e. younger than one-year-old animal did not occur.\n\nThe age distribution of the animals was mixed in each period of times: some of them was slaughtered at a young age, while others as an adult. The slaughtering of young animals clearly indicates the utilization of meat, while slaughtering the older ones’ point to milk and wool utilization.\n\nIn the Sarmatian period in the case of small ruminants, most of the findings derived from the body region, mainly vertebra and ribs. Even in the Gepids period, the number of ribs were higher than other bones (Table 4).\n\nLong bones derived only from Sarmatian objects from which the height of the withers of the sheep can be estimated. One animal was 58–59 cm and one was slightly larger than 61 cm.89\n\n71 horse bones turned up that is 8.19% of the definable Sarmatian bones. The number of individuals is between 5 and 34. Late Sarmatian objects also contained 71 horse bones, but their ratio is almost 30% in this period of time. The number of individuals is between 4 and 15. While in the Sarmatian period horse bones are the third most common bones, in the Late Sarmatian period it is the second common bone. However, in the Gepids period, all domestic meat-producing mammals were more common than horses (Table 3).\n\nThe youngest of the 5 Sarmatian horses was less than 1-year-old. Even the 2.5–3 years old animal can be considered as young as well. Two animals were mature; one of them was approximately 5 years old. The oldest animal is an approximately 15 years old mare. It was rare to keep horses until such an old age.\n\nBased on the maximum number of individuals, one of the 34 animals was younger than 1-year-old, 2 animals were young (1–2.5 years old), 15 adults and 1 old. However, the number of non-determinable animals was large: 15 specimens.\n\nIn the lower number of Late Sarmatian bone assemblage, one of the 4 horses was almost adult, one was 5–6 years old and 2 were older. The maximum number of individuals is 15, where 2 specimens were juveniles, one subadult, 2 adults, one was 5–6 years old and 3 specimens were older animals. The age of six individuals could not be determined, but they certainly were not young specimens.\n\nThe consumption of horse meat is also indicated by cut bones: signs of cuts are seen at the cranial end of the second cervical from the Sarmatian period. Traces of cuts in the ischium of a pelvis also indicate meat consumption. On the front of a Late Sarmatian cochlea (snail shell-shaped dense bone), there are small traces of cuts. Pieces of cut Gepids horse bones have not been found, but chewed remains had. Tooth marks at the lower end of a phalanx were found suggesting that dogs living in the village had access to kitchen waste bones.\n\nThe withers of horses could only be estimated on the basis of intact long horse bones from Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian objects. Intact long bones from Gepids objects did not turn up. Horses of various sizes lived during both the Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian periods. Smaller horses were around 130 cm high, medium-sized horses were between 138 and 140 cm and the highest horses were 144–145 cm high.90 In the Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian period, horse bones are more frequent than pig bones. However, among meat-producing animals, ruminants are followed by pigs in the Gepids material. The number of Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian pig bones almost corresponds with each other; they are 44 and 43 pieces. There is a big difference in the proportion of bones, as while the 44 Sarmatian pig bones represent 5.07%, pig bones represent 18% (Table 3) in the lower total bone number of the Late Sarmatian period.\n\nThe number of Sarmatian pig individuals is between 5 and 24. Based on the minimum number of individuals, the age of the animals are as follows: The youngest specimen is ¾–1-year-old. Two specimens are 1 ¼ years old, one is 2–3 years old and one is a subadult male animal. Much of the 24 specimens were young: 13 individuals; three were subadult, one of them was male. The age of eight specimens could not be determined.\n\nOnly young specimens were found among Late Sarmatian individuals. According to the minimal number of individuals the youngest animal was slaughtered before its ½ year old age, one animal at the age of 9 months old and one at the age of one. The two oldest pig could be only 2 years old. At this age, a pig is mature, but not yet fullgrown. The maximum number of individuals is supplemented by two specimens younger than 1 year-old and 2 specimens of undetermined age.\n\nThe withers of 1–1 individuals could be determined in both of the periods, the Sarmatian pig was a 70 cm, the Late Sarmatian was a 72 cm91 short animal.\n\n94 pig bones account for 9.9% of the findings. Regarding the number of individuals, the lowest number is 8, the highest is 18. Compared to the amount of bones, this number is very significant, as it approximates the number of small ruminants and cattle. The age distribution of individuals is mixed. In the case of pigs, it is common that very young animal remains appear in the findings, as they are short-lived, fast-growing animals that have more piglets at the same time, making it easy to replace slaughtered animals. Comparing to other domestic species pigs are meat producing animals, there are no other forms of utilization.\n\nBased on the smallest number of individuals, one pig was only ½ years old and one was ¾ years old when it was slaughtered. A one-year-old animal can be considered as young as well. There were a few specimens that could not be precisely defined: one 2–3 years old, a younger than 2.5 years old, one 2.5–3.5 years old and 2 adult pig, including a male animal.\n\nThe number of individuals per object (the maximum number of individuals) was as follows. It added 10 animals to the above mentioned: the number of juvenile pigs (less than 2.5 years old) was not one, but 4, 2 individuals were 2.5–3.5 years old and 3 individuals (instead of 2) were adult. The age of 5 animals could not be defined. The majority of pig bones are derived from the head region in all of the periods (Table 4). This means that the meat of the head and face were popular.\n\nOn the basis of charcoal analysis, hardwood gallery forest existed in the vicinity of the settlement, mostly with oak trees. Oak acorn served as the basis for pig feeding. In October and November pigs ate fallen acorns up in the forest, while in the case of early snowfall they ate the rest of the acorns during spring.\n\nBoth Sarmatian and Late Sarmatian findings contain 1–1 hen bone, a raven toe and a humerus. Both bones derived from undamaged, mature specimens. Usually, poultry bones are very rare or are missing in Sarmatian findings. Only a few bird bones turned up in Dunavecse-Ugordáció I. site, in both the level of the 2nd and 3rd century and the Late Sarmatian (4th–5th century) level. Two pieces of bird bones, probably domesticated poultry bones were found in the level of the 2nd and 3rd century.92 The same could be observed in the Orosháza-Községporta-Szűcs-tanya site, where only 2 of the 375 pieces of bones proved to be hen bones. Goose bones are completely missing.93 Although, the number of chicken bones (38 pieces) was behind horse bones (43 pieces), using the number of individuals’ calculations (4/11) it preceded the number of horse individuals (3/9). The volume of meat obtained by the slaughtering of animals is not even approaching to that of horses, not either small ruminants and pigs. The minimum number of individuals was at least 4, maximum 11. Based on the minimum number of individuals, 2 specimens were not yet mature and there were 2 adults, including one male and one female. Based on the number of individuals per object (maximum number), 11 specimens could be identified, of which 4 were non-mature, 7 were adults including 3 females and one male.\n\nGoose bones are known from every time period of the site. There are two goose bones in the Sarmatian and one in the Late Sarmatian material. Most of the bones were found in the Gepids level, where 8 related bones of a goose-like bird turned up from the object 194 (a building). The number of individuals was two in the Sarmatian period, and one-one in the Late Sarmatian and Gepids era. Each bird was an adult specimen.\n\nThe 166 pieces of Sarmatian dog bones derive from a surprising number of individuals even in case of the minimum number of individuals. Out of the 11 specimens, only two was young, one of them was younger than 1 year old, the other was young, almost adult. The rest of the animals are adult specimens; five of them died at an older age. There is a vertical mark of cut on the left jawbone, on the outside of the bone between the P3-4 (Fig. 24) of an adult but not old dog. According to this finding the slaughter of dogs and the consumption of their meat do not seem to have ended in the Celtic Period. Earlier, Hungarian archaeozoology supposed that people stopped eating dog meat after the Bronze Age.94 However, recent research has shown that neither Scythians nor Celts rejected dog meat. This Sarmatian jawbone proves that the consumption of dog meat occurred during the Roman Age as well.\n\nIn this site, the number of dog bones was less than that of a single complete animal, yet the number of individuals is quite high. Most bones were parts of the head, including the skull, chin and jawbone. One-one skulls without limbs turned up in four objects and only one-one jawbone was found in two objects. For example, in object 339 only the dorsal-lumbar part of the spine was exposed.\n\nDogs can be divided into three height groups: the smallest are 40–41 cm in height, such as puli dogs nowadays. Medium-sized ones are 48–51 cm and the largest are 62–65 cm, for example, shepherd dogs (such as today’s German shepherd) or hunting dogs (such as the male Hungarian vizsla).\n\nA bone coalition can be seen on the back leg of an older dog due to an inflammation process of the metacarpus and metatarsus on the foreleg and back leg of the animal (Object 255, Fig. 25).\n\nDog bones from the Late Sarmatian period have also been found, however only two pieces: a jawbone and a femur fragment of an adult animal or animals.\n\nIn the Gepids period, the 108 dog bones refer to five animals. The minimum and maximum number of individuals corresponds with each other. One of the dogs is new-born, one of them is a puppy, one of them is young and two of them are adults.\n\nThe withers can be calculated on the basis of the long bones of one of the adult dogs. The very short, dense bones indicate a 24–29 cm high, slightly bandy-legged dog.95 Such small dogs are very rare during this period of time; they can be observed only in the Roman Age. This animal can be classified as a small dog, weighing between 4.5 and 11.5 kg. Dachshunds have such parameters today.\n\n43 pieces of the Sarmatian bones were chewed by dogs, that is 5% of the bones. 12 bones of the Late Sarmatian period are chewed that is also 5% of the bones. In the Gepids assemblage, 16 bones are chewed (1.5%) including cattle, small ruminants, pig and hen bones. It is not even possible to estimate the number of bones that have been completely consumed. The cartilage bone ends of young poultry, especially hens, could be easily consumed by cats or even by humans that increase taphonomic loss.\n\nIn the Sarmatian period, 32 cat bones turned up in three objects. None of the animals was adult. Three bones of one cat turned up, a humerus and two tibias. Another cat’s back limb (pelvic, femur ad tibia) and forelegs, including a humerus, a cubit bone and a rib fragment subsisted. The remain of the third cat is the most complete: 15 bones were found including the fragments of the skull and chin bone, two lumbar vertebrae bones, its scapula, left humerus, radial bone and cubit bone (forelegs), its left pelvic, left and right femur and tibia (back legs) and its right fibula. The role of cats could be to keep rodents away in the vicinity of houses and crop storage pits.\n\nOnly one red deer bone was found, from a Sarmatian pit, a 14 cm long metacarpus bone of an adult animal. This leg bone does not contain any substantive meat. Its occurrence suggests that the animal was completely transported to the settlement, and the valueless parts of the animal were not left behind in the hunting site. Deer or other big games were not found in the Late Sarmatian and Gepids finds.\n\nFish bones can be found in all of the examined time periods, which proves fishing and the extensive use of the alluvial plain. Several species were found in the Tisza bed, in the backwaters and in the floodwaters: the larger catfish (Fig. 26), the smaller pike (Fig. 27) and other smaller fishes. There are 11 fish bones in the Sarmatian part of the manual collection, only 2 in the Late Sarmatian and 44 in the Gepids fish bone assemblage. The sifting of the filling of objects would have multiplied the quantity of fish bones.\n\nThe catfish is common in rivers and lakes while the pike favor lakes and oxbows with fresh water income and rich vegetation. The catfish is a large fish; its meat is delicious, fat-rich, and bone-free. The advantage of the pike is that it does not pit in winter, so it can be fished from a leak; its meat is white, clean, tasty, but has bones. The quality of the meat is influenced by the purity of the water, and the taste of small fishes ate up by the pike.\n\nThe minimum individual number of fish bones is three in the Sarmatian period, one in the Late Sarmatian and 4 in the Gepids era. The maximum individual number chronologically is six, two and nine. The pectoral spine of a catfish found in a Sarmatian object derives from a much smaller fish than those bones that derive from Copper Age and Avar objects of the site.\n\nThe smaller amount of fish bones and mammal bones are very important because they prove that meat consumption of a community was much more colourful and was not limited to domestic animals.\n\nThe shell remains of the European pond turtle were also discovered in the Sarmatian, Late Sarmatian and Gepids period. Their number is low, only 1–2 fragments turned up. This turtle species – that is the only one native turtle species in the Carpathian Basin – favour shallow, muddy stagnant water that could be found in the vicinity of Rákóczifalva as well.
