She has significant industrial connections and is co-founder of the Luzitin spin-off company. She did a lot to help the UP Faculty of Sciences Institute of Chemistry to move forward. The most important indicators of her cooperation with the institute are the mutual exchange of researchers, students and doctoral students, as well as the many joint scientific publications\" – highlighted Dr. László Kollár, professor at the Institute of Chemistry of the UP Faculty of Sciences, describing the professional work and public activities of professor Maria Miguéns Pereira. He also proudly added that one of their former joint doctoral students was also present at the ceremony, which is the only reason why she travelled to Pécs.\n\n\"Thank you for the honour\" – emphasized Maria Miguéns Pereira, recalling the beginning of the relationship with the University of Pécs: \"in 1999, at the end of my PhD studies, I heard professor Kollár give a lecture in Tarragona, and since then it has become a fruitful relationship.\n\nI think the relationship between the two institutions is a good example of how the field of science is not necessarily synonymous with academic competition.\"\n\nThe new honorary doctor of the University of Pécs also mentioned Katalin Karikó's success this year, having met the recent Nobel Prize winner in Paris last year – congratulating the entire Hungarian scientific community on the recognition. She also pointed out that just as Pécs is among the first universities with its foundation in 1367, the University of Coimbra is also among the first universities in the world, as it was founded in 1290 – this is also a link between the two institutions.\n\n\"There have always been challenges, but for my part I am optimistic and confident that the university spirit will prevail,\" she said. Finally, she thanked her family and close friends and concluded her speech with a quote from Pasteur: \"Science knows no borders, because knowledge belongs to humanity itself, it shines like a torch on the world.\"\n\nMore information\n\nRon Cordova\n\nProf. Ron Cordova is Doctor et Professor Honoris Causa of Faculty of Law since 9 November 2023.\n\n\"Ron Cordova first arrived at the Faculty of Law in Pécs in the spring of 2010 as a guest lecturer after lecturing at every other law faculty in the country. It was then that he decided to return to Pécs every semester from that time on. He justified his decision with two reasons:\n\nthis city is the most beautiful city he has visited in Hungary, and the students are the most talented here.\n\nSince then, he has really come every semester and teaches classes with 100% attendance, his students rate him highly. He was active in the review of U.S. criminal law in California from 1976–78, and has since worked as an attorney in Orange County, with numerous publications on U.S. criminal practice. He speaks German, Spanish, Italian, Swedish and a little Hungarian excellently, because his mother was forced to emigrate to America from Cluj-Napoca in 1940\" – István László Gál, professor at the Faculty of Law described professor Ron Cordova's professional work and public activities.\n\n\"I am very grateful for this recognition!\" – said professor Ron Cordova in his speech and continued: \"my Hungarian mentor, István László Gál, let me know 30 minutes ago that I needed to give a speech – thank you for the challenge. Indeed, since 2010 I have come to teach courses at the Faculty of Law in Pécs twice a year, with the exception of the pandemic that swept the world. I hope I can continue this practice so that I can come to Pécs, this beautiful city, to learn and teach, and to share my experiences. I confess that for my part\n\nI almost feel part of the teaching community here, which is why this is an important moment in my life. To see my students develop, and even to witness that some of them have become faculty members and researchers in the meantime - words cannot express it - as well as honorary doctorate recognition,\"\n\n- accentuated Ron Cordova.\n\nMore information\n\n​\n\nMetin Akay\n\nThe University of Pécs conferred the degree of honorary doctor upon the internationally renowned professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Houston, dr.

According to Maastricht rules, countries entering Euroland had to have a public debt below 60% of their GDP. However, countries with debt burdens bigger than that – countries with „original sins” – also had to be admitted. Thus, for the sake of security, a condition limiting the annual public sector deficit to 3 % of the GDP was also set. Then, fiscal rules were also extended and „perfected” for countries already members of Euroland. But the violators have never been punished. And still, the rules seriously impair member countries’fiscal autonomy.\n\nEconomists – Charles Wyplosz some other colleagues – have recently designed a concept according to which the seigniorage revenue of the ECB could become the source of servicing an important fraction of outstanding public debts. This would also imply a politically acceptable way to reduce high debts to a reasonable level, i. e., to abolish the „original sin” of indebted countries. After it, any member government would only be threatened by bankruptcy if it behaved in an extremely irresponsible way. My question is whether then the system of fiscal rules should still be maintained.\n\nDate of inauguration: 14 March 2018\n\n2017\n\nDonald Tusk\n\nDonald Tusk is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 8 December 2017.\n\nDonald Tusk was born in 1957 in Gdańsk, Poland.

During the years 1993/95 I worked at the Berlin-based Institute on the history and culture of East Central Europe (forerunner of the GWZO in Leipzig) on a project on Early modern estates in East-Central Europe (directed by Winfried Eberhard). Since 1996 I am member of research staff of the Marburg Herder Institute for Historical Research on East Central Europe. For more than ten years I headed a work group providing a online-database on the history of East Central Europe in ccoperation with associated institutes; above that I do university teaching continously first in Hamburg and since 1998 in Gießen. Besides this it was possible on the one hand to go on working on comparative studies on the history of historiography and on the other hand to publish studies on special topics on the history of the single regions and countries concerning the medieval and early modern history of East Central Europe (in detail on Pomorania, Livonia, Upper Lusatia, Silesia, Bohemia, Polan and Hungary). A three years research stay at the German Historical Institute in Warsaw was dedicated to issues of the foreign relations of Piast Poland.\n\nAbove that, in Berlin, Warsaw and Marburg, I organized conferences to kick off new research and to stimulate exchange between colleagues in the countries of East Central Europe. These conferences featured different topics as the politics of the Estates, medieval historiography, the political and cultural networks of Piast Poland, late medieval foreign politics, medieval interregna, influences of the Reformation in East Central Europe or the crusading movement in late medieval Europe.\n\nPredrag Sikirić\n\nPredrag Sikirić is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 16 November 2017.\n\nDepartment of Pharmacology, Medical University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPredrag Sikiric MD,PhD is professor at the Department of Pharmacology, Medical University of Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nHe and his team discovered an peptide in the human gastric juce, which prevents the development of gastric mucosal damage (without any inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion). This molecule was isolated and the sequence of amino acids was identifield. This molecule acts in very small doses, and it has no toxic behaviour. Later, he and his coworkers proved the mucosal protecting effects on the other parts of gastrointestinal tract in animal experiments and human studies. Now this molecule exists in different human clinical pharmacological phase examinations in patients with ulcerative colitis and sclerosis multiplex. This active peptide compound was named as “Body Protection Compound, BPC”.\n\nOur scientific collaboration started from 1989, and it’s existing up to now. We together organized international symposia of International Conferences on Ulcer Researh and of International Union of Pharmacology, Gastrointestinal Section (IUPHAR GI SECTION) in Hungary (Budapest, Pécs) and Croatia (Zagreb, Dubrovnik, Split). We together established the international journal (Pergamon Press Publishers) “Experimental and Clinical Gastroenteroloy” (1990).\n\nWe have principle roles in the establishing of possibilities for Hungary and Croatia to participate in the World scientific collaboration in our fields , namely ulcer research.\n\nProfessor Sikiric and his studies internationally well know and accepted.\n\nStephen M.

Buzsaki was born in Hungary, grew up in Pécs, where received his M.D. in 1974 from the University of Pécs, then earned his Ph.D. in Neuroscience in 1984 from the Academy of Sciences in Budapest. He is among the top 1% most-cited neuroscientists, member of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Academiae Europaeae and an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He sits on the editorial boards of several leading neuroscience journals, including Science and Neuron, received honoris causa from Université Aix-Marseille, France, University of Kaposvar, Hungary and University of Pecs, Hungary. He is a co-recipient of the 2011 Brain Prize (with Peter Somogyi and Tamas Freund). Author of a popular neuroscience book: G. Buzsáki, Rhythms of the Brain, Oxford University Press, 2006.\n\nResearch Interest\n\nBuzsáki’s primary interests is “neural syntax”, i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions.. He identified the cellular-synaptic basis of hippocampal theta, gamma oscillations and sharp waves with associated fast oscillations, their relationship to each other and to behavior and sleep. He was the first to demonstrate the role of GABAergic interneurons in network oscillations. Buzsaki’s recognition of the importance hierarchical organization of brain rhythms of different frequencies and their cross-frequency coupling has opened up opportunities for the dissection of cognitive mechanisms in health and disease.\n\nHis most influential work, the two-stage model of memory trace consolidation, demonstrates how the neocortex-mediated information during learning transiently modifies hippocampal networks, followed by reactivation and consolidation of these memory traces during sharp wave-ripple patterns of sleep. Buzsaki’s demonstration that in the absence of changing environmental signals, cortical circuits continuously generate self-organized cell assembly sequences is a breakthrough for the neuronal assembly basis of cognitive functions. His recent experiments demonstrated how skewed distribution of firing rates supports robustness, sensitivity, plasticity and stability in neuronal networks.\n\nTo achieve these goals he has pioneered numerous technical innovations, including large-scale recording methods using silicon chips and the NeuroGrid, an organic, comformable electrode system used in both animal and patients.\n\nÁrpád Kovács\n\nDr. Árpád Kovács is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 16 March 2017.\n\nFerenc Schipp\n\nDr. Ferenc Schipp is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 16 March 2017.\n\n2016\n\nCsaba Makó\n\nCsaba Makó is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 9 November 2016.\n\nResearch Chair (MTA TK SZI)\n\nDepartment: Research Department for Social Integration and Social\n\nPolicy Academic Title: Doctor of HAS, DSc.\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nDSc, Scientific Adviser\n\nAcademic training\n\nD.Sc., (1983)\n\nPh.D., sociology, (1973)\n\nEconomist, Marx Károly University of Economy (1967)\n\nWork experience\n\nScientific advisor, Institute of Sociology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1990-)\n\nHead of Research Group, Research Group for Sociology of Organisation and Work, Institute of Sociology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2001-)\n\nDirector, Institute of Management Education, Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, St. Stephen University (1998-2001)\n\nDirector, Institute of Sociology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1988-1990)\n\nProfessor, Budapest University of Economic Sciences (1985-)\n\nTeaching experience\n\nUniversity of Debrecen, Faculty of Economics (2006-2007)\n\nBudapest Corvinus University (1985-2008)\n\nUniversity of Szent István, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences (1998-2008)\n\nUniversity of Pécs, Faculty of Economics (2006-2007)\n\nFellowship\n\nEuropean Union (PHARE) Fellowship, University of Glasgow Business School, 5 months (1996)\n\nJapan Foundation Exchange Fellowship, Institute for Social Sciences, Chuo University, Tokyo, 3 months (1992)\n\nEisenhower Foundation Exchange Fellowship, USA, 3 months (1987)\n\nRecent projects\n\nCharacteristics of the Knowledge and Manpower Use: Special Focus on the Work Organisations\n\nMeasuring the Dynamics of Organisation and Work (MEADOW)\n\nWork Organisation and Restructuring in the Knowledge Society (WORKS)\n\nNew Social Risks in the European Knowledge Society and Higher Education (NESOR)\n\nFlexible Adaptability of Enterprises and Employees - Research Experiences and Best Practices\n\nOn the Factors Hindering or Facilitating Telework Diffusion in International Perspective\n\nScientific activity\n\nMember, IXth Division of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Doctor Committe of the International Studies (2007)\n\nMember, Economic Qualification Committee (EQC) (2002)\n\nMember, IXth Department of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2000)\n\nMember, Scottish Centre for Employment Resarch (2007)\n\nPresident, Scientific Committee of Management and Organization, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1999-2005)\n\nMember, Committee of Labour Sciences , Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1985-2007)\n\nEkkehard Nuissl\n\nProf. Dr. Ekkehard Nuissl is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 9 November 2016.\n\nCurriculum vitae:\n\nBorn in 1946, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

Competences and their Acknowledgement.\n\nA short part of the Inauguration Speech of Prof. Dr. Ekkehard Nuissl von Rein before taking Honorosis Causa title from the Rector of the University of Pécs\n\nIt is not at all surprising that most influential international organisations, like the UNESCO, OECD and the EU, signal nowadays underline the importance of quality education to be developed. Not only rising the number of learners, but also the performance of learners may reflect the competitiveness of a country or a region. I presume the performance of adult learners strongly depend on available high quality adult learning professionals, we today would call adult educators.\n\nCompetencies of adult educators depend, up to a certain extent, of their higher education and it is more than important today to develop, innovate and research how adult educators are educated and trained within higher education institutions. One element of our scrutiny is to analyse and compare curricula of BA and MA in Adult Education in order to be able to point out where and what to change, improve or modify referring to content, structure, methodologies, assessment, etc.\n\nIn the last ten years, I have dealt with the comparative studies of curricula of MA programmes in Adult Education across Europe so as to develop a European Masters in Adult Education. Three years ago, the University joined a distinguished project called European Studies and Research in Adult Learning and Education (ESRALE) together with nine other universities and two professional bodies (DIE and VPL) to jointly develop a programme to educate and train “Competent Adult Educators”. In my inauguration speech, I am going to describe some findings of ESRALE, the project I have led, around competences and their acknowledgement, both in professional and in academic contexts.\n\nMarkus W. Brüchler\n\nProfessor Markus W. Büchler is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 9 November 2016.\n\nBiography:\n\nUniversity of Heidelberg, Germany\n\nProfessor Markus W. Büchler is the executive director and professor of surgery at the department of surgery at Heidelberg University. After studying medicine in Heidelberg and Berlin he started his surgical training at the University of Ulm where he became deputy clinical director in 1987. In 1993 he became professor of surgery and clinical director at the University of Bern, Switzerland. In 2001 he returned to Germany to start leading the surgical department in Heidelberg. Today he is also head of the surgical departments at the Salem hospital in Heidelberg and at the general hospitals of Sinsheim, Eberbach, and Heppenheim. He is an internationally respected expert in the field of surgery, especially in the field of pancreatic surgery. More than 2300 authored scientific manuscripts published by him focused on the molecular basis of GI cancer and pancreatic diseases as well as clinical surgical problems. Among others he has been president of the German Surgical Society, the European Pancreas Club, and the International Hepato-Pancreato-Bilary Association. He is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and he is an honorary member of the American Surgical Association and the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of England and Scotland among other societies. He has received multiple scientific awards and is a member of the editorial boards of many well-known scientific journals.\n\nA short part of the Inauguration Speech of Prof. Markus W. Büchler\n\nRector of the University of Pécs, Prof. Dr. Joseph Bódis,\n\nHonorable members of the Senate of the University of Pécs,\n\nDear colleagues at the University of Pécs,\n\nIt is a great privilege and honor for me to receive this Honorary Doctorate from one of the eldest universities in Europe and from biggest university in Hungary.\n\nAt the beginning of this year I was told that I would be recipient of this degree. In this moment it became clear to me how intense my connection with the University of Pécs has become over the years. Already during my surgical training in Ulm in the 1980s I got to know my dear friend and your colleague Dezső Kelemen. This friendship resulted in my ongoing personal and professional exchange with him and with the University of Pécs. Since 2001 I have the great pleasure to accompany and to direct this exchange as Professor of surgery and chairman at the University Hospital of Heidelberg, one of the biggest and most renowned in Germany.\n\nThough many things around us have changed over the years we succeded to establish a persistent connection that based on clinical and scientifical collaboration, regular personal exchange, and common events. Even in times of modern communication you still have to face challenges concerning language and bureaucracy that could interfere into exchange. It has therefore always been impressive to me how easy, close and fruitful exchange between Pécs and Heidelberg Universities has been. Together we contributed to progress in research, clinical medicine and especially in surgery.\n\nRonald L. Hayes\n\nRonald L. Hayes is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 9 November 2016.\n\nFounder and Chief Science Officer, Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nDirector, Banyan Laboratories\n\nBanyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nRonald L. Hayes, Ph.D. is co-founder and Chief Science Officer of Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. He is also Director of Banyan Laboratories. Previously he was Director of the University of Florida’s Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Studies which focused on laboratory studies of basic mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and development of novel therapies to treat deficits following brain injury including disturbances in memory and attention. Dr. Hayes has more than 35 years of experience studying brain injury. He is past President of The National Neurotrauma Society, on the Scientific Advisory Boards of International Brain Injury Association and the International Neurotrauma Society. Dr. Hayes has published more than 300 peer reviewed papers and more than 50 book chapters. Dr. Hayes has also co-edited three books on traumatic brain injury. He has been funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than 30 years and is currently funded by both the NIH and the Department of Defense.\n\nSerafino Gladiali\n\nProf. Serafino Gladiali is honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 9 November 2016.\n\nA short part of the Inauguration Speech of Prof. Serafino Gladiali:\n\nMagnificent Rector, Academic Authorities, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nfirst let me thank the University of Pécs for delivering me this “Honoris Causa Doctorate’. I feel extremely honoured in receiving this award that comes to me as one of the most significant achievements of my research activity.\n\nAt the same time this celebration looks to me the best way to illustrate the long standing joint collaboration in the field of catalysis between the Universities of Pecs and Sassari. This collaboration, originally established over twenty years ago when Prof. Kollár was still working at the University of Veszprém, moved jointly with him when he took up the chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Pécs in 1997.\n\nIn the course of the years the joint projects arising from this collaboration allowed a number of young coworkers to move to Sassari from Pécs and vice-versa for research stages that have contributed to improve their scientific expertise and have positively impacted on their doctoral and post-doctoral record.\n\nThanks to various funds we had the possibility of several visits. The scientific collaboration still exists and active with one of my former colleagues. I look back with much pleasure to the scientific discussions I had with the colleagues at the University. For this reason, I appreciate very much the opportunity given by this ceremony that brings me once more to Pecs to renovate the good feelings of some time ago.\n\nFinally, let me add one personal notation. Today in the audience there is a large delegation of my family including my wife, my children and some grandchildren. I guess that you may agree with me that it is a very rare case in the life to have children/grandchildren attending the graduation ceremony of their father/grandfather. I am the lucky man that has the possibility to enjoy this “back to the future” experience. This makes me extremely proud and happy. I like to thank you again for your decision to handing over me this award today.\n\nChen Qingchang\n\nChen Qingchang honorary doctor of the University of Pécs since 10 March 2016.\n\nResearch activity:\n\n2014 - Low-carbon Environmental Regeneration Based on Multi-objective Algorithm supported by Shanghai Soft Science Research)\n\n2009-2012 - Historical Resource Redevelopment Research of Yangpu District Shanghai（Yangpu tartomány által finanszírozva)\n\n2008-2011 - General Investigation of Shanghai Lilong（Shanghai Város által támogatva )\n\n2008-2010- Study on Sustainable Utilization of Historic Building and Comprehensive Transformation Technology（supported by Key Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program)\n\n2007 - On the Adaptability Mode of Preservation and Regeneration of Chinese Vernacular Settlement（a Kínai Nemzeti Természettudományi Alap által támogatva）\n\n2007 - On the Adaptability Mode of Preservation and Regeneration of Chinese Vernacular Settlement（a Kínai Nemzeti Természettudományi Alap által támogatva）\n\nAwards:\n\n2012 Oktatói Kiválóság Pályázat - Második Díj, SIT\n\n2011 „Kiváló PhD tézis” díj\n\n2008 Extra Prize of Planning awarded by Shanghai Xian-Dai Architectural Design(Group) Co.Ltd.\n\n2008 Második díj a “Streetscape in a New World” Nemzetközi építészeti tervpályázaton „Urban Streetscape Design” (Első díjat kapott Shanghai várostól)\n\n2000 Memorial Award of China Pavilion Competition, World Expo\n\nImportant publications:\n\n2014 Identity transformation of energy construction——Irish \" Big Island Power Station \" International Design Competition (Industrial Architecture\n\n2013 On regeneration of Shanghai Lilong among the various interest groups（Art & Desig）\n\n2012 Study on the planning of mixed-functional residence of city outskirts district (Shanxi Architecture）\n\n2011 On the regeneration mode of Tianzifang（Chinese and Overseas Architecture）\n\n2009 The Outset of Information Scenes in Urban Street (The Proceedings of Graduate Students of Tongji University)\n\n2009 The best communication system of urban block in the Information Age（Architectural Journal）\n\n2008 Urban Pixel（”Streetscape in a New World” International Competition of Urban Streetscape Design)\n\n2008 Ecological Concept in Ancient China (Huazhong Architecture)\n\n2008 Digital pixel virtual reconstruction of urban street space (The 6th National Annual Meeting of Postgraduate in Architecture& Urban Planning)\n\n2007 Acoustic Ecology（Architectural Journal）\n\nBook:\n\n2013 On Regeneration of Shanghai’s Lilong Based On Symbiosis Theory\n\nPositions, Memberships:\n\nDeputy Director of Bureau of Urban Planning and Land Management of Xuhui District Shanghai Deputy Dean of Department of Architecture, SIT\n\nAffiliate Member of RIBA\n\nMember of CAS\n\nMember of WRSACO\n\nPlácido Domingo\n\nLaudatio of Tamás Lakner, dean of the Music and Visual Arts:\n\n\"As the dean of the Faculty of Music and Visual Arts, and particularly as a musician, it is a great honor for me, to have the chance to greet in person, and to write an appreciation of one of the most remarkable musicians of our times.\n\nAccording to the Doctoral Regulations of the University of Pécs, my task is to prove the eligibility of our Candidate for the title “Doctor Honoris Causa”.\n\nShould I go into details, when introducing the life-work of Plácido Domingo, who conquered the world over fifty years ago, and has kept us in fever of excitement with his voice, fierce passion, love of music and men, incomparable personality and artistic qualities, ever since?\n\nObviously, we can illustrate his achievements with numbers as follows – the hundred and fifty roles he has sung and acted, in thirty-seven-hundred opera-performances. Or we may mention the five-hundred concerts where he held the conductor’s baton, or, why not, the over one hundred recordings… But I’m convinced, that all these together, still do not truly mirror the input Maestro Domingo has made on the music of our times. He is often called, justly, the “King of Opera” also in the world-press.\n\nEvery evening he slips into somebody else’s skin, and still remains himself. His vast musical talent is shown, from this point of view as well.\n\nMaestro Domingo gives us a never-fading example on philanthropy, charity and humanitarian aid, too. It is enough to mention just a few occasions: the nineteen-eighty-five earthquake in Mexico or the reconstructing and rebuilding works after the twenty-o-six Katrina hurricane in New Orleans. His motto was and still is: “Music is the voice of hope”.\n\nBesides building his own career, Maestro Domingo pays a special attention to the promotion of young and talented artists, passing his superb knowledge, and great experiences to the upcoming generations. Actually, this is the main task of all universities! He has founded the international singing competition “Operalia”, where our former and present students regularly take part.\n\nAn integral and important part of our educational mission is to present a genuine example, showing up the oeuvre of the best artists. The University of Pécs, conferring an honorary degree on Maestro Plácido Domingo, will be enriched with an example of exceptional, multifaceted artist of the highest standard, and excellence.\n\nThe one, who can pass the splendid experience of working together with Maestro Domingo to our students directly, is already with us: Tokody Ilona, our honorary professor, decorated with Kossuth Award – as they have performed together in the most renowned opera houses of the world, several times, in unforgettable opera-projects.\n\nBesides Professor Tokody, Maestro Domingo has stepped on stage together with other excellent Hungarian artists, performing the music of our composers, such as Erkel Ferenc, or Lehár Ferenc as well. He has received many awards and honors for his achievements in the field of music, charity and, particularly, cultural relations – including the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic, Commander’s Cross.\n\nBased on the former, on behalf of the Doctorate Senate of the University of Pécs, we wish to pay tribute to Maestro Plácido Domingo through conferring an honorary doctorate on him.\"\n\nAcceptance speech:\n\n\"It is a privilege for me to stand here today and to be honored by this great, historic institution. I am keenly aware not only of the importance of the University of Pécs in Hungary’s academic and cultural history, but also of the city’s motto – “The Borderless City” – and its reputation as a place of ethnic and religious tolerance. This is more and more important in today’s world, when we see so much ethnic and religious intolerance. Ideally, Pécs’s motto should be the motto of every city in the world.\n\nI first visited Hungary in 1973, and throughout my career I have worked with outstanding Hungarian artists in the world of opera: the conductor Sir Georg Solti and the singers Eva Marton, Gabor Carelli, László Polgár, Andrea Rost, Sylvia Sass, Júlia Várady, and Ilona Tokody. Tibor Rudas was the impresario who organized the Three Tenors concerts, and my assistant Nicholas Zoltán Marko, has worked with me for over thirty years are also Hungarians. I hardly need to say that I have great love and respect for the music of Hungarian composers – Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Franz Liszt, Franz Lehár, and Ferenc Erkel, among others. Not to mention the fact that as a passionate fan of the Real Madrid football team, in the city where I was born, I was a great admirer of Ferenc Puskás, who was one of our star players for many years.\n\nIn recent years I have come to feel a special gratitude toward Hungary and have become familiar not only with Budapest but also with Pécs. In 2009, the year before Pécs became the European Cultural Capital, my OPERALIA World Opera Competition held its quarter-finals and semi-finals here and its finals in Budapest. Each year, OPERALIA is held in different world cities – London, Madrid, Milan, Beijing, and so on – and it was wonderful to be able to bring it to Budapest and Pécs as well. I have also had the privilege of performing in both cities many times in the past years.\n\nAs a singer, conductor, and administrator, it is my privilege and my responsibility to help the wonderful art of opera, which is now over 400 years old, to as many people around the world as possible. Similarly, as president of Europa Nostra, a citizens’ movement for the safeguarding of Europe’s cultural and natural heritage, I am particularly aware of the importance of cities like Pécs, which preserve so much of what is valuable and important in the history of this continent. And I repeat: the motto of “Borderless City” should be a model around the world.\n\nSo it is with a mixture of pride and humility that I gladly accept today the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the great, historic University of Pécs, and I thank everyone involved for having conferred this honor on me.\"\n\nAbout the ceremony »\n\nDate of inauguration: 2016. február 7.\n\n2015\n\nAbhaykumar R.
