With this addition, MDPI now operates 21 offices in 12 countries worldwide. Claude Seo, with over 20 years of experience in the academic journal publishing industry, including Nature Publishing Group (NPG), has been appointed as the Office Manager of the Seoul office.\n\nWith the establishment of a Seoul office, MDPI aims to actively support Korea scientific communities to further promote the publication of OA journals in the region. As of the end of 2023, Korea ranked sixth worldwide in both submissions and publications of MDPI research papers. MDPI is the number one OA publisher in Korea.\n\nSungkyunkwan University Joins MDPI’s Institutional Open Access Program\n\nIn addition, MDPI announced that Sungkyunkwan University joined MDPI’s Institutional Open Access Program (IOAP). This program offers free access to MDPI online submission system for the institutions and APC discounts to affiliated authors. Thirteen major Korean universities, including Sungkyunkwan University, Kyung Hee University, Chung-Ang University and Catholic University of Korea, have adopted IOAP in Korea.\n\nOA aims to break down barriers that have traditionally restricted access to science, ensuring that knowledge is available to all, regardless of financial situation or institutional affiliations. Authors, academia, and scientific communities are rapidly moving toward OA. MDPI has been at the forefront of reshaping the academic publishing landscape, with OA surpassing subscription-based publishing in 2020.\n\nMDPI CEO Visits Seoul, Korea\n\nIn March, Stefan Tochev, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MDPI, visited Korea and met with various stakeholders including government agencies, research and academic institutions, universities. During his visit, Stefan highlighted that MDPI continues to pave the way for a world where science is accessible to all, supporting a global community of inclusive innovation and collaborative solutions.\n\nStefan expressed excitement about the new venture, stating, \"Today marks a significant milestone for MDPI as we celebrate the opening of our new office in Seoul, Korea. This expansion is more than just an increase in our physical footprint, it is a pivotal step in our ongoing commitment to making scientific knowledge more accessible, participatory, and inclusive across the globe.\"\n\nClaude Seo, reflecting on his new role, commented, \"I am delighted to have been offered this position of trust within MDPI, the no. 1 scholarly OA publisher. As we establish our presence in Korea, we are dedicated to integrating into the local community and contributing to its vibrant culture. Our commitment goes beyond business growth; it is about creating a more informed and innovative society by embracing and promoting diversity within the scientific community.”\n\nFor further inquiries, please contact our Seoul office directly.\n\nAbout MDPI\n\nA pioneer in scholarly, open access publishing, MDPI has supported academic communities since 1996. MDPI is leading the transition to open science by making more research free and accessible to everyone. Over 3.3 million researchers have entrusted MDPI with publishing their scientific discoveries. MDPI’s editorial process is bolstered by a network of dedicated reviewers, a team of 6000 diligent, well-trained staff members, and an in-house article submission platform that was designed to ensure efficient processes within its 430 fully OA titles.\n\nMDPI has been a strong proponent of the open access publishing model right from the beginning. As one of the pioneering fully open access publishers, we firmly believe that unrestricted access to research findings forms the foundation for better transparency, efficiency, and quality control across all scientific disciplines.\n\nIn December 2022, we reached a significant milestone by surpassing one million articles published. That is one million articles freely available to all, to circulate and build upon!\n\nOffering free and immediate access to scientific papers empowers scientists to examine, validate, replicate, and expand upon existing results. This not only helps prevent redundancy and optimizes how resources are used but also paves the way for innovative new approaches.\n\nThe International Open Access Week takes place from 23 to 29 October 2023, providing a unique opportunity to connect the global movement towards open sharing and open science with the progress of policy transformations at the local level.\n\nOur goal, during Open Access Week as well as throughout the year, is to offer resources for educating people about the benefits of open access publishing. The MDPI Blog offers a wealth of information around open access and open science.\n\nPromoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration\n\nOpen access publishing embodies the fundamental values of democratizing knowledge and fostering global accessibility. It aims to break down barriers that have traditionally limited access to scholarly work, ensuring that knowledge is available to all, regardless of their financial or institutional affiliations.\n\nDiscounts are part of our commitment to ensuring there are diverse pathways to Open Access publishing for researchers worldwide. MDPI supports scientific communities in several different ways.\n\nOne of the key strengths of open access publishing lies in its ability to facilitate interdisciplinary research. By removing paywalls and promoting the sharing of knowledge across disciplines, OA encourages collaboration and innovation. Researchers from diverse fields can access and build upon each other's work, fostering a holistic approach to addressing complex global challenges.\n\nFunders' policies are getting aligned with open science\n\nGovernments, institutions, and funding agencies have recognized the transformative potential of open access and have implemented policies to promote it. These policies often mandate that publicly funded research should be made openly accessible. Such initiatives have accelerated the growth of open access repositories and journals, reinforcing the commitment to open access principles. Check our spotlights on OA policies in the US, EU and China.\n\nOpen access publishing is continually evolving, with innovative and community-driven models and technologies shaping its future. Initiatives like \"Plan S\" and \"cOAlition S\" promote the adoption of OA publishing from the national funders’ perspective by requiring grantees to publish their research openly. A new policy announced by the US administration last year requires that, as of January 2026, all US federally funded research be made freely and immediately available after publication.\n\nAdditionally, preprint servers such as MDPI's Preprints.org, which allow researchers to share their findings before formal peer review, have gained popularity, enhancing the speed at which new knowledge is disseminated. The rise of blockchain technology is also being explored to ensure transparency and authenticity in scholarly publishing.\n\nFor more than twenty years, open access scholarly publishing has been revolutionizing academia by promoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration. Its support for interdisciplinary research, evolving policies, and innovative practices all contribute to its growing influence in the global research community. As open access continues to expand, it holds the potential to democratize knowledge, advance science, and drive positive societal change.\n\nMDPI is proud to be a leader in the transition to open access.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the winner of the Diversity 2023 Young Investigator Award—Dr. Zhichao Zhou.\n\nName: Dr. Zhichao Zhou\n\nAffiliation: Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA\n\nWebsite: https://zczhou2017.wixsite.com/mysite\n\nDr. Zhichao Zhou is an Assistant Scientist in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA. Dr. Zhou’s research interests are in the metagenome- and metatranscriptome-based interpretations of biogeochemical functions and activities, environmental and energy dynamics mediated by microorganisms, microbial community interactions, the environmental microbiome, the virome, and population genomics. Dr. Zhou received his Ph.D. in 2017 and has an outstanding publication record, comprising 47 publications in peer-reviewed international journals. His Google Scholar citation number is 2147, and his H-index is 23. He is a rising star in the field of environmental microbiomes and viromes. As a single applicant, Dr. Zhou has obtained multiple awards, including the Lorus J. and Margery J. Milne Scholarship (2016, MBL Microbial Diversity Course), the third prize of Polar Science Excellent Paper (2012, State Oceanic Administration of China), and a University Postgraduate Fellowship (2012, the University of Hong Kong). These are outstanding achievements in today’s competitive environment.\n\nWe thank the award committee for their hard work in the difficult task of selecting a winner from such a large number of exceptional candidates. We also thank all the nominees from various fields for their participation. We will continue to reward young scientists with the Young Investigator Award, and wish them every success in their careers.\n\nThe following is an interview with Dr. Zhichao Zhou:\n\n1. Can you briefly introduce yourself to our readers?\n\nI spent my childhood in a small town in central China and went on to study biology at Wuhan University. During my studies, I discovered a strong interest in microbiology and excelled in microbiology experiments. After completing my undergraduate studies, I pursued my graduate studies in Hong Kong, where I developed a range of molecular microbiological skills and gained experience in studying the molecular ecology of marine microbiology. I came to the United States before the pandemic and joined my current lab to study the marine microbiome and virome, especially focusing on the ecosystem of hydrothermal vents. In my free time, I enjoy riding my bicycle, listening to music, and exploring the woods. Furthermore, I am a big fan of brewed foods and drinks, such as beers, frozen yogurt, and chocolate, which are gifts from microorganisms to human beings.\n\n2. What are you currently researching, and what made you choose this field?\n\nIn the later stage of my Ph.D. studies, I recognized the growing importance of high-throughput sequencing and large-scale data processing in microbial ecology and took the initiative to develop my skills in these areas with the help of my Ph.D. advisor. After completing my studies, I spent several years in a dry-experiment-based lab studying microbial evolution and ecology while also refining my bioinformatic skills. I am now an Assistant Scientist in Dr. Karthik Anathanraman’s lab, where I am leading a project on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of freshwater lake viruses over a 20-year period. Our goal is to analyze changes in viral populations in response to seasonal and physicochemical variations by harnessing bioinformatic and statistical techniques. The freshwater lake—Lake Mendota—located just to the north of our university campus, is a research hotspot to study the microbiome and virome dynamics during a long-course time series. It is a very important component of the US Long-Term Ecological Research Network for North Temperate Lakes. The research outcome will significantly contribute to the current understanding of viral ecology and diversity, which leads to impactful influences on local freshwater lake environments.\n\n3. Have you had difficulties to overcome in your work? How did you approach those situations?\n\nThere will always be difficulties in researching science since many originally planned attempts may not work. Sometimes, small mistakes will lead to a big problem and cause lots of energy and time to re-check the whole pipeline. Sometimes, debugging the script itself is also painful and tends to be very stressful. At these times, I first try to take a deep breath, calm down, and re-organize my thoughts. Then, for me, making a to-do list and detailed time plans is usually a way to overcome these tough problems or tedious issues. Breaking down complex tasks into small, manageable steps and maintaining focus on one step at a time can lead to a more effective approach to finally achieving the goal. During each step, confidence will be established, and I will be more skillful and familiar with the problem.\n\n4. What qualities do you think young scientists need?\n\nPersistence, diligence, good habits, and a clear mind.\n\n5. We are an Open Access journal. How do you think Open Access impacts authors?\n\nOpen Access journals can allow all academic members to access the publications easily. They also tend to have a wide range of editors and reviewers, which leads to a more diverse and open-course peer-reviewing system. Now, many society journals have changed to full or partial Open Access. I think this will be the trend of the future.\n\n6. As the winner of this award, is there anything else you would like to say or anyone you would like to thank?\n\nI want to thank my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Ji-Dong Gu, who initially encouraged me to apply for this award. He guided me to this field, offered me lots of opportunities to reach out, and is still my advisor on many issues even today. I express my special gratitude to him.\n\nFor more information about Diversity awards, please refer to the following link: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diversity/awards.\n\nName: Dr. Simon Blanchet\n\nAffiliation: Station d’Ecologie Théorique et Expérimentale, UAR 2029, Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique, 09200 Moulis, France\n\nInterests: freshwater ecology; population (epi-)genetics; ecosystem functioning; host-parasite interactions; evolutionary ecology; habitat fragmentation; conservation biology, fish ecology and evolution\n\nThe following is a short Q&A with Dr. Simon Blanchet, who shared his vision for this Section with us, as well as his views of the research area:\n\nWhat appealed to you about the journal that made you want to take the role as its Section Editor-in-Chief?\n\nEditing manuscripts is an enjoyable part of a researcher's work. I see this as a way to improve my knowledge of biological diversity and to sate my curiosity about biodiversity and science in general. I also like the idea of knowing a bit more about what people are doing around me in this small world. Thus, this new opportunity to go a step further in the editing process is very exciting to me.\n\nWhat is your vision for the journal?\n\nJournals focusing on the description and understanding of diversity patterns across biomes and taxa are rare. This is surprising because this is actually the basis of the work of ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Diversity is filling this gap, and I think that the journal has a long life ahead of it, as we still have a lot to discover in this area. Thus, my vision for the journal is to continue its goal of describing the diversity patterns of all forms while maintaining a high scientific standard. I also would like the journal to move toward publishing mechanistic papers aiming to further understand why we observe these diversity patterns.\n\nWhat does the future of this field of research look like?\n\nIt looks like a molecule, a DNA molecule. We are all developing innovative methods to survey biological diversity. These methods are often very high-tech; I would guess that the future of the field of biodiversity science will be \"high-tech\", but I actually hope that it will also move toward a lower-tech approach so as to keep our naturalist minds open.\n\nWhat do you think of the development of open access in the publishing field?\n\nOpen access is an important development as it guarantees the free distribution of scientific content to all people on Earth. Nonetheless, it must be developed in such a way that all scientists around the world can publish, even if they don't have the funding to pay for open access services. A right balance must be found among scientists around the world.\n\nWe warmly welcome Dr. Simon Blanchet to his new role as Section Editor-in-Chief, and we wish him every success in his research and in the development of the journal.\n\nDiversity Editorial Office\n\nFounded in 1996, MDPI was one of the first fully Open Access publisher. Over 25 years MDPI has grown to become the largest Open Access publisher globally, publishing over 160,000 articles across more than 350 journals in 2020. At the core, MDPI was founded in response to a pressing need of fast publication and inclusion. The scholar was set at the centre of the publication process for the first time. Acting as a service provider, rather than a product provider, MDPI exists to help scientists achive their objective to disseminate research results. At MDPI, we believe scientists deserve a better service from the publishing world.\n\nThe International Open Access Week (Open Access Week), founded by the SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) Alliance and student partners in 2008, has been successfully running for 13 years. As an advocate and pioneer of open access publishing, MDPI actively responds to the call of International Open Access Week. This year’s theme of “It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity” highlights the Recommendation’s call for equitable participation from all authors and readers.\n\nFor the last 25 years, MDPI has been committed to disseminating open research. Here is a video showing MDPI’s Commitment to Equity, Inclusion and Diversity for More than 25 Years.\n\nInternational Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress in the building of more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. MDPI has always aimed to provide professional and efficient publishing services to scholars around the world.\n\nOur mission is to make scientific research accessible to everyone; this year, we interview and hold discussions with open science ambassadors on how to build an equal and inclusive environment for open science. Academic editors help us collaborate with more institutions to advocate for open access ideas.\n\nRead our anniversary blog post: \"Sharing 'Collective Human Knowledge': The Benefits of Open Access Publication\"\n\nBesides this, our scientific community is a key driver of our success and MDPI’s remarkable growth. Despite the pandemic, we have prepared online conferences and workshops to gather scholars from different communities.\n\nThe Basel Sustainable Publishing online forum provides an equal opportunity for stakeholders and researchers from multi-cultural environments to exchange ideas and eliminate barriers to participation.\n\nConference date: 25 October 2021, online\n\nConference website: https://bspf2021.sciforum.net/\n\nMain topics: MDPI discusses the current dilemma of open access science from various perspectives such as governments, libraries, and publishers, and related measures on how to change the status quo of discrimination from a global perspective.\n\nWe aim to support equality, inclusion, diversity, and accessibility in scholarly communications. We collaborate with universities and key laboratories and have scholarly communications with researchers, teachers, and students on open access workshops.\n\n25 October 2021\n\nEnergies journal and Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\n28 October 2021\n\nMachines journal and State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University\n\n29 October 2021\n\nProcesses journal and Beijing Institute of Technology\n\n29 October 2021\n\nCoatings journal and Wuhan University of Technology\n\nMDPI is committed to providing open access and high-quality publishing services for scholars and promoting rapid dissemination of academic achievements.

Acknowledgement of our past achievements provides the strongest stimulus for future endeavor.\n\nTo date, the journal Cancers has published more than 1000 papers and will receive its first impact factor in June. This milestone could not be achieved without our readers, authors, peer reviewers, editors, and all the people working for the journal who, for years, have contributed their tremendous efforts.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Samuel Mok\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Cancers\n\nTen years is a long time but a short period for a new journal. When we started Diversity 10 years ago, we had hoped that a journal with such a broad coverage of topics would attract potential authors and good contributions. We are very satisfied that our vision became reality.\n\nToday, Diversity is home to interesting studies on different aspects of diversity mainly in biology, ranging from systematics, phylogeny and evolution, to ecology, biodiversity and conservation issues. I am confident that the next 10 years will witness the further growth of Diversity both in quality and quantity.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Michael Wink\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Diversity\n\nTen years have passed from the foundation of the “Future Internet” MDPI journal. We have witnessed the positive evolution of our journal, with ever-increasing interest from potential authors. The increasing fundamental eco-systemic importance of the journal’s subjects has also had positive effects. Therefore, the journal is currently evolving to cope with the increasing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary views.\n\nPast achievements and future prospects give us reason to celebrate ten years since the journal’s foundation. We will also set up a commemorative Special Issue.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Dino Giuli\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Future Internet\n\nIt is with great pride that Nutrients enters its 10th year of publication. Through the hard work and dedication of its Editorial Board, journal staff, and individuals who have unselfishly given their time to peer-review manuscripts, the journal has grown to become a leading publisher of nutrition research. During this 10th Anniversary year of Nutrients, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all who have contributed to the journal during its first decade.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Jonathan Buckley\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Nutrients\n\nI am pleased and honored to celebrate the first decade of Pharmaceutics, as the founding Editor-in-Chief. This is also an opportunity for me to thank our authors, readers, reviewers, and editorial board members for their continuous support. We will receive our first impact factor in June 2018, in recognition of the great efforts made in the past ten years. We shall strive to improve the journal in the next ten years.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Yvonnne Perrie\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Pharmaceutics\n\nSince its foundation in 2009, Polymers has evolved into an internationally renowned and successful Open Access journal. The core concept, namely that Open Access publishing can stand for high-quality publications, is working well. On a daily basis, ever since the journal’s foundation, the editorial team and the editorial board dedicate themselves to ensuring a high-quality rigorous peer-review process: only 30 to 50% of the submissions will be published in Polymers. This strategy been complemented by, among other features, the increasing impact factor of Polymers, the most recent one being 3.364. On the occasion of Polymers’ 10th anniversary, we would like to thank all authors who have contributed to the success of the journal by submitting their high-quality research papers. We look forward to your continuous support and the continued growth of the journal in the next decade.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Alexander Böker\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Polymers\n\nMDPI’s Open Access journal Remote Sensing is now one of the top international scientific journal 's in remote sensing science. Well known scientists in the subject, from all over the world, publish in it on a regular basis. It has an outstanding and dedicated editorial team, editorial office, and reviewers. We pride ourselves on publishing high-quality original scientific articles. Our goal remains to become # 1 Journal in Remote Sensing Science.\n\n— Dr. Prasad S. Thenkabail\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Remote Sensing\n\nThe tenth anniversary of Sustainability is a momentous milestone, and it has been a privilege for me to be a part of it as Editor-in-Chief. This anniversary demonstrates the growing interest in and recognition of the importance of sustainability. The journal has been able to showcase the many advances made over the last decade in the thinking, methods and applications surrounding sustainability. Recently, the content of the journal has reflected the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was adopted by the United Nations in September 2015. Sustainability has had a notable impact and expects to have an even greater impact over its next decade through publishing research on new advances in sustainability and fostering critical discussion.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Marc A. Rosen\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Sustainability\n\nOur journal Symmetry celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2018. During the last 10 years, the journal has become one of the leading journals among all multi-science journals. This shows the fundamental role played by the symmetries of nature in natural science. This also reflects the huge number of researchers whose work relates to symmetry. We hope to achieve even better results in the coming years.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Sergei D. Odintsov\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Symmetry\n\nIt is my honor as Editor-in-Chief of Toxins to inaugurate the 10th anniversary of the journal’s inception. From the founding EIC, Professor Florian Lang and EIC Vernon Tesh and the many Section EICs and Editorial Board Members, the combined leadership of this effort to provide an outstanding vehicle for the dissemination of the results of high-quality scientific investigations and in-depth, insightful comprehensive reviews has resulted in the flagship journal of toxinology as we know it today. The publication metrics associated with Toxins support this claim by virtue of our increase in manuscript submissions and publications and annual citation rate of articles published in Toxins. Importantly, the impact factor for Toxins remains strong and representative of the significance of the science published in Toxins. As we progress in this anniversary year, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary with a continuation of our acclaimed travel award program for Post-Doctoral Fellows in the field of Toxinology as well as our soon to be announced “Toxins' 10th Anniversary Top Cited Researcher Award” program.\n\nThus, 2018 will be an exciting year, celebrating the 10th anniversary of Toxins, but also a year of looking forward for the best practices by which the journal can serve the toxinology community. With that in mind, please join us in celebrating the journal by submitting your work to Toxins and as always I welcome your suggestions for the improvement of “our” journal.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Jay W. Fox\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Toxins\n\nThank you to all the dedicated researchers, reviewers and editors who have made Water a success. The journal has become a popular outlet for cutting-edge research in the broad field of water science, technology, management and governance. The Open Access format has proven to be attractive, and authors highly value the quick handling of papers. After ten years, Water has become an established journal in the field.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Arjen Y. Hoekstra\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Water\n\nTo mark the anniversaries, we have established a Special Issue to look back over the previous decade of outstanding accomplishments and highlight innovative frontier research perspectives. We encourage you to keep an eye on the publications in this Special Issue and this journal, and hope you consider it as a venue for your future publications.\n\nCape Town will host the 6th World Sustainability Forum at the Cape Sun Hotel on 27 and 28 January 2017. This prominent event, held for the first time in Africa, will include many illustrious South African and international experts, such as Her Excellency Graça Machel (Sustainable Development Advocate for the United Nations, Mozambique), Joyene Isaacs (HoD Agriculture Western Cape Government), Jeffrey Sachs (Columbia University, USA), Max Bergman (SRaM, University of Basel), Mark New (Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Cape Town), Frans Swanepoel (FutureAfrica, University of Pretoria) and Francis Petersen (Vice-Chancellor-designate, University of the Free State). The Forum will provide a stage for national and international debates on sustainability in South Africa, the African continent, and about international perspectives on sustainability. It brings together researchers and representatives from government and the business sector to discuss a wide-ranging set of issues associated with sustainability, including food security, water and energy scarcity, mining, poverty reduction, climate change, and urbanisation.\n\nThe next few decades will be marked by profound changes in the relationships between global economics, national societies, and the environment. We have entered what some call the Anthropocene, an age in which human activity dominates the climate and the environment. These changes will have numerous consequences on societies around the globe. South Africa and Africa will play a central role, for better or worse, in creating opportunities and risks during these changing times as Africa is profoundly influencing and being influenced by global developments.\n\nThe adoption of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015 was accompanied by what insiders considered an optimism they have not experienced in relation to UN resolutions before. The relative efficiency in the drafting, the lack of trenches between East and West, or between North and South, and the unanimity of support of the 193 countries speak volumes. In stark contrast, sustainability seems to go against a changing economic and political tide, where waves of nationalism and protectionism from some of the most powerful countries risk the wellbeing of the rest of the world. The 6th World Sustainability Forum will enable fruitful exchanges, which sensitise South African and international communities to the global urgency and specifics of sustainability.\n\nThe Forum will showcase the work of internationally renowned researchers and include more than 150 presentations. During the conference dinner, the World Sustainability Award, associated with a US$ 100 000 prize, will be announced, as well as the Emerging Sustainability Leader Award, associated with a US$ 10 000 prize. The prizes are sponsored by the MDPI Sustainability Foundation and Sustainability, an academic open access journal by MDPI. The World Sustainability Forum is preceded by the Postgraduate Forum on Sustainability, which will introduce more than 100 young scholars from South Africa and the African continent to sustainability research. Both events are organized and sponsored by the University of Cape Town, the University of the Western Cape, the University of Basel, MDPI, and by the National Research Foundation of South Africa.\n\nContacts:\n\nScientific Matters: Prof Manfred Max Bergman, Social Research and Methodology Group (SRaM), University of Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]\n\nPress Accreditation and General Enquiries: Mr Matthias Burkhalter, MDPI AG, Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]; Tel. +41 61 683 77 34\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n#WSF2017SA"
