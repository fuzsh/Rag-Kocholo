        "text": "Allowance officers Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies on the eve of the First World War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexander P. Abramov\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available On the basis of historical material provides information on measures of state and military administration on the eve of the First World War to improve the welfare of Russian officers and Austro-Hungary, through various forms of material incentives, which are reflected in the cash payments, promotions, awards and social guarantees. On the basis of archival materials of the study period, open scientific publications and Internet resources there are disclosed the features of the destination of salaries, various allowances and compensations Russian army in comparison to the Austro-Hungarian army, who spoke Russian opponent in the First World War. The author notes that the existing system of money allowances in the Russian army was more advantageous than in the Austro-Hungarian army. However, neither one nor the other could not fully meet the needs of the majority of officers of both armies, entered as opponents in the First World War. One of its major shortcomings, both in Russia and in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was a wide gap in the amounts of all kinds of money allowances between chief officers, staff officers and generals.\n\nGenetic Research and Hungarian \"Deep Ancestry\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNÃ¡ndor Dreisziger\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The past few decades saw the birth of the new science of genetics that can be used not only for medical purposes but also for the study of the past. Geneticists were quick to begin applying this science to the examination of Hungarian history, especially the subject of Hungarian origins. The purpose of this paper is to acquaint the reader with some of these studies. One study this paper will examine is itself a review of the scientific literature of early genetic studies on Hungarian origins. Other studies evaluated in this paper will be the English-language scientific publications of a team of Hungarian geneticists who over the last several years have studied the genetic inter-relatedness of 10th century and present-day Hungarian populations in the Middle Danube Valley of Central Europe. The paper comes to the conclusion that while very early genetic inquiries into Hungarian origins were often fault-ridden and are of little use now, more recent studies suggest that the currently held explanations of Hungarian ethnogenesis â especially the story of the so-called Hungarian conquest of the late 9th century â might very well be subjected to a fundamental re-assessment.\n\nTHE SZEKLERS AND HUNGARIANS FROM ROMANIA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGR. P. POP\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The Szeklers and Hungarians from Romania. This study regards, as its main topic, the possibility of establishing at present, a geodemographical entity on Romaniaâs territory, since certain representatives of the Hungarian ethnical minority in our country, and with a particular insistence of those in the vicinity of the western border, always remember to bring into view the problem of establishing an autonomy, common to a SzÃ©kely Land, located in the central area of our country, which would include MureÅ, Harghita and Covasna counties. Without carrying out a detailed account of this situation, it needs to be mentioned, just as it will emerge of the following presentation, that such an approach has neither the most reduced geodemographical support, since the Szeklers, after being assimilated by the Hungarian ethnic group, are no longer present at the census of 20 October 2011. By taking into account the above mentioned aspects, in order to be able to respond to the insistent requests for autonomy in Transylvania, we proceeded to highlight, through a fairly detailed approach of the Hungarian ethnical minority, obviously in point of the number of inhabitants and of their distribution on Romaniaâs territory, resulting of this the fact that the number of Hungarians is of 1,227,623 people, value which related to those 20,121,641 inhabitants of Romania, means 6.10%. The total number of mentioned Hungarians is characterized by a pronounced concentration on Romaniaâs territory, standing out by creating a corridor with a diagonal aspect, on the northwestsoutheast direction, consisting of seven counties, the first four (Satu Mare, Bihor, SÄlaj and Cluj being registered with 2.01% (404,561 inhabitants of those 6.10% Hungarians, the following three (MureÅ, Harghita and Covasna accounting for 3.03% (609,033 inhabitants, and hence in the corridor are present 5.04% (1,013,594 Hungarians of 6.10% at the level of the entire country.

Schwartz examines to what degree the rapes are positioned as a âruptureâ in the first person narratorsâ lives, and how the three narratives offer elements of a âvocabulary of ruptureâ (Butalia 2000 so as to work through traumatic memory and thus come to terms with both the short-term and long-term effects of trauma and social stigmatization. Even though the narratives eschew a black-and-white portrayal of the rapists, an orientalist stereotying is nonetheless present. Schwartz concludes with Avery Gordon that these and other rape narratives can be read as part of the process of settling the ghosts of a still unresolved past violence yet beyond simple ideological binaries along the victim-perpetrator line.\n\nEmotional Intelligence of Hungarian Teachers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaracsi, Ãgnes\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe research focused on the personal and social competencies of Hungarian teachers as unexplored areas. The participants in the survey were 707 Hungarian teachers from elementary and secondary schools. In view of the expectations of the European Union related to new teacher roles, the following research question was formulated to guide the study:â¦\n\nBrief retrospection on Hungarian school atlases\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKlinghammer, IstvÃ¡n; JesÃºs Reyes NuÃ±ez, JosÃ©\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe first part of this article is dedicated to the history of Hungarian school atlases to the end of the 1st World War. Although the first maps included in a Hungarian textbook were probably made in 1751, the publication of atlases for schools is dated almost 50 years later, when professor ÃzsÃ¡iÃ¡s Budai created his \"New School Atlas for elementary pupils\" in 1800. This was followed by a long period of 90 years, when the school atlases were mostly translations and adaptations of foreign atlases, the majority of which were made in German-speaking countries. In those years, a school atlas made by a Hungarian astronomer, Antal VÃ¡llas, should be highlighted as a prominent independent piece of work. In 1890, a talented cartographer, ManÃ³ Kogutowicz founded the Hungarian Geographical Institute, which was the institution responsible for producing school atlases for the different types of schools in Hungary. The professional quality of the school atlases published by his institute was also recognized beyond the Hungarian borders by prizes won in international exhibitions. Kogutowicz laid the foundations of the current Hungarian school cartography: this statement is confirmed in the second part of this article, when three of his school atlases are presented in more detail to give examples of how the pupils were introduced to the basic cartographic and astronomic concepts as well as how different innovative solutions were used on the maps.\n\nTAXONOMY AND STRUCTURE OF HUNGARIAN PERSONALITY-TRAITS\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSZIRMAK, Z; DERAAD, B\n\nThis study reports on the application of the principles of the lexical approach to a non-Indo-European language, namely Hungarian. This language is a Uralic island surrounded on all sides by Indo-European languages. In addition, the Hungarians are, in terms of cultural features, Europeans.

Because of their impoverished health care system, unregulated heavily industrialized society, and unhealthful life-styles Hungarians were hypothesized to have poorer health status than Americans, even after taking into account demographic mediating factors. The study provides a health status baseline for elderly Hungarians shortly after communism's fall in 1989-1990 and shows how great a gap exists between Hungarian health status and that in the West. Hungarians were in much poorer health as measured by functional status, symptomatology, medical condition, depression, and subjective health status. Distinctions persisted when controlling for gender, age, and education. Poverty-level (and income) did not explain health status differences. The paper concludes that Hungary should pay more attention to health promotion, prevention, and primary care, as well as to reforming patient management in hospitals, nursing homes, and home care programs.\n\nTHE BIOGRAPHY OF JÃNOS NAGYVÃTHY - THE FIRST HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURAL WRITER\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGÃ¡bor LUKÃCS\n\n2002-03-01\n\nFull Text Available 210 years ago NagyvÃ¡thy JÃ¡nos published the first systematic, agricultural trade book, called ÂDiligent FarmersÂ in Hungarian in Pest. This outstanding person of our agricultural history was born on 19th January 1755, in Miskolc. After leaving the Protestant secondary grammar school in Miskolc, he studied law and theology in SÃ¡rospatak. At the Protestant secondary grammar school in Losonc he became a ÂSubrectorÂ, that is, the the teacher of poetry. Due to a serious illness affecting his eyes he left this job and went to Pest for medical treatment. During the long therapy he visited the lectures of Mitterpacher Lajos, who was the most excellent theoratical agricultural specialist in the country. In 1782 he took military service for four years, in the Duka cavalry regiment, where he reached the rank of a captain and he was garrisoned in Belgium, Italy and Austria. As a commisariat officer he got to know the more developed agriculture of Europe, and it was at that time that he studied agricultural technical literature. In 1786 he had a relapse of his eye disease therefore he left the army and tried to find a cure in Vienna. Here he got acquainted with JordÃ¡n PÃ©ter, director of the domains of the court, who employed him as an assistant. During the time he spent in the domain of VÃ¶slau, he could completed his academic knowledge with practical experience. In 1788 he moved to Pest where he made friends with Kazinczy, BatsÃ¡nyi, Verseghy and SzÃ©chenyi Ferenc, who were the representatives of the most progressive group of nobility. He became the member of the ÂMagnanamitasÂ Masonic Lodge. In 179o he published four pamphlets anonymously called Â The change of religionÂ, ÂCivil prediction from the starsÂ, ÂThe red friendÂ, ÂHours of joy in the life of a true Hungarian patriotÂ. In 1791 he published ÂThe diligent farmerÂ in two volumes on 1213 pages recommending it to the Âsweaty Hungarian farmerÂ. In this book he wrote about all his\n\n4.

Our purpose is to remove the misconceptions and fears that have arisen around the nuclear techniques, mainly nuclear energetics, and to reply to the questions brought up by the Hungarian youth on this topic. This year, our main activity was to take part in the Student Island with a Nuclear-tent. In this paper we delineate our experience that we have gained with the help of our programmes about the attitude and knowledge of the Hungarian youth.

Drecin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Ilie Miscutia (1893 -? was born in the city of Jula (Bichisghiula, Gyula -today in Hungary, at the border with Romania considered until today âthe great city of the Romaniansâ a Romanian-Serbia family. A graduate of the trade Hungarian School in Lipova; in 1913, he is recruited by the Austria-Hungary army where he attends a Special Course of information. During the Austro -Hungarian-Serbia war (1914-1915, he will be infiltrated as a spy within the Serbia geographical territory. In 1918, along with the decomposition of the Austria- Hungary he joins the political forces in Transylvania that will prepare the Unification from Alba Iulia. We find him, as an officer in the Romanian military units in Prague, then in Budapest in close to the Romanian Central National Council, and in Arad becomes âthe guard bodyâ for Stefan Cicio-Pop. He accompanies the delegation of the Transylvanian Romanians that shall submit to the King Ferdinand, in Bucharest, the act of Unification of Transylvania with the Romanian Kingdom. Within theframework of the Diligent Council in Sibiu, the secretary dr.Eugen Bianu is appointed as the head of the Safety Service in Transylvania and Banat. Since 1 January 1919, he is incorporated in the Romanian Army in the framework of the Organizational Section of the Body VII Sibiu Army, named with the rank of sub -lieutenant in the Intelligence Service of the same Army Body. Between 1918-1920 he takes part to the defense of the city and the Committee of Arad and the Committee Bichis (Bekes today in Hungary, against the Hungarian nationalist guards and of the French army of occupation which were playing the game of the governments in Budapest, watching even keeping the Romanian west in the Hungarian state.

This fact can be due to the phenomenon that in the case of hydronyms, name-giving and name-usage is driven mainly by communicative needs, while other (e. g. socio-cultural or political) factors only rarely influence name-giving. In my paper, it was my aim to provide an etymological typology of Hungarian hydronym...\n\nLessons from Objects: Designing a Modern Hungarian Childhood 1890-1950\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAmber Winick\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Art and architecture assisted Hungaryâs delivery into modern Europe, and many Hungarian designs of the early twentieth century invoked the child rather than the adult as the ideal citizen. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Hungarian designers, design reformers and the Ministry of Culture and Education expressed national identity through design, emphasizing objects and spaces for children as a key element in defining a national culture. This research unfolds a vital dimension of Hungarian culture by examining a selection of objects and spacesânursery designs, childrenâs clothing, school architecture, the Budapest Zoo and book illustrationsâmade for Hungaryâs children during different periods of the last century. Working in partnership with the IparmÅ±vÃ©szeti MÃºzeumâthe Museum of Applied Arts in Budapestâas well as several public and private collections across Hungary, I researched a number of important childrenâs designs that helped to shape the lives and experiences of twentieth century Hungarian children.Â Central to my research is how social and political forces shaped designs and how these designs helped children identify as Hungarian citizens. Looking at five material case studies, I hope to demonstrate the ways in which designers negotiated issues of Hungarian identity, tradition, and modernity.\n\nUS-Hungarian Relations Ten Years After 1956\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTibor Glant\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available 1966, the tenth anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, was a key year in USâHungarian relations. Diplomatic relations were raised from the lowest to the highest level, but suspicion and tension remained. Neither side knew what to expect from the other on account of the anniversary, the Vietnam War, economic and cultural negotiations, and the fate of Cardinal Mindszenty. A traditional diplomatic historical approach is supplemented here with cultural materials to present the full scale of contacts ranging from high political issues to the visit of Hollywood movie star Kirk Douglas in Budapest. First Secretary of the Legation for Press and Cultural Affairs Edward Alexander receives special attention, because he played a crucial role in the events of 1966. As press secretary, he helped calm Hungarian fears over what American journalists might report about the anniversary, while as cultural affairs officer he worked on documenting and expanding American cultural presence in Hungary. In the latter capacity, he opened the USIA Library at the Legation, fraternized with blacklisted painters of the ZuglÃ³i KÃ¶r [âZuglÃ³ Circleâ], monitored the Hungarian stage production of My Fair Lady, and reported on the publication of American literature in Hungarian.\n\nHungarian University Students' Misunderstandings in Thermodynamics and Chemical Kinetics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTuranyi, Tamas; Toth, Zoltan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe misunderstandings related to thermodynamics (including chemical equilibrium) and chemical kinetics of first and second year Hungarian students of chemistry, environmental science, biology and pharmacy were investigated.

Leo, Gertrude, and Michael, three siblings from the Stein family, a family of Jewish origin from San Francisco, along with Michael's wife Sarah, not only built within the space of a few years the most important contemporary art collection in Paris, but through their lively salons came to be the most influential shapers and propagators of universal modernism, making their influence felt to this day on assessments of avant-garde art. In the course of preparations for the exhibition and the publication of the accompanying catalogue, both of which provide a comprehensive survey of the Steins' activity, light was cast on the family's Hungarian connections as well. Consequently, one painting by the Hungarian Vilmos Pelrott-Csaba was included at the American venues (San Francisco and New York of the exhibition, and a presentation on the family's ties to Hungary was held at the scholarly conference organized in connection with the exhibition. Despite the fact that several essays have been published on this subject, the written sources have not been collected â neither those dealing with the large number of Hungarians present at the Steins' Saturday evening gatherings, nor those covering the Hungarian pupils at the AcadÃ©mie Matisse, which was closely aligned with the Steins. This essay is a revised version of the presentation held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, supplemented with additional source-material.\n\nRama in the royal title of the Hungarian kings\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÅ½ivkoviÄ Tibor D.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The region (Å¾upa of Rama was enlisted in the official title of the Hungarian kings around 1138, as it is known from an official document. The exact answer to the question under which circumstances it happened has never been reached. It is most probable that Rama was not just other name for Bosnia as it was proposed in historiography, neither was a part of Bosnia conquered by military action of the Hungarian king around 1135. Having in mind that Rama was a part of the principality of RaÅ¡ka during the Early Middle Ages, it is quite possible that Rama became part of the official title of the Hungarian kings through some direct connections between ruling families of Hungary and RaÅ¡ka. The most probable answer could be reached through the examination of these relations. Namely, a daughter of RaÅ¡ka's Å¾upan, UroÅ¡ I, Helena, was married to the Hungarian crown prince Bela in 1129, when Rama was, most probably, part of Helena's dowry. When the crown prince became king of Hungary in 1131, Rama was included in his royal title. Later on during the Middle Ages Rama became part of Bosnia giving ground to the Hungarian kings to claim whole Bosnia as their heritage. .\n\nThe Representation of Jews in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Hungarian Proverb Collections\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIlana Rosen\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Proverbs are concise formulations of folk wisdom and as such, when seen in masses, they may well express the spirit of their time and place. In Hungarian proverbial lore Jews figure prominently in nineteenth-century proverb collections but fade out of such collections as of the mid-twentieth century. In the nineteenth-century proverb collections Jews are invariably portrayed as faithless, dishonest, greedy, physically weak and unattractive. Largely, this portrayal as well as the dynamics of the earlier presence of Jews versus their later disappearance from Hungarian proverb collections match the shared history of Hungarians and Hungarian Jews since the 1867 Emancipation of the country's Jews and possibly even earlier, through their growing integration in significant arenas of their host society, up to their persecution and annihilation in the Holocaust, and later their decade long forced merging into the general Hungarian society under communism. This article traces the occurrence and disappearance of Jews in Hungarian proverb collections throughout the last two centuries and analyzes the language, content and messages of the proverbs about Jews in these collections.\n\nReceptiveness to Flexible Employment at Hungarian SMEs\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃkos EssÅsy\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Nowadays, only companies that are adaptable and flexible in their structure and processes can survive. The basis for a motivated company aiming for peak performance is organisational innovation. Hungary is one of the less innovative countries in Europe. Only organisations that can integrate new solutions smoothly into their everyday operations will remain truly competitive. The Government of Hungary, in its Partnership Agreement with the European Union, set out the goals for improving and supporting the adaptability of enterprises, the promotion of flexible and family-friendly workplace practices and services, and the employment of women with young children. The aim of this study is to demonstrate, through a Hungarian example, the receptiveness of Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises to flexible forms of employment. The effect of flexible employment on economic adaptability and competitiveness through workforce efficiency and retention is examined. Its aim is the raise the awareness of options to increase employment among Hungarian SME managers.\n\nFragments of a Hungarian Past in the Literature of 1.5 and Second-Generation Austro-Hungarian Immigrants in Israel\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIlana Rosen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Contemporary Israeli literature is presently preoccupied with the past diasporic lives of the previous generation, the one that came to Israel from practically all four winds in the mid-late twentieth century. Hungarian-Israeli writersâe.g., Yoel Hoffmann, Judith Rotem, Yael Neeman and Esti G. Hayimâconstitute a distinct group within this stream of 1.5 and second generation poets and novelists who have written about immigration and State foundation, often using a documentary or fictionalized memoirist mode. This article highlights the components of these writers' complex burden of a whole world destroyed, in most cases, not long before they were born and which they strive to restore or at least re-imagine in their oeuvre as contemporary Israeli writers. These components include: Holocaust trauma and its transference to the second generation, Hungarian speaking families within the Israeli multicultural setting, the ties of these families with their Hungarian foreign relatives, and household objects related to this past.\n\nEstimating wage equations for Hungarian higher-education graduates\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGalasi, Peter\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe paper investigates the wage determination of Hungarian highereducation graduates with using two samples of Hungarian careerbeginners, applying IV techniques and the multiple indicator solution so as to diminish potential estimation biases due to endogeneity of independent variables (especially the education variable) and the simultaneity of wages and working time. The results show that university education yields considerable wage premium as compared to college education, and that the ret...\n\nLexical Borrowing in the Speech of First-Generation Hungarian Immigrants in Australia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnikÃ³ Hatoss\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This article reports findings of a sociolinguistic project which investigated language contact phenomena in the speech of first-generation Hungarian Australians living in Sydney. The research aimed to identify and analyze English lexical items borrowed into the spoken Hungarian of first-generation HungarianâEnglish bilinguals. This research had a mixed methods approach including a quantitative element (count of lexical manifestations by categories such as part of speech and a qualitative element in which the various lexical manifestations have been subjected to a linguistic analysis. The Hungarian National Corpus was used as a reference guide to determine the status of these phenomena in the lexicon of Standard Hungarian. The data were collected through semi-structured sociolinguistic interviews with 22 Hungarian Australians living in Sydney. The findings demonstrate that (a first-generation Hungarians are highly creative language users and integrate a large number of English lexical items into their speech. Most lexical borrowings belong to the derivational blends with the highest proportion of the nominal group. Lexical borrowings from English are morphologically integrated with Hungarian-derivational suffixes and inflectional case markings. This research provides original empirical data to better understand the various inter-language lexical manifestations in HungarianâEnglish bilingual contexts. The study adds to the relatively small body of research on HungarianâEnglish bilingualism in diasporic context and contributes to understanding lexical borrowing from a contact linguistic perspective.\n\nSociolinguistic and Contact-induced Variation in Hungarian Language Use in Subcarpathia, Ukraine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIstvÃ¡n CsernicskÃ³\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In addition to showing regional and social variation, the language use of the minority Hungarians of Subcarpathia, Ukraine, also presents a reflection of the regionâs complex linguistic history and its effects from contact with Russian and Ukrainian. On the basis of quantitative empirical findings, this study shows Subcarpathian Hungarians to be a sociolinguistically stratified group of speakers whose Hungarian language use varies in a systematic manner according to sex, age, level of education, and place of residence. The paper also outlines some of the main differences in the language use of Hungarians in Subcarpathia and Hungary which are manifested in statistically significant ways.\n\nHungarian Minority Politics in Post-Socialist Romania: Interests, Strategies, and Discourses\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTorÃ³ Tibor\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper analyses the integration strategies formulated by the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and the Hungarian political elite in the post-communist period. It argues that the internal debates of the political community are formulated in a field where other actors (the Hungarian and the Romanian state, political parties, European institutions, etc. carry out their activities, which deeply influences both the chosen strategies and the needed resources for their implementation. Moreover, it questions the monolithic organization of the minority organization, showing that DAHR as the representative of the minority community was shaped by several internal debates and conflicts. Also from 2003 these conflicts have grown beyond the borders of the organization and since 2008 we can follow a whole new type of institutionalization. In achieving this, I introduce three strategies - individual integration, collective integration, and organizational integration - which are chosen by different fragments of the Hungarian minority elite both toward the Hungarian and the Romanian political sphere. Throughout the 1989-2012 period, the outcome of the conflict between the supporters of these strategies is deeply influenced by the policies of the two states.\n\nTranslating Shakespeare for the Hungarian Stage: Contemporary Perspectives\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBÃ¡lint Szele\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents trends in todayâs Shakespeare translation in Hungary based on interviews with Hungarian translators and scholars. Instead of a collection of names and dates of translators and translations, it focuses on the organic development of Hungarian Shakespeare translation, which has been going on for more than two hundred years, and tries to fit new developments into the tradition of translating Shakespeare in a theoretical framework. âHungarian Shakespeare,â now seen as a broad collection of Hungarian translations and adaptations, lives on, is kept alive in theaters, but it is undergoing a process of simplification. It was very hard work to do away with the forced prudishness and mannerism of the nineteenth century Shakespeare translations. After World War II, during the dominance of Communist culture, it was not allowed for several translations of Shakespeare to co-exist, so a politically appointed committee was set up to decide which one fit into the official canon. Only the selected texts could be printed and used in performances. After the political changes in Hungary in 1989, there was an upsurge of interest in Shakespeare, and since the 1990s there has been an unprecedented plurality of Shakespeare translations. I aim to examine the processes that led to the development of todayâs easy-to-understand and naturalistic translations, and to the abandonment of century-old classical ones.\n\nPOPULISM AS A DISCOURSE OF HUNGARIAN ELITES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. BozÃ³ki\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Since the end of the 19th century populist movements emerged as significant actors of the Hungarian politics. The attempts to assess populism appeared to be as ambiguous, as the attempts by politicians and pundits to describe it. The study of its development demonstrates that it is not linked to the traditional division between left and right, but represents dissatisfaction with the established elites in the society. The article considers changing nature of Hungarian populism on different stages of national history. Specific attention is devoted to the content and value of populist policies in the current Hungary.\n\nA New Adaptive Hungarian Mating Scheme in Genetic Algorithms\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChanju Jung\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In genetic algorithms, selection or mating scheme is one of the important operations. In this paper, we suggest an adaptive mating scheme using previously suggested Hungarian mating schemes. Hungarian mating schemes consist of maximizing the sum of mating distances, minimizing the sum, and random matching. We propose an algorithm to elect one of these Hungarian mating schemes. Every mated pair of solutions has to vote for the next generation mating scheme. The distance between parents and the distance between parent and offspring are considered when they vote. Well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the traveling salesperson problem, and the graph bisection problem are used for the test bed of our method. Our adaptive strategy showed better results than not only pure and previous hybrid schemes but also existing distance-based mating schemes.\n\nBayesian inference of genetic parameters on litter size and gestation length in Hungarian Landrace and Hungarian Large White pigs\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZoltÃ¡n CsÃ¶rnyei\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Genetic parameters of number of piglets born alive (NBA and gestation length (GL were analyzed for 39798 Hungarian Landrace (HLA, 141397 records and 70356 Hungarian Large White (HLW, 246961 records sows.

His artistic trajectory shows a movement from documentary style realism (Family Nest, 1979 towards more modernist cinematic practices (Satanâs Tango, 1994, Werckmeister Harmonies, 2000, and The Man from London, 2007. A major celebrity in the global film culture that prides itself in being transnational, international, and in crossing linguistic and ethnic boundaries, Tarr has consistently found himself on the fringes of the Hungarian cultural and political establishment. In this study TÅke considers Tarrâs films and public persona as catalysts in the debates about what constitutes âHungarian cinemaâ in a globalizing world from the 1970s until today.\n\n[Motivations for foreign employment and carrier change among Hungarian physiotherapists].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPÃ³nusz, RÃ³bert; KovÃ¡cs, Dalma; Raposa, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Bence; Hock, MÃ¡rta; Decsi, TamÃ¡s; KrÃ¡nicz, JÃ¡nos; Endrei, DÃ³ra\n\n2016-02-28\n\nAn increasing motivation can be experienced among professional workers within the Hungarian healthcare system towards foreign employment or career change. The aim of the authors was to assess Hungarian physiotherapists' migration and career changing behaviour and to understand the underlying factors. A national survey in Hungary from April to August, 2014 was performed. Only physiotherapists who practice in Hungary were included (n = 215). The results suggest that age (pappreciation experienced in the workplace (pappreciated, are 55 times more likely to search for employment outside the country's borders [OR = 55.28 CI (95%) = 18.85 to 161.12].

It is located in the very center of the capital, only some blocks away form the Parliament. Most people on this side of the Atlantic may not even have heard about the Hungarian currency, the Forint. Some may remember that after the WWII it was Hungary, where the severest hyperinflation in the world took place. As we come from a manufacturing company , we can give you information about deliberation and experiences of application of optically variable features on banknotes and some observations made in the past two years since the new Hungarian bank note series is ins circulation.\n\nReflections on the Status of Hungarian Loanwords in Old Romanian Translations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPÃ¡l EnikÅ\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Translation has always been important for religion as a way of preaching God's word. The first Romanian translations of religious texts, including the first (although incomplete translation of the Bible, date from the sixteenth century. In this early period of Romanian writing, Romanian translators encountered several problems in conveying the meaning of these texts of a great complexity. Some of the difficulties were due to the source texts available in the epoch, others to the ideal of literal translation, to the principle of legitimacy or to the relatively poor development of Romanian language which limited the translators' options. The present study focuses on the causes and purposes for which lexical items of Hungarian origin interweave old Romanian translations. In this epoch, Hungarian influence was favoured by a complex of political, legal, administrative and socioculturel factors, sometimes even forced by these circumstances. On the one hand, given the premises of vivid contacts between Romanians and Hungarians in the regions where the old Romanian translations (or their originals can be located, a number of Hungarian loanwords of folk origin penetrated these texts. On the other hand, when using Hungarian sources, translators have imported useful source language caiques and loanwords, which have enriched Romanian language.\n\nThe stigmatization of obesity among Gypsy and Hungarian children.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPapp, IldikÃ³; TÃºry, Ferenc\n\n2013-06-01\n\nPrejudice against obese people has been widely confirmed in scientific papers. Therefore, recent studies have increasingly focused on investigating the individual and cultural factors related to attitudes towards obesity. Since there have been no comparative studies involving Gypsy people, our present research aimed at exploring the possible discrepancies in children's attitudes towards obese children between Gypsy and Hungarian cultures. Our survey included 247 children aged 9-16 (108 boys and 139 girls), of which 136 considered themselves Hungarian (55.1Â %), while 111 children (44.9Â %) claimed themselves as Gypsy. The subjects were asked to rank six male and six female figure drawings according to their preference. Each sequence of figure drawings included a healthy child, an obese child, and four drawings depicted children with disabilities. According to our results, the drawings portraying the healthy child figure were rated most preferable and those portraying the obese child figure the least preferable amongst the subjects regardless of gender and origin. However, the obese girl figures and boy figures were rated significantly more positively by Gypsy children than Hungarian children. Our results suggest that there is a difference in attitude towards obesity among Gypsy and Hungarian children. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further explore this phenomenon.\n\nBrahms J.

Exactly how many Jewish dermatologists were killed is not known. We have identified 62 Hungarian Jewish dermatologists from this period: 19 of these dermatologists died in concentration camps or were shot in Hungary, 3 committed suicide, and 1 died shortly after the Holocaust, exhausted by the War. Fortunately, many Hungarian Jewish dermatologists survived the Holocaust. Some had fled Europe before the Nazi takeover, as was described in Part 1 of this contribution. Two Holocaust survivors, Ferenc FÃ¶ldvÃ¡ri and ÃdÃ¶n Rajka, became presidents of the Hungarian Dermatologic Society and helped rebuild the profession of dermatology in Hungary after the War. This contribution provides one of the first accounts of the fate of Hungarian Jewish dermatologists during the Holocaust and serves as a remembrance of their suffering and ordeal. Copyright Â© 2016.

We also report Clubiona neglecta O. P.-Cambridge, 1862 (previously only mentioned in a table in a Hungarian-language dissertation. The genus Acantholycosa (Dahl, 1908 was hitherto unknown in Hungary, yet expected to occur. The family Oecobiidae Blackwall, 1862 is new to the Hungarian fauna. The Southeast-Asian neozoon Pandava laminata is also recorded as new to Hungary. All further species found to be new to the Hungarian fauna or described in Hungary after the most recent publication of a Hungarian spider checklist are briefly mentioned.\n\nLinguistic Representation of Emotions in Japanese and Hungarian: Quantity and Abstractness\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMÃ¡rton SZEMEREY\n\n2012-05-01\n\nFull Text Available In the present paper, two linguistic aspects of emotion expression are studied in the form they are performed in present day Japanese and Hungarian. After a brief summary on the recent emotional researches connected to Japanese culture and language, the concept of Linguistic Category Model is introduced. The quantitative study presented afterwards investigates emotion expression in terms of amount and abstraction. Translations were used for comparison and the results showed that 1 Japanese tend to use less explicit emotion terms compared to Hungarians and 2 emotion language in Japanese is characterized by the choice of less abstract phrases compared to Hungarian. These findings are discussed in the light of their relevance to former researches of cross-cultural psychology and linguistics.\n\n[Love on enemy territory: Belgrade, Cetinje and Lublin under Austro-Hungarian occupation in World War I].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nScheer, Tamara\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDuring World War I, Serbia and Montenegro were under Austro-Hungarian occupation between late 1915/early 1916 and 1918. This article explores the attitude of the occupiers towards prostitution and venereal disease, among the indigenous population as well as among their own soldiers, officers and female support staff. The measures taken were primarily guided by military considerations. For the military, the occupied areas were zones that served particular purposes, such as preserving peace and order behind the front, making use of manpower and resources, and serving as cordon sanitaire. In spite of this, pseudo-peace-like structures evolved in the capitals Belgrade and Cetinje that facilitated the spread of prostitution and venereal disease. In my article, I will look at the scale of the debate and of the proposed countermeasures. It is noticeable that women were usually branded as the perpetrators, while the soldiers were seen as the ones in need of protection. In spite of this, it is apparent how candidly the royal-imperial army dealt with the topic even though it went against the current ideas of morality. The social differentiation that was customary in the imperial and royal army applied here, too. Officers suffering from venereal disease had their own hospitals and brothels and were permitted leave more often (a fact that went against the purpose of these institutions). The topic also received publicity because the military physicians, who were in fact civilians mobilized by the army, chose to publish continuously on the topic. Based on the microcosm of occupied enemy territory, my contribution shows how ideas of morality changed during the war despite traditional gender stereotypes, and the role played by the military in these developments.\n\nResearch on Relative Age in Hungarian Swimming\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNagy Nikoletta\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In 2017, the 19th World Swimming Championship will be organized in Hungary. Up to now, many people have already been working with swimmers to achieve good results. However, in the next period they must work even harder to ensure that the national swimmers of a country as small as Hungary can achieve the outstanding results of their predecessors. Since high-level competitions in swimming have become more intense, innovations including scientific studies are needed during preparation for the event. The purpose of this paper is to present the major results of an independent study carried out by the authors about the relative age of the best Hungarian swimmers with the aim of contributing to their preparation. The research population consisted of selected age groups of swimmers registered by the Hungarian Swimming Association (N=400. The method for data collection was an analysis of documents. To evaluate the data, the Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. The results are presented according to the period of the competitorâs date of birth, gender, and age group. The results confirm only partly the hypothesis that people born in the first quarters of the year play a dominant role in Hungarian national swimming teams. In the conclusion, the authors recommend further research on relative age in swimming and in other sports.\n\nTwenty years of isotope applications in the Hungarian aluminium industry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBujdoso, E.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nAfter a short review of the isotope techniques applied in the Hungarian aluminium industry some special applications and their results are briefly outlined.

One of them is the charter issued on behalf of the nuns from the Monastery of the Holy Theotokos in VeszprÃ©mvÃ¶lgy. The charter was written in the Greek language, and has been the subject of many studies. The original has not been preserved; what remains is a copy from the time of King Coloman, dated to 1109. The charter has not been published in a critical edition in any language other than Hungarian and even though it has been examined by numerous Hungarian scholars, many questions remain open. The aim of the author is to provide a critical edition and an English translation of the charter, but also to clarify some remaining doubts about the charter and its contents. Furthermore, some comparisons will be made with the Byzantine charters issued at the beginning of the 11th and during the 12th century.\n\nThe First Steps to a New Comprehensive Slovenian-Hungarian Dictionary: The Analysis of Relevant Bilingual Resources\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJÃºlia BÃ¡lint Äeh\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents the analysis of existing bilingual Slovenian-Hungarian dictionaries, which was made as part of the project aiming to design a concept for a new comprehensive Slovenian-Hungarian dictionary. First, a short historical overview of Slovenian-Hungarian lexicography is provided, including first collections of dialect vocabulary, glossaries, and collections and dictionaries of idioms. Then, an overview of Slovenian-Hungarian and Hungarian-Slovenian dictionaries is made, the first one being published in 1961. The paper then focuses on a comparison on three Slovenian-Hungarian dictionaries, which are currently used by majority of users, namely Slovenian-Hungarian part of the dictionary by Elizabeta Bernjak (1995, Slovenian-Hungarian dictionary by JoÅ¾e Hradil (1996, and Slovenian-Hungarian part of the Hradilâs bidirectional dictionary. The dictionaries are compared in terms of size, headword list, coverage, headword presentation, grammar information, as well as in terms of other elements of dictionary microstructure such as translations and examples. The discussion section includes an analysis of the coverage offered by the dictionaries of the vocabulary compilled by teachers at bilingual schools in Prekmurje. The results indicate that the coverage of various levels of vocabulary, frequent or rare, is rather poor; as dictionaries are medium-sized and outdated, this is to be expected, however as the analysis shows, some basic concepts are also often not covered (e.g. research, death, allergy. The second part of the discussion is dedicated to the presentation of selected examples of good practice in bilingual lexicography, such as Comprehensive English-Slovenian dictionary Oxford-DZS as the first bilingual dictionary in Slovenia to use the corpus-based approach, as well as offer much more contextual information on the headwords. Also presented are English-Spanish online dictionaries by Oxford University Press and Collins, the focus\n\nLong memory in the Croatian and Hungarian stock market returns\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSilvo DajÄman\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the fractal structure of the Croatian and Hungarian stock market returns. The presence of long memory components in asset returns provides evidence against the weak-form of stock market efficiency. The starting working hypothesis that there is no long memory in the Croatian and Hungarian stock market returns is tested by applying the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS (1992 test, Loâs (1991 modified rescaled range (R/S test, and the wavelet ordinary least squares (WOLS estimator of Jensen (1999. The research showed that the WOLS estimator may lead to different conclusions regarding long memory presence in the stock returns from the KPSS and unit root tests or Loâs R/S test. Furthermore, it proved that the fractal structure of individual stock returns may be masked in aggregated stock market returns (i.e. in returns of stock index. The main finding of the paper is that both the Croatian stock index Crobex and individual stocks in this index exhibit long memory. Long memory is identified for some stocks in the Hungarian stock market as well, but not for the stock market index BUX. Based on the results of the long memory tests, it can be concluded that while the Hungarian stock market is weakform efficient, the Croatian stock market is not.\n\nEarly Morphological Productivity in Hungarian: Evidence from Sentence Repetition and Elicited Production\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGabor, Balint; Lukacs, Agnes\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper investigates early productivity of morpheme use in Hungarian children aged between 2 ; 1 and 5 ; 3.

Michael Curtiz, the Korda brothersâAlexander, Vincent and ZoltÃ¡nâAndrÃ© de Toth, Emeric Pressburger, Vilmos Zsigmond, MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa, Peter Lorre, GÃ©za von RadvÃ¡ny and other talented artists have crossed borders, cultures and languages, creating such classics as Casablanca, Somewhere in Europe, The Red Shoes and The Lost One. The legendary sign posted in Hollywood studios read: \"It is not enough to be Hungarian, you have to have talent, too!\" Accompanied by film extracts, rare footage, personal interviews, archive photographs, and documentary materials, my presentation explores the transnational odysseys of these Hungarian directors, producers, cinematographers, composers, actors and screenwriters whose artistic contributions became an indispensable part of international cinema, suggesting that the challenges of emigration may also offer opportunities for critique, self-examination and artistic creativity.\n\nEducating Hungarian medical librarians in special literature.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJantsits, G\n\n1974-01-01\n\nIn Hungary the completion of a thirty-month course is required of those who wish to qualify as medium-level librarians. Medical librarians are given a special course which differs from the general course in that it covers the subjects of medical terminology and information in special literature. The latter subject is accorded the highest number of teaching hours, since the subject matter is vast and since, in addition to theory, much time must be spent on exercises and the presentation of reference books. The students become familiar with the main Hungarian and foreign information systems in the medical and related fields and with special bibliographies, encyclopedias, handbooks, and dictionaries. We take special care to familiarize students with the abstracting journals and indices. For several semesters they have homework and lesson exercises in the use of the Hungarian Medical Bibliography and Index Medicus.\n\nRadiology education in Hungarian schools\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMarx, G.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBasic concepts of nuclear physics are not more abstract and more difficult than those of electricity.

The Hungarian translation of the HGSHS:A was administered under standard conditions to 434 participants (190 males, 244 females) of several professions. In addition to the traditional self-scoring, hypnotic behavior was also recorded by trained observers. Female participants proved to be more hypnotizable than males and so were psychology students and professionals as compared to nonpsychologists. Hypnotizability varied across different group sizes. The normative data-including means, standard deviations, and indicators of reliability-are comparable with previously published results. The authors conclude that measuring observer-scores increases the ecological validity of the scale. The Hungarian version of the HGSHS:A seems to be a reliable and valid measure of hypnotizability.\n\nNamed Entity Recognition in a Hungarian NL Based QA System\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTikkl, Domonkos; Szidarovszky, P.

Indirect effect is realized through the law legislation and the direct one by the operate of the different venture capital firms and funds which invest public financial sources. The main purpose of the direct intervention is to finance the under-capitalized small and medium-sized start-up companies with equity. The paper examines the Hungarian venture capital market from the aspect of state intervention. It starts with an European overview which summarizes the common and different attributes of stateâs role in the venture capital market between several European countries. The paper focuses on the Hungarian situation, it describes concisely the effect and efficiency of the governmental instructions which were taken for the legislation of the venture capital market. Using the results of a previous research the paper also examines the characteristics of the direct instructions. The paper decribes briefly the main details of the publicprivate initiative called JEREMIE-program, which started on the Hungarian venture capital market in the recent past.\n\nThe Hungarian environmental private law under the influence of jus publicum\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJulesz MÃ¡tÃ©\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The relationship between environmental public law and environmental private law is of a growing significance. Not only environmental criminal law has an effect on environmental private law, but, since the beginning of the new legal, economic and political era in 1989, private law elements are also to be found in the environmental administrative law. The reciprocity between environmental private and administrative law is clear-cut. Private law institutions, like injunction or deposit, are upheld in environmental administrative contracts. The effect of an administrative ruling has legal consequences in the relationship between, e.g., neighbors: there are cases in which a noisy neighbor can be brought before the public administration. The objective liability in the field of environmental private law is accepted by the courts and by the citizens. The level of objectivity may, though, vary from country to country. In the practice of the Hungarian environmental private law, after 3 years, the objective liability is subrogated by a subjective liability, this latter one making exculpation easier. The res ipsa loquitur liability in space law is not an absolute liability, though it establishes a praesumptio juris that the environmental damage caused by a space object (e.g. a satellite is to be covered by the state which has sent the satellite into space. The presumption is, though not easily, rebuttable. In the Hungarian case law, objective environmental liability has been applied sub judice since the novella of the Civil Code in 1977. This novella made environmental private law a part of environmental law. The novella of the Civil Code was preceded by the Act on Environmental Protection of1976. The importance of economics in environmental private law has only recently been accepted by the Hungarian legal science. The role of the Coase theory is indisputable. The environmental private law is quite a new phenomenon in the Hungarian legal science, however\n\nTHE HUNGARIAN CRISIS: AN AUSTRIAN SCHOOL EXPLANATION\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndras Toth\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The Hungarian model was heralded as one of the most successful post-socialist way of integration into the globalised world economy and European economic area in the nineties. Currently, Hungary is suffering from a full-blown crisis 1996 onwards. Increasingly large number of Hungarians is losing their faith in political parties, institutions, democracy and in market economy. The government, elected in 2010 by supermajority and still enjoying a broad support despite the deepening recession, condemns the development path taken after 1989 and openly rejects the wrong model of the last 20 years. The government intends to build a new economic model following a model, which one can call a model of economic nationalism as the only way out of the crisis. The paper intends to portray, through the case of Hungary, how economy and politics is interconnected, and why political elites are choosing a credit fuelled development path. The paper intends to portray how a credit fuelled growth was induced by politics and ended up in tears. Moreover, the paper describes the consequences of pro-etatist shift in the public sentiment due to the alleged âmarket-failureâ, which was in reality a crisis, at first place, created for political purposes by political means. This article, based on the Austrian business cycle theory, argues that the tragedy of Hungary was that it went through a government inspired spending binge in the first half of the 2000s. The deficit spending of the government was accompanied by the expansion of credit by the commercial banks, mostly denominated in Swiss francs. The combined effect of deficit spending and credit expansion was the build-up of debt and loss of cost competitiveness. The 2008 crisis ended the credit fuelled development path and has started the long and painful period of deleveraging crisis. On the other hand, the Hungarian crisis is a post-Keynesian crisis. It had broken out when the state was already heavily indebted and\n\nHungarian Economic Development Prospects â in the Light of the One Belt and One Road Initiative\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTamÃ¡s NovÃ¡k\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper attempts to delineate the most important aspects of the historical Hungarian economic development path, while shedding light on long-term Chinese investment and trade opportunities in Hungary. In order to make the One Belt and One Road Initiative a success, China needs proper knowledge of the Central European countriesâ long-term development needs and goals. This analysis delivers a first assessment of the basic long-term questions of Hungarian economic development. The paper reviews milestones of economic progress after 1990 until the present, and shortly looks into the effects of the economic transformation of the 90s, and the main repercussions of the Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009. At the end of the paper a short glimpse is given on how the Hungarian economy could develop, and what are the possible development models to be utilized by Hungarian decision-makers. At the same time, it will be clear where Hungarian and Chinese need can intersect each other.\n\nBetween the Word of the Law and Practice: a Case of the Hungarian Speakers in Serbia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMandiÄ Marija\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper initially presents the Serbian legislative framework relevant to the use of minority languages. The ethnolinguistic vitality of the Hungarian-speaking population in Serbia is then analysed, particularly in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. The paper then focuses upon the sociolinguistic survey of Hungarian language use in Belgrade. The emphasis is placed upon the survey responses related to the awareness of language rights among the Hungarian speakers.\n\n[Hungarian Diet and Nutritional Status Survey - OTÃP2014. II.

Three-day dietary records were used for dietary assessment, the sample was representative for the Hungarian population aged â¥18ys by gender and age. The mean proportion of energy from fat was higher (men: 38 energy%, women: 37 energy%), that from carbohydrates was lower (men: 45 energy%, women: 47 energy%) than recommended, the protein intake is adequate. Unfavorable change compared to the previous survey in 2009 was the increase of fat and saturated fatty acid energy percent in women, the decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption, which explains the decreased fiber intake. An increasing trend in added sugar energy percent in each age groups of both genders was observed compared to 2009. Interventions focusing on the promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption and decreasing of saturated fat and added sugar intake are needed. Orv.

As we will show, native speakers of Hungarian tend to use the predicative verbal adverbial construction when translating English passive sentences, as this construction is the closest syntactic equivalent of the English passive voice. Another question to be investigated is whether L2 Romanian works as a facilitating factor in the process of acquiring the L3 English passive voice. If all our subjects, Hungarian students living in Romania, were Hungarian-Romanian bilinguals, it would be obvious that knowledge of Romanian helps them in acquiring the English passive. However, as it will be shown, the bilingualism hypothesis is disconfirmed. Still, passive knowledge of Romanian influences to some extent the acquisition of the English passive voice.\n\nHungarian activity in cosmic physics in the last 20 years\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSzabo, Ferenc.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe Hungarian activity in cosmic physics is reviewed.

The MDS-UPDRS organizing team developed guidelines for the development of official non-English translations consisting of four steps: translation/back-translation, cognitive pretesting, large field testing, and clinimetric analysis. The aim of this paper was to introduce the new MDS-UPDRS and its validation process into Hungarian. Two independent groups of neurologists translated the text of the MDS-UPDRS into Hungarian and subsequently back-translated into English. After the review of the back-translated English version by the MDS-UPDRS translation administration team, cognitive pretesting was conducted with ten patients. Based on the results of the initial cognitive pretesting, another round was conducted. For the large field testing phase, the Hungarian official working draft version of MDS-UPDRS was tested with 357 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) determined whether the factor structure for the English-language MDS-UPDRS could be confirmed in data collected using the Hungarian Official Draft Version. To become an official translation, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) had to be â¥ 0.90 compared to the English-language version. For all four parts of the Hungarian MDS-UPDRS, the CFI was â¥ 0.94. The overall factor structure of the Hungarian version was consistent with that of the English version based on the high CFIs for all the four parts of the MDS-UPDRS in the CFA; therefore, this version was designated as the \"OFFICIAL GUNGARIAN VERSION OF THE MDS-UPDRS'.\n\nSelected English-Language Bibliography of Interest for Hungarian Cultural Studies: 2014-2015\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLouise O.

A mostly Hungarian speaking city for centuries, Szabadka/Subotica suffered the strong pro-Serbian language policy implemented by the Yugoslavian government from the end of the First World War until the dismantlement of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which gave Hungarian and other local minority languages a second chance to survive. Nowadays, Szabadka/Subotica is home to two main language groups, southern Slavic languages such a Serbian and Croatian (over sixty per cent and Hungarian (thirty three per cent. Although Ferdinand and Komlosi employed official figures from the Serbian censuses to determine the size of each group, the situation of each language was mapped through empirical observation of language use in informal conversations, in official signage, and in permanent as well as temporary commercial signage. The results show that the role of Serbian (mostly written in Latin script is dominant in almost all spheres of public life and as a lingua franca among various groups. Nevertheless, Hungarian maintains a strong presence in the city, especially in the center and in its northwestern districts. In this paper, Ferdinand and Komlosi aim to contribute to a better general understanding of group dynamics in bilingual settings and, specifically, to provide a clearer view of the language situation in one of the Hungarian-speaking regions lost by the historic Kingdom of Hungary after World War I.\n\nAbstracts of the â26th Hungarian Conference on Rabbit Productionâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\n26th Hungarian Conference on Rabbit Prod KaposvÃ¡r, Hungary, May 31, 2014\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available About 100 participants attended the 26th Hungarian Conference on Rabbit Production at KaposvÃ¡r, organised byÂ KaposvÃ¡r University, the Hungarian Branch of the WRSA and the Rabbit Production Board.

The reviewed phrasemes concentrate the shock upon collision with the different or evaluation of the experience gained in the continuous communication with the other. The foreign is usually individualized by outlining and exaggerating some of its characteristics using parallels, oppositions, and metaphors. The negative attitudes and judgments prevail over the others: the fear of the collective âIâ losing its own identity creates a negative attitude towards the foreign, distorted, or wrong notion of the other and the different. Many of the idioms reflect interethnic relations from times long gone, and so they are no longer a significant part of the active vocabulary of Hungarians and Bulgarians. Their analysis, however, is of great interest as they preserve the collective memory of the Hungarian and Bulgarian cultural communities and reveal their traditional notions and knowledge.\n\nWhat do the Hungarian young people think about the nuclear?\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPazmandi, T.; Aszodi, A.; Boros, I.; Hanti, A.; Legradi, G.; Petofi, G.

The Serbs had, since medieval times, an awareness of their long history and tradition, great medieval civilization and cultural unity regardless of the fact that they lived under several different adminisÂ­trations. As in the case of Habsburg Serbs, language and literature became building blocks of Croat national consciousness in the nineteenth century. Unlike Serb nationalism centred on people, Croat nationalism was mainly territory-related. Since both Serbs and Croats inhabited the Austro-Hungarian provinces claimed by the Croats as their \"historical Right\" (absorption in 1097 of the small medieval Croat state by the Hungarians is interpreted, by many Croat historians, as a voluntary act of union, the different conceptions of nationalism resulted in competing claims. Croatian politics became one of opposing any recognition of Serbian institutions and cultural characteristics without Serbs previously accepting the concept that the only \"political nation\" in the Austro-Hungarian Province of Croatia was Croatian. Nonetheless, Croats compromised when in need of Serb assistance in opposing Hungarian domination. In turn, Serb politics was divided between those supporting cooperation with the Croats in order to achieve greater autonomy from the Hungarians in the Dual Monarchy, and those who supported some cooperation but insisted on forming an entity separate from the Croats in the future and joining with the Kingdom of Serbia, which regained its independence in 1878. The ensuing world and civil wars brought the Croato-Serb conflict to the fore, with the first and the second Yugoslavia failing to accommodate the two nations' opposing aspirations.\n\nHungarian national nuclear material control and accounting system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLendvai, O.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe Hungarian system for nuclear materials control and accounting is briefly described.

At first glance it may look like that the maintenance of the Transcarpathian Hungarians in Ukraine is guaranteed, however,we have to see that minority education (which is one of the key-issue of the maintenance of the community is threatened by several factors. In the given paper I will take under investigation only two of these factors. On the one hand the Ukrainian state language policy would like to strengthen the position of the state language even at the expense of other languages and education is used as a means of achieving these aims. On the other hand, while education is one of the effective and powerful means of achieving social goals of the minority and choosing the language of instruction is a crucial part of language education policy, minority universities neglect serious language planning activity. It is high time for every institute to work out an individual university language policy taking into account their own aims and personal conditions.\n\nHungarian participation in the intercosmos program\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFerencz, Cs.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nHungarian specialists have been interested in all fields of space research from the beginning.

Advance technology-based applications, capturing interest and attention, influence cognitive focus and time spent with the device. Examination of these factors points toward the risk of addiction, as well as the deprivations sensations associated with the latter, that call for scholastic attention. The aim of this study was to validate a Hungarian Smartphone Deprivation Inventory (HSDI), to gauge the deprivation feelings and their severity in schoolchildren when they cannot access their device. A 9-item, 7-point, agree-disagree inventory was developed on the basis of an earlier exercise deprivation scale (Robbins and Joseph, 1985). The inventory was completed by 258 Hungarian schoolchildren (mean age=12.4 Â± SD = 1.71 years). The participants also completed the Hungarian version of the Brief Addiction to Smartphone Scale (BASS). An exploratory factor analysis of the HSDI yielded a single factor that accounted for 55.84 % of the variance. The internal consistency of the inventory was excellent (Cronbach's Î± = 0.90). Content validity of the HSDI was checked by comparing the scores of those scoring above and below the median on the BASS that yielded statistically significant differences (p smartphone access in schoolchildren.\n\nGenetic analysis of the Hungarian draft horse population using partial mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequencing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground The Hungarian draft is a horse breed with a recent mixed ancestry created in the 1920s by crossing local mares with draught horses imported from France and Belgium. The interest in its conservation and characterization has increased over the last few years. The aim of this work is to contribute to the characterization of the endangered Hungarian heavy draft horse populations in order to obtain useful information to implement conservation strategies for these genetic stocks. Methods To genetically characterize the breed and to set up the basis for a conservation program, in the present study a hypervariable region of the mitochrondial DNA (D-loop) was used to assess genetic diversity in Hungarian draft horses. Two hundred and eighty five sequences obtained in our laboratory and 419 downloaded sequences available from Genbank were analyzed. Results One hundred and sixty-four haplotypes and thirty-six polymorphic sites were observed. High haplotype and nucleotide diversity values (HdÂ =Â 0.954Â Â±Â 0.004; ÏÂ =Â 0.028Â Â±Â 0.0004) were identified in Hungarian population, although they were higher within than among the different populations (HdÂ =Â 0.972Â Â±Â 0.002; ÏÂ =Â 0.03097Â Â±Â 0.002). Fourteen of the previously observed seventeen haplogroups were detected. Discussion Our samples showed a large intra- and interbreed variation. There was no clear clustering on the median joining network figure. The overall information collected in this work led us to consider that the genetic scenario observed for Hungarian draft breed is more likely the result of contributions from âancestrallyâ different genetic backgrounds. This study could contribute to the development of a breeding plan for Hungarian draft horses and help to formulate a genetic conservation plan, avoiding inbreeding while.

Zeynep YELÃE\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The new phase in Ottoman-Hungarian relations starting with the ascension of SÃ¼leyman I and the following period of conflict have been thoroughly examined by scholars; causes and effects have been analyzed; and the process has been evaluated in a wide array of perspectives ranging from evaluations as a process of glorious conquest to a process of tragic enslavement. This paper moves away from such grand narratives to explore the way the process was perceived by contemporaries as they lived through the conflict. As such, this paper focuses on the letters of Lorenzo Orio, the Venetian ambassador in Buda between 1519-1523. From his arrival in Buda on June 5, 1519, to his presentation of his report to the Pregadi on December 22, 1523; Orio has been a close witness of the relations and conflicts between the Ottomans, Habsburgs, and the Hungarians. The information offered by Orio in these tumultuous times, as he tried to present a neutral stance for Venice, has not only added to the soft power of Venice but presents us the experience and perception of an era. In other words, it opens a window to the rumors, gossip, fears, and hopes in the daily lives of the contemporaries.\n\nHungarian Accounting Regulations: Exposed to the Cross-Fire\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRita Ambrus\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of the paper is to highlight two factors influencing Hungarian accounting regulations: the legislation of accounting in the last 25 years and the most important features of the taxation system. Both of them can influence the main requirement of the Hungarian Act on Accounting, the true and fair view. The research methods are based on a synthesis of the national and international literature. The authors examine the regulation system embedded in the legal and economic environment. The paper shows the accounting legislation in Hungary after the changing of the regime, its asymmetry, the attitude of the legislators and the current situation. The analysis of the tax system is connected to the provisions of accounting, highlighting the problems of the tax administration, the relation between corporate tax and the resultsof accounting and the intention to simplify it. The main conclusion is to make the system more flexible, in line with the legal and fiscal institutions, to fulfil its important requirements.\n\nTranslating Welsh Drama Into Hungarian Through English: A Contextual Introduction to SÃªra Moore Williamsâ Crash in Hungarian Translation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMÃ¡rta Minier\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article offers a predominantly contextual introduction to my translation of a contemporary Welsh play by SÃªra Moore Williams, Crash (2004, into Hungarian. Williams' three-person drama for young people was written originally in the author's native language, Welsh, and translated into English by the playwright herself. In my translation process of the play from English to Hungarian the intermediary role played by English raises ethical concerns from a postcolonial perspective, while in a pragmatic sense it is almost a necessity to rely on it when communicating Welsh-language cultural production to the broader international public, including to other minor languages. The article will place the drama in its generic context, introducing the play as a Theater in Education piece, as Williams' work has been inspirational in the development of tantermi szÃ­nhÃ¡z [classroom theater] in Hungary since the early 2000s. As a specific case study within the case study, the additional discussion of the translation of Williams' polysemic title will provide an insight into the role such a significant paratext plays in uprooting a dramatic text from one culture to another.\n\nDecarbonising the Hungarian Electricity and Heat Sectors: What Is the Least impossible?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKaderjak, P.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe presentation will report on an economic assessment of decarbonisation scenarios for the Hungarian electricity and heat sectors by 2050.

The results suggest that CO 2 abatement in the heat sector might be a cheaper and more realistic option for decarbonisation in the Hungarian case. With regard to the electricity sector, decarbonisation foreseen in the Commission's 2050 vision (90-95%) is not feasible without a massive application of CCS technology or without a non-foreseeable technology breakthrough.(author)\n\nEnergy conservation and energy prices: the Hungarian experience\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMolnar, L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe main sources of emissions into the outdoor air are from the energy sector (e.g. power plants), industry, the transport sector and the residential sector (buildings).
