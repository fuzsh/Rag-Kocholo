        "text": "Hungarian athletes won eight gold, three silver and four bronze medals at the 31st Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil this August. This tally of medals puts Hungary on 12th place on the medal table of nations – but analysts also point out that the total of 15 medals is the poorest performance for Hungary in the past 80 years after the ten medals (3 gold, 5 silver and 2 bronze) won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe most successful member of\n\nthe Hungarian team was swimmer Katinka Hosszú who won three gold and a silver\n\nmedal by winning the women’s 200- and 400-meter individual medley events (smashing\n\nthe world record in the latter) as well as the 100-meter backstroke and finishing\n\nsecond in the 200-meter backstroke.\n\nFlatwater kayaker Danuta Kozák had her fair\n\nshare in three other Olympic victories for Hungary: she won Hungary’s 500th Olympic medal as she defended her individual 500-meter title she won in London\n\nfour years ago, she was member (along with Gabriella Szabó, Tamara Csipes and\n\nKrisztina Fazekas-Zur) of the kayak-four team that also defended their London\n\nOlympic title at 500 meters and she – paired with Gabriella Szabó – also won\n\nthe kayak-double 500-meter event in the Rodrigo de Freitas Laguna in Rio de\n\nJaneiro.\n\nThe third sports that produced\n\ngold medals for Hungary was fencing. First, Emese Szász crowned her career by beating\n\nItalian Rossella Fiamingo in the women's individual epée final and then, Áron\n\nSzilágyi defeated Daryl Homer of the United States to defend the saber title he\n\nwon four years ago in London.\n\nApart from Hosszú, swimmer László Cseh (men’s\n\n100-meter butterfly) and fencer Géza Imre (men’s individual epée) also finished\n\nsecond while the Hungarian bronze medalists in Rio included field athlete Anita\n\nMárton (women’s shot put), swimmer Tamás Kenderesi (men’s 200-meter butterfly),\n\nswimmer Boglárka Kapás (women’s 800-meter freestyle) and the men’s epée fencing\n\nteam."
