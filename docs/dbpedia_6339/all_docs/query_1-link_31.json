        "text": "Why did those who had the power to do so not pull in the reins? How could the civilised European populaces celebrate the war? Why did they not choose the path of peace, progress, and constructiveness? On the 109th anniversary of the start of the First World War, and in the shadow of the war of our time, these are the questions historians must answer.\n\nHungary’s place among the nations, and especially in Europe, is one of the most debated issues in Hungarian political thinking. Analysing the so called ‘kuruc–labanc’ dichotomy helps to better understand the present-day disputes between Brussels and Budapest.\n\nThe third day of Tusványos remained as eventful as the previous one, with many prominent Hungarian government officials taking the opportunity to share their thoughts on stage. What follows is a brief recap of the most important points they made.\n\nGergely Gulyás spoke about how if we value our past, then film is one of the most important means of presenting it. He continued by saying that it’s a different question how far back in time one can go.\n\nA brief summary of the most important remarks made by government officials on the second day of the 32nd Tusványos Summer Festival in Transylvania.\n\nThe CEO of BNP Paribas Cardif, Márk István Kiss, noted in the press release presenting the results of the survey that the rising prices and the challenging economic situation have not significantly impacted labour market processes, and the mood of Hungarian employees seems to be stabilising overall.\n\nThe 19-year-old left back is the second Hungarian player to be signed by a Premier League side for a high transfer fee this summer. Kerkez joined Bournemouth only weeks after Dominik Szoboszlai’s transfer to Liverpool was announced.\n\nThe 32nd Tusványos festival, organised under the motto ‘The Time for Peace,’ will offer around five hundred public and cultural events until the end of the week.\n\nTarget deciding to pull some of its controversial LGBT merchandise proves that the conservative consumer base in the United States does have considerable power to counteract the mainstream push of LGBTQ activism, even if the current administration is against them in that fight, unlike in Hungary.\n\nGiven the country profile of Hungary, it is a refreshing achievement that it has moved up a league to Moderate Innovators, even though its performance is 70.4 per cent of the EU average, below the category average, and its performance growth is also slower than the EU average.\n\nThe recipe is kept secret and stored on a computer with high-level security measures, with a backup copy being held in a Swiss vault, the Hungarian energy drinks company highlighted in a statement.\n\nZsolt Gyulay, President and CEO of Hungaroring Sport Zrt., described the preparation process for the race as ‘extraordinary’ because the company not only had to focus on organising the race itself but also on concluding the negotiations for the contract extension, which has been ongoing for several months and could reach a conclusion at the current 38th Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\nDuring the last decade, an increasing academic and intellectual effort has emerged to define and redefine Hungarian conservatism. Better understanding 19th-century conservatives is crucial to this process, as these movements are where the roots of Hungarian conservatism lie.\n\nThe root cause of the riots result from the French state having been unable to eliminate social inequalities and ethnic differences for decades, the panellists at a Migration Research Institute discussion agreed.\n\n‘The significance pilgrimages had in terms of building clerical and diplomatic relations cannot be overlooked either. A whole slew of abbots, bishops, future archbishops, historians, poets, theological thinkers, and monks later canonised as saints visited Hungary. They brought highly cherished relics, luxury items of the East, and—not least—news with them.’\n\nA new photo and video exhibition titled Am I My Brother’s Keeper, curated by Yitzhak Mais, a prominent Israeli historian and former director of Yad Vashem’s historical museum, captures the unique moments of international cooperation to help Ukrainian Jewish refugees.\n\nWith culture and identity often taking centre stage in politics nowadays, economic issues are also increasingly looked at from a cultural point of view. In order to gain a better understanding of present-day social clashes, it is important to examine social changes in the past and their cultural fingerprint, including how literature later reflected on the painful transition to capitalism.\n\nAccording to legend, it was Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna who recommended the inclusion of the colour green in the Hungarian flag, as a symbol of hope.\n\n‘Governor Lajos Kossuth thanked General Guyon for his victory in a letter, writing: “Please accept my and the homeland’s gratitude for your victory won on 14 July. I am looking forward to the rest of your generalship with hope, since where such a brave army is commanded by Guyon with the heart of a lion, nothing but victory can follow.”‘\n\nA short story of a group of desperate young Hungarians who in 1956, disillusioned with socialism, overpowered the passengers and the secret agent on a plane, successfully flew it to Germany, and the leaders of whom eventually became members of the US military.\n\nRubik’s creativity may have stemmed from the fact that he was a typically solitary child who, as he says, was never bored because he loved games. The more challenging the puzzles, the more they occupied his imagination."
