        "text": "– Your first season in Croatia brought you a second place in the league and a Croatian Cup victory. Would you have expected it in advance?\n\n– We wanted to win the league, but we cannot be dissatisfied with the second place either, after all, the club won a silver medal in the topflight after ten years – said Gergő Lovrencsics, 33-year-old defender of Hajduk Split, capped 44 times for Hungary. – And we crowned the season with the Croatian Cup victory against Rijeka.\n\n– How painful was it that you couldn't be in the match squad?\n\n– Unfortunately, two weeks ago in the league against Istra, I suffered a partial ankle ligament tear. My opponent came in from behind, we kicked each other, and I came off badly. Four days later, I was already jogging, I did everything I could to play in the final, but I wasn't 100 percent fit. We didn't want to risk anything. It was more important for me to start my preparations completely healthy in mid-June. There are two weeks of training camp in Austria and there will not be long idles, because, on July 9, we'll have a Super Cup match against Dinamo.\n\n– Are you sure you'll be fine by the start of the preparations?\n\n– Fortunately, I have no problem with the changes of direction, and I can do skipping exercises. Now I was prescribed rest because although I was injured, the gym and running trainings were not missed, and the season was long – I played thirty-four games. So I'd be resting now even if I was 100 percent well.\n\n– Overall, did you get what you expected?\n\n– At the beginning of the season, the European Conference League farewell against Tobol took a toll on everyone, we changed coaches, but after that, we made a lot of progress, and the cup win shows that we are on the right track now. We have become a more united team, the atmosphere is familiar, and it feels good to be here, I have no regrets about signing with Split. In the fall, I was a stable starter, and then in the February league match against Rijeka, my shin was kicked so badly that the skin opened up. After that, I couldn't even put on my shin protector, and Dino Mikanović, who was given the opportunity to take my place, performed well and was stuck in the starting lineup. There is nothing wrong with that, this is football. Fortunately, I was able to add to the team's performance as a substitute, my assist was needed against Dragovoljac to stay in the competition for the title. At the end of the day, I can't complain, but I hope we will do even better next season, we want to win the league.\n\n– How does it feel to be a football player in Split?\n\n– The reception after the cup win says it all. The club won the trophy after nine years, and by the time we got back downtown, the podium was already standing. They called us one by one, the Greek fires were lit up, and then the party lasted until dawn.\n\n– Does this mean you want to spend the next season as well at Hajduk?\n\n– I have one year left on my contract. My family and I are having fun in Split, I have no reason to transfer.\n\n– Where would Hajduk finish in the Hungarian topflight?\n\n– It would certainly be in the race for the gold medal with Ferencváros, but Dynamo, Osijek, and Rijeka would also be involved in this fight. I am convinced that Ferencváros could also improve more if it had to compete with so many strong teams.\n\n– Have you been watching the results of Fradi?\n\n– I have a Hungarian television channel in Split, so when I could, I watched its matches. The season started a little difficult, at first Kisvárda and Puskás academy were behind Ferencváros, but as much as the season started bumpily, it ended smoothly. The two teams mentioned could not keep up in the spring. It's a big advantage that Fradi is used to keeping the level all season; the other clubs can't do that yet. Even if there is a match that does not go according to plan, the players know how to react.\n\n– How will it feel to watch the national team's Nations League matches from the outside?\n\n– I made a decision last summer, and I don't regret it for a minute. I have enjoyed every minute with the national team, but I am not young anymore, I need to pay more attention to regeneration and spend more time with my family. After a busy season, it's not easy to shake up the players, but Marco Rossi will solve the task, I'm sure. In the past, the national team has achieved good results, and we have proven that we can compete with the stronger teams as well. We can do the same this summer, too."
