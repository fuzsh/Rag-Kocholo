As a financial investor, our group performs non-industry specific acquisitions. In most cases, our investments are made by two asset management companies, Westbay Kft. and HO-ME 2000 Vagyonkezelő Kft., 100% within György Nagy’s interest.

Besides decades of venture experience, the success of our investments is guaranteed by seamless cooperation between our experts and partners.
