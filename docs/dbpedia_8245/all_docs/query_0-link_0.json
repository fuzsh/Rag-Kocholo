        "text": "Following is a list of all Article III United States federal judges appointed by President Bill Clinton during his presidency.[1] In total Clinton appointed 378 Article III federal judges, including two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States, 66 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, 305 judges to the United States district courts and 5 judges to the United States Court of International Trade. Clinton's total of 378 judicial appointments is the second most in American history behind Ronald Reagan, and his 305 district court judges is a record.\n\nAdditionally, 8 Article I federal judge appointments are listed, including 1 judge to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and 7 judges to the United States Tax Court. This is not a complete list of Clinton's Article I federal judge appointments.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton's first appointee to the Supreme Court\n\nStephen Breyer, Clinton's second appointee to the Supreme Court\n\nUnited States Supreme Court justices\n\n[edit]\n\nSpeculation abounded over potential Clinton nominations to the Supreme Court even before his presidency officially began, given the advanced ages of several justices. On March 19, 1993, Justice Byron White announced his retirement effective at the end of the Supreme Court's 1992–1993 term.[2]\n\nPresident Clinton announced Ruth Bader Ginsburg as White's replacement on June 15, 1993, and she was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 3, 1993.[3]\n\nOn April 6, 1994, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun announced his retirement, which ultimately took effect August 3, 1994.[4] President Clinton announced Stephen Breyer as Blackmun's replacement on May 13, 1994, with the United States Senate confirming Breyer on July 29, 1994.[5]\n\n# Justice Seat State Former justice Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began\n\nservice Ended\n\nservice Ended\n\nretired service 1 6 New York Byron White June 22, 1993 August 3, 1993 96–3[6] August 5, 1993 September 18, 2020 – 2 2 Massachusetts Harry Blackmun May 17, 1994 July 29, 1994 87–9[7] August 3, 1994 June 30, 2022 Incumbent\n\nCourts of appeals\n\n[edit]\n\n# Judge Circuit Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice Ended senior\n\nstatus 1 Fourth August 6, 1993 September 30, 1993 voice vote October 1, 1993 March 25, 2011 0– 2 Second August 6, 1993 October 18, 1993 voice vote October 20, 1993 August 16, 2002 Incumbent 3 Sixth August 6, 1993 November 20, 1993 voice vote November 22, 1993 January 1, 2009 Incumbent 4 D.C.
