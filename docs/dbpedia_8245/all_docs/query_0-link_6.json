Most, though not all,\n\nof the persons whose nominations were returned at the end of the 103rd, 104th, and\n\n105th Congresses were later renominated and ultimately confirmed. One Clinton\n\njudicial nomination was rejected by Senate vote. President Clinton also withdrew 11\n\njudicial nominations (three to U.S. circuit court judgeships, eight to U.S. district\n\njudgeships), which either encountered difficulties at the committee stage or faced the\n\nlikelihood of substantial opposition on the Senate floor. During the Clinton\n\npresidency, there were 59 roll call votes involving judicial nominations.\n\nAlso, at the start of the 107th Congress, with less than three weeks remaining in\n\nhis presidency, President Clinton submitted ten judicial nominationsânine to the\n\nCircuit Courts of Appeals and one to the Court of Federal Claims. Shortly after\n\nPresident Clinton left office, his successor, George W. Bush, withdrew all ten\n\nnominations but then renominated one of the nine circuit court nominees, who\n\nsubsequently, in July 2001, received Senate confirmation.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nNominations to the Supreme Court of the United States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\nNominations to the U.S. Courts of Appeals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\nNominations to the U.S. District Courts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n\nNominations to the U.S. Court of International Trade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n\nNominations to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n\nNominations to the U.S. Tax Court . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34\n\nNominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n\nNominations to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n\nNominations to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n\nNominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n\nList of Tables\n\nTable 1.

Specifically, the Chief Executive makes judicial\n\nappointments to the:\n\n! Supreme Court of the United States;\n\n! United States Courts of Appeal;\n\n! United States District Courts (including the territorial courts);\n\n! United States Court of International Trade;\n\n! United States Court of Federal Claims;\n\n! United States Tax Court;\n\n! United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims;\n\n! Superior Court of the District of Columbia;\n\n! District of Columbia Court of Appeals; and\n\n! United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.2\n\nJudicial terms of office vary, depending upon the court. Justices on the\n\nSupreme Court and judges on other courts established by Congress under Article III\n\nof the Constitution âhold their Offices during good Behaviourââi.e., they receive\n\nlifetime appointments. In addition to the Supreme Court, the âArticle III courtsâ\n\nconsist of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, the U.S. Court of International Trade, and the\n\nU.S. District Courts in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n1 Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 provides that the President âshall nominate, and by and with\n\nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges of the Supreme Court and all\n\nother Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided\n\nfor, and which shall be established by Law....â\n\n2 The President, it should be noted, does not nominate federal bankruptcy judges (who are\n\nappointed by the United States Courts of Appeals), administrative law judges (appointed by\n\nfederal agencies), U.S. magistrates (appointed by the United States District Courts), or trial\n\nand intermediate court judges in the Armed Forces (appointed by the Judge Advocate\n\nGeneral in each service); nor are these judges subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nCRS-2\n\nAppointment to other courts in the above list entail fixed terms of various\n\nlengths. These are the so-called âlegislative courts,â which are created by Congress\n\nunder divers constitutional authority not requiring lifetime (âgood Behaviorâ) tenure.3\n\nDuring his presidency, William Jefferson Clinton nominated persons to\n\njudgeships on all of the above-listed courts.\n\nIn the following pages, 10 separate sections provide background and statistics\n\nconcerning President Clintonâs judicial nominations to each of the court categories\n\nlisted above.4 Each section begins by briefly discussing the composition and\n\njurisdiction of the court or court system in question. Various statistics are provided,\n\nincluding: the number of nominations to the court which were received, confirmed,\n\nor not confirmed by the Senate during the Clinton presidency; a breakdown of these\n\nnumbers for the 103rd, 104th, 105th and 106th Congresses; and the number of Clinton\n\nappointees who were serving on the court at the end of his presidency. Also noted\n\nis the committee to which nominations to the particular court were referred after\n\nbeing received by the Senate.\n\nThe most common ways in which a judicial nomination fails to receive Senate\n\nconfirmation are these:\n\n(1) The President withdraws the nomination (doing so, for example,\n\nif the Senate committee to which the nomination has been referred either\n\nhas voted against reporting the nomination to the Senate or has made clear\n\n3 Citing the power to do so in Article I of the Constitution, Congress, in separate statutes,\n\nhas created four courts of specialized subject matter jurisdictionâthe U.S. Court of Federal\n\nClaims, the U.S. Tax Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and the U.S.\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forcesâand has authorized 15-year judicial tenure in these\n\ncourts. With similar explicit reference to its powers under Article I, Congress has created\n\ntwo courts of local jurisdiction for the District of Columbia, with judges to these courts\n\nappointed to 15-year terms as well. The territorial courts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and in\n\nGuam have been created pursuant to Congressâ power under the Constitution to âdispose of\n\nand make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property\n\nbelonging to the United Statesâ (Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2); also, Congress has\n\nestablished a territorial district court in the Northern Mariana Islands, which presently is\n\nadministered by the United States under a trusteeship agreement with the United Nations.\n\nFor judicial appointees to the territorial courts, Congress has authorized 10-year terms.\n\n4 The focus of this report is appointments through the process of presidential nomination and\n\nSenate confirmation. Historically, on rare occasions, appointments to these courts also have\n\nbeen made without submitting a nomination to the Senate. This may occur when a President\n\nexercises his constitutional power to make ârecess appointments.â Specifically, Article II,\n\nSection 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the President âto fill up all Vacancies\n\nthat may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall\n\nexpire at the End of their next Session.â During his presidency, Clinton made three judicial\n\nârecess appointmentsââone to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in\n\nDecember 2000, and the two others to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The last prior\n\nPresident to make a judicial ârecess appointmentâ was Ronald Reagan, who did so once\n\nduring his tenure in office. See: U.S. Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service,\n\nPresident Reaganâs Judicial Nominations During the 100th Congress, by Denis Steven\n\nRutkus, CRS Report 89-50 GOV (Washington: Dec. 22, 1988), p. 3.\n\nCRS-3\n\nits intention not to act on the nomination, or if the nomination, even if\n\nreported, is likely to face substantial opposition on the Senate floor, or if\n\nthe nominee has requested that the nomination be withdrawn);\n\n(2) The full Senate votes against confirmation; or\n\n(3) Without confirming or rejecting the nomination, the Senate\n\nadjourns or recesses for more than 30 days, at which time it returns the\n\nnomination to the President pursuant to Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, Standing\n\nRules of the Senate.5\n\nDuring his tenure, President Clinton withdrew 11 judicial nominations.6 One Clinton\n\njudicial nomination was rejected by Senate vote.7 All other judicial nominations\n\nfailing to be confirmed were returned upon a Senate adjournment or recess of more\n\nthan 30 days.\n\nIn a number of instances, when the Senate returned a judicial nomination\n\npursuant to Rule XXXI, President Clinton renominated the individual involved, after\n\nwhich the Senate usually, though not always, confirmed the individual. Each court\n\nsection of this report notes, where applicable, the respective number of nominations\n\nthat were returned by the Senate, were resubmitted by the President, and ultimately\n\nwere confirmed or failed to be confirmed.8\n\nAt the end of each section is a table which lists President Clintonâs nominations\n\nto the court during the 103rd, 104th, 105th and 106th Congresses, respectively, as well\n\nas nine Court of Appeals nominations and one Court of Federal Claims nomination\n\nsubmitted at the beginning of the 107th Congress, in the final days of the Clinton\n\npresidency. Separate columns indicate, for each nomination, the dates of nomination,\n\n5 Paragraph 6 of Senate Rule XXXI provides, in part, that, âif the Senate shall adjourn or\n\ntake a recess for more than thirty days, all nominations pending and not finally acted upon\n\nat the time of taking such adjournment or recess shall be returned by the Secretary to the\n\nPresident and shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made to the Senate\n\nby the President.â\n\n6 President Clinton withdrew one U.S. Court of Appeals nomination and three U.S. District\n\nCourt nominations during the 104th Congress. During the 105th Congress, he withdrew one\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals nomination and four U.S. District Court nominations. During the\n\n106th Congress, he withdrew one U.S. Court of Appeals nomination and one U.S. District\n\nCourt nomination. See Tables 2 and 3 in the following pages.\n\n7 On October 5, 1999, the Senate, by 45 yeas to 54 nays, failed to confirm the nomination\n\nof Ronnie L. White to be a District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n8 Thus, the statistics in this report distinguish between the overall number of nominations\n\nonce failing to receive Senate confirmation and the smaller number of nominees who failed\n\never to be confirmed. The former number covers all instances of nominations failing\n\nconfirmation when returned pursuant to Rule XXXI, regardless of whether the nominees\n\ninvolved were later renominated and confirmed. The latter number accounts only for\n\nindividuals who failed ever to be confirmed because of unfavorable committee action,\n\nSenate rejection, the withdrawal of the nomination, or the Presidentâs disinclination to\n\nrenominate upon receiving from the Senate a returned nomination.\n\nCRS-4\n\ncommittee hearing, committee action, and confirmation or other final Senate action.\n\nNominations are listed in chronological order according to the nomination date. In\n\nthe confirmation column, a date by itself indicates that the Senate, on the date given,\n\nconfirmed the nominee by voice vote or unanimous consent. A confirmation date,\n\nwith a vote total underneath, indicates that Senate confirmation was by a roll call vote\n\nor that a specifically identified procedural matter involving the nomination was\n\ndecided by a roll call vote.9 This column also indicates the final disposition of\n\nnominations failing to receive Senate confirmation. An entry of âReturned,\n\n11/14/94,â for example, indicates that the nomination was returned to the President\n\npursuant to Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, due to the Senateâs taking a recess of\n\nmore than 30 days.\n\nNominations to the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States consists of a chief justice and eight\n\nassociate justices. As the highest appellate court in the federal judiciary, the Supreme\n\nCourt reviews decisions of lower federal courts, as well as rulings of state courts\n\nwhere a federal question is involved. The Court also has original jurisdiction (that\n\nis, it can act as a court of first resort) over cases affecting public ministers of foreign\n\nstates and in certain cases in which a state is a party.\n\nOf the Courtâs present members, two associate justices were nominated by\n\nPresident Clinton, both during the 103rd Congress. Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a\n\nmember of the Court in 1993 and Stephen G. Breyer in 1994.\n\nOn June 22, 1993, President Clinton nominated Judge Ginsburg, then a judge\n\non the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill a Supreme\n\nCourt vacancy created by the retirement of Associate Justice Byron R. White. As a\n\nSupreme Court nominee, Judge Ginsburg testified before the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee on July 20, 21, and 22, 1993, followed by one more day of hearings, on\n\nJuly 23, for witnesses testifying in support of or against the nomination.10 The\n\nJudiciary Committee, on July 29, voted unanimously to report the Ginsburg\n\nnomination favorably to the full Senate. The Senate proceeded to consideration of\n\nthe Ginsburg nomination on August 2, and confirmed the nominee on August 3 by\n\na roll call vote of 96-3.\n\n9 During the Clinton presidency, there were 59 such roll call votes, two involving\n\nnominations to the Supreme Court of the United States, 23 involving U.S. Court of Appeal\n\nnominations, and 34 involving U.S. District Court nominations. Of the 59 roll call votes,\n\n25 were cast during the 105th Congress and 28 during the 106th Congress. See Tables 1, 2,\n\nand 3 on the following pages.\n\n10 Also, on July 23, 1993, the nominee appeared in a routine closed-door session conducted\n\nby the committee to consider any questions arising out of its confidential investigation into\n\nthe nomineeâs background.\n\nCRS-5\n\nThe second occasion for President Clinton to make a Supreme Court\n\nappointment arose on April 6, 1994, when Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun\n\nannounced his retirement effective at the close of the Courtâs term then in progress.\n\nTo fill the prospective Court vacancy, President Clinton, on May 17, nominated\n\nJudge Stephen G. Breyer of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nThe nominee testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 12, 13, and 14,\n\nfollowed by one more day of hearings, on July 15, for witnesses testifying in support\n\nof or against the nomination.11 The Judiciary Committee, on July 19, voted\n\nunanimously to report the Breyer nomination favorably to the full Senate. The\n\nSenate proceeded to consider the nomination on July 29, and the same day confirmed\n\nthe nominee by a roll call vote of 87-9.\n\nSubsequent to Justice Breyerâs confirmation in 1994, no vacancies occurred on\n\nthe Court during the remainder of the Clinton presidency.\n\nTable 1.

There is also a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n\n(consisting of 12 judges), which has nationwide jurisdiction and which reviews,\n\namong other things, lower court rulings in patent, trademark, and copyright cases.12\n\n11 On July 14, 1994, the nominee also appeared in a routine closed-door session conducted\n\nby the committee to consider any questions arising out of its confidential investigation into\n\nthe nomineeâs background.\n\n12 Besides lower court rulings in patent, trademark, and copyright cases, this court reviews\n\ncertain appeals from U.S. district and territorial courts in contract, internal revenue, and\n\nother cases; decisions of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. Court of\n\nInternational Trade; and administrative rulings by the Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S.\n\nInternational Trade Commission, the Secretary of Commerce, agency boards of contract\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-6\n\nAltogether, 179 permanent circuit judgeships are authorized by law. During the\n\n103rd through the 106th Congresses, 65 of President Clintonâs 106 nominations to the\n\ncircuit courts received Senate confirmation, and all but two of the 65 appointees were\n\nserving as active circuit judges when President Clinton left office on January 20,\n\n2001.13\n\nAt the beginning of the 107th Congress, with less than three weeks left in his\n\npresidency, Mr. Clinton re-submitted nine circuit court nominations which had been\n\nsubmitted, but not confirmed, in the previous 106th Congress. On March 19, 2001,\n\nPresident George W. Bush, Mr. Clintonâs successor, withdrew the nine nominations\n\nbut then, on May 9, 2001, renominated one of the Clinton nominees, Roger L.\n\nGregory of Virginia. Mr. Gregoryâs re-submitted nomination to a Fourth Circuit\n\njudgeship was confirmed by the Senate on July 20, 2001.14\n\nUpon being transmitted by the President to the Senate, circuit court nominations\n\nare referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nDuring the 103rd Congress, 19 of President Clintonâs 22 nominees to the Courts\n\nof Appeals received Senate confirmation. Three other nominations failed to be\n\nconfirmed and were returned to the President at the sine die adjournment of the\n\nsecond session of Congress, pursuant to Rule XXXI of the Standing Rules of the\n\nSenate. Subsequently, during the 104th Congress, the names of these three nominees\n\nwere resubmitted by President Clinton and received Senate confirmation.15\n\nDuring the 104th Congress, the Senate received 20 Courts of Appeals\n\nnominations from the President. Eleven of these nominations were confirmed, one\n\nwas withdrawn by the President (at the nomineeâs request),16 and eight were returned\n\nto the President at the sine die adjournment of Congress, pursuant to Senate Rule\n\n12 (...continued)\n\nappeals, and the Merit System Protection Board.\n\n13 One Clinton appointee nominated and confirmed in 1994, Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, retired in 1996. See Neil MacFarquhar,\n\nâFederal Judge to Resign, Citing Political Attacks on Judiciary,â New York Times, June 5,\n\n1996, pp. B1, B4. Another Clinton appointee, John D. Kelly of North Dakota, received\n\nSenate confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on July 31, 1998 but\n\ndied on October 21, 1998, shortly after taking office.\n\n14 Earlier, on December 27, 2000 (between the final adjournment of the 106th Congress and\n\nthe convening of the 107th Congress), Mr. Gregory had received a recess appointment from\n\nPresident Clinton to the Fourth Circuit judgeshipâthe only one recess appointed among the\n\nnine individuals renominated to circuit judgeships at the beginning of the 107th Congress.\n\n15 While two of the three nominations were confirmed routinely during the 104th Congress,\n\nthe third was confirmed only after narrowly surviving a Senate floor vote on a motion to\n\nrecommit to the Judiciary Committee. See January 31, 1995 nomination of James L. Dennis\n\nof Louisiana, in Table 2.\n\n16 See in Table 2 the October 27, 1995 nomination of Charles R. Stack of Florida. For\n\nbackground on circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of this nomination, see Joan\n\nBiskupic, âAppeals Court Nominee Says No Thanks,â Washington Post, May 10, 1996, p.\n\nA17.\n\nCRS-7\n\nXXXI. Of the eight returned nominations, four had been reported favorably by the\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee, but failed to be considered by the full Senate; one had\n\nreceived a committee hearing, but was not reported, and three had failed to receive\n\ncommittee hearings. Subsequently, during the 105th Congress, the names of six of\n\nthese eight nominees were resubmitted by President Clinton, with four of the six then\n\nreceiving Senate confirmation.\n\nDuring the 105th Congress, President Clinton submitted 30 appeals court\n\nnominations to the Senate (including the six re-submissions noted above). Of the 30\n\nnominations, 20 were confirmed, one was withdrawn by the President,17 and nine\n\nwere returned to the President at the end of the 105th Congress, pursuant to Senate\n\nRule XXXI.. Of the nine returned nominations, two had been reported favorably by\n\nthe Judiciary Committee but failed to be considered by the full Senate, one had\n\nreceived a committee hearing but was not reported, and six had failed to receive\n\ncommittee hearings. Two of the returned nominations were re-submissions from the\n\n104th Congress. Subsequently, during the 106th Congress, the names of six of the\n\nreturned nominees were resubmitted by President Clinton, with four of the six then\n\nreceiving Senate confirmation.\n\nDuring the 106th Congress, President Clinton submitted 34 appeals court\n\nnominations to the Senate (including the six re-submissions noted above). Of the 34\n\nnominations, 15 were confirmed, one was withdrawn by the President, and 18 were\n\nreturned to the President (17 at the sine die adjournment of Congress). Sixteen of the\n\nreturned nominations failed to receive committee hearings.\n\nDuring the entire Clinton presidency, there were 23 Senate roll call votes on\n\nappeals court nominations (three during the 103rd Congress, one during the 104th\n\nCongress, seven during the 105th Congress, and 12 during the 106th Congress ).18\n\nAs of February 5, 2001, two weeks after President Clinton left office, there were\n\n29 vacant U.S. circuit judgeships.\n\nMost of the nominations listed below were made to fill judicial vacancies\n\ncreated by the death, retirement, or resignation of the previous officeholder. Some\n\nof the nominations, however, were to judgeships which had been vacant since their\n\n17 See in Table 2 the June 27, 1997 nomination of James S. Ware of California.

Hunting for a Sub,â National Law Journal, vol. 20, Nov.\n\n24, 1997, p. A4.\n\n18 The closest roll call votes were on the following nominations: a 61-37 vote on April 14,\n\n1994, confirming Rosemary Barkett of Florida; a 63-35 vote on October 4, 1994, confirming\n\nH.

Dennis of Louisiana; a 68-28 vote on October 2, 1998,\n\nconfirming Sonia Sotomayor of New York; a 57-41 vote on October 8, 1998, confirming\n\nWilliam A.

Bush on 03/19/01, Mr. Gregory was renominated\n\nby President Bush on 05/09/01 and confirmed by the Senate on 07/20/01 by a 93-1 roll call vote.\n\nCRS-14\n\nNominations to the U.S. District Courts\n\nThe U.S. District Courts are the trial courts of general federal jurisdiction. Each\n\nstate has at least one district court, while some have as many as four. There are 665\n\njudgeships authorized by law, including those for the District of Columbia, the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories of Guam, the Northern Marianas,\n\nand the Virgin Islands.19\n\nDuring his presidency, 307 of Mr. Clintonâs 382 nominations to the district\n\ncourts received Senate confirmation. All but seven of the individuals confirmed\n\ncontinued to hold office as district judges when President Clinton left on January 20,\n\n2001.20\n\nDuring the 103rd Congress, 108 of President Clintonâs 119 nominations to the\n\ndistrict courts were confirmed. Eleven of his nominations to the district courts,\n\nhaving failed to receive Senate confirmation by the end of the 103rd Congress, were\n\nreturned to the President, pursuant to Rule XXXI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n\nOf the 11 nominees not confirmed during the 103rd Congress, four eventually were\n\nconfirmed after being renominated in the 104th Congress. (Of the seven other\n\nnominees not confirmed during the 103rd Congress, one was renominated during the\n\n104th Congress, but the resubmitted nomination was later withdrawn by President\n\nClinton. The President declined to renominate the six other individuals.)\n\nDuring the 104th Congress, President Clinton submitted to the Senate 85 district\n\ncourt nominations. Of the 85 nominations; 62 were confirmed; three were withdrawn\n\nby the President; and 20 were returned to the President at the sine die adjournment\n\nof the second session of the Congress, pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI. Of the 20\n\nreturned nominations, three had been favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary\n\n19 The 665 total consists of 655 permanently authorized judgeships and 10 âtemporaryâ\n\njudgeships (which pursuant to statute temporarily increase the number of judgeships for\n\nspecified judicial districts, with these districts reverting back to the permanently authorized\n\nnumber of judgeships at a future point in time fixed by the statuteâtypically, when, after\n\na specified number of years a judgeship in the district is vacated). Nine of the judgeships\n\nwere created on November 19, 1999, upon enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations\n\nAct for FY2000, Public Law 106-113. Ten more of the judgeships were created on\n\nDecember 21, 2000, upon enactment of Public Law 106-553.\n\nAll of the 665 judgeships, except for the four district judgeships in the territorial\n\ndistrict courts, entail lifetime appointments. See discussion on pages 1 and 2 concerning\n\nlifetime appointments of judges on âArticle III courtsâ and the fixed-term appointments of\n\njudges on âlegislative courts.â\n\n20 During his presidency, the overall number of President Clintonâs appointees holding\n\ndistrict judgeships was reduced by seven due to the death on January 8, 1996, of Judge Okla\n\nJones, II, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the elevation\n\nof District Judges Frank M. Hull to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on\n\nSeptember 4, 1997, Marjorie O. Rendell to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on\n\nSeptember 26, 1997, Rosemary S. Pooler to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on\n\nJune 2, 1998, Kim McLean Wardlaw to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July\n\n31, 1998, Richard Paez to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 9, 2000, and\n\nJohnnie B. Rawlinson to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2000.\n\nCRS-15\n\nCommittee; five others had received committee hearings, and 12 failed to receive\n\nhearings. (Subsequently, during the 105th Congress, the names of 16 of these 20\n\nnominees were resubmitted, with 12 of the 16 receiving Senate confirmation.)\n\nDuring the 105th Congress, President Clinton submitted 95 district court\n\nnominations, of which 80 were confirmed, four were withdrawn by the President, and\n\n11 were returned at the end of the 105th Congress pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI. Of\n\nthe 11 returned, two had been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, three\n\nhad received a committee hearing but had not been reported, and six had failed to\n\nreach the committee hearing stage. Two of the returned nominations were re-\n\nsubmissions from the 104th Congress. (Subsequently, during the 106th Congress, the\n\nnames of seven of these 11 nominees were resubmitted, with three of the seven\n\nreceiving Senate confirmation.)\n\nDuring the 106th Congress, President Clinton submitted 83 district court\n\nnominations, including the seven re-submissions noted above. Of the 83 nominations,\n\n57 were confirmed, one was withdrawn, 24 were returned to the President at the sine\n\ndie adjournment of the Congress, and one was rejected by a Senate roll call vote.21\n\nOf the 24 returned nominations, only two received a hearing; six of the 24\n\nnominations, however, had been transmitted to the Senate relatively late during the\n\nCongress, after the August recess of the second session.\n\nDuring the entire Clinton presidency, there were 34 Senate roll call votes on\n\ndistrict court nominations, 18 cast during the 105th Congress and 16 during the 106th\n\nCongress.22\n\nAs of February 5, 2000, two weeks after President Clinton left office, there were\n\n62 vacant U.S. district judgeships.\n\nIn the table below, the phrase âNew positionâ occasionally appears in the\n\nâDistrictâ column. The phrase refers to a vacant judgeship created either by the\n\nJudicial Improvements Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 5089, 28 U.S.C. 133) or by a provision\n\n21 By 45 yeas to 54 nays, the Senate on October 5, 1999 failed to confirm the nomination of\n\nRonnie L. White to be a District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri. This was the\n\nfirst time in 12 years that a nomination to a federal judgeship had been rejected by a Senate\n\nvote. The most recent previous Senate vote rejecting a judicial nomination occurred on\n\nOctober 23, 1987, when the Senate, by 42 yeas to 58 nays, failed to confirm the Supreme\n\nCourt nomination of Robert H. Bork.\n\n22 The closest roll call votes on district court nominations were the 45-54 vote on October\n\n5, 1999, rejecting the nomination of Ronnie L. White to the U.S. District Court for the\n\nEastern District of Missouri; the 55-44 vote on September 21, 1999, failing to close debate\n\non the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to the U.S. District Court of Utah; the 56-34\n\nvote on June 22, 1998, confirming Susan Oki Mollway to the U.S. District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Hawaii; the 63-36 vote on May 24, 2000, confirming Gerard E. Lynch to the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York; the 67-30 vote on January 28, 1998,\n\nconfirming Ann L. Aiken to the U.S. District Court of Oregon; and the 67-28 vote on\n\nFebruary 11, 1998, confirming Margaret M. Morrow to the U.S. District Court for the\n\nCentral District of California.\n\nCRS-16\n\nin the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000.23 A âNew positionâ vacancy is\n\nto be distinguished from a vacancy created when a district judge died, retired, or\n\nresigned from office. Unless designated âNew position,â the nominations listed\n\nbelow were to judgeships which a predecessor held until he or she vacated the office.\n\nTable 3.

It also renders money judgments founded upon any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department or any express or implied contract with the United States. The\n\ncourt is composed of 16 judges appointed to15-year terms.25 As of mid-February\n\n2001, there were no vacant judgeships on the court.\n\nDuring his tenure in office, President Clinton nominated eight persons to this\n\ncourtâseven during the 105th Congress, and one at the beginning of the 107th\n\nCongress, less than three weeks before the end of his presidency. All seven persons\n\nnominated during the 105th Congress were confirmed. After being nominated at the\n\nstart of the 107th Congress, Sarah L. Wilson received from President Clinton a recess\n\nappointment to serve on the court until the end of the second session of the 107th\n\nCongress. President Clinton made the recess appointment on January 19, 2001, his\n\nlast full day in office, during an intra-session recess of the Senate. When President\n\nClinton left office the next day, all eight of his appointees (including his recess\n\nappointee, Ms. Wilson) were sitting on the court, with the Wilson nomination\n\npending. On March 19, 2001, the Wilson nomination was withdrawn by Mr.\n\nClintonâs successor, President George W. Bush.\n\nTwo of the persons confirmed had been nominated twice. One of them had been\n\nnominated during the 104th Congress, and had his nomination returned to the\n\nPresident at the end of that Congress (after the nomination had been referred to, but\n\nnot acted on, by the Judiciary Committee). The nomination was re-submitted at the\n\nbeginning of the 105th Congress, received a Judiciary Committee hearing and then\n\ncommittee approval near the end of the Congressâ second session, and was confirmed\n\nwhen the Senate adjourned sine die, on October 21, 1998.\n\nAnother person was nominated twice as well, but in her case both nominations\n\nwere submitted during the 105th Congress. In the period between her first and second\n\nnomination she also was appointed to the court by recess appointment. The person\n\nreceiving the appointment, Christine O. C. Miller, was, at the time, a judge on the\n\ncourt, having already been nominated to serve a second term. The recess\n\nappointment was made on December 10, 1997, immediately upon the expiration of\n\nthe judgeâs first term, with the nomination for the second term pending in the Senate.\n\nShortly after the recess appointment, the judgeâs nomination was confirmed by the\n\nSenate.26\n\n25 Until shortly before President Clinton entered office, the court was called the U.S. Claims\n\nCourt. The change to the courtâs present name was put into effect in October 1992, when\n\nCongress passed, and President George Bush signed, the Federal Courts Administration Act\n\nof 1992, 106 Stat. 4506 (1992).\n\n26 President Clinton submitted to the Senate a second nomination of Judge Miller early in\n\nthe second session of the 105th Congress, subsequent to the recess appointment, but prior to\n\nthe Senateâs February 3, 1998 confirmation of his first nomination of Judge Miller. After\n\nJudge Millerâs confirmation, the President neglected to withdraw the second nomination.\n\nUltimately this nomination was returned to the President when Congress adjourned sine die\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-33\n\nTable 5.

The court is composed of 19 judges appointed by the President for 15-year\n\nterms, with the Senateâs consent. A chief judge is elected biennially by the courtâs\n\nmembers.\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr. Clinton nominated nine persons to be judges on the\n\nU.S. Tax Court, with all nine receiving Senate confirmation. On January 20, 2001,\n\nwhen President Clinton left office, all nine of his appointees were serving as active\n\njudges on the court. Two of the individuals confirmed during the 104th Congress had\n\nbeen nominated once before, during the 103rd Congress. When the earlier\n\nnominations failed to receive Senate action by the end of that Congress, they were\n\nreturned to the President, pursuant to Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, Standing Rules of the\n\nSenate. (Hence, during the Clinton presidency, the Senate received eleven\n\nnominations to this court, nine of which were confirmed.) Three of President\n\nClintonâs nominations were reappointments of persons appointed to the court by\n\nearlier Presidents.\n\nUpon being transmitted by the President to the Senate, nominations to this court\n\nare referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nAs of mid-February 2001, two judgeships on the court were vacant.\n\nCRS-35\n\nTable 6.

The mandating act, at 102 Stat. 4114,\n\nprovides that, âNot more than the number equal to the next whole number greater than one-\n\nhalf of the number of judges of the court may be members of the same political party.â\n\nHence, on a seven-or six-member court, no more than four judges may be of the same\n\npolitical party; on a five-or four-member court, no more than three judges may be of the\n\nsame political party. During the 101st Congress (1989-1990), President George Bush\n\nnominated seven persons to the court, all of whom received Senate confirmation.\n\nCRS-37\n\nNominations to the Superior Court\n\nof the District of Columbia\n\nThe Superior Court of the District of Columbia is the trial court of local civil\n\nand criminal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia. The court consists of a chief\n\njudge and 58 associate judges. The President selects nominees to the court from a\n\nlist compiled by the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission. Each\n\njudge is appointed for a term of 15 years, subject to mandatory retirement at age 74.\n\n(The chief judge is designated by the Judicial Nomination Commission.)\n\nDuring his tenure in office, President Clinton nominated 24 individuals to the\n\nSuperior Court. Twenty-two of them received Senate confirmation, while the\n\nnominations of the other two persons were returned to the President at the sine die\n\nadjournment of the 106th Congress. All but one of the 22 confirmed Clinton\n\nappointees continued to serve on the court when President Clinton left office on\n\nJanuary 20, 2001.29\n\nTwo of the 24 individuals selected by the President to be Superior Court judges\n\nwere nominated twiceâinitially during the 104th Congress (at the end of which their\n\nnominations were returned to the President), and again at the beginning of the 105th\n\nCongress. The Senate confirmed one of the two nominees during the first session\n\nof the 105th Congress and confirmed the other at the end of the 105th Congressâ\n\nsecond session.\n\nBesides those nominated by the President, 17 Superior Court associate judges,\n\nwhose terms had expired during the Clinton presidency, were subsequently\n\nreappointed by the District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and\n\nTenure.30\n\nAs of mid-February 2001, there were two Superior Court vacancies.\n\nUpon being transmitted by the President to the Senate, nominations to this court\n\nare referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n29 Judge Eric T. Washington, one of the 22 Clinton appointees, vacated his position on the\n\nSuperior Court upon being confirmed by the Senate to the District of Columbia Court of\n\nAppeals on May 26, 1999.\n\n30 Those reappointments occurred pursuant to a federal statute, which provides that a judge\n\non the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or on the District of Columbia Court of\n\nAppeals who, not less than three months prior to the expiration of his or her term of office,\n\nfiles a âdeclaration of candidacy for reappointment,â will automatically be reappointed for\n\nanother term if the commission determines that the judge is either âexceptionally well\n\nqualified or well qualifiedâ for reappointment. 87 Stat. 796 (1973), 11 App. D.C.
