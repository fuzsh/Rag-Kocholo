        "text": "On August 12, 2015, a group of young Americans, all under the age of 21 at the time of filing, filed a lawsuit against the Department of Energy’s decision to approve the construction of a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Coos Bay, Oregon. The plaintiffs argued that the US government’s continued support for fossil fuel extraction and export, and failure to mitigate climate change, exemplified by its approval of the LNG terminal, violated their rights under the Fifth and Ninth Amendments to the US Constitution, as well as the Public Trust Doctrine. The plaintiffs asserted the government, with full knowledge of anthropogenic climate change’s existence and consequences, had injured them by failing to use its powers over federal lands and interstate commerce to prevent it.\n\nBased upon this theory, the plaintiffs stated the federal government’s failure to reduce carbon emissions harmed the atmosphere and climate system, the proper functioning of which was vital to protecting their life, liberty, and property. Furthermore, because the federal government holds the nation’s air, oceans, shoreline, and wildlife in public trust, its failure to mitigate climate change and reduce fossil fuel use violated that duty, given the effects of increased carbon dioxide emissions on the environment.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs argued their Ninth Amendment rights had been violated, asserting Americans possessed an implicit, unenumerated right to be sustained by the nation’s natural systems, including its climate. The plaintiffs asked the court to revoke the permit for the LNG terminal, declare Section 201 of the Energy Policy Act unconstitutional, and order the defendants to prepare and implement a plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to stabilize the climate system.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS) and the League of Women Voters of Oregon (LWV Oregon) filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs on September 12, 2016, arguing the plaintiffs’ claims were not non-justiciable political questions, and that the judicial branch had a duty to intervene and protect their right to a livable climate system.\n\nOn November 10, 2016, the district court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, stating, “Exercising my “reasoned judgment, […] I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society. Just as marriage is the “foundation of the family,” a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation “of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.” The court, quoting from the League's amicus brief, also rejected the defendants' assertion the case was a non-justiciable political question, declaring, \"the majority of youth plaintiffs are minors who cannot vote and must depend on others to protect their political interests.\"\n\nDefendants then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, requesting the district court be ordered to dismiss the case. LWVUS and LWV Oregon filed a second amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs on September 5, 2017, urging the court of appeals to deny the defendants’ petition. On March 7, 2018, the court of appeals denied the defendants’ motion for dismissal.\n\nSubsequently, LWVUS and LWV Oregon filed two additional amicus briefs supporting the plaintiffs as briefing on defendants' motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings progressed. On October 15, 2018, the district court partially denied defendants' motions. The government appealed again to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, a three-judge panel dismissed the case in a 2-1 vote, ruling the plaintiffs had no standing to bring the case, and that the executive and legislative branches were the proper parties to grant relief. Plaintiffs then sought en banc review by the full circuit court of appeals. LWVUS and LWV Oregon filed a fourth amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs' request, arguing their fundamental rights were being violated by the government’s failure to address climate change and that judicial intervention was needed. On February 10, 2021, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs' petition for rehearing by the full court.\n\nAfter the failure of subsequent settlement negotiations, plaintiffs then requested permission to file an amended complaint, which was granted in June 2023. The government then moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In December 2023, the district court partially granted defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing plaintiffs' claims of a right to a climate system capable of sustaining life under the Due Process Clause and violation of the Public Trust Doctrine to proceed.\n\nThe government then appealed, requesting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals order the district court to dismiss the case. The petition was granted on May 1, 2024, and the district court dismissed the case on the same day.\n\nThe League was represented in this case by Zemper Eiva Law LLC, Law Office of Andrew Welle, and Crag Law Center."
