He received a J.D. degree in 1963 from Harvard Law School and a B.A. in 1957 from St. Johnâs University. He also earned the LL.M.

OâScannlain\n\nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit\n\nThe Pioneer Courthouse\n\nGersham Goldstein, or âGershâ as we would fondly call him, was an esteemedÂ founder of our Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society. Gersh, whom I had known before I came on the Court 34 years ago and later served with on the board of Ninth Judicial Circuit Historical Society, was among the very first to assist us in conceiving of the need to preserve and to honor the history of this National Landmark and Portland icon. His organizational and fiscal expertise proved crucial to the success of this enterprise. His never-failing support and counsel, as well as his friendly and cordial demeanor, are a memorable inspiration for us all.Â My wife, Maura, joins me in extending condolences to Pauline; Gersh will be sorely missed.\n\nÂ\n\nFrom Judge Susan P. Graber\n\nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit\n\nThe Pioneer Courthouse\n\nÂ\n\nIt was my good fortune that my career intersected Gersham Goldsteinâs. We had much in common: past lives in Cincinnati, partnership at Stoel Rives, and service together on the board of the Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society.Â Gershamâs brilliance was obvious, but he never flaunted it. He was patient, helpful, courteous, and kind. Gersham also was a pillar of Oregonâs Jewish community, and he was as generous there as in the legal community.Â I will miss him.\n\nÂ Â\n\nFrom Ryan W. Bounds,\n\nPresident, Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society\n\nAssistant United States Attorney, District of Oregon\n\nÂ\n\nIt was my good fortune that my career intersected Gersham Goldsteinâs. We had much in common: past lives in Cincinnati, partnership at Stoel Rives, and service together on the board of the Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society.Â Gershamâs brilliance was obvious, but he never flaunted it. He was patient, helpful, courteous, and kind. Gersham also was a pillar of Oregonâs Jewish community, and he was as generous there as in the legal community.Â I will miss him.\n\nThe gray and rainy skies on August 6 were not so out of place as they might have seemed in an otherwise hot and sunny August. They marked the loss of one of the great lights of our organization, our community, and the bar: Gersham Goldstein. Gersham was a founding member of the Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society, a font of historicalâand invariably amusingâanecdotes, and a tireless advocate for preserving and celebrating the culture, history, and traditions of the legal profession and the Ninth Circuit. (He was also a long-serving board member of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Historical Society.)\n\nI knew Gersham my entire legal career; I expect hundreds (if not thousands) of lawyers could say the same thing, for he was an institution. He was also the best sort of lawyer and mentor. He was magnificently warm, slyly witty, deeply intellectual, and unquestionably expert in his field. What stood out most often among his many virtues, though, was his warmth. It was impossible to quibble with Gersham when you could actuallyÂ hearÂ him smiling on the other end of the line. And he was almost always smilingâeven when his health was failing and he was enduring hardships and losses that must have been profound even for a man in his 80s. Gersham was simply a wonderful and generous person. (Indeed, he and his wife Pauline were the PCHSâs most generous individual benefactors.) He will be sorely missed but gratefully remembered by a multitude of admirers, including all those of us who were honored to serve with him on the PCHS Board."
