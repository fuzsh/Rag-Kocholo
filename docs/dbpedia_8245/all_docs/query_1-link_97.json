        "text": "When Jake Lee asked his kindergarten students at Scouters Mountain Elementary about ways they could spread kindness throughout local neighborhoods, all 24 of his enthusiastic five- and six-year-olds immediately signed up. And by “signing up,” that meant putting motivational signs up at landmarks all over the Scouters Mountain and Happy Valley area, including walking trails, parks, and even the local library. See how the kindness is spreading beyond the classroom and throughout the community.\n\nRead More about NCSD News • Episode 13 • KINDERGARTEN SIGNS UP TO SPREAD KINDNESS\n\nWhy did three enthusiastic team members from the Clackamas Trader Joe’s recently pay a very special visit to a Mt.

Spring Mountain Elementary’s Midnight Tigers are a gifted group of five fabulous fifth graders who recently outperformed schools from all across the region in the fast-paced question-and-answer reading comprehension challenge, advancing all the way to the state finals!

As you’ll hear, this was certainly not “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off!” Students from Milwaukie, Rex Putnam, Clackamas, Adrienne C. Nelson, Clackamas Web Academy, Clackamas Middle College, and the Virtual Online Program spent hours learning about potential careers, building their resumes, and participating in mock job interviews.\n\nEpisode 41 - Field Trip Day For NCSD Juniors\n\nRead More about Episode 41 - Field Trip Day For NCSD Juniors\n\nSince launching nearly two years ago, we've featured some very special guests…from NCSD’s Superintendent to extraordinary teachers and students who have captivated us with amazing stories from their school communities.

NCSD school counselors are always there to make sure ALL students feel seen, supported, and most importantly, celebrated for who they are. In this episode, it’s a conversation full of compassion as we’re joined by a school counselor from each level: Clackamas High School’s Laura Nelson, Alder Creek Middle School’s Stephanie Atkinson, and Scouters Mountain Elementary’s Jessica Winfrey.

These high-achieving high schoolers have been a part of the district’s Dual Language Immersion (DLI) program since elementary school, meaning they’ve spent parts of their days learning in English…and the other parts 100% in Spanish. This week, meet seniors Sebastian Castillo-Graduno and Leslie Osorio Martinez, along with sophomore Dahlia Sanchez Martinez, who share how growing up in NCSD’s DLI program has not only helped them develop bilingual skills, but also develop lifelong friendships that even resulted in the formation of a successful local band!\n\nEpisode 37 - Our DLI Program Hits The High Notes\n\nRead More about Episode 37 - Our DLI Program Hits The High Notes"
