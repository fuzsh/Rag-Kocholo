Morse United States Courthouse in Eugene. Held on October 18, 2019, 156 first-year students got their first introduction to the realities of practicing law from those on the federal bench, law firm partners, and government attorneys focused on both civil and criminal practice.\n\nThe annual event was conceived in part by U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken, who graduated from Oregon Law in 1979. It began in an effort to inspire law students and new lawyers to think courageously and creatively about their future careers.\n\n“Whatever job you want to do in the law is going to be hard,” said Judge Aiken to students. “Find the people who have your back, who share your values and are going to support you when the times are down. It could be a big firm, a small firm or a collaboration where you are sharing office space. Most importantly, work with people that care about you and the work you are going to do.”"
