        "text": "The media was not quick to embrace Black creatives nor has Juneteenth long been something on its radar. (Historically, as Black artists have entered television, the discussion of Black holidays has tended to be nonexistent, with only the occasional look at Kwanzaa thrown in around December.) But as different voices enter the culturally and politically shifting landscape, the newly recognized federal holiday — which honors the emancipation of the last enslaved people here in the United States on June 19 — could, or at the very least should, pop up more on screens large and small.\n\nChanning Godfrey Peoples made her directorial debut against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 with “Miss Juneteenth“: a feature film starring Nicole Beharie and Alexis Chikaeze as a mother-daughter pair navigating their opposing dreams for the young girl’s future. Before that, “Juneteenth” was the title of Season 1, Episode 9 in Donald Glover’s beloved “Atlanta”: a boundary-breaking FX dramedy about Blackness and celebrity with a surrealist twist.\n\nFrom tentpoles that changed the box-office game (see “Get Out” and “Black Panther”) to smaller indie achievements (“Fruitvale Station,” “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” and yes, “Moonlight”), not all of the picks that appear in the following list of recommendations have Juneteenth-centric stories or themes, per se. However, all of them honor and revere Black actors and other creatives, as well as tell stories that are heartwarming, powerful, emotionally resonant, and interesting to revisit for Juneteenth 2023. All entires are listed chronologically by release year; alphabetically therein.\n\nWith editorial contribution by Wilson Chapman, Jacqueline Coley, Jude Dry, Kristen Lopez, Leonardo Adrian Garcia, Jenna Marotta, Wilson Morales, Noel Murray, Anne Thompson, and Ben Travers."
