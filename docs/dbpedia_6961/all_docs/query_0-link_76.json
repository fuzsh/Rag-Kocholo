        "text": "Sign up for the daily newsletter, Jay's Plays of the Day, to get sports betting recommendations for the top games of the night and the week ahead.\n\nWeekend winners\n\nThe Titans. Sure, there is football out there amid all the medal counts and vote counters. And Tennessee reportedly has added a late addition in three-time Pro Bowl safety Quandre Diggs. It's a savvy move for a team that is going to have to find ways to win games 21-17.\n\nMichael Phelps. He has been everywhere on these Games — and we will have our Olympic thoughts in a moment — but in an event filled with GOATs, it's important to remember that as Phelps swims faux laps with Snoop, he has more Olympic Gold medals than 162 countries. Think about that.\n\nThe 5-at-10 discourse. You guys have been crushing it in the comments, and Friday's exchange about the prisoner swap was equal parts balanced, intelligent and congenial. We may not agree, but I am pleased here we can choose to agree to disagree, you know?\n\nNFL Hall of Fame inductees. That's cool.\n\nWeekend losers\n\nNFL Hall of Fame process. There are too many holes and too many folks waiting unnecessarily. And hopefully they will get a Golden Jacket before they croak.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox. Wow, losing 20 straight games is soothing, friends.\n\nAmerican voters. Right when a legitimate third-party candidate could be helpful, RFK Jr. shares a story of dumping a dead bear in Central Park. Why do I feel like the candidates to be 1992 pledge chairman at Auburn's Beta house were better choices than what we have?\n\nThe Lookouts. This is not about the decision or the people. Mother Nature is unbeaten after all. But we went to used car night Saturday, and the place was full. But after all the rain lately, a late Saturday afternoon thunderstorm flooded right field and forced the Lookouts to cancel a packed house and play a triple header on Sunday.\n\nOld rock band memories. After the Lookouts got bagged, we walked down to Riverfront Nights for Drivin' and Cryin' by the river. At one point D-n-C was huge. Saturday, they made me feel old. And sad. Or dare I say Honeysuckle Blue, oh, uh oh.\n\nMy picks. Yep, a bagel-for-2 Friday left us with a six-game slide to end the week. We are now below the plus-80 mark for the first time in almost a year. Where's my Co-Cola? And my ATM card?\n\nGolden moments\n\nSo we have been recalling the best Olympic moments in this space. Let's continue that; we have to start with ...\n\n— Noah Lyles is amazing. And the photo finish that ended the men's 100 meters only added to the drama. Wow.\n\n— The Olympic boxing controversy continues to simmer, although it appears the boxers in question here were born female by all reports I have seen.\n\n— Simone Biles actually lost an event. It's OK, the GOAT is back at it tonight. Anyone else think Simone gets as much camera time this side of Snoop and Tirico?\n\n— The Afghan sprinter sending a message to the Taliban over the weekend made me thankful for our freedom. She finished last but crossed the finish line with the words \"Education. Sport. Our rights.\" On her jersey. God bless sports.\n\n— Scottie Scheffler was the man on the back nine. The Masters and Olympic Gold.\n\n— The pole vaulter who failed will be a meme forever.\n\nThis and that\n\n— Thought this was very enlightening from Vince Vaughn. The actor, who said Hollywood execs no longer will make R-rated comedies because \"they do not want to get fired,\" was spot on.\n\n— Here's a Sunday column from the 5-at-10's more professional self on the USGA bringing the Senior Am to The Honors.\n\n— Rules are rules. Here's Paschall with a UT story, and friends, Boo Carter has a real chance to be THAT guy.\n\n— Headlines that matter: Cardi B and Offset are in a child custody dispute. The questions from that sentence are endless.\n\n— Rest easy, Moses Freeman. Thanks for your service.\n\nToday's questions\n\nWeekend winners and losers, go.\n\nMultiple choice Monday will go this way: What Olympic event would you want to win?\n\nAs for today, Aug. 5, let's review.\n\n\"American Bandstand\" debuted on this day in 1966.\n\nRushmore of music-based TV shows. Go."
