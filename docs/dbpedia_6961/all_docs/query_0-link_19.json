        "text": "John Smith’s short film The Black Tower (24 minutes, 16mm, 1987) features a somewhat menacing black tower that has appeared—or is now apparent—to the film’s unnamed narrator (voiced by Smith). [The Black Tower is viewable in full on YouTube.]\n\nNik Houghton summarizes the film’s premise: \"In The Black Tower we enter the world of a man haunted by a tower which, he believes, is following him around London. While the character of the central protagonist is indicated only by a narrative voice-over which takes us from unease to breakdown to mysterious death, the images, meticulously controlled and articulated, deliver a series of colour coded puzzles, jokes and puns which pull the viewer into a mind-teasing engagement.”\n\nThe film’s narrator initially, almost casually introduces the tower as “it”:\n\nI first noticed it in Spring last year. […] It was from [my home] that I first saw it—its crest protruding over the roofs on the other side of the road. Surprised that I hadn’t noticed it before, I wondered what it was and then forgot about it for several weeks.\n\nThe tower, seemingly a black void behind a row of homes, will be presented throughout the film at a variety of distances and vantage points. The precise location of the tower will become an issue for the film’s narrator, but early on, we are placed near Leytonstone, London.\n\nWaiting to turn into a Crownfield Road, I saw the tower through the gap between two blocks of flats. It seemed very close. As far as I could remember the road I'd first spotted it from was nearly a mile away. I didn't have time to stop and work out with geography, but that evening I mentioned the tower to my next-door neighbors, as I wondered what it was used for. She said that she had never seen it.\n\nOur narrator soon begins to see the tower, or duplicates of it, around the city:\n\nWaiting outside for the bus home I noticed the familiar structure inside the prison walls. I decided that it was some kind of water tower but I was surprised that the design was the same as the one near my home. I was even more surprised when the bus stopped outside a factory and I noticed another identical building inside its grounds.\n\nSoon, he decides to proceed more methodically:\n\nThe tower was still on my mind, so after breakfast, I went out take a closer look at it and find out exactly what it was used for. When I got to the place where I first spotted it, it was nowhere to be seen. I walked back along the road nearer to the front gardens. I even stood on the garden walls, but I still couldn't see anything over the rooftops. I walked the surrounding streets in case I'd taken the wrong turning, but there was still no sign of the tower. I went back to Crownfield Road and I couldn't see it from there either so I went into the news agents on the other side of the street and asked the man there what had happened to the tower. To my great relief, he told me it had been demolished previous week. I bought the local paper and left the shop.\n\nBut in a bit of conversational misprision, it turns out that a different tower has been destroyed.\n\nStill beset by the possibility of the black tower around every corner, our narrator contemplates how to proceed: “I stared at the space where the black tower had been trying to collect my thoughts.”\n\nHe eventually goes on:\n\nOutside St. Mary's Church I bent down to retie [my shoe] and looking up from the pavement again, I saw the tower behind the church roof. I panicked and started running, but when I got to the end of the street, the tower was there waiting for me. I turned the corner and saw it again. I kept running, taking different turnings, but whenever I looked up, I saw the tower. Whichever way I ran, it was always in front of me.\n\nFinally, the narrator arrives home, but changed:\n\nI got home and collapsed onto the bed, but when I closed my eyes I saw the black walls of the tower staring back at me. They got darker and darker and the mass of the tower seemed pressed against my forehead forced the back of my head into the pillow. […] Eventually, the light faded and I fell into a deep dreamless sleep. I awoke feeling strangely calm. I cooked myself a fried breakfast and started to take stock of my situation. It seemed as though I would have to stay at home from now on as there was little doubt that I would encounter the tower again if I went out. I resigned myself to my fate. […] I started to lose track of time and spent months sitting at my desk staring out of the window, always downwards in case the familiar shape appeared over the rooftops.\n\nHere the film features an interlude, focused on views from our protagonist’s window. Then, almost abruptly:\n\nI don't know who called the ambulance, but I was glad when it arrived. At first, I thought it was the ice-cream van and wonder why it was playing a different tune. When we arrived at the hospital, I was not surprised by the architecture. My recovery took several months but the doctors were sympathetic, and for the first time I was able to talk about the tower in detail without feeling that my audience would like to change the subject. As the weeks went by, my obsession diminished and by the time I was discharged, it had become clear to me that the tower had only existed in my mind.\n\nMany of Smith’s films build on what he calls “accidents,” originating from locations and images near him. As he put it in an interview [at right] about The Black Tower:\n\nI moved to a new area of East London in the early 1980s and I could see this building from my bedroom window and apart from the fact that it was a rather bizarre structure, I also got really interested in it aesthetically because the top part of the tower was painted with such an unreflective black paint that especially on a sunny day it looked like a hole cut out of the sky. So, I was really interested on an abstract level with this idea of like an absence of image on top of a plinth.\n\nFor an excellent overview of Smith’s methods in The Black Tower, see Kathrin Meyer’s “John Smith’s The Black Tower: Close-Up Views of What Cannot Be Shown” (2013).\n\nThe black tower itself was a real structure on the grounds of the Langthorne Hospital, torn down in the late 1980s. The general area, in which most of The Black Tower was filmed:\n\nIan Walker, in the exhaustive “Revising The Black Tower” (2010) has pinpointed the framing of most of the shots in the Black Tower, including its relative position to Smith’s home at the time.\n\nSmith described the filming of The Black Tower to Stuart Comer in “Funny Games: An Interview with John Smith” (Artforum, May 2011):\n\nI filmed the tower from as many different positions as I could, and I framed it so that it appeared as though it were in a different place in each of the shots. So, for example, it’s actually in the city, but at one time I see it over some trees, and I frame it so the only other thing you can see around it is trees—suggesting that the tower has gone to the country. I constructed a narrative around the places that these images suggested: One image showed the tower next to a hospital, so I knew my protagonist would get sick. Another showed it behind a high wall, so I decided he would visit a prison. Another showed it looming over a graveyard, so I knew that he had to die. The narrative is a deliberate pastiche of a supernatural short story; the specific details were not important to me. I was more interested in the power of stories generally, how stories can determine the reading of images and how they can transport us to imaginary places.\n\nIn an interview with Tom Harradd, “Interview with John Smith,” The White Review, March 2014), Smith noted that:\n\none of the reasons for making the film was to do with what the tower looked like in certain lighting conditions. The tower in question is, or was, actually a large, metal water tank that looked a bit like a garden shed on the top of a brick column, this strange, enormous structure. The garden shed bit was painted in completely non-reflective black paint so, especially in a sunny day, you really couldn’t see any detail in the black, or where the black roof joined the black walls, or where the walls joined each other. So often the top, black part of the tower just looked like a hole cut out of the sky, an absence. It’s like the empty plinth in Trafalgar square. I was fascinated by this column supporting this black polyhedron, and when you looked at it from different angles the configuration of the sides changed, but it remained looking like a flat, black hole, of different, multi-faceted shapes – so that was the initial reason for doing it, because I was curious about the way something looked. That’s very often the impetus for making films. Other ideas come in later, but it starts with noticing something unusual."
