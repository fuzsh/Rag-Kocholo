        "text": "Background[]\n\nNickelodeon Movies is the motion picture production arm of American children's cable network Nickelodeon, founded on February 25, 1995. In 1993, Nickelodeon made a deal with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) to produce films based on their properties such as their original Nicktoons, but no movies were made under this deal due to the Nick/TCF contract expiring later in 1995. Nickelodeon Movies was established to produce movies based on their shows, as well as other original family films. Their first film was Harriet the Spy, released in 1996.\n\nAll of their theatrical releases are distributed by Paramount Pictures (straight-to-streaming films have been distributed by Netflix (with the most recent one being Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie) and Paramount+ (with the most recent one being Monster High 2)), as when Nickelodeon Movies was founded, its parent company Viacom (now Paramount Global) had merged with Paramount Communications.\n\n1st Logo (Harriet the Spy custom variant) (July 10, 1996)[]\n\nVisuals: A blue rhino is shown running on what appears to be clouds (in a send-up of the first TriStar Pictures logo), as the camera slowly brightens. However, he repeatedly bumps, slips, and crashes into the \"clouds\" in the logo, which turns out to be cardboard cutouts with lights on a movie set. The rhino trips over the cloud-shaped Nickelodeon logo, and crashes into the screen. The rhino pulls himself off the screen and hangs onto the Nickelodeon cloud on a black background, causing the cloud to turn into the familiar splat design. The rhino swings a bit on it and then smiles at the screen.\n\nVariant: On 4:3 fullscreen prints, the logo is both choppier and in open matte.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation and 3D visual effects in a style called \"Blendo\". This logo was produced by Colossal Pictures in San Francisco on Macintosh and Silicon Graphics computers with Softimage Toonz, PowerAnimator, Photoshop (clouds and texture maps) and Flame (compositing) software.\n\nAudio: Dramatic orchestral music that starts getting messed up as the rhino trips, along with yelping from the rhino (possibly voiced by Jim Cummings) as he bumps and stumbles around the set. The music builds up as the rhino crashes into the screen, segueing into a hip-hop-style vocal version of the Nickelodeon jingle.\n\nAvailability: Seen only on the company's first film Harriet the Spy (1996).\n\n2nd Logo (Good Burger custom variant) (July 25, 1997)[]\n\nVisuals: On a black/blue gradient background, we see some orange soda being dispensed into a large cup. When it is done pouring, a lid with a straw closes the top, and the cup drives around the screen like a racecar until it brakes and falls. The lid comes off, and the soda spills out, with the Nickelodeon wordmark on it.\n\nTrivia: This logo pays homage to a Nickelodeon Productions logo from 1996, the year before this logo was used.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn fullscreen prints, the logo is choppier.\n\nOn 35mm film scan prints, the logo is in open-matte.\n\nOn the trailer, the Paramount Pictures logo stretches into a still alternate render of this logo.\n\nOn TV spots, as well as the film's making-of special, \"MOVIES\" is seen below in the same font as \"NICKELODEON\".\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: Soda pouring and car sounds. The brake sounds are accompanied by the acapella jingle from the 1985 \"Nick Nick Nick\" ID (as sung by the Jive Five).\n\nAvailability: Only seen on Good Burger (1997).\n\n3rd Logo (The Rugrats Movie custom trailer variant) (1997)[]\n\nVisuals: On a white background, an orange movie camera with the Nickelodeon wordmark is shown, with a green filmstrip reading \"MOVIES\" unfolding from one of the reels.\n\nTechnique: None.\n\nAudio: The opening theme/voiceover of the trailer.\n\nAvailability: This logo was made specifically for the first trailer for The Rugrats Movie (1998). However, it was used as a print logo from the company's inception until the premiere of the 5th logo.\n\n4th Logo (The Rugrats Movie custom variant) (November 20, 1998)[]\n\nVisuals: We see Slap T. Pooch (a character from the short, \"What is Funny?\", which was aired on Oh Yeah! Cartoons in that year) walk in out of nowhere on a black background, as he spots a blob of orange goo. It then goes to a really close zoom on his face and hand as he starts fidgeting with it. It then gets stuck to his fingers and he struggles to throw it off. Once it does, it starts bouncing off the walls and then gets stuck to his foot. He then jumps around to remove it, making more orange spots on the ground. A shadow then appears over Slap, then a giant purple monster foot stomps on Slap and the goo, turning the latter into the Nickelodeon footprint as seen on the gates to the Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California that was used from 1998 up until 2010. The camera pans to reveal it, then Slap falls off of it.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe way the giant foot smashes Slap is a possible shout-out to Monty Python's Flying Circus, where sketches would often abruptly end by something like a giant foot or a weight coming down from the sky and crushing whatever was on the screen (for example, the giant foot is what ends the show's intro).\n\nThe logo was creative directed by George Evelyn, and animated by Chuck Gammage Animation based on a character (from the Oh Yeah! Cartoons pilot of the same name) created by Bill Burnett and designed by Vincent Waller.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn trailers, a blue oval reading \"MOVIES\" in the Arial Narrow font accompanies the footprint.\n\nOn fullscreen prints, the logo is choppier.\n\nOn 35mm film scan prints, the logo is in open-matte.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation produced by Colossal Pictures and outsourced to Chuck Gammage Animation.\n\nAudio: A cartoon soundtrack possibly by Mark Mothersbaugh accompanied by cartoon sound effects and music cues, culminating in a hip-hop version of the Nickelodeon theme accompanied with a tuba \"wah-wah\" sound effect. The drum sample used is from \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on The Rugrats Movie (1998) and its adaptation for the Game Boy. It also appeared on trailers for Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, although the film itself used the 5th logo.\n\n5th Logo (February 11, 2000-March 29, 2002)[]\n\nVisuals: Depending on the movie:\n\nSnow Day: A man shovels the snow off the walk to his house and his dog is watching him, sitting down on the snow. Then, a giant snowball falls onto his house and completely destroys it in a very graphic manner. The dog runs off barking in a panic and the man does a double take. The snow falls off the snowball revealing a large orange ball with the Nickelodeon wordmark on it. The background turns black and the ball then bounces to the middle-left of the screen, with a small orange ball and a blue ball with \"movies\" on it following, and then it fades out.\n\nRugrats in Paris: The Movie: It is nearly the same as the Snow Day version, except the regular man is replaced with a French man raking leaves in front of his house in the fall, and the Eiffel Tower is seen in the distance. A giant orange ball with the Nickelodeon wordmark smashes his house, and the logo continues like usual, and the live-action dog appears on the bottom-right of the screen, barking at the logo as it fades out.\n\nJimmy Neutron: Boy Genius: We start with the orange Nickelodeon ball bouncing to the middle-left of the screen alongside the smaller orange ball. Then Goddard runs into screen with a synthesised bark. He looks at the logo and whimpers, knowing it's incomplete. He activates a laser beam on his back and creates the blue \"movies\" ball (with \"movies\" in a noticeably different font than the previous two variants). He puts away the laser and curiously looks at the audience. This variant was also used in the TV special The Making of Jimmy Neutron albeit shortened.\n\nClockspotters: The logo swings like a pendlim until the credits start.\n\nVariant: On the ID versions of the first two, the logo plays as normal, but the \"movies\" ball is removed.\n\nTechnique: Live-action with overlaid miniatures and computer animation, produced by Curious Pictures. The Jimmy Neutron variant uses CGI animation, produced by DNA Productions and O Entertainment.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe Snow Day (2000) version has a light whistling tune that abruptly stops when the house gets destroyed by the snowball, and then changes to either a tuba/whistling version of the Nickelodeon theme (in theaters, on VHS and in the ID variant), or a short rock tune with a choir singing at one point (on DVD, digital prints and TV airings).\n\nThe Rugrats in Paris (2000) version has an accordion playing the light whistling tune, followed by an accordion/tuba version of the Nickelodeon theme and the dog's \"bark\".\n\nThe Jimmy Neutron (2001) version has a funny sounding version of the Nickelodeon theme with a trombone, cartoonish sound effects, and Goddard's noises, provided by Frank Welker.\n\nThe Making of Jimmy Neutron (2001) variant has John Debney's music playing over it.\n\nThe Clockstoppers (2002) variant has some ticking sounds.\n\nAvailability: Seen on the titles listed above, with each movie having their respective variants of the logo. The first two versions were also modified as IDs for Nickelodeon to help promote the respective movies.\n\n6th Logo (June 28, 2002-June 13, 2003)[]\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a faint, black crescent sphere (representing the moon) moves downwards to reveal a crescent Earth, the sun, and a moving starfield (parodying the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey). As the moon moves off-screen, the Earth starts to wiggle and \"sneezes\", crashing into the camera. This causes the moon to bounce back onto the screen, revealing itself to be an orange ball with the Nickelodeon wordmark on it. The starfield also becomes to a plain black background as the Earth becomes a spinning blue ball with \"movies\" on it, and the sun becomes a smaller orange ball. The small ball flies around the screen before stopping in between the bigger balls. The blue ball then \"sneezes\" again, causing the orange balls to briefly pop out. The blue ball then straightens itself out.\n\nVariants:\n\nA shorter version of the logo starts with the balls zooming out from the middle of the screen. Theme 1 is used and it starts off a bit delayed and as a result, part of the logo at the beginning is silent.\n\nOn Rugrats Go Wild, the logo is slightly darker and cuts to black instead of fading out.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio:\n\nTheme 1: A dramatic four-note synth fanfare somewhat reminiscent of Richard Strauss' \"Also sprach Zarathustra\", the opening theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey. During the last part of the fanfare, we hear a loud sneeze, followed by a hip-hop version of the Nickelodeon theme.\n\nTheme 2: Space ambience with a piano note that repeats, followed by a different-sounding sneeze and an electro version of the Nickelodeon theme.\n\nAvailability: The long version is seen only on Hey Arnold! The Movie (2002) (with Theme 1) and Rugrats Go Wild (2003) (with Theme 2). The short version appeared during Nickelodeon's airings of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie between 2006 and 2013, despite the fact that the movie never used this logo at all originally, the movie itself used the eighth logo. It made a surprise reappearance on a June 5, 2023 airing of the movie on Nicktoons.\n\n7th Logo (The Wild Thornberrys Movie custom variant) (December 20, 2002)[]\n\nVisuals: We see a forest on a sunny day as if it was seen in the grass. Then, the curious nose of a white dog with brown splotches appears sniffing the screen. Then the dog sees the Nickelodeon Movies logo made of frisbees on the grass. We cut back to the dog, who licks the screen, turning it black.\n\nVariants:\n\nThis was also used as a network ID, but with a few differences; the blue \"movies\" ball and the small orange ball are removed. The Nickelodeon ball is moved to the middle.\n\nAn open-matte version of this logo exists on full-screen prints of The Wild Thornberrys Movie. Early full-screen prints have this logo cropped to 4:3.\n\nTechnique: A mix of stop-motion and computer animation created by Charged and 2/8/0-Design, both in New York City.\n\nAudio: Before the dog appears, we hear a guitar tune over the sounds of children playing, followed by sniffing and grunting sounds from the dog. When the company logo appears, we hear a \"country\" version of the famous Nickelodeon theme. Composed by ShackedUpSound.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on The Wild Thornberrys Movie (2002). It was also seen on a TV spot for Yours, Mine & Ours (2005) and was used as an ID in December 2002 and January 2003 to help promote the former film.\n\n8th Logo (The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie custom variant) (October 27-November 19, 2004)[]\n\nVisuals: On a black background, an explosion occurs. A blue-coloured ball emerges from the explosion as several yellow streaks form in it. We zoom through the ball as the background fades to a kaleidoscopic sky. An orange rose grows, and dissipates into petals as an orange zeppelin flies through it. The sky background ripples before fading into a kaleidoscopic view of several fish swimming. The logo then transforms into an orange bubble, which floats outward and spawns two more bubbles that form the Nickelodeon Movies logo. The finished product is in an orange underwater environment.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Transcription: In a logo, a blue ball bursts out of an explosion surrounded by bright streaks. A zeppelin floats through an orange flower breaking it apart. Goldfish swim by and bubbles form in a colorful kaleidoscope. Words appear in the bubbles. Nickelodeon Movies.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe blue ball seen at the beginning of the logo is a possible callback to the \"silver ball\" logo that Nickelodeon used from 1981 to 1984.\n\nThe zeppelin is possibly a reference to the Nickelodeon blimp used for the Kids Choice Awards, while the kaleidoscope is a possible reference to the inside of the Nickelodeon blimp.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a shortened version that starts when the logo forms.\n\nOn 35mm film scan prints of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, the logo is in open-matte.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Brand New School (who also created Cartoon Network's 2010 rebrand).\n\nAudio: A bouncy, Beatles-like tune with sound effects including explosions and ripples, ending with underwater sounds when the Nickelodeon bubbles appear. This was composed by an indie rock group called Something for Rockets (consisting of Rami Perlman, Josh Eichenbaum, and Barry Davis).\n\nAudio Variant: On the shortened version, some bubble noises are heard.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), as well as its video game counterpart for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, PC and Xbox. It was also featured on the video game counterpart for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and the teaser trailer and video game counterpart for Barnyard.\n\n9th Logo (December 17, 2004-January 12, 2007)[]\n\nVisuals: On a space background, we see a blue-tinted, Saturn-like planet with a shadow of the Nickelodeon wordmark on it. The camera moves away from the planet as a (somewhat rounded) 3D Nickelodeon wordmark zooms out from the bottom of the screen as the camera pans to reveal an orange moon (which resembles Venus), which the wordmark settles in front of. As this happens, two smaller blue and orange moons spin around and stop on the right side of it to form the Nickelodeon Movies logo. The word \"movies\" (set in Twentieth Century) spins in around the blue moon (a la the Universal logo) to complete the logo, and the camera pans down to start the movie.\n\nTrivia: The nebula seen in the background is known as the \"Eagle Nebula\" in the constellation Serpens.\n\nVariant: There is a shortened variant on Yours, Mine & Ours (2005) that starts when the Nickelodeon wordmark settles in front of the orange moon, and the logo does not pan down.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the movie or none.\n\nAvailability: Can be seen on Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), Mad Hot Ballroom (2005), Barnyard (2006), Charlotte's Web (2006), Werefoxes: The Movie (2007), and Yours, Mine & Ours (2005). It was also seen on the Hotel for Dogs game on Wii and Nintendo DS.\n\n10th Logo (Nacho Libre custom variant) (June 16, 2006)[]\n\nVisuals: We begin by zooming across a long brown oblong shape. As the rest of the screen is gradually lit up, it's revealed that it's one of the ropes of a wrestling ring. The background shows an audience rapidly taking photographs. The camera zooms down to the bottom rope once it reaches the end of the previous one and zooms past it in a similar manner. After this, the camera takes a 180 degree turn to reveal the bottom of the ring, where we see the Nickelodeon Movies circle logo as a boxing bell. The \"NICKELODEON\" ball is the bell, the \"movies\" ball is the clanger, and the dot is the screw keeping the clanger in place, all in their usual colours (with the rest of the bell being gray). The bell rings twice and the logo fades out.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the trailer, the logo is on a black background, the colors are altered, and the bell rings three times.\n\nOn 4:3 fullscreen prints, the logo is choppier.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: Sounds of a cheering audience and cameras going off (which actually start over the Paramount Pictures logo), page turning-like sounds for the zooming of the ropes (quieter on the second rope), a swoosh for zooming to the lower rope and to the back of the ring, and the bell clanging. The sounds were provided by Musikvergnuegen.\n\nAvailability: This was a custom variant used for Nacho Libre (2006) and as such, only appeared on said movie.\n\n11th Logo (February 14, 2008-June 12, 2009, August 2, 2023-present)[]\n\nVisuals: Against a black background, some orange fluid-like slime swirls out from a distance toward the viewer. The camera pans around and the slime forms the Nickelodeon logo with \"movies\" flying out letter-by-letter on its right.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis was the last Nickelodeon Movies logo to utilise Nick's long-lived splat logo, and one of only three that did overall (with the first two logos being the other two).\n\nSimilarly, the logo's 2023 return marks the return of the 1984-2009 splat, which had been left behind for years in favour of the 2009 logo. The 2023 splat used elsewhere, while redesigned, is another clear nod to its heritage.\n\nVariant: A still version of the logo appears at the end of PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie and the theatrical print of Under the Boardwalk.\n\nTechnique: A combination of CGI animation and live-action liquid photography by Picturemill (who also animated the 2020 20th Century Studios logo and the 1997 Universal Pictures logo, among others).\n\nAudio: No music,just the sounds of the slime.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOccasionally, the opening theme plays over the logo, sometimes with the slime sounds intact.\n\nSometimes, it's silent.\n\nThere is a variant that uses slime sounds and a quirky orchestral tune, ending with a majestic finish (which sounds similar to the first six notes of the Nickelodeon jingle), created by Musikvergnuegen. This version seems to have never appeared in any movies or video games, but it can be heard online.\n\nAvailability:\n\nDuring its original usage, it was seen on The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008), Hotel for Dogs (2009) (the Wii video game uses the 9th logo), Imagine That (2009), and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.\n\nWhen revived in 2023, it appeared on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (as a custom variant), PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie (international prints only), and Under the Boardwalk (theatrical prints only, the home release uses the Paramount Animation logo instead). It also appears on the trailers for the latter two.\n\n12th Logo (February 21, 2010-March 15, 2019, September 29, 2023)[]\n\nVisuals: We zoom out under an orange drop facing the camera, which is falling down against a white background. As the camera pans out and rotates so that the orange drop is viewed from a side perspective, the orange drop falls off-screen, and shortly afterwards splashes on top of something, which the camera reveals to be the \"i\" in the current Nickelodeon logo. The orange drop splashes on the \"i\" upon impact, with the splash quickly forming the dot. As the camera zooms out to fully reveal the finished logo, \"MOVIES\" in a purple Gotham font fades in, followed by a small \"TM\" trademark bug fading in to the right of the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn earlier version of the logo, used in 2010, has the Nickelodeon logo zooming out on a black background, followed by \"MOVIES\" in purple appearing letter-by-letter as some purple rays shine behind them.\n\nA variant was used on Nickelodeon airings of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. On a white background, the camera pans down to reveal the Nickelodeon logo and the word \"MOVIES\" in green. This was only used when Nickelodeon used their last-scene-of-the-show credits from 2013 until sometime in 2016, as now most current airings have no logos at all. But it did come back one more time when Nick aired the movie on February 21, 2017, seven years after the logo debuted.\n\nThere's also a slightly longer version of the above variant, where it begins with the Nickelodeon logo to fall down on the ground and the word \"MOVIES\" is in a red colour.\n\nA short version exists, which starts with the logo already being in place.\n\nOn the video game version of The Last Airbender for Nintendo DS, the logo is still and in print form.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Devastudios (who also animated the 2011 Paramount logo, the 2021 Warner Bros. Pictures logo, and the 2005 and 2013 Lionsgate Films logos), with Kelly Carlton as creative director. None for the still print version.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAudio Variant: On the video game version of The Last Airbender for Wii, the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions theme is used.\n\nAvailability: Seen on all movies produced by the company from 2010-19, starting with The Last Airbender (2010) and ending with Wonder Park (2019) (the next logo is on two trailers though).\n\nIt was first seen on the Nick@Nite promo for Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.\n\nIt was also seen on trailers for Dora and the Lost City of Gold and Playing with Fire, with the films themselves using the next logo.\n\nThis logo was last seen on the trailers of The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, but it later made a surprise appearance on a DVD version of the 2021 KCAs' TV spot of PAW Patrol: The Movie, while the films themselves use the 14th logo.\n\nDespite the logo ending its usage in 2019, this strangely enough made a surprise appearance on Dora and the Fantastical Creatures, a short film which preceded PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie in theaters (the film itself uses the previous logo).\n\n13th Logo (July 9, 2018-November 8, 2019)[]\n\nVisuals: On a white background, we see the current Nickelodeon logo from multiple angles appearing letter-by-letter in different ways (somewhat similarly to the 2017 Nickelodeon Productions logo). We cut to the finished logo, then the orange word \"MOVIES\" in Galano Grotesque (the font used for the then-current Nickelodeon branding) appears, making the letters in the Nickelodeon logo bounce for a second before settling back in their positions. The entire logo slowly zooms out before fading to black.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Transcription: Bouncing orange letters tumble into a line reading \"Nickelodeon Movies\".\n\nTrivia: This logo was made to fit with Nickelodeon's 2017 refresh by Superestudio.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Playing with Fire, the logo is shinier and the animation is sped up, causing the fanfare to be out of sync with the logo. The logo also cuts in and out instead of fading in and out.\n\nA prototype version of this logo (in which the background and logo are altered) can be seen on two trailers for Wonder Park. It is also still. The film itself uses the previous logo instead.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The beginning of the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions theme, with a bombastic orchestral redux of the last five notes composed by John Debney and Germaine Franco. The prototype version just has the opening theme of the trailer.\n\nAvailability: It was only seen on two Paramount Players films, Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019) and Playing with Fire (2019), both released in 2019.\n\nThe prototype version can be seen on two trailers for Wonder Park in 2018.\n\n14th Logo (August 14, 2020-present)[]\n\nVisuals: On a wall, we see SpongeBob SquarePants' hand (from his self-titled TV series) grabbing a lever and trying to pull it, but struggling at first. Once the lever is pulled, Nick's trademark slime starts flowing through a tube while electric sparks fly. The lights turn on, illuminating the Nickelodeon logo in several shots. The walls, ceiling and stairs drop to reveal a Hollywood-type area with five palm trees at sunrise, while a Nickelodeon blimp approaches and the word \"movies\" is drawn in a slimy green font. The blimp takes off toward the screen right before the logo cuts to black or fades out.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Transcription: SpongeBob's hand pulls down on a power switch. Green electricity floods a power cable and lights up an electric sign. Green slime forms a word below it, together they read, \"Nickelodeon Movies\".\n\nTrivia: During the lever scene, a sign is visible that reads \"Bikini Bottom Electric Co.\" (referring to the main location from SpongeBob SquarePants) and another sign has Nathan Love's name on it, plus a pineapple keychain (a nod to SpongeBob's house).\n\nVariants:\n\nA slightly shortened version was used on international Netflix prints of The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. The logo is faster and starts as SpongeBob starts trying to pull the lever.\n\nScope and still versions exist.\n\nAn in-credit version exists.\n\nSometimes, the logo is shortened to its final seconds.\n\nAt the end of Blue's Big City Adventure, the shortened version has a copyright stamp below.\n\nAt the start of Ready Friends The Guys,The logo is colored Red and Green.\n\nTechnique: A mix of CGI and 2D animation. This was done by Nathan Love. None for the still version, and the credits scrolling for the in-credit version.\n\nAudio: SpongeBob (voiced by Tom Kenny) grunting as he pulls the lever, then electrical noises as the slime flows, twelve light clicks, and finally, a dramatic orchestral recreation of the last five notes of the Nickelodeon jingle (similar to the previous logo), ending with a ding noise.\n\nAudio Trivia: The Nickelodeon jingle in this logo was composed by Explosion Robinson (best known for composing the music for the Nickelodeon branding from 2017 to 2023).\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, we can hear SpongeBob yelling his catchphrase, \"I'm ready!\", at the beginning, and we can also hear him singing along with the jingle at the end, ending with a \"Ta-da!\".\n\nThere's a shortened version of the above variant where the blasting electric sound effect (while the lights turn on) is absent and only eight light clicks are heard, instead of twelve. The flow is also slightly sped up. This was heard on international Netflix prints of The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.\n\nSometimes, SpongeBob's grunting noises are absent, or the opening theme of the film is used.\n\nNone for the still version.\n\nThe in-credit version just uses the ending theme of the movie.\n\nThe shortened version has the last few seconds of the logo's music or the ending theme of the movie.\n\nAt the end of Ready Friends The Guys,The echo carries on the 87North Productions logo\n\nAvailability: Unlike previous logos, this is not only used theatrically, but also on made-for-television (except certain ones) and streaming films.\n\nSeen on most Nickelodeon films starting with The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020) (also the first film to use the Paramount Animation logo).\n\nAlso seen on international prints of PAW Patrol: The Movie, where this logo and the Paramount Pictures logo plaster the Elevation Pictures logo.\n\nAlso seen on Paramount Pictures prints of Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, as the Sky Originals logo for the British print and Huayi Brothers logo for the Chinese print plaster this logo and the Paramount Pictures logo on said prints of the film.\n\nThis logo is currently being used in tandem with the 11th logo, but most recently appeared on Monster High 2.\n\nLegacy: When it debuted, it was assumed to be a custom variant used exclusively for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, given the similar animation style that the logo used. However, as it gained more widespread use, this was confirmed false.\n\nUnused Logos[]\n\nPlanned Charlotte's Web custom variant (2006)[]\n\nVisuals: We see a group of dark blue jays flying to the right against a light blue daytime sky with clouds. As the dark blue jays start grouping together towards the right of the screen in the distance, a group of American robins with orange bellies fly to the left as both groups of birds form the Nickelodeon Movies logo. The birds eventually scatter as the camera pans down, seguing into the opening credits of the movie.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability: This logo was planned to appear on Charlotte's Web (2006), but the 9th logo was used instead. This logo can be seen online.\n\n(2011)[]\n\nVisuals: The sun rises, revealing a silhouette of a girl holding a ship's wheel. The camera zooms out, eventually revealing the whole ship. the ship appears to either have or grow wings, which it then uses to fly off into the sunrise. The sun is revealed to be the letter \"i\" in \"nickelodeon\". The rest of the wordmark rises from the sea, with the word \"MOVIES\" seemingly following suit.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: Unknown, as only style frames exist.\n\nAvailability: Only style frames exist. However, it is not known what company made this logo, as said style frames can only be found on a DeviantArt post, with the uploader not stating its source.\n\nBig Bang (2013)[]\n\nVisuals: An orange splat-like blob is seen over a black background. it then swirls and splatters into a multicoloured liquid, eventually filling the screen in a supernova-like \"Frutiger Aero\" esque setting, populated by small, quirky multicoloured 3D shapes, which are described to \"bounce, squish, pulse, zoom, and twirl across space\". The entire scenery collapses onto itself, forming what is described as \"a condensed, heated energy\", which is described to form the dot of the letter \"i\". This then zooms out, revealing the rest of the Nickelodeon wordmark, which the word \"MOVIES\" appears under. This last section took place on a cream-coloured background.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Christopher Lopez at Imaginary Forces.\n\nAudio: Unknown, as only style frames exist.\n\nAvailability: Can only be seen in the form of style frames on Christopher Lopez's website.\n\n(2015)[]\n\nVisuals: A big, fuzzy orange ball bounces onto a suburban neighborhood. the letter \"c\" starts chasing after it, with the other letters (seemingly sporting different textures) following suit. they travel through some alps, before ending at a small town, which some letters appear to bounce off the roofs of the houses of. The letters arrive at a big city, with cars driving and people walking about, quote: \"where they hop over everything and everyone,[...] bouncing and hurling with fun acrobatic style\". It is presumed that the orange ball becomes the dot of the letter \"i\". The letters seemingly arrive at an area populated with many buildings, one of which the letters are described to make their way to the top of. they take a final step, leaping over the city. The camera quickly pulls around to reveal the Nickelodeon Movies logo, over a night city skyline.\n\nTechnique: A hybrid of live-action footage and CGI animation by Christopher Lopez at Imaginary Forces.\n\nAudio: Same as before.\n\nAvailability: Same as before.\n\nContainers of Nick (2016)[]\n\nVisuals: Taking place on an orange background, the different letters of the Nickelodeon wordmark are seen, each containing a different scene.\n\nThe first \"n\" contains an underwater scene, with a ship, an octopus, and many shapes in the ocean.\n\nThe letter \"i\" is seen sideways, containing a seen of a nightly forest. Two UFOs are seen, one of which is abducting a cow.\n\nThe letter \"c\" contains a bowling-inspired scene, containing a bowling ball, few pins, and two curved arrow-shaped signs. A yellow, seemingly 1950s-inspired wallpaper featuring various small burst shapes is seen behind it all.\n\nThe letter \"k\" contains a polygonal environment with mountains and trees. A yellow biplane is seen flying.\n\nThe letter \"e\" contains a purple starfield with an astronaut floating. Various blobs are present.\n\nThe letter \"o\" contains a polygonal icy cave, with some bats present.\n\nThe letter \"d\" contains a different underwater scene, with a yellow background. a polar bear is seen in the water, along with some chunks of ice, and what appear to be clouds in the sky.\n\nThe letter \"e\" from before is seen behind the \"d\".\n\nThis cuts to the Nickelodeon Movies logo. The word \"movies\" is seen in a white script font, while what appears to be paper lids over each letter of the Nickelodeon logo close down.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Ray Lux at Transistor Studios.\n\nAudio: Unknown, as only style frames exist.\n\nAvailability: Unused. Can only be seen in the form of style frames on Ray Lux's website.\n\nMonolith Splat! (2017)[]\n\nVisuals: A zooming vortex-like background is seen where the letter \"i\" is seen below. The other letters seemingly quickly swirl from the vortex onto place, forming the Nickelodeon logo as the green word \"movies\" (in a blobby font) appears. The vortex changes to a blue background.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Ray Lux at Transistor Studios.\n\nAudio: Same as \"Containers of Nick\".\n\nAvailability: Same as \"Containers of Nick\".\n\nMovie Shoot (2018)[]\n\nVisuals: On an orange background with what seems to be an anime-like zoom effect, we see a movie camera with two stage lights as the letter \"i\" is seen. The next style frame shows the finished product, a recording studio featuring a director's chair next to some rounded boxes, the camera and lights from before, and a stage, where a flower shape is seen going from in front to behind it. the walls of the studio are decorated with some squares. the Nickelodeon logo is seen on the stage, and clapperboard which reads \"MOVIES\" is seen floating.\n\nTrivia: The flower shape is a clear reference to the flower clouds seen on SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nVariant: What seems to be an alternate of the final style frame exists, set in what seems to be the same stage with different lighting, and some position changes. the chair is now in front of the boxes, and the Nickelodeon logo, along with the stage, seem to be closer to the screen. The blue word \"MOVIES\" in a bold font is seen in front of the Nickelodeon wordmark, as well as three letters (\"n\", \"d\", and \"k\") situated behind the wordmark. It is unknown whether this is intended to be part of the logo, or if it is an alternate take of the logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Ray Lux at Transistor Studios.\n\nAudio: Same as \"Containers of Nick\"."
