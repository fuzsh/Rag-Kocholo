        "text": "Press release of the City of Kassel:\n\nThe City of Kassel has purchased the artwork Public Daycare / Eltern und Kleinkinder Krippe (Public Daycare / Parents and Babies Crèche) by artist Graziela Kunsch – a work that garnered great enthusiasm at documenta 15 held at the Fridericianum. A fundraising campaign made the purchase possible.\n\nThe artwork can now be seen and enjoyed, initially temporarily, at Wolfsschlucht 18A. It will form part of a new inner-city meeting, play, and learning space for children and young people aged 0 to 12, which is the initiative of non-profit organization Gewächshaus e.V. Commenting on the project, Lord Mayor Sven Schoeller said: \"I would like to thank all supporters whose financial contributions have helped to ensure that the documenta artwork is preserved for Kassel. The purchase and making Public Daycare accessible to the public are further important building blocks in our efforts to keep the spirit of documenta alive in our city in between exhibitions. At the same time, the artwork represents a wonderful and educationally valuable addition to the creative offerings for our youngest citizens.\"\n\nPurchase of the Artwork by the City of Kassel\n\nDuring documenta 15, the artwork Public Daycare / Eltern und Kleinkinder Krippe by Brazilian artist Graziela Kunsch, was part of Fridskul (Fridericianum as a School) and created a space for learning and meeting on the ground floor of the Fridericianum Museum. The \"Parents and Babies Crèche\" for children aged 0 to 3 years and their caregivers, which is inspired by the educational approach of the 20th century Hungarian pediatrician Emmi Pikler, was so popular that the City of Kassel, together with documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and the artist, launched a fundraising campaign in which private donors as well as foundations and companies participated. In addition to the private donations, the support of the cdw Foundation, Kasseler Sparkasse, Wintershall Dea AG, Volksbank Kassel Göttingen, and the Gerhard Fieseler Foundation all contributed significantly to the successful purchase. The total sum for the acquisition, including all other services and ancillary costs, amounts to around EUR 80,000.\n\nProf. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann, Managing Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGbmH, adds: \"Graziela Kunsch's artwork Public Daycare quickly became one of the favorite sites for visitors at documenta 15. I am therefore particularly pleased that the artwork has been secured for Kassel thanks to the commitment of so many people. And indeed I do believe in the special potential of this artwork as a cultural space in its own right – as a low-threshold cooperation space, a direct networking site, and as a lighthouse project for rethinking living art.\"\n\nTemporary Location for Public Daycare at Wolfsschlucht 18A\n\nPublic Daycare now has a temporary home at Wolfsschlucht 18A. Gewächshaus e.V. is currently designing a new inner-city meeting, play, and learning space for children and young people aged 0 to 12 and their parents or caregivers, which will also bear the title Gewächshaus. The \"Parents and Babies Crèche\" will be integrated into this in cooperation, with the City of Kassel as the owner, and will cater to the needs of the youngest users. The City of Kassel is supporting the management of the artwork with EUR 15,000 per year. The artist Graziela Kunsch, who is responsible for the architectural adaptation of the artwork to the new spaces together with Kassel-based artist Elke Avenarius, emphasizes: \"The new premises are also about creating a place with Public Daycare where the main focus is not on teaching infants and toddlers by their parents. Instead, the aim is to enable adults to learn from their babies and promote their autonomy. Observing free play activities helps adults to better understand their children and subsequently support their natural development.\"\n\nThe Gewächshaus is a non-commercial space specially designed for families with children offering activities for adolescents of different ages. Sarah Metz from Gewächshaus e.V. explains: \"Our aim with the Gewächshaus is to create a cost-free and barrier-free space that promotes play, creativity, and integration and appeals to as many people as possible. Families are welcome to use the space and its facilities in a self-reliant way, meet up there, or take part in the workshops on offer with their children. The Gewächshaus therefore meets the urgent need for a meeting place for children and their carers in Kassel's city center.\"\n\nThe Gewächshaus is currently being set up, opening its doors for the first time on July 16, 2024. The new location will then be available to all interested parties every Tuesday to Saturday from 1.00 pm to 6.00 pm. The Gewächshaus will initially run on a trial basis until May 31, 2025.\n\nBackground: Public Daycare / Eltern und Kleinkinder Krippe – a documenta 15 Artwork\n\nDuring documenta 15 (2022), the Fridericianum was transformed into the Fridskul (Fridericianum as a School). During the 100-day exhibition, the ground floor of the building was a dynamic space with a focus on the exchange of knowledge, stories, and experiences and was designed as a corresponding meeting and community space. It housed the projects Gudskul, ruruKids, Common Library, and Graziela Kunsch's Public Daycare / Eltern und Kleinkinder Krippe. The Public Daycare project consisted of transforming a 200 square meter space within the Fridericianum into a free venue for children aged 0 to 3 and their caregivers. Inspired by the pedagogical approach of Hungarian pediatrician Emmi Pikler (1902-1984), Graziela Kunsch talked about her findings on free movement development and mindful interaction with young children, enabling them to experience respectful interaction right from their early years. The crèche area, specially designed with Kassel project partner Elke Avenarius, allowed visitors to experience this at first hand. The physical components of the artwork were put into storage following documenta 15. Already during the documenta 15 exhibition period, a committed group of supporters was formed who campaigned for the long-term retention of the artwork Public Daycare in Kassel and actively participated in the deliberations regarding its purchase, operation, and storage. With the successful acquisition of Public Daycare by the City of Kassel, the artwork is now accessible again at Wolfsschlucht 18A.\n\nSix outstanding international contemporary art experts have been appointed to documenta 16's new Finding Committee, unanimously approved by the Supervisory Board upon recommendation of the Managing Director. The Committee brings together Yilmaz Dziewior, Sergio Edelsztein, N'Goné Fall, Gridthiya Gaweewong, Mami Kataoka, and Yasmil Raymond.\n\nThe Finding Committee has the task of inviting pioneering figures in contemporary art to submit their concept to become the Artistic Direction of documenta 16 in Kassel and of then selecting the most promising format for implementation from those submissions presented.\n\nThe Managing Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, Andreas Hoffmann, states: \"I am delighted we have succeeded in attracting such a high-caliber Finding Committee for documenta 16, immediately following on from the Organizational Development. With their proven expertise and varied backgrounds, the participants represent to an extraordinary degree the diversity and international nature of the documenta exhibitions. With their commitment to the Finding Committee, they demonstrate a great sense of responsibility for contemporary art and documenta at this very special time – something for which I would like to thank all members of the Committee most sincerely. I look forward to working with them and to resolutely proceeding towards documenta 16 with this line-up. I am certain that the expert and multi-perspective make-up of the new Finding Committee will lead to a forward-looking proposal for the Artistic Direction. This lays the foundation for the international art world to once again be a familiar and welcome guest in Kassel.\"\n\nThe Members of the Finding Committee:\n\nYilmaz Dziewior (*1964 Bonn, Germany) is Director of Museum Ludwig in Cologne.\n\nPreviously, Dziewior was Director of Kunsthaus Bregenz (KUB) from 2009.

This will form the orientational framework for the work of documenta. In contrast, the Artistic Direction will not be required to develop its own Code of Conduct. Instead, a public event organized jointly with documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH is to be held early on in the regular documenta event schedule after the appointment of the Artistic Direction, where the Artistic Direction will present their artistic concept and also explain their understanding of respect for human dignity and how this is to be ensured in the exhibition they are to curate.\n\n- The Supervisory Board will not be reduced in size. In this way, the City of Kassel and the State of Hesse will be adequately represented. Two representatives of the federal government will be admitted to the Supervisory Board as full members with voting rights.\n\nIn line with METRUM’s Recommendations, the Finding Committee and the procedure for its appointment at the suggestion of the Management will be retained, whereby soft selection criteria meeting the goal of diversity will continue to be strengthened. Furthermore, a Scientific Advisory Board (“Wissenschaftlicher Beirat”) consisting of six people will be established, with its Chair to sit on the Supervisory Board as an advisory member without voting rights, and the tasks of the Management and Artistic Direction to be clarified with a clear separation of executive and curatorial roles – with the latter enjoying full artistic freedom. Finally, a Management Board will be established within documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, to which the department heads and also the future Artistic Direction will belong.\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and Lord Mayor of the City of Kassel, Sven Schoeller, emphasizes: \"With the expert opinions obtained after documenta 15, including METRUM’s Final Report, and the resolutions adopted today, documenta gGmbH heads into the future strengthened with an effective set of instruments for the protection of artistic freedom and for protection against anti-human discrimination and anti-Semitism. The transparent process surrounding the Recommendations for the Organizational Review and the committed participation of the interested public contributed to the balanced decisions we had to make in this difficult area of conflict. On behalf of documenta gGmbH, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for this.\" He adds: \"The skepticism towards the proposal of a Code of Conduct that was already apparent within the committees prior to the commenting procedure was also echoed by a number of submissions during the commenting procedure, although the position here is viewed from a discursive perspective. The solution of an event format that has now been adopted fulfills the purpose pursued by the consulting firm METRUM with its proposal of the two Codes of Conduct – namely early dialogue between the Artistic Direction and those responsible at the organizing gGmbH – without affecting the aspect of artistic freedom. Thanks to this solution, we can therefore dispense with the second Code of Conduct and still achieve the intended protective purposes.\"\n\nThe Hessian Minister of State for Science and Research, Art and Culture and newly elected Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Timon Gremmels, emphasizes: \"It is one of the most complex tasks of current cultural policy to strike a practicable balance between the protection of artistic freedom and the preservation of human dignity. Even in times of the increasing conflicts that are now playing out in the art world, both these lofty values must be respected in equal measure. Today, we have created the pre-conditions for this to succeed at the next documenta. I am confident that, with the clearly defined division of roles between Management and Artistic Direction, incidents like those at documenta 15 will not be repeated.\"\n\nAndreas Hoffmann, Managing Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, says: \"I am convinced that with the toolbox we have now adopted, we are ideally positioned to make great strides towards documenta 16. The first step is to set up the International Finding Committee very swiftly.\"\n\nPublic Commenting Procedure\n\nThrough the public commenting procedure, those commissioning the Organizational Development invited comments on five key Recommendations from the Final Report of the Organizational Development, between December 21, 2023 and January 31, 2024. The evaluation was carried out by Prof. Dr. Joanna Ozga (Professor of International Management at Fulda University of Applied Sciences) and her research assistant, Mira Bickert.\n\nDownload:\n\nSupervisory Board Resolution\n\nGemeinsame Erklärung der Kultusministerkonferenz, der Beauftragten der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien und der kommunalen Spitzenverbände, vom 13. März 2024 (Joint Declaration by the Conference of Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs, the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, and the Municipal Umbrella Organizations (German only), dated March 13, 2024)\n\nEvaluation Report by Prof. Dr. Joanna Ozga and Mira Bickert, dated February 5, 2024\n\nRaw Data of the Submissions in the Commenting Procedure (German only), dated February 7, 20\n\nMETRUM’s Statement on the Results of the Commenting Procedure, dated April 8, 2024\n\nFinal Report of the Organizational Development of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH now available – with a focus on effective measures against anti-Semitism and other forms of group-specific hatred while fully protecting artistic freedom\n\nDownload Final Report of the Organizational Development of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH.\n\nIn the wake of the anti-Semitism incidents at documenta 15, the shareholders, the City of Kassel, and the State of Hesse commissioned a review and analysis by an expert team led by Prof. Dr. Nicole Deitelhoff and, based on their final report, initiated a comprehensive, externally supervised organizational development report for the documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and its committee structures that started in May 2023.The results of the review are now available.\n\nThe management consultant Metrum Unternehmensberatung commissioned with this review has made recommendations in its final report – based on around 50 background interviews, workshops, and focus groups as well as various documents. These relate to the governance structure as well as process organization and organizational structure. The aim of the organizational development is to establish effective measures against anti-Semitism and other forms of group-specific hatred while fully protecting artistic freedom, as well as to increase the crisis resilience and future viability of the non-profit documenta und Museum Fridericianum GmbH.\n\nAfter today's Supervisory Board meeting, the full final report will be publicly available in German and English.\n\nThe key recommendations are as follows:\n\n1. Retention of the Finding Committee with adjustments (page 22)\n\nThere should continue to be a Finding Committee for each documenta exhibition, which is appointed by the Supervisory Board on the proposal of the Management of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH. This committee should no longer spill over into the governance of the exhibition and the process should be subject to just two optimizations: It should be set out in writing and the Management should commit to ensuring maximum diversity in its remit.\n\n2. Development of two Codes of Conduct for documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and the Artistic Direction (page 24)\n\nThe Code of Conduct of the gGmbH should describe the basic values guiding all actions of the gGmbH. One focus should be to \"make it clear that it takes an unambiguous stance against anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of discrimination and will also use its influence to achieve this goal while respecting artistic freedom\". The Code of Conduct of the Artistic Direction should describe the basic values of the Artistic Direction and contain passages that illustrate how it is ensured the exhibition curated by the Artistic Direction does not violate human dignity. Both Codes of Conduct should be treated as declarations of intent on an equal footing and oblige those involved to exchange views on the Codes of Conduct at an early stage in order to identify any differences and, where possible, to address potential conflicts in a productive manner. In accordance with Germany’s constitution or the German Basic Law, this structured approach is intended to take into account the balance between artistic freedom on the one hand and the duty of public cultural administration to avoid discrimination on the other.\n\n3. Optimization of the structure of the Supervisory Board and establishment of a Scientific Advisory Board (page 27)\n\nThe main responsibility for supervision is generally assumed by the Supervisory Board, while the Shareholders’ Assembly is generally limited to a few central tasks. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board will be reduced to five to nine members, who (with the exception of two) will be appointed equally by the two shareholders. The Federal Government is given a voting seat on the Supervisory Board and appoints the chair of the Scientific Advisory Board who will also be a member of the Supervisory Board. The Scientific Advisory Board to be established should comprise six or nine members from the artistic-curatorial field and advise the Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n4. Clarification of the tasks of the Management Board and Artistic Direction (page 29)\n\nThe division of responsibilities between the Management and Artistic Direction should be regulated in a binding set of Rules of Procedure for the Management. Essentially, this division should make it clear that the Management does not take on any curatorial tasks, but bears overall responsibility for strategic, organizational, and financial issues, is responsible for protecting the values formulated in a Code of Conduct of the gGmbH, and represents these in dialogue with the Artistic Direction. If necessary, in extreme cases this can also mean the Management has the responsibility to distance itself from some artistic content without intervening in it itself.\n\n5. Introduction of a Management Board (page 39)\n\nTo ensure effective leadership and very good internal communication, in line with the new Organizational Chart, a Management Board for the gGmbH should be established. The Heads and Directors as well as the Management and Artistic Directions should be represented on the Management Board of the gGmbH.\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and Lord Mayor of the City of Kassel, Sven Schoeller, states: \"The events and developments surrounding the emergence of anti-Semitic content, works, and stances at documenta 15 have shown that the organization of the world's most important exhibition of contemporary art did not have the appropriate instruments, structures, and procedures in place to adequately address the situation. It is of central importance for the future of documenta to regain the trust that has been lost as a result of this and following the resignation of the Finding Committee for the Artistic Direction of documenta 16. The responsible bodies at documenta will therefore take the utmost care to ensure that a clear organizational framework is established for future exhibitions that unequivocally guarantees artistic freedom for the Board of Trustees and artists and, at the same time, implements effective and efficient measures to combat anti-Semitism. The final report on organizational development provides an excellent basis for this. As soon as documenta's bodies have made a final decision on the recommendations of the Organizational Review, the search process for an Artistic Direction will be restarted. This is planned for the first quarter of 2024\"\n\nDeputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and Hessian Minister for Science and Art, Angela Dorn, emphasizes: \"As shareholders, we have pledged to learn real lessons from the anti-Semitic misconduct at documenta 15. It has become clear how important it was to undertake a comprehensive and self-critical analysis of responsibilities and structures. With these recommendations, we have created a good basis for safeguarding the unique character of documenta and at the same time for instituting its further structural development. Our main goal is to ensure that anti-Semitic incidents do not happen again. It is essential for the future of documenta that documenta 16 is not overshadowed by documenta 15.\"\n\nManaging Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, Andreas Hoffmann, adds: \"Having worked intensively on organizational development from day one of my work for documenta, I am delighted to be able to share the results with the public. Anyone who studies the report will realize that it aims to implement as effective measures against anti-Semitism and other forms of group-specific hatred as it does to ensure that artistic freedom remains unconditionally and fully protected.\"\n\nThe final report by Metrum Managementberatung GmbH is available in German and English here.\n\nThe publication is also accompanied by an opportunity for interested members of the public to comment on the key recommendations. These were presented to the Supervisory Board today for information and have not yet been submitted for resolution. A corresponding platform, accessible via the website www.documenta.de, makes it possible to lodge comments on the five key recommendations for a period of just over one month from Thursday, December 21, 2023 (until January 31, 2024). documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH and its shareholders are interested in considering constructive comments, additions, and suggestions. The final decision on what will be incorporated into the organizational development process lies with the bodies of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH.\n\ndocumenta fifteen (June 18 to September 25, 2022) formed the focal point of a debate on the present day legacy of the Holocaust and colonialism. Now that some time has passed since the events of that time, documenta and Museum Fridericianum gGmbH would like to look forward, from documenta fifteen, with a symposium conceived by the documenta Institut: What impact has documenta fifteen had on art, politics, and the public sphere? In a series of talks, Nicole Deitelhoff, Klaus Holz, Yael Kupferberg, Thomas Macho, Meron Mendel, Armin Nassehi, Maria Neumann, and Natan Sznaider will take the floor. The event will be hosted by Heinz Bude.\n\nThe background for the symposium is a research project on documenta fifteen as a public event and place for discourse, led by Meron Mendel and Heinz Bude. The project explores the dispute over an exhibition of contemporary art and the question as to the role of Eurocentric modernism in a global society that can no longer be conceived from Europe alone. Publication of the research project is planned for summer 2024.\n\nCommenting on this Andreas Hoffmann, Managing Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH highlights: \"With its transgressions in the field of anti-Semitism, documenta fifteen amounted to a social watershed. Since then, the debate around artistic freedom and its limits has seen increasing polarization. I think it is very important to discuss this here in Kassel now some time has passed. I would therefore like to thank Heinz Bude very warmly for his work in this field and for his willingness to open it up to the public already now.\" Heinz Bude stresses, \"This symposium picks up on the issue of artistic freedom in dark times with the necessary calm, but also with the requisite clarity. I very much look forward to hearing our guests and to engaging in unfettered debate.\"\n\nProgram\n\nSymposium\n\ndocumenta fifteen as a Watershed Moment?

As part of the development of the documenta Institut, three tenure-track professorships in the departments of Humanities and Cultural Studies, Architecture, Urban Planning, Landscape Planning, and Social Sciences at the University of Kassel were established in 2021 with funding from the State of Hesse.\n\nPress contact\n\nJohanna Köhler\n\nLeitung Kommunikation und Marketing / Head of Communications and Marketing\n\ndocumenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH\n\nT + 49 561 70727-2520\n\nM + 49 151 18015290\n\npresse@documenta.de\n\nThe Finding Committee of documenta 16 consists of six renowned international experts in contemporary art: Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, Gong Yan, Ranjit Hoskoté, Simon Njami, Kathrin Rhomberg, and María Inés Rodríguez. The Supervisory Board at documenta gGmbH today appointed the Finding Committee for the exhibition, which will be held in Kassel from June 12 to September 19, 2027.\n\nThe Finding Committee has the task of inviting pioneering figures in contemporary art to apply to take on the role of Artistic Direction of documenta 16, and to select the most promising format from the concepts presented. Appointment of the Artistic Direction is targeted for late 2023 / early 2024.\n\n\"Today we are taking an important step towards documenta 16,\" declare Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Lord Mayor of Kassel, Christian Geselle, and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Hesse's Minister for Science and the Arts, Angela Dorn. \"We have been able to enlist six eminent experts from throughout the world who, with their different artistic, curatorial and cultural-theoretical backgrounds and indeed as individuals, together stand for the modernity, internationality, and diversity of documenta. The Finding Committee now has ample time to attract the best and most innovative concepts to Kassel. It is our goal to address the shortcomings surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism at documenta fifteen. Prerequisites for the next steps, including the already agreed organizational development , are in place. At the same time, we wish to give the world's most important exhibition of contemporary art the planning time and space and security that its unique status deserves. With the Finding Committee in place, we are ideally positioned to do so.\"\n\nIn appointing the Committee, the Supervisory Board is following the proposal of former documenta Artistic Directors who were entrusted with this task in November 2022: Catherine David (documenta 10, 1997), Roger M. Buergel (documenta 12, 2007), Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev (documenta 13, 2012), and Adam Szymczyk (documenta 14, 2017).\n\nThe outgoing Managing Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH Ferdinand von Saint André thanks those involved: “I would particularly like to acknowledge the efforts of documenta's former Artistic Directors. They have made their expertise available to us in difficult times out of their attachment to the organization. I would also like to thank the Supervisory Board, which prioritized the establishment of the Finding Committee following this proposal. Finally, I sincerely thank the members of the Finding Committee for entrusting documenta with their expertise to lay the foundation for documenta 16.\"\n\n\"We sincerely thank Ferdinand von Saint André for leading documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH with great commitment during a difficult phase,\" said Geselle and Dorn on behalf of the Supervisory Board. \"It took courage to take on this task and clarity of direction to complete it within the clearly defined interim period. Ferdinand von Saint André brought both of these things to the table. Andreas Hoffmann, who will take over as Managing Director on May 1, will find a documenta gGmbH that is well prepared for the upcoming changes.\"\n\nThe incoming Managing Director is delighted with the Supervisory Board's decision: \"With the Finding Committee presented today, we are attracting six top-flight personalities from the world of contemporary art to documenta 16.

He will take up his position in Kassel on May 1, 2023. Until then, Dr. Ferdinand von Saint André, hired as interim Managing Director at the close of documenta fifteen, will continue in charge as agreed.\n\n\"The decision to appoint the new Managing Director also charts the course for the future of documenta in Kassel,\" say Kassel's Lord Mayor Christian Geselle, Chairman of the Supervisory Board at documenta gGmbH, and his deputy on the Supervisory Board, Hesse's Minister of Art Angela Dorn. As a cultural institution of global significance, documenta must tackle questions of content and rise to structural challenges, he said. \"The Supervisory Board is convinced that in Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann we have found a cultural manager who is as experienced as he is committed,\" they added. When announcing the new appointment, they also expressed their gratitude for the work of the interim Managing Director, Dr. Ferdinand von Saint André: \"His passion and professionalism in handling Kassel's and indeed our nation's precious cultural asset deserves the utmost respect,\" said Angela Dorn and Christian Geselle, voicing their appreciation for the interim Managing Director.\n\nCommenting on his new role, Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann said: \"documenta is one of the world's most important exhibitions of contemporary art. All editions of the world art exhibition have been key seismographs on the central discourses and challenges of our society as reflected in art. Managing documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH is a particularly diverse, exciting and honorable task, which I will approach with great respect, but also with a great deal of commitment and enthusiasm. I very much look forward to the close collegial cooperation with the expert teams at documenta, the Fridericianum, documenta Halle, the documenta Archive, the documenta Institute and the International Friends of documenta.\"\n\nIn the words of Prof. Manuel Hartung, CEO of the foundation ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius, the sponsor of the Bucerius Kunst Forum: \"documenta is an art exhibition of outstanding importance and reach – for my hometown Kassel, for Germany and for the international art world. I am delighted that Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann is able to take over as documenta's Managing Director in such challenging times. Andreas Hoffmann has shaped the Bucerius Kunst Forum in 15 years of very successful work – and made it a venue of highly acclaimed exhibitions and a forum on art in society. I heartily congratulate him on his leadership role at documenta!\"\n\ndocumenta 16 will be held in Kassel from June 12 to September 19, 2027. Until then, agreement on standards in dealing with artistic freedom and its limits, in addressing any group-specific form of misanthropy such as anti-Semitism, racism and antiziganism, but also the adaptation of organizational and committee structures as well as the definition of the framework conditions under which the artistic direction of documenta 16 will exercise its curatorial responsibility will all play a central role. Commenting on this Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann said: \"In addition, further increasing documenta's international appeal and developing innovative forms of art education will be important, as will supporting documenta's individual institutions in their current projects.\"\n\nBiography of Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann\n\nThe cultural manager Andreas Hoffmann, born in Norden in 1971, has been Managing Director at the Bucerius Kunst Forum since January 2007. Until 2019, he was also the programming manager for art and culture for the music and monument projects of the foundation ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius. Overseeing the forum's expansion in 2008 and the building of its new exhibition venue opening in 2019, he is responsible, amongst other things, for its interdisciplinary event programs. He is also curator of the antiquities exhibitions Pompeii. Gods, Myths, Man (2014) and New Images in the Age of Augustus. Power and Media in Ancient Rome (2022/3).\n\nFrom September 2004 to December 2006, he was Managing Director of the Friends of Hamburg Kunsthalle as well as Managing Director of the German Federation of Friends of Museums of Fine Art (Bundesverband der Fördervereine deutscher Museen bildender Kunst e.V.). As a research assistant from 2001 to 2004, he was responsible for the antiquities collection of the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe and curator of such exhibitions as The Etruscans. Luxury for the Afterlife (2004) or The Pyramid. House for Eternity (2002), but also Gunter Sachs (2004).\n\nHoffmann studied Classical Archaeology, Latin Philology, and Ancient History in Hamburg, Berlin, and Heidelberg and trained as a PR consultant while pursuing his career. In 2002, his doctoral thesis Death in Taranto. Grave Ritual and Society was published as part of a German-Italian research project on the comprehensive indexing of the necropolis in Taranto (Taranto Project). Since 2011 he has lectured at the Institute for Arts and Media Management at the University of Music and Theater in Hamburg, from 2016 as an honorary professor (pursuant to §17 of the HmbHG – German Higher Education Act). Since 2016, he has also been the spokesperson for the university’s Business and Marketing Faculty.\n\nIn addition to his professional activities, Andreas Hoffmann been part of the Supervisory Board of Kunsthalle Emden since 2017 and of the Board of Trustees of the German music foundation Deutsche Stiftung Musikleben since 2019.\n\nAndreas Hoffmann is married to the Classical Archaeologist Annette Haug.\n\nPortraitfoto of Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann for download.\n\nCredits: Prof. Dr. Andreas Hoffmann, photo: Götz Wrage.\n\nPress release for download\n\ndocumenta press contact\n\nJohanna Köhler\n\nHead of Communications and Marketing\n\ndocumenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH\n\nT +49 561 70727-2520\n\npresse@documenta.de\n\nA total of over 738,000 visitors—sustainability and accessibility as central concerns\n\nAfter 100 exhibition days, a third Meydan weekend, and several activations by the artists, documenta fifteen came to a successful close yesterday (Sunday). At 738,000 the number of visitors exceeded organizers' expectations. In line with current developments in the tourism and events industry, the number of group bookings marginally fell short of original expectations, but a slight increase in the number of season ticket holders was posted.\n\nOn exhibition space totaling more than 25,000 square meters, over 1,500 artists at 32 exhibition venues invited visitors to immerse themselves in lumbung practice. Events and activations were an integral part of documenta fifteen. Thus, over 1,700 events by the participating artists and their invited actors took place during the runtime. The opening weekend along with the packed Meydan program, concentrated over three weekends, was attended by a total of some 38,000 people.\n\nFollowing the lumbung practice, two urgent current topics loomed large in the way documenta fifteen sees itself: Sustainability was taken seriously with regard to socio-economic and ecological concerns: Through the so-called “sustainability euro,” which was included in the ticket, 375,000 euros in donations were generated for the reforestation of the Reinhardswald forest near to the City of Kassel and for ecological enrichment on Sumatra in Indonesia. Recycled materials dominated the infrastructure and exhibition design. Merchandise and print products focused on sustainable and regional products. For the first time, the ticket included travel on public transport. In the ongoing process, standards of responsible use of resources were consistently considered.\n\nAccessibility was another central concern. Based on lumbung values such as generosity and solidarity, documenta fifteen offered the so-called Soli-Ticket, which was intended to give as many people as possible access to the exhibition: By purchasing it at the regular ticket price, visitors gave another person free access to the exhibition. This ticket format, designed to increase accessibility, was well received; the Soli-Ticket was purchased a total of over 3,500 times and redeemed just as often. Accessibility has been seriously pursued by documenta fifteen as a continuous optimization process. Additional barriers were reduced and standards set via the website, Walks & Stories, and the exhibition accompanying booklet in easy language.\n\nFor the Artistic Direction, ruangrupa, the documenta fifteen exhibition in Kassel is a stage on their lumbung journey: “In the spirit of a sustainable process of learning from and with each other, we asked all the invited actors of documenta fifteen to continue their local practice and find a translation of it to Kassel. The results of this process formed the documenta fifteen exhibition. lumbung #1—as we also call the exhibition internally—is now closed, but the lumbung practice will live on after the 100 exhibition days. With independent self-organized platforms such as the lumbung.space website, the lumbung Gallery and lumbung Kios, we have created structures that will continue to be at the disposal of the lumbung network. We would like to take the opportunity to thank all those involved: the artists and collectives, the Kassel Ekosistem, the team of documenta fifteen and documenta gGmbH as well as the sobat-sobat and guards and all the others who have supported the project documenta fifteen with their heart and soul.”\n\nManaging Director Alexander Farenholtz sees the number of visitors as a success: “In view of the antisemitism debate that accompanied it, this documenta did not have an easy time placing its actual artistic concerns. I wish that when we look back at the exhibition we could also see it through the eyes of the many visitors: namely, as an artistic endeavor that addresses key issues of our time. To my mind, reaching visitor numbers only about 17 percent below those of documenta 14 in 2017 should be considered a success given the event was planned and executed under pandemic conditions with the associated drop in long-distance and group travel.”\n\nDigitally, documenta fifteen was also highly attended. The website was visited by a total of almost 700,000 unique visitors from 115 countries. The social media channel with the widest reach, Instagram, reached around 65,000 followers, and the Newsletter at its last count recorded around 29,500 subscribers.\n\nThose wishing to immerse themselves once again in impressions of the lumbung process in the exhibition retrospective can continue to follow a good 30 specially produced videos on central themes of documenta fifteen and artistic contributions, as well as the archived livestream events, in the documenta fifteen media library.\n\nFurther figures in detail and demographic data\n\nOver 15,150 season tickets (d 14 = 14,500) were sold. A total of around 5,250 Walks & Stories were offered, attended by around 78,700 participants. 33,000 schoolchildren in group tours visited documenta fifteen and around 4,600 representatives of the press were accredited.\n\nAround one-third (31.7 percent) of the public came from abroad and representing 86 countries around the world. Over 40 percent of visitors were aged between 15 and 40. The age group between 20 and 40 was most strongly represented.\n\nAccording to initial survey results, the majority of visitors rated their visit to documenta fifteen as good to very good. Thus, 57.4 percent of respondents gave documenta fifteen an overall rating of 1 or 2 (on a scale of 1 – very good to 5 – very poor). A further 30.1 percent gave it a 3. The representative visitor survey, which is expected in October, will provide information on further demographic data and visitor satisfaction.\n\nThe days posting the most visitors continued to be Saturday, followed by Friday, Tuesday, and Sunday; the most popular exhibition venues were the Fridericianum and documenta Halle, followed by Hallenbad Ost, Hübner-Areal, Grimmwelt, and St. Kunigundis Church.\n\nThe publications developed together with Hatje Cantz, including the 320-page Handbook and the family guide Walking, finding, sharing, will remain available as e-books in the future, even after physical copies have sold out.\n\nYesterday, Sunday, September 25, 2022, the dates for documenta 16 were announced in line with tradition by Christian Geselle, Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Lord Mayor of the City of Kassel. documenta 16 will run from June 12 to September 19, 2027.\n\nWe have been appointed by the shareholders of documenta gGmbH as a scientific advisory panel to analyze those works that have been identified or discussed as anti-Semitic, examine how documenta fifteen has dealt with incidents of anti-Semitism, and develop proposals on how to prevent similar occurrences in future. Due to the ongoing controversy surrounding individual exhibits there is a particular urgency for consultation on specific problematic works. We have therefore now already submitted to the shareholders an initial assessment by the panel on this issue. This assessment relates to a work over which consensus prevails within the body as to the need for immediate action. More detailed analysis on the organizational structures of the Artistic Direction and on other works will follow at a later date.\n\nAt the level of the exhibited works, the most urgent task, in the panel's view, is to stop the screening of the compilation of pro-Palestinian propaganda films from the 1960s-1980s by the collective Subversive Film, shown under the name Tokyo Reels Film Festival. What is highly problematic about this work are not only the film documents laced with anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist fragments, but also the artists' comments inserted between the films, where the hatred of Israel and the glorification of terrorism featured in the source material is legitimized through their uncritical discussion. The historical propaganda material is not critically reflected upon – as it doubtless should be – but affirmed as a purportedly objective factual report. As a result, the films pose a greater danger in their potentially inciteful impact than the already removed People's Justice work. Many of the films present Israel and its armed forces exclusively as perpetrators who deliberately attack civilians, especially women and children. By contrast, the Palestinian side is portrayed as innocent and defenseless. The repeated terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians are not mentioned here – nor in the entire exhibition – nor is the fact that Israel has been regularly attacked by the armies of Syria, Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, the one-sided negative portrayal of Israel turns into open anti-Semitism on several occasions. To cite but one example: Israel is accused of being \"fascist\" in nature and of carrying out \"genocide\" against the Palestinians – it is thus equated with National Socialist Germany. Equating Israeli policies with those of the Nazis in this way must be judged as anti-Semitic, for example, according to the definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which has been adopted by many nations, including some countries of the Global South. Also problematic is the genesis of the work. According to the documenta website, Masao Adachi played a role in entrusting Subversive Film with the film reels. Adachi was a member of the Japanese Red Army and collaborated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, two groups that carried out terrorist attacks against Israeli and other civilians, including the 1972 Lod Airport massacre where 26 people were murdered. A possible resumption of screenings of the films would only be conceivable if they were contextualized in a way that clarified the propaganda nature of the films, clearly identified their anti-Semitic elements, and corrected historical misrepresentations.\n\nThe panel is aware that documenta fifteen is exhibiting a multitude of outstanding and inspiring art works that it cannot take into consideration in its work. Its task consists of examining a selection of the works for their anti-Semitic content and clarifying why they are or were exhibited at documenta fifteen.\n\nWe have been appointed by the shareholders of documenta gGmbH as a scientific advisory panel to analyze those works that have been identified or discussed as anti-Semitic, examine how documenta fifteen has dealt with incidents of anti-Semitism, and develop proposals on how to prevent similar occurrences in future. Due to the ongoing controversy surrounding individual exhibits and documenta fifteen as a whole, there is a particular urgency for consultation on these issues. We have therefore submitted to the shareholders an initial assessment by the Undersigned Members of the Panel, which is more comprehensive in some respects than the statement by the panel as a whole.\n\n1. At the Level of Exhibited Works, Film and Archive Materials.\n\nAt the level of the exhibited works, the most urgent task, in the panel's view, is to stop the screening of the compilation of pro-Palestinian propaganda films from the 1960s-1980s by the collective Subversive Film, shown under the name Tokyo Reels Film Festival. What is highly problematic about this work are not only the film documents laced with anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist fragments, but also the artists' comments inserted between the films, where the hatred of Israel and the glorification of terrorism featured in the source material is legitimized through their uncritical discussion. The historical propaganda material is not critically reflected upon – as it doubtless should be – but affirmed as a purportedly objective factual report. As a result, the films pose a greater danger in their potentially inciteful impact than the already removed People's Justice work.\n\nMany of the films present Israel and its armed forces exclusively as perpetrators who deliberately attack civilians, especially women and children. By contrast, the Palestinian side is portrayed as innocent and defenseless. The repeated terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians are not mentioned here – nor in the entire exhibition – nor is the fact that Israel has been regularly attacked by the armies of Syria, Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, the one-sided negative portrayal of Israel turns into open anti-Semitism on several occasions. To cite but one example: Israel is accused of being \"fascist\" in nature and of carrying out \"genocide\" against the Palestinians – it is thus equated with National Socialist Germany. Equating Israeli policies with those of the Nazis in this way must be judged as anti-Semitic, for example, according to the definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which has been adopted by many nations, including some countries of the Global South. Also problematic is the genesis of the work. According to the documenta website, Masao Adachi played a role in entrusting Subversive Film with the film reels. Adachi was a member of the Japanese Red Army and collaborated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, two groups that carried out terrorist attacks against Israeli and other civilians, including the 1972 Lod Airport massacre where 26 people were murdered. A possible resumption of screenings of the films would only be conceivable if they were contextualized in a way that clarified the propaganda nature of the films, clearly identified their anti-Semitic elements, and corrected historical misrepresentations.\n\nIn the view of the Undersigned Members of the Panel, the Tokyo Reels Film Festival is the most glaring example of documenta fifteen's bias with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict which is dealt with by a comparatively large number of works. Almost all these works express attitudes that range from critically biased to decidedly anti-Israeli. These attitudes are reflected in the pictorial representations and statements, which can be judged as anti-Semitic according to commonly accepted criteria. This becomes particularly evident when the existence of Israel is questioned or denied in the works. From this perspective, the Undersigned Members of the Panel consider it necessary to examine the series of works \"Guernica Gaza\" and documents from the Archives des luttes des femmes en Algérie. The analysis of these and other works – among others by Taring Padi – is still ongoing. More detailed statements will be made available to the shareholders at a later date.\n\n2. At the Level of the Artistic Direction\n\nIn the view of the Undersigned Members of the Panel, the described bias of the presented positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be attributed to the individual artists, but is a consequence of a curatorial concept of the Artistic Direction, which deliberately refrained from control over the compilation and presentation of the exhibition. This in principle welcome dialogical and cooperative approach, however, does not change the overall curatorial responsibility of ruangrupa. The Artistic Direction alone had the opportunity to look at the exhibition from an overall perspective. Even if it may have deliberately refrained from such an overview, it remains responsible for the entire exhibition. As a result, the Artistic Direction is responsible for a documenta in which anti-Semitic works were exhibited and Israel and Israelis appear exclusively as perpetrators and aggressors. The impression of a curatorial imbalance is reinforced by the fact that the exhibition does not give any scope for debate on National Socialism and the Shoah and their consequences, nor to Jewish perspectives on the Middle East conflict, and by the fact that the Artistic Direction has always associated its own political project with the curation. We also find problematic the Artistic Direction's failure to grapple with the anti-Semitic incidents, the criticism of which is discredited as \"censorship\".\n\n3. At the Level of documenta Organization Also at the level of the documenta organization, the Undersigned Members of the Panel are of the opinion that the procedural processes and communication in response to the discussions are inadequate if not counterproductive. For dealing with problematic works, documenta does not seem to have a procedure in place that goes beyond examining the culpability of an exhibit. The documenta organization does not seem to be set up to mediate in the event of internal or public criticism of the project or the Artistic Direction. The Undersigned find it particularly regrettable that documenta management failed to enter into a sustained dialogue with representatives of the Jewish community in Germany after the events began.\n\nTaking these three levels together, it becomes clear that the serious problems of documenta fifteen exist not only in the presentation of isolated works featuring anti-Semitic imagery and statements, but also in a curatorial and organizational structural environment that allowed an anti-Zionist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel sentiment.\n\nSignatories:\n\nNicole Deitelhoff (Chair)\n\nJulia Bernstein\n\nMarina Chernivsky\n\nPeter Jelavich\n\nChristoph Möllers\n\nOn Saturday, August 6, 2022, documenta fifteen reached the halfway point of its 100-day run. By the 50th day, more than 410,000 visitors had visited documenta fifteen at 32 exhibition venues enjoying works by more than 1,500 artists. This means documenta fifteen's interim figures are close to those of the previous edition that boasted the hitherto highest number of visitors, and this despite the Covid-19 pandemic: documenta 14 was visited by 445,000 people during the first half of its run in Kassel.\n\nAt documenta fifteen, around over 25,000 schoolchildren were addressed in class groups during so-called School Walks and School Workshops (at the halfway point of documenta 14, 20,000 schoolchildren had already been addressed).\n\nIn addition, more than 14,600 season ticket holders followed the activities of documenta fifteen particularly closely.\n\nIn keeping with lumbung values such as generosity and solidarity, documenta fifteen is offering the solidarity ticket for the first time in documenta history, which is intended to give as many people as possible access to the exhibition: By purchasing it at the regular ticket price, one provides free access to the exhibition for one additional person. The solidarity ticket has already been purchased over 3,000 times and has been very well received.\n\nSo far, around 36,000 visitors have taken part in the Walks and Stories section – how the guided tours by the sobat-sobat art educators are called. That is almost 20,000 less than at documenta 14, where there were already 54,000 at the halfway point. From the point of view of documenta gGmbH, this drop is probably mainly due to the Covid-related impacts on the business and group travel market.\n\nAccording to the first interim results of the visitor survey, the ratio of visits from Germany to those from abroad, at around 70/30 percent, seems to roughly correspond to the result of documenta 14, at 65/35 percent.\n\nThe days of documenta fifteen with the highest number of visitors were Saturdays, followed by Fridays. Tuesdays were also better attended than other weekdays. The most frequented venues were Fridericianum, documenta Halle, Hallenbad Ost and Hübner Areal.\n\nEvents and activations are an integral part of documenta fifteen. As part of the lumbung and ruruHaus program, more than 830 events by participating artists and their cooperation partners have already taken place during the runtime. Meydan, with its packed program concentrated on three weekends of the runtime, had its successful kick-off from July 8–10, 2022 in the city center. Meydan #2 will take place next weekend, August 12–14, 2022, in cooperation with the Schlachthof Cultural Center and will present a series of concerts and events as well as the GDR International film program at the Gloria cinema.\n\nThe Artistic Direction ruangrupa as well as the artistic team are pleased that they have already been able to involve so many people with the community-oriented documenta fifteen: they see Kassel and documenta fifteen as an important stop for all participants on their joint lumbung journey: \"The lumbung community has already begun to connect with Kassel's urban society and its multitude of different communities, but also with the ekosistems of the artists in other places, in the ruruHaus before the opening. We wish that documenta fifteen can run its course until September 25 with all the activities that we – ruangrupa, the artistic team, artists and cooperation partners – have planned for it with the involved ekosistems. Together, we want to trigger impulses that can create sustainable changes in thinking and acting for all guests and participants even beyond the 100 days. The working groups, such as lumbung Gallery, lumbung Kios, lumbung.space and lumbung Radio are also working intensively on this. We would like to already now express our great appreciation and gratitude to all the visitors, artists, team, supporters, and partners.\"\n\nIn order to strengthen documenta fifteen as a place of mutual learning and understanding, the Artistic Direction is currently adding contextualizations in various formats to several works in the exhibition. This process has already been initiated and will be successively continued.\n\nIn addition, the intended bilingualism (English / German) in the exhibition will be increasingly pursued by adding more label and wall texts in German to increase the accessibility of the contributions.\n\nStarting on Saturday, April 3, 2021, the seven-part conversation series lumbung calling launches documenta fifteen’s Public Program, activated under the title Meydan. Each edition of the series is dedicated to one of the lumbung values: Local Anchor, Humor, Generosity, Independence, Transparency, Sufficiency, and Regeneration. The format dives deeper into the background of the artistic concept for documenta fifteen and illuminates the idea of lumbung from many different angles.\n\nThrough conversations with a variety of guests, lumbung calling will explore the rich meaning of lumbung across multiple disciplines, points of view, and contexts within an artistic framing. The invited protagonists have faced major challenges and initiated true revolutions on various scales: academics, cultural activists, independent researchers, organic farmers, fishermen, and festival organizers, among others.\n\nlumbung calling will take place on the first Saturday of every month over seven sessions, from April to October 2021. The conversation series will begin digitally through documenta fifteen’s social media channels YouTube and Facebook. As soon as the restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic allow, lumbung calling will shift to a hybrid format and eventually take place as a physical event in Kassel.\n\nlumbung as a set of values and a cosmology\n\nWith its unique shapes and styles, lumbung is an easily recognizable building in Indonesia, similar to a barn. In the official dictionary of the Indonesian language, Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, lumbung is defined as “a container to store agricultural products, commonly rice, in the form of a house on stilts with walls of woven wood or bamboo.” This definition has implications for the way lumbung is interpreted: lumbung can be defined as a place to store harvested crops, particularly in agrarian societies. At the same time, this description confines the meaning of the word to a distinctive architecture. As a practice, however, lumbung transcends its physical appearance as a building and expands to include spaces beyond the agricultural. In Indonesia’s cultural discourse, the term lumbung is used to describe shared collective resources. Seen from this point of view, lumbung is not only a building or object but also a set of values and a cosmology that describes the living practice of a society. It is evidence of a communal life marked by the spirit of collaboration, and its characteristics can be traced back to premodern societies. Today, the accelerated development and modernization of predominantly capitalist modes of production demand a constant redefinition of values. lumbung calling asks how these values can be translated into artistic practice and open up new spaces for conversation.\n\nFirst edition of lumbung calling: Local Anchor\n\nThe first lumbung calling on April 3, 2021, focuses on the value of Local Anchor. The metaphor of an anchor describes the value of soil in our globalized yet divided world: soil that enables roots to grow and connects trees located miles and miles apart. Just as trees echo each other’s signals, harvesting and cultivation methods can resonate with and be amplified by local wisdoms, bringing to life new resources, and developing diverse relationships with time. Guests Melani Budianta and Armin Salassa examine ways of challenging integrated models of political, social, and economic behavior in a discussion unfurling from the point of view of a seed to the tender voices of concerned mothers. The first edition of lumbung calling will be hosted by Jumana Emil Abboud and Mirwan Andan. The event will be held in English and translated into International Sign Language.\n\nMelani Budianta is a professor of Literature and Cultural Studies in the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Indonesia and a member of the Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Society. Since the late 1980s, Budianta has undertaken research and writing focused on gender and cultural activism. Her articles have been published in academic journals, newspapers, and magazines. During the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998, she participated in Indonesia’s women’s movement. In 2020, Melani Budianta presented her talk Lumbung Budaya Sepanjang Gang or Cultural Granaries Along the Alleys, organized by the Jakarta Art Council.\n\nArmin Salassa is a farmer and activist in Bulukumba, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In 2011, Salassa—along with farmers from the village where he was born—began implementing natural farming, an organic practice that has long existed in many other areas of the archipelago. Natural farming techniques combine scientific knowledge with wisdom, stories, and practices inherited from ancestors, removing the need for chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides. Since 1993, he has worked as a community organizer in various locations throughout Indonesia and advocated for the denied rights of Indigenous people in Palu, Central Sulawesi. Since 2007, Armin Salassa has assisted community organizations in numerous Indonesian villages, including Aceh, Sumatra, following the 2004 tsunami.\n\nJumana Emil Abboud’s creative interests lie in oral histories, personal and collective stories, and mythologies, particularly folk tales and their sites of being and unbeing. Abboud uses storytelling, performative elements, and workshop methodologies in her artistic practice to investigate our relationship to time and place, to the human and non-human, exploring tools of memory, attachment, and dispossession amid the challenge for continuity within political, ecological, and cultural struggles. Her work has been shown at The Jerusalem Show; BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, England; Sharjah Biennale, United Arab Emirates; Istanbul Biennale, Turkey; and Venice Biennale, Italy, among many others. She has participated in art residencies including, Sakiya – Art/Science/Agriculture, Palestine; Delfina Foundation, England; Arts Initiative Tokyo, Japan; and Guestatelier Krone, Switzerland. Jumana Emil Abboud is currently pursuing a practice-led PhD at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London.\n\nMirwan Andan is a member of ruangrupa, Artistic Direction of documenta fifteen.\n\nProgram\n\nlumbung calling: Local Anchor\n\nSaturday, April 3, 2021, 2.30 pm (CET), 7.30 pm (WIB), 8.30 pm (WITA)\n\nWith Melani Budianta and Armin Salassa, hosted by Jumana Emil Abboud and Mirwan Andan\n\nIn English with translation into International Sign Language\n\nLivestream via Facebook, YouTube and the ruruHaus window\n\nFurther Dates\n\nlumbung calling: Humor, Saturday, May 1, 2021\n\nlumbung calling: Generosity, Saturday, June 5, 2021\n\nlumbung calling: Independence, Saturday, July 3, 2021\n\nlumbung calling: Transparency, Saturday, August 7, 2021\n\nlumbung calling: Sufficiency, Saturday, September 4, 2021\n\nlumbung calling: Regeneration, Saturday, October 2, 2021\n\nThe documenta archiv has received as a gift the important legacy of thinker, art mediator, art critic, artist and professor Bazon Brock. Amongst other things, Bazon Brock founded the documenta “Besucherschulen” (Visitors’ Schools) thereby establishing the mediation of contemporary art as a critical independent practice with overarching cultural objectives.\n\nThe now presented comprehensive premature legacy is testimony to Bazon Brock’s decades of work at his cultural institution the “Denkerei” in Berlin and at his studio in Wuppertal. The legacy includes screen-prints, correspondence, slides, photos, teaching materials, image and sound material, publications, press clippings, art objects, digital data as well as 2,000 titles from his library with comments and notes permitting an insight into his modus operandi. For the documenta archiv, which belongs to documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, acquisition of this comprehensive collection means a valuable addition to its core inventory, also with regard to forthcoming documenta Institute. Together with the Arnold Bode legacy this addition will form the foundation to the curators’ center which is set to be further extended.\n\nThe gift will be accompanied by a generous donation from Dr. Hubert Burda. This commitment will allow for the collection to be indexed thereby paving the way for its public use and academic examination. Hubert Burda – celebrating his 80th birthday over the next few days – and Bazon Brock are linked by a decades-long friendship based, amongst other things, on shared ideas in the field of critical thinking and the productive culture of debate. Commenting on this Hubert Burda said: “One of my greatest achievements is perhaps that I have managed to bear with him over 50 years.” It was very important for Bazon Brock that his archive and parts of his collection were presented to the documenta archiv to be suitably prepared there as an “ordered premature legacy”: “It means a great deal to me to have found such an appropriate place for my life’s work that is accessible to the public.”\n\nChristian Geselle, Lord Mayor of the City of Kassel and Supervisory Board Chairman of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, is delighted with the gift: “This is a great addition for the documenta city of Kassel. Gaining such a key legacy for Kassel shows the huge potential the documenta archiv – only entrusted by the City to documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH three years ago – in terms of the historiography of documenta and also the development of contemporary art and art mediation.”\n\nThe State of Hessen also welcomes the addition. Commenting on this Hessen’s State Minister of Higher Education, Research and the Arts Angela Dorn said: “documenta regularly puts Hessen into the international spotlight delighting all those who are interested in art. In addition to the major cultural significance it is also welcomed that the move includes citizens and makes documenta an experience for them. Bazon Brock has carried out significant work in the field of art mediation. I am delighted that he is leaving his important life’s work to the documenta archiv in memory of the world art exhibition. And likewise that as a state Hessen will continue to grow as a center of this art mediation.”\n\nDr. Sabine Schormann, General Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, underlines the significance of this donation: “The breadth of Bazon Brock’s work, past and present, as a universal poet, teacher of aesthetics, author, speaker and creator of visitor and citizen schools is similarly reflected in the diversity, universality and rich contrasts of the legacy which we have now received as a gift for the documenta archiv. The fact that Hubert Burda has also decided to make such a generous donation for work on the legacy will pave the way to it being suitably indexed. We are deeply indebted to Bazon Brock and to him. The outgoing director of the documenta archiv, Dr. Birgit Jooss and her team, have also ensured that the legacy could be secured for Kassel through their many years of commitment and professional work.” The legacy will be presented in full upon completion of structural work on the documenta Institute, which is currently being established. The cataloguing work will begin before then.\n\nBazon Brock\n\nProf. Dr. Bazon Brock (born in 1936 as Jürgen Johannes Hermann Brock) studied German, Philosophy and Politics. He was a student of Adorno, lyricist, dramaturge, artist and Professor of Aesthetics and is considered an exponent of the Fluxus movement. He is the founder of the “Besucherschule” (Visitors’ School) that was held to accompany the documenta exhibitions 4, 5, 6 and 7 and which remained influential during documenta 8 and 9. In 1968 the concept advocated for a new kind of art mediation that promoted audience literacy at a visual level: the aim was to educate a qualified and informed art audience across the board. The concept also particularly became known by means of the “Audiovisual Foreword” of documenta 5.\n\ndocumenta archiv\n\nThe documenta archiv is part of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH. It is home to the written, image and electronic documents arising in connection with documenta exhibitions. With its unique holdings of the archive of records and papers, media collection and the library the documenta archiv also forms the nucleus of the documenta Institute initially being founded under the auspices of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH in cooperation with the German federal government, the Land of Hessen, the City of Kassel and the University of Kassel. The institute will stimulate, conduct and further develop research related to documenta and make it publicly visible.\n\nLucas Arruda Deserto-Modelo Ron Nagle Euphoric Recall June 6 to September 8, 2019\n\nThe exhibitions Deserto-Modelo by Lucas Arruda and Euphoric Recall by Ron Nagle mark the beginning of the program put together by the new Fridericianum director Moritz Wesseler.\n\nWith Lucas Arruda and Ron Nagle, the Fridericianum is presenting two artists who represent very disparate aspects of current art production and who are at decidedly different phases in the development of their artistic/intellectual voices. Whereas the former’s chosen path is painting, he hails from South America and by the time he had reached his early 30s had already formulated a remarkably lucid oeuvre, one which is now starting to receive international attention, the latter is a sculptor, has his roots in North America and with a consistent oeuvre spanning six decades can be considered a master of his métier. What they have in common is a passionate and even obsessive devotion to their chosen themes and areas of work, which accounts for the singularity of the art they produce.\n\nThe presentation of the work of Arruda and Nagle will be followed, in October 2019, by a comprehensive show of the oeuvre of artist Rachel Rose, who was born in 1986 and works with time-based media and sculpture, and in February 2020 by an exhibition of the work of painter Forrest Bess, who died in 1977. It will be the largest European show on Bess’ work in over 30 years. As such, with his new program for the Fridericianum Moritz Wesseler is on the one hand focusing attention on those artists who have to date been denied a platform in Germany in the institutional context, and, on the other, offering everyone an opportunity to rediscover historical positions that were for a long time obscured, despite having great relevance for current discourse.\n\nLucas Arruda Deserto-Modelo Deserto-Modelo is the title of the Fridericianum’s presentation of the first larger-scale institutional solo show by the artist Lucas Arruda, who was born in São Paulo in 1983. Arruda’s work comprises paintings, prints, light installations, slide projections and films. It reflects his intensive, dedicated examination of a wide spectrum of subjects, ranging from the conceptual framework of the genre that is painting to the existential conditions of life itself. A particular feature of Arruda’s praxis is his portrayal of landscapes and seascapes, although his work never references specific locations. On the contrary, he is concerned with capturing those imaginary places evoked by thoughts of landscapes and seascapes, and with looking into the light conditions, atmospheres and emotions connected with them. However, many of his works are characterized by such a degree of abstraction that the reference to a landscape is only suggested by the horizon lines that are present to varying extents.\n\nIndependent of the degree of their legibility, his visual formulations give rise to a moment of deceleration and concentration, which, in these increasingly fast-paced times we live in, takes us by surprise and, with its insistent yet peaceful power, raises not least the question as to which rhythms life follows in this globalized world.\n\nRon Nagle Euphoric Recall For more than six decades now, Ron Nagle has been producing works characterized by the fact that they manifest a maximum height of 20 cm. Despite their limited heights, these works, made among other things of ceramics, plastics, glazing agents and car paint, boast a presence and an effect which could hardly be more impressive. This accounts for the unique status of Nagle’s work within the sculpture genre and results from his works’ interplay of unusual shapes, diverse colors and tactile surfaces. Accordingly, in his objects, shapes with an organic feel to them meet architectural elements, brightly gleaming colors are confronted with unobtrusive, restrained hues and rough, porous surfaces contrasted with high-gloss ones. His work is not only uncommonly fresh, soulful and sophisticated; it is also mysterious and sometimes surreal. Nagle moreover provides his work with additional levels of meaning by furnishing it with elaborate titles which are usually characterized by a great propensity for wordplay and humor.\n\nEuphoric Recall at the Fridericianum is the first solo show in Germany by Nagle, who was born in San Francisco in 1939. An artist book is being published to mark the show, which is being realized in cooperation with the Vienna Secession.\n\ndocumenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH has appointed Moritz Wesseler as new director of Kassel’s Fridericianum as of November 1, 2018. The selection committee included: Krist Gruijthuijsen, director KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, Bettina Steinbrügge, director Hamburger Kunstverein, René Zechlin, director Wilhelm-Hack-Museum Ludwigshafen, and Dr. Sabine Schormann, designated general director, documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH.\n\nThe 37-year-old art historian and curator Moritz Wesseler was previously director of Kölnischer Kunstverein where he realized exhibitions with artists of international renown including Pietro Roccasalva, Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg, Andra Ursuta, Annette Kelm, Darren Bader, Petrit Halilaj, João Maria Gusmão + Pedro Paiva, Ketuta Alexi-Meskhishvili, Stephen G. Rhodes, Uri Aran, Andro Wekua, Christiana Soulou, Avery Singer, Danny McDonald, Talia Chetrit, Adriano Costa, Cameron Jamie, Alex Da Corte, and Walter Price. Parallel to organizing these presentations, a special emphasis of his programming was placed on outreach and publicity with the goal of opening Kölnischer Kunstverein to a wider audience. Lectures, conversations, concerts, and performances were held at the institution on a regular basis, while the introduction of the so-called Vereinsgabe, an edition series free of cost to association members with contributions by artists such as Rosemarie Trockel, Lawrence Weiner, Kai Althoff, Isa Genzken and Luc Tuymans, led to a boom in new membership. Moritz Wesseler is the successor of Susanne Pfeffer, who in early 2018 took a position at Frankfurt’s Museum für Moderne Kunst.\n\nChristian Geselle, Kassel’s lord mayor and chairman of the board of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, welcomes the decision: “With Moritz Wesseler, we have been able to gain a promising young director who intends to continue the great tradition of Fridericianum as a location of encounter and exchange with contemporary art into the future and to network the institution with important players from the region and around the world.\n\n”Boris Rhein, Hessen’s Minister for Science and the Arts and deputy chairman of the board, sees the new director of Fridericianum as a great opportunity to continue positioning the institution as a central location for contemporary art and to meet with an even greater audience response: “Moritz Wesseler has shown in Cologne that his demanding exhibitions found acceptance among a broad audience. We are convinced that he will continue to build bridges in Kassel.”\n\n“Fridericianum is an outstanding exhibition institution and plays an important role for Kassel’s reputation in the world,” in the words of Moritz Wesseler. “I look forward to moving to the city of the documenta and continuing the wonderful tradition of my predecessors. My goal is to offer a platform for key players in the realm of contemporary art still largely unknown in Germany. In addition, I intend to strengthen the institution’s connection within the city and the local region.”\n\n“I look forward to working with Moritz Wesseler,” says Dr. Sabine Schormann, designated general director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH. “Our joint goal is to keep Fridericianum’s tradition as a vital location of contemporary art.”\n\nOn Moritz Wesseler\n\nMoritz Wesseler, born in Bremerhaven in 1980, studied business and art history in Mainz and Paris. Even as a student, he began organizing exhibitions with artists such as Cathy Wilkes, Martin Boyce, Ceal Floyer, and Manfred Pernice. In addition, he edited artist’s books and catalogues on Gregor Schneider, Luc Tuymans, and Anri Sala, and began building up the archive of Bremerhaven’s Kabinett für aktuelle Kunst. After completing his studies, he took a position at Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf; later he was involved in organizing the exhibition series Double at Frankfurt’s Museum für Moderne Kunst and conceived the initiative Fürstenberg Zeitgenössisch in Donaueschingen and Heiligenberg, which features a fellowship and exhibition program. Besides working as a curator, he also publishes widely on twentieth century and contemporary art and participates in important juries on a national and international level. He has been serving as Hamburg’s Curator von Neue Kunst since September 2017.\n\nOn Fridericianum\n\nMuseum Fridericianum opened in 1779 as the world’s first museum intended for the public from the very beginning. Conceived in the spirit of the Enlightenment and designed by Huguenot architect Simon Louis du Ry, Fridericianum in the following years experienced a history marked by various disruptions but remained a venue of historical import.\n\nSince 1988, Fridericianum has been a central location of contemporary art. Significant positions and artistic currents and socially relevant questions are taken up, presented, and negotiated. The institution presents solo shows by international artists that often involve spatially expansive installations. Retrospectives are also part of the program. Thematically speaking, positions by artists critical of society and the period are given pride of place. Screenings and performances, conferences and symposia round out the program, covering the spectrum of contemporary art and debate.\n\nPreparations for documenta 15, which will take place in Kassel from 18 June to 25 September 2022, are progressing as planned. The Finding Committee for d 15 is in place. In accordance with the circular resolution recently presented to the members of the Supervisory Board of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH, the following experts have been appointed for the purpose of selecting the Artistic Director of documenta 15:\n\n– Ute Meta Bauer, Founder and Director of the Centre for Contemporary Art in Singapore – Charles Esche, Director of the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Netherlands\n\n– Amar Kanwar, artist, New Delhi, India\n\n– Frances Morris, Director of the Tate Modern in London, Great Britain\n\n– Gabi Ngcobo, Curator of the 10th Berlin Biennale 2018, South Africa\n\n– Elvira Dyangani Ose, Curator, Creative Time, New York, USA\n\n(Director of The Showroom in London, Great Britain, effective September 2018)\n\n– Philippe Pirotte, Director of the Staatl. Hochschule für Bildende Künste – Städelschule in Frankfurt/M., Germany (Belgium)\n\n– Jochen Volz, Director of the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil\n\nThe task facing the Finding Committee constituted on the basis of the recommendation by designated General Director Dr. Sabine Schormann is to appoint an Artistic Director for the 15th edition of documenta, which is regarded as the most important exhibition of contemporary art in the world.\n\nKassel’s Mayor Christian Geselle, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, expressed pleasure in noting that preparations for documenta 15 are now picking up speed. “documenta is an essential forum for contemporary art and, as the legacy of Arnold Bode, a treasure that enhances the image of the city of Kassel. I am very pleased to note that an international finding commission composed of outstanding experts has been chosen to find an artistic director for documenta 15. And we are right on schedule. I wish to express special thanks to Dr. Sabine Schormann, who has played an instrumental role in preparations for the appointment of members of the Finding Committee, even though she will not officially assume her duties as General Director of documenta und Museum Fridericianum gGmbH in Kassel until 1 November 2018.”\n\nAs Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Hessian Minister of Art and Culture Boris Rhein also expressed thanks to Dr. Sabine Schormann for having made such an important contribution to the process of forming the Finding Commission before taking office as General Director. “We are proud to realize that documenta in Kassel has gained global recognition as one of the most significant and best-known international exhibitions of contemporary art in the world. For the city of Kassel and the state of Hesse, this high honor goes hand in hand with the obligation to ensure that such an ambitious exhibition can be successful in the future as well and that the artistic director chosen by the Finding Commission is equipped with the means to achieve that goal. However, that objective represents both a duty and an incentive for the future artistic director as well. documenta is ideally suited for the purpose of learning from history and thus enabling us to look with courage to the future.”\n\n“In view of the members’ expertise, their extensive network of ties within the cosmos of contemporary art and their different artistic and curatorial approaches, I am confident that the Finding Commission will succeed in appointing an outstanding curator to the position of Artistic Director by early next year,” said Dr. Sabine Schormann. “Personally, I am very eager to see where the journey takes us and whether documenta 15 will be more concerned with such issues as sharing and participation, intercultural networking, performance and discourse, the role of digital media or our approach to the use of public space – to name only a few conceivable focal points of interest.”\n\nBrief biographies of the members of the Finding Commission:\n\nUte Meta Bauer (*Stuttgart, 1958)\n\nUte Meta Bauer has served as an international curator and professor of contemporary art and as the founding Director of the Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) in Singapore since 2013.
