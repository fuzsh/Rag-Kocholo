        "text": "Abstract\n\n‘Cinema is the most powerful weapon’ – Benito Mussolini’s motto loomed in capital letters over the 1937 inauguration of the massive production hub being built in the outskirts of Rome, reminding the film industry what was expected of it. Notwithstanding the effort to deploy cinema as a key technology for governing the nation and the empire, in the early 1940s film became a battlefield for the Regime. This essay excavates from the closet of memory the story of the Cinema cell, the group of young film enthusiasts who, in fascist Italy, engaged in what today we would call ‘media activism’: they put their lives on the line, infiltrated the film industry, and shouldered the movie camera as their initial weapon of combat against a defiant regime. I focus on how the underground formation elaborated an iteration of filmic realism that countered the implantation in the body politic of racialized fantasies of national identity. In tracing the cell’s efforts to develop a gaze on the nation that would oppose the race-driven realism advocated by Mussolini’s son Vittorio, among others, I establish a genealogy for Visconti’s 1943 Ossessione and its display of queerness as the authentic alternative to fascist life. By way of conclusion, I disentangle the system of intimacy and affectivity harnessed by this film from the one that postwar neorealism contributed to securing.\n\nIn his essay ‘Sex in the cinema’, David Forgacs argues that the sociosexual imaginary in Ossessione (Luchino Visconti, 1943) is rife with ‘reactionary elements’ and that there is ‘nothing intrinsically anti-fascist’ in the film’s plotline.1 While it is true that Visconti’s debut shares some narrative and tonal components with other films from late fascist Italy, his unauthorized adaptation of James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice also challenges the general conventions of cinema under the regime. La peccatrice/The Sinful Woman (Amleto Palermi, 1940) Addio, giovinezza!/Goodbye Youth! (Ferdinando Maria Poggioli, 1940) or Quattro passi tra le nuvole/Four Steps in the Cloud (Alessandro Blasetti, 1943) do depict sexual transgression, but only to stage the return to the gendered norms of tradition as the best route ahead for a people who had lost their way. In Ossessione, on the other hand, the chance for salvation comes in the guise of a radical withdrawal from traditional, fascist-sanctioned values, suggesting that in order to truly move forward, the country had to change its ways of life. Building on Antonio Gramsci’s treatment of fascism as a relational system embedded in petit-bourgeois desires and aspirations, this essay reconstructs how Ossessione sought to queer the nation – to disrupt the melodramatic attachment that bound the people to Mussolini and to promote the constitution of a nonconforming body politic.\n\nIn their recent book, Queer Cinema in the World, Rosalind Galt and Karl Schoonover have expanded the boundaries of queer cinema by mapping oppositional figurations of desire and community, of the intimate and the public, across a number of contemporary world locations. For the authors, what makes a film queer is its antinormative ambition to articulate an experience of reality that knocks dominant phenomenologies off kilter and forges dissident horizons ‘of affiliation, affection, affect, and form’.2 My take on Ossessione translates Galt and Schoonover’s framework from cinema’s geography to its history – not to draft a linear evolution of LGBTQ+ filmmaking, but rather to recapitulate some ‘best practices’ in queer cinematic resistance. From this perspective I am keen to highlight how the hybrid transnational aesthetics mobilized in Ossesione upset the gendered borders of the ethno-nation and advance the adoption of ‘foreign’ lifestyles.\n\nYet in order to fully appreciate Ossessione’s originality and substantiate an antifascist reading of its transgressive system of figuration, one must pause to consider the context of struggle from which the film emerged. Ossessione was not merely the brilliant debut of a great auteur; nor, contrary to what André Bazin’s genealogy of neorealism might suggest, did it sprout spontaneously and organically from the rotting corpse of Italian totalitarianism.3 No Italian film, writes Ennio Di Nolfo, ‘was more calculated, more conceptualized, more prepared and consequently less spontaneous’.4Ossessione was a highly mediated work that constituted the final operation of the so-called Cinema cell – the communist formation that had infiltrated the eponymous journal and that had been involved in a conspiracy against the regime since 1941, initially deploying its opposition to fascism through a series of essays advocating for a new Italian realism. At the time it was easy for readers to hear the roar of battle in Cinema’s call for a paradigm shift in the way national reality was captured on film and exhibited on screen. Yet the precise import of the interventions that built up to Ossessione remains largely underexplored.\n\nFor the most part, Italian and anglophone scholarship frames the new realism elaborated in Cinema – and to some degree Ossessione itself – as an anticipation of what Millicent Marcus defines as ‘neorealism proper’.5 Keeping in mind Tom Gunning’s warnings against the normative tendency to treat previous moments in film history as preparatory periods or seed-beds for later ‘classical’ styles and practices, what might be learned about the new realism, strategized in the Cinema journal and then practised in Ossessione, once we stop reviewing it in light of postwar neorealism? Rather than reading Cinema’s intervention in Italy’s mediascape as a transitional step towards a proper, and properly Italian, national cinema to come, I approach it as an aesthetic-political rupture whose originality attests to the political multiplicity and malleability of filmic realism well beyond the Bazin–Baudry ‘divide’. Important essays by William Van Watson and Giuliana Minghelli have traced Ossessione’s exceptionality within Italian popular culture of the time; by neglecting the film’s complex genealogy, however, they miss crucial elements of the Cinema operation.6\n\nThe first section of this essay investigates how the Cinema cell’s contributions on realism countered the implantation in the body politic of racialized fantasies of national identity. In this case I distinguish the weaponization of the cinema proposed by Maurizio Rava (the Governor of Somalia) and Vittorio Mussolini (the Duce’s son) from the deployment put forth by Visconti, Mario Alicata and Giuseppe De Santis. In the second section I focus on Ossessione’s display of queerness as the most viable alternative to fascist life, considering how the film reflects the earlier elaboration of a new national gaze. On paper, the cell had posited that a cinema aspiring to realism could not shy away from showcasing the nation’s potential to become other. Ossessione’s complex metonymic structures give audiovisual substance to such a horizon of change, showing that a happy life, a life beyond fascism, implicates relational and affective registers incompatible with the order of ethnonationalism. At a time when digitally powered movements re-establish race and ethnicity as key political categories, and present, both anxiously and nostalgically, the return to a traditional way of life as the solution to sociopolitical tensions, the Cinema queer conspiracy against fascism perhaps merits closer attention.\n\nAlthough fascism’s rise to power dates back to 1922, fascist narrative cinema did not emerge until several years later. Only in the early 1930s did Mussolini take notice of feature film, turning his attention to charting the rebirth of domestic cinema and exerting control over a struggling film industry through political and financial pressure. James Hay signals how the regime’s late-blossoming interest in commercial filmmaking draws attention to the essential link between government and media, power and leisure, that will define fascism’s totalitarian acceleration.7 In fact, as Victoria de Grazia describes, after ten years of brutal authoritarianism, quashing dissidence and forcing people to submit to Mussolini’s command, the regime started exploring ways to enable more profound and lasting changes in the population’s behaviours and attitudes.8 It is in the context of renewed totalitarian nation-building that fascism colonized free time, and cinema in particular. In this same context one can also situate the move away from escapism and the turn towards realism in Italian film culture.\n\nFascism’s investment in film coincided with a lively paratextual debate in magazines and technical journals that formalized a proper use of the cinematographic apparatus. Such deep reflection on film forms, techniques and technologies constituted an effort both to reckon with the medium’s specificity and to unpack how cinema might best serve the regime’s collective human reclamation (the bonifica).9 Instead of merely distracting the public from the dreariness of daily life, fascism wanted film to become a key technology for geopolitical mediation and internal domination. Realism was recognized as the most apt register to achieve such goals. As Ruth Ben-Ghiat and Marie-France Courriol have both shown, the task that realism was assigned in late fascist visual culture was to publicize the essential traits of the fascist people through a non-rhetorical display of how ‘true Italians’ lived, loved and died.10 Taking a cue from Fredric Jameson’s cryptically titled essay ‘The existence of Italy’, one might speculate that through realism the regime meant to circulate a truth about Italian reality that would assure the smooth reproduction of the fascist nation even after the death of its ageing founding father.11\n\nThe recognition of realism’s influence on collective life brought with it a high degree of anxiety. Given films’ power to affect the people, it was deemed vital to ensure they did not promote unhealthy sentiments within the population. In light of this quasi-paternalistic rhetoric, it is fitting that the vice-governor of Tripolitania and former governor of Somalia was invited to pen the very first article in the authoritative film journal Cinema, published in 1936. In ‘The African peoples in front of the screen’, Maurizio Rava established a connection between film and the supremacy of the white race, instructing national cinema on how to represent interactions between Italians and their colonial subjects. Preoccupied by the cross-racial contacts in the recently proclaimed fascist empire, Rava singles out miscegenation as the most urgent issue of the day. Fascism’s settler colonialism and its plans for world domination needed more bodies, hence Mussolini’s ‘battle for births’; yet it was paramount that these new lives were of the ‘right’ kind. Rava exhorts filmmakers to abandon the exoticism characterizing an earlier moment in the representation of colonial domains in order to avoid arousing improper desires in the public.12 It was not only a question of preventing illicit forms of attachment from penetrating the homeland, it was also a matter of controlling which image of Italy reached the colonies. To ensure the ‘prestige of the white race’ – according to Rava a fundamental component of imperial domination – colonial administrators were to block the release of films that might compromise the fearful respect held by local populations for ‘benevolent’ Italian masters and their women. The people of Somalia, Ethiopia and Libya were as impressionable as children, he declared; one needed, accordingly, to be very sensitive to how images affected the coloured public and refrain from feeding them pictures that ignited either race antagonism or interracial desires. What is notable about this first article published in Cinema is the precision with which it connects the realms of filmic, sexual and social reproduction. As Ann Stoler affirms, the modern policing of sexuality and the order of state racism are structurally intertwined.13 For Rava, the ways that bodies are represented in the cinema ought to be severely regulated, lest the supremacy and purity of the Italian race, and thus of the ethnic nation, be compromised both at the heart and at the margins of the empire.\n\nA similar concern for a correct visualization of Italian reality also characterizes the interventions in Cinema by Vittorio Mussolini, who had become the journal’s editor-in-chief in 1939. In the editorial ‘Discipline and order’, the Duce’s son encourages producers, directors and screenwriters to docilely accept fascism’s ‘attentive scrutiny’ and ‘friendly assistance’. In ‘Italian race and Italian cinema’, he further details how national film can assist the totalitarian regime.14 Mussolini first laments the lack of realism in current Italian cinema; he then affirms that for national cinema to be realistic, it should exhibit the racial unity of the Italian people. More specifically, he presses Cinecittà to follow Hollywood in its treatment of films as natural emanations of the body politic. Motion pictures convey the nation. Therefore, Mussolini urges, directors should cast only actors and actresses whose bodies affirm the Italian race in all its glorious beauty and physical prowess. In fact, no matter how different from one another Italians might look, they must be recognized as sharing one race and one destiny on the basis of their common heritage.\n\nIn Vittorio Mussolini’s eyes, fascism had successfully identified the most fundamental traits of Italian culture and civilization: a common historical background, a shared lineage going back to a phantasmatic Romanitas, defined what the body politic was and could be. And it was precisely the spiritual-biological homogeneity of the Italian people that cinema had to manifest if it aspired, as it should, to realism: ‘We are not talking here about comedies or detective stories, but of plots that mirror Italian life as it is in these years: intense, active, catapulted towards an imperial dimension’.15 Rural yet modern, poor yet courageous, heroic, young, lively, self-confident, exuberant and audacious – this was the essence of the Italian people that a proper national cinema had to record and broadcast. By making the nation more recognizable and reputable abroad, cinema would contribute to the affirmation of the Italian race on the world stage. Moreover, in a time of the homeland’s transnational expansion, a realistic representation of the fascist race would make the citizenry – wherever they resided – proud of their heritage, and thus inspire them to enthusiastically fulfil their manifest biological destiny. As Ernesto Laclau explains, the reference to race in fascist rhetoric has a twofold function: it naturalizes history and forecloses futurity by grafting national identity onto an overdetermined patrimony; it neutralizes conflict by recoding all differences within the country as merely somatic and happenstance variables of the same archetypal matrix.16\n\nDespite all the endeavours to enlist cinema in fascism’s totalitarian laboratory, from the early 1940s onwards film turned into a battlefield for the regime. After years of relative consensus, the harsh reality of World War II constituted a great blow to Mussolini’s capacity to keep the country and its film industry in check. Even directors sympathetic to the regime, such as Roberto Rossellini and Augusto Genina, had difficulties bringing to the screen the great and perfect Italy concocted by fascism. Additionally there were conscious efforts to weaponize cinema in the fight against fascist command. With the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, fascism had created a public state-of-the-art facility that produced skilled screenwriters, cinematographers and directors. This very training made it possible for film practitioners to navigate the intricate censorship system, experiment with film norms and elaborate new ways of using the apparatus. Thanks in particular to its co-founder Umberto Barbaro, the film school had become ‘the foreign legion of anti-fascist intelligentsia’.17 Ironically it was Vittorio Mussolini himself who introduced Visconti to this cohort of young filmmakers who, in fascist Italy, engaged in what today we would call ‘media activism’: they infiltrated the film industry, put their lives on the line, and shouldered the movie camera as their initial weapon of combat against a defiant regime.\n\nMussolini’s heir was a passionate admirer of Jean Renoir, and in 1939 he invited the French director to Rome to adapt Tosca.18 Renoir, however, fled the country when Italy declared war on France, leaving his young assistant Luchino behind to complete the project. Vittorio Mussolini introduced Visconti to the editors at Cinema, a journal that under his lax tenure had become a think-tank for young Italians whose discontent with fascism was ever-growing. The thirty-three-year-old Visconti promptly fraternized with Cinema’s leftist editors, including Giuseppe De Santis and Mario Alicata. Both in their twenties and members of the banned Communist Party, De Santis and Alicata were already pondering ways to intertwine art and political activism in the same fashion as Renoir had done in the France of the Popular Front. In Visconti they recognized someone who, with his experience, connections and wealth, could assist their efforts. At that point, the Cinema cell was established. Alongside Visconti, future Academy Award-winner De Santis, and future cultural leader of the Italian Communist Party Alicata, the group included soon-to-be directors Antonio Pietrangeli and Carlo Lizzani, Gianni and Dario Puccini, Jewish novelist Alberto Moravia, and Pietro Ingrao, who in 1976 would become the first communist to chair the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Several members of the cell were monitored by the secret police, and Alicata and the Puccini brothers even had files in the political registry of antifascist activities.19\n\nThe merits of a ‘politicization of aesthetics’ that would oppose Nazi-fascism’s ‘aestheticization of politics’ were being assessed not only in Germany and Vichy France but also in Italy. In contrast to Nazi Germany, in Italy there were still venues where dissent from official cultural politics could be voiced. It was not out of liberality that fascism allowed these spaces to persist; they might more precisely be thought of as relief valves intended to keep tabs on any unrest and redirect it. On the basis of such a situation, the strategy dictated by the underground Communist Party was to cautiously occupy these ostensible free-speech zones in order to delegitimize state-sponsored cultural forms, articulate new discursive orders, and establish communication with other potential freedom fighters. This strategy appears as an iteration of what Gramsci describes as a ‘war of position’, a political struggle that takes place within the realm of collective phantasy, with the goal of establishing an alternative national popular culture that will pave the way to armed insurrection.20 In the case of the Cinema cell, the entry-point into this cultural war was the debate on filmic realism.\n\nFrom the interwar period onwards, and all the way to Vittorio Mussolini, the debate on realism was a site of power/knowledge struggle between conflicting accounts of national reality with radically different political implications.21 ‘Realism’ constituted a fraught term in Italian culture, functioning as a sort of empty signifier that could be appropriated by groups with differing agendas to advance their own politically motivated world views. De Santis, Alicata and Visconti did the same: they took a stance on the issue of realism in film in order to elaborate a perspective on the nation, a political project and a deployment of the medium that were all incompatible with those formalized in fascist circles. The antifascist dimension of their new realism emerges for the first time in De Santis’s 1941 ‘Towards an Italian landscape’.22\n\nDe Santis starts his programmatic manifesto – the ‘towards’ in the title should not be overlooked – by repeating the claims that Vittorio Mussolini and others had made repeatedly in Cinema: real Italian people were missing from cinemas; realism had not yet been achieved; Italian film needed to achieve realism. However, the brilliant student from the Centro Sperimentale swerves away from cliched positions and instead questions the necessity of holding on to the master-trope of ‘race’ as the ultimate truth about the nation.\n\nIn ‘Italian race and Italian cinema’, Vittorio Mussolini demanded that cinema capture Italians as one race and one people. He insisted that\n\nthe somatic differences among Italians, the differences which distinguish the blond from the brown, differences of skin colour and skull shape, do not prevent us from agreeing with illustrious scientists and asserting the existence of one Italian race that includes all Italians, from the Alps to Sicily.23\n\nDe Santis obliquely signals that Mussolini’s magic formula for achieving realism in film was ill conceived, because he had completely failed to understand what Italian identity is all about. Not only did Italians look different, they were different from each other, insofar as their fundamental imprint came from their surroundings and not from a common spiritual-biological patrimony:\n\nWe are surely saying nothing new by claiming that the landscape in which each of us was born and has lived contributed to making us different from one another. And herein lies God’s mark, which we are unfortunately accustomed to seeing profaned to such an extent that a peasant from Sicily can appear identical to one living in the Julian Alps.24\n\nAlthough De Santis never mentions race, it is still the main focus of his article. In fact ‘Towards an Italian landscape’ can be described as an exploration of the irrelevance of race when it comes to understanding, and thus representing, the nation. As De Santis would reiterate in the sensuous prose of his ‘The language of relations’, what human beings hold within themselves, ‘they have stolen from their elements, from their relations, from their peculiar ways of being in communion with others, from the tree that grows in their gardens or from the passers-by they have briefly encountered in the streets’.25 A person does not live in the world as a silkworm enclosed in its shell: she is surrounded by comrades, animals, gardens, streets, mountains, the sky, a sea and life. For this reason filmmakers interested in capturing Italy had no other option than narrating the diverse milieux constitutive of the country – situating, as Renoir did, their plots against the backdrop of actual environs. Otherwise Italian cinema would confine itself to staged depictions of Italy, visualizations that bore no trace of the radical differences between Sicilians and people from the Alps, for instance. Two important consequences follow from De Santis’s argument: first, notwithstanding fascism’s presumed reclamation of the country, a unified national reality did not exist – national life was radically diverse; and second, the Italian nation that realism ought to propagate was not a racially homogenous people but rather a fragmentary space inhabited by multiplicity of different lives.\n\nWith the landscape as a backdrop, not only did Italy look diverse, it also appeared precarious. Noa Steimatsky cogently characterizes De Santis’s interventions on realism as an exploration of Italian locations that upset the spatial mythology of a centralized ethnic community.26 I would add that the Cinema cell’s emphasis on Italian diversity challenges also the temporal order of ethnonationalism, summoning a different experience of history, a contingent temporality at odds with the idea of biological destiny. Indeed, what happens to our conception of history when we are reminded that the landscape – the force informing who we are, according to De Santis – is partially our own creation? If the form that life acquires is the result of a nondeterministic interaction between group and environment, then by acting on the environment a social block also acts upon itself. This means that identities are always in a state of becoming, open to negotiation; it means that the future of the nation is not beyond the reach of its citizens. Consequently, for De Santis, an authentically new Italian realism would need to capture the transformative dialogue that people engage in with one another and with their surroundings.\n\nThe protagonist of Vittorio Mussolini’s realism was a homogenous people captive to an overdetermined fate; De Santis, by contrast, evoked a country with an open-ended history. With an ecocritical sensibility derived from his peasant origins, De Santis characterized the nation as a changing organism, a contingent and unstable space crawling with life, differences, passions, energy, possibilities and futurity. In so doing he also devised a cinema that, instead of reproducing the fascist nation, would upset what habitually passed for realistic at the cinema.27 In reality, Italians were not a race and did not have a destiny; in reality, there was no pure ethnic community for fascism to police, secure and defend in the first place.\n\n‘Towards an Italian landscape’ was only the inception of Cinema’s attack against the hegemonic representations of Italian reality. The group soon took aim at the ‘calligraphic’ style in national cinema in a way that resonated with the French New Wave’s rejection of professionalism and the cinéma du papa. It also echoed Roman Jakobson’s considerations on how revolutionary forms of realism in art establish themselves in dialectical opposition to previous works, which are denounced as insufficient both in terms of form and content.28 The Cinema cell’s issue with domestic cinema was that its obsession with stylistic perfection had resulted in a failure to feature the Italian people who really mattered. In their 1941 article, ‘Truth and poetry: Verga and Italian cinema’, Alicata and De Santis ridicule the staged, superficial, sterile, provincial, polished pictorialism of recent Italian films, which monumentalize the most trivial details of national life and present them as the ultimate truth about the country.29 Yet surprisingly, given the unmediated dimension one usually associates with neorealism, they state that a lot of preparation is necessary in order to eschew trite representational paradigms. Taking a stance, as Barbaro had done earlier, against the mystical trust in the movie camera’s capacity to capture the real by means of technical reproduction alone, Alicata and De Santis argue that filmmakers should widen their horizons and expand their frames of reference before scouting ports, fields and factories. Before even thinking of taking their cameras to the streets, directors and screenwriters should read the Southern ‘verist’ writer Giovanni Verga.30\n\nThe reference to Verga’s tales of Sicilian life had contentious overtones. As Steimatsky notes, the island represented a space and a time that ‘seemed hardly adequate to the desired image of a centralized, modern, imperially ambitious fascist Italy as it was entering the war’.31 This territory was not only at the margins of the nation geographically, but also linguistically, culturally, politically and historically. With his novellas, Verga contributed to branding Sicily as a space of difference, a remnant of otherness difficult to assimilate into a unified national order. Whereas for the regime Sicily was a problem (‘the Southern question’), for the Cinema cell it constituted an answer, a resource to excite the collective imagination. The people memorialized by Verga approximated prerevolutionary subjects fighting for freedom from oppression and exploitation. His tales about humble Sicilian workers (fishermen, peasants, miners) limned suffering yet combative social groups bravely engaged in changing their life-worlds, bearing witness to a reality that was resilient to fascism’s projected reclamation and normalization of national life.32 In essence, the Cinema cell believed that Verga’s subaltern people were the protagonists of a history that had nothing to do with the racialized destiny that, according to the fascist establishment, cinema had to manifest. Verga’s Sicilians were the heroes that Italian popular culture lacked; they were fighters, but not cut from an imperial cloth.33 Ultimately, the Cinema cell hoped that Verga would open filmmakers’ eyes to this other history taking place at the nation’s margins, causing them to reorient their cameras away from a fascist middle class towards antagonistic Italians and forcing them to take notice of overlooked fractures, frictions and tensions within the country. Alicata and De Santis admit that Sicily will mean nothing to those interested in cinematic awards or technical perfection. Yet to those ‘who believe in an art which above all creates truth’, Verga indicates the one historically valid urgency: ‘the urgency of a revolutionary art inspired by a humanity that suffers and hopes’.34\n\nThe proposal for a new realism committed to representing the lives and struggles of these other Italians – a realism that would create a new truth regime and have spectators experience the nation’s time-space differently – did not go unnoticed. A few weeks after the publication of De Santis and Alicata’s first article on Verga and Italian film, a vitriolic intervention in Cinema protested that cinema was a medium of immediacy and that literature had no place at the movies.35 There was no deeper truth to be discovered beneath the fascist ordering of things – no struggle, no tension, no violence, no underground conflicts, hopes, aspirations or unexplored potentialities. Italy’s truth was immediately available to anyone who cared to record it, and thus there was no need for directors to re-view the country through Verga’s lens.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Alicata and De Santis’s intervention provoked panic and indignation. ‘Truth and poetry’ implied that what passed for Italian reality on the screen was a lie; it held that cinema failed to grasp the truth about the nation, despite its self-proclaimed accuracy. In one fell swoop, the Cinema cell delegitimized the regime’s entire filmic imaginary and – given the complicity of media and power since the early 1930s – fascism itself. If films that narrated a suffering yet pugnacious humanity were more authentically realistic than those representing an imperial, united, happy, active, disciplined Italian race, then the foundations of fascist ideology were suddenly undermined. As Visconti was soon to reiterate, the truth about Italy, the truth about the Italian people and the nation’s possibilities, could be accessed only through the literary topos of Sicily.\n\nIn his essay ‘Corpses’, Visconti extended the polemic initiated by De Santis’s ‘Towards an Italian landscape’, denouncing the comatose state of Italian cinema and the appalling consequences of state control over film production. The industry, Visconti warned, was in the hands of corpses who, unaware of being dead, insisted on writing screenplays.36 In ‘Tradition and invention’, Visconti singles out Verga as the author who could steer the film industry past the ‘banality and […] misery typical of current scenarios’.37 Visconti emphatically recalls that reading Verga led him to realize how much less docile Italy was than he previously believed. The Sicily one could read about in I Malavoglia/The House by the Medlar Tree (1890) was physically and symbolically alien to the Italy usually exhibited in the cinema. Verga’s Sicily thereby functioned metonymically as an alternative reality through which Visconti could see that, beyond the bourgeois life so often represented in the movies, there was another people waiting to be discovered, a life-world characterized by a different iteration of heroism, by fervid passions, epic adventures and violent conflicts. Visconti essentially pointed to Sicily as a means of escaping the hollow promises and premises of fascist modernity, a return to the ‘core feature of human life’, as he puts it.\n\nIn letters sent from prison after being arrested for his antifascist activities, Alicata raised doubts about Visconti’s fascination with Sicily: he was afraid that Visconti might be indulging in primitivist phantasies about Southerness similar to those informing F. W. Murnau’s Tabu: A Story of the South Seas (1931). Dispelling charges of what today we would call essentialism and antihistoricism, in ‘Anthropomorphic cinema’ – an essay announcing Ossessione’s release to the public – Visconti clarifies that a cinema that captures humanity’s essential features is a cinema that bears witness to life’s potential to evolve.38 For Visconti, the core of human life is not to be found in an atemporal essence but rather in the ‘mystical discovery’ that although one is not well, one could do better: no matter how corrupt individuals are, they still have a chance to repent and to reform their lives. This empowering self-awareness, according to Visconti, is precisely what Ossessione strived to muster. However, the film did not merely reiterate that Italians could improve their situation and change, and that national identity was not overdetermined by tradition or race but instead coincided with an openness towards the future that the nation had, for its own sake, to pursue. Through its laboured metonymic structures, the final act of the Cinema conspiracy against the regime charted more clearly the ‘lines of flight’ on which people had to embark in order to travel beyond fascism.\n\nOssessione, I will now show, dislodged the fascist nation by raising a host of fundamental political questions. What if, in order to overcome barbarism, the people had to reject fascism’s affective regime and fight instead for different configurations of polity and desire? What if becoming-other, symbolically and physically going-elsewhere, stood as the country’s only opportunity for salvation from the destructive normality harnessed by the regime? What would it mean if the ‘model citizen’ was not a middle-class business-owner or an imperial fighter, but rather a queer, transnational communist? What if the real Italian woman was not a caring wife and mother but a disenfranchised dancer?\n\nBy spring 1943 the tide had turned against fascism. While Stalin’s Red Army pushed back on the Eastern Front, the Allies had taken Tunisia, putting them just a few short miles south of Sicily. Workers’ strikes in Turin and Milan were unmistakable signs of an expanding unrest in the North. Fascist Italy was under siege. Mussolini was losing control of his country, his people and his party. It was at this historic juncture that Ossessione was released.\n\nBarbaro was enthusiastic, coining the term ‘neorealism’ to describe the film’s attempt to capture and change national reality, but he was among the few who praised Ossessione. The Minister of Popular Culture denounced it as ‘reeking of latrines’, and conservative critics dismissed it as a crass representation of national life – a deplorable imitation of what they saw as the coarse cinema of Marcel Carné and Jean Renoir. In the midst of such an unprecedented smear campaign, the police so discouraged cinema managers from screening Visconti’s work that very few filmgoers could actually see it. Vittorio Mussolini did catch the work that had originated in his editorial office; he did not like it one bit.39 ‘This is not Italy! This is not Italy! This is not Italy!’, he allegedly protested, storming out of Ossessione’s private premiere. He was right in failing to recognize his nation in the country that the film depicted. Ossessione was truly anti-Italian, and not merely from a formal point of view, in its endeavour to bring together American noir, French naturalism and Italian verismo by shooting a melodrama on location. Ossessione was an anti-Italian work because the people it portrayed were incompatible with those that fascism produced and those it demanded that cinema reproduce. If, as the film maintained, twenty years after Mussolini’s rise to power, the nation remained a moral swamp dominated by toxic affects, then perhaps the problem was not simply the Duce or fascist rule; it might lie instead in the belief that the return to the core values of Italian tradition would save the people. In this sense, the Cinema cell did far more than denounce the degradation of national life, blame Mussolini for it, and advocate for a change in leadership – as happened in Il cappello a tre punte/Three Cornered Hat (Mario Camerini, 1935).\n\nOssessione indicted fascism as the culmination of a longer trajectory and suggested that redemption could only be found in the desertion of traditional arrangements of intimate and social life. While fascism invested in film as a means of policing the people’s affects and behaviours, the Cinema group deployed the medium as an apparatus of disidentification, harnessing new ways of orienting oneself in national space and national history.\n\nGino (Massimo Girotti) is a drifter. Homeless and jobless, he arrives at a roadside inn owned by the old Bragana (Juan de Landa) and his young wife Giovanna (Clara Calamai) and is given work. During his stay, Gino and Giovanna fall for each other. Giovanna is seeking a partner to enact her murderous plan to kill Bragana, pocket his hefty life insurance, take over the inn, and start a new home and family. Gino hesitates between choosing to return to his fancy-free existence on the road or to embrace the home life with which Giovanna entices him. The outsiders Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo) and Anita (Dhia Cristiani) give Gino refuge in the cities of Ancona and Ferrara, urging him not to succumb to the lure of domesticity or the hegemonic notions of sex, gender and family. But in the end Gino cannot resist Giovanna. He murders Bragana, only to find himself arrested and Giovanna killed.\n\nThe effort by Cinema to conjure the nation’s darker side is already foreshadowed by Ossessione’s opening sequence. Over a melodramatic soundscape and through the frame of a truck windscreen, the viewer is exposed to a grim and desolate Po Valley – nothing like the enchanted countryside showcased in an analogous opening shot from Blasetti’s concurrent Quattro passi tra le nuvole (figures 1 and 2).\n\nThe people who inhabit the Italian countryside are as desolate as the environment: a couple with no children and out of love; an ex-soldier turned Blackshirt, turned abusive husband, inept business owner and kitten killer; an ex-prostitute who orchestrates the death of the man who rescued her from the streets and then relegated her to the status of housemaid; a hobo with no reservations about sleeping with a married woman and killing her husband. Peter Brooks famously argued that the cinematic removal of house-tops and the representation of the sad family existences playing out beneath them is a typical gesture of any narrative that strives to establish itself as realistic.40 Within the context of Italian fascism, the Cinema cell’s reframing of domestic life acquires a particular valence.\n\nExpanding on Gramsci’s interpretation of the regime as a mass organization of the petite bourgeoisie, in the 1960s cultural theorist Furio Jesi argued that the domus – the elements of peace provided by home and family – are not merely metaphors in fascist rhetoric but constitute the very Italian thrust of Mussolini’s myths of national rebirth. Underlying pompous fantasies about empires and colonies, about race and destiny and Romanitas, and about making the Mediterranean a mare nostrum again, Jesi recognizes the securitarian fixation with constructing a ‘microcosm in which all social relations reveal the presence of extremely solid walls: those of the home, the family-run company, the city’.41 With his analysis of fascism, Jesi anticipates the conclusions later reached by the historian Emilio Gentile: Mussolini’s regime constituted a panic-ridden counter-revolution seeking to reclaim a conventional way of life at a time when the homeland was being unsettled by a rampant transnational flow of goods, bodies, imaginaries, ideas and intimacies. Keeping in mind the central preoccupation with ‘home’ in Italian culture, Ossessione’s bleak depiction of family life stands out as a provocative disruption of the national obsession with tranquil domesticity on which fascism capitalized. What is, in fact, this longed-for home? What is this place for which one should sacrifice everything? For Ossessione, it is the time-space of melodrama.\n\nIn Visconti: Insights into Flesh and Blood, Alexander García Düttmann argues that Visconti’s melodramas are characterized by an aesthetics of excess that explodes the stable identity of the viewers and pushes them to feel another potential life pulsing beyond the life that is merely possible in the here and now – a life, as Jonathan Goldberg puts it, ‘beyond the legal, the social, the rules of existence’.42 In a 2017 lecture delivered in Berlin, Düttmann returned to the topic, pausing on the weird bursts of laughter in Visconti’s later films, most notably Morte a Venezia/Death in Venice (1971). For Düttmann these outbursts manifest how melodrama in general, and Visconti’s films in particular, trigger a charged emotional register culminating in a queer jouissance, wherein any fixed arrangement of subjectivity is compromised.43\n\nIn Ossessione – an example of ‘melodramatic realism’ for Henry Bacon – there is no trace of that liberating pathos that Düttmann and Goldberg, in an almost Bataillean fashion, deem central to Visconti’s queer utopianism.44 By using melodrama to read Italian history and by conjuring the melodramatic dimension of national reality, Ossessione resorts to the system of light, colour, sound and music typical of the register to achieve two goals. On the one hand, through this affected aesthetic Visconti highlights the powerful hold of the Italian dream of domesticity – the overwrought camera movements and emphatic soundscape that pull Gino towards Giovanna’s home space at the beginning of the film. On the other hand, the melodramatic chronotopes of an immutable world in which individuals are hostage to pathological passions and victims of an irreversible temporality are mobilized to show how the compulsion towards normality and ‘the home’ entails an affective blockage, a compromised system of attachment, a rush of longing and yearning that immunizes history from change.\n\nIn ‘Truth and poetry’ De Santis and Alicata advise that in order to avoid fatalism and defeatism, cinema had to map the presence throughout the nation of alternatives to the fascist ordering of things. In Ossessione the urban landscapes of Ancona and Ferrara – where Gino enjoys time with the street artist Spagnolo and the ballerina Anita, respectively – stand out as audiovisual counterpoints to the melodramatic existence in the rural home, providing important glimmers of the unexplored futures available to the Italian people. Ossessione’s Ancona and Ferrara are spaces of redemptive encounters, exuberant vitality, light and lightness; localities where the poor benefit from a system of alliance and support that is not based on labour exchange or on the exploitative tutelage of the upper class but on mutual assistance; an example of that parallel welfare structure embedded, for Carlo Vercellone, in Italian libertarian Marxism.45 In these cities, the film suggests, people invite you into their bedrooms and share their meagre supplies with you out of love and solidarity, not for any ulterior motive. The person of colour present in Ancona and the two disabled people walking around Ferrara attest to how the landscapes in which Spagnolo and Anita move are spaces of difference, not of the white ableist body politic prized by Vittorio Mussolini. Neither does the rhythm to which these localities move hew to Italian nationalism. When Giovanna, in Ferrara, tries to entice Gino with her tales of family life and upward social mobility, he is distracted by the diegetic upbeat music playing in the background and walks away from her to join Anita – whose demeanour was modelled on Picasso’s cubist portraits, while Giovanna’s references the Italian Modigliani.46 Expanding on Giuliana Minghelli’s insightful account of how the Cinema film shifts gears whenever Gino disconnects from the fantasies of domesticity, normalcy and heterosexuality that Giovanna represents, I hold that the opposition between urban and country lifestyles in the film is more than a displacement of Visconti’s closeted homosexual desires. It is the crucial element for understanding Ossessione’s queer interweaving of politics and sexuality.47\n\nAfter they make love for the first time, Gino offers Giovanna a conch shell in which she can hear the echo of the ocean, seducing her with the unbound life that the sea, borderless and always in motion, evokes. Giovanna seems to be convinced and she agrees to desert the inn with Gino. But a few metres on the road are enough to make her waver; her old life has a gravity that tugs her backward in time. Whereas on the road Gino perceives glimpses of another possible existence, Giovanna is paralysed in her life-world, burdened by the weight of tradition and the fear of losing social status. She sits down on a mound of gravel (figure 3). Gino sits down with her, and the camera, in a high-angle shot, embeds them in the backdrop, where a group of peasants is working in a rudimentary wheat-threshing ritual.\n\nAs De Santis recalls in an essay penned in honour of Ossessione’s fortieth anniversary, the background in this sequence is paramount to advancing the film’s perspective. Firstly it signals how the two lovers, by aborting their escape plan, would be confined to an archaic existence of toil and labour. Moreover, being modelled on Brueghel the Elder’s painting The Harvesters (figure 4), the sfondo was also designed to lift the representation of national life from its provincialism and couch it in wider networks of figuration.48 The reference to transnational cultural affiliations continues in the reverse-shot: Gino stands up and walks away, hitting the road without hesitation or fear in a shot that formally and tonally alludes to the endings of Charlie Chaplin’s The Tramp (1915) and Modern Times (1936). As a femme fatale, Giovanna allegorically flags the tragic fate the nation will endure if it does not abandon its ways of living and loving, and it is expected that as soon as Gino cuts his ties with her, his horizon will dramatically change. Now the jobless hobo has an open road and a clear sky in front of him; there is a whole world waiting to be explored. Eve Sedgwick defines queerness as the ‘open mesh of possibilities’ exceeding traditional social relations and entailing an experimentation with modes of intimacy that challenge the models endorsed by dominant discourse.49 It is just such a queer openness that Gino experiences in his oblique existence away from the home melodrama, in his encounters with Spagnolo and Anita, which the film deploys as alternatives to the Italian way of life incarnated by Bragana and Giovanna.\n\nSpagnolo in particular is a key figure for the film’s political imaginary. This character was wholly invented by the Cinema team; he has no analogue in Cain’s novel. As Alicata would later explain, Spagnolo is a proletarian living as a street artist in order to disseminate communism across Italy; he got his nickname from enlisting with the Brigadas Internacionales during the Spanish Civil War.50 In the hotel room that they share on their first night together in Ancona, the camera follows Spagnolo’s eyes as they caress Gino with affection and care. In this scene one witnesses a coding of the male body that upsets state-sponsored machismo (figure 5).\n\nThe tender intimacy here contrasts with the instinctual and animalistic passions that consume Gino and Giovanna, either in the inn’s kitchen, surrounded by dirty dishes and leftovers, or – as Mira Liehm writes – ‘in the bedroom with the always unmade bed whose sheets seem to exhale the odor of unwashed bodies’.51 It is true, as Gilles Deleuze points out, that in Ossessione homosexuality arises as the chance of salvation from the weight of a stifling past.52 Yet it is not merely sex that drives Gino to Spagnolo but the fact that the character’s alternative lifestyle displays a mode of living incompatible with fascism. By depicting Spagnolo as a model Italian who differs radically from the one performed ‘off stage’ by Benito Mussolini and on screen by his less charismatic body-doubles, Ossessione argued that a healthier future for Italy would remain foreclosed until the nation reconsidered its limited conception of living and loving. Spagnolo, and in a less obvious way Anita, conjure in fact all that the regime feared and disavowed: liminality, mobility, dissatisfaction with any stable arrangement of life, ephemerality, disinterest in childbearing and reproductive futurity.\n\nAway from the closed and claustrophobic rural Italy, Gino experiments with a different existence: a life of communality and in common, where the poor look out for each other. In Spagnolo’s company, the sea – an open mesh of possibilities indeed – replaces the barren Po swamplands as a background; the melodramatic gives way to a lyrical representation of the life-world that Gino has joined. In the most emblematic visualization of the message the Cinema cell sought to send to the nation, the camera portrays Gino and Spagnolo looking east towards the Adriatic Sea, silently gazing a horizon full of potential (figure 6). The melody of a diegetic flute confirms a tonal shift introduced by the mise-en-scene, and the low-angle shot rockets Gino and Spagnolo towards the sky. They are propelled towards an open future, turning their back on the authority of tradition, figured here by the San Ciriaco Cathedral, and on the toil of labour, materialized in the construction workers precariously renovating the church’s cupola. A dog, a Blackshirt, two navy sailors, a tramp napping on a bench, a man reading a book, a couple flirting: no one is doing anything in the square in which Gino and Spagnolo are exploring their homosocial camaraderie; it is an empty space filled only with light, the opposite of Bragana’s dark, cluttered inn. Free from work and any social obligation, disconnected from the repetitive temporality of production and reproduction, people are simply enjoying their time. In this situation Gino begins to smile – a smile that feels very different from the outbursts of laughter in Visconti’s later films (figure 7). Düttmann insists that in Visconti’s melodramas the move beyond the present is effected by an intensification of longing and desire, which materializes in moments of uncontrollable jouissance.53 In Ossessione, on the contrary, futurity is accessed through the deactivation of the overblown system of affectivity typical of the melodramatic mode. Gino smiles, for he is free from any form of operatic attachment or investment.\n\nDeleuze’s discussion of the formal innovations introduced by Visconti’s film is relevant here.54 In Cinema 2: The Time-Image, Deleuze claims that Ossessione subtly but radically transformed filmic realism. Previously we had a realism in which characters react almost automatically to the situations they face and to the passions they experience. With Ossessione we encounter a new realism in which characters do not act immediately on reality but instead take their time to consider the situations they encounter in their meandering. The ‘voyage-form’, Deleuze suggests, turns characters into voyants, into seers or clairvoyants, idle visionary beings who gaze upon reality in order to strategize possible new courses of action and systems of passion. This interruption of linear plot progression is not only a matter of film style but also of film politics, since it constitutes, following David Martin-Jones, a challenge to the hegemonic patterns of behaviour that genre cinema, in its different national iterations, contributed to securing. In such a challenge to national narratives and national identities, one needs also to locate the disruptive charge of queer utopianism. As José Esteban Muñoz suggests in his take on Giorgio Agamben, the deactivation of established ways of experiencing the world interrupts the ‘straight’ flow of time and movement, opening up reality and the body to possible new uses.55\n\nWe are now in a position to appreciate the political relevance of the idleness of the lyrical interlude in Ancona. In this suspension of home life, this shift away from the melodramatic, the camera – staying still – takes the time to make the spectator sense what Spagnolo is trying to make Gino see and hear. Spagnolo, who is also a fortune teller by trade, is trying to help his travel companion realize that the future is right in front of him, in the ‘there and then’. What renders Ossessione such an exceptional document in Italian cultural history is the fact that this film sanctions queerness as route to a nonfascist future – hinting at how unconventional forms of intimacy are politically desirable precisely because they sustain less destructive forms of being-together as well as truly revolutionary interpersonal relations. Spagnolo attests to a possible happy life away from authority and the police, a life at sea and on the margins; this is also a life beyond the obsession with normality, a life lived on the basis of a different moral and sexual compass. It is a life beyond melodrama and fascism; beyond the symbolic horizon of Italy’s petit-bourgeois aspiration for a home, a family-owned business, a spouse, some children; beyond the relational system that had undergirded twenty years of dictatorship. Gino, alas, is not brave enough to choose such a life, and turns away from Spagnolo. When he accidentally runs into Bragana and Giovanna in Ancona, he is pulled back to the inn and on the drive there he kills Bragana in a staged car crash. He will have Giovanna to himself after all.\n\nBragana is the character most fond of melodrama in the film. He is constantly singing arias and even wins, triumphant beneath the Italian flag, a talent competition with his performance of Verdi – an author who, with his tales of lost homelands, is crucial to the development of Italian nationalism. After Bragana’s death, Gino and Giovanna start living the existence he sang about, a life where radical change is constantly deferred in the illusory belief that one will eventually find reasons to smile. The longed-for home turns out to be a ghostly space, haunted by the crime committed and the weight of domesticity. Gino and Giovanna do not have particularly bad circumstances: unlike characters in Vittorio De Sica’s postwar films, such as Sciuscià/Shoeshine (1946), Ladri di biciclette/Bicycle Thieves (1948), Miracolo a Milano/Miracle in Milan (1951) or Umberto D. (1953), they have a vehicle, a job, a steady income and even a nice roof over their heads. Their problem is that by choosing an ‘Italian life’, they have committed to a routine where one does nothing but work, eat, sleep and wither away. In a revelatory sequence, the camera – from a high angle – portrays Gino and Giovanna cleaning up after a hard day’s work. They appear nailed to the soil on which they tread, barely able to lift their feet from the ground. Giovanna eats supper alone in a gloomy and untidy kitchen. The deep staging inventories the clutter that surrounds her, conveying an airless atmosphere. Giovanna does realize that the reward for her mind-numbing labour is not a good life but only more junk, more waste, more fatigue and more exhaustion. But she has convinced herself, and Gino, that they need to endure the pain and stay on at the inn, to keep working for a better future. And as Gino accepts his duty ‘guarding the house of a departed’ – as he puts it – the grim reaper appears in the background in the guise of a peasant woman, foreshadowing the absence of a silver lining in the cliched family melodrama that the couple has settled for. Also in the scene is the child worker that Giovanna had taken in as housemaid. While children in postwar neorealism function as signs of hope and progress – the precise trope that Lee Edelman protests56 – here the unnamed child, who betrays her masters by putting the police onto Gino and Giovanna’s trail, figures the endless dialectic of exploitation and revenge that the ‘home’ activates.\n\nWith the police closing in on them, and having discovered that Giovanna is pregnant, the murderous couple finally decide to abandon the inn for good. This move away from their home is radically different from the flight towards adventure that Gino had earlier proposed to Giovanna and experienced with Spagnolo and Anita. The life that Giovanna and Gino are now seeking is not new, but merely another iteration of the life they already have. The repetitive landscape they drive through and the slow-moving truck blocking their route both signal that they are going nowhere. It is too late for them to change. As Gino confessed to Spagnolo, he is tired of travelling, of exploring; he just wants a place to start a family and call home. It is noteworthy that fate strikes precisely as the fantasy of a traditional nuclear family seduces Gino and Giovanna, when they get lost in what Lauren Berlant would describe as a relation of ‘cruel optimism’ – the blindly optimistic attachment to a way of living that has already proven itself unsustainable and destructive.57 As Gino reassures Giovanna, destiny is on their side; it cannot turn its back on parents-to-be. But Giovanna becomes scared when the truck in front of them makes a sudden unexpected manoeuvre, and grabs the steering wheel from Gino. Their car skids into the Po River, and Giovanna dies in the crash. The police arrive on the scene and take Gino into custody. Ossessione comes to a close with Giovanna gazing at Gino for one last time, and a frontal medium shot of Gino in tears, looking at his dead lover as she is taken away from him (figures 8 and 9).\n\nWilliam Van Watson has focused precisely on the system of looks that Ossessione sets up, analysing how the camera – from the film’s beginning to its conclusion – establishes Gino as the object of everyone’s gaze.58 Bragana, Giovanna, Spagnolo, Anita: they all look at Gino’s body. Drawing from Laura Mulvey, Van Watson interprets Gino’s status as a body to be looked at as a manifestation of Visconti’s homosexuality. While the camera’s attraction to Gino is undeniable, it might be limiting to attribute the investment in his body to a displacement of the author’s sexual preference. An approach that reduces Ossessione to a voyeuristic homosexual spectacle and Gino to an objectivized fetish risks overlooking the collaborative dimension of the film as well as the insurrectional moment to which it belonged. Alicata and one of the screenwriters, Gianni Puccini, were already in jail when Ossessione was released; Visconti would be arrested shortly afterwards, during the Nazi occupation of Rome, and only narrowly avoided execution. By that point De Santis had gone underground, abandoning his position as Rossellini’s assistant director on the subsequently aborted Scalo merci/Goods Station (1943) in order to join the resistance movement. Gino is indeed a vexed figure, caught between different gazes, horizons of desire and systems of intimacy. But considering the film in the context of the looming antifascist insurrection allows us to appreciate how the visual attachment to the tramp’s wavering body materializes not merely Visconti’s closeted homosexual desires but also the Cinema cell’s political gambit. In this regard, the gaze that the group chose to celebrate the regime’s collapse is significant.\n\nIn July 1943, immediately after Benito Mussolini’s arrest, the Cinema cell took editorial control away from his son Vittorio and released an issue that explicated the antifascist valence of their previous interventions on realism. The unsigned article, ‘This public, these masses’, specified that even if the Duce had been removed from power, the fight against fascism was not over: a lot had yet to be done, and a lot had to be done by cinema, to educate the nation and show it the path forward.59 In the celebratory number issued after the 8 September armistice – when Italy surrendered unconditionally to the Allies – the group featured Spagnolo on the journal’s cover (figure 10). Spagnolo looks towards an off-frame Gino one last time, his eyes pleading with him to take charge of his own existence instead of remaining mired in destructive patterns of behaviour. Spagnolo is about to go to Sicily – the Sicily of the Cinema cell interventions on realism, which in September 1943 had already been liberated by the Allies – and then to Naples and Genoa, two crucial hubs of the partisan insurrection against Nazi-fascism. For Spagnolo these are all beautiful paesi (lands, countries). But Gino does not have the courage to explore this new Italian paesaggio (landscape), to echo the title of De Santis’s 1941 manifesto. From the Cinema cover, then, Spagnolo hails new comrades who might join him in his journey. His gaze directly addresses the public, who are put into Gino’s position and made to identify with him. Understanding this gaze purely as sublimated homosexual desire minimizes its force as a call to action and as a placeholder for a type of embodiment that exceeds the hegemonic social milieu. In fact Gino’s diegetic failure puts spectators in the spotlight, awakening them to their extradiegetic responsibilities and turning them into historical actors at a moment when the old nation has crumbled and a new one is being invented.60 Hijacking the cinematographic apparatus to denounce the toxicity of present Italian reality, the Cinema group urged a people caught between a stifling past and an unwritten future to make a decision. Either kill the father and take his place as the head of the home, or understand that the only chance of moving past fascist normality is to respond to Spagnolo’s soft eyes and to build a new Italy together – a lyrical country unburdened by the chronotopes of melodrama and the borders of nationalism.\n\nThe problem is that Spagnolo’s call did not have the chance to reach the public. Even after the liberation, Ossessione never enjoyed a proper theatrical release and its impact on Italian popular culture cannot compare to that of films by De Sica or Rossellini. Catherine O’Rawe holds that Ossessione’s marginalization in Italy’s film canon is connected to the film’s formal hybridity. Ossessione, she claims, could hardly fit into a cultural landscape dominated by neorealism’s quasi-documentary style. The postwar critical reception of the film somehow echoed the reactions it had sparked under fascism: Visconti’s debut was too French, too American, too melodramatic; neither realistic nor Italian enough.61 The treatment of Ossessione as a foreign genre fiction can also be seen in relation to the geopolitical context in which post-Mussolini Italy was caught, and approached as disavowal of the Cinema cell’s representation of national life. With its pointed indictment of fascism as a typically Italian phenomenon, how could Ossessione be taken seriously in a nation that, after almost three years of civil war, was keen to forget the past and promptly return to normal life? Given the heterosexual dogmatism of both the Communist and Christian Democratic Parties, how could anyone take the film’s queer world view seriously and follow its lead on authentic antifascism? On the basis of Karl Schoonover’s recent reassessment of neorealism’s moral conservatism, one could speculate that the failure of Ossessione and the success of, for example, Rossellini’s films were somehow overdetermined by the political juncture faced by Italy in the aftermath of World War II: the ideological vectors of a film like Roma città aperta/Rome Open City (1946) resonated better in a country pressured both domestically and internationally to archive fascism as a momentary parenthesis in the country’s history, rather than something with profound roots in the body politic.62 If the mythos of ‘good people’ that neorealism streamlined was to pass as the truth about the Italian people, Ossessione could not be accepted as a realistic exposé of national life.\n\nIn 1945 Elio Marcuzzo, the actor who played Spagnolo, was buried alive by a group of partisan fighters, as a result of either a tragic mix-up or a personal vendetta. By then, Benito Mussolini had been hanged in Piazza Loreto, Italy had been liberated, and top-ranking members of the dissolved Fascist Party were being reinstated into key social roles. The dreams of a partisan uprising had already faded away. The insurrection against the regime did not bring about radical democracy, and the resistance did not culminate in a social revolution. Ossessione’s subaltern, revolutionary, transnational, queer new realism was to give way to neorealism’s cult of family and virtue. Ossessione was not Italy, Vittorio Mussolini had apocryphally claimed. Nor was it going to be. Returning to the film and to the context from which it emerged, returning one more time to Gino’s contested body, thus remain important ways to bring to light the past existence of an unrealized future for both Italy and its cinema.\n\n© The Author(s) 2019.
