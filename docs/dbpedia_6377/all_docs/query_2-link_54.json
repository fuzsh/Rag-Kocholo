Have a nice reading!\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bf 109 provides history with an interesting paradox. An unwanted fighter during its early development – due to unwarranted political influence and the high risk associated with its innovative and advanced design – it was to become the standard by which all other fighters of the World War II era would be judged.\n\nServing the Luftwaffe in almost every capacity including interceptor, fighter-bomber, nigh-fighter, photo-reconnaissance, escort fighter, and ground attack, the basic Bf 109 airframe survived the duration of the European conflict as the mainstay of the German air force, being produced in a greater number than any other plane (over 30,000 were delivered) past or present. The Bf 109 was also produced in more variants than any other aircraft of its era, with over eleven variants of the G version alone.\n\nAlthough the Bf 109 had a number of inherent drawbacks that at times detracted from its adaptability to its multi-mission role, with a capable pilot at its controls it was normally more than a match for any of its counterparts. Its effectiveness is attested to by the fact that from its initial flight trials in 1935 until it was finally phased out of service with the Spanish Air Force in 1967, the basic Bf 109s career span over 30 years with various countries around the world.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1940, some five years after its first introduction, the now famous Bf 109 remained superior to any fighter aircraft of the time. In 1945, with the ending of hostilities in Europe, the Bf 109 was still considered to be more than formidable enemy in the hands of a competent pilot. The introduction of what was to become the standard dayfighter for the Luftwaffe, however, was anything but ordinary. It was, in fact, the result of a number of daring and unconventional business tactics and several fortunate twists of fate that eventually provided the Bf 109 with the opportunity it deserved to prove itself the capable and respected fighter it was to become.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the success of the Bf 109 lay in the factors that influenced its advanced structural design and unique aerodynamic features. Although the concepts were radical for their time, the majority of them were not new, having been tried and tested on several earlier aircraft from various manufacturers around the world. It was, however, in the Bf 109 that all the concepts and aero-technological advances were married into a single aircraft. The risk of this approach was evident, but the relationship of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke BMW's origins can be traced back to three separate German companies: Rapp Motorenwerke, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, and Automobilwerk Eisenach. The history of the name itself begins with Rapp Motorenwerke, an aircraft engine manufacturer. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty. To maintain in business, BMW produced farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. In 1922, former major shareholder Camillo Castiglioni purchased the rights to the name BMW, which led to the company descended from Rapp Motorenwerke being renamed Süddeutsche Bremse AG (known today as Knorr-Bremse). Castiglioni was also an investor in another aircraft company, called \"Bayerische Flugzeugwerke\", which he renamed BMW. (Bavarian Aircraft Works) to the German government, left the company with no other alternative in the competition for a new Luftwaffe fighter.\n\nThe poor standing of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) and the Luftwaffenfuehrungsstab (Operations Staff) had its origin in 1929 and involved a disagreement between Dr. Willy Messerschmitt Willy Messerschmitt, (born June 26, 1898, Frankfurt am Main—died Sept. 17, 1978, Munich), German aircraft engineer and designer.\n\nMesserschmitt was educated at the Munich Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in engineering in 1923. From 1926 he was employed as chief designer and engineer at the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in Augsburg. His interest in gliders and sailplanes was carried into his early designs, which included the Bf 109 single-seat monoplane. and Erhard Milch Erhard Milch (30 March 1892 – 25 January 1972) was a German field marshal and war criminal who oversaw the development of the Luftwaffe as part of the re-armament of Nazi Germany following World War I. Milch's father was Jewish but this fact was hidden by Hermann Göring. During World War II, he was in charge of aircraft production; his ineffective management resulted in the decline of the German air force and its loss of air superiority as the war progressed. He was convicted of war crimes during the Milch Trial held before the U.S. military court in 1947 and sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 1954., the Director of Lufthansa Procurement. Messerschmitt had established his own aircraft manufacturing company, Messerschmitt Flugzeughbau G.m.b.H. Messerschmitt AG was a German aircraft manufacturing corporation (AG) named after its chief designer Willy Messerschmitt and known primarily for its World War II fighter aircraft, in particular the Bf 109 and Me 262. The company survived in the post-war era, undergoing a number of mergers and changing its name from Messerschmitt to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm before being bought by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA, now part of Airbus) in 1989., in March, 1926 and, based on early success, had been provided a subsidy from the Bavarian State Government, German Defense Ministry and a banking firm. It became apparent in 1927 that the Bavarian Government could not support both aircraft firms, and pressure was brought to bear on Messerschmitt to merge his company with BFW. On 8 September 1927, an agreement was signed which assigned total design and development responsibility for new aircraft to the Messerschmitt team and production responsibility to the BFW firm.\n\nThe initial aircraft to be designed and produced under this new arrangement was a 10-seat passenger plane designated M-20.\n\nNumerous problems plagued the development schedule of the aircraft and after the first prototype crashed during flight trials in February, 1928, Lufthansa, represented by Erhard Milch, cancelled the order. A second prototype was quickly produced and after a successful fight test, the order was reinstated by Lufthansa. A year later, however, the order for 10 of the M-20s was again cancelled and Lufthansa requested its downpayment returned. The BFW, having utilized on portion of this funding to place long lead material and component orders, and still another portion to finance in-house development of more advanced aircraft, was unable to meet the repayment demands and filed bankruptcy on 1 June, 1931.\n\nThe heated exchanges between Messerschmitt and Milch during this period resulted in an irreversible hatred between the two men that was to last through future years and have a definite influence on the success of BFW and on the design of the Bf 109.\n\nUnder Messerschmitt’s direction, the BFW was reformed and reorganized; however, the bitterness that existed between Messerschmitt and Milch, who had risen to the position of Secretary of State of Aviation under Adolf Hitler, continued to restrict growth and progress of the firm. Milch was adamant in his objective of restricting the BFW’s role in support of the new government’s aircraft program to strictly a licensed, second-source producer of other German aircraft manufacturer’s designs.\n\nDue to the lack of German government support, either for commercial or military aircraft projects, Messerschmitt decided to chance the punishment of the Hitler regime and to solicit business outside of Germany in an effort to maintain his small design and manufacturing team. The company was successful in obtaining a pair of contracts from Rumania which placed orders for a commercial transport and a single-seat trainer under the designations M-36 and M-37.\n\nIt took Milch only a few days to publicly denounce Messerschmitt and the BFW for their support of a foreign government’s (and possible future enemy’s) aircraft industry. The Gestapo made a number of visits to Augsburg to discuss the matter with Messerschmitt and other officials of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke. However, the young Messerschmitt held his ground and reiterated the fact that the only means of monetary support for his fledgling firm must come from foreign countries due to the prevailing attitudes of Milch and other member of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) The Ministry of Aviation (German: Reichsluftfahrtministerium), abbreviated RLM, was a government department during the period of Nazi Germany (1933–45). It is also the original name of the Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus building on the Wilhelmstrasse in central Berlin, Germany, which today houses the German Finance Ministry (Bundesministerium der Finanzen).\n\nThe Ministry was in charge of development and production of all aircraft developed, designed and built in Germany during the existence of the Third Reich, overseeing all matters concerning both military and civilian designs — it handled military aviation matters as its top priority, particularly for the Luftwaffe. As was characteristic of government departments in the Nazi era, the Ministry was personality-driven and formal procedures were often ignored in favour of the whims of the Minister, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. As a result, early successes in aircraft development progressed only slowly and erratically during World War II..\n\nNo further actions were taken against Messerschmitt or the BFW, most likely due to the close relationship of Hermann Göring Hermann Wilhelm Göring (12 January 1893 – 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the Pour le Mérite (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of Jagdgeschwader 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen., Minister of Aviation, and Theo Croneiss Oberleutnant Theodor Croneiss (18 December 1894 – 7 November 1942) was a World War I fighter pilot credited with five aerial victories.\n\nHaving survived the war as an oberleutnant, Croneiss became a sporting aviator. He became director of a flying club that sponsored Willy Messerschmitt. Croneiss piloted one of Messerschmidt's early designs, the M-21, to win the designer a 60,000 Reichsmark prize. In 1928-1929, Croneiss won the East Prussia Flying Trophy with the M-23 model. He later evolved into a test pilot for the Messerschmitt Company., whom Goering had personally asked to join Messerchmitt in 1933 to assist in reorganizing and rebuilding the reformed BFW.\n\nA fortunate turn of events for the BFW finally occurred in late 1933 when the Luftwaffe decided that the 4th Challenge de Tourisme Internationale, taking place in 1934, would provide the new German government with an opportunity to display its advanced aviation technology. The Bayerische Flugzeugwerke was, along with other German aircraft producers, requested to design and develop a competition sports plane for the races. BFW had, in fact, developed an aircraft for the 1932 Challenge de Tourisme Internationale under the designation M-29. However, the first of the four to be built crashed on 8 August. The following day, a second plane lost power in flight and although the pilot was able to bail out, the flight mechanic was killed in the ensuing crash, and the M-29 was grounded and prohibited from participating in the races.\n\nDue to the limited time available and the advanced state of design progress made on the Rumanian-ordered M-37 trainer, Messerschmitt decided to base the new sports plane on the M-37 airframe. By October, 1933, the BFW was machining metal for the redesignated Bf 108. The aircraft was a two-seater with side-by-side controls, and incorporated a highly advanced monoplane construction with a flush-riveted stressed outer skin. Powered by a 250 hp Hirth MH-8U in-line V*8 or a 218 hp Argus AS-17, the Bf 108A attained airspeeds in excess of 320 km/h (200 mph) and was extremely maneuverable. The small wing of the Bf 108 was fitted with both leading and trailing edge slots for maximum lift and was constructed around a single-spar concept patented by Messerschmitt.\n\nThe initial Bf 108A was flown in February, 1934, at the BFW airfield near Augsburg , and the results of the trials exceeded even the most optimistic performance projections of the BFW staff. The next five aircraft rolled off the assembly lines at Augsburg between February and June and were accepted by the Luftwaffe for competition flying by a team of expert military pilots headed by Theo Osterkamp Theodor \"Theo\" Osterkamp (15 April 1892 – 2 January 1975) was a German fighter pilot during World War I and World War II. A flying ace, he achieved 32 victories in World War I. In World War II, he led Jagdgeschwader 51 through the Battle of Britain and claimed a further 6 victories, in the process becoming one of only a few men to score victories in both world wars.\n\nOn 19 September 1939, Oberst Osterkamp was appointed Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51—51st Fighter Wing).[Note 1][7] During the Battle of France, he claimed four victories. During the Kanalkampf period of the Battle of Britain in July 1940, he claimed a further two victories, (a Bristol Blenheim on 1 June and a Spitfire on 13 July 1940) bringing his total to six. He was replaced as commander of JG 51 by Werner Mölders on 23 July with the latter formally taking command on the 27th of July. Promoted to Generalmajor, Osterkamp was awarded his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 22 August 1940. Following his replacement in JG 51, Osterkamp was appointed Jagdfliegerführer 2, the commander of fighter aircraft in Luftflotte 2.\n\nOn 1 August 1942, he was transferred to Luftgaustab z.b.V. Afrika. On 5 April 1943, he was appointed Jagdfliegerführer Sizilien and served until replaced on 15 July by Adolf Galland. He then served in a number of staff positions until being appointed Inspekteur der Luftwaffen-Bodenorganisation (Inspector of Luftwaffe ground organisation) in 1944. After criticism from High Command, he was dismissed from the service on 21 December 1944.. Although minor problems with the aircraft appeared between May and June, no major setbacks were incurred and the flight testing proceeded without any substantial delays.\n\nThen, on 27 July 1937, the bad luck which had been a constant nemesis to Messerschmitt, appeared again. The first prototype, coded D-I.BUM, crashed and killed the pilot, a member of the Ministry of Aviation. In an effort to ensure that the Bf 108 would not be grounded as had the 1932 M-20, Messerschmitt and the design staff at the BFW worked feverishly to incorporate modifications in to the remaining five aircraft to preclude reoccurrence of the mishap. The plane was finally certified before the end of July and cleared to race.\n\nThe Bf 108 performed admirably, but finished behind a pair of Polish RWD-9s (RWD-6s had won the rally in 1932) and a German Fieseler Fi 97. Proving itself the fastest of the aircraft entered, however, the Bf 108 had laid the groundwork for the entry of the BFW into the Luftwaffe’s pending new fighter competition and had justified the firm’s belief in the new construction techniques and advanced technological concepts employed in its design.\n\nThe initial specifications for a new Luftwaffe fighter were formulated and issued in early 1934 to Focke-Wulf, Arado and Heinkel. However, due to the influence of Erhard Milch, no request was forwarded to the BFW. The new fighter was the result of studies conducted by the C-Amt (Technical Office) of the German Air Ministry and required a low-wing monoplane configuration with a minimum armament of a pair of 7.9-mm MG 17 machineguns and performance characteristics that emphasized structural integrity during a powered dive, spin recovery controls, and provisions for being fitted with a high performance liquid-cooled inverted V-12 cylinder powerplant. (Two companies, Junkers and Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz AG was a German manufacturer of motor vehicles and internal combustion engines, which was founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest – which was valid until 2000 – was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Daimler had died in 1900, and Maybach had left in 1907.\n\nBoth companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged - becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) - and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of \"Mercedes-Benz\" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.\n\nAlthough Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II, Daimler-Benz employed slave labour., were actively engaged in the development of this powerplant at the time of the specification release by C-Amt).\n\nA combination of events including the friendship of Goering and Croneiss, the respect of several Luftwaffe officers familiar with the Bf 108A and uninvolved in the Messerschmitt/Milch feud, and the workloads of the other aircraft firms, finally resulted in the issuance of a development contract to BFW in 1935 for a competitive fighter aircraft. Informed by Milch, that it was solely a development contract and that no production contract would be let to BFW, Messerschmitt was faced with a decision to accept the award and try to overcome Milch’s bias with a superior aircraft, or to decline the contract, which at the time promised no long term security, and instead accept an offer for full professorship at Danzig Technical University. Fortunately for Germany, Messerschmitt opted for the former and pushed forward with his innovative and unique fighter design, the Bf 109.\n\nHad Milch, even in his most far reaching fantasies, anticipated that the proposed Bf 109 would have even been an equal concepts submitted by the other firms, let alone far superior, he would surely never have approved the prototype development contract for the BFW.\n\nThe Bf 109 proposed by BFM had actually been on the drawing boards of Messerschmitt’s staff since the initial flight of the Bf 108 in February, 1934, and was designed around the basic Bf 108A airframe. Like the Bf 108, the Bf 109A incorporated the cantilever low-wing monoplane configuration and retracting landing gear, and the single place cockpit was fitted a fully hinged canopy.\n\nHe prototypes for the design were initiated in late 1934 and by August, 1935, the first f these was ready for ground trials at Augsburg. The aircraft was fitted with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 upright-vee liquid-cooled powerplant with a 695 hp rating at take-off. The Kestrel engine was used in early prototype Heinkel He 112. Arado AR 80 and the Bf 109 due to the lack of availability of the new Junkers Jumo 210 and Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz AG was a German manufacturer of motor vehicles and internal combustion engines, which was founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest – which was valid until 2000 – was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach.

That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.\n\nAlthough Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II, Daimler-Benz employed slave labour. DB 600 engines which were still undergoing development testing.\n\nThe trials at Augsburg , including extensive undercarriage testing on the struts and retraction, and extension mechanisms, were completed without problems. After undergoing minor modifications, the Bf 109A V1, (V designation for experimental) coded D-IABI, was flight-tested for the first time in September. Successful completion of these initial flight trials, which verified the handling characteristics and performances of the basic design, led to acceptance of the aircraft for flight testing at Rechlin (Luftwaffe Test Center). The Bf 109A V1 was flown to Rechlin and was immediately the object of suspicion by the assembled Luftwaffe test pilots. Used to the open cockpit, low wing loadings, and sturdy construction of the earlier biplanes, the test pilots could not accept the fully enclosed cockpit, innovative automatic wing slots, and the high ground angle of the new fighter which restricted the forward view during taxiing.\n\nThe exhibitions of the Bf 109As flight characteristics, including a 467 km/h (290 mph) airspeed which was 5% faster than the He 112 V1 (also at Rechlin for evaluation), did little no overcome the test pilots’ bias for the wide track lover wing loading He 112. In the meantime, unconcerned than the He 112 was considered to be the forerunner in the fighter competition by knowledgeable Luftwaffe personnel, the BFW continued construction of the second and third prototypes. With the availability of the Junkers Jumo 210A powerplant installation, a few minor structural modifications to the undercarriage, and in the addition of an air intake for cooling of the proposed MG 17 machine-guns which would be installed in the aircraft’s cowling. The fitting of the machine-guns occurred for the first time on the Bf 109A V3 and was the only change from the V2 aircraft. (The V3, however, did not roll off the Augsburg assembly line until May, 1936, due to delays in the delivery of the required Jumo 210A engine).\n\nWith the elimination of the Arado and Focke-Wulf prototypes from serious competition due to mechanical failures and low performance, the unwanted and unpopular design from the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke suddenly found itself in a position to become the next generation Luftwaffe fighter. Adding to the Bf 109s favor was the fact that German Intelligence had, in mid-1936, reported the production order of the new Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire, an aircraft much like the Messerschmitt in so far as it incorporated many similar technological advances.\n\nIn addition, continued superior performance demonstrated by the Bf 109 in comparison to the heavier and slower He 112 was beginning to the influence even the most determined detractors of the BFW fighter at the RLM. As the flight evaluation trials continued through the fall of 1936 at Travemuende , the Bf 109 became an odds-on favorite. Demonstration of the Bf 109s ability to roll and recover at will, to maintain structural integrity under steep power dives from high altitudes, to turn inside and to outclimb the He 112, far outweighed the rumors and poor press that the new aircraft had been exposed to. Although not unanimous in its decision, the RLM recommended the selection of the Bf 109, and an order for 10 pre-production aircraft was placed with BFW.\n\nSubstantiation of this decision was to occur only weeks later when the Luftwaffe staged an aviation display at Rechlin for Generalfeldmarschall Goering and other high ranking officials of the RLM. The aerial displayed finished with a mock air battle in which a force of bombers were to be intercepted by a flight of four He 51s. After this interception, Oberst Ernst Udet Ernst Udet (26 April 1896 – 17 November 1941) was a German pilot and air force general during both World War I and World War II.\n\nUdet joined the Imperial German Air Service at age 19, eventually becoming a notable flying ace of World War I, scoring 62 confirmed victories by the end of his life. The highest scoring German fighter pilot to survive that war, and the second-highest scoring after Manfred von Richthofen, his commander in the Flying Circus, Udet rose to become a squadron commander under Richthofen, and later under Hermann Göring.[1] Udet spent the 1920s and early 1930s as a stunt pilot, international barnstormer, light aircraft manufacturer, and playboy.\n\nIn 1933, Udet joined the Nazi Party and became involved in the early development of the Luftwaffe, where he was appointed director of research and development. Influential in the adoption of dive bombing techniques as well as the Stuka dive bomber, by 1939 Udet had risen to the post of Director-General of Equipment for the Luftwaffe. The stress of the position and his distaste for administrative duties led to Udet developing alcoholism.\n\nThe launch of Operation Barbarossa, combined with issues with the Luftwaffe's needs for equipment outstripping Germany's production capacity and increasingly poor relations with the Nazi Party, caused Udet to commit suicide on 17 November 1941 by shooting himself in the head. (famous fighter ace of World War I) was to take off in the Bf 109A V3 and intercept the four He 51s. Udet took off and destroyed the four He 51s in simulated combat, and then, on his own initiative, attacked the bombers and was credited with destroying the entire formation in his new single-place fighter.\n\nBf 109B series (pre-production)\n\nThe Bf 109B-0 designation was allocated to pre-production aircraft to be utilized in optimizing the basic Bf 109 airframe, powerplant and armament. They were therefore assigned the standardized series of experimental, or ‘V’ codes that identified developmental aircraft. The initial Bf 109B, coded V4, closely resembled its Bf 109A predecessors in that it was fitted with the Junker Jumo 210A. However, it incorporated an additional MG 17 machine-gun located between the cylinders of the engine and firing through the propeller hub. This added armament was installed in response to the Luftwaffe Operations Staff’s final evaluation review of the prototype tests which noted that the original requirement for only a pair of the 7.9-mm weapons provided insufficient firepower.\n\nThe Bf 109 V4, flown for the first time in November, 1936, was followed during the next two months by the V5 and V6. These aircraft were fitted with the improved performance Jumo 210B powerplant and included other minor refinements consisting of the replacement of the gun cooling intake with a trio of flush cooling slots, a change in the wing support structure to allow for removal of the wing panel stiffeners added to the second prototype aircraft during undercarriage load testing.\n\nNot only did these three aircraft successfully complete their pre-flight trials, but they were actually evaluated under combat conditions, when in December, 1936, and January, 1937, the three planes were shipped to Jadggruppe 88 in Spain to assist the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. Germany had, in mid-1936, committed itself to support of the Nationalists and assinged Jagdgruppe 88, equipped with He 51s, to Seville. However, during the initial engagements between the He 51s of Jadggruppe 88 and the Soviet-built Polikarpov I-15 fighters used by the Republican Forces, The German fighter had continuously been out performed. It was decided by the Luftwaffe Command to send the new experimental fighters into the conflict to evaluate their strong points and shortcoming.\n\nAs would be expected, the new aircraft suffered from the vast array of minor mechanical problems which normally plague the early development of new fighters. However, it did prove its superior performance in service operations and verified the decision of the Luftwaffenfuehrungsstab in selecting the Bf 109 over the He 112. The three fighters were subsequently returned to Augsburg to be reinstated into the planned development program.\n\nBf 109 V7 started its flight testing in March, 1937, and was fitted with a Jumo 210G powerplant with fuel injection and a two-stage supercharger that provided over 700 hp for take-off compared to the 610 hp rating of the earlier Jumo 210A. This aircraft was to serve as the prototype for the Bf 109B-2.\n\nThe V8, V9 and V10 aircraft were identified as prototypes for the Bf 109C. The V8 and V9 models were powered by the Jumo 210Ga powerplant, was re-engined with a high-performance DB 600Aa which delivered over 900 hp for take-off. The V8 incorporated a pair of wing-mounted MG 17 machine-guns just outside of the undercarriage strut which required a few simple modifications to the wing’s leading edge, and firing trials proved so successful that the new four machine-gun armament was adopted as standard for the later Bf 109C.\n\nThe V9 was similar to the V8 except that it was fitted with a pair of 20-mm MG FF cannon in the wings in place of the 7.9-mm machine guns. However, minor problems with the higher caliber weapon restricted its incorporation into the production of aircraft until the evolution of the E-version.\n\nThe V10 model, with its DB 600 powerplant, crashlanded during an attempt by Ernst Udet (was had become one of the Bf 109’s most ardent supporters) to set speed records at the Zurich-Duebendorf International Flying Meeting in July, 1937, and was replaced by the V11 for powerplant testing of the new Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz AG was a German manufacturer of motor vehicles and internal combustion engines, which was founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest – which was valid until 2000 – was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Daimler had died in 1900, and Maybach had left in 1907.\n\nBoth companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged - becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) - and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of \"Mercedes-Benz\" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.\n\nAlthough Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II, Daimler-Benz employed slave labour. engine. The Bf 109 V12 and V13 (the last of the original pre-production prototypes) were also originally fitted with the DB 600A. The V13 aircraft was later re-engined with the new and more powerful DB 601 and was the aircraft which set the world airspeed record for land-based aircraft in November, 1937, Covering a 3-km (1.86-mile) straight course twice in both directions, the Bf 109 V13 was clocked at an average airspeed of 610.5 km/h (379.38 mph).\n\nBf 109B series (production)\n\nWith the impressive success of the early prototype Bf 109Bs, production of the variant was ordered, and the initial Bf 109B-1 rolled off the assembly lines in February, 1937, The B-1 was essentially based on the V4, V5 and V6 models of the pre-production run and were powered by the supercharged Jumo 210Da engine driving a Schwarz twin-blade fixed-pitch wooden propeller which provided 680 hp at take-off. The armament was limited to a pair of cowling-mounted MG 17 machine-guns, with the through-propeller hub machine-gun being omitted due to cooling problems uncovered during the testing of the V4, V5 and V6 aircraft.\n\nOriginally scheduled to go into service with Jagdgeschwader 132 “Richthofen” the initial B-1s were delivered to 11 Gruppe for combat training; however, the assignment of these aircraft to Jadggrupper 88 in Spain was given top priority because of the proven advantages of the I-15 and I-16 over the Luftwaffe’s He 51s. The pilots and aircraft of JG 132 therefore, were immediately transferred to Jagdgruppe 88 after training.\n\nOnly 30 of the B-1 models were produced before the Luftwaffenfuehrungsstab switched the Augsburg assembly line over the Bf 109B-2, which differed from the B-1 only in the replacement of the wooden Schwarz airscrew with a variable-pitch VDM metal license-built (Hamilton-Standard) propeller. By July, 1937, the Bf 109B-2s were being delivered to 1 Staffel of Jagdgruppe 88.\n\nBecause Bayerische Flugzeugwerke was producing the new fighter at maximum capacity, and still not meeting the Luftwaffe’s need (although additional facilities were being constructed at Augsburg), a license agreement was signed with the Fieseler plant at Kassel for additional production. By December, aircraft from Fieseler The Gerhard Fieseler Werke (GFW) in Kassel was a German aircraft manufacturer of the 1930s and 1940s. The company is remembered mostly for its military aircraft built for the Luftwaffe during the Second World War.\n\nFieseler's other wartime production would largely consist of building other firms' aircraft under licence, including the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. In 1941 however, a Fieseler project for an unpiloted flying bomb (Fi 103) attracted the attention of the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium - \"Reich Aviation Ministry\"). This went into production as the Fieseler FZG-76 (flakzielgerät, antiaircraft targeting device), better known as the V-1.\n\nThe Fieseler factory was the target of many Allied air raids, but continued production throughout the war. Following the War, part of the factory continued in business for a few years, producing automotive components. Its most famous products, the Storch and the V1, continued to be produced by foreign companies. began to supplement the deliveries from Augsburg.\n\nBf 109B-2 Specifications\n\nBf 109C series\n\nThe Bf 109C-1 was based on the V8, V9 and V10 prototype models and incorporated the improved Junkers Jumo 210Ga engine which developed 700 hp at take-off. (A few of the final batches of the Bf 109 B-2 had been fitted with the Jumo 210Ga powerplant which was planned for initial incorporation into the Bf 109C.)\n\nThe C-1 also increased the basic Bf 109 armament through the additional of a pair of wing-mounted 7.9mm Rheinmetall MG 17 machine-guns and incorporated a revision of the powerplant exhaust exists and an increased radiator intake size which resulted in identifiable external differences from the B-1. In addition, the C-1 was fitted with an FuG 7 radio, providing direct communication between fighter-control ground forces and the plane, something that had not existed in the earlier models.\n\nThe Bf 109C-1s began leaving the assembly lines at Augsburg in March, 1938, and like its predecessors were immediately shipped to Spain to allow transition of the remaining He 51s and some of the initial Bf 109B-1s.\n\nThree additional variants of the Bf 109C were produced at Augsburg, these being the C-2, C-3 and C-4 models. The Bf 109C-2 was an experimental development model and was identical to the C-1 except that it incorporated the engine-mounted MG 17 machine-gun that had been eliminated from earlier variants due to cooling problems. The cooling of the gun mechanism had been increased through a number of material changes and increases in insulation and ducting. The Bf 109C-3 was used as a test bed for the incorporation of using wing-mounted 20-mm MG FF cannons.\n\nThe Bf 109C-4, in turn, replaced the engine mounted MG 17 with an MG FF cannon. The C-4s, however, were also utilized as developmental aircraft and were ever delivered to operational units.\n\nDuring the production of the C-version of the Bf 109, one other significant occurrence took place. That was the change of name of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to Messerschmitt A.G. This change was essentially the result of not only the great success of the aircraft, but also because of the national hero status Messerschmitt had achieved during the previous two years with his innovative and successful new aircraft concepts. Wishing to capitalize on this growing fame, the German Air Ministry had suggested to the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke management (which included Messerschmitt) that it could provide the company with a more international image through the name change.\n\nBf 109C-1 Specifications\n\nBf 109D series\n\nThe Bf 109D version was produced only as an interim fighter (approximately 200 being built) filing the gap between the Jumo 210 powered Bf 109C and the planned DB 601 powered Bf 109E. The DB engines, both the basic 600 and the improved 601 models, provided increased performance to the Messerschmitt fighter. The availability of both, however, was limited during 1937-38. These limitations on availability were the influencing factors, not only on the decision to produce the D-variant, but also on the quantity built. Having been designed from the outset to accept the new Daimler-Benz 600 series powerplants, the incorporation of this engine into the Bf 109 was delayed until 1937 because the DB 600 was utilized in the He 111 bomber and the production of bombers had received the highest priorities during the mid-thirties. In addition, the service acceptance of the improved DB 601 engine was delayed due to difficulties with the new automatically-monitored supercharger system, which provided the engine with added power and eliminated cut-outs even under high G loadings.\n\nRealizing that the DB 600 would not be available in sufficient quantities for a large production run of the Bf 109D, and that the DB 601 would not be ready for some months, the German Air Ministry opted to produce the interim D-version with the limited supply of Jumo 210D and Jumo 210G powerplants, and to forestall the installation of the newer DB 601 until the Bf 109E series evolved.\n\nThe Bf 109D program was initiated in mid-1937 with a pair of pre-production aircraft assigned the designation V14 and V15. However, these two planes were diverted to developmental efforts being started on the E-series aircraft, and the D-version was restricted to the utilization of the V11, V12 and V13 (Bf 109B-0 prototypes) for design and structural testing. The Bf 109D was to be the first model to feature the familiar lines that were to become the identification criteria for future variants. The aircraft would have been essentially identical to the earlier models from the cockpit aft, but he forward cowling would undergo a major change. The wide radiator intake would be replaced by a small, aerodynamically smooth, oil cooler intake and a pair of small glycol radiators would be added to the under-surface of each wing. A long supercharger air intake would also be added to the port side of the cowling just over the exhaust stubs. Structural strengthening was evident in the landing gear struts, undercarriage attach points and it the powerplant interface locations. However, all these modifications except for the structural changes, were delayed until the introduction of the E-version due to the reversion back to the Jumo powerplants.\n\nArmament for the Bf 109D consisted of the then standardized pair of cowl-mounted MG 17 machine-guns and a single 20-mm MG FF cannon between the cylinders of the inverted-Vee Jumo powerplant. The latter weapons was later removed for some of the aircrafts, as operational use still resulted in numerous occurrences of jamming, and flight characteristics were adversely influenced when the cannon was fired.\n\nIn an effort to increase armament and overcome the still unresolved engine-mounted weapon problems, the Bf 109D-2 was ordered. The D-2 was identical to the D-1 except that the center-mounted weapons was omitted and the aircraft was fitted with a pair of wing-mounted MG 17 machine-guns. In addition, a small number of Bf 109D-3s were produced that differed from the D-2 only in that they incorporated a pair of 20-mm MG FF cannon in the wings in place of the MG 17 machine guns.\n\nBf 109D-1 Specifications\n\nBf 109E series\n\nThe first large scale production version of the Bf 109 series was the Bf 109E. Powered by the DB 601A-1 engine, which had been fitted to the first pair of pre-production bf 109D-0 aircraft (V14 and V15), ten pre-production Bf 109E-0s were ordered for service evaluation, basically for acceptance testing of the new powerplant. The testing of the DB 601 was necessitated by the RLM's decision to cancel further production of the DB 600 in early 1938 based on promises from Daimler-Benz that production quantities of the DB 601 would be available for the E-series by mid-1938. Problems with the early DB 601s, however, had delayed its service acceptance, and thus, production of the Bf 109E.\n\nAssigning the first three pre-production codes (Bf 109E-01, -02, and -03) to the Bf 109 V13, V14 and V15, the remaining seven pre-production aircraft received designations of V16 through V22. These were utilized to test various armament and engine modifications.\n\nProduction deliveries of the Bf 109E-1 began early in 1939 with several of the initial aircraft being assigned to Spain with the Condor Legion, which began receiving the Bf 109E during February and March. Although these aircraft arrived too late to influence the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, a few scattered encounters between the new variant and the aircraft of the Republican Forced did take place, with the Bf 109E proving its vast superiority in almost every category.\n\nArmament of the early Bf 109E-1 included the standardized pair of cowl-mounted 7.9-mm MG 17 machine-guns and a pair of the same weapons installed in wings. However, based on the successful results of both testing with the V14, and the favoring of heavier armament by the RLM, later batches of the E-1 were produced with a pair of 20-mm MG FF cannon in place of the wing-mounted machine-guns. Due to the increased size of the cannons, a specially designed cover with a bulged shape was fitted to the lower wing to provide space for the larger weapon and its ammunition drum. In addition, a selector switch for control of both, or one, of the wing weapons was installed in the cockpit allowing the pilot a choice of firepower.\n\nBy the end of the hostilities in Spain in late March, 1939, only twenty of the planned 40 Bf 109E-1s had been delivered to Jagdgruppe 88. Although the Luftwaffe units in Germany were also re-equipping with the Bf 109E at this time, the twenty aircraft were transferred to the Spanish National Forces, along with the remaining Bf 109Bs and Bf 109Cs.\n\nThe next variant of the Bf 109E to reach production was the E-3, incorporating the improved DB 601Aa which delivered nearly 1,200 hp at take-off and had provision for the installation of an MG FF cannon between the powerplant's cylinders. Problems of jamming, overheating and vibration, however, still plagued this modification, and most of the installations were either removed in the field, or seldom used. The Bf 109E-3 also incorporated other modifications, including a revised canopy design with heavier frame, and the addition of armor plate behind the pilot's head and under the seat.\n\nThe Bf 109E-3 supplanted the Bf 109E-1 on the assembly lines in late 1939 and by the end of the year they had started arriving for operational service with frontline Luftwaffe units.\n\nBecause of the apparent failure of the nose-mounted MG FF cannon, and its subsequent removal after installation, it was decided to produce the Bf 109E-3 without the center-firing weapon. The result was the designation of Bf 109E-4, with production deliveries beginning during the summer of 1940.\n\nIt was also during this time that thoughts of employing the Bf 109 as a Jagdbomber (fighter-bomber) were being considered, based on the needs developed during fighting against the French. The concept was to attach a single bomb under the center fuselage and provide the pilot with an electrical release switch. To test the theory, an evaluation unit, Erprobungsgruppe 210 Schnellkampfgeschwader 210 (SKG 210) was a Luftwaffe fast-bomber wing during the Second World War. The unit was created in April 1941 and absorbed by the Zerstörergeschwader 1 on 4 January 1942.\n\nSKG 210 had its origins in Erprobungsgruppe 210 (Test Wing 210), formed at Köln-Ostheim airfield under the command of Hptm. Walter Rubensdörffer in July 1940 as the official service test unit for the then-new Messerschmitt Me 210, the intended successor to the earlier Messerschmitt Bf 110. However, such were the delays in that aircraft’s development that the unit was utilised to develop tactical and strategic practices required to operate the in-service Bf 110s in newer, fighter-bomber and ground-attack roles they were being adapted to. By the time the unit was re-designated I. Gruppe, Schnellkampfgeschwader 210 in April 1941 the unit was based at Abbeville, bombing Allied shipping and land-based targets. The unit then moved east to prepare for the attack on Soviet Russia as part of 2nd Air Corps and originally based at Radzyn.\n\nSome 50 serviceable Bf 110s took part in Operation Barbarossa from two units; Zerstörergeschwader 26 and Schnellkampfgeschwader 210. The Bf 110 provided support to the German Army, carrying out strike missions in the face of heavy AA and ground defences. In the opening air strikes, on 22 June, SKG 210 claimed 344 Soviet aircraft destroyed, more than any other unit, for the loss of 7 Bf 110s destroyed and damaged. SKG 210 flew over the Central part of the front supporting the German army's encirclement and overrunning of Russian land forces in the Białystok and Minsk areas in the early phase of the campaign, and flew in support of the advancing Army Group Centre advance to Moscow in 1941. Between 22 June 1941 and 26 July 1941 the unit claimed to have destroyed 823 Soviet aircraft on the ground and 92 in the air, 2,136 vehicles and 165 tanks destroyed for 57 Bf 110s lost to enemy action. With the coming of winter SKG 210 continued to operate in support of the army, covering their retreat., was formed and a number of Bf 109E-1s and Bf 110Cs were assigned as test aircraft.\n\nWith only very minimal training in dive-bombing techniques, the unit began their operational testing against British shipping in the English Channel. The results of the limited endeavor proved so successful that all Luftwaffe Jagdgeschwader were ordered to form one Staffel for Jabo operations. Normally consisting of nine Staffeln, this usually meant the addition of a tenth unit. To equip these new units, Bf 109E-1s, which were being replaced by the later model Bf 109E-3s and E-4s, were retrofitted with an ETC 50 rack for the carrying of a 50 kg (110-lb.) SC 50 bomb and assigned the designation Bf 109E-1/B. In addition, several Bf 109-E4s still on the assembly lines were converted to Bf 109E-4/Bs through the incorporation of a central ETC 250 rack which was capable of handling a single 250 kg (550-lb.) bomb or four SC 50 bombs.\n\nContinuing to strive for ever increasing performance, Daimler-Benz developed the DB 601N powerplant which not only delivered 1,200 hp at take-off, but also offered an emergency output of 1,250 hp for a duration of 1 minute at altitudes in the 4500 m (15,000 ft) range. The engine made use of flattened piston heads instead of the normal concave shape and increased the compression ratio by 15%. Due to this higher compression ratio the powerplant also required the use of higher octane fuel, necessitating a change from 87 to 96 octane. This powerplant was installed in to the Bf 109E-4 series in mid-1940 and the aircraft were given the designation of Bf 109E-4/N.\n\nThe Bf 109E-5 was identical to the standard Bf 109E-4 except that it included the installation of a Rb 21/18 camera in the aft fuselage and deleted the wing-mounted MG FF cannon. Produced side-by-side with the E-4, the E-5 was assigned the task of fighter-reconnaissance. With the elimination of the wing armament and ammunition the aircraft's overall weight was reduced to give it increased airspeed for escape from Allied fighter-interceptors. A further refinement of the basic fighter-reconnaissance concept was reflected of the basic fighter-reconnaissance concept was reflected in the Bf 109E-6, which was identical to the E-5 model, except that it incorporated the higher performance DB 601N which had first been installed on the Bf 109E-4/N.\n\nThe next Bf 109E variant to appear was the E-7 which was identical to the Bf 109E-4/N except that it included a factory-installed ventrally-mounted ETC 250 rack capable of interfacing with an expendable auxiliary fuel tank (for extended range operation), or with an SC 250 bomb for use as a long-range fighter-bomber. This variant was further modified during 1941 to include the Bf 109E-7/U-2, an early Umruest-Bausatz (factory conversion kit) which provided added armor plate protection for the underwing radiators, lower powerplant area and fuel tanks, and the Bf 109E-7/Z which incorporated a GM 1 injectant boost system to the engine. The injectant system tank, located behind the cockpit, contained nitrous oxide in liquid form which was fed to the powerplant by compressed air and injected into the supercharger where it provided added oxygen. This was, of course, advantageous at higher altitudes where the oxygen level is reduced, and the engine, dependent on oxygen for combustion, starts losing power. The injectant system, in effect, acted as an artificial altitude compensator.\n\nThe final two basic variants of the E-series were the Bf 109E-8 and the Bf 109E-9, which made their initial appearance in late 1940. The E-8 was almost identical to the basic E-1 variant, in that it was armed with a pair of fuselage-mounted weapons. Designated as an extended-range fighter, the E-8 was fitted with the underfuselage rack to carry an auxiliary drop tank. The E-9 model was a combination of several of the earlier innovations and modifications made on the E-series and was assigned the role of long-range photo-reconnaissance. The aircraft, powered by the DB 601N engine, was fitted with the auxiliary fuel tank rack, and incorporated an Rb 50/30 camera aft on the cockpit. Armament consisted of the MG 17 fuselage machine-guns, and a pair of wing-mounted MG FF cannon.\n\nMany other supplemental modifications were made to the basic Bf 109 E-series during its production career - late 1939 through early 1942. These included tropicalized versions of the Bf 109E-4, -5 and -7. The tropicalized modifications, resulting from the dusty environment of the North African area, included the installation of a filter over and in front of the supercharger air intake on the port side of the engine cowling and the packaging of a desert survival kit (including a lightweight cabine, food and water supply, signal equipment, etc.) inside the aircraft. The tropicalized versions of the Bf 109 were given the designation Trop. This term appeared after the basic model designation, as in Bf 109E-5/Trop.\n\nSeveral one-of-a-kind experimental projects were also conducted with the Bf 109E series including the use of skis and the incorporation of overwing or underwing fuel tanks. The idea behind the use of skis was to provide for operations from snow covered landing areas and, even possibly, deep sand. A Bf 109E-8 was fitted with a pair of faired skis in place of wheels (in actuality, the skies appeared to be more like hollow pontoons) and was flight tested both with the skis alone and using a jettisonable wheeled dolly for assist in take-offs. By the time the tests had been completed, experience by the Luftwaffe in actual winter environments had resulted in minimal difficulties, and as the skied version of the Bf 109E suffered in performance due to the increased drag of the skies and fairings, the project was dropped.\n\nThe use of jettisonable over the under wing fuel tanks to improve the range of the fighter was tested on a modified Bf 109E-4 in 1942. It was shown that the installation of these contoured tanks did not appreciably reduce overall airspeed, although they did, to a minor degree, decrease the aircraft's turning rate and overall handling characteristics. Because the need for this type of range was not critical (due in part to the installation of ventraly mounted drop tanks), the basic concept was cancelled. However, the possibility of utilizing the over-wing containers to carry personel and equipment on behind-the-lines espionage missions added new life to the program. In the summer of 1943, a Bf 109E-4 had been modified with re-contoured over-wing containers capable of carrying a man, his parachute and necessary survival equipment, and was test-flown at Stuttgart-Ruit . Tests showed only a minimal loss in airspeed. By this time, however, interest in the project had subsided and no evidence exists that this concept was never put to actual practice.\n\nBf 109E-3 Specifications\n\nBf 109E Illustrations\n\nBf 109F series\n\nIn early 1940, the Augsburg plant began a design improvement program with the intent of incorporating not only structural and aerodynamic modifications to the basic Bf 109 airframe, but also the installation of the higher performing powerplants that were then under development at Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz AG was a German manufacturer of motor vehicles and internal combustion engines, which was founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest – which was valid until 2000 – was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Daimler had died in 1900, and Maybach had left in 1907.\n\nBoth companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged - becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) - and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of \"Mercedes-Benz\" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.\n\nAlthough Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II, Daimler-Benz employed slave labour.. The result of this program was the Bf 109F.\n\nThe airframe changes were numerous and resulted in an external configuration that was to remain essentially unchanged through the remainder of the Bf 109 variants. The wing, which had remained the same since the inİtial prototypes of the basic Bf 109, maintained the primary contours and spar structure, but incorporated a pair of significant modifications to reduce drag and improve lifting characteristics. First, the underwing radiators, which were a large contributor to the aircraft's drag, were decreased in height and recessed deeper into the wing through the use of a unique system of flaps and ducts which reduced the turbulence normally associated with the radiator protrusion into the airstream. The installation of this system also resulted in a change in the length and span of both the leading and trailing edge control flaps and the elimination of interconnecting linkage between the flaps and ailerons fitted previously.\n\nA deeper, more streamlined cowling was also designed which tapered directly from the forward windscreen to the propeller hub and the air intake for the supercharger was moved farther into the airstream to increase the ram-effect of the scooped in air. The propeller hub, or spinner, was enlarged and lengthened to fit the new symmetrical cowling and contoured to reduce turbulent drag factors. In addition, the overall airscrew diameter was reduced by 10 cm (4 inch) through the use of wider blades.\n\nMajor modifications also were incorporated into the tail assembly section where the rudder area was slightly reduced and the tail-plane bracing struts, which had become an identifying feature of earlier Bf 109s, were removed. With the removal of the struts, the new cantilevered tail-plane was moved slightly forward and below the original positioning and the chord thickness increased for structural rigidity.\n\nPlanned for installation of the DB 601E engine which provided 1,350 hp for take-off, the four Bf 109F prototypes and ten pre-production aircraft were initiated in May, 1940. However, service testing and acceptance of the DB 601E had not yet been completed and, as a consequence, powerplant substitutions had to be made.\n\nThe first prototype, Bf 109 V21 utilized the DB 601Aa which had powered the later E-series while the last three prototypes all had early development DB 601E's installed. The Bf 109 V22 was to be utilized primarily for testing of the powerplant while the V23 and V24 aircraft were scheduled to be used for minor modifications to the new design in the area of structural and flight handling characteristics. The most significant change from the initial Bf 109F configuration was incorporated into V23, when elliptically shaped detachable wingtips were added to increase the wing surface area (reducing wing loading) and to restore overall wingspan dimensions that had been reduced with the incorporation of the improved underwing radiator system. Armament for the Bf 109F was standardized with the retention of the cowling-mounted 7.9-mm MG 17 machine-guns and the addition of a 20-mm MG 151 cannon firing through the hollow propeller shaft. The reduction in armament from the Bf 109E, which had either a pair of MG 17 machine-guns or MG FF cannon mounted in the wings, was the result of several operational pilots' reports which maintained that the concentrated firepower of the center located weapons was more effective than the converging fire of the wing mounted weapons and that, in addition, the elimination of the wing armament added to the aircraft's handling characteristics.\n\nDue to the continued delay in delivery of the planned DB 601E, the ten pre-production of Bf 109F-0s, which began rolling off the assembly lines in October 1940, were powered by the DB 601N engine with its flattened piston heads. The F-0s also were fitted with the older MG FF cannon in the nose as deliveries of the proposed electronically armed MG 151 and MG 151/20 (15-mm and 20-mm) were delayed.\n\nDeliveries of the initial Bf 109F-1 variant, very similar to its predecessor, the Bf 109F-0, began in November. The only real discernible difference in appearance was in the installation of the new extended supercharger air intake. This replaced the rectangular flush-mounted air in-take from the E-series that had been used on the early pre-production aircraft until tests of the optimum contour and inlet size were completed on the improved design.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the initial deliveries of the Bf 109F-1s to Luftwaffe service evaluation units a number of them were lost, with the only clue as to the cause being a few pilot's messages reporting violent vibrations just prior to complete loss of control and crash. The Bf 109Fs were grounded and the cause of the vibration problem was investigated, with concentration in the powerplant attach interfaces and structural supports. Finding no irregularities, the investigation centered on the tail assembly, and it was discovered that the removal of the bracing sluts had resulted in a high frequency vibration being set up in the fuselage at certain engine rpm levels. The aircraft were retrofitted with reinforcing plates in the tail-plane to fuselage attachment area and production was resumed.\n\nIn February and March, 1941, deliveries of the Bf 109F-1 gave way to the production of the Bf 109F-2 which varied from the F-1 only in that it replaced the nose-mounted MG FF cannon with the long awaited MG 151. The F-2 variant also was modified through the incorporation of a fuselage-mounted ETC 250 bomb rack or the addition of the GM 1 Nitrous Oxide Power Boost SystemGM-1 (Göring Mischung 1) was a system for injecting nitrous oxide (laughing gas) into aircraft engines that was used by the Luftwaffe in World War II. This increased the amount of oxygen in the fuel mixture, and thereby improved high-altitude performance. GM-1 was used on a number of modifications of existing fighter designs in order to counter the increasing performance of Allied fighters at higher altitudes.\n\nA different system for low-altitude boost known as MW 50 was also used, although GM-1 and MW 50 were rarely used on the same engine. MW-50 was a methanol-water injection system, which injected a mixture of methanol and water into the cylinders to cool the mix. Cooling causes the air to become denser, therefore allowing more air into each cylinder for a given volume. This is the same principle that intercoolers use.\n\nGM-1 was developed in 1940 by Otto Lutz to improve high-altitude performance. It could be used by fighters, destroyers, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, though its first use was in the Bf 109E/Z fighter. Originally, it was liquified under high pressure and stored in several high-pressure vessels until it was found that low-temperature liquefied nitrous oxide gave better performance due to improved charge cooling. It could also be stored and handled more conveniently and was less vulnerable to enemy fire.\n\nGM-1 was typically sprayed in liquid form directly into the supercharger intake from two jets of different bore while at the same time, the fuel flow was increased to take advantage of the additional oxygen from the nitrous oxide. The jets could be operated individually or in combination, yielding three steps of power increase, for example 120/240/360 HP at different GM-1 flow rates (60, 100 and 150 grams/sec). The development of a continuously variable injection system was considered, but apparently it never saw operational use.\n\nInitially intended as standard equipment for the Luftwaffe, in operational service it was found that GM-1 had some drawbacks. The additional weight of the equipment reduced performance on all missions, while the system was only used in the cases where the aircraft went to very high altitudes. GM-1 also became less attractive than originally imagined when in 1943, the previous trend towards ever increasing combat altitudes ended.\n\nWhile GM-1 saw little use in the second half of the war, the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H, which had been developed as a dedicated high-altitude interceptor, also received a GM-1 system to provide it with superior performance at high altitude. The Ta 152H was one of the few designs to support both GM-1 and MW 50. on a number of aircraft. As the Luftwaffe had not standardized either the Umruest-Bausatze (factory installed modifications which intended to increase performance or to utilize non-strategic materials) or the Ruestsaetze (bolt-on modifications that were added to the Bf 109 airframe for specific mission capabilities such as extended range and increased armament, and which could be incorporated either at the assembly line or in the field), the above noted modifications to the F-2 variant resulted in the designations of Bf 109F-2/Z (addition of GM 1 boost system) and the Bf 109F-2/B (addition of the ETC 250 ventral bomb rack) fighter-bomber. One further designation was allocated to the F-2 series, the Bf 109F-2/Trop, which was the tropicalized version. Like the previous Bf 109E-4/Trop, this sub-type was fitted with a dust filter over the supercharger air intake for use in the North African theater of operations.\n\nThe Bf 109F-3 and Bf 109F-4, which were produced simultaneously, replaced the F-2 variant on the assembly lines in early 1942 and differed from the F-2 in that they incorporated the long awaited DB 601E as the basic powerplant. The powerplant change was the only difference between the F-2 and F-3; however, the F-4 incorporated a number of additional modifications that were not externally discernible. These included an increase in the calibre of the MG 151 from 15-mm to 20-mm, the use of new self sealing fuel tanks, and an increase in the armor protection for the pilot. This protection included a thick steel plate behind the pilot's neck and upper back, and a similar plate mounted over his head under the bullet-resistant canopy glass. Both the F-3 and F-4 utilized the FuG 7a radio transmitter/receiver and Revi C/12D reflector gunsight that were standard on the earlier F-series.\n\nA number of Bf 109F-4s were also modified like the F-2 variant with the incorporation of the GM 1 nitrous oxide boost system (Bf 109F-4/Z). In addition, two further sub-type conversions were produced under the Bf 109F-4 designation. The first of these was the Bf 109F-4/R6 which was fitted with an extra pair of 20-mm MG 151 cannon in underwing gondolas. The increase in firepower was made at the request of General Adolf Galland and other top Luftwaffe fighter aces. The additional armament of the F-4/R6 was well received. The increased weight and added drag had a detrimental effect on the aircraft's handling qualities, however, reducing its capability as a \"dogfighter\", and the aircraft were used strictly as bomber-interceptors.\n\nThe second conversion was similar to that of the earlier fighter-bomber modifications to the Bf 109E-4/B and included attachment of the ventrally-mounted ETC 250 bomb rack capable of carrying a 250 kg (550 lb) bomb, a 300 lt (66 Imp gal) jettisonable fuel tank, or with an ER 4 adapter, four 50 kg (110 lb) SC 50 bombs.\n\nThe final two variants of the Bf 109F series were reconnaissance derivatives of the Bf 109F-4. The Bf 109F-5 eliminated the nose mounted cannon (for reduced weight and, thus, higher speed) and had a Rb 50/30 camera mounted in the aft fuselage. The Bf 109F-6 eliminated all armament and was fitted with a special camera bay in the underside of the fuselage just aft of the cockpit which was capable of utilizing Rb 20/30, Rb 50/30 or Rb 75/30 cameras. Both the F-5 and F-6 were fitted with a fuselage rack (R3 modification) for the 300 lt (66 Imp gal) auxiliary fuel tank.\n\nBf 109F-4 Specifications\n\nBf 109F Illustrations\n\nBf 109G series\n\nDuring late 1941 and early 1942, the RLM became increasingly concerned with higher aircraft speeds and was willing to accept higher wing and power loading risks. The necessity for a pressurized canopy was also among the requirements for higher altitude capability. The Bf 109G was to be their answer.\n\nThe G-version was planned to utilize the improved performance DB 605A powerplant with a take-off output of 1,450 hp and 1,250 hp at 20,000 feet. The only difference in the DB 605A and the then-popular DB 601E was that the new powerplant had a redesigned block which allowed oversized cylinders while maintaining the same centers. The increased volume raised the compression ratio while the basic dimensions of the overall engine remained the same. The installation of the DB 605A into the Bf 109G airframe, however, resulted in numerous structural changes as the new powerplant was not only more powerful (in torque), but was also heavier. As a consequence the weight spiral of the overall Bf 109 design continued upward, reducing handling and maneuvering characteristics.\n\nTo provide the necessary cockpit pressurization, Messerschmitt simply sealed the bulkheads, floorplate and sidewalls, incorporated a plate behind the pilot which seated with the fuselage wall on closure, and added seals to the hinged and open rails at the canopy to fuselage interfaces.\n\nConstruction of twelve pre-production Bf 109G-0s was started during the late summer of 1941, but the unavailability of the proposed DB 605A powerplant forced Messerschmitt to again substitute, this time with the DB 601E. The pre-production block was completed by October, 1941, and immediately, Messerschmitt set about initiation of the first production aircraft under the designation Bf 109G-1. The G-1, deliveries of which began in March, 1942, was fitted with a pressurized cockpit, incorporated the radio equipment of the Bf 109F-4 (FuG 7a) and was armed with an engine-mounted 20-mm Mauser MG 151 cannon with 200 rounds of ammunition and a pair of cowling mounted 7.9-mm MG 17 machine-guns with 500 rounds per gun. The G-1 was powered by the DB 605A-1 OR DB 605B-1 and included provisions for mounting the GM 1 nitrous oxide power boost system, with the main tank and liquid oxygen bottles being located behind the cockpit.\n\nOne additional modification to the G-1 that was not present on the G-0 models included the fitting of a pair of small air scoops just aft of the propeller hub on both sides on the fuselage. These air scoops were to provide direct airstream cooling of the powerful DB 605A engine, which during prolonged ground operation (such as extended taxiing) had a tendency to overheat causing the nose-mounted oil tank to seep over the hot engine. Fires could occur immediately, in which case shut-down solved the problem. In the air, where shut-down was not possible, the only solution was bailing out. In addition to the air scoops, the G-1 included an oil tank that was redesigned to allow for cooler operation and better sealing.\n\nSub-types of the G-1 variant during production included several Ruestsaetze and Umruest-Bausatze conversion kits.\n\nG-1/U-1: Evaluation aircraft incorporating a reversible-pitch Messerschmitt P-6 propeller. The propeller was to act like a thrust reverser on short field landings by redirecting airflow. Only a few of this model was delivered.\n\nG-1/R3: Long range fighter with the addition of an under-fuselage rack for the fitting of a 300 lt (66 Imp gal) auxiliary fuel drop tank.\n\nG-1/R6: Fighter/interceptor with a pair of 20-mm MG 151 cannon in underwing gondolas assigned to the bomber attack role.\n\nG-1/Trop: A specialized tropicalized version of the G-1 variant for use in North Africa. Because of continual overheating problems with the engine-mounted cannon in the desert heat, this model also replaced the cowl-mounted 7.9-mm MG 17 machine-guns with a pair of 13-mm MG 131 machine-guns to provide greater firepower if malfunctioning of the nose cannon occurred. The aircraft also was fitted with the appropriate dust filters for the supercharger intake and radiator areas.\n\nIt should be noted here that the possibility of more than one conversion kit being added to an aircraft existed, and often became the rule as the war progressed. In most instances, however, the specified aircraft only carried a single designation. For example, a Bf 109G-1/R6 could have not only been fitted with the underwing MG 151 cannon, but could also have had an underfuselage bomb rack (fighter bomber) or auxiliary fuel drop tank shackle (extended range fighter/interceptor) added.\n\nProduced in parallel with the Bf 109G-1, and in greater quantities, the Bf 109G-2 was identical except that it did not contain a pressurized cockpit or GM 1 power boost system. Sub-types of the basic Bf 109G-2 were also identical to those of the Bf 109G-1.\n\nOne unique experimental evaluation conducted on the Bf 109G-2 was a design for the development of an extended range fighter-bomber. A Bf 109G-0 (pre-production aircraft) was refitted with a DB 605A and redesignated Bf 109G-2/R-1 for this test. The basic problem was in the size of the SC 500 bomb that was planned to be carried, in that it did not provide adequate clearance for takeoff when attached. To solve the problem, Fieseler designed an auxiliary single-wheel undercarriage component that could be attached to the underside of the fuselage just aft of the bomb, raising the aircraft off the ground. The undercarriage could be released after take-off through a series of explosive bolts and returned to the ground by parachute. To increase range, the plane was also fitted two racks of shackles for attachment of a pair of 300 lt (66 Imp gal) drop tanks. After successful initial flight testing, however, the project was discontinued.\n\nIn April, 1942, the Bf 109G-4 was introduced into the assembly lines. The only major changes between it and the previous models were that it was not pressurized and had replaced the FuG 7a radio equipment with the newer and longer range FuG 16ZY equipment.\n\nAlthough designated as a photo-reconnaissance fighter to be fitted with a camera installation in the aft fuselage, the Bf 109G-4 was delivered in several variants, and functioned in a number of additional roles for the Luftwaffe. In addition to the modified variants produced under the G-1 and G-2 designation, the G-4 also was ordered and/or delivered in the R1, R2, R4 and R7 models.\n\nG-4/R1: Limited production fighter-bomber fitted with ventral bomb rack for carrying a SC 250 bomb.\n\nG-4/R2: Authorized fighter-bomber version incorporating the ETC/VIIId bomb rack capable of carrying four SC 50 bombs; however, this model was never delivered.\n\nG-4/R4: Reconnaissance fighter incorporating an Rb 50/30 camera and a pair of wing mounted 300 lt (66 Imp gal) drop tanks. This model, like the R2, never reached production.\n\nG-4/R7: Standard fighter fitted with directional finding equipment installed inside the aft fuselage behind the cockpit, including a D/F loop antenna, to facilitate the locating of the aircraft in poor weather, poor visibility or after a crash landing.\n\nWith the introduction of the G-4 into service in August, 1943, the next version of the G-series to reach production status was the Bf 109G-3. This aircraft was nearly identical to the Bf 109G-4 in basic equipment, except that it incorporated the pressurized cockpit and GM 1 power boost system of the G-1 version and was designated for high altitude operation. Although relatively few Bf 109G-3s were delivered to Luftwaffe units, it was produced in a number of models including R1, R2, R3, R6 and U2. The Bf 109G-3/U2 represented the first model of the Bf 109 series to use a non-strategic material in a major component. In this case, the tailplane was made of wood and a larger trim tab was included that was controllable from the cockpit. This aircraft was utilized for test and evaluation, with the wooden tailplane later being installed on several future G-series variants, except for the G-14 which utilized an entirely redesigned tailplane shape.\n\nIn addition, the Bf 109G-3 was the first G-series aircraft to exhibit wing surface bulges resulting from the use of larger tires necessitated by the increased weight of the G-series aircraft. The larger mainwheels, in addition to offering higher safety factors, required an increased area in the innerwing when retracted, and as the initial volume had been allocated to the smaller standard wheels of earlier variants, Messerschmitt either had to redesign the wing chord (which would mean complicated and extended testing), or add a slight drag-increasing bulge to the wing surface. The Bf 109G-5 entered production during the late June and early July of 1943, but did not appear with Luftwaffe units until January, 1944. The G-5 was powered by the DB 605A-1 engine, but in an effort to provide more efficient high altitude performance, was also delivered with an optional DB 605AS powerplant which was fitted with a larger supercharger. (Aircraft receiving the DB 605AS were designated with the alters AS after the variant, or Ruestsaetze (R), identification.) Armament of the Bf 109G-5 consisted of the engine mounted 20-mm MG 151 cannon and a pair of cowl-mounted 13-mm MG 131 machine-guns, which had been standardized for all future G-series variants. The increase in the size of the cowling weaponry resulted in still another set of external bulges, this time over the MG 131 breech blocks and ammunition feed chutes which were larger than those of the MG 17s.\n\nThe Bf 109G-5 was also fitted with a shorter radio mast and a directional finding loop antenna on later models, which incorporated the R7 directional transmitter inside the aft fuselage. One additional modification that was installed in the Bf 109G-5 was the improved vision “Galland” canopy which restructured the canopy braces and added bullet-resistant glass and thicker armor plate in key areas. This canopy was installed on a few late model G-5s, but did not become standard until the introduction of the G-14 variant.\n\nSub-types designations of the Bf 109G-5 to see service included the U2, R3, R6, R7 and the Trop., while authorization and plans for production of R1 and R2 models were received, but never started.\n\nOne unique modification into G-5 was the addition of a pair of underwing Wfr. Gr. 210-mm mortar tubes for operations against Allied bomber streams. Designated as the Bf 109G-5/BR 21, the mortar tube concept was actually developed and flown initially on the Bf 109G-6 which preceded the G-5 variant in delivery to service units.\n\nAs noted above, the Bf 109G-6, although put into production at the same time as the Bf 109G-5, actually entered service first. It was identical to the G-5 variant except that it did not have provisions for cockpit pressurization. Produced in essentially the same models as previous G-series variants, the G-6 modifications also included the U2, U3, U4 and N designations. The Bf 109G-6/U3 identified the aircraft as being fitted with the MW 50 water-methanol supercharger boost system. Utilizing the tanks located behind the cockpit (used for the GM 1 system), the MW injectant, composed of 50% water and 50% methanol, was fed into the supercharger below the rated altitude of the powerplant to increase power through higher boost pressures. This system could increase take-off performance by over 300 hp, and provide similar power boosts up to altitudes of 6000 m (20,000 ft).\n\nThe Bf 109G-6/U4 was the result of continuing efforts by the RLM and Messerschmitt to increase the firepower of the Bf 109. The U4 modification incorporated an engine-mounted 30-mm MK 108 short barrel cannon in place of the 20-mm MG 151. Manufactured by Rheinmetall, the MK 108 had a rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute, was electrically actuated and automatically operated through a compressed air system separate from the weapon. Although a large number of G-6s were scheduled to receive the U4 modification, the limited supply of MK 108s restricted its application and forced the retention of the MG 151 in most models.\n\nThe Bf 109G-6/N was a modification derived specifically for the night-fighting role. (As opposed to use of the “N” designation in the E-series to identify use of the DB 601N.) The aircraft featured exhaust shields and flame dampers (to reduce the emission of light during nigh flying), the Ruestsaetz 6 (R6) conversion kit (which incorporated a pair of MG 151 cannon in underwing gondolas), and was fitted with the FuG 350 Naxos Z electronic receiver. This receiver was capable of homing on the H2S radar used by the Royal Air Force pathfinder aircraft, allowing the Bf 109G-6/N not only to locate the Allied bomber stream without ground guidance, but also to vector other airborne Luftwaffe interceptor units to the target. For the installation of the FuG 350, a transparent hemispherical dome was fitted just aft of the cockpit and the D/F loop was relocated to the underside of the fuselage.\n\nThe Bf 109G-8, entering production in late 1943, was a photo-reconnaissance variant of the Bf 109G-6 and G-8 had given way to the Bf 109G-10, which was intended to standardize several of the Umruest-Bausatze modifications, including the wooden tailplane, MW 50 power boost system, and semi-retractable tailwheel assembly. Because of the numerous assembly plants engaged in producing the Bf 109G, however, and the limited availability of several of the components as a result of continuous Allied raids against the supplying plants, a formalized standard Bf 109G-10 was never achieved.\n\nThe Bf 109G-10 was powered by the DB 605D engine coupled with the MW 50 power boost system and delivered an impressive 1,850 hp at take-off. The new powerplant had been fitted with a larger diameter supercharger and the compression ratio was increased by 15% through redesign of the cylinders. The cowl-mounted MG 131 machine-guns were retained and either an engine-mounted MK 108 or MG 151 cannon incorporated, depending on supply. The G-10 also was fitted with the FuG 16ZY radio and FuG 25a IFF equipment, and a Revi 16B reflector gunsight replaced the previous Revi 12D.\n\nLike other variants of the Bf 109G series, the Bf 109G-10 was delivered in various sub-types which incorporated a number of Umruest-Bausatz and Ruestsaetze conversions.\n\nG-10/U2: Adaptation of the non-strategic wooden tailplane.\n\nG-10/U4: Adaptation of U2 wooden tailplane and the addition of a redesigned and enlarged rudder, also fabricated as a wooden structure.\n\nG-10/R1: Fighter-bomber adaptation with a ventral rack for carrying a single 250 kg (550 lb) SC 250 bomb or four 50 kg (110 lb) SC 50 bombs.\n\nG-10/R3: Extended range fighter with adaptation of fuselage rack for attachment of 300 lt (66 Imp gal) drop tank.\n\nG-10/R5: Interceptor with addition of a pair of underwing gondolas carrying 30-mm MK 108 short barrel cannon.\n\nG-10/R7: Although not designated as R7 due to more than one Ruestsaetze modification being used, the installation of the R7 location signal device saw wide usage on the G-10 series.\n\nOne of the more unique of the G-series variant was the Bf 109G-12 which was a two-seat training conversion of the basic Bf 109G airframe. Studies for this sub-type had been started with the Bf 109E version in 1940 (under the designation Bf 109S), but the concept had not been authorized until late 1942 when pilot training in the Bf 109 had been accelerated. For the prototype of this variant, a Bf 109G-5 was modified through removal of the pressurization equipment, and the incorporation of an elongated canopy with a second set of controls and pilot instruments. The canopy housing was hinged in the student’s location, with the aft portion being curved outward to five the instructor a better view. A large number of G-6 and G-6 aircraft were converted to the G-12 straight from the assembly line never became a reality due to the pressing need for increased fighter strength and the limited availability of components. One Ruestsatz that was added to the G-12 variants was the R3, which provided the training flights with increased range and endurance through the installation of the 300 lt (66 Imp gal) auxiliary fuel drop tanks.\n\nBy July, 1944, still a further variant of the Bf 109G series was being delivered to the Luftwaffe, this being the Bf 109G-14. Utilizing the DB 605AS or DB 605AM powerplants, and standardized in the incorporation of the “Galland” type canopy first used on the G-5, the G-14 was armed with the pair of cowl-mounted MG 131 machine-guns and an engine-mounted 20-mm MG 151 cannon. Although only a limited number of this variant were produced due to the impending introduction of the Bf 109K, several modifications were adapted including theU4, U6, R1, R3 and R6. The U6 conversion was the installation of the longer barrel 30-mm MK 103 cannon as an engine-mounted weapon in place of the 20-mm MG 151.\n\nThe final production variant of the Bf 109G series was the G-16, which was essentially identical to the G-14 except that it reverted back to use the DB 605D powerplant and had standardized installation of the R1 (ventral bomb or drop tank rack) and R6 (underwing mounted 20-mm MG 151 cannon in gondolas) at the factory.\n\nBf 109G-6 Specifications\n\nBf 109G Illustrations\n\nBf 109H series\n\nThe Bf 109H was the result of a proposal by Messerschmitt A.G. to the RLM to provide a high-performance high altitude interceptor. The request from the German Air Ministry in early 1943 was based on the increasing need of the Luftwaffe for a fighter plane that could intercept and combat the Allied bombers at high altitudes, or use the advantage of altitude for escape or to surprise the enemy.\n\nThe Hochleistungsjaeger (High performance fighter) was proposed to be produced in two separate phases. First, an interim or temporary aircraft would be delivered to the Luftwaffe to provide capabilities during the design and development of the advanced, or second phase, fighter. The Bf 109H was proposed to serve as the interim aircraft.\n\nThe original Bf 109H was almost identical to the Bf 109F, utilizing the basic airframe, but had an extended center section of the wing which increased surface area for high altitude operation. However, changing RLM requirements during 1943, especially increases in operating altitudes, resulted in the abandonment of the original Bf 109H concept. Instead, an alternate Messerschmitt proposal was made to proceed on the Me 209-II programme which was to incorporate either a DB 628A or DB 603E powerplant. These engines were specifically developed with turbo-supercharger for high altitude operations.\n\nRealizing that Messerschmitt could not deliver the Me 209-II before 1944, and recognizing the importance of receiving a new interceptor as soon as possible, the RLM instructed Messerschmitt to proceed with the basic Bf 109H program, but to modify the configuration to utilize several of the Me 209-II components, including the DB 628A engine. Due to the fact that a Bf 109G airframe had already been modified to accept a mock-up of the DB 628A powerplant as a prototype (Bf 109 V49) and proved the concept’s feasibility for the Me 209-II project, a second Bf 109G airframe was diverted from the assembly line (designated Bf 109 V50) and installed with a development engine for flight testing.\n\nBeing nearly 180 kg (400 lbs) heavier and some 60 cm (2 ft) longer than the standard DB 605 powerplant used in the Bf 109G, installation of the DB 628A into the Bf 109H prototype required the use of balance weights in the aft fuselage to insure maintaining of the aircraft center-of-gravity. This was to be compensated for in later models through the forward movement of the main wing attach points and an increase in the tail and rudder surfaces.\n\nAfter initial flight trials at Augsburg , the V50 was transferred to Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz AG was a German manufacturer of motor vehicles and internal combustion engines, which was founded in 1926. An Agreement of Mutual Interest – which was valid until 2000 – was signed on 1 May 1924 between Karl Benz's Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, which had been founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Daimler had died in 1900, and Maybach had left in 1907.\n\nBoth companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged - becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) - and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of \"Mercedes-Benz\" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.\n\nAlthough Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of aircraft, tank, and submarine engines. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for the Mauser rifle. During World War II, Daimler-Benz employed slave labour. for extended duration and altitude testing of the engine. While the testing of the V50 aircraft continued near Stuttgart , the Augsburg facility modified still another Bf 109G, under the designation Bf 109 V54, installing a DB 628 powerplant and incorporating the increased center wing section and tail surfaces.\n\nIn the meantime, while the testing of the new engine was being conducted at both Stuttgart and Augsburg, Messerschmitt initiated assembly of a number of modified Bf 109Fs under the designation Bf 109H-0 to conduct limit load tests of the widened undercarriage and increased surface areas. A number of Bf 109H-1s also were initiated and earmarked for delivery to the Luftwaffe for service evaluation. These aircraft utilized the DB 605A engine with the GM 1 injectant boost system.\n\nThe Bf 109H-1s were delivered to a Luftwaffe evaluation unit near Paris in early 1944, and while general handling characteristics were acceptable, the aircraft did exhibit a serious wing flutter in diving attitudes at high speed. To try and determine the cause and correction for the wing flutter, a number of Bf 109H-1s were returned to Augsburg for company testing and evaluation. During one of these tests, in April, 1944, the test pilot encountered the problem during a steep dive and pulled up sharply. In the pull-up the aircraft’s wing was torn off. Limited testing continued on the aircraft; however, within the month, the Bf 109H program was cancelled and the RLM selected the Fucke-Wulf Ta 152H for the high-altitude interceptor role.\n\nSeveral additional proposals were offered by Messerschmitt based on the Bf 109H, including the H-2 (fitted with a Junkers Jumo 213E powerplant with GM 1 injection, engine-mounted 30-mm MK 103 cannon and a pair of wing-mounted 20-mm 151 cannon), the H-3 (fitted with the Jumo 213E engine and armed with a centre firing 30-mm MK 108 cannon and a pair of wing-mounted 13-mm MG 131 machine-guns), and the H-4 (reconnaissance aircraft with a camera installation in the aft fuselage). However, none of these proposals were ever accepted by the RLM for prototyping or development due to the success being enjoyed by both the FW 190D and Ta 152H.\n\nBf 109H-1 Specifications\n\nBf 109H-1 Illustration\n\nBf 109K series\n\nThe Bf 109K was the product of a standardization policy instituted by the RLM to reduce the number of variants and sub-types in the various basic airframes in use by the Luftwaffe. The plan was to select a basic variant, incorporating all the improvements that had evolved through the earlier sub-types, and establish a standard aircraft which would be manufactured by each of the aircraft plants involved in that particular design.\n\nThe Bf 109K was such an aircraft, and was based on the Bf 109G-10 variant, incorporating a number of the Umruest-Bausatz as well as several minor aerodynamic external features to improve streamlining. The pre-preduction aircraft, designated Bf 109K-0 for service evaluation and acceptance, were similar to the late G-series production aircraft, but differed in that they had a raised cowling line just forward of the cockpit, a lengthened spinner, installation of the “Galland” type canopy, an enlarged tail assembly, and a fully retractable tailwheel which utilized a longer strut to raise the tail higher during take-offs and allow the pilot increased visibility in a forward attitude, and a modified rudder. In addition to the testing of the standardized G-10 armament of the nose-mounted 20-mm MG 151 cannon and cowling-mounted 13-mm MG 131 machine-guns, the K-0 prototypes also were evaluated with the incorporation of either a 30-mm MK 103 or and MK 108 nose-mounted cannon (the primary difference in the MK 103 and MK 108 was in the length of the barrel) and a pair of cowling-mounted 15-mm MG 151 machine-guns. The powerplant for the Bf 109K-0 was the DB 605B and included the installation of the GM 1 injectant boost system.\n\nThe initial production batch of K-series aircraft to be delivered consisted of both the Bf 109K-2 and Bf 109K-4 models. Powered by either the DB 605 ASC or DB 605 DC engines rated at 2,000 hp for take-off and incorporating the GM 1 boost system, the K-2 and K-4 incorporated the modifications noted for the pre-production aircraft and standardized on the 30-mm nose cannon in combination with a pair of 15-mm MG 151 machine-guns. The only difference in the two models was in the installation of a pressurized cockpit into the K-4 model.\n\nRuestsaetze utilized on the Bf 109K-2 and K-4 models included the R1, R2 and R3 which provided the aircraft the capabilities of adapting to the fighter-bomber role with the use of the ETC racks (R1 and R2) or the long range interceptor role with the R3 addition of the 300 lt (66 Imp gal) ventraly-mounted drop tank.\n\nWith deliveries of the Bf 109K-2 and K-4 beginning in October, 1944, Messerschmitt undertook a further refinement of the basic K-series airframe to be used as a high-altitude bomber-interceptor. The designation assigned to this aircraft was Bf 109K-6. The aircraft was similar to the K-4, but reverted back to the 13-mm MG 131 fuselage mounted machine-guns and was fitted with a pair of 30-mm MK 108 cannons in the wings for added firepower, had a BSK 16 gun-camera installed inboard of the port wing cannon, and was equipped with a FuG 16ZY with underwing long range antenna on the port side.\n\nA pair of Ruestsaetze were also available and utilized on the Bf 109K-6. These included the R3 [300 lt (66 Imp gal) center mounted auxiliary fuel drop tank] and the R5 (30-mm MK 108 short barrel cannon in underwing gondolas). Both field conversions were rare and of an experimental nature dude to the limited number of Bf 109K-6s delivered prior to the cessation of hostilities.\n\nThe Bf 109K-8 was produced as a photo-reconnaissance version of the K-6 variant, being fitted with a Rb 50/30 camera in the aft fuselage and fabricated without the fuselage mounted machine-guns, the cowling being faired over the gun throughs. These aircraft were scheduled to being production during the early spring of 1945, however, with the end of the war, only a few of this variant ever left the assembly line.\n\nThe Bf 109K-10 variant represented a simple change in armament from the K-4 and the addition of one or more field conversions. Powered by the DB 601D engine, the K-10 was fitted with a pair of fuselage-mounted MG 131 machine-guns and a nose-mounted MK 103 cannon, and like the K-6 was fitted with a BSK gun camera and the FuG 16ZY radio equipment. Conversion kits added to the few examples of this model to reach operational units included the auxiliary drop tank (R3), wing pylons for attachment of a pair of 300 lt (66 Imp gal) jettisonable fuel tank (R4), and a pair of underwing 30-mm MK 108 short barrel cannon in gondolas (R5).\n\nThe final variant of the K-series to be produced was the Bf 109K-14 which reached operational Luftwaffe units during the last two weeks of the war. It was fitted with a DB 601L powerplant with a two-stage supercharger, offering over 1,700 hp at take-off with the use of 96 octane fuel. The obvious advantages of the new powerplant, which also made use of the MW 50 boost system, was that it could attain airspeeds of over 720 km/h (450 mph) at altitudes in excess of 10,700 m (35,000 ft).\n\nThe only drawback of the Bf 109K-14 was in its armament which, like on the K-8, was limited to a pair of fuselage-mounted MG 131 machine-guns and a single nose-mounted MK 103 or MK 108 cannon. Like the earlier models of the K-series, the K-14 also incorporated the D/F loop and FuG 16ZY antenna to supplement the normal radio mast behind the cockpit, and was fitted with the Revi 16B reflector gunsight.\n\nBf 109K-4 Specifications\n\nBf 109K Illustrations\n\nBf 109L series\n\nNever intended as a Bf 109 variant, Bf 109L was the result of the cancellation of the Me 209 program at the Messerschmitt plant at Augsburg. The Me 209 program had been initiated in 1943 with the proposal for the mating of the new Jumo 213E-1 powerplant with a Bf 109F-1 airframe. By the spring of 1944 the prototype, designated Me 209 V6 was ready for flight testing. However, because of the success and progress of the Fw 109D and Ta 152H, the entire Me 209 program was halted.\n\nNot willing to concede the production of the new high-performance high altitude fighter to Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt decided to proceed with his project, changing the aircraft’s designation to the Bf 109L. However, due to pressing production needs of the Bf 109G, and the work being conducted with the Bf 109H, no further efforts were expended on the Bf 109L.\n\nBf 109S series\n\nThe Bf 109S was the designation that resulted from a Messerschmitt project to transform the Bf 109E into a two place trainer. No immediate need was forecast for its use by the RLM and "
