Included were commentaries from scholars Caroline Levine (Cornell University), Uri McMillan (University of California, Los Angeles), Peter Szendy (Brown University), and Alexander Weheliye (Brown University).\n\nThis series, curated by anthropologist Rebecca Louise Carter, emerged from the Collaborative Humanities seminar “Experimental Ethnography for the Masses” and highlighted creative and multi-modal ethnographic approaches and their relevance and application to humanistic social inquiry."
