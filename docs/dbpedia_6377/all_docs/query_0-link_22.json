        "text": "I'm trying to buy memoirs of WW2 German aces. I already bought memoirs of Adolf Galland, Walter Schuck and Helmut Lipfert, and ordered Hans-Ekkehard bob.(These books already translated to English.) And also I bought \"The German Aces Speak I, II\", \"The Me262 Strombird\" and some other books few years ago. I think I have to buy some none-translated German books(Maybe someone who have interest about this will translate for me. hehe.). So I made some list.\n\nFalkenjahre - Wolfgang Falck\n\nFeindberührungen - Julius Meimberg\n\nUnbekannte Pflicht - Walter Wolfrum\n\nWalter Krupinski - Walter Krupinski\n\nGefechtsbericht - Günther Josten\n\nDie Fährte des Jägers - Adolf Dickfeld\n\nKriegstagebuch von Hannes Trautloft - Hannes Trautloft\n\nRammjäger - Walther Dahl\n\nNächte im Bomberstrom - Paul Zorner\n\nSand und Feuer - Martin Drewes\n\nAm Himmel Europas - Günther Scholz\n\nDer Jagdflieger Viktor Petermann - Viktor Petermann\n\nWir kämpften in einsamen Höhen - Peter Düttmann\n\nWo wir sind ist immer oben - Heinz Ewald\n\nIf somebody who know any memoirs or interview books not in the list, please notice me. Especially, I cannot find any books about Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert. He was great fighter pilot in both front and rejoined to Bundeswehr luftwaffe after war. I cannot understand why I couldn't find any book about him.\n\nIn English:\n\n'The Last Battle' , Peter Henn gives a German view of the MTO. Henn was Alfons Schertl.\n\n'Spitfire on my Tail', Ulrich Steinhilper\n\nYou didn't mention 'Jagdgeschwader 301/302' by the recently deceased Willi Reschke.\n\nI'll try to think of some more.\n\nI notice you have some of the worst memoirs/biogs ever written in your list. The Hartmann and Rudel books go without saying, but Dahl's 'Rammjager' must be up there along with some of the others\n\nCheers\n\nSteve"
