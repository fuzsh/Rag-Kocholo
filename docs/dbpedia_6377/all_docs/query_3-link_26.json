        "text": "Month: June 2020\n\nFine Molds Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-4 Trop of Hans-Jochim Marseille in 1/72 Scale\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4 Trop of 3. / JG 27, Ain El Gazala Libya, June 1942, pilot Hans-Jochim Marseille, Fine Molds kit.\n\nBerliner Hans-Jochim Marseille was widely known as one of the best marksmen in the Luftwaffe, and one who had perfected the art of deflection shooting. His preferred tactic was to engage enemy aircraft while flying at a reduced speed to maximize maneuverability and concentrate his fire on the forward fuselage, where both the engine and pilot were located. He was shot down himself on several occasions (including twice by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis, a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF) and lost additional aircraft due to mechanical difficulties. Marseille was a playboy and a major disciplinary problem for his commanders, but was highly effective in aerial combat. He was officially credited with 158 victories. On 30SEP42 Marseille was killed while bailing out after the Bf 109 G-2 he was flying developed engine trouble.\n\nShooter Book Review\n\nShooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper\n\nBy Jack Coughlin and Casey Kuhlman with Donald A. Davis\n\nHardcover in dustjacket, 320 pages, photographs, indexed\n\nPublished by St. Martin’s Press, May 2005\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 0312336853\n\nISBN-13: 978-0312336851\n\nDimensions: 6.3 x 1.1 x 9.4 inches\n\nShooter is the story of U.S. Marine Staff Sargent Jack Coughlin, told in his own words. SSGT Coughlin is a sniper. The book opens with an engagement in Mogadishu, Somalia against Somali militia. Next are a few chapters focusing on training, exercises, and base life. Then more training after 9/11 and deployment with the 1st Marine Division and the war in Iraq.\n\nThe bulk of the book focuses on Coughlin’s experiences in the three weeks it took his unit, the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment to reach Baghdad from their starting point in Kuwait. He chaffed at his position within the Headquarters and Services Company and clashed with his Company Commander, but had the respect of his Battalion Commander. While he was arguably one of the most experienced snipers within the Battalion, while assigned to the H&S Company his job was not sniping. He was often able to get into the thick of the action with his own small support team however, and usually with the support (and even insistence) of the Battalion CO.\n\nThis is very much a “boots on the ground” narrative, with Coughlin describing details of each action, what he did, what he saw, and what he felt – both good and bad. The Marines lived in their vehicles and endured heat, sandstorms, and MREs while under constant threat of attack by chemical weapons and the regular Iraqi Army, along with ambushes by irregular forces.\n\nThis was a very fast read for me as I enjoy this type of book. It is full of Marine bravado and pulls no punches on the descriptions of combat and the specific tactics used to achieve each objective. An engaging account, recommend.\n\nMikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrum Walk Around\n\nPhotographs taken in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2006, contributed by David Knights.\n\nPart II here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/mikoyan-mig-29-walk-around-second-aircraft/\n\nWomen Warriors 71\n\nTo see more Women Warriors, click on the tags below:\n\nPlastic Soldier StuG III Ausf. G Assault Gun Build in 1/72 Scale Part II\n\nPart III here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/07/03/plastic-soldier-stug-iii-ausf-g-assault-gun-build-in-1-72-scale-part-iii/\n\nSpecial Hobby Curtiss P-40E Warhawk 343rd Fighter Group Aleutian Tigers in 1/72 Scale\n\nThis is the excellent Special Hobby P-40E Warhawk kit with markings from DK Decals Aleutian Planes sheet 72030. The aircraft is one of those assigned to the 11th Fighter Squadron 343rd Fighter Group seen at Adak, Alaska in the Summer of 1943. I added some detail to the cockpit and installed the canvas dust covers in the wheelwells using masking tape but other than that did very little to the kit. The P-40s in the Aleutians suffered an extreme amount of paint wear at the wing roots. One problem with the camouflage is this particular aircraft did not have the Medium Green spots on the upper surface, an error on my part.\n\nMore completed P-40s here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/07/02/special-hobby-curtiss-p-40k-1-warhawk-of-1lt-robert-overcash-in-1-72-scale/\n\nRussian Federation Submarine Rescue Ship Kommuna\n\nFine Molds Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-4 Trop of Gustav Rödel in 1/72 Scale\n\nGustav Rödel was a veteran of the Condor Legion in Spain. On the first day of the Second World War he was credited with a Polish PZL P.24. He fought in the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and in Greece, filing claims in all three. He briefly participated in Operation Barbarossa, filing a single claim against an SB bomber before 4./JG 27 was transferred to North Africa. Rödel survived the war with a total of 98 victories, including 52 in the Mediterranean and 13 Viermots.\n\nLuftwaffe in Africa Book Review\n\nLuftwaffe in Africa, 1941-1943\n\nBy Jean-Louis Roba\n\nPaperback, 128 pages, heavily illustrated, index\n\nPublished by Casemate, November 2019\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1612007457\n\nISBN-13: 978-1-61200-7458\n\nProduct Dimensions: 7.0 x 0.5 x 10.0 inches\n\nGermany was drawn into the war in North Africa by Mussolini’s ambitions. Italy had little to gain by conquering the region; Germany even less so. For the German Army and particularly the Luftwaffe North Africa did little more than provide an ever-increasing drain on assets which could have been better used in the Soviet Union. Once the influx of American men and material began to be felt the Axis cause was beyond redemption.\n\nThis volume provides a good overview of the progression of the campaign in North Africa from the Luftwaffe perspective. There were quite a large number of units committed over time but Germany was never able to achieve the concentration of force necessary to achieve her goals, attempts to supply the Africa Korps by air transport proving particularly costly. Roba does a good job of tracking the constant redeployments, and describes the results of the major air actions as the campaign progressed. Also included is the commitment of the Luftwaffe’s Fallschrimjäger. The LRDG attacks of Luftwaffe airfields are mentioned as well but only briefly. In the last third of the book there are several first-hand accounts from pilots which are interesting, although one from Arman Köhler’s diary appears to have been inadvertently omitted.\n\nThere are quite a number of photographs reproduced in this book, many of which were new to me. They include some original color examples which are presented well and are generally well captioned. There are also fifteen very nicely done color profiles, but these have only the briefest of descriptions.\n\nOverall a nice presentation and a quick read. A few first-hand accounts in the beginning of the book would have been welcome, but this book provides a good overview of the campaign."
