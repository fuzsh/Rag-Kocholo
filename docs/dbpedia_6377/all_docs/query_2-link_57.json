        "text": "This comprehensive catalogue documents the installation of Isa Genzken’s eponymous exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin (13 July - 27 November 2023). Alongside many photographs, the catalogue assembles texts by Dieter Schwarz, Sabine Breitwieser, Manfred Hermes, Tom McDonough, Juliane Rebentisch, Isa Genzken, conversations with Isa Genzken and Wolfgang Tillmans, and Isa Genzken and Diedrich Diederichsen, a preface by Klaus Biesenbach and Lisa Botti, and a new essay by Diedrich Diederichsen. The texts are in German or English language. The catalogue is designed by Julie Peeters, edited by Daniel Buchholz and Christopher Müller, and published by Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther und Franz König and Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin.\n\nEdited by Ciarán Finlayson, Scott Portnoy, Robert Snowden and designed by Julie Peeters, this photobook is the first publication on Curtis Cuffie. It seeks to honor the artist by collecting the efforts of two of his partners: Carol Thompson, who lived with Cuffie from 1996 to 2001 and archived a great number of his 35mm photographs, and Katy Abel, a Cooper Square resident who took hundreds of snapshots of his art as it was seen on the streets. The book features writing by the artist, Ciarán Finlayson, and Alan Moore, and additional images taken by Tom Warren and Margaret Morton. It is published by Blank Forms Editions with support from Galerie Buchholz.\n\nThe Books and Life of Raymond Roussel is a biographic and bibliographic study of the French author Raymond Roussel (1877-1933). It was researched and written by the art historian Michael Sanchez. The book takes the form of an inventory of every known state of every edition of Roussel’s lifetime publications. Interwoven into this bibliographic data are texts that analyze the relationship between Roussel’s literary procedures, the material construction of his books, and his life. The book also includes a list of primary and secondary literature related to Roussel.\n\nThis catalogue is published on the occasion of the exhibitions at the Schindler House/MAK Center for Art and Architecture, Los Angeles and at our gallery in Berlin. It is designed by Florian Pumhösl and contains images of the installation at Schindler House and documentation of the exhibited works along with an introductory text by MAK curator Bärbel Vischer and a conversation between Vincent Fecteau and Florian Pumhösl.\n\nThis first volume of the Michael Krebber catalogue raisonné compiles the artist’s work in all media from 1972 to 2000. Prepared by Michael Sanchez, the book includes photographs, material descriptions, and provenance of Krebber’s paintings, works on paper, and film from this period. In addition to an introduction and short texts on individual works, the catalogue raisonné features a full biography, bibliography, and extensive documentation of his early exhibitions, many of which have not been published before. This book is co-published by Galerie Buchholz, Greene Naftali and the Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther und Franz König.\n\nThis book focuses on the extraordinary mythical traditions and ritual practices in a remote community in the Himalayan mountains, studied over a long period of field research by Michael Oppitz. It is the English version of his German original, first published in 1981 by Syndikat Verlag under the title “Schamanen im Blinden Land,” which has long since been out of print. That book came out in parallel to a film of the same name, today considered a classic. Now appearing in English as “Shamans of the Blind Country. A picture book from the Himalaya” the new version extends the old by more than a third of the original documentary photographs; it traces the historical changes that have transformed this mountainous region of Nepal over the last four decades in an extensive epilogue; and it suggests a wider context of ritual healing in the Himalaya by appending a selection of early pictures of shamanism in Siberia. This English version is published in both hardcover and softcover editions.\n\nThis book originated out of an exhibition that Moyra Davey organized at Galerie Buchholz in Berlin. For this, Moyra Davey delved into Peter Hujar’s archives and emerged mainly with little-known, scarcely seen images. In response to these, Davey created her own images that draw out an idiosyncratic selection of shared subjects. Side by side, the powerfully composed images admire, tease, and enhance one another in the manner of fierce friends, forming a visual exploration of physicality and sexuality that crackles with wit, tenderness, and perspicacity. Spiritually anchored in New York City - even as they range out to rural corners of Quebec and Pennsylvania - these images crystallize tensions between city and country, human and animal. Nudes pose with unruly chickens; human bodies are abstracted toward topography; seascapes and urban landscapes share the same tremulous plasticity. These continuities are punctuated by stark differences of approach: Davey’s self-aware postmodernism against Hujar’s humanism and embrace of darkroom manipulation. The rich dialogue between these photographs is personal and angular, ultimately offering an illuminating reintroduction to each artist through communion with the other’s work. The book contains a new text by Eileen Myles and is published by Mack Books, London.\n\nThis new publication revisits Silke Otto-Knapp’s exhibition at the Renaissance Society that took place in Spring 2020 with installation shots and large images of individual works on foldout pages. It contains new essays by Carol Armstrong, Darby English, Rachel Hann, and Catriona MacLeod, as well as a conversation between Otto-Knapp and curator Solveig Øvstebø. The book is published by The Renaissance Society at the University Chicago.\n\nThis new artist’s book is dedicated exclusively to Wolfgang Tillmans’ ‘Silver’ works. The book gives a comprehensive overview of these abstract works, from their first appearance in the artist’s oeuvre in the early 90’s through to today. It includes a new text by Tom Holert on this body of work, as well as a conversation between Wolfgang Tillmans and the photo engineer Klaus Pollmeier, who met in the artist’s studio and discussed the photo-technical details, observations, chance operations and unintentional accidents that are at work in the formation process of the ‘Silver’ pictures. It is available in both German and English editions. Kindly supported by Stiftung Kunstfonds NEUSTART KULTUR.\n\nFor his artist’s book “My Own Personal Bess” Richard Hawkins has overlaid reproductions of Forrest Bess’s paintings into pages of the seminal 1981 Texas Monthly article “His Name Was Forrest Bess” by Michael Ennis. This book is published on the occasion of the exhibition Forrest Bess at Fridericianum, Kassel. It contains full bleed images of 12 collages together with a text by Richard Hawkins.\n\nJutta Koether’s new artist book, “Libertine”, documents and interprets her eponymous exhibition at Museum Abteiberg, a major installation that delved into the museum’s history. The artist designed the book, presenting her latest series of paintings from 2018 to 2020 and their intersection with central works in the collection of Museum Abteiberg. The second part of the book contains a dossier of materials from Jutta Koether’s studio. New texts by Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, Jenny Nachtigall and Nathan Stobaugh and Susanne Titz offer a comprehensive art historical exploration. The book is publsihed by Museum Abteiberg Mönchengladbach and Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther und Franz König.\n\nThe book introduces Isa Genzken’s complete 42 projects for outdoor sculptures, from the years 1984-2016. Each project is extensively illustrated, with accompanying texts by Manfred Hermes both in German and English. In addition, the book contains an introductory text by Susanne Kleine (also in German and English), which was written for the exhibition “Isa Genzken: Models for Outdoor Projects”, held at the Bundeskunsthalle Bonn in 2016.\n\nThis artist’s book completes Monica Majoli’s Black Mirror series and acts as a pendant to the suite of paintings and works on paper produced from 2009-2012 and exhibited at L&M Arts in Los Angeles, 2012-2013. This particular series is based on the black mirror panels of Majoli’s bedroom, reflecting the half-images of five lovers from her past (over the timespan of twenty-five years). The book’s photographs are both source material and event. They depict an intimate performance between the artist and her subject as reflected in the dark mirrored surface that the camera captures.\n\nPoet, novelist and cultural critic Wayne Koestenbaum contributed nine texts to the book. His feuilletons or soap operas act as a disorienting, poetic, and freewheeling counterpoint of conjecture to the photographs. The book also examines creating the material for the paintings in an extended interview between Majoli and independent writer and critic Sabrina Tarasoff.\n\nThe book is published in collaboration with Air de Paris.\n\nThis publication is the first collection of Tony Conrad’s writings. Edited by Constance DeJong and Andrew Lampert, the book spans the years 1961-2012 and includes fifty-seven pieces: essays originally published in small press magazines, exhibition catalogues, anthologies, and album liner notes, along with other previously unpublished texts. Conrad writes about his own works: The Flicker, Loose Connection, Four Violins, Articulation of Boolean Algebra for Film Opticals, Early Minimalism, Yellow Movies, Slapping Pythagoras, and Music and the Mind of the World; as well as on the work of his peers: Tony Oursler, Jack Smith, Rhys Chatham, and Henry Flynt, among others. He devotes critical essays to horology, neurolinguistics, and the historical development of Western music, television advertising and camouflage. He also writes on media activism, network communications, censorship, and the political and cultural implications of corporate and global media. The book is published by Primary Information.\n\nSpanning more than three decades, “In Part” brings together a full spectrum of the New York-based artist, writer and activist Julie Ault’s published texts through selected extracts in a single volume. Reprinted in chronological sequence alongside a selection of full-length texts, this series of excerpts offers a timeline of Ault’s artistic development, longstanding political concerns and dynamic interpersonal affinities. The book is edited by Julie Ault and Nicolas Linnert and has an introductory text by Lucy R. Lippard. The book is published in collaboration of Dancing Foxes Press and Galerie Buchholz.\n\nThis latest book by the artist Moyra Davey is based on two related group of works, Les Goddesses (2011) and Hemlock Forest (2016), which each take form through text, photography, and film. Layering introspection and personal narratives with meditations on the lives and works of other writers, filmmakers, and artists—ranging from 18th-century feminist writer and activist Mary Wollstonecraft to Chantal Akerman, and Moyra Davey’s own five sisters.

Starting from the installation and series of glass paintings entitled “Modernology”, it reflects the artists ongoing involvement with motifs, issues and materials of early non-western avantgardes. While Sabeth Buchmann and Jan Verwoert are discussing Florian Pumhösl’s works and strategies from two different perspectives, Thomas Hackner’s contribution provides an insight into the work of Japanese book artist Onchi Koshiro, whose abstract formal language has become both source and subject of Pumhösl’s mode of depiction.\n\nSpecial edition: Catalogue in slipcase with sign. and num. photograph.
