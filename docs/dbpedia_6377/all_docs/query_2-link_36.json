        "text": "Steering the Future of AI\n\nMarch 28 – 31, 2019 | 1440 Multiversity | Tuition $495\n\nToday many of the concepts, consequences, and possibilities involved in a future with advanced AI feel distant, uncertain, and abstract. No one has all the answers about how to ensure that powerful AI in the future is beneficial, either in terms of technical implementation or in terms of transference to the domains of law, regulations and policy, industry best practices, or society at large. There are a number of organizations and initiatives that are working on the issues of AI safety, ethics, and governance.\n\nJoining these efforts with a distinct role that bridges academia and industry, the Augmented Intelligence Summit offers a unique, inter-disciplinary approach to learning and creating solutions in this space. We ask: is it possible to develop a collective, concrete, realistic vision of a positive AI future that can inform policy, the development of the industry, and academic research, and can it be done inclusively? Our hypothesis is that this is indeed possible, and we have designed an experiment to test it.\n\nThe Summit will provide the tools and framework for a multi-disciplinary group of policy, research, and business leaders to imagine and interact with a simulated model of a positive future for our global society and its major interconnected systems – the economy, education, work, and political structures – through the lens of advanced AI. AIS utilizes a range of collaborative design tools and immersive exercises, including:\n\nScenario simulation, war-game style\n\nWorld building and collaborative strategic planning exercises\n\nPresentations on models of economic, social and complex systems to inform our work\n\nThe Summit’s high-level goals are about increasing systems-literacy and improving long-term thinking and decision making, which we see as critical skills for navigating the future of advanced AI and its impact on society. In addition to presentations on the state of AI and its trajectory, immersive exercises at the Summit relate to a fictional future world with advanced AI that is both plausible and aspirational. By mentally committing to a specific version of the future, our creativity, our ability to identify important variables, and our overall problem-solving capacity can be enhanced to help us better imagine the societal challenges, opportunities, and needs that will face us and the planning that must be done.\n\nFeatured Speakers\n\nMax Tegmark\n\nMIT | FLI\n\nDavid Krakauer\n\nSanta Fe Institute\n\nAllison Duettmann\n\nForesight Institute\n\nStuart Russell\n\nUC Berkeley | CHAI\n\nGaia Dempsey\n\n7th Future\n\nPeter Eckersley\n\nPartnership on AI\n\nMarie-Therese Png\n\nOxford | DeepMind\n\nAnthony Aguirre\n\nUC Santa Cruz | FLI | FXQi\n\nMarc Fleurbaey\n\nPrinceton\n\nAriel Conn\n\nFLI\n\nMichael Page\n\nCenter for Security and Emerging Technology\n\nMeia Chita-Tegmark\n\nTufts | FLI\n\nDavid Haussler\n\nUC Santa Cruz | QB3\n\nShahar Avin\n\nCSER\n\nLou Viquerat de Kerhuelvez\n\nForesight Institute\n\nBios for the speakers can be found here.\n\nAgenda\n\nThursday, March 28th\n\n5:30 pm – 9:00 pm\n\nOpening Keynote: Modeling, Simulation & Changing the Rules of the Game | Gaia Dempsey\n\nGaia Dempsey is an entrepreneur and pioneer in the field of augmented reality (AR).
