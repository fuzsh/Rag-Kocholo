        "text": "Wolf-Dietrich Huy claimed his first victory on 13MAY40, a Spitfire. He flew Jabo (attack) missions in Greece, where he led his Staffel in attacks against shipping and British warships, including the successful attacks against the battleship HMS Warspite and cruiser HMS Fiji. JG 77 was deployed to the East for Operation Barbarossa, where Huy continued to score steadily against Soviet aircraft. On 11MAR42 he was credited with his 38th victory, but was wounded by German ground fire.\n\nFollowing his recovery from wounds, III. Gruppe was redeployed to the Mediterranean. He was able to claim a Spitfire on 28OCT42 for his 40th victory but was shot down the following day by a Spitfire from No. 601 Squadron piloted by P/O J.H. Nicholls. Huy was captured and spent the rest of the war as a PoW.\n\nThe model the Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/R6 of Hauptman Wolf-Dietrich Huy, 7./JG 77, Tanyet Harun, Egypt, October 1942.\n\nPeter Düttmann was one of the later arrivals to JG 52, joining the Group in May of 1943 just a few weeks before his twentieth birthday. He quickly found his footing and was credited with his first victory, a Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, on 21MAY43. He was an aggressive pilot who scored steadily, but was himself shot down several times, including three times in one day on 23JAN44. His best day was on 07MAY44 when he was credited with nine aerial victories during two sorties.\n\nDüttmann survived the war and was credited with a total of 152 victories. Although he himself was shot down several times, he always managed to evade capture and walk back to German lines. Peter Düttmann survived the war and passed away in January 2001.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109G-4/R6 of Uffz. Peter Düttmann, 5./JG 52, Russia, July 1943\n\nWerner Schröer was already trained as a pilot when the Second World War began. In August 1940 he was posted to Jagdgeswader 27 on the Channel Front. There he claimed three victories but none of these were confirmed. JG 27 was transferred to North Africa, where Schröer finally received credit for his first victory, a RAF Hurricane on 19APR41. However, Schröer’s Messerschmitt was also damaged in this encounter and he made a forced landing, making his aircraft the first Bf 109 shot down in the African Theater. Two days later he was back in combat, but was again shot down. Ironically, there is some evidence that on both occasions Schröer was downed by the same pilot, a Pilot Officer Spence.\n\nHe remained in combat, but only scored sporadically until he was promoted to Staffelkapitän of 8./JG 27 in June, 1942. By the time JG 27 withdrew to Italy in November he was the second highest scorer in North Africa with 61 victories, behind only Hans-Jochim Marseille who had 158 victories when he was killed. In Italy Schröer was promoted to Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 27 and continued to score until the Gruppe was withdrawn to Germany. There they were assigned to Defense of the Reich duties operating against the American heavy bomber streams which were gaining in strength. In April 1944 the Gruppe gave up its Messerschmitts and transitioned to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. These were used as fighter-bombers over the Invasion Front beginning in June 1944 where the unit was decimated. Schröer was posted to instructor duty, then as Kommodore of JG 3. He survived the war with 114 victories, including 26 heavy bombers and 12 Soviet aircraft.\n\nThe model depicts the Messerschmitt Bf 109F-4 of Oberleutnant Werner Schröer, 8./JG 27, while at Rhodes, Greece, November 1942.\n\n“Irmgard” was originally Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/R3 Trop W.Nr. 10605 assigned to 2.(H)/14. She was brought down by ground fire near Zaris, Tunisia on 20FEB43 while on a reconnaissance mission. Her pilot, a Leutnant Wernicke, successfully evaded capture.\n\nIrmgard was passed to the 86th Fighter Squadron, 79th Fighter Group. The 79th had a penchant for operating captured Axis aircraft, and they soon had restored her to airworthy condition. She was repainted in U.S. markings with high-visibility yellow undersides. Photographs show she was often flown by her new owners minus her canopy. Photographs of Irmgard here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/captured-messerschmitt-bf-109g-2-trop-irmgard-of-the-79th-fighter-group/\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109G-2/R2 “Irmgard” of the 79th Fighter Group, Zarzis, Tunisia, Spring 1943. Eduard kit, decals are Exotic Decals from Poland.\n\nViktor Bauer opened his account on 15MAY40 with a victory over an RAF Hurricane. He was to score a total of four victories in the West before JG 3 was withdrawn and re-equipped with the Bf 109F-2 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa.\n\nBauer scored heavily against the Russians, downing 15 Soviet aircraft during the first month of the war in the East, including 5 SB-2 bombers on 26JUN41. On 23JUL41 his Messerschmitt was hit by defensive fire from a DB-3 bomber, Bauer attempted a crash landing but was severely injured. He did not return to combat until February 1942. He continued to score regularly until 10AUG42, when his Messerschmitt was again hit by defensive fire, wounding him again. After a lengthy convalescence, he was placed in command of a series of training units in France. While he was promoted regularly, eventually reaching the rank of Oberst (Colonel), he did not return to combat. He was credited with 106 victories during the war, and passed away in December 1969.\n\nThe model depicts the Bf 109F-4 of Oberleutnant Viktor Bauer, 9./JG 3, at Shchigry USSR, June 1942."
