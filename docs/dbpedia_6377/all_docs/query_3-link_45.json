        "text": "This paper reviews evidence for crisis-driven changes in human–climate relations in Europe ca. 1200 BC. That date occupies a broad focal point for the onset of changes visible in both social and climatic datasets that occurred within a few decades across a large and diverse region. This correlation has been extensively studied for the eastern Mediterranean and engendered much debate regarding causal relations for collapsing states and empires. In prehistoric Europe, the first globalized and international age was at its peak ca. 1500–1200 BC (Vandkilde 2016). Then in the 12th century BC, many of the influential centers and cross-cultural connections that had defined this age were fundamentally transformed. This can be recognized across settlement, mortuary, landscape management, and material culture records.\n\nThis social transformation corresponds in time with the so-called 3.2 ka event recognized in paleoclimatology of the eastern Mediterranean. The possibility that this point in time marks a change in the relationship between social and climate trajectories has not yet been explored for Europe. While distinctly different from the large, complex social entities such as the Egyptian or the Hittite empires in the eastern Mediterranean, Europe was home to diverse societies, many of which were stratified and defined by the use of shared material culture and practices across extensive areas. Through absolute and relative dates, many of these societies have closely resolved chronologies and well-defined horizons of social change. We are also fortunate to have both extensive and diverse paleoclimatic archives covering later European prehistory. Here, I present a first synthetic, parallel overview of existing high-resolution paleoclimatic and archaeological research, both of which reveal that important changes took place during the later Bronze Age.\n\nTo do this, I focus on societies from each of the broad cultural zones of Europe in the later second millennium BC—the Atlantic, Nordic, Urnfield, Carpathian-Balkan, and Aegean areas. As such, this paper provides a review of published climatic, environmental, and archaeological studies in comparative perspective and, as a result, new insights into changing human–climate relations from the 13th to 12th centuries BC. The data indicate that one of the exceptional Holocene climate deviations can be detected in Europe in the decades around 1200 BC, synchronously affecting different regions and culturally distinct societies. I argue this climate change constituted a force multiplier that shaped the end points of social crises. This impact was particularly visible in some of Europe's most culturally influential societies, reconfiguring their own trajectories and their role in driving the regional-scale networks that were a defining characteristic of this epoch. I emphasize, however, that not all societies were equally affected and the very diversity that defined the landscapes of Europe raises \"the likelihood that climatic change causing chaos or challenge in one area may produce the opposite effect in another area\" (Knapp and Manning 2016, p. 111).\n\nPast climate change was a phenomenon that required societies to adapt and change—there can be no question about this. Our challenge is to define the scale, pace, and duration of change and to evaluate if particular instances were exceptional in long-term trends and/or in the context of neighboring areas. As this review of paleoclimatic data shows, it is not yet possible to reconstruct prehistoric rainfall and temperature patterns at a regional scale with high precision or accuracy. Nonetheless, by integrating a wide range of proxy data, it is possible to define broad patterns that occurred in different parts of Europe. A tentative northwest/southeast difference is also evident in the climate data. For each area, I argue that climate change was a cause of stressors that profoundly shaped how some societies negotiated crises, including their response to the collapse of political systems and long-distance networks. In other societies, climate change can be correlated with rising prosperity, yet the very process of centralization implying growth coupled with innovations in warfare reminds us that growth as well as collapse can lead to conflict in the wake of change.\n\nIn the areas reviewed, climate change data is viewed in combination with material evidence for societal resilience. I explore four specific points. (1) Indicators of a sharp change in climate, commonly manifested as increased aridity, occurred in the 12th century BC in areas of Europe dominated by different weather systems. The impact ranged from highly detrimental to beneficial depending on the case analyzed. (2) Social change unfolded over a century (or more), and this required the ongoing mediation of uncontrolled changes in environmental conditions (3) Rather than instigating crises, this change in human–climate relations constrained recovery and reconfiguration in the immediate wake of social crises or collapse in areas of Europe that had been home to comparatively complex societies. (4) This climate change horizon coincided with a significant decrease in connectivity between many parts of Europe along with changes to practices of warfare. These indicate that social stressors driving change in long-distance networks were widespread, potentially interrelated, and contemporaneous with climate change.\n\nIt Is Complicated: The Archaeology and Climate Change Relationship\n\nArchaeology has a long but uneasy relationship with paleoclimate research. A tendency for studies to focus on human–climate relations during periods of rapid change in either dataset commonly biases discussion toward exceptional scenarios. I consciously accommodate this bias due to the wealth of suitable data for testing the principle of a “prehistory of climate and society” in Europe, to expand on Degroot et al.’s (2021) recent manifesto for History of Climate and Society studies. My period of interest was selected because one of the most striking collapses of the ancient world took place in the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC. The Hittite empire and Aegean palatial world collapsed, Levantine and Cypriot polities were destroyed or abandoned, and New Kingdom Egypt went into decline. Globalized political and economic networks that had supported thriving large-scale societies disintegrated. Over the course of a few decades, even though people and their “grand traditions” or macrocultures survived, the structural conditions of societies—the beliefs and routines that characterized a culture—were fundamentally transformed as states and empires collapsed. Cline (2021) uses this tapestry to good effect, emphasizing the risks of invoking global influencing factors, such as climate change, to explain crises in any given society and arguing we need to view each society in the context of their mutually supporting interaction networks. Although speaking of the eastern Mediterranean, his argument is salient for Europe also.\n\nRapid climate change (RCC) events can transform ecosystems over the course of a few centuries, occasionally with turning points identified within a scale of decades. In Europe, a RCC can be identified around 1550–550 BC, with 1250–1150 BC a key turning point (Rohling et al. 2019, p. 38). Prior to anthropogenic impacts today, the earth’s climate naturally vacillated between warmer or colder and wetter or drier. In long-term perspective, the Holocene has been quite stable, and so the parameters within which variability can be recognized are comparatively narrow. Nonetheless, as we are witnessing at a global scale today, shifts that appear minor in annually or decadally resolved climate records can bring with them extreme weather events and challenges that are all the more impactful in finely balanced ecosystems.\n\nExceptional climate change horizons have been noted for later prehistory around 8.2, 4.2 and 3.2 ka. While proxy climate data from the eastern Mediterranean clearly identify this latter horizon, the date for its onset, its duration, and variation in its spatial and temporal intensity and impact are debated (Knapp and Manning 2016). Focused on the eastern Mediterranean, Kaniewski et al. (2019, 2020) also include markers for the 3.2 ka event in Greenland ice cores, indicating that there is value in expanding the spatial and social parameters used to explore this turning point to areas between there and the Mediterranean.\n\nWhen past climate change has been related to social change, it is not uncommon to find apocalyptic scenarios whereby a sudden and rapid change in climate led to extreme aridity, causing drought that devastated agricultural productivity, triggering famine that ultimately caused social unrest, thereby collapsing economic, political, and subsistence systems (Gill 2001; Diamond 2005; Kaniewski et al. 2015; Weiss and Bradley 2001). To work, the above formula requires change to have had a rapid onset and to be widespread, extreme, sustained, and consistent for multiple consecutive years. Climatic data are the core focus in such a model and correlation with archaeological research is commonly superficial and lacking in chronologically sensitive proxies for changes impacting on local communities, for example, using geoarchaeology or archaeobotany (Manning et al. 2020). Social science research informs us that few if any past societies were intrinsically inflexible or unresponsive to environmental change (Butzer 2012). Therefore, it is difficult to articulate visions of entire societies being overwhelmed by climate change, particularly when this places communities at the mercy of structuring conditions without scope for exercising human agency (Arponen et al. 2019; Johnson 2017; Kintigh and Ingram 2018; Knapp and Manning 2016; Middleton 2017a).\n\nThis said, we must not throw the climate-change baby out with a “determinist” bathwater. It has recently been argued that late 20th century post-processualism in its ambition to build from local conditions of life also sought to reduce the focus on external drivers of cultural transformation, with the aim of better accommodating human agency (Burke et al. 2021, pp. 2–3). In so doing, broader structuring conditions that affect choice in any specific society risk being incompletely accommodated. Our challenge is to avoid the causality trap while not disentangling societies and their environments (Arponen et al. 2019, p. 2). The question is not if climate and social change are linked, but how we can objectively deal with them as coupled systems, each of which includes a tapestry of variables that will not all neatly align (Butzer 2012, p. 3633). A truly comparative approach, therefore, cannot simply juxtapose select data from climatology onto archaeology to identify causes for past social change. Ultimately our challenge is to qualitatively explain the manner and extent to which climate change influenced human choices, beliefs, and practices.\n\nIn our current “information age” set within the Anthropocene, we are cognizant of the interplay between natural and anthropogenic global warming and the effects of extreme weather that are set to evolve into a global crisis, if unchecked, during the next century (Lane 2015). Despite having this historically exceptional knowledge of probable future conditions at our fingertips, belief and political buy-in are highly varied. A lesson from our own time may be that even with 20–20 foresight of catastrophic climate change incrementally affecting societies, short-term well-being is often in tension with long-term sustainability. When projected into the past, this incremental unfolding of change against a complex backdrop of competing priorities spanning generations is probably more reasonable than apocalyptic scenarios tied to short-term decision making. Ultimately, how past people responded to the pressures of climate change within their geographic, cultural, and historical context informs us about their understanding of their environment (Lane 2015; Manning et al. 2020, pp. 1, 38; Middleton 2018, p. 109). Consequently, simple models of ancient societies being overwhelmed by nature are of little benefit for understanding sustainability in long-term perspective—and this latter viewpoint even has potential to impact policy making today (Haldon et al. 2020, pp. 32–33).\n\nClimate Proxies\n\nTo understand past climates, different proxy data are used to develop models of specific aspects of climatic conditions and how these change over time. That is, we do not reconstruct past climatic conditions in their entirety but rather develop “estimates based on distinct statistical interpretations of available sources that may differ from each other and have important and substantial uncertainties on spatiotemporal scales” (Degroot et al. 2021, p. 540; see also Burke et al. 2021, pp. 4–5).\n\nPaleoclimate data are obtained from incrementally laid down, or stratified, deposits of very diverse materials. Each approach has in common the isolation of strata that can be dated, thereby allowing climatic proxy data to be incrementally extracted and measured. Sources include cave speleothems (stalagmites, stalactites, flowstones), sediment cores from lakes, bog accumulations, and tree rings. While ice cores are spatially beyond this review, they do provide a well-resolved geochronological control for other proxy data at a large spatial scale. Due to the broad geographic scale of this study, I collated and reviewed the results/conclusions of paleoclimatic and environmental studies that have used a range of different proxies. This is conducted at a necessarily superficial level without detailed evaluation of uncertainties in the results. In light of this, studies with closely constrained age-depth models and tight time increments were prioritized, and observations presented herein take account of the resolution of each study. Where lower-resolution datasets are included, limitations are stated in the text.\n\nThe regional picture is constructed from multiple local-scale studies; consequently, there is rarely a uniform and clear pattern to this bigger picture, and there are occasionally partly conflicting signatures even from neighboring datasets. Nonetheless, an aggregate picture is apparent across most datasets for each area; whatever the nature of changes inferred, they occurred at an exceptional level in a horizon beginning between 1250 and 1150 BC and lasting at least into the 11th century.\n\nStudy Areas\n\nParallel study of contemporary past societies allows us to view society as a framework within which climate change may be evaluated but also to view a single horizon of climate change as a structure within which different societies can be evaluated. This allows the potential impact of climate change on societies to be more clearly exposed at a regional scale. Europe is ideal for such a comparative study because it ranges between subtropical Mediterranean and Polar tundra climates; it is subject to Arctic, Siberian, Atlantic, and Mediterranean weather influences; and it has myriad topographies and distinct ecosystems. In addition, of the reputed 8.2, 4.2, and 3.2 ka climate events, the resolution of archaeological relative chronology is highest for the 3.2 ka horizon, and there is also a high density of absolute 14C dates (Fig. 1). Through excavation and survey, there is also a greater number of known sites in most study areas in this timeframe.\n\nThe selection of study areas was based on archaeological criteria to provide a European perspective on human–climate relations rather than being predicated on availability of paleoclimatic datasets. This helps avoid a “streetlight” effect of picking areas with (apparently) the most suitable data (Degroot et al., 2021, p. 540). Societies chosen are samples of each of the general “blocks” of social traditions/regions in Europe—the Atlantic, Nordic, Urnfield, Carpathian-Balkan, and Aegean zones (Fig. 2). The societies explored in detail vary in many regards and include politically hierarchical urban systems (the Aegean), densely settled landscapes dominated by monumental settlements and modest hierarchies (Po Valley and Pannonian Plain), multifamily long houses ranging from isolated to very densely distributed in a society with marked hierarchies (Nordic area), and finally, isolated, probably nuclear-family households with rare nucleated settlements or central places, with low visibility of social hierarchies (Ireland and Britain).\n\nEven theoretically accepting a large-scale 3.2 ka climate event, this should have varied impacts in these areas based on prevailing weather systems, geographic location, economic networking, and internal social organization. This also has the potential for “bad” climate change in one area to equate with “good” climate change in another, when viewed through a social lens. Archaeological research has defined substantial cultural changes in each study area between 1200 and 1100 BC (Supplemental Fig. 1). I argue that while climate change constantly shaped human–landscape relationships in prehistory, the 12th century drift was unusually sharp and was a driver of exceptional social changes at a spatial scale not seen before in Europe. Some societies were more directly impacted than others, but the aggregate impact on local and regional networks conveying globalizing influences was substantial enough to mark the 12th century as a key turning point in European prehistory.\n\nA recurrent issue is that climate change is notoriously difficult to pin down to narrow chronological parameters that can articulate with the resolution of archaeological chronologies and defined horizons of social change (Manning et al. 2020; Middleton 2017b; Swindles et al. 2013). This places a burden on archaeology at least to provide well-resolved spatial and temporal data in sufficient quantity to model the temporality and pace of change in societies. Fortunately, the late second millennium is a highly relevant window because we have (1) several areas with robust absolute and/or relative chronologies, (2) diverse social entities in which changes in complexity, land use, and population have been defined, (3) many different geographic and environmental zones with comparable datasets, (4) varied farming and land-use regimes seen in faunal, macrobotanical, and palynological datasets, and (5) a proposed horizon of crisis-driven social change around 1200 BC that affected trans-European networks (Cardarelli 2009; Kristiansen 2018; Kristiansen and Suchowska-Ducke 2015; Middleton 2020b; Molloy et al. 2020; Vandkilde 2016, pp. 116–117).\n\nThe Nature of the Evidence\n\nIn broad terms, the blocks of time we have to measure social transformations in Europe in the later second millennium BC range between 20 and 100 years. In an ideal world, we would reconstruct weather patterns on a multiseasonal/annual basis, but with the resolution of dating methods and the stratigraphic resolution available, we are more commonly considering decadal-scale increments when we integrate multiple distinct proxies (Finné et al. 2019; Swindles et al. 2013). In archaeological language, paleoclimate proxies are generally locked into longue durée perspectives on past processes of change, and only rarely have resolution to address the viewpoint of event history or histoire événementielle (Braudel 1972). Considering spatial scales, in pre- and protohistoric research there also is a greater tendency to focus on society-specific cases, which bracket geographic extents to relatively specific niches, with comparative regional studies notably rarer. This has the advantage of accommodating uncertainties in paleoclimate data in nuanced discussion, and the disadvantage of privileging particular societal systems in particular organizational states relative to their spatial and historical contexts.\n\nHaldon et al. (2020) emphasized the need to consider change as relative to the lived conditions of those experiencing it, which requires a multigenerational scale. Barrett (1998) similarly argued that our bird's eye view of prehistory affords a view of before, during, and after conditions of societal change, which is in turn set within a spatial context that accommodates neighboring sociopolitical entities. This has both the advantage and disadvantage of enabling us to view societies in a manner they themselves did not. In the areas examined in this paper, change took place over the course of a century, punctuated by events; my aim is to look at several lifetimes of shifting human–climate–landscape relationships in comparative regional perspective.\n\nWhile some climate proxies have more tightly constrained chronologies, temporal resolution is limited by the lowest resolved record included as well as the archaeological chronologies that are considered in parallel. This means any “events” we recognize can rarely be pinned down with great precision in calendar years. I am also cautious not to use event horizons themselves as a tool to correlate different datasets independent of reliable chronologies, because regionally specific conditions may unfold differently over decades or more (Swindles et al. 2013). At the same time, we should resist blurring the often precise and well-punctuated archaeological timelines to “fit” with sometimes less precise paleoclimate data (Haldon et al. 2020).\n\nApart from annual trends of climate change, extreme weather events today are highly impactful, from floods to droughts. Over the course of days to months, extreme events can have devastating effects. This emphasizes the need to view paleoclimatic data cautiously; in most cases they present averages of conditions across several years and can have seasonal biases. For example, chironomid-inferred temperatures relate to summer months, tree rings relate to spring and summer growth seasons, and many speleothems from continental Europe are probably biased toward wintertime hydroclimate. Geoarchaeological studies that can capture short-term and highly localized impacts of weather conditions are rare but, for example, reveal sluggish rivers in parts of the Pannonian Plain or brief arid summer phases in the Po Valley in the 12th century BC (Cremaschi et al. 2006; French 2010). The crucial issue is that the majority of paleoclimatic and environmental data can only present general trends and rarely the highly disruptive, even catastrophic, weather events whose signature would be, broadly speaking, bundled together with different signatures within the temporal steps our proxies reveal.\n\nBy far the most chronologically precise proxy is oak growth rings, where annually resolved increments have been identified. Unfortunately, using current methods, what each ring in isolation can tell us about climate conditions is limited, and their use as climatic records is much debated. Another proxy that may have high-resolution chronological increments is speleothems. These occur in most parts of the world where karst geology exists. Water seeping into caves lays down stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones in increments that can be distinguished, dated, and analyzed for climatic signatures. However, their development is impacted by a range of factors that shape their formation and secondary modification, as well as the relative seasonal contribution to the isotopic values that reveal hydroclimatic and/or temperature conditions (Fairchild and Baker 2012). This is relevant because “each proxy depends on its original local context, the interpretation of the hydro-climatic conditions … does not necessarily reflect just wet or dry climate” (Palmisano et al. 2021, p. 390).\n\nBog records depend on waterlogging and so occur typically in northern and western parts of Europe, though examples are found throughout the entire region. They provide a range of quantitative and semiquantitative markers for hydroclimate, commonly using a combination of testate amoebae, humification, and plant macrofossil analyses (Swindles et al. 2013, p. 308). They have the advantage of being sequentially laid down in layers that can be 14C dated directly, but ruptures called bog bursts, for example, and the equivocal nature of proxy data impact their reliability (Gearey et al. 2020).\n\nAnalysis of pollens reveals the range of wild and cultivated plants in the capture area surrounding a sample site, which in turn provides direct evidence for the relative extent of anthropogenic activity as well as how species taxa reflect prevailing environmental conditions in chronological sequence. As dating is usually dependent on a small number of 14C dates from detritus unintentionally deposited, age-depth models can be of variable precision, and so analytic increments consist of blocks the dating of which may not be more tightly constrained than several centuries. There is also an issue that pollen dispersal can overemphasize the presence of certain species, notably trees, and the preferential preservation in waterlogged areas biases analyses toward specific landscapes, which can underestimate degrees of openness of landscapes visible in grass or cereal versus arboreal pollen (e.g., Fyfe et al. 2013, fig. 1). Other proxy data are used here, each of which have limitations and inconsistencies relative to other datasets in terms of the timing and nature of conditions (hydroclimate and/or temperature).\n\nWe are also dealing with local climatic conditions across Europe that were shaped, to varying extents, by Atlantic, Arctic, Siberian, and Mediterranean weather systems. Each of these impacts the other such that changes in one region may influence unequal changes in another (Perşoiu et al. 2017). For example, Luterbacher et al.’s (2010) study of historic patterns and more recent work by Rohling et al. (2019, pp. 39, 50) demonstrate how increasingly cold and wet winters in the Aegean can be closely related to Atlantic conditions. Also increased aridity in areas dominated by Mediterranean weather systems can co-occur with increased rainfall in areas dominated by Atlantic systems in historic records (Turney et al. 2016, p. 77). As Carpenter noted in one of the earliest studies of climate–human relationships in prehistory, with the varied bodies of water, mountains, and open landscapes in Europe, the manifestations of climate change and their impact even at a local scale may be highly varied, never mind at the larger scale of this study (Carpenter 1966, pp. 63–70).\n\nThe Nature of Change Attested in Paleoclimate Proxies\n\nWith the above caveats in mind, before reviewing the available evidence, I set out general trends that are evident in many of the local proxies for each region. There are minor exceptions and contrary markers in some of these, and so the patterns presented are in broad strokes. The data from the south of Greece indicate that during the 12th century, that is after the collapse of palatial administrations had occurred, increasingly cooler and arid conditions set in for several centuries. The highly resolved Mavri Trypa cave hints that a brief arid peak occurred prior to the palatial collapse ca. 1200 BC, but aridity gradually increased in south Greece and across the eastern Mediterranean after 1200 BC. In the Carpathian Basin, there are consistent indicators of increased aridity after ca. 1250 BC, but potentially regionally differentiated temperature changes with signatures for increasing and decreasing temperatures are documented in speleothem and pollen records, respectively. Data from mountain caves and glaciers surrounding the Po Valley consistently indicate a climate shift in the 12th century, almost all indicating drier conditions, with some speleothem records suggesting warming conditions to the north of the Po Valley while others may indicate cooling to the east. While the temperature data are somewhat equivocal, the aridity markers accord with geoarchaeological data from settlements and lake cores in the Po Valley itself. Alongside palynological evidence for deforestation, geoarchaeological data from certain sites in the Po Valley indicate anthropogenically induced soil exhaustion.\n\nSimilar and contemporary markers are observed in parts of the Nordic world for both deforestation and soil exhaustion, suggesting a major anthropogenic impact on those landscapes studied in detail. In the Nordic area, the 12th century stands out as a less pronounced turning point in the climate proxies, and warmer conditions are defined in most of the relevant proxies. While there is conflicting information about hydroclimate, there is nothing to indicate an extreme shift in either direction. The picture in Ireland and Britain emerges from a variety of different types of proxy from different parts of the two islands, and while this inevitably leads to variability in the results, the general picture is one of a comparatively drier period in the 12th–10th centuries BC, with warmer conditions for at least the earlier part of this time block.\n\nIn parts of the Aegean, Po Valley, and Scandinavia, palynological evidence indicates reduced anthropogenic activity in the 12th century BC. Although very fragmentary, the data from the Pannonian Plain are at least consistent with this reduced-activity signature for areas with published records. In Britain and Ireland, some records indicate local-scale tree-clearance activities between 1200 and 1000 BC, but there is no marked shift in arboreal and anthropogenic pollen markers across larger areas of land.\n\nI begin each section below with a general overview of the landscape and the food production traditions. The dominant focus of studies in human–climate relations has been on settlement patterns, yet it is obvious that one of the more precarious aspects of social stability relative to environmental conditions must have been agriculture. A dearth of studies and linked-up methodological approaches within, never mind between, the study areas limits what can be said. The general picture shows continuity of the range of crops produced in each area in the later second millennium into the first millennium BC, though the relative abundance of species in diachronic and regional perspective remains unclear. The picture for animal management is slightly more substantial, particularly in recent studies by Dibble and Finné (2021) and Trentacoste et al. (2018). These papers demonstrate the importance of defining changes in arable and pastoral practices for understanding sustainability or resilience within, and broader societal responses to, periods of known climate change. A key issue is not what was produced but where, by, and for whom, and what levels of surplus were created. Although we measure patterns of change in faunal, macrobotanical, and palynological datasets, this is only one element in the story. There is a clear need to build larger datasets for comparative regional-scale analyses of the social turning point identified in the later Bronze Age.\n\nMycenaean Greece\n\nThe landscapes surrounding the Bronze Age urban centers in the Aegean region were dominated by rocky and mountainous terrain interspersed with pockets of fertile plains, with variation over very short distances (Weiberg et al. 2016, p. 41). Watercourses were present but relatively rare and small. Agriculture was dominantly rain fed rather than dependent on terrestrial water management or irrigation. Macrobotanical, pollen, and written evidence indicate that a diverse range of crops were cultivated, including but not dominated by the Mediterranean triad of wheat, olives, and grapes (Livarda 2014; Margaritis et al. 2014; Vetters et al. 2016; Weiberg et al. 2019). Pastoral agriculture was dominated by sheep, goat, pigs, and cattle. In many contexts, sheep were dominant, apart from Tiryns (cattle), Lerna, and Athens (pig), where they are the second-most consumed taxa (Dibble and Finné 2021, fig. 2). In the later Late Bronze Age, the consumption of sheep for meat increased substantially and perhaps dominated, but this is closely related to maintaining flocks for wool production. Large flocks were managed by palace authorities for wool (primarily), according to Linear B documents, as well as for meat (Halstead 2003). The frequent consumption of sheep extended to non-palatial communities. In the Early Iron Age, perhaps as a response to increased aridity, goat husbandry increased proportionally in some parts of Greece, which may reflect the drought tolerance of this species (Dibble and Finné 2021, p. 57).\n\nThere are clear indications of climate change around the turn of the 12th century in Greece. Speleothems indicate wetter conditions had begun early in the 19th century and lasted until ca. 1150 BC, after which more arid and cooler conditions developed, peaking around 1050 BC. This same cooling pattern is found in datasets from northern Greece and in marine cores in the eastern Mediterranean. Although the evidence is limited, with poor chronological control, Crete may deviate from this pattern by remaining relatively unchanged or even warmer.\n\nThe Mavri Trypa cave speleothem (Fig. 3) is resolved to ± 31.5 years and ~5-year resolution, which provides a closely constrained dataset for hydroclimate in the 13th to 11th centuries (Finné et al. 2017). Another partially published speleothem from Alepotrypa cave on the Mani Peninsula in the south Peloponnese provides corroborating data for aridity peaks, though a switch to wetter conditions may have occurred between the 12th and 11th centuries (Boyd 2015; Finné et al. 2017, p. 8; Weiberg et al. 2016, pp. 46–47). A sediment core from Asea Valley, inland about 85 km northeast of Mavri Trypa cave, suggests cooler and wetter conditions from ca. 1350 BC until 750 BC, though the chronology is less closely constrained (Unkel et al. 2014). Halfway between these two loci, a core from central Messenia at Agios Floros mirrors more closely the Mavri Trypa data, with a wetter and cooler period that gave way to a more arid phase broadly by ca. 1150 BC (Norström et al. 2018). The core from Gialova lagoon on the southwest coast of Messenia, though least well-constrained chronologically, shows dry conditions throughout the Mycenaean era until the late 11th century (Katrantsiotis et al. 2018). A core with a moderately well-constrained age-depth model from Lake Lerna in the Argolid indicates a relatively wet Late Bronze Age, with a warm/dry peak for summer temperatures modeled for ca. 1250 BC before a return to cooler summers (Katrantsiotis et al. 2019, fig. 8). In the north Aegean, the speleothem from Skala Marion cave from the island of Thasos reveals a wetter horizon 1350 to 750 BC, but with a slight drift toward (relatively) more arid conditions 1250 to 1150 BC (Psomiadis et al. 2018, fig. 6). The age-depth model is least well-constrained for this phase (Psomiadis et al. 2018, fig. 3a). Notably in records showing substantial change, this was in the 12th century (i.e., after the palaces were abandoned) and not in advance of it (Norström et al. 2018, p. 572).\n\nMarine cores from the eastern Mediterranean indicate that average sea-surface temperatures dropped by as much as 2 to 3 degrees around 1150–950 BC, and a substantial change in temperature would be required to cool this massive body of water (Drake 2012; Rohling et al. 2019, p. 39). Rohling et al. (2019) associate this sea-surface cooling with an increased frequency of northerly cold air outbreaks in the Mediterranean, which correlate with cooling periods detected in Greenland ice cores (see also Katrantsiotis et al. 2019, p. 47; Klus et al. 2018; Kobashi et al. 2011). Taking account of speleothem and sediment cores from the lands bordering the eastern Mediterranean, Rohling et al. (2019) argue these cold streams were channeled through north–south valleys such as the Morava-Vardar-Axios and Struma Valleys. This may have impacted the regionally distinct hydroclimate data from Skala Marion cave, which lies in this path.\n\nA spread of pine and increase in herb vegetation is seen in some parts of southern Greece with palynological records dated to the 12th to 10th centuries, indicating a reduction in the extent of anthropogenic exploitation of previously prosperous landscapes, notably in Attica (Kouli 2012, pp. 274–275; Kouli et al. 2009). Conversely, a core from the Kotihi lagoon in the northwest Peloponnese does not indicate any sharp changes in landscape management anywhere near the 1200 BC horizon, although this has low chronological resolution (Lazarova et al. 2012). In Crete, the later 14th and 13th centuries are argued to have been cooler than preceding ones, followed by a warmer and more arid 12th century, though low chronological resolution is again an issue (Rohling et al. 2002; Triantaphyllou et al. 2009). In northwest Crete, more closely resolved cores present pollen signatures that do not suggest any substantial changes in that locale ca. 1200 BC (Bottema and Sarpaki 2016).\n\nThe repeated correspondence in independently well-dated proxies indicates that the pattern of increasing aridity and falling temperatures is real for many parts of Greece and not a product of using phenomena themselves to correlate datasets (Knapp and Manning 2016; Swindles et al. 2013). Most proxies indicate increasingly arid conditions beginning between 1200 and 1150 BC, though some suggest a somewhat countervailing or stable trend. While local conditions no doubt influence this, a key unifying factor for many proxies is a horizon of change in the 12th century. This is coupled with indications of reduced anthropogenic signatures in the pollen records or a shift in the focus of activity to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nThe Pannonian Plain\n\nThe Carpathian Basin is located directly north of Greece between central and southeast Europe and has notably different topography and weather patterns, with heavy rains more common throughout the year, including during the hot summers. It is characterized by its bowl shape, surrounded by mountains with a flat interior, the Pannonian Plain. This plain is drained by many rivers, ranging from small to exceptionally large in width/volume, including the Danube and Tisza Rivers. Dietary habits were somewhat different than in Greece, though relevant studies are few and commonly site specific in scale. Data on arable agriculture suggest a dominance of grain crops with nut-bearing trees also commonly exploited (Filipović et al. 2020; Gumnior et al. 2020). Broomcorn millet was introduced to the Carpathian Basin in the later Bronze Age, indicating a shift in the (potential) intensity of arable farming. This contributed to temporal diversification in risk management due to a potential spring harvest of millet complementing a diverse autumnal harvest, a pattern also seen in the Po Valley (Filipović et al. 2020).\n\nThere are indications of a nominal change in animal husbandry between the Middle and Late Bronze Age, and meat consumption appears prevalent in diets with sheep/goat usually dominant followed by cow, pig, horse, and perhaps dog, all being consumed alongside hunted game. This latter comprised in excess of 10% of NISP at investigated sites, suggesting it was a substantial component in dietary traditions (Molloy et al. 2020; Nicodemus 2014; Szeverenyi et al. 2015). For most sites of the early Iron Age (ca. 1050/1000 BC) in the southern Pannonian Plain where data are available, the importance of sheep/goat dropped to 10–15% while cattle was commonly 35–45%. Pig was usually second-most popular at around 20–30%, and horse ranged from either very rare up to 15%. Hunted game dropped significantly in frequency, rarely exceeding 5% of NSIP (Blažić 2010; Medović 1988). This suggests that good pasture remained plentiful, but people may not have ranged as far from their settlements, despite a swing to increasingly arid conditions seen in the paleoclimate record. A pattern of increasing aridity centered on 1200 BC suggests some common trends for the Pannonian Plain and the Aegean. However, there is a less consistent picture in paleoclimate proxies for temperature change in the Pannonian Plain.\n\nA study from the area around Lake Balaton uses multiproxy analysis of Unio bi-valve shells and animal bone from archaeological strata and compares these with a tightly resolved speleothem from Trió cave (1–30-year increments and with an age resolution of 30–100 years) ca. 80 km to the south (Demény et al. 2019). These data show that between 1600–1250 BC there was higher winter precipitation. For the 16th and 15th centuries, the trend suggests cooler temperatures relative to the earlier centuries of the millennium before increasing aridity and temperatures from the 14th century (Demény et al. 2019, p. 91, fig. 8). This led to a dry/warm spike around 1250 BC. Following an initial slight drop in modeled temperatures toward the end of the 13th century, this study models higher temperatures than were typical for the LBA I and II ceramic phases (see below) in the 12th and 11th centuries BC (Demény et al. 2019, p. 92). This modeled increase in temperature contrasts with other datasets in the wider area. The Trió cave data primarily refer to wintertime hydroclimate, and it is important to note that in many ecosystems, winter is the opportunity for soils to recharge, particularly when they are paired with comparatively dry summers (Degroot et al. 2021, p. 544; Demény et al. 2019, pp. 90–91).\n\nDemény et al.’s hydroclimate model finds general support in other records from the Carpathian region with less well-constrained chronologies. These include Ascunsă, Poleva, and Ursilor cave speleothems, the ice core from Scărişoara cave, a sediment core from Lake Brazi, and a bog near Fenyves-tető in Transylvania. Together these also indicate the onset of a cool and wet horizon after 1600 BC, which was followed by increasingly arid conditions beginning between 1250 and 1150 BC (Drăguşin et al. 2014; Magyari et al. 2013; Perşoiu et al. 2017; Schnitchen et al. 2006). In their study of speleothems from the highlands immediately east of the Pannonian Plain in Romania, Drăguşin et al. (2014, p. 1375) argue that during “the 3.2 ka event, both temperature and rainfall seasonality appear to have changed in southern Romania.” While they find it less clear as to whether these data primarily reflect local winter or summer conditions, the increasing δ18O levels would be consistent with the kind of aridity spike modeled for the Trió record as well as speleothem records in neighboring regions. It is possible the Poleva record shows a swing to wetter conditions ca. 3.2 ka before a swing back to drier conditions around 3.0 ka. However, given its low chronological resolution, Drăguşin et al. (2014, p. 1374) suggest these two turning points could be shifted back to better match other neighboring datasets. In a review of all Holocene speleothem data for east-central and southeast Europe, Kern et al. (2019, p. 19) observe that the only systematic δ13C or δ18O shifts or drifts observed across multiple records at this spatial scale for the Holocene occurred between 4 and 3 ka, and they propose 3.5 ka (ca. 1550 BC or the beginning of the Late Bronze Age) as a focal point worth exploring further.\n\nSediment cores from Lake Ighiel have a well-resolved chronology and show “highly fluctuating values increasing between” 2250 and 1350 BC, with a marked wet horizon toward the end of that sequence, followed by a drier phase (Haliuc et al. 2017, p. 104). An exceptional dry spell is documented between (broadly) 1440 and 1070 BC at the nearby bog in Fenyves-tetȍ inside the Carpathian arc in northern Romania (Schnitchen et al. 2006). Allowing for chronological uncertainties, these data broadly support the wetter earlier centuries of the LBA followed by a 14th century BC turning point, to the 13th century BC aridity peak, and continued aridity into the 11th BC century modeled by Demény et al (2019). In the Benta Valley geoarchaeological survey, French (2010, pp. 47–48) recorded a slowing and silting up of rivers in the 12th century BC, which encouraged peat formation. He argued this was caused by deforestation and soil erosion due to an increasing emphasis on arable over pastoral agriculture, though changes to seasonal rainfall documented in climate proxies may also have contributed to such a phenomenon.\n\nThere are few published palynological sequences from the Late Bronze Age Pannonian Plain. In the eastern plain, a study around the settlement of Corneşti Iarcuri shows that arboreal pollen between 1600 and 1200 BC represents diverse species and ranges from 38–46% from strata within the settlement to 60–65% in lake sediments 7 km away (Gumnior et al. 2020, p. 184). Pollen from the settlement demonstrates that between 1200 and 1000 BC there was reduced anthropogenic activity in its environs, which is consistent with 14C data modeling of activity within the settlement (Gumnior et al. 2020, p. 184; Lehmpuhl et al. 2019). From the Gutaiului Mountains in the northwest hinterland of the plain, pollen signatures suggest cooling conditions and increased precipitation after 1200 BC (Feurdean et al. 2008, p. 500). While perhaps representative of specific conditions where a vast plain meets mountains, these data demonstrate some heterogeneity in rainfall markers for the region. The suggested declining temperatures in Feurdean et al.’s study contrasts with data from the Trió cave study. Around 180 km west of this core, the Sarló Hát pollen record reveals relatively unpronounced change prior to 1000 BC, after which woodland was actively reduced and open steppe environments began to dominate (Magyari et al. 2010, p. 926).\n\nThe Po Valley\n\nSocieties in the Po Valley in the north of Italy were closely linked to those of the Pannonian Plain, both in terms of cultural practices but also managing a relatively flat riverine landscape with many wetland areas (Molloy et al. in press). The Po Valley is a wedge surrounded by mountains to the north and south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. It has a very flat interior, with low ridges separating many small to large watercourses, most feeding into the Po River before it joins the Adriatic.\n\nA diverse arable agricultural system is in evidence in the macrobotanical record, including remains from excavated sites that demonstrate an increasing exploitation of millet at Terramare settlements (Tafuri et al. 2018). There is general continuity of species that were exploited after 1200 BC, but with a potential relative increase in consumption of legumes (Trentacoste et al. 2018, p. 5). The range of fauna consumed appears broadly similar to that of the Pannonian Plain, as does a focus on meat and secondary product consumption (Cremaschi et al. 2006; 2018; Mazzorini and Ruggini 2009; Mercuri et al. 2006). Trentacoste et al. (2018) provide the most detailed study of animal husbandry and management for any of the study regions. They show that there is heterogeneity within the Po Valley and immediate hinterlands, with distinct differences north and south of the river. In the north, in the centuries before 1200 BC, cattle gradually replaced sheep/goat as the dominant species, and pig gradually gained in importance to more or less match sheep/goat during the Iron Age, a time when the prevalence of cattle increased. The fortunes of sheep/goat are similar in the north-east plain (Veneto), but the relative prevalence of cattle and pig are reversed. South of the river, although data are more limited, sheep/goat dominated throughout the Bronze Age while cattle prevalence remained relatively low. There was a collapse in the relative importance of sheep/goat in the Iron Age, when pig came to dominate and the prevalence of cattle increased slightly, particularly in southernmost extent of the plain (Romagna). These data indicate some relevant shifts in animal husbandry in the wake of the collapse of the Terramare system.\n\nThere are suggestions that manuring and rotating arable and pastoral land use were elements of intensified agricultural production, though extensification is also evidenced through tree clearance between 1400 and 1150 (Cremaschi et al. 2018; Dalla Longa et al. 2019, p. 8). Population growth after 1500 BC may well “have been triggered by the introduction of new technologies such as the plough, crop rotation, stabling and the switch from fire–fallow cultivation to irrigated crops” (Palmisano et al. 2021, p. 411).\n\nVirtually all climate proxies from within and around the Po Valley indicate increased aridity from the 12th century. The speleothems from Corchia and Renella caves are resolved to ca. 11–16 years. The caves are near the west coast of north-central Italy, broadly within 150 km of the Po Valley. Data from both speleothems indicate that the climate gradually became more arid after 1600 BC. After a phase of variable conditions visible more at Renella than at Corchia, these datasets indicate an aridity peak between 1200 and 1100 BC (Regattieri et al. 2014, p. 390, fig. 10; Zanchetta et al. 2016, fig. 8). In the Alps immediately west of the Po Valley, Rio Martino cave is located ca. 1200 m above the Po Valley. Multiproxy analysis of speleothems there indicate a dry period 1600–1200 BC, before a very brief swing toward wetter conditions around 1200 BC, followed by a shift to increasingly arid conditions extending well into the first millennium BC (Regattieri et al. 2019, fig. 4). The multiple speleothems from the COMNISPA I and II projects from Spannagel cave in the Austrian Alps to the northeast indicate a shift toward drier and colder winter conditions in that locale in the 16th–13th centuries BC, followed by a gradual increase in δ18O equated to warmer conditions following a cold peak ca. 1200 BC (Demény et al. 2019, p. 90, fig. 8; Fohlmeister et al. 2012b, fig. 3; Scholz et al. 2012, fig. 7). In northeast Italy, the speleothem from Ernesto cave in the Alps north of the Po Valley to the east of Lake Garda indicate warmer conditions in the 16th–15th centuries BC, before cooling in the 14th and 13th centuries, followed by a sustained temperature increase from a cold peak ca. 1200 BC that ran into the beginning of the first millennium BC (Scholz et al. 2012, fig. 7). On the southeast fringe of the Alps at the head of the Adriatic part of the Mediterranean Sea, the δ18O data from Savi cave indicate a warm peak in the 13th century, followed by a fall in temperatures in the 12th century BC that was sustained into the first millennium BC (Frisia et al. 2005; Scholz et al. 2012, fig. 7).\n\nNorthwest of the Po Valley, palynological and detrital data from glaciers in the northwestern arc of the Alps at Great Aletsch (Switzerland) and Mer de Glace (France) suggest warmer Bronze Age conditions came to an end between 1200 and 1100 BC, followed by a colder phase with glacial advance (Le Roy et al. 2015, pp. 13, 17, fig. 7). Despite the disparity between the climate in mountain sampling locations and the low-lying plains where population was more concentrated, a turning point in the decades around 1200 BC is consistently evident.\n\nCloser to the Bronze Age settlement networks of the Po Valley, data from Lake Ledro indicates increased water levels from ca. 1600 BC, followed by lower levels indicative of increased aridity after ca. 1200 BC (Magny et al. 2009, pp. 585–586). Despite a low-resolution age-depth model for Lake Lucone beside Lake Garda, the data suggest that after ~1100 BC, there was substantial reduction in anthropogenic markers coupled with a reduction in lake level (Valsecchi et al. 2006, p. 110). These data also show that prior to 1200 BC, northern Italy had a humid living environment, reflecting a specific ecology.\n\nIn the eastern Po Plain, Fontana et al. (2017) argued that rising sea levels around 1200 BC contributed to the gradual abandonment of coastal settlements, emphasizing gradual rather than crisis-driven impacts on lifeways of coastal communities. Geoarchaeological data from settlements indicate a brief phase of decreased rainfall in the decades around 1200 BC (Cremaschi et al. 2006; 2018; Cupito et al. 2015). At the Terramare site of Poviglio Santa Rosa, this is recognized in stratified soil horizons within the absolute date range of 1330–1170 cal BC (Cremaschi et al. 2006, p. 92). This corresponds to a significant drop in the water table that affected the large water wells and interconnecting ditches at the site (Cremaschi et al. 2006, p. 96). This also impacted the accessibility of drinking water. A drier horizon is documented in sediment analysis dated between 1200 and 1150 BC at the Terramare sites of Montale, Casinalbo, and Fondo Paviani, though these cannot be considered extreme or lasting horizons of change. The drier period after 1200 BC correlates with a decline in cereal signatures documented in on-site pollen samples (Dal Corso et al. 2012; Dalla Longa et al. 2019; Mercuri et al. 2012, p. 366).\n\nCremaschi et al. (2006, fig. 6) illustrate the relative dearth of arboreal versus non-arboreal pollen signatures in the Po Valley in the second half of the second millennium compared with other regions in Italy. Mercuri et al. (2012, p. 362) compare data from marine core RF93-30 from the north Adriatic and the site of Terramare di Montale, showing incremental reduction in trees in the landscape over time. Cardarelli (2009, p. 456) recognizes this deforestation as a common feature from the time the Terramare sites were established. This contrasts substantially with the limited data for land management in the Pannonian Plain (above). Continued use of woodland includes managed, probably coppiced hardwood species along with cultivation of olive and sweet chestnut trees from ca. 1450 BC. This change is also associated with increased grass and related weed pollens in RF93-30 (Mercuri et al. 2012, fig. 4). Overall, the pattern seen in pollen and geoarchaeological datasets suggests increasingly common drought conditions in an already much deforested landscape after 1200 BC (Cupitò et al. 2012, pp. 56–57).\n\nThe Nordic Area\n\nIn the Nordic area, we may predict different conditions due to its more northerly location and greater exposure to Arctic and Atlantic influences. There are fewer and more conflicting climate proxies for this region, but in general terms the reduced precipitation seen in the southern areas may be in evidence while temperature markers suggest that this period became marginally warmer. The Nordic Bronze Age was characterized by maritime societies, with the densest activity on parts of Jutland and southern Sweden. In Jutland, the land is undulating and well drained with much of the region suited to arable and pastoral agriculture. Southern Sweden is notably hillier, and arable farmland is more fragmented and concentrated in the south and by the western coast (French 2010). The range of cultivars recognized in macrobotanical studies is more restricted than in Jutland, and it shows continuity with earlier periods (Vretemark 2010, pp. 161–162). Vretemark (2010, p. 160) notes that naked six-rowed barley was dominant in the wider region, and spelt and emmer were present. This may indicate low diversity in managing agricultural risks, though these practices may be related more generally to productivity levels in a specific climatic zone (McClatchie 2014). The species identified in pollen records also suggest increasing grassland and soil degradation into the 12th century (Søgaard et al. 2018, p. 219). Meat was perhaps a dominant food source, with cattle and sheep the most common and pigs exceptionally rare or absent, possibly due to their more diverse food requirements (Nyegaard 2018). Evidence for the consumption of game species is also rare, indicating a relatively restricted diet within homesteads and a marked deviation from diets in the southern areas.\n\nThere are no speleothems relevant to this period from the Nordic world, but studies from Bunker and Atta caves in western Germany are broadly relevant spatially (Fohlmeister et al. 2012a; Niggemann et al. 2003). The data from Bunker cave suggest a trend of increasing temperature and rainfall from the 15th century consistently into the early first millennium BC, though this trend is less pronounced in the record from nearby Atta cave (Fohlmeister et al. 2012a, fig. 5).\n\nStore Mosse, the “Great Bog,” near the coast in southwestern Sweden has been the subject of multiproxy climatic and environmental research that has a well-constrained age-depth model (Kylander et al. 2013). This shows dry conditions prior to 1500 BC after which warmer and wetter conditions set in, with increased wetness after 1200 (Kylander et al. 2013, p. 79, fig. 8). This, however, contrasts with the δ18O signature from Lake Igelsjön, ca. 130 km inland to the northeast, which shows a swing to drier conditions ca. 1200 BC, though the record is fragmentary (Hammarlund et al. 2003, fig. 9). Nearly 500 km to the north, cores from Lake Blektjärnen have a well-constrained age-depth model, and data show the coldest and wettest phase occurred ca. 1550 BC, after which there was warming and drying that increased slightly after 1200 BC (Andersson et al. 2010, fig. 7). The warmer conditions after 1500 BC are also attested through chironomid analysis from lacustrine cores taken in a ca. 500 km transect from six lakes across north-central Sweden to southwest Norway, which reveal a coolest point around 1350 BC before warming again (Velle et al. 2005, p. 1451, fig. 14). The hydroclimate picture is somewhat unclear for the Nordic area, with conflicting data potentially identifying local-scale trends. Notably, however, the trend appears to be toward warmer conditions.\n\nPollen records and geoarchaeological analyses reveal that deforestation, and in some areas soil exhaustion, took place in densely occupied parts of Nordic Europe between 1500 and 1100 BC. This represents localized but high-level anthropogenic impacts on the environment. The Thy region of northern Denmark has been subject to interdisciplinary analysis of social landscape development. Data from there indicate that tree cover was reduced by more than half down to 33% arboreal pollen, so that forested areas all but disappeared and open grassland expanded to over 54% of the record between 1500 and 1100 BC (Andersen 2018, pp. 225–230; French 2010, pp. 36–39; Søgaard et al. 2018, p. 218). A recent study using REVEALS modeling suggests that even this low level of tree cover in Thy is overestimated in pollen records so that levels should be read as being lower still (Kristiansen et al. 2020, fig. 2).\n\nThe reuse of old and driftwood timber for the house at Bjerre Ennge 6 has been taken to indicate the infrequency of high-quality wood in the area, as does the commonly attested use of lower-quality wood species (Betula, Salix, Populus, Alnus) and the collection of Quercus and Salix for fuel (Søgaard et al. 2018, p. 214). From Fyn Island between southern Sweden and Jutland, pronounced deforestation is attested in a core from Gudme Lake during and after the 12th century (Rasmussen and Olsen 2009). This increase in anthropogenic activity may suggest inward migration from increasingly marginal environments surrounding this area.\n\nFrench (2010, pp. 40, 42) documented significant soil degradation in Thy as well as in Bohuslän in Sweden, where there was an expansion of heathland-type vegetation. Also in southern Sweden, pollen from the Bjäre Peninsula shows development of an “opened cultural landscape” dominated by grasslands in the second millennium BC, with non-arboreal pollen increasing from a base of 60% to 90% of totals closer to settled areas (Nord 2009, p. 70). The picture in north-central and west Jutland is very similar and suggests landscapes tailored for a prevalence of pastoral over arable farming, perhaps also reflected in the low crop diversity seen in macrobotanical records. In southern Jutland, following a reduced signature for anthropogenic activities ca. 1200 BC, a strong signature returns in the pollen record ca. 1050 BC (Kneisel et al. 2019, p. 1611). Furthermore, an aggregate model of pollen data from south Jutland and north Germany reveals the century 1200–1100 BC as one of four distinct lulls in anthropogenic activity between 4500 and 500 BC (Feeser et al. 2019, p. 1598).\n\nAlthough the evidence is limited, it appears that human induced environmental changes in the period 1500–1100 BC rendered areas of previously productive farmland significantly less so in parts of Jutland and south Sweden during the 12th to 11th centuries BC. Anthropogenic impacts on the environment appear to be causal, and it is plausible that climate change also played a contributory role, and certainly interplay between the two should be considered. Overall, the centuries-old balance achieved in deforested landscapes in a relatively warm and wet climatic niche was tipped in several parts of this region after 1200 BC, followed by progressively lower levels of anthropogenic activity for at least a century.\n\nIreland and Britain\n\nLying in the Atlantic northwest of Europe, Ireland and Britain experienced climate and weather patterns heavily influenced by Atlantic systems even more than the Nordic area. They constitute the most environmentally diverse study area, ranging from the warmer, drier, and flatter region of southern Britain to the mountainous landscape of northern Scotland and the low-lying and wet interior of Ireland. Land suited to arable farming is highly variable but nonetheless present in most parts of the islands, and many substantial river courses connect the inland with the surrounding seas. Animal husbandry was extensively practiced, to the extent that it has been suggested that hillforts were constructed to protect animals because livestock were construed as a major manifestation of wealth and status (McClatchie 2014; O’Brien and O’Driscoll 2017). Cereal pollen and macrobotanical remains indicate low diversity, as with the Nordic area, and a strong reliance on naked six-row barley in Ireland and Britain (Bradley 2007, p. 192; McClatchie 2014, p. 35). In southern Britain, consumption of sheep and cattle for meat alternated in predominance in most communities; pig occasionally matched their proportions but more commonly was quite rare in assemblages, as was typical in the Nordic area. By the Iron Age, the consumption of pigs became exceptionally rare (Serjeantson 2007).\n\nIn Ireland, a significant increase in δ15N in the bones of wild and domestic herbivores indicates woodland clearance and increased pastoralism on a scale that altered the soil chemistry of wooded, unwooded “wild,” and agropastorally managed land during the Late Bronze Age (Guiry et al. 2018). This also reflects mixed farming in subsistence strategies, which accompanied intensified use of farmland. Guiry et al. (2018) also observe that these δ15N signatures come from the soils in which crops grew, thereby revealing a fundamental anthropogenic transformation of the wider environment by human actions from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age onward.\n\nProxies of climate change are comparatively rare and widely dispersed, but they are diverse, providing a uniquely valuable multiproxy perspective. There is only one speleothem record covering this period for both Ireland and Britain, and analyses focused on the early rather than the late Holocene. The speleothem comes from Crag cave in southwest Ireland and indicates a period of warming after 1200 BC (Charman 2010, fig. 5; McDermott et al. 2001). While the intervals are resolved to 7–18 years in this speleothem, a dearth of absolute dates from the Bronze Age means that “total uncertainties are greater than 1000 years between c. 2700–5000 cal. BP” and so it needs to be used with caution in this time frame (McDermott et al. 2001, p. 1330, fig. 2; Swindles et al. 2013, pp. 306, 317). The 12th century indicator of warming in this proxy is mainly recognized by correlating observed phenomena with other proxies from nearby (Swindles et al. 2013).\n\nAtlantic conditions also impact Greenland, where a warming 12th century and a cool spike in the 11th century BC were detected in ice core analyses (Kobashi et al. 2011, figs. 1, 3; see also Kaniewski et al. 2019). Klus et al.’s (2018, p. 1167) ice-core study documenting a 7000-year data transect of north Atlantic Holocene conditions revealed that one of two exceptional cold events occurred in the 11th century BC and lasted ca. 29 years. The bar for “normal conditions” in that study was set from 4000–3201 ka, emphasizing the deviation beginning in the later 13th century BC (3.2 ka).\n\nPeat bogs occur frequently in Britain and Ireland. Forming since the end of the last Ice Age, they have been the subject of many local-scale studies. I focus here on more recent synthetic analyses rather than individual studies. Strata have been dated using 14C dating, spheroidal carbonaceous particles, and tephra deposits, or a combination of these (Swindles et al. 2013, p. 305). According to Gearey et al. (2020), data from bogs indicate that mean summertime temperatures peaked 1310–1100 BC before falling ca. 1.5° between 1150 and 960 BC to ca. 12°, which was warmer than bracketing centuries. A model of increased mean summer temperatures and aridity in the 12th century BC followed by decreasing temperature but relatively lower rainfall is indicated in chironomid head research from Ireland, complementing the peat-bog records (Plunkett et al., 2020, fig. 6; Swindles et al. 2013, pp. 316, 317).\n\nA series of Irish bog oaks provide an annually resolved record. Focusing on variable prevalence and age of trees, Turney et al. (2016, p. 75) identify an abrupt downturn in oak numbers ca. 1180 BC as a consequence of “long-term forcing, consistent with a climate-driven shift rather than site specific factors skewing the record.” Furthermore, they identify a shift to wetter conditions after 992 BC. Despite the tight chronological resolution of the data source itself, Turney et al.’s modeling of tree ages as a marker of climatic shifts only partly articulates with the other proxies from Ireland cited above. A key issue is the occurrence of a climatic shift around 1180 BC in their study.\n\nLooking at tree-ring data from these same oak series, Baillie argues for a cold period between 1159 and 1141 BC (Baillie 2002). He also notes that this apparent cold spell is most visible in oaks that had grown in bog environments, and this reduced growth is less visible in (archaeologically recovered) oaks that grew on mineral soils (Baillie 2002, p. 380). It remains possible that climate conditions affected bog water levels and hence oak growth rates in that ecological niche, accounting for these 12th century restricted growth markers on oaks there and not from other contexts.\n\nData from bogs in Dartmoor, southern England, indicate a sustained wet phase between 1395 and 1150 cal BC (Amesbury et al. 2008, p. 91), while Barber et al. (2003, pp. 532–533) argue for climatic deterioration in England and Ireland ca. 1250–1200 BC when “even wetter conditions prevailed” before a late 12th–11th century BC upswing. Langdon et al.’s (2004) study of chironomid head capsules from Talkin Tarn lake sediments in northern England indicates increasing temperatures from 1200 BC. A brief wet horizon around 1100 BC has been recognized in various datasets from Ireland and Britain (Charman 2010, p. 1543; figs. 3d, 6d; Plunkett et al. 2020, fig. 6). A general pattern seen across multiple British datasets shows that a wet period between 1500 and 1200 BC gave way to a drier period from 1200 to 800 BC, potentially punctuated by a brief wet period in the 11th century (Brown 2008, p. 8, fig. 1; Charman et al. 2006; Gearey et al. 2020; Plunkett et al. 2020; Swindles et al. 2013, pp. 316–317). This wet to dry swing is evident in Charman et al.’s (2006) study of lake levels in Britain, and though a degree of regional variability is attested, this pattern also corresponds with Magny’s (2004) study of lake levels in central Europe. For Ireland and Britain, data are conflicting as to when and for how long a warmer trend emerged, but there is general agreement that the 12th and 11th centuries were warmer than preceding ones, though that trend may have begun in the 13th century in Ireland.\n\nFyfe et al. (2013) modeled more than 70 pollen records from Ireland and Britain using a REVEALS model, which did not show a significant change in land use around 1200 BC. Rather, it shows heterogeneity in land use across the different landscapes of the two islands. Drawn from more specific cases, the pollen record from Ireland suggests that tree clearance episodes occurred at a very localized level between 1400 and 1000 BC, often around enclosed sites such as Haughey’s Fort, Navan Fort, Mooghaun, and Ballylin (Plunkett 2007, p. 233, 2009). This localized pattern of intensified clearance and land use complements the argument for increased nitrogen content in soils (visible in animal bones) discussed above.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBased on the results of these diverse studies, there is no consistent and clear picture for Europe ca. 3.2 ka. Two trends appear to emerge that differentiate northwest and southeast, potentially related to the relative impact of Atlantic and Mediterranean systems. Although exceptions occur, many of the cited studies identify a warming 12th century BC trend in central and northern Europe and a countervailing trend of lowering temperatures for the Mediterranean ambit. Decreased rainfall is consistently identified across Europe, apart perhaps from the Nordic area, in the 12th century BC. The 11th century BC is more heterogeneous in terms of what the records tell us, but the consistent pattern is a deviation begins between the 13th and 12th century BC that lasts at least a century in each of the five areas examined above. The onset is staggered, but this may well be predicted given the chronological resolution of the records themselves and using absolute dates rather than observed phenomena to cross reference them.\n\nAs local environmental conditions occur at the interface between climate and social use of landscapes, this provides a context for specific cultural entities that occupied each area during this transitional period (Weiberg and Finné 2018, p. 591). In the Aegean, Pannonian Plain, Po Valley, and Nordic regions, the climate conditions in which extensive settlement patterns and specific landscape uses developed between 1500 and 1200 BC changed in the following centuries. The exploitation of good climate between 1500 and 1200 BC, perhaps more than the arrival of “bad climate” after 1200 BC, may have fomented problems due to the formation of a dependency relationship. In the Aegean, Pannonian Plain, and Po Valley for example, the pronounced (though not extreme) changes lie within the long-term parameters of Holocene climate. That is, the climate of the 12th century was not particularly extreme, and similar patterns can be detected at various points in long-term records in the same locales when there was no contemporary social disjuncture.\n\nIt has been proposed that 1200 BC marked a change to the networks that had defined the globalized social world of Europe in the third quarter of the second millennium BC. Before addressing social change in specific areas (Fig. 4), I briefly comment on the evidence for a shift in European-scale networks of interaction to provide a wider context in which to consider specific areas.\n\nMetalwork: A Proxy for Networks of Interaction Linking the Study Areas\n\nTwo of the most significant things that may affect multiple prehistoric societies simultaneously at large geographic scales are long-distance communication networks that support political economies and climate. The former is primarily measurable through the materials that moved through those networks. For the European Bronze Age, metals are particularly relevant as a proxy for interaction. I focus on metals because they constitute a highly visible resource open to multidisciplinary analysis, objects survive in vast quantities, they were exchanged across the entire geography of Europe, and bronze is seen as the economic engine of Bronze Age societies (Earle et al. 2015; Earle and Kristiansen 2010). This dataset also clearly demonstrates that the study areas were all bound together through craft, esthetic, belief, practice/activity, and resource networks. Although a deviation in our narrative on human–climate relations, metals provide an important general backdrop for understanding how the domino effect of climate change affecting political economies in one area could impact others in the highly networked Bronze Age world. Declining conditions in one area must be viewed on a sliding scale from individual settlements to the macroregional scale of the intersocietal networks that shaped each connected society simultaneously.\n\nMetalwork is informative for understanding networks of interaction in three main ways. As a raw material, we can evaluate the networks through which it was exchanged. As cultural objects, we can explore the networks through which particular ideas related to style and purpose/function of metalwork traveled. As material with mutable value (it can be recycled), how it was disposed of can inform us about its management within a society. We only need a general sketch here to demonstrate how changes in metal consumption reflect 1200 BC as a clear turning point in the economic, craft, and ideological networks that connected Europe.\n\nA general pattern in this 1200 BC horizon across the continent is the rapid spread of new styles of military equipment that, typological details aside, represent a profound increase in transcultural military hardware and associated martial traditions (Kristiansen and Suchowska-Ducke 2015; Molloy and Horn 2020). For example, similar sword types emerged in less than 50 years in each study area (Type Reutlingen and successors), and shield types linked each area with at least two of the others (apart perhaps from the Po Valley).\n\nIn Britain, Northover (1982) interpreted trace element patterns in copper alloys as indicative of a fundamental change in the source of metal that was used and/or its management through recycling in the 12th century BC. Metal with this same high-impurity pattern, probably from the eastern Alps, became common throughout western Europe at that time (Rohl and Needham 1998; Williams and de Veslud 2019, p. 1185). Concurrently, continental metalwork forms became increasingly influential in Britain (and Ireland to a lesser extent) and vice versa, marking the establishment of important new long-distance networks through which ideas and materials flowed and disrupted existing insular metal networks. New genetic evidence corroborates this, with networks through which people migrated to southern Britain from the continent emerging after ca. 1500 BC and increasing further in the 12th to 8th centuries (Patterson et al. 2021).\n\nIn Scandinavia, fewer distinct sources of copper were being consumed by ca. 1100 BC than in earlier phases of the Bronze Age (Ling et al. 2014, p. 125). There also was a distinct reduction in the amount of tin invested in metalwork objects made in the 12th century and those made in the 11th century, representing either new conventions or resource limitations (Ling et al. 2014, p. 119). By the end of the 12th century, there was a wholesale reduction in the deposition of metalwork in mortuary contexts, which Kristiansen (2018) identifies as reflecting challenges to the supply network.\n\nIn the Carpathian Basin, in the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the deposition of metal in hoards increased exponentially. New data confirm that Alpine sources became dominant, though there is also evidence for the increased presence of Cypriot copper at this time (Gavranović et al. 2022; Molloy 2019, pp. 148–149). Metal supplied to sites north of the Po Valley continued to come from the nearby Alpine sources, though there are no published analyses of objects from the few surviving sites south of the river. Metalwork styles were increasingly shared between the Po Valley and Carpathian Basin in the 13th and 12th centuries BC (Molloy et al. in press). A subset of these styles, dominated by weaponry, appeared occasionally in the Aegean in the 13th century and then much more frequently in the 12th century. While local metal supplies remained consistent, this transculturation of weapon forms represents a clear change in consumption patterns and social networks as society was reconfigured after the palatial collapse (Iacono 2019; Jung and Mehofer 2013; Molloy 2016).\n\nThe consistent pattern seen in metalwork reveals a sharp change in supply, style, and management from the decades around 1200 BC. On the one hand, this shows continuity of long-distance networks; on the other hand, it shows a narrowing or refocusing of those networks and the political relationships they embodied. It is clear that shifts in the macroscale metal networks of Europe arose from changes to the societies that had formed the powerful nodes that drove long-distance networks.\n\nMycenaean Greece\n\nDefined by shared material culture, the urban groups of southern Greece are commonly called the Mycenaeans, though there was significant variability in how people in different areas participated in this identity (Feuer 2011). In more densely settled areas, there was a hierarchy of settlements from farmsteads to minor urban centers surrounding a small palace complex, though there was regional variation and different takes on the role and organization of central places in settlement networks (Kramer-Hajos 2016). Some communities participated in selected components of Mycenaean identity but had different political systems and hierarchies, many of whom may not have been under the control of a palace.\n\nA wave of destructions at urban centers ca. 1200 BC has classically defined the collapse of the Mycenaean palatial system (Dickinson 2006; Middleton 2010). This phenomenon has been studied extensively, with proposed causes including climate change, earthquakes, environmental collapse, social revolts, mass migrations, changes in warfare, disease, economic overspecialization, and a cocktail of each of these together in systems collapse models (Cline 2021; Drews 1993; Middleton 2010, 2020a).\n\nThe well-known shaft graves at Mycenae were established around 1700 BC, and the famously wealthy tombs there were created in the 16th century. The first signs of Mycenaean urbanism began ca. 1500 BC, and then between 1400 and 1300 BC fortified citadels were constructed at some nascent palatial centers such as Tiryns, Athens (?), Thebes, and Mycenae. Palaces at Pylos, Orchomenos, Dhimini, and Ayios Vasileios were built around the same time but do not appear to have been enclosed. Teichos Dymaion was built in Achaea and was enclosed but lacked a palace (Middleton 2020b). Towns and villages were distributed throughout the landscape, and based on the records from Pylos at least, many in southern Greece were hierarchically ordered within territories that were subject to palatial centers. These palaces themselves had varied successes, for example, Orchomenos appears to have declined by 1300 BC and in the Argolid, the neighboring sites of Mycenae and Tiryns alternated in importance between 1400 and 1100 BC (Mühlenbruch 2020).\n\nPylos provides our highest-resolution data on the functioning of a specific Mycenaean polity through its well-preserved Linear B text archive. Those records tell us that in the 13th century, there were two provinces and a possible four-level hierarchy of sites (Cosmopoulos 2006). There were no citadels; two administrative provinces with many settlements answered to the authority of the palace while operating largely independently on a day-to-day basis. This archive, combined with a destruction level at the nearby major center of Iklaina, suggest conquest or subjugation of the territory of the latter, as the palace extended its reach to unite two polities only decades before widespread collapse (Cosmopoulos 2019). Pylos was destroyed by fire around 1200 BC, and across the Taygetus Mountains, the palace at Ayios Vasileios was destroyed by fire around 1250 BC (Kardamaki 2017).\n\nIn Boeotia, the low-lying Copaic Basin was drained, and the largest citadel in Greece was built at Gla late in the 14th century. This corresponded with the decline of nearby Orchomenos and a destruction horizon at Thebes, followed by rebuilding (Dakouri-Hild 2010, p. 698). These data suggest realignments of power and centrality at the onset of the 13th century.\n\nIn the Argolid, the citadel of Midea was built in the heartland of Mycenae and Tiryns around 1250 BC, calling into question the autonomy of citadels as centers of distinct states. Another indicator of change is the visible decline in prosperity but increased emphasis on defensibility at Mycenae after 1250 BC. This was a time when Tiryns thrived, with expanded fortification enclosing its lower town (Mühlenbruch 2020, pp. 124–126). All urban centers of the Argolid were destroyed by fire ca. 1200 BC, as were the centers at Gla, Dhimini, and Tiryns to the north, and Teichos Dymaion in Achaea. In Crete, the already much-diminished palace at Knossos may have suffered destruction in the late 14th century BC, and an administration there using Linear B survived until 1250 BC at the very latest, while the palatial center at Chania in western Crete was destroyed around 1200 BC.\n\nWe know from Linear B archives dated to the later 13th century that the societies living in those urban centers had become increasingly hierarchized, and so we find centralized administrations with a Wanax (king?) at the top, followed by Lawegatas, Basileus, Eqetes, along with priests and priestesses, scribes, dependent workers, and a civic body called the damos (Middleton 2020b, p. 9). Hierarchies and the use of material culture to construct specific identities in death, particularly the notion of the warrior, demonstrate the relevance of horizontal as well as vertical social differentiation for societies of southern Greece. Surprisingly, we do not yet know if the Wanax referred to in the Linear B tablets from one site was the same individual referred to at other sites, and so how many “rulers” there were, which constitutes a fundamental problem for understanding the political geography of the Mycenaean world (Kelder 2012).\n\nIn every century there were clear changes to the political landscape of the Mycenaean world between 1700 and 1200 BC, and the case of the Pylian state at least strongly implies that conflict and conquest were a part of its developmental history. Destructions of urban centers in the middle of the 13th century at Thebes, Mycenae, and Tiryns point to a regular cycle of conflict, and such destruction cannot be explained away as natural disasters (Hinzen et al. 2018). There was no stable, typical, or “classic” Mycenaean world, but rather a landscape of competing centers that were constantly in a process of becoming. Hindsight may highlight the destructions of 1200 BC as the end of a linear social trajectory; taking the evidence for 12th century nucleated settlements more fully into account, change was clearly part of unpredictable developmental arcs.\n\nIt was essentially the palatial system with its attendant entourage of craftworkers, scribes, and priestesses that collapsed. This was materially characterized by the loss of Linear B writing, sophisticated art, canonical palaces with central hearths, monumental civic and mortuary architecture, and organized military systems. The fiery events that marked the fall of each of the palaces took place within a short period of time (Middleton 2020b, p. 11). In what followed, there was a rejection of palatial architecture in rebuilding activities at sites such as Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea, yet these places remained foci of power for decades after the loss of the palatial administrations. There was little appetite among the surviving residents of the Argolid to reconstruct the palaces, either materially or their underlying ideologies.\n\nIt was in the context of this fundamental reorganization of society in the wake of a period marked by wars and the loss of life, property, and stability that the climate became increasingly arid and the agricultural system dependent on predictable rains potentially became strained. The palynological evidence shows that in some areas this was associated with a contraction of land use, and survey evidence shows the spatial extent of occupation of many landscapes declining. Notably, in Achaea the palynological record from Kotihi lagoon shows little change; we know this area prospered until close to the end of the millennium.\n\nThe completeness of collapse as an unfolding circumstance can arguably be understood as the failure of leaders at urban centers to reestablish stability and stop the depopulation of their areas. This material and ideological disinvestment in central places and their societal frameworks took place in the two to four generations after 1200 BC. For a period, the loss of palatial authorities may have facilitated increased prosperity in previously non-palatial areas, including Achaea, Corinthia, Phokis, or the Euboean Gulf, and even stimulated new forms of commerce, but this brief prosperity declined around 1050 BC (Kramer-Hajos 2016, p. 153, 2020; Moschos 2009; Murray 2017; Souyoudzouglou-Haywood 1999). The failures of the 12th century leaders to effectively reestablish prosperity was a greater signature of system-wide collapse than the destruction of palaces, which had existed for one to two centuries in most cases and were one, albeit an important one, component in settlement networks.\n\nFor many areas, the changing political and settlement systems may be seen as a return to forms that had preceded the period of the palaces and, indeed, may have continued in tandem in non-palatial areas. We might envisage a population recovering from a period of turmoil reverting to simpler and smaller forms of social organization that “worked” for non-palatial communities, but these were then all beset by increasingly arid conditions. Although speculative, it is plausible that the palatial system rewarded specialization rather than diversification in land use in their hinterlands, and so buffering mechanisms were weakly built into the political system. When that collapsed and the territory of polities no doubt contracted, then this required an overhaul of land-use conventions. The increase in aridity narrowed the options and subsistence and/or surplus buffering mechanisms further. It may have been that the path back to larger and complex polities in the ebb and flow of Aegean urbanism, which dated back to the beginning of the second millennium, rather than a rejection of this lifeway, was ultimately truncated in the 12th century BC.\n\nIn the surrounding area, settlement along the Vardar-Axios River and plains around Macedonia in the north show clear continuity from the 12th to 11th centuries (Bulatović et al. 2021; Ruppenstein 2020; Triantaphyllou and Andreou 2020). Indeed, settlement and cemetery records suggest the area prospered and hosted migrants from farther north, potentially people leaving the Pannonian Plain. The hints of different impacts of climate change seen in the Mavri Trypa and Skala Marion caves may be of relevance, as seen also in the relatively unchanged anthropogenic pollen markers in northern Greece for these centuries (Weiberg et al. 2019). In Crete, a broadly similar trend occurred, where a 13th century decline in settlements was reversed around 1220 BC, with many defensible villages established and thriving into the first millennium (Gaignerot-Driessen 2016; Langohr 2020; Nowicki 2018; Wallace 2018).\n\nThe Pannonian Plain\n\nOur knowledge of settlements between 1500 and 1200 BC in the Pannonian Plain has changed dramatically in recent years. The largest prehistoric settlement in Europe prior to the first millennium BC—an enclosure of more than 1750 ha—has been defined at Corneşti Iarcuri (Harding 2017; Heeb et al. 2017; Szentmiklosi et al. 2011). This site was part of a newly discovered network of mega-fort sites in the eastern Pannonian Plain that are characterized by their exceptional size, such as Santana Cetatea Veche, Gradište Iđoš, and Csanádpalota–Földvár (Gogâltan and Sava 2010; Molloy et al. 2020; Sava and Ignat 2016; Szeverenyi et al. 2017). Along the Tisza River, a cluster of more than 100 large and usually enclosed sites, the Tisza site group, has recently been identified (Molloy et al. n.d.). Settlements are commonly located along, or set back from, major water courses and broadly mirror a trend toward wetlands and rivers also seen in the Po Valley (Dalla Longa 2019, p. 101). They occupy some of the lowest points in the flat Pannonian Plain landscape, many at the base of terraces or straddling the lower slope and its base, and they are typically situated adjacent to or are transected by minor waterways (Molloy et al. 2020, p. 6). While (probably winter) rainfall remained higher than it was during the height of the MBA settlement network, low-lying settlement locations demonstrate that water levels were not a major flooding threat. The occupation span of these sites remains to be firmly anchored. Although we know that the earliest sites were built ca. 1600 BC, there was a major investment in construction between 1500 and 1400 BC, a destruction horizon ca. 1300 BC, and limited evidence for occupation after 1200 BC at excavated sites. The initial growth of settlements took place when cooler conditions with higher wintertime precipitation have been modeled. The growth in building activity around 1400 BC coincides with a modeled increase in temperature and aridity, and reduced activity and/or abandonment of sites followed a warm/arid peak and continued high aridity after 1250 BC. Arguing for a collapse, on current data, remains problematic, but in comparing settlement densities in the 13th versus the 12th century, a striking disparity emerges.\n\nWhile tell-centered polities represent complex social entities in the local MBA, very few sites of this period are known from the area that the Tisza site group occupied in the LBA. The dense distribution of large sites in the LBA constitutes an extensification of land use compared to the MBA, though we may also predict intensification of land use for food production, even in the non-occupied parts of the characteristic enclosures. This new mode of utilizing spaces may indicate changed environmental conditions that could support denser settlement than in preceding centuries, in turn suggesting that a LBA-specific form of human-landscape relations emerged. As the δ18O and δ13C data suggest, this was apparently a much less variable and slightly cooler and less wet period than the final centuries of the MBA. Settlement location choices relative to climate may mirror Magny’s argument for northern Italy where societies developed “a peculiar socio-economic organization” dependent on humid conditions and exploited a particular niche hydrology that promoted habitation on the fringe of wetlands (Magny et al. 2009, p. 586).\n\nMonumentality took on a new relevance in these settlement systems when we compare their scale of tens to hundreds of hectares to the preceding settlement forms that include tells that rarely extended to 10 ha (Nicodemus and O’Shea 2019). It is apparent that a large footprint was a primary concern in the LBA, as the largest settlements represented massive investments of labor. This new system emerged at the same time as changes in cemetery locations and rituals, so that by 1400 BC, there was an almost exclusive shift to cremation burials in flat cemeteries in tandem with excarnation or other modes of manipulation of the un-cremated remains detected at all excavated settlements. A new ceramic stylistic tradition, commonly called Belegiš II, developed by ca. 1400 BC and came to be used across an unprecedentedly large area (Cardarelli et al. 2020; Molloy et al. in press). Its presence marked the narrowing of diversity in ceramic markers of cultural distinctiveness in the east and south Pannonian Plain, signaling widening participation in a common cultural norm. The overall picture for the LBA is one of a newly established political and social system that was manifested across most fields of social practice and covered a substantial portion of the Pannonian Plain.\n\nOnly four LBA fortified sites have been excavated and dated, thus, far. Following a building spurt in the 15th century, a possible horizon of conflict is evident between 1400 and 1300 BC when destruction horizons occurred at Santana, Gradište Iđoš, and Corneşti Iarcuri (Gogâltan et al. 2019; Lehmpuhl et al. 2019; Molloy et al. 2020). There was less intensive occupation at Corneşti Iarcuri after this, and Santana may have been abandoned. Other sites appear to have been abandoned slightly later, between 1250 and 1150 BC at Gradište Iđoš and Csanádpalota–Földvár, for example. In the southeastern plain, almost all cemeteries were abandoned after 1200, with a lower visibility of burials dated to the 12th to 11th centuries (Bukvić 2000; Duffy et al. 2019; O’Shea et al. 2019; Petrović 2007; Todorović 1977; Vranić et al. 2002).\n\nSettlement evidence is much reduced in general between 1200 and 1050 BC in the southern Pannonian Plain, and monumental central sites of any kind are unknown. While systematic survey is rare, Bóka (2012, fig. 5) and Száraz (2017) show “Gava period” sites were well distributed in the Körös area and Zala County in Hungary, respectively. For the Körös microregion, just north of the above fortified sites, this Gava typo-chronological period is framed as 1200–900 BC, and so shifts within this bracket are insufficiently clear. In Zala County, the number of sites fell from 122 sites dated broadly to 1300–1100 BC to 22 sites in 1100–900 BC. There remain significant problems with dating ceramics from survey finds and some surveys do not effectively disaggregate material from 1500 to 1000 BC (Artursson 2010; Bóka et al. 2017; but see Duffy et al. 2019).\n\nMBA settlements favored naturally raised areas close to rivers with sufficient surrounding farmland. One explanation for change in the LBA is that the reduced rainfall coupled with reduced variability on a decadal scale apparent in hydroclimate proxies rendered large tracts of previously uninhabitable or undesirable areas more predictably accessible and valuable. This landscape is remarkably flat, and small changes in the water table can significantly impact potential land use. The close relationship between site locations and minor waterways running through or adjacent to them may also help explain their abandonment, should those waterways have become less active as aridity increased in 13th to 12th centuries. French’s (2010) work in the Benta Valley farther northwest in the plain suggests precisely this phenomenon took place and further analyses are required to test this in the area of the Tisza site group.\n\nAround the Pannonian Plain to the north and east, new settlements in the hills were commonly fortified, but they were as a rule much smaller in extent than the LBA forts. In the Transylvanian Plateau, the Noua and Wittenburg cultural traditions came to an end in the 14th to 13th century BC (Quinn et al. 2020, pp. 51–53). A new wave of settlement building there was contemporary to increased use of Gava-type pottery, closely related to the Belegiš forms used in the Pannonian Plain. Over 30 “Gava settlements” are known in Transylvania alone, dated broadly to 1200 to 900 BC; the majority are east of the Apuseni Mountains, away from the Pannonian Plain (Bălen 2013, pl. 1). These Transylvanian sites occupied a different topographic and environmental microclimate, away from major travel corridors and in more naturally defensible topographic positions. Several of those built after 1050 CalBC were very densely occupied, for example those at Căuaş-Sighetiu and Teleac (Kienlin et al. 2012; Metzner-Nebelsick 2010, 2012; Uhnér et al. 2019). By ca. 1050 BC, there are signs of a resurgence of enclosed settlements in the Pannonian Plain, though these are of a much-reduced size, and in some cases these occur as small enclosures within the ruins of much larger LBA forts (Molloy et al. 2020).\n\nTo the south, new defensible and open settlements emerged in the 12th century BC in the Morava and Vardar-Axios Valleys leading to Greece; they were characterized by the adoption of Carpathian-style channel-decorated pottery (Bulatović et al. 2021). As the Pannonian Plain became depopulated, its material culture traditions were increasingly influential elsewhere, suggesting an element of outward, no doubt gradual, migration.\n\nWith abandonment of the mega-forts by ca. 1200 BC, there was an exponential increase in the practice of hoarding somewhere between 1300 and 1100 BC (Gogâltan and Rezi 2019). There are many complex discussions about the purpose of hoarding, but a common strand is that they were a crisis response, whether hiding wealth from attackers or seeking to propitiate divine forces in the face of increased social challenges (Bradley 1990; Dietrich 2014; Fontijn 2013; 2019; Turk 2001; Turk and Čerče 1996). This latter may well include changes in the predictability or nature of weather patterns, as seen in the hydroclimate data for this same window of time. It is relevant that most hoards were deposited in or close to watercourses. It is conceivable that the increase in hoarding from the 13th century on was the kind of \"doubling down\" on ritual practices argued to be a response to extraneously introduced society-wide crises, such as climate change, showing past awareness that conditions were changing (Johnson 2017). These same items of metalwork are also indicative of changes in military practice, with the invention of shields, greaves, and possibly helmets and new forms of sword and spear emerging in the 13th to 12th centuries. These represent fundamental changes in the nature of warfare in Europe (Molloy and Horn 2020).\n\nOverall, the system in place between 1400 and 1200 BC supported the presence of densely spaced, large, and enclosed sites in the southern Pannonian Plain indicative of a substantial population. Whatever changed, it was sufficient to render that system unsustainable, and areas of the landscape that had supported large populations ceased to do so.\n\nThe Po Valley\n\nThe density, and complexity, of settlement in the Po Valley between 1500 and 1150 BC was unprecedented there. Settlement was characterized by Terramare sites defined as “quadrangular settlements surrounded by an artificial embankment and ditch into which the waters of a nearby river or natural canal were re-routed” and a smaller number of Palfitte sites, which were water-side pile dwellings (Cavazzuti et al. 2019a, p. 625). These communities shared material culture, craft, domestic, and mortuary traditions. In the mountains to the north and south, copper deposits were exploited when the Terramare system was at its height (Ling et al. 2014, 2019). Although not all were occupied at the same time, as many as 220 Terramare sites have been identified (Cardarelli 2009; Cavazzuti et al. 2019a, p. 625; Kristiansen 2016, p. 172).\n\nThere was a rapid increase in population in the final stages of the MBA at a rate that cannot be accounted for by local population growth, and it has been speculated that migrants from the Pannonian Plain contributed to this (Cardarelli 2009; Molloy et al. in press). Incremental growth of population is documented in some areas, primarily north of the Po River, suggesting that even if migration was important for the emergence of th"
