Within weeks of its launch early on the morning of 22 June 1941, the frontline stretched a staggering 2780 miles (4480 km), linking the Arctic wastes of the Barents Sea in the north to the sub-tropical shores of the Black Sea in the south. At first glance, the opposing armies appeared to be almost evenly matched. The Germans committed 120 divisions to the initial assault, holding a further 26 in immediate reserve, making a total of 146 divisions - some three million men in all. Facing them, the Soviet army had 149 divisions stationed in its westernmost military districts. But the German and Russian divisions differed greatly in composition and strengths. Take the all-important tank, for example, which played such a crucial role throughout the campaign in the east. At the outset the Germans deployed 17 armoured divisions (plus a further two in reserve) against the Soviet's 36 - a seeming majority of two-to-one in favour of the Red Army. In reality, a Russian armoured division of 1941 numbered some 400 tanks, whereas its German counterpart varied between 150 and 200 . . . a fourfold advantage to the Soviets.\n\nAt the start of Barbarossa the sole single-engined fighter presence in the far north was provided by the ten Bf 109Es of the Jagdstaffel Kirkenes. This E-7 (complete with dust filter!) patrols the barren shores of the Arctic Ocean . . .\n\nOn paper, the Red Air Force enjoyed a similar numerical superiority. It is a little remarked fact that the Luftwaffe embarked upon Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht's most ambitious undertaking, with far fewer frontline aircraft (2598) than it had deployed either at the start of the Blitzkrieg in the west in May 1940 (3826) or at the height of the Battle of Britain some three months later (3705). In terms of single-engined fighters, the Jagdwaffe had exactly 619 serviceable machines (predominantly Bf 109Fs) ranged along the eastern front on the eve of the invasion. This was just over two-thirds (68 per cent) of the fighter arm's total available strength, the remaining third being deployed in the west, the homeland and the Mediterranean. Yet it was in the east that Luftwaffe fighter pilots (understrength and overstretched as they were) would achieve the highest individual scores in the history of aerial warfare - scores that would be deemed impossible in other theatres and by other air forces. Osprey's Aircraft of the Aces series has been based throughout on the accepted British and American definition of an 'ace' as being any fighter pilot with five or more aerial victories to his credit. Using this figure as a yardstick, a volume of this size dealing with the subject of the Bf 109 pilots on the eastern front would perforce consist of little more than a list of names. There are well over 5000 Luftwaffe fighter pilots in this category! In fact, the Jagdwaffe itself did not often use the dogmatic term 'As' (ace) in relation to a specific number of victories. They preferred the more generic Experte', which was taken to mean any pilot of outstanding ability and achievement. The author has spoken to several Luftwaffe fighter pilots credited with 50 or more aerial victories - a far higher total than any western Allied ace - only to be told, in all seriousness, 'I was no great Experte. You really ought to talk to . . . ' , and here would follow the name of some stellar individual with three or four times the number of the speaker's own kills.\n\n.. . whilst at the other end of the 2780-mile (4480-km) long front, this Friedrich rests between sorties safeguarding the Black Sea coast. Assigned to southernmost Jagdgruppe, lll./JG 52, the aircraft was the mount of future Knight's Cross winner Obergefreiter Friedrich Wachowiak\n\nIndicative of the imbalance between the eastern and western fronts, the scoreboard on the rudder of this machine shows that its pilot, Oberfeldwebel Edmund Wagner of 9./JG 51, had claimed just one western victory prior to Barbarossa. With the first snows of the winter just starting to fall, Wagner has already added 54 Soviet kills. He would achieve two more before being killed in action against lowflying Pe-2s on 13 November 1941\n\nAnother of JG 51's NCO pilots, Oberfeldwebel - later Leutnant Otto Gaiser is representative of the many hundreds of eastern front flyers who amassed scores in the high double figures, and yet who are practically unknown today. Gaiser had claimed 74 victories by the time he too was killed in a low-level encounter (this time with four II-2 Stormoviks) early in 1944\n\nIn the history of aerial warfare, only two fighter pilots have achieved more than 300 victories Hauptmann Erich Hartmann (left) and Major Gerhard Barkhorn (right), both of JG 52\n\nll./JG 3's Oberfeldwebel Ullmann points to an area on the map where he has just downed an enemy machine. The Werkmeister of 6. Staffel has reason to look doubtful, for the crash site could not subsequently be located, and the claim remained unconfirmed\n\nThe Luftwaffe hierarchy seems to have been taken almost unawares by the success of its own fighter pilots. In the opening months of the war 20 aerial victories would ensure the claimant the award of the Knight's Cross. Towards the close of hostilities some long-serving pilots would have amassed well over 100 kills in the east before they received this coveted decoration. Nothing better illustrated the yawning chasm between eastern and western front conditions than the prestigious 'century' of kills. Only a select handful of Luftwaffe fighter pilots topped the 100 mark in action solely against the western Allies. By contrast, over 70 pilots achieved this feat in the east. Eight claimed more than 200 victories, and two even surpassed the 300 figure!\n\nOberleutnant Kurt Sochatzy, Staffelkapitan of 7./JG 3, was more fortunate. A witness on the ground took this telephoto shot of one of his victories - a Tupolev twin - as it headed down into the trees with no chance of recovery. Sochatzy claimed 38 Soviet kills (and a single No 603 Sqn Spitfire whilst on the Channel Front) before being rammed during a dogfight with an I-16 over Kiev on 12 August 1941. He would spend the next eight years in captivity in the USSR\n\nIn the light of post-war investigation, it is now conceded that overclaiming occurred in every air force. Mostly this was attributable to the heat and confusion of battle. Sometimes it was a case of genuine error â the trail of smoke emitted by a Bf 109 diving away at full throttle fooled many an Allied fighter pilot or air gunner into believing that his opponent was mortally hit. Only in very rare instances was it a matter of deliberate deceit. And any pilot suspected of falsifying his victory claims was given very short shrift by his peers. Each of the combatant air forces tried to regulate claims by a strict set of conditions. None more so than the Luftwaffe, which required written confirmation of the kill by one or more aerial witnesses to the action, plus - if possible â back-up confirmation, also in writing, from an observer on the ground. Given the amount of paperwork this engendered back at OKL in Berlin, it is little wonder that it could sometimes take a year or more for a pilot's claim to receive official confirmation. Despite such bureaucratic safeguards, some of the more astronomical claims by Luftwaffe pilots on the eastern front still remain the subject of discussion, doubt and downright disbelief. So how were they achieved? There is no simple answer, but rather a unique set of circumstances which was not replicated in any other campaign. Firstly, it must be borne in mind that Luftwaffe pilots did not fly 'tours', with lengthy breaks in between, as was the practice in Allied air forces. Most remained operational until either killed, incapacitated or elevated to a staff position. Apart from periods of leave, there were many who served in frontline units throughout the entire war, from the first day of hostilities until the last. Also, for much of the air war in the east, the Jagdwaffe enjoyed undisputed superiority in those three essentials to survival and success equipment, training and tactics. The Bf 109 was a far better fighting machine than anything the Soviets possessed during the early years of the air war in the east. In the opinion of some veterans it remained so until the very end â 'unencumbered (i.e. without additional underwing weaponry such as gondolas or rocket tubes), the Bf 109 was superior to the Russian Yak-9'.\n\nMajor Gerhard Barkhorn is congratulated upon the completion of his 1000th operational sortie. The ribbons on the garland list the countries over which he has fought since joining II./JG 52 in August 1940 - (from bottom left) Denmark, Belgium, Soviet Union, France, England and Holland. By war's end Barkhorn would have flown no fewer than 1104 missions\n\nSecondly, all Jagdwaffe combat leaders had enjoyed the priceless benefit of thorough training. Ironically, some - such as Lutzow and Trautloft - had even attended the clandestine fighter training school at Lipezk, north of Voronezh, which the Reichswehr had operated in conjunction with the Soviets between the years 1925 to 1933. Many had also flown with the Condor Legion in Spain, and more recently a great number of fighter pilots had seen action in Poland, the west and the Balkans. This wealth of expertise and experience in turn gave them the flexibility to devise new and effective tactics to counter any situation they might meet in the air. Much of the above could equally well apply to all the other campaigns in which the Jagdwaffe was involved. What made the eastern front different was the second half of the equation - the nature and make-up of the opposition. The Stalinist purges of the late 1930s had emasculated the Soviet armed forces, cutting huge swathes through their ranks. Many air force officers, including those with recent combat experience (in Spain, the Far East and Finland), were dismissed, imprisoned or worse. This not only robbed the Red Air Force of an invaluable core of experts, it thoroughly cowed those who remained, stifling any initiative they might otherwise have displayed, and ensuring that they followed every official operational edict to the letter irrespective of the consequences. In an effort to make good the losses brought about by its own actions, the Kremlin then ordered a rapid expansion of Russia's armed forces. But time was not on the Soviets' side. With the emphasis on numbers rather than quality, pilot training was hurried and perfunctory. Consequently their performance was, in general, of a much lower standard than that of the Luftwaffe during the opening rounds of Barbarossa. This inflexibility and inexperience is borne out by the combat reports of German pilots, which are full of accounts of formations of Russian aircraft either 'sticking rigidly to their course and altitude as they were chopped down one by one', or 'milling about in the air like a huge, chaotic swarm of bees'. Inadequate training does not imply lack of courage on the part of the Soviet pilots. Quite the reverse. Unable to bring down their opponents in any other way, many resorted to ramming. Dubbed 'taran' attacks by the Russians, the first recorded instance of this ultimate act of desperation occurred within minutes of the launchofBarbarossa.\n\nThe barrel-like shape of an abandoned I-16 sitting alongside this Friedrich of II./JG 54 illustrates the yawning chasm in design technology between the Soviet and German fighter arms during the opening phases of Barbarossa\n\nAlthough not a high scorer himself, Hannes Trautloft's wealth of early experience - from the Lipezk training establishment to service with the Condor Legion in Spain made him the archetypal fighter leader. He commanded JG 54, the famous 'Green Hearts', from 1940 to 1943\n\nAt 0415 hrs on 22 June Junior Lieutenant D W Kokoryev of the 124th Fighter Regiment knocked the tail off a reconnaissance Do 215 near Sambruv after the guns of his MiG-3 had jammed. Ten minutes later the 46th Regiment's Senior Lieutenant I T Ivanov despatched a He 111 bomber in similar fashion during a dogfight above Rovno. Unlike the former, Ivanov did not survive his encounter. On 2 August he was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The early battles took a heavy toll of the Red Air Force. Anxious to replace their losses and get pilots to the front as quickly as possible, training programmes did not rise above the barely adequate for many months. It was not until the latter stages of the campaign that a marked improvement came about. But by that time the Luftwaffe's many Experten had themselves gained two or three more years of eastern front experience. And although they took no chances with their Soviet opponents - never knowing when they might come up against one of the Red Air Force's 'naturals' - most are convinced that they retained a definite edge over the Russian rank and file throughout. The same totalitarian obsession with numbers governed the Kremlin's dictates to the Soviet aircraft industry. The portly Polikarpovs which had fought for Republican Spain were obsolete or obsolescent by the summer of 1941. Three 'modern' designs had begun to enter service in 1940. But all suffered severe teething problems and were full of faults. The Yak-1 was unreliable and had poor firepower. Both the LaGG-3 and MiG-3 lacked manoeuvrability, and were particularly unforgiving to novice pilots. Those selected to fly the LaGG joked grimly (but only amongst themselves) that the aircraft's initials stood for 'Lacquered Coffin Guaranteed'. Even pilots with many hours on Polikarpovs found the new monoplanes sluggish and hard to handle. Despite this, production figures came before performance. Numbers of aircraft at the front were all that mattered to Moscow. As with the pilot training programmes, the situation gradually improved. Both Lavochkin and Yakovlev subsequently developed excellent fighters out of their original designs. But it all took time. Indeed, the world would have to wait until 1950, and the war in Korea, before discovering what the Mikoyan bureau could really do - and even then the revolutionary\n\nMiG-15 jet fighter relied heavily on captured German research and British engine design. Much has been made of the Lend-Lease aircraft delivered to the Soviet Union to 'bridge the gap' between the initial shock of Barbarossa and Russian industry's gearing up to full production after evacuating its manufacturing plants to safety beyond the Ural mountains. Indeed, between 1941 and 1945 the United States alone despatched close to 10,000 fighters to Russia. But here, too, quantity ruled over quality, for over 7000 of these machines were mid-engined Bell P-39s and P-63s. The former type was deemed 'specially disappointing' as an interceptor by the USAAF, and rejected by the RAF after just one operational mission.

The British also provided over 4000 Hurricanes and Spitfires, and although both types gave a good account of themselves, the latter, in particular, was not ideally suited to the often primitive conditions to be found on Soviet forward landing grounds. Lastly, to tactics. Despite the vast distances involved, the air war in the east was essentially a non-strategic conflict. Both air forces concentrated primarily on direct, medium to low-level support of ground operations. For reasons which will become clear, Luftwaffe fighter pilots were loath to venture too far behind the Russian lines. The Soviet High Command, for its part, was as rigid - and almost as profligate - in the control and use of its pilots and aircrew as it was with its foot soldiers. Just as, on the ground, wave after wave of Red infantrymen would be hurled, regardless of losses, against an entrenched German position in a series of frontal assaults until either none of the attackers was left standing or the defences were overwhelmed, so, in the air, wave after wave of Soviet aircraft were despatched to bomb targets along the German frontline. The defending Luftwaffe fighter pilots, usually based close to the action, often flew as many as five or six - or even more - sorties per day. Patrolling the front, they would dive on the enemy machines, knock down one or two, break up the formation, and then climb back up to altitude to await the next incoming wave. Although an oversimplification, such was the essence of air combat on the eastern front. Attempting to swamp the enemy by sheer weight of numbers, the Soviets bore the inevitable attrition with stoicism. The Luftwaffe's Experten reaped the rewards. As to the campaign itself, the eastern front was divided into three main sections, or axes of advance - northern, central, and southern (four, if one includes the somewhat isolated far northern Finnish/Arctic region, which was a more static area of operations).\n\nDespite the much greater length of the front, the Luftwaffe embarked upon Barbarossa in tried and tested fashion - by mounting a series of pre-emptive strikes that were designed to destroy the enemy air force on the ground. In this they proved remarkably successful. But the seeds of Germany's ultimate defeat had already been sown. Hitler's intention to invade the Soviet Union had first been spelled out in his Fuhrer Directive No 21 of 18 December 1940. He originally planned to launch Operation Barbarossa in the late spring of 1941. But the difficulties his Axis partner Mussolini was experiencing in Greece, and a revolt by the people ofYugoslavia against joining the Tripartite Pact (of Germany, Italy and Japan) persuaded him instead first to subjugate the Balkans. This put Barbarossa back by a few vital weeks. The Wehrmacht's initial objective was Moscow. By 15 November 1941 a reconnaissance detachment of Panzerpionierbataillon 62 was just 12 miles (20 km) short of the Kremlin. But the winter snows brought the German army to a halt. The Russian capital held, and the Fuhrer had lost his one chance for a 'speedy conclusion' to the campaign in the east. The German offensive resumed in the spring of 1942. This time it was aimed not at Moscow, but along the southern sector towards the oilfields of the Caucasus and the city of Stalingrad. The 6. Armee reached Stalingrad late in August, only to be encircled and destroyed there during the winter months of 1942-43. The epic battle of Stalingrad is regarded by many as the turning point of the war in the east. In fact, it was the third annual German offensive, launched on the central sector in the mid-summer of 1943, which really marked the beginning of the end for the Wehrmacht in Russia. Operation Zitadelle, better known as the battle of Kursk, was the greatest tank battle in military history. When Hitler ordered his armour to disengage on 13 July, it was more than a tacit admission of a local reversal. It paved the way for the huge Soviet advances of 1944-45, which would end with the Red Army in the centre of Berlin. This, then, was the broad and sombre canvas against which the most successful fighter pilots the world has ever seen â or is ever likely to see shone so briefly, and yet so brightly.\n\n. . . who is pictured here flying the same E-7 on a Jabo mission only a matter of days later at the start of Barbarossa. In the interim, however, the narrow yellow band aft of the fuselage cross has been dispensed with, and the unit's distinctive 'crazy paving' camouflage pattern is already beginning to show through the thin coat of yellow wash hastily applied to the engine cowling\n\nBARBAROSSA - THE EARLY ADVANCES\n\nT\n\nhe first kill on the eastern front was claimed by the Staffelkapitan of l./JG 3, Oberleutnant Robert Olejnik, who described the historic action in the following report; 'Everybody knew that I was an early riser and liked to fly the dawn missions. So, shortly before 0330 hrs, I took off with my wingman to reconnoitre the Russian airfields along our stretch of the border. 'Everything seemed quiet in the semi-darkness below. It was not until we were returning to base, and flying back over the first airfield we had visited some 20 minutes earlier, that I spotted signs of activity. 'Two Russian fighters were preparing to scramble. As we circled 700-800 metres (2300-2600 ft) overhead, I saw the Russians start their engines and begin to taxi out. They took off immediately and climbed towards us, obviously looking for a fight. 'They were still some 300-400 metres (980-1300 ft) below us when we dived to the attack. I caught the leader with a short burst on my first pass and he went down in flames. His wingman disappeared. 'Arriving back over our own airfield I waggled my wings to indicate a victory. My comrades, most of whom had only just woken up, peered sleepily from their tent flaps shaking their heads in disbelief.' But some confusion surrounds the exact time of Olejnik's kill. The unit diary credited him with the destruction of an I-16 at 0340 hrs - just 25 minutes after the opening artillery salvoes of Barbarossa had rent the pre-dawn darkness - whereas he himself logged the 'Rata' ('Rat') as going down at 0358 hrs.\n\nOberleutnant Robert Olejnik who, by his own account, claimed the first aerial kill of Barbarossa is greeted by his chief mechanic, Feldwebel Mackert, upon his return from another successful mission some weeks later. The Knight's Cross, awarded for 32 victories, is just visible around Olejnik's neck. Note also l./JG 3's 'Tatzelwurm' (Dragon) emblem, which would be retained after the Gruppe's redesignation as II./JG 1\n\n15\n\nAnother strong contender for the distinction of claiming the first aerial kill of the eastern front campaign must therefore be 5./JG 27's Leutnant Hans Witzel, who downed one I-15 at 0354 hrs, followed by another just 60 seconds later. One fact not in dispute, however, was that the Luftwaffe's pre-emptive strikes had caught the Soviet Air Force completely off guard. All along the front the scene was the same as that described by Robert Olejnik's Gruppenkommandeur, veteran Channel front Experte Hauptmann Hans von Hahn; 'We could hardly believe our eyes. Every airfield was chock full of reconnaissance aircraft, bombers and fighters, all lined up in long straight rows as if on a parade. The number of landing strips and aircraft the Russians had concentrated along our borders was staggering.' Staggering, too, was the price the Soviets paid for their unpreparedness. The Luftwaffe fighter pilots had a field day. In the northern sector Major Hannes Trautloft's JG 54 had claimed 45 Russian aircraft shot down by the close of the first day's fighting, and the attached II./JG 53 had added a dozen more.\n\nA Luftwaffe reconnaissance photo of a Soviet airfield with rows of fighters lined up wingtip to wingtip.

Of the nearly two-dozen aircraft visible here, all but two have been reduced to piles of wreckage. Although seemingly intact, the I-16 at the top of the picture is resting on its starboard wingtip.

Like the Kommandeur's fifth victory of the day, it was identified as an 'I-17', and has already been recorded by the single bar seen here at the top of the rudder hinge line of Harder's Friedrich\n\n'If an aircraft looks right, it is right' But not always. The MiG-3's sleek lines belied its sluggish performance in the air, while on the ground the length of that streamlined cowling meant that forward visibility when taxying was almost nil\n\nJG 53's other two Gruppen, deployed in the central sector - the scene of the invasion's main thrust accounted for no fewer than 62 Soviet aircraft. Hauptmann Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke, Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 53, was perhaps the eastern front's first ace, for he downed five Soviet fighters in the course of three separate sorties on 22 June. Wilcke's victims comprised a trio of I-15s shortly after 0400 hrs, a single I-16 later in the morning, and an 'I-17' in the afternoon. The actual identity of Wilcke's fifth and final kill of the day remains conjectural. The shortcomings of Germany's intelligence services, combined with an almost paranoid secrecy on the part of the Soviets, meant that the Luftwaffe embarked upon Barbarossa without a proper grasp of the Soviets' - admittedly , somewhat complicated - system of aircraft designation. This in turn has meant that there is a great deal of confusion surrounding many of the early claims submitted by German fighter pilots. The I-17, for example, was a Polikarpov design of the mid-1950s. It was powered by a water-cooled engine in a long streamlined nacelle, but never progressed beyond the prototype stage. Nearly every reference to an 'I-17' (or 'I-18') shot down during the opening months of the war in the east was almost certainly the result of an encounter with one of the 'new'\n\ngeneration of Russian in-line engined fighters - almost certainly the MiG-3, which did bear more than a passing resemblance to published photos of the earlier Polikarpov I-17, and which was in service in far greater numbers at the beginning of Barbarossa than either of its Lavochkin or Yakovlev contemporaries. Many Luftwaffe pilots also retained the habit (prevalent in the days of the Condor Legion) of referring to Polikarpov biplanes as 'Curtiss' fighters. Likewise, the Soviets' Tupolev SB-2 twin-engined bombers were commonly known as 'Martins' on account of their similarity to the American Martin B-10. Future Knight's Cross holder Franz Schiess, who flew with the Geschwaderstab ofJG 53, quickly developed a healthy respect for the agile Polikarpovs; 'We became involved with a group of about 20 Curtiss fighters, whose pilots clearly knew what they were doing. They let us get on their tails and almost into firing position. Then they suddenly pulled a 180-degree turn and we found ourselves shooting at them from head-on. In such a situation a kill becomes a matter of luck.' Schiess nevertheless managed to claim his first victory - an I-153 - at 0725 hrs on that 22 June. Also in the central sector, JG 51 was credited with 69 aerial victories. Four of that number had fallen to the guns of the Geschwaderkommodore, Oberstleutnant Werner Molders. This took his personal score to 72, and won him the immediate award of the Swords to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (just one day after the same honour had been conferred upon his arch rival, Oberstleutnant Adolf Galland, Kommodore of JG 26 back in France - see Osprey Aircraft of the Aces 29 - Bf109F/G/KAces on the Western Front). 'Vati' ('Daddy') Molders, arguably the most famous and revered Luftwaffe fighter pilot of them all, had warned his pilots on the eve of Barbarossa that the coming campaign against Russia would not only be hard, but could also last a very long time. He would not live to see his predictions come true. In just three weeks of action against the Soviets he added another 27 kills to his tally. Then, on 15 July, two more victories brought his total to 101. Molders, who had not only been the Condor Legion's top scorer with 14 kills, but had also been the first Luftwaffe pilot to achieve 20 victories in World War 2, and thus received the Jagdwaffe's first Knight's Cross, had now become the first fighter pilot in history to reach the century mark. This feat earned him the Diamonds to his Swords (in yet another 'first', he was the first of only 27 members of the entire German armed forces â seven of them Jagdflieger â to receive this prestigious decoration. But the award of the Diamonds brought\n\nOberst Werner Molders, the Luftwaffe's first General der Jagdflieger, is seen on a tour of inspection in the early autumn of 1941. He is flanked by Major Gunther Lutzow, Kommodore of JG 3 (right), and Hauptmann KarlGottfried Nordmann, Kommandeur of IV./JG 51 (left). The latter pair are both already wearing the Oak Leaves to their Knight's Crosses (awarded in July and September for 42 and 59 victories respectively)\n\nwith it an immediate ban on all further operational flying. Promoted to the rank of Oberst, Werner Molders was appointed to the newlyestablished office of General derJagdflieger. It was while on a tour of inspection of fighter units on the eastern front in November 1941 that he was informed of the death of World War 1 ace Ernst Udet, and instructed to return forthwith to Berlin to form part of the guard of honour at the late Generalluftzeugmeister's (Chief of Aircraft Procurement and Supply's) state funeral. Molders took off for the German capital in a Heinkel He 111. The weather was appalling, with the forecasters predicting that even worse was to come. But Molders overrode the Heinkel pilot's objections and ordered him to continue - he had to get to Berlin on time. After departing Lemberg (Lvov) on the last leg of the flight, however, conditions deteriorated to such an extent that even the General der Jagdflieger was forced to admit defeat. He instructed the pilot to head for the nearest airfield. Now reportedly flying on only one engine, the Heinkel crabbed towards Breslau. During the final approach a factory chimney suddenly loomed out of the murk and driving rain. The experienced NCO pilot managed to avoid the obstacle, but could then no longer hold the wallowing transport. It smashed to earth on Martin Quander's poultry farm at exactly 1130 hrs on 22 November. The whole nation mourned the passing of one of its greatest heroes. A plaque to mark the spot where Molders had perished was erected on Quander's premises at No 132 Flughafenstrasse (Airfield Road) - they had come that close to making it! But to return to the opening day of Barbarossa. The third Jagdgeschwader deployed on the central sector was JG 27 (more accurately, that unit's II. and III. Gruppen, plus the attached II. /JG 52, the latter taking the place of the absent I./JG 27, which was currently in North Africa). These Gruppen achieved far fewer aerial victories in their first pre-emptive strikes against the Red Air Force. II. and III./JG 27, for example, were credited with just eleven and two kills respectively. The two southern sector Jagdgeschwader, JGs 3 and 77, also submitted far fewer claims than the bulk of the units stationed along the central and northern fronts. JG 3's kills totalled 25, including one (listed as an 'I-18') for GeschwaderkommodoreMajor Gunther Lutzow. The majority of the victories, 15 in all, had been achieved by Hauptmann Lothar Keller's II./JG 3. The Gruppenkommandeur himself claimed four - a brace each of I-16s and I-153s - which took his overall score to 20. Four of Keller's pilots opened their scoreboards on this day too. Among them was Oberleutnant Walther Dahl - a future Oak Leaves recipient, noted Sturm leader, and the Luftwaffe's last Inspekteur der Tagjager (Inspector of Day Fighters) - whose first kill was another 'I-18'. JG 77's III. Gruppe were responsible for all 15 of that Geschwader's successes, Oberleutnant Kurt Ubben, Staffelkapitan of 8./JG 77, downing two of them - an I-16 and an Ilyushin DB-3 bomber. He too would go on to win the Oak Leaves, but unlike Dahl, he would not survive the war. Risen to the command of JG 2, Major Kurt Ubben was killed in action over France in the spring of 1944 (see Osprey Aviation Elite 1 - Jagdgeschwader 2 'Richthofen for further details).\n\nOne of the main reasons for the widely diverging levels of claims for aerial victories submitted by the various Jagdgruppen on 22 June 1941 was that many of their number were employed primarily on ground-attack missions throughout the opening phases of Barbarossa. Although the Luftwaffe threw some 35 Kampf- and Stukagruppen into the initial strikes against the Soviet Air Force on the ground, so numerous - and so crowded - were Russia's airfields along her western borders that a substantial proportion of the German fighter force had to fly bombing missions too. The weapon they were to use was the recently introduced SD-2 Splitterbombe (fragmentation bomb, also called the 'Butterfly' bomb). Weighing only 2 kg (4.4 lbs), this devilish little device, which could be fused to explode either on or before impact with the ground, had been developed as an anti-personnel weapon. But, if dropped in sufficient numbers, it could also do a lot of damage to rows of parked aircraft. And each Bf 109 could carry 96 Splitterbomben! Shuttling back and forth between their bases and the target airfields just beyond the frontier, the bomb-laden Bf 109s did indeed wreak considerable havoc. And although of short duration, such missions were not at all popular with the pilots who had to fly them. Firstly, the four bulky panniers (arranged in two tandem pairs) from which the SD-2 were suspended had a marked effect on the Bf 109's performance and handling characteristics. Secondly, for maximum effect, the bombs had to be salvoed from an altitude ofjust 40 metres (130 ft), at which height Soviet small-arms fire was at its most vicious. But, perhaps most alarming of all, the SD-2 had an unfortunate tendency to hang up. At any sort of speed - and, for obvious reasons, pilots did not dawdle when making low-level runs across an enemy airfield - the build-up of air pressure held the SD-2s in place in their racks; particularly the eight bombs of the two front rows. It was only when the fighter slowed down â on approaching to land back at base, for example - that the last of any remaining bombs fell away. Numerous reports from this time note that incoming Bf 109s could often be distinguished by the trail of small explosions left in their wake. Worst still was the fact that some SD-2s did not release until the fighter was actually taxying in. A number of casualties were incurred. It soon became standard practice for returning Bf 109s to make a low (but high-speed!) pass across their home fields to allow observers on the ground to confirm that their bomb racks were indeed empty. Only when they got the all-clear from below did the pilots then come in to land. It is not known how many Soviet aircraft the Bf 109 fighter-bombers accounted for in such raids, but Russian losses on the ground far exceeded the number of machines shot down on 22 June. By the close of the day's operations it was estimated that the Red Air Force had lost 322 aircraft to fighters and flak, but that some 1500 had been destroyed on the ground. Such was the magnitude of the enemy's losses that Hermann Goring at first refused to believe the reports of his pilots' successes. He ordered an\n\nThe SD-2 Splitterbombe in its fully-armed state. After release, the outer casing's two clamshell halves sprang open to form a kind of parachute to retard the bomb's fall. They in turn freed a pair of circular discs which acted as a wind vane as they rotated about, and moved up, the short steel cable. This action fused the bomb's 7.5-oz (212-gr) charge of TNT\n\nenquiry. Within days the advancing German army had overrun all 31 of the airfields which had been the targets of the Luftwaffe's pre-emptive opening strikes. This allowed examination of the wreckage, and showed that the initial reports submitted to the Reichsmarschall had, if anything, erred on the conservative side. Even the official Soviet history of the Great Patriotic War - not a work noted for its objectivity- conceded that, 'By midday of 22 June our losses totalled approximately 1200 aircraft, including more than 800 machines destroyed on the ground'. Against this the Luftwaffe recorded the loss of just 35 aircraft of all types. Casualties among the fighter arm were light, but included three unit leaders. Knight's Cross holder Hauptmann Heinz Bretnutz, Gruppenkommandeur of IL/JG 53, downed a Soviet SB-2 bomber, but was himself wounded. Forced-landing behind enemy lines, Bretnutz was hidden by friendly farmers, who tended his injuries as best they could until the arrival of the first German spearheads on 26 June. Despite an emergency operation to amputate a gangrenous leg, Heinz Bretnutz died in hospital the following day. Grim as the fate of' 'Pietsch' Bretnutz may have been, that of the other two was infinitely worse. Major Wolfgang Schellmann, Kommodore of JG 27, and Oberleutnant Willy Stange, Staffelkapitan of 8./JG 3, both came down behind Russian lines. The former was forced to take to his parachute when hisEmilwas damaged by debris from the I-16 he had just destroyed, whilst the latter crash-landed his Friedrich after being hit by flak. Both fell into the hands of Soviet troops and were killed. The barbaric treatment meted out to downed flyers, particularly during the early stages of Barbarossa, was yet one more facet of the aerial war in the east which set it apart from all other European air campaigns. The threat of capture was never far from the minds of single-engined fighter pilots whenever they were required to fly deep into Soviet-held territory. Although the Luftwaffe's initial strikes had inflicted enormous damage, the Red Air Force was by no means neutralised. As early as midday on 22 June penny-packet formations of Soviet medium bombers were beginning to hit back at the German invaders. Throughout the last week of June these attacks grew in strength and frequency, but they were ill-planned and lacked both cohesion and adequate fighter cover. Unlike the longer range bombers, much of the western districts' fighter strength had been deployed - and destroyed - on those frontier airfields targeted at the start of the campaign. As each rigid formation of bombers approached, it was set upon by Luftwaffe fighters. Individual and unit scores began to escalate rapidly as old hands - 'alte Hasen' ('old hares') in the vernacular of the Jagdwaffeadded to their already considerable numbers of western victories and newcomers, their names as yet unfamiliar, achieved their first kills. On 23 June it was estimated that over 775 Soviet aircraft had been destroyed (again, many of them on the ground). But by the following day most of the action was aloft, with JG 51 being credited with no fewer than 57 'Martin' bombers shot down. Twenty-four hours later II./JG 27 and III./JG 53 each claimed 25 bombers apiece. 5./JG 27's Leutnant Gustav Langanke, whose sole victory to date had been a Hurricane downed in the London area the previous September,\n\nMajor Wolfgang Schellmann, Geschwaderkommodore of JG 27, was forced to take to his parachute over enemy territory on the opening day of Barbarossa and was reportedly shot by the NKVD 48 hours later\n\n21\n\nwas alone responsible for the destruction of seven Tupolevs (but he would add nothing further to his total before being killed in action against South African Marylands over Libya some three months later). At least three of III./JG 53's pilots claimed triple kills. Among Feldwebel Hermann Neuhoff's trio was an Ilyushin Il-2, one of the earliest examples of the Soviet Air Force's heavily-armoured Stormovik ground-attack aircraft to be brought down. On that same 25 June II./JG 51 produced another 'instant ace' when Oberleutnant Hans Kolbow, the Kapitan of 5. Staffel, shot down five Russian bombers in a row - Kolbow already had 13 western kills to his credit. To this he would add another 14 in the east, including the five on 25 June, before being brought down by Soviet ground fire on 16 July. He was awarded a posthumous Knight's Cross 11 days later. The most spectacular success of all came about on 30 June when the Red Air Force hurled hundreds of bombers against the central sector. Everything that could fly was sortied, including antiquated Tupolev TB-3 four-engined heavy bombers. In reply, JG 51's three Gruppen put up 157 individual sorties. Sixty pilots returned to base with one or more victories, resulting in the Geschwader being credited with 113 kills in total! Among the total was JG 51's 1000th enemy aircraft destroyed since the outbreak of war. It was the first unit within the Jagdwaffe to reach this figure. Three pilots had claimed five kills apiece on this day. Kommodore Werner Molders' five took his personal score to 82, thereby surpassing the world record 80 victories set by the immortal 'Red Baron', Rittmeister Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, in World War 1. The other two claimants were the Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 51, Oak Leaves wearer Hauptmann Hermann-Friedrich Joppien, and a certain Leutnant Heinz 'Pritzl' Bar, who was to become one of the Jagdwaffe's true greats. Several other members of JG 51, including Hauptleute Josef Fozo and Richard Leppla, the Kommandeure of II. and III. Gruppe respectively, took their scores to 20 or more during the course of the day's fighting. Hitherto the 'magic 20' had automatically brought with it the award of the Knight's Cross. But with the war in the east little more than a week old, a total of just 20 kills no longer guaranteed this coveted honour. So many Soviet aircraft were being shot down that more stringent requirements were already being applied to the winning of the award in order not to devalue it. The damage being inflicted upon the Red Air Force was undoubtedly enormous. On 29 June the Luftwaffe had reported to the OKW (High Command of the Armed Forces) the destruction of 4017 aircraft on the ground and in the air. No longer the sceptic, Reichsmarschall Goring thereupon announced that, 'In the first week of the campaign the Luftwaffe has destroyed 4990 enemy aircraft for the loss of 179 of its own.' The opening phase of Barbarossa was coming to an end. In the air the Luftwaffe had delivered its knockout blow to the Soviet Air Force. Although not mortal, it had succeeded in securing for the Germans mastery of the skies for the months ahead - long enough, it was confidently assumed by most, for the campaign to reach the 'speedy conclusion' demanded by Hitler.\n\nBf 109s of JG 51 occupy a Russian airfield as the advance into the Soviet Union gets underway. Note the abandoned I-153s among the trees on the left\n\nOne of Werner Molders' earliest duties as General der Jagdflieger was to make a welcome return visit to lll./JG 53, the Gruppe he had formed and first commanded in October 1939. The occasion was the award of the Knight's Cross to Leutnant Erich Schmidt on 23 July for his 30 victories (17 of them in the west). From left to right are Oberst Molders, Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann Wilcke and Leutnant Schmidt\n\nJust over a month later, on 27 August, and Schmidt (top left) watches the 44th kill bar being applied to the rudder of his Friedrich. Four days - and three victories - later still, Erich Schmidt would be reported missing, shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft fire near Dubno, in the Ukraine\n\nOn the ground, too, the Russian frontier defences had been thoroughly breached. The way now lay open for the advance on Moscow, the key to victory in the east. At the beginning of July the two armoured groups deployed along the central sector broke out of the Beresina bridgehead and began to push towards the Russian capital. They were supported by the Bf 109s of JG 51. With few Soviet fighters in evidence, the Geschwader was rarely called upon for bomber escort duties, instead flying mainly freie Jagd sweeps and ground-attack missions. At least one Staffel continued to operate in the fighter-bomber role against enemy airfields, but pilots no longer had to contend with the temperamental SD-2 Splitterbomben, their aircraft being equipped instead to carry four 50-kg bombs. On 12 July Hauptmann Leppla claimed JG 51's 500th Soviet victim (which also proved to be the Geschwader's 1200th aerial victory of the war). But the pressure of the past three weeks' constant campaigning was beginning to tell. Although only six pilots had been killed or reported missing during that time, the three Gruppen had, between them, written off 89 Bf 109s - for which they had received just 49 replacements. The Geschwader was operating at less than half its normal establishment. And of those 58 fighters which were serviceable, 22 had engines with more than 50 hours' flying time which needed urgent overhaul.\n\nAlready a seasoned campaigner his first kill had been a French Morane claimed on 14 March 1940, the famous 'Day of the Fighters' Oberleutnant Franz 'Altvater' ('Old Father') Gotz of 9./JG 53 knew the value of grabbing 40 winks whenever the chance presented itself. He was another who would remain in frontline service until the very end of the war, by which time he had risen to become Kommodore of JG 26 in the west\n\nLooking almost as relaxed as 'Altvater' Gotz, 'Furst' ('Prince') Wilcke enjoys a cigarette in the company of two of his Gruppe's leading Experten, namely Leutnants Herbert Schramm (left) and Erich Schmidt (right). Wilcke and Schramm were both awarded the Knight's Cross on 6 August\n\nDespite such problems, JG 51 continued to take a toll of the Soviet Air Force. The Kommodore's century on 15 July was the cause for great celebration, and four days later Werner Molders passed command of the Geschwader to Major Friedrich Beckh and departed to assume his duties as the Luftwaffe's first General der Jagdflieger. Molders' new post was no sinecure. It was clear that the Jagdwaffe was becoming dangerously overstretched. Already committed in western Europe and the Mediterranean, the German fighter arm was now waging war on three fronts. The very size of the new theatre, the huge distances to be covered and the vast areas to be controlled were simply too much for the number of fighters available. As a consequence, July was to witness not only the first transfer of units from one part of the eastern front to another (such transfers would become increasingly frequent as the campaign wore on), but also the withdrawal of the first Jagdgruppe to meet the more 'pressing' operational demands of another theatre. The latter was Hauptmann Wolfgang Lippert's II./JG 27. After just four weeks in the east, which had netted a total of 42 victories, II./JG 27 returned to Germany to re-equip with Bf 109Fs, before staging southwards to join I. Gruppe in Africa. To make up for the departed II./JG 27, Hauptmann Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke's III./JG 53 was temporarily subordinated to Stab JG 27 (commanded since the disappearance of Wolfgang Schellmann by Major Bernhard Woldenga). Throughout the late summer and early autumn JG 27's three main component Gruppen (III./JG .27, II./JG 52 and III./JG 53) also supported the central sector armies' advance on Moscow. By far the most successful of III./JG 27's pilots at this time was Oberleutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck, the Kapitan of 9. Staffel, who added 48 eastern front victories to his previous tally of 17 western kills (and gained the Knight's Cross in the process) before both the Geschwaderstab and III./JG 27 withdrew from Russia in mid-October to fight alongside the unit's other two Gruppen in North Africa. During the same period the attached III./JG 53 had claimed some 200 kills. The Gruppe's three leading scorers in the east were Oberleutnant Franz Gotz, Staffelkapitan of 9./JG 53, with 23 victories, 7. Staffel's Oberfeldwebel Hermann Neuhoff with 21, and Hauptmann Wilcke with 20. Wilcke was awarded the Knight's Cross on 6 August for achieving 25 kills (the first 13 of them in the west), but both Gotz and Neuhoff would have to wait until the following year, and the destruction of 40 enemy aircraft each, before they were similarly honoured. One member of II./]G 52 also received the Knight's Cross at this juncture. Oberleutnant Johannes Steinhoff, Kapitan of 4. Staffel, had claimed 35 victories by the time of his award on 30 August. Destined to become one of the Jagdwaffe's most\n\nA later photograph of Hauptmann Johannes 'Macki' Steinhoff after his promotion to the command of II./JG 52 early in 1942. The lettering on the leading edge of the port wing specifies the largest permissible tyre size for this particular machine's mainwheels\n\nJG 54's advance through the Baltic states took them to Schaulen, (Siauliai) in Lithuania, where they found this motley collection of abandoned enemy aircraft. Among the usual assortment of l-16s, MiG3s and SB-2s, note the ex-Lithuanian Air Force Gloster Gladiator fighters (background left) purchased from Great Britain before the war\n\nrespected unit leaders, 'Macki' Steinhoff would amass 148 kills on the eastern front. But there was another pilot within the Gruppe who would achieve more than double that total. Leutnant Gerhard Barkhorn had already served with II./JG 52 for over a year by the time he finally shot down his first enemy aircraft on 2 July - this was his 120th mission! This solitary victory was in itself an unremarkable event, except for the fact that Barkhorn would go on to add exactly 300 more to become the second-highest scoring fighter pilot in history. While existing scores were being added to, and new reputations being launched on the road to Moscow, other Jagdgruppen were achieving similar results on either flank of the German advance into the Soviet Union. The sole Jagdgeschwader deployed on the northern sector was Major Hannes Trautloft's JG 54 (initially with 4. and 5. Stajfeln of JG 53 attached). Its task was to provide aerial support during Heeresgruppe Nord's drive through the Baltic states towards the great Soviet naval base of Leningrad, Russia's second largest city and one-time capital. The Geschwader's first major success came on 29 June when large formations of bombers attacked the Dvina bridges in an attempt to halt the Panzers' advance. By the end of the day JG 54 had downed 65 of their number, and on 18 July the Geschwader claimed its 500th Russian victim. Twenty-four hours later another of the eastern front's true 'greats' opened his scoreboard when 9./JG 54's Leutnant Walter Nowotny destroyed a trio of I-153s over the Baltic island of Osel. Nowotny's career\n\nalmost ended there and then, however, for he was himself shot down during the engagement and only just survived three days and nights in a rubber dinghy. Kommodore Hannes Trautloft's Knight's Cross, awarded on 27 July for 20 victories, was but the first of a number conferred upon members of JG 54 during the push on Leningrad. On 1 August JG 54 became the third Jagdgeschwader to achieve 1000 aerial victories since the outbreak of war - although widely separated and on different sectors of the front, JG 3's component Gruppen had achieved their collective 'thousandth' just the day before. Already wearing the Knight's Cross, Oberleutnant Hans 'Fips' Philipp, Staffelkapitan of 4./JG 54, won the Geschwader's first Oak Leaves (for 62 victories) on 24 August. Less than a fortnight later the German army was at the gates of Leningrad. Early in September JG 54 took up residence on the Russian airfields at Siverskaya and Krasnogvardeisk, and these would remain their principal bases for much of the epic 900-day siege of Leningrad that was now about to begin. The city, its naval installations, and the surrounding area were subjected to constant aerial bombardment. One of the first major raids was mounted on 9 September, when JG 54's fighters escorted Ju 87 dive-bombers of StG 2 against units of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. But the day was marred by the loss of Oberleutnant Hubert Mutherich, Staffelkapitan of 5./JG 54 and one of the recent Knight's Cross recipients, who was killed when his aircraft somersaulted while attempting a forcedlanding. At the time of his death 'Hubs' Mutherich had a total of 43 victories, 33 of them claimed since the beginning of Barbarossa. JG 54 was to lose another Knight's Cross wearer, of longer standing, on 30 September when the Kommandeur of III. Gruppe, Hauptmann Arnold Lignitz, shed a wing during a dogfight over Leningrad. Before the fighter spun in, Lignitz was able to take to his parachute. He was last seen drifting down over the centre of Leningrad, and reportedly died later in one of the city's gaols. This marked the start of a long war of attrition for JG 54 as the Soviets threw in more and more aerial reinforcements to defend their second city. In contrast to JG 54's somewhat sedentary existence in the north, the campaign on the southern sector was one of speed and movement as the armoured units of Panzergruppe 1 took full advantage of the wide open expanse of the Ukrainian steppe to outmanoeuvre and encircle whole Russian armies. The two main fighter units supporting operations in the south were JGs 3 and 77. From its jumping-off points south of Warsaw in occupied Poland, JG 3 covered the left-hand flank of the southern front (adjoining the central sector) which was the scene of the main armoured thrust towards the Ukrainian capital Kiev, and thence onwards to the great industrial centre of Kharkov. On their right, JG 77 set out from its fields in Bulgaria and Rumania in support of the ground forces' advances along the shores of the Black Sea towards the Crimea. The most successful fighter pilot during the early months of the air war over southern Russia was the Geschwaderkommodore of JG 3, Major Gunther Lutzow. He alone was responsible for 83 of the Stabsschwarm's 106 victories between June and November 1941, this remarkable string\n\nOberleutnant Hans Philipp, who won JG 54's first Oak Leaves, would be killed in action in defence of the Reich late in 1943 when Kommodore of JG1\n\nAlso pictured wearing the Oak Leaves, awarded on 26 October for 85 victories, II./JG 3's Hauptmann Gordon Gollob subsequently commanded JG 77, before ending the war as the Luftwaffe's third and final General der Jagdflieger\n\nof successes being marked by the award of the Oak Leaves on 20 July (for a total of 42 kills) and the Swords on 11 October (for 92). Exactly a fortnight later a trio of MiG-3s boosted his score to 101. Gunther Lutzow thus became the second member of the Jagdwaffe, after Molders, to achieve the century. He too received an immediate ban on all further operational flying, but this did not stop him from adding two more victories to his overall total - during 'involuntary encounters'(!) with Soviet fighters - before he finally relinquished command of JG 3 in August 1942 to join the staff of the General der Jagdflieger. The Russian reaction along the southern front was similar to that on the central sector. After most of its fighter strength had been destroyed on the ground, the Red Air Force sent in waves of unescorted bombers in an effort to prevent a German break-out. They suffered appalling losses. In expressing his appreciation for the support provided by the Luftwaffe, the Chief of the Army High Command spoke of 'entire Russian bomber Geschwader,flyingwithout fighter cover' being wiped out. This is believed to have been a reference to the action of 8 July when JG 3 claimed the destruction of 38 twin-engined bombers. I. Gruppe was credited with 20 Ilyushin DB-3s, three of which fell to Oberleutnant Robert Olejnik. This brought the number of Olejnik's Russian victims to 25 since claiming the opening kill of Barbarossa. He would achieve halfa-dozen more - and receive the Knight's Cross while so doing- to emerge as I./JG 3's highest scorer before the Gruppe's return to the Reich at the end of September 1941, and subsequent redesignation as II./JG 1. Not too far behind 'Franzl' Lutzow in respect of the number of Soviet aircraft destroyed during this period was Hauptmann Gordon Gollob, Kommandeur of II./JG 3. He had assumed command of the Gruppe on 27 June after the previous incumbent, Hauptmann Lothar Keller, had been killed in a mid-air collision. An ex-Zerstorer pilot, and with six victories already to his credit, Gollob had added 79 Soviet aircraft to his tally by late October. This earned him both the Knight's Cross and the Oak Leaves. In November 1941 II./JG 3 was also withdrawn from the eastern front, but Major Gordon Gollob would reappear in the Soviet Union the following year as Kommodore ofJG 11. Thereafter, he would serve in various staff positions before replacing the 'disgraced' Adolf Galland on 31 January 1945 as the third, and final, General derJagdflieger.\n\nYet another high scorer during the opening phase ofBarbarossawasthe Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 3, Hauptmann Walter Oesau. A veteran of the Condor Legion who had since claimed 42 World War 2 victories to add to the eight Republican machines he had downed in Spain, he was already wearing the Oak Leaves prior to the invasion of Russia. In just five weeks over southern Russia 'Gulle' Oesau was credited with a further 44 enemy aircraft destroyed, his 80th kill of the war - a DB-3 bomber brought down on 15 July - bringing him the Swords to his Knight's Cross. But less than a fortnight later Walter Oesau relinquished command of II./JG 3 to take over as Kommodore of JG 2 in the west. A number of other pilots were also scoring steadily as the ground forces advanced on Kharkov. At least six members of JG 3 were awarded the Knight's Cross during this period, and several of them went on to take their final totals close to the 100 mark. In any other theatre, and in any other air force, an achievement of this kind would be considered outstanding. But such is the dominance of the 'select few' of eastern front aces within much post-war aviation literature that the names of numerical lesser lights such as Franz Beyer, Eberhard von Boremski and Walter Ohlrogge are now all but forgotten. Much the same applies to JG 77, which was operating on JG 3's right flank. By the end of 1941 this Geschwader had a collective total of over 1000 Soviet aircraft destroyed, and five Knight's Crosses had been won as several later high-ranking and highly decorated Experten took their scores into double figures. The two most successful pilots of JG 77 during this period were Oberleutnants Kurt Ubben and Heinrich Setz, with 54 and 52 kills respectively. Both would subsequently be killed in action on the western front, Ubben as Kommodore of JG 2 and Setz as Kommandeur of I./JG 27. Like the Jagdgeschwader to the north, JG 77 also inflicted grievous damage on unescorted Soviet bomber formations. Many multiple successes were achieved. On 25 June Oberleutnant Walter Hoeckner, Staffelkapitan of 6./JG 77, downed eight SB-2s during a Freiejagd sweep. Eighteen of the following day's A7 kills were claimed by just four pilots, with Oberfeldwebel Reinhold Schmetzer, who was credited with five of the 32 SB-2s shot down on this date, then chalking up another five\n\nThis oddly-marked Emil was the mount of Oberleutnant Georg Schirmbock, the Gruppen-TO of ll./JG 77. The symbol behind the chevron, which appears at first glance to be one half of the runic SS insignia, is in fact the emblem of the 'Jungvolk', a youth organisation to which Schirmbock presumably once belonged. He is reported to have adopted this marking after Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann Anton Mader complained that the TO's standard 'Chevron circle' was too similar to his own 'Double chevron'\n\nAs well as being the General der Jagdflieger, Werner Molders also temporarily held the post of Nahkampffuhrer Krim (Closesupport Leader Crimea). And it was no doubt in the latter role that he toured the Stuka units operating over the Crimea in the autumn of 1941. Here, he appears to be making a forceful point to Hauptmann Helmut Bode, Gruppenkommandeur of III./StG 77, while Leutnant Gawlina looks on\n\nBut it was as a fighter tactician that Molders excelled. One lesson he passed on was how to bring down the formidable Stormovik which, at this early stage of the war, was a single-seater machine with no reargunner. The spot to aim at was the unprotected top of the fuel tank immediately behind the cockpit which is precisely where this early II-2 has been hit. A fierce fire has already taken hold as the machine starts to go down\n\nvictories on 10 July. Half of Oberfeldwebel Eugen Wintergerst's 22 kills were also scored on just two days - four SB-2s on 9 August and seven SB-3s three days later. These names may be unfamiliar, but there was one very well-known figure who would see brief action with JG 77 early in November, by which time the Geschwader was operating over the Crimea. In his dual capacity as General der Jagdflieger and temporary Nahkampffuhrer Krim (Closesupport Leader Crimea), Oberst Werner Molders was visiting JG 11 when he heard an NCO pilot complain of a botched attack on an I1-2. Ilyushin's heavily armoured ground-attack Stormovikwasundoubtedly the hardest Soviet aircraft to bring down. Molders took the Oberfeldwebel up the next day to demonstrate his technique; 'He positioned himself off to one side of - and some distance away from - the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. \"Do you see how it's done?\" Oberst Molders voice came over the R/T. \"Right, now you take the next one\". 'I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. \"And again!\" It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!' It was a gesture typical of' 'Vati' Molders. Herbert Kaiser never forgot his 23rd and 24th kills. But because the General der Jagdflieger was officially banned from operational flying, the first Stormovik was never\n\nadded to Molders' list of victories - there has been much speculation as to how many other such 'demonstrations' went unrecorded! Oddly, the one Jagdgeschwader perhaps associated more than any other with the eastern front, and certainly ultimately the most successful of all in terms of numbers of Soviet aircraft destroyed, made the least impact at the beginning of Barbarossa. This was due entirely to the nature of JG 52's deployment. I. Gruppe was not even part of the invading order of battle, but was retained in the west to guard the North Sea coastline. And while Hauptmann Erich Woitke's II. Gruppe performed creditably enough on the central sector (claiming no less than 270 victories during its secondment to JG 27), III./JG 52's kill rate was so poor in comparison to all the other Jagdgruppen involved in the opening stages of the campaign in the east that Hermann Goring was moved to despatch the following telegram to the Gruppenkommandeur on 4 July; 'Your unit continues to distinguish itself by its failure to shoot down the enemy. Just how much longer are the Russians to be allowed into your airspace unhindered? 'Signed - Goring' This was a perfect example of the Reichsmarschall's lack of understanding of the conditions at the front. He now accepted the huge claims of the other Jagdgruppen as the norm, and against these III./JG 52's figures were admittedly low. But Major Albert Blumensaat's unit was the southernmost Gruppe of the entire front. Its task was to patrol the Black Sea coast. Enemy incursions were few, and such raids as were mounted almost invariably approached undetected from across the sea, struck at some coastal or fringe target, and quickly escaped back over open water again. Against hit-and-run tactics of this kind, which could be aimed at any point along a stretch of coastline over 200 miles (320 km) long, it is hardly surprising that the Gruppe's 35+ serviceable fighters fared badly in the scoring stakes. But when III./JG 52 was re-directed inland, its pilots soon began to make up for their slow start.\n\nThis Friedrich belongs to III./JG 52, which was the Gruppe responsible for guarding the Black Sea coastline during the opening phase of Barbarossa. Note the unusual angular '6' and the wavy bar Gruppe symbol, both applied in black to denote 8. Staffel\n\nIll./JG 52's first Knight's Cross was awarded to Feldwebel Gerhard Koppen of 7. Staffel. This early 1942 shot shows the 40th kill, which won Koppen the award, marked in black on a rudder now displaying a total of 62 victories - just ten short of the number which would earn him the Oak Leaves on 27 February. Koppen was posted missing after an engagement with Pe-2s over the Sea of Azov on 5 May. His final score stood at 85\n\nA portent of things to come. The Gruppen-TO of ll./JG 51 (note the Gruppe horizontal bar just visible behind the circle - see colour profile 16) casually brushes the first snow of the winter from the wing of his Friedrich at Vyazma in October 1941\n\nDuring a Stuka-escort mission on 3 August Leutnant Hermann Graf scored the first kill of a career that would transform him into one of the Jagdwaffe's truly outstanding combat leaders. At this time Graf was a member of 9./JG 52. The skies above Kharkov were this Staffel's favourite hunting ground, and before its capture, the town's three main military airfields ensured that there was no lack of aerial opposition. By 11 October 9./JG 52's collective total had risen to 59, making it the most successful of the Gruppe's three Staffeln. The others were not far behind. But on 28 November 8./JG 52 suffered a serious blow when Staffelkapitan Oberleutnant Gunther Rall was seriously wounded after claiming his 36th kill. Temporarily paralysed, it would be nine months before Rail returned to his Staffel. He, too, was destined for great things. Despite being shot down five times, Gunther Rall survived the war as the Luftwaffe's third-highest scoring fighter pilot.\n\nThe winter of 1941-42 quickly tightened its grip. This III. Gruppe machine, and the sentry alongside his tripod-mounted MG 34 machine gun, are fortunate to be well-muffled against the sub-zero temperatures\n\nSoon the snow was so deep that hardstands had to be shovelled free. But there was no respite for the groundcrews, and here a pair of 'black men' refuel a wintercamouflaged lll./JG 53 aircraft from individual drums\n\nYet it was a relatively unknown NCO, 7./JG 52's Feldwebel Gerhard Koppen, who was awarded the Gruppe's first Knight's Cross, for 40 victories, on 18 December. By then, however, Barbarossa was in serious difficulties. The Fuhrer's 'speedy victory' was to be denied him by that one implacable and impartial foe of any invader of Russia's vast open spaces - 'General Winter'. By mid-November autumn's mud had finally given way to snow and ice, and bone-chilling temperatures of-40 degrees descended over the frontlines. Totally unprepared for a winter campaign, and lacking proper clothing and specialised equipment, the Wehrmacht ground to a halt. Taking full advantage of the Germans' immobility, fresh Soviet divisions that had been hastily brought in from Siberia launched a series of counter-attacks. The leading Panzers were soon pushed back from the approaches to Moscow, and German forces retreated and dug in for the winter. The late Werner Molders' fears that the campaign in the east could be a long one had become grim reality.\n\nHangar space was at a premium, and those units lucky enough to be based on ex-Soviet airfields where hangars were still standing made use of every available inch of cover to carry out essential maintenance work\n\nCOLOUR PLATES\n\nÂ« .\n\n1 Bf 109F-2 'White Triple Chevron' of Major Gunther Lutzow, Geschwaderkommodore JG 3, Hostynne, June 1941\n\nBf 109G-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke, Geschwaderkommodore JG 3 'Udet', Morosovskaya, November 1942\n\nBf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Triangle' of Hauptmann Hans von Hahn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 3, Luzk, July 1941\n\nBf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Circle' of Leutnant Detlev Rohwer, Gruppen-TO l./JG 3, Byelaya-Zerkov, August 1941\n\nBf 109F-4 'White Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Kurt Brandle, Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 3 'Udet', Tusow, August 1942\n\nBf 109F-4 'Yellow 7' of Oberleutnant Viktor Bauer, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 3 'Udet', Szolzy, March 1942\n\nBf 109F-4 'Yellow 4' of Oberfeldwebel Eberhard von Boremski, 9./JG 3 'Udet', Zhuguyev, May 1942\n\n34\n\nBf 109F-4 'White Triple Chevron' of Hauptmann Franz Hahn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 4, Mizil/Rumania, January 1943\n\nBf 109E-7 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Gunther Scholz, Gruppenkommandeur lll./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, September 1942\n\n10 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 12' of Oberleutnant Heinrich Ehrler, Staffelkapitan 6./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, March 1943\n\n11 Bf 109G-2 'White 4' of Oberleutnant Theodor Weissenberger, Staffelkapitan 7./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, July 1943\n\nBf 109E-7 'Yellow 1' of Oberleutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 27, Solzy, August 1941\n\n13 Bf 109F-4 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major Karl-Gottfried Nordmann, Geschwaderkommodore JG 51 'Molders', Shatalovka, Summer 1942\n\n14 Bf 109G-6 'White 9' of Leutnant Gunther Josten, l./JG 51 'Molders', Bobruisk, Spring 1944\n\n15 Bf 109F 'Yellow 7' of Oberleutnant Heinrich Krafft, Staffelkapitan 8./JG 51 'Molders', Stolzy, March 1942\n\nBf 109F 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Josef Fozo, Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG 51, Stara-Bychov, July 1941\n\n17 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 5' of Feldwebel Anton Hafner, 6./JG 51 'Molders', Orel-North, August 1942\n\n18 Bf 109F-4 'Red 12' of Oberfeldwebel Heinz Klopper, 11./JG 51 'Molders', Dugino, September 1942\n\nBf 109G-6 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Gerhard Barkhorn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 52, Kharkov-South, August 1943\n\n20 Bf 109G-6 'Red 4' of Oberfeldwebel Rudolf Trenkel, 2./JG 52, Poltava, July 1943\n\nBf 109G-2 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Johannes Steinhoff, Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 52, Rostov, August 1942\n\n22 Bf 109G-6 'White V of Hauptmann Erich Hartmann, Staffelkapitan 4./JG 52, Budaors/Hungary, November 1944\n\n23 Bf 109G-4 'Black 12' of Leutnant Peter Duttmann, 5./JG 52, Anapa, May 1943\n\nBf 109G-2 'Yellow 5' of Leutnant Walter Krupinski, 6./JG 52, Armavir, August 1942\n\n25 Bf 109G-4 'Yellow 3' of Unteroffizier Hans Waldmann, 6./JG 52, Anapa, June 1943\n\nBf 109G-2 'Black 13' of Oberleutnant Gunther Rall, Staffelkapitan 8./JG 52, Gostanovka, August 1942\n\n28 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 11' of Oberleutnant Hermann Graf, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 52, Pitomnik, September 1942\n\n29 Bf 109G-6 'Yellow V of Leutnant Erich Hartmann, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 52, Novo-Zaporozhe, October 1943\n\n30 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major Gunther Freiherr von Maltzahn, Geschwaderkommodore JG 53, Byelaya-Zerkov, July 1941\n\n31 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Circle/Bar' of Leutnant Jurgen Harder, Gruppenstab lll./JG 53, Sobolevo, June 1941\n\nBf 109G-2 'White Chevron and Bars' of Major Hannes Trautloft, Geschwaderkommodore JG 54, Siverskaya, Summer 1942\n\n33 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Hauptmann Hans Philipp, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 54, Siverskaya, March 1942\n\nBf 109F 'Black 8' of Feldwebel Otto Kittel, 2./JG 54, Krasnogvardeisk, May 1942\n\n36 Bf 109E 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Herbert Ihlefeld, Gruppenkommandeur l.(J)/LG 2, Jassy/Rumania, July 1941\n\n41\n\n37 Bf 109F-4 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Anton Mader, Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 77, Stary Oskol, September 1942\n\n38 Bf 109F-4 'Black 5' of Oberleutnant Anton Hackl, Staffelkapitan 5./JG 77, Kastornoje, September 1942\n\n*\n\n42\n\nBf 109F 'White V of Oberleutnant Wolfdieter Huy, Staffelkapitan 7./JG 77, Lunga/Rumania, August 1941\n\nAll drawings on this page are of a Messerschmitt Bf 109G-4, and are to 1/72nd scale\n\nBf 109E-4/B fitted with SD-2 Splitterbomben panniers\n\nBf 109F-4\n\nBf 109G-2\n\nBf 109G-4\n\nBf 109G-6 (early-build)\n\nBf 109G-6 (late-build)\n\nBf 109G-14\n\nCOLOUR PLATES I Bf 109F-2 'White Triple Chevron' of Major Gunther Lutzow, Geschwaderkommodore JG 3, Hostynne, June 1941 One of three Friedrichs available to Gunther Lutzow at the start of Barbarossa, this machine carries prominent early eastern front yellow theatre markings. It also wears Lutzow's preferred style of Kommodore insignia - a triple chevron. Although superficially similar to the aircraft he had flown in France immediately prior to JG 3's transfer eastwards (see Aircraft of the Aces 29, colour profile 11), this is not the same machine, as it displays several minor differences.\n\n2 Bf 109G-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke, Geschwaderkommodore JG 3 'Udet', Morosovskaya, November 1942 Lutzow's successor at the head of JG 3 also enjoyed a Kommodore's perks, for this is one of at least two Gustavs kept at Major Wilcke's disposal during the winter of 1942-43. They wore the more usual style of markings for a Geschwaderkommodore, and featured a much broader aft fuselage yellow theatre band. Note, too, the winged red 'U' unit badge, which was introduced when JG 3 was formally named the Jagdgeschwader ''Udet' on 1 December 1941 following the death of Ernst Udet, the Luftwaffe's Chief of Aircraft Procurement and Supply.\n\none of Rohwer's final tally of 24 Russian kills are carried on the rudder.

The 95 kill bars on the rudder of his Friedrich show that he is already over halfway to achieving that tally, and also offer a clue as to time and place - mid-August 1942 on the road to Stalingrad. Note that in addition to the Geschwader's 'Winged U', Brandle's machine is wearing II.

Note that the slushy conditions have necessitated the removal of the mainwheel leg covers. As was common with lll./JG 3, this machine does not carry the Geschwader badge, but wears in its place the Gruppe's own 'Double-headed axe'.\n\n3 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Triangle' of Hauptmann Hans von Hahn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 3, Luzk, July 1941 A somewhat unusual camouflage scheme and set of Kommandeur's insignia adorned Hans von Hahn's F-2 during the opening weeks of Barbarossa. In addition to the Gruppe's 'Tatzelwurm'emblem on the nose, the machine sported von Hahn's personal badge under the windscreen. Like his namesake, Hans Assi' Hahn of western front fame, von Hahn chose a rooster's head ('Hahn' meaning cockerel in German). Below the cockpit sill on the starboard side was the coat-of-arms of von Hahn's home town, Frankfurt-am-Main. At this stage the rudder scoreboard displays fifteen western kills (plus three balloons) and the first nine of his Soviet victories. He would add ten more to the latter before l./JG 3 left the eastern front to become Il./JG 1.\n\n4 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Circle' of Leutnant Detlev Rohwer, Gruppen-TO l./JG 3, Byelaya-Zerkov, August 1941 The Friedrich of von Hahn's Technical Officer sported an even more distinctive camouflage pattern. Rohwer's machine also retained the yellow nose (with rectangular cut-out for the Gruppe emblem) more associated with the Battle of Britain period. His personal badge was a cartoon rendition of Germany's medieval knight-adventurer Gotz von Berlichingen in a decidedly bawdy pose (depicting Gotz's invitation to his enemies to 'kiss my arse'!). Four western victories and all but\n\n7 Bf 109F-4 'Yellow 4' of Oberfeldwebel Eberhard von Boremski, 9./JG 3 'Udet', Zhuguyev, May 1942 In early spring 1942 lll./JG 3 retired briefly to Germany for re-equipment. Its new aircraft had been destined for the Mediterranean - some even retained tropical filters - and wore that theatre's standard tan and light blue camouflage scheme (see Aircraft of the Aces 2). This was toned down by large segments of dark green and light grey before the Gruppe returned to the east. In addition, every 9. Staffel machine apparently sported the name of its pilot's wife or girl friend below the cockpit. Von Boremski's 'Maxi' (for Maxine?) also displays 43 kills on the rudder. His final eastern front total would reach 84.\n\n8 Bf 109F-4 'White Triple Chevron' of Hauptmann Franz Hahn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 4, Mizil/Rumania, January 1943 Arguably one of the least known fighter units to see service in the east was JG 4. Its I. Gruppe was initially deployed in defence of the Rumanian oilfields, where the opposition was predominantly American. Although the Geschwader produced no outstanding aces, this profile is included not only for the sake of completeness, but also on the strength of its pilot - yet another Hahn! - Franz 'Gockel' ('Rooster') Hahn having already scored some 17+ kills as Staffelkapitan of 11 ./JG 51 (the ex-2./JG 77), prior to assuming command of l./JG 4 in the autumn of 1942. Hahn's choice of command\n\ninsignia (the triple chevron more usually associated with a Geschwaderkommodore - s e e profile 1 for example), may perhaps be explained by the fact that I. Gruppe was still the only component of JG 4 in existence at this time.\n\n9 Bf 109E-7 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Gunther Scholz, Gruppenkommandeur lll./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, September 1942 Spending much of its time astride and above the Arctic Circle, and thus somewhat isolated from the major ground battles along the main fronts, JG 5 nonetheless produced five 100+ Experten. Although Gunther Scholz was not one of them - his score climbing little higher than the 30 depicted here - he did end the war as Kommodore of the Geschwader (while at the same time serving as Jafu Norwegen). Note III. Gruppe's badge (a Lapland fur boat on a Finnish cross) and Scholz's personal emblem - a cute young lady baring the same part of her anatomy as Gotz von Berlichingen!\n\n10 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 12' of Oberleutnant Heinrich Ehrler, Staffelkapitan 6./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, March 1943 Most successful of the Arctic's 'Big Five' was Heinrich Ehrler. References to his final score vary between 201 and 220. To provide a camouflage scheme more suited to the terrain over which it was operating, Ehrier's early Gustav has been given a coat of washable white paint (including the fuselage cross), to which large irregular patches of dark green have been added. Note the 77 Soviet kills that have been carefully recorded on the rudder.\n\n11 Bf 109G-2 'White 4' of Oberleutnant Theodor Weissenberger, Staffelkapitan 7./JG 5, Petsamo/Finland, July 1943 Like Ehrler, Weissenberger also scored over 200 victories, but 'only' 175 of these were claimed in the east. His G-2 is seen here in the same standard grey finish which is hidden by the temporary winter camouflage of 'Yellow 12' (above). His rudder, too, displays a meticulous scoreboard - a Knight's Cross garlanded with oak leaves and surmounted by an eagle to denote his century, plus 12 individual kill bars below. The last five of these were a brace or Airacobras and a trio of Pe-2s all claimed on 25 July 1943. They would bring him the Oak Leaves proper eight days later.\n\n12 Bf 109E-7 'Yellow V of Oberleutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 27, Solzy, August 1941 Although JG 27 did not remain in the east long enough for its pilots to rack up huge scores, several of its members enjoyed considerable success in the opening phases of Barbarossa. One such was Erbo Graf von Kageneck, who claimed 48 Soviet kills between June and October 1941 - 27 of them are recorded here, along with 18 earlier western victories. Note the lack of a III. Gruppe vertical bar, lll./JG 27's unique practice of displaying its aircraft's individual numbers on the engine cowling (a custom introduced during its time as the original l./JG 1) presumably being deemed sufficient for purposes of \\n-Geschwader identification.\n\n13 Bf 109F-4 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major KarlGottfried Nordmann, Geschwaderkommodore JG 51 'Molders', Shatalovka, Summer 1942 Bearing standard finish plus a textbook set of eastern front markings and Kommodore's insignia, this Friedrich is otherwise devoid of any form of unit or personal badge. It is, in fact, the mount of Major Karl-Gottfried Nordmann, who commanded JG 51 from April 1942 to March 1944. Nordmann had added 69 Soviet kills to his earlier tally of nine western victories by the time his involvement in a mid-air collision on 17 January 1943 ended his frontline career.\n\n14 Bf 109G-6 'White 9' of Leutnant Gunther Josten, 1./JG 51 'Molders', Bobruisk, Spring 1944 After having re-equipped with Fw 190s towards the end of 1942, JG 51 converted back on to the Bf 109 early in 1944. Despite being seen here with a ventral bomb-rack, this anonymous Gustav was flown by one of the Geschwader's foremost Experten. For as well as carrying out some 80 fighter-bomber sorties, Gunther Josten claimed 178 aerial victories in the east. This total included more than 60 Stormoviks, plus one Eighth Air Force B-17 (downed on a supply-dropping mission to Warsaw on 18 September 1944).\n\n15 Bf 109F 'Yellow 7' of Oberleutnant Heinrich Krafft, Staffelkapitan 8./JG 51 'Molders', Stolzy, March 1942 This winter-camouflaged Friedrich displays on its rudder the 46 victories (all but four scored in the east) which won the Knight's Cross for its pilot on 18 March 1942. 'Gaudi' Krafft would be promoted to Kommandeur of I. Gruppe on 1 June, and had taken his overall total to 78 before being brought down by Soviet anti-aircraft fire on 14 December 1942.\n\n16 Bf 109F 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Josef Fozo, Gruppenkommandeur of ll./JG 51, Stara-Bychov, July 1941 Austrian-born Fozo had already claimed three I-16s, during his time with the Condor Legion, and 18 western victories before JG 51 was transferred to the east. There, however, two serious injuries - one as Kommandeur of ll./JG 51, and the second when commanding I. Gruppe - severely curtailed his operational career. This Friedrich displays two points of interest. The white silhouette on the first kill bar represents a French observation balloon shot down on 13 March 1940. This profile also shows that ll./JG 51 had by now discontinued its earlier practice of positioning the Gruppe badge on the aft fuselage in lieu of the regulation horizontal bar (see examples in Aircraft of the Aces 11, pages 33 and 58). Although the bar is now in evidence, the Gruppe - still non-conformist - have wedged it between Fozo's Kommandeur chevrons and the fuselage cross.\n\n17 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 5' of Feldwebel Anton Hafner, 6./JG 51 'Molders', Orel-North, August 1942 One of ll./JG 51 's early Gustavs also illustrates the unit's unique custom of wearing its horizontal Gruppe bar ahead of\n\nboth the fuselage cross and the individual aircraft number. Having already gained his first 62 Soviet victories, the pilot of this machine, Feldwebel - later Oberleutnant - Anton Hafner, would emerge as JG 51 's highest scorer with a final total of 204 kills before his own death in action against a Yak-9 over East Prussia on 17 October 1944 when Staffelkapitan of 8./JG 51. It should be borne in mind, however, that part of Hafner's double century had been scored in the Mediterranean, and while flying the Fw 190 upon his return to Russia.\n\n18 Bf 109F-4 'Red 12' of Oberfeldwebel Heinz Klopper, 11./JG 51 'Molders', Dugino, September 1942 Another of JG 51 's highly successful NCO pilots whose aircraft displayed both an unusual Gruppe marking and an impressive scoreboard was 11. Staffel's Heinz Klopper. The 65 kill bars on the rudder earned him the Knight's Cross on 4 September 1942. The smaller, simplified cross behind the fuselage Balkenkreuz was an uncommon, but not unique, method of identifying a IV. Gruppe machine. Klopper would claim a total of 86 Soviet kills before his promotion to Oberleutnant and transfer to the west as Staffelkapitan of 7./JG 1.\n\namassed 148 victories in the east before transferring to the Mediterranean and thence to the Reich. He was seriously burned on 18 April 1945 when his Me 262 crashed on take-off, but survived his injuries to head the post-war German air force.\n\n22 Bf 109G-6 'White 1' of Hauptmann Erich Hartmann, Staffelkapitan 4./JG 52, Budaors/Hungary, November 1944 One pilot who positively advertised his presence in the air was the one known to the Russians as the 'Black Devil of the South'. This is the late model G-6 flown by Erich Hartmann after he relinquished his year-long command of 9. Staffel to set up a new 4./JG 52 in October 1944. Although the machine retains the distinctive black 'tulip-leaf which was Hartmann's individual marking, the 'Karaya' Staffel's famous 'pierced heart' emblem below the cockpit is now a plain red heart bearing the name 'Usch' (for Ursula, whom Hartmann had married two months previously). Note, however, there is no record of Hartmann's current score, which by this time was well above the 300 mark.\n\n23 19 Bf 109G-6 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Gerhard Barkhorn, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 52, Kharkov-South, August 1943 There is little to distinguish this standard, and rather plain, Gustav other than the name below the cockpit. 'Christl' was the wife of Gerhard Barkhorn, the second most successful fighter pilot in the history of aerial warfare. At this stage the Kommandeur of I. Gruppe was already well on the way to his double century. He would survive the war with a staggering final total of 301 kills, all scored on the eastern front.\n\nBf 109G-4 'Black 12' of Leutnant Peter Duttmann, 5./JG 52, Anapa, May 1943 Back to 1943 and anonymity for this earlier Gustav, which was flown over the Kuban bridgehead by the newly-arrived Leutnant Peter Duttmann. In his two years at the front 'Bonifaz' Duttmann was shot down, or was forced to land, no fewer than 19 times. But he gave as good as he got, however, claiming nine kills in one day alone on 7 May 1944. He ended the war as Staffelkapitan of 5./JG 52 with a total of 150 aerial victories (and two tanks destroyed, which were counted as kills in 1945!), plus a further 42 unconfirmed.\n\n20\n\n24\n\nBf 109G-6 'Red 4' of Oberfeldwebel Rudolf Trenkel, 2./JG 52, Poltava, July 1943 One of Barkhom's high-scoring, but relatively little known, NCO pilots was Rudolf Trenkel of 2. Staffel. This Gustav, which Trenkel was flying at the time of Zitadelle, was even more anonymous than the Kommandeur's machine above, and is completely lacking any unit or personal markings. Such caution was not merely a matter of denying intelligence to the enemy. Many pilots were by now wary of disclosing their identities and successes in case they were forced down behind enemy lines. In fact Trenkel would survive unscathed (despite having to bail out five times in one ten-day period), and would end the war as Kapitan of 2./JG 52 with a total of 138 victories.\n\nBf 109G-2 'Yellow 5' of Leutnant Walter Krupinski, 6./JG 52, Armavir, August 1942 Still sporting the now seldom seen 'Winged sword' badge of JG 52 beneath the windscreen, 'Yellow 5' was the mount of Walter 'Graf Punski' Krupinski, who was to be a major influence on the early career of one Erich Hartmann. After a year serving as Staffelkapitan of 7./JG 52, Krupinski himself was transferred to the west where he commanded, in turn, 1 ./JG 5, II./JG 11 and lll./JG 26, before ending the war flying Me 262s with JV 44. His eastern front victories totalled 177.\n\n21 Bf 109G-2 'Black Double Chevron' of Hauptmann Johannes Steinhoff, Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 52, Rostov, August 1942 Although giving nothing away intelligence-wise, 'Macki' Steinhoff's G-2 presents a more interesting appearance with its three-colour spinner, densely dappled engine cowling and obvious signs of overpainting on its rear fuselage. Another of JG 52's solid core of 100+ Experten, Johannes Steinhoff\n\n25 Bf 109G-4 'Yellow 3' of Unteroffizier Hans Waldmann, 6./JG 52, Anapa, June 1943 Another of JG 52's successful young NCOs, 'Dackel' Waldmann had already scored 53 kills in the nine months up to June 1943. By the end of May 1944 his final eastern front total had reached 125. He, too, transferred to the west and later converted on to the Me 262, but was killed in a mid-air collision in the closing weeks of the war when serving as Staffelkapitan of 3./JG 7. This particular G-4 is apparently a new delivery, hence the areas of fresh paint covering the four-letter code applied at the factory. Note also the small dimensions of the individual aircraft number common to the\n\nGruppe's aircraft at this period. The personal emblem is a play on the pilot's nickname, 'Waldmann' ('Woodsman') also being a favourite name for a pet Dackel, or dachshund.\n\n26 Bf 109G-6 'Yellow 3' of Leutnant Heinz Ewald, 6./JG 52, Zilistea/Rumania, June 1944 Reflecting ll./JG 52's brief period of service in the specialised anti-bomber role defending the Rumanian oilfields against high-flying US 'heavies', this G-6 'Kanonenboot'(Gunboat) is equipped with 20 mm underwing cannon gondolas and sports a spiral spinner (widely believed to throw off the aim of the enemy bombers' gunners). It also bears another word-play personal emblem, Heinz Ewald's nickname being 'Esau' ('E-sow'). Like Waldmann, Ewald also flew many missions as Barkhorn's wingman before he assumed command of 7./JG 52 in February 1945. His score at the war's end stood at 84.\n\n27 Bf 109G-2 'Black 13' of Oberleutnant Gunther Rall, Staffelkapitan 8./JG 52, Gostanovka, August 1942 The third of JG 52's triumvirate of top scorers, Oberleutnant Gunther Rall flew this 'Black 13' upon his return to the command of 8. Staffel on 28 August 1942, exactly nine months to the day after being severely wounded the previous November. At that time he had claimed just 36 kills. He would add 235 more Soviet victories to his score (latterly as Kommandeur of I ll./JG 52) before his transfer to the west in the spring of 1944. Note III. Gruppe's 'Barbed cross' badge forward of the windshield, and wavy bar symbol on the aft fuselage.\n\n30 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Major Gunther Freiherr von Maltzahn, Geschwaderkommodore JG 53, Byelaya-Zerkov, July 1941 Although not a high scorer himself, 'Henri' von Maltzahn was one of the Jagdwaffe's true leaders (a quality recognised by the award of the Knight's Cross back in December 1940, when his personal score stood at just 13 - a far cry from Hartmann's 148!). Here, the tail of his Friedrich displays all 20 of his western victories to date, plus the additional 22 Soviet kills which won him the Oak Leaves on 24 July 1941. He would end his three years as Kommodore of JG 53 with a final tally of 68 victories - 35 in the west and 33 in the east.\n\n31 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Circle/Bar' of Leutnant Jurgen Harder, Gruppenstab lll./JG 53, Sobolevo, June 1941 Bearing a single kill bar on the rudder for his first Soviet victim (an 'I-17' claimed on the opening day of Barbarossa), Harder's F-2 also displays a heavily dappled cowling - the result of heavy-handed overspraying of the earlier Channel front yellow - and an unusual Gruppenstab symbol. It has been suggested that the latter denotes the combined duties of an adjutant and TO. One of three fighter-pilot brothers, none of whom would survive the war, the name below the cockpit commemorates the first brother to be killed in action - Hauptmann Harro Harder, Gruppenkommandeur of lll./JG 53, who was shot down off the Isle of Wight on 12 August 1940. As Kommodore of JG 11, Jurgen Harder would lose his life in a crash near Berlin early in 1945. His final score of 64 included 17 eastern front victories.\n\n28 Bf 109G-2 'Yellow 11' of Oberleutnant Hermann Graf, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 52, Pitomnik, September 1942 The same Gruppe badge adorns the Gustav of fellowStaffelkapitan Hermann Graf. But this machine also carries 9./JG 52's famous 'Pierced heart' emblem, albeit without the word 'Karaya' - the Staffers equally celebrated radio call-sign - beneath it. As with most of the 'Karaya' Staffers machines, the red heart has a girl's name (Elli?)superimposed on it in tiny white letters. Graf reportedly scored his 150th kill in this aircraft on 4 September. After service in the west (where he claimed ten US 'heavies') Graf returned to JG 52 in October 1944; this time as Kommodore-a position he held until the end. His final tally of Soviet kills numbered 202.\n\n29 Bf 109G-6 'Yellow V of Leutnant Erich Hartmann, Staffelkapitan 9./JG 52, Novo-Zaporozhe, October 1943 The mount of the 'Karaya' Staffel's most famous Kapitan, Leutnant - later Oberleutnant - Erich Hartmann. The century motif and additional 21 individual victory bars date this as 2 October 1943 (on this day Hartmann claimed four kills - a brace of La-5s, a Pe-2 and an Airacobra). But he was still 27 victories - and 27 days - away from winning the Knight's Cross! Note that the distinctive 'tulip-leaf nose decoration has yet to put in an appearance, as has the name Ursel'- for fiancee Ursula Paetsch - which would grace the pierced heart. For some reason the inscription worn on the Staffel emblem at this time reportedly read 'Dicker Max' ('Fat Max')!\n\n32 Bf 109G-2 'White Chevron and Bars' of Major Hannes Trautloft, Geschwaderkommodore JG 54, Siverskaya, Summer 1942 Another celebrated fighter leader who put the welfare and success of his Geschwader before personal ambition, Hannes Trautloft's eastern front score of 45 was modest by some standards, but his contribution to JG 54 was incalculable. He flew at least three machines similarly (but not identically) marked to the example depicted here. All wore a non-standard segmented camouflage (of two-tone green, or tan and green) which accentuated the white Kommodore's insignia. Note, also, that the famous 'Green Heart' Geschwader badge features the crests of JG 54's three component Gruppen in miniature.\n\n33 Bf 109F-2 'Black Chevron and Bars' of Hauptmann Hans Philipp, Gruppenkommandeur l./JG 54, Siverskaya, March 1942 Despite its Major beim Stab insignia, this rather worn wintercamouflaged Friedrich is the machine flown by Hans Philipp, Kommandeur of I. Gruppe, as he neared his century in the early months of 1942. He would be the fourth member of the Jagdwaffe to reach the 100 mark (on 31 March 1942), and the second to achieve the double century (behind Hermann Graf) a little less than a year later on 17 March 1943. He transferred to the west as Kommodore of JG 1 shortly thereafter, only to\n\nbe killed in action against P-47s in October 1943. All but 29 of his 206 victories had been claimed in Russia.\n\n34 Bf 109F 'White 8' of Leutnant Walter Nowotny, 1./JG 54, Ryelbitzi, Summer 1942 Also sporting the Geschwader's 'Green Heart' and the badge of I. Gruppe, 'White 8' was flown by 1. Staffel's Walter Nowotny. Although more properly associated with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (see Osprey Aircraft of the Aces 6 - Fw 190 Aces of the Russian Front), Nowotny's first half-century and more were scored on Bf 109s. The rudder of this Friedrich shows that he is already well on the way to his Knight's Cross, awarded on 4 September for 56 kills. Altogether, his final eastern front tally would be 255. Note, incidentally, that the green heart emblem has been embellished with Nowotny's personal 'lucky 13'.\n\n35 Bf 109F 'Black 8' of Feldwebel Otto Kittel, 2./JG 54, Krasnogvardeisk, May 1942 Very similar to the aircr"
