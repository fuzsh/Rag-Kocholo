        "text": "Radioman Second Class Francis Cinque was assigned to the Auk-class minesweeper USS Broadbill (AM 58) during World War Two. He participated in Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Allied landings at Normandy, the bombardment of the Port of Cherbourg, and Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. I recently had the privilege of helping his grandson’s family identify some of the pictures from his album, and they agreed to allow me to share a few of them here.\n\nThis set was taken by RM2 Cinque as he walked through the port of Marseille, France. Marseille was liberated from the Germans by French forces under the command of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny on 28AUG44. The retreating Germans had destroyed much of the port in an effort to deny its use to the Allied armies fighting in Southern France.\n\nI have identified Mr. Cinque’s photographs to the best of my abilities, and added contemporary photographs where they are useful. If anyone has any additional information or can correct any errors I may have made please add your information in the comments below and I’ll pass them along to the family.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nPublished by Jeff Groves\n\nScale Modeling and Military History View all posts by Jeff Groves\n\nPublished"
