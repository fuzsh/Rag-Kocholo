Collections of modern architecture models are faced with a whole set of new conservation issues. They present material challenges akin to those of modern sculpture. The session seeks to focus specifically on issues of model conservation seen from any combination of historical, material, and philosophical points of view.\n\nChairs: Barry Bergdoll, Corinne Bélier\n\n12:00 – 13:00\n\n“The Architectural Model – Tool, Fetish, Small Utopia”\n\nGuided tour of the architecture model exhibition at DAM\n\n13:00 – 14:00\n\nLunch\n\n14:00 – 15:00\n\nshort lectures (Pecha Kucha format)\n\nVarious architectural collections in Germany\n\n15:30 – 17:30\n\ntour 2_ museumsufer\n\nGuided tour by foot to the surrounding district of the DAM along the river Main to the museums in the neighbourhood (Städel, addition Schneider+Schumacher, 2008-12 / Museum für Angewandte Kunst, Richard Meier, 1982-85 / etc.), to the St. Bonifatius church, and to the archives of the DAM.\n\nFree evening\n\nTuesday, September 4, 2012\n\nI.G.-Farben Building, Campus Westend and Commerzbank Tower\n\nTransfers by subway\n\nCampus Westend\n\nGrüneburgplatz 1\n\n09:00 – 10:00\n\ntour 3_ I.G.-Farben Building and Campus Westend\n\nGuided tour by foot of the former I.G.-Farben Headquarters (by Hans Poelzig 1928-1931) and the new university campus. After 1945 Poelzig’s buildings served as the headquarters of the US Army V. Corps. Following the departure of the Americans in the 1990s the university took over the historical site. A first construction stage between 2001 and 2008 saw the emergence of the Campus Westend with several new buildings (by Ferdinand Heide, Kleihues + Kleihues et al.).\n\n10:30 – 12:30\n\nsession 2_ reconstruction\n\nThe session questions the framework laid down in the 1964 Venice Charter for dealing with historical building fabric, which to large extent made reconstruction a taboo, calling for a distinct difference between old and new. The session also aims to reflect on Modernist ideas as reflected in the interpretation and significance of reconstruction in other cultures.\n\nChair: Winfried Nerdinger\n\n12:30 – 13:30\n\nLunch\n\nTransfer by subway to the CBD of Frankfurt\n\nCommerzbank Tower\n\nKaiserplatz\n\nSession and reception in the high-rise (1994-1997, by Norman Foster and Partners), visit of the winter gardens.\n\n14:30 – 16:30\n\nsession 3_ strategies (roundtable discussion)\n\nToday, global ecological and financial crises, in addition to increasingly digital environments, create the necessity to rethink the architecture museum as an institution. The session will center on understanding these new conditions and reflect on the current cultural position and the strategies needed for the architecture museum to maintain an effective critical role.\n\nChairs: Dietmar Steiner, Mirko Zardini\n\n17:00 – 18:00\n\nFarewell Frankfurt, reception high above the city\n\nFree evening\n\nWednesday, September 5, 2012\n\nNORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA (NRW)\n\nM:AI Museum für Architektur und Ingenieurkunst NRW\n\nCologne and Museumsinsel Hombroich\n\nTransfer to Cologne by train ICE arriving at 09:15\n\n09:30 – 12:30\n\ntour 4_ Cologne\n\nGuided Tour by bus to House Ungers, UAA, Cologne and to the interim location of the collapsed Historical City Archive of Cologne\n\n12:30 – 13:30\n\nLunch at the Triangle Tower\n\nBus transfer to the “Museumsinsel Hombroich” and the nearby former NATO missile base.

They are also indisputably liabilities: the cost of processing, storing, and making these assets available in both physical and digital form leads some institutions to re-think the entire endeavor of collecting at a moment when archives themselves are plentiful but resources are scarce.\n\nChair: Irena Murray\n\n18:30 – 20:30\n\n“Dinner on an island”\n\n21:30\n\nBy bus to the Hotels in Essen (arrival time 21:30)\n\nThursday, September 6, 2012\n\nEssen and Gelsenkirchen\n\n08:15\n\nMeeting point Essen City\n\nBy bus to the MiR Musiktheater im Revier, Gelsenkirchen\n\nThe 1959 opened Building based on plans by Werner Ruhnau. “An open society needs open theatre play forms“, says the architect. Ruhnau has realised the theatre in a creative dialogue between architecture, art and technology. Different disciplines opening themselves towards another, their interplay Ruhnau kept initialising over and over again, that’s how this holistic artwork has evolved, an artwork many artists like Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Norbert Kricke have participated in at the end of the 1950s.\n\n09:30 – 10:30\n\nGuided tour with the architect Werner Ruhnau\n\n10:30 – 12:30\n\nMiR Small House\n\nsession 5_ Is there anybody out there? (Audience & Education)\n\nWhat do curators and designers of architecture exhibitions actually know about their audience? What do they look like today, the visitors of architectural museums and exhibitions? The session deals with these questions. Especially the user’s perspective shall be focused on. The presentation of new didactic activities will also be part of the session.\n\nChair: Rebecca Bailey\n\nBy bus to world heritage site Zollverein, Essen\n\nZollverein was once considered the most up-to-date and most beautiful coal mine of worldwide. Its architecture once set trends towards purpose-orientated industrial buildings. After being closed down in 1986, Zollverein became a symbol for the structural change of the Ruhr region. Rem Koolhaas, Foster & Partners, SANAA architects and agence-ter where involved in the development of the project Zollverein.\n\n13:00\n\nreception on the cooking plant Zollverein\n\n14:30 – 16:30\n\ngeneral assembly at the coal washery, Zollverein XII\n\nTime for guided tours\n\nalternative I\n\nZollverein area with architecture of Sanaa office, Norman Foster, Rem Koolhaas, agence-ter\n\nalternative II\n\nTransfer to Folkwang Museum, David Chipperfield\n\nBack to the hotels\n\n19:30\n\nMeeting point Essen City\n\nTransfer to Coalmine Oberschuir, Gelsenkirchen\n\nThe building gets erected as “shaft 8” of the Gelsenkirchen coal mine “Consolidation” for man-riding and ventilation until it was closed 1981\n\n20:30 – open end\n\ndinner at a coal mine\n\nBus shuttles to the hotels\n\nBeginning at 22:00\n\nFriday, September 7, 2012\n\nEssen – Berlin\n\nTransfer to the main railway station, Essen\n\nBy train to the post-conference tour, Berlin\n\nShuttles to the Airport Düsseldorf\n\nPre conference tour:\n\nA guided bus tour to discover the surrounding region of Frankfurt. It takes in famous villas in Kronberg and Königstein, passes the Taunus hills and the Rheingau region. One main stop will be the former Administration Building of Farbwerke Hoechst which is an outstanding example of expressionist architecture.\n\n14:00\n\nDeparture by bus from the DAM\n\n14:20 – 15:30\n\nPeter Behrens Building, former Administration Building Farbwerke Hoechst, Frankfurt-Hoechst, 1920-1925, by Peter Behrens\n\n16:00 – 18:00\n\nRang House, Königstein, 1960-1964, by Richard Neutra\n\nVilla Gans, Kronberg, 1929-1931, by Peter Behrens\n\n18:00 – 18:30\n\nBreak at a viewpoint, sundowner\n\n19:00\n\nBus back to the DAM\n\nPost conference tour:\n\nBerlin and Brandenburg\n\nFriday, September 7 – Tuesday September 11, 2012\n\nBerlin, a changing city\n\nFriday, September 7, 2012\n\nThe five-day post-conference tour begins with a train journey from Essen to the main station in Berlin, a new glass building designed by the architects at von Gerkan, Marg und Partner. After checking in, the tour proceeds to the government district with its new buildings by Foster, Schultes, Braunfels and many others. Over the past 22 years Berlin has mutated into a unified city, a development which was accompanied by dynamic euphoria. When the Wall came down in 1989 urban development decisions were made under enormous time pressure, and the damage left behind in the city by the War, the post-War years, and the building of the Wall, had to be treated. Since 1990 some 450 constructional and urban development competitions have been staged and implemented in the new capital, not to mention innumerable new buildings initiated by private investors from all over the world.\n\nSaturday, September 8, 2012\n\nThe second day of the post-conference tour takes in Potsdam, with its parks and Sanssouci Palace, Landgut Bornstedt, and Erich Mendelsohn’s Einstein Tower.\n\nSunday, September 9 through Monday, September 10, 2012\n\nOn the third and fourth days we will be devoting ourselves to the city’s architectural highlights. Stretching along the River Spree in east Berlin, Museum Island boasts 19th century buildings by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Friedrich August Stüler, and Ernst von Ihne, and is a World Heritage site. The urban expansion of the early 20th century was dominated by the construction of housing estates and classical Modernism. Architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Hans Poelzig, Hans Scharoun, Otto Bartning, Emil Fahrenkamp, Hugo Häring, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Paul Mebes, not to mention the brothers Bruno and Max Taut and Hans and Wassili Luckhardt played a major role in the development of modern architectural history. The legacy of the 1930s has all but disappeared from the Berlin cityscape. The former Reichssportfeld, on which the Olympic Stadium stands, has been put to modern use.\n\nThe Second World War left behind an enormous amount of destruction in Berlin. In the divided city two forms of architecture emerged that could scarcely have been more different, represented by the Hansaviertel in the west and Stalinallee in the east. Even though it is nowadays difficult to trace the course the Wall took in the city, the buildings by architects such as Hans Scharoun, Werner Düttmann, Paul Baumgarten, Egon Eiermann in what was West Berlin and by the architects Hermann Henselmann, Richard Paulick, Kurt Liebknecht, Heinz Graffunder, Josef Kaiser in the former East Berlin still convey the ruling political ideologies of the time. The Brecht-Weigel building will provide us with an exclusive insight into Berthold Brecht’s archive, and the Bauhaus Archive will open its collections exclusively for us.\n\nTuesday September 11, 2012\n\nThe final day will also be devoted to monuments in the center of Berlin, such as the Dutch Embassy design by Rem Koolhaas and Pariser Platz, with buildings by, among others, Frank O. Gehry and Günter Behnisch. The post-conference tour will come to an end with a view of Brandenburg Gate from the balcony of the Akademie der Künste.\n\nContact: Eva-Maria Barkhofen, Akademie der Künste, Baukunstarchiv, Berlin, Barkhofen@adk.de\n\nplease note: the tour is limited to 30 people and will take place"
