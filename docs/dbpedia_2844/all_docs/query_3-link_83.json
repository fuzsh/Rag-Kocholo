        "text": "Nick Brown didn’t really played sports as a kid.\n\nInstead, the current Hopkinton High senior spent most of his time acting.\n\n“Acting was kind of my life,” Brown, 17, said.\n\nDuring his freshman year at Hopkinton, Brown joined the indoor track team as a sprinter. He was the slowest kid on the team.\n\nHe didn’t particularly care for running.\n\n“It wasn’t really my thing,” Brown said. “I couldn’t wait until it was over.”\n\n“I remember he would come in last for every single sprint race,” said Nick’s brother, Alex, a freshman distance runner at Boston University and former Hopkinton standout. “The last race of the year, he came in second to last. We celebrated and picked him up. It was pretty funny.”\n\nThat year, Nick Brown tried balancing theater with running. He saw the latter as less of a time commitment.\n\nBy his sophomore year, Brown’s older brother and mother convinced him to re-join the indoor track team. This time he decided to take his shot at distance running.\n\n“I knew he was a theater kid and didn’t want to press him too much about joining,” Nick’s brother said. “Personally, I think it was mostly his decision, but I may have pushed him a bit to stick with distance and keep at it.”\n\n“It was really so different from anything I’d done before since I wasn’t a big sports guy,” Brown said. “It took me out of my comfort zone. The competitive aspect gave me a whole new part of my life that I really started to cherish.”\n\nThat was when Brown began to hit his stride. He realized that distance running is what made him the most happy. Brown proceeded to quit theater and devote more time to improving his gait.\n\nThat decision paid off as Brown was named Tri-Valley League pod MVP during the “Fall I” season. He ran in four of five races this fall, finishing first in all of those races.\n\nAdditionally, he also competed at the MSTCA Cup in Attleboro on Nov. 21 and finished 16th out of 244 runners in a 5K (3.1 miles) personal best time of 16 minutes, 35 seconds.\n\n“It’s really cool, but a lot of those races, I wasn’t really running the times I wanted,” said Nick, who eats toast with peanut butter and drinks a Gatorade before every race. “I didn’t really have anyone to push me. I have a hard time pushing myself without lots of competition.”\n\n“What impresses me most about him is how hard he works,” first-year Hopkinton boys cross country coach Laura McKenzie said. “He’s got a lot of ability. I’m not sure he knows how good he can be. He just really needs to race more and be pushed.”\n\nBrown’s training regimen picked up initially during the summer between his sophomore and junior years. It was then that Brown began running four days a week for roughly three to four miles.\n\n“Doing that by himself, I could tell he was going to be a really good runner,” his brother said.\n\nOnce cross country season came around his junior year, Brown ramped up the training. Instead of running four days a week, he began to run at least six days, consistently. And the miles started to pick up as well, as that was the first time he did runs for more than 10 miles.\n\nBrown credits his older brother for his newfound passion of running.\n\n“I don’t think I would have started running if it wasn’t for him,” Brown said. “I never really expected to be as fast as him – he’s crazy fast – but he gave me something to work for.\n\n“I remember he paced me in the 2-mile at the TVL indoor meet that year. I broke 10 minutes and we finished within a couple seconds of each other. That was the best race I’ve ran. It was great to experience that.”\n\nDuring important races, Brown sports a white and red headband with the Polish flag on it. He picked it up at a running expo in Boston. It was one of the only flags that they had left, so he went with it.\n\n“It’s become my lucky headband,” he said.\n\nIt’s a headband you’ll find Brown wearing when he competes in college. On Dec. 12, Brown committed to run at Bates College. Not bad for a kid who was the slowest runner on his team just four years ago.\n\n“I knew I’d get the best of both worlds academically and athletically,” he said. “I just wanted to go to a school that suited my interests and would challenge me. I think Bates will do that.”"
