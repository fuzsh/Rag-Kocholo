This University-wide ceremony, where Syracuse University Chancellor and President Kent Syverud will formally confer degrees, is for all undergraduate, graduate and doctoral candidates. Doors open at 8 a.m.\n\nFollowing Commencement, all 2020 Newhouse graduates and their families are invited to join Dean Mark J. Lodato and the faculty and staff for a celebratory reception. The event will include a dean’s welcome, recognition of participating graduates and an opportunity to reconnect with faculty. A precise time and location will be announced soon; stay tuned for details.\n\nFor more information about Commencement activities for the Class of 2020, see the event listing.\n\nSuccess Through Syracuse\n\nAlumna Amanda Quick shares how her journey of opportunity and connection led to a dynamic career.\n\nWhen Amanda Quick ’14, G’16 enrolled in Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, she intended to follow the trail blazed by renowned broadcasters like Dick Clark ’51, Bob Costas ’74 and Mike Tirico ’88—and she had a four-year plan mapped to help her achieve that goal. But just a few weeks into her first semester, Quick attended the Involvement Fair—where students learn about student organizations and other opportunities on campus—and found herself drawn to a range of activities that were not part of her plan. “I realized there was so much available to me at Syracuse University—so many things I wanted to participate in—I decided to be flexible and open to opportunity.”\n\nSpontaneous commitment to the Division I women’s rowing team is just one of many opportunities Quick embraced during her time at Syracuse. She also added minors in marketing and Chinese studies, interned at the Olympics in London, studied abroad in Hong Kong, traveled the country to interview young entrepreneurs and earned a master’s degree in a new field. Ultimately, Quick’s Syracuse experiences helped her launch a rewarding career working for Fortune 500 companies—a professional trajectory she could not have imagined when she first stepped on campus, but one that perfectly reflects the balance she found between being open to new experiences and ideas and keeping true to her core motivations.\n\nReflecting on all she learned in the process, Quick, who was recently celebrated with the Generation Orange Award and induction onto the board of Newhouse Emerging Leaders, shared some of the valuable takeaways.\n\nTake Advantage of Professional Opportunity Through Alumni Connection\n\nFrom the start, Quick—a broadcast and digital journalism major—sought to gain professional experiences. She joined a student-run radio station as DJ and business development director and participated in multiple internships.\n\nQuick first experienced the supportive community of the Orange network during her internships. She relished interning with BrandYourself, a reputation management company founded by three Syracuse alumni (and which later appeared on ABC’s Shark Tank). Her connection with Syracuse also helped her secure three summer internships with NBC Sports, where she worked with alumni who ensured she had diverse and meaningful experiences. “This is really where the Syracuse connections come in. The Newhouse alumni I met made sure I had extraordinary access. I got to sit on set, meet the talent—it was amazing,” she says.\n\nFocus on What You Love Doing More Than Job Titles\n\nQuick’s professional experiences helped her clarify and refine her goals. “At first, I was focused on becoming a reporter and anchor. But I came to understand that at the core, my passion is storytelling. When I focused on that, rather than a particular job title, I found so many creative ways to tell stories,” she explains.\n\nOne of the projects Quick found most meaningful entailed research on college-aged entrepreneurs. “I was awarded funding through the Renée Crown University Honors Program and traveled to universities across the country to meet incredible students who were building companies and startups right from their dorm rooms,” she says. “The project also allowed me to tap into new mediums and platforms in exciting ways. I was telling stories, but not from an anchor desk.”\n\nWhat’s Next at Newhouse\n\nThe Newhouse School today stands as one of the most well-regarded schools of communications in the country, with programs that represent all areas of the industry. Its roots at Syracuse University stretch back more than 100 years, to the founding of the Department of Journalism in 1919. And those roots are still strong.\n\n“At the end of the day, journalism remains the heartbeat of the Newhouse School,” says Dean Mark J. Lodato. “Journalism is where we serve our most important purpose, as it is critical to our democracy.”\n\nThat sense of purpose underpins the school’s new academic strategic plan, created last fall as part of a campuswide strategic planning process launched by Vice Chancellor, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Gretchen Ritter that resulted in individual plans for each school and college as well as a University plan, “Leading With Distinction.”\n\nSome 300 faculty, staff, students and alumni worked on the Newhouse plan, a comprehensive document that outlines a dynamic vision for the school’s future and charts a course for the next five years.\n\nHere, Lodato discusses highlights of the plan and opportunities for the school moving forward.\n\nDefending the role of journalism in our democracy has become increasingly critical. What part will the Newhouse School play in that effort?\n\nI expect to see robust growth in our impact over the next five years. With the establishment of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC), a joint effort with the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, we are working toward a return to civil discourse and underscoring the importance of journalism in our democracy. The institute allows for cross-college collaboration and industry partnerships. Together with NBC News, IDJC is staging a series of focus groups to gain insights from key voting blocs in 2024 presidential election battleground states. The institute has also received a $250,000 grant to look at misinformation in the presidential election, which will involve IDJC researchers working with Senior Associate Dean Jennifer Stromer-Galley from the School of Information Studies, who is an expert in this area. All these things bring immense value to our country and our society.\n\nThe concept of engaged citizenship is an important tenet of the University plan, and IDJC obviously plays into that. In what other ways does engaged citizenship resonate for Newhouse?\n\nWe are producing students who want to engage. We are producing storytellers and journalists, advocates and persuasive communicators. We are keeping our communities informed, we are entertaining our communities and, as journalists, we’re taking responsibility for the future of our communities. We are also applying for grants that will help support local news and looking at how the school can work with media outlets or local organizations—especially in rural areas—to keep communities informed. An example of how this can work is the reporting and writing our students do to help [public radio station] WAER cover Central New York. Our students are also working with professional journalists from the USA Today Network and Central Current as part of a reporting team investigating the impact of police vehicle crashes on communities throughout New York state. That project is led by faculty members Jodi Upton and Nausheen Husain.\n\nTalk about ‘digital citizenship,’ a key phrase in Newhouse’s academic strategic plan.\n\nOne major focus for the school is the connectivity between communications and technology. For years, we have enjoyed tremendous success and rich relationships with legacy media, and we need to continue that. But to truly lead in the future, we need to train our students around technology and communications. So that’s companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Netflix, and it is technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nWe must ensure that our students can succeed in a rapidly changing communications environment. But that includes training and educating them to be good stewards of this technology. When we talk about digital citizenship, we’re talking about what it means to use technology responsibly if you’re a content creator, and also what it means to use technology in a responsible way if you’re a consumer. Newhouse can play a role in both those areas. We’re educating students, but we can also educate news consumers. It is a real opportunity for us.\n\nHow will the school embrace that opportunity?\n\nWhat we envision is what we are currently calling the Advanced Media Lab. I see it as a hub, ensuring that our departments and faculty use technology—the latest, greatest technology—in the most effective way within our curriculum. It can also be a conduit to external partners and resources. In three years, I would love to see a large company send their employees to us for training in artificial intelligence or corporate communications strategy, for example. It would be educational but would also provide avenues for collaboration with these amazing organizations when they bring their people to campus. We’re currently hiring a new faculty member to be part of this exciting effort and talking to companies about engaging with us at a high level.\n\nWhat are some other areas of opportunity for the Newhouse School?\n\nOur study away programs in Los Angeles and New York City are already strong, and we will continue to expand those while also working to grow our newer program in Washington, D.C. We are raising money to help reduce barriers to access so that 100% of students can take advantage of the opportunity to spend a semester in one of those cities or abroad. We’ll offer more Newhouse DEIA courses at study abroad locations, including a class in Santiago, Chile, that examines diversity in Chilean film, or a course in Madrid that addresses stereotypes in Spanish advertising.\n\nNewhouse is a leader, if not the leader, when it comes to experiential learning. Look at what our students have the opportunity to do, whether in Syracuse or off campus—reporting on Capitol Hill, producing content in New York City or Los Angeles. Few schools can rival that.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe Newhouse Academic Strategic Plan will guide the school’s core mission of providing a top-of-class educational experience focused on preparing graduates for a communications career. The Newhouse School will foster the next generation of alumni and support the faculty and staff so instrumental in helping our students succeed.\n\nWhile the plan sets 2028 as the target to reach goals, this blueprint will provide a foundation for Newhouse into the next decade and beyond.\n\nTop commitments\n\nGrow programs and student experiences, as well as faculty research and creative activities, that focus on the intersection of democracy, journalism and citizenship.\n\nInvest in faculty projects, curriculum development and infrastructure that promote principles of inclusion and equity for students in every Newhouse communications discipline.\n\nExpand industry partnerships and collaborations to create unmatched opportunities to pursue research and creative activities for students and faculty.\n\nDevelop student excellence and advance faculty expertise in technology-driven communication tools and practices, specifically in advanced and emerging media.\n\nEmerge as a global hub for sports media and communications and the study of sports media through teaching, research and creative and professional activities.\n\nTimeline\n\nFall 2022\n\nDean Mark J. Lodato appoints a Strategic Planning Committee composed of faculty, staff and students to oversee the strategic planning process.\n\nFall 2022 semester\n\nCommittee hosts 13 listening sessions to gather input from all segments of the Newhouse community.\n\nOctober 2022-April 2023\n\nCommittee works on the strategic plan in conjunction with Dean Lodato and school leaders.\n\nMay 2023\n\nThe strategic plan is formally submitted to the University Provost’s Office.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nImplementation of strategic plan begins, establishing benchmarks through 2028.\n\nAdapting to AI\n\nNewhouse faculty members are immersed in study and research across a host of topics that investigate how artificial intelligence touches our lives, from the challenges of rooting out fake news to the opportunities and risks that come with the integration of AI and extended reality. Here, they share insights into how AI is affecting their respective fields.\n\nThe integration of AI and extended reality (XR) offers incredible opportunities for creativity and heightened immersion, but also increases the risks of misinformation and privacy violations. XR technologies collect individualized information about users’ body motions. Generative AI can incorporate that information to create personalized interactive experiences that enhance the experiences of XR users. This has great potential for education, job-training, therapy, entertainment and gameplay. However, this data could also be used to manipulate and mislead through tailored persuasive techniques and interactions with personalized virtual avatars.\n\nAI forces the dwindling local news industry to answer a difficult question: Is AI-generated local news better than nothing? If we want AI to be a civically useful part of local news’ future, local governments need to provide transparent civic information that will train and supply AI “journalism.” One part of my research into new models of nonprofit news asks whether we can use the efforts of these new sites to create informative, equitably focused civic products (including meeting notes, how-to guides and policy analyses) that could be scaled and delivered to broader audiences using AI.\n\nWhile the challenges of fake news and misinformation are not new, the speed, scale and global impact created by digital media channels certainly are. The application of generative AI systems capable of creating completely synthetic text, images, audio and video has the potential to disrupt this dynamic and even further erode public trust. To meet this challenge, our research has had to move beyond a focus on development and evaluation of new digital detection tools and start working with these AI systems directly. By pushing AI generative capabilities to the limit, we can help shape digital literacy and ethical frameworks.\n\nThe integration of AI into mass communication classrooms has effects that will reverberate for years to come. Proper utilization and integration of AI-driven tools are key to the future of our industry. For instance, PR professionals rely on data analysis powered by AI to make data-driven decisions, a stark change from traditional roles in the field. However, rushing to incorporate AI without being aware of its vast potential and limitations can lead to unintended results. The value of artificial intelligence to professionals and rapid proliferation in strategic communication make it an indispensable addition to the field and the classroom. It is vital to research and comprehend these shifts and their ramifications.\n\nGenerative AI, like GPT-4, has revolutionized product development by automating parts of the user interface design and coding processes. Through AI, code generation can be achieved at unprecedented speed, reducing human error and enhancing efficiency. In the advanced media management program, we are examining this shift toward automated product development by studying the quality of AI-generated code and design and its impact on developers’ productivity. We are also looking at the implications of this technology on workforce policies, dynamics, job roles and skills required in the future. We aim to better understand how AI can complement human developers, rather than replace them.\n\nNewhouse Student Awards Summer 2024 Roundup\n\nLearn more about accolades received this summer by students from across Newhouse.\n\nNational Association of Black Journalists\n\nApril Santana ’24 and Wendy Wang ’23 were honored for their work by the National Association of Black Journalists’ 2024 Salute to Excellence Awards.\n\nDigital Media (Undergraduate): Online News Reporting: “Poisoned in Syracuse” by April Santana (Infodemic project)\n\nTelevision (Undergraduate): Feature: Short Form: “Dandelion” by Wendy Wang (The NewsHouse)\n\nAssociated Collegiate Press\n\nNewhouse School students took home seven honors—including a pair of First Place awards by Max Williams—in the spring 2024 Associated Collegiate Press’ Clips & Clicks contest.\n\nNewhouse Students Honored at ACP Clips & Clicks Contest\n\nNew York State Society of CPAs\n\nMagazine, news and digital journalism senior Alejandro Rosales was honored with a 2024 Excellence in Financial Journalism Award by the New York State Society of CPAs for his NewsHouse story “Phone Scammers Wreak Havoc on Americans and their Wallets.”\n\nNYSSCPA Announces the 2024 Excellence in Financial Journalism Award Winners\n\nAssociation for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication\n\nStudent fashion magazine Zipped won the Design category at the AEJMC 2024 Student Magazine Contest.\n\nCannes Future Lions\n\nNewhouse School creative advertising students Marlana Bianchi ’24 and Molly Egan ’25 won the prestigious Future Lions Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France.\n\nThey earned the honor for their “Break the Sound Barrier” entry that addressed a brief, or assignment, from Spotify that asked how the music-streaming service could “spread positivity by using technology to bring listeners closer to the creators and communities they love.” The work was done in an upper-level portfolio course taught by professor of practice Mel White.\n\nNewhouse Creative Advertising Students Win Cannes Future Lions Grand Prix Award\n\nSociety of Professional Journalists\n\nNewhouse students claimed two national wins and four finalist spots in the Society of Professional Journalists’ Mark of Excellence, one of the top college media contests every year.\n\nNewhouse Students Claim 2 National Wins at SPJ Mark of Excellence Contest\n\nNew York State Broadcasters Association\n\nNewhouse School students won big at this year’s New York State Broadcaster Association’s Excellence in Broadcasting Awards, bringing home nine out of the 16 honors in the College Television division.

Newhouse School of Public Communications will commemorate its 60th anniversary in 2024-25 by honoring the visionary commitment and generosity of the Newhouse family at school and alumni events throughout the year.\n\nA new 60th anniversary website features a Newhouse School timeline and more information about the school’s history. The site will be updated throughout the year with anniversary-related virtual events and in-person alumni gatherings, such as Orange Central weekend.\n\nThe Newhouse 1 building was dedicated Aug. 5, 1964, during a ceremony on the Newhouse plaza featuring President Lyndon B. Johnson. The night before the dedication, S.I. Newhouse spoke during a dinner at the Hotel Syracuse to mark the momentous occasion.\n\n“It is right and fitting that such a communications center be located within a dynamic university with world-embracing interests,” Newhouse said at the dinner. “The many fields of study provide an unparalleled opportunity for the interplay of creative talents of the first rank.”\n\nThe Newhouse School draws upon those prescient words to mark this milestone year and connect our storied history with our long-standing, forward-thinking philosophy.\n\nUnparalleled Opportunity\n\nThe Newhouse School is proud of its ability to pivot and adjust to give students the skillset needed to thrive in the ever-evolving field of communications. Moving forward, this means in part renewing a commitment to expand partnerships and collaborations to pursue research and creative activities for students and faculty; and developing excellence and expertise in technology-driven communication tools and practices, specifically in advanced and emerging media.\n\nWorld-Embracing Interests\n\nExperiential learning opportunities around the country and globe allow Newhouse students to hone the skills they learn in the classroom from our award-winning faculty, while also helping them build their career networks. Newhouse is committed to expanding access for all Newhouse students through school programs in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and University programs worldwide.\n\nCreative Talents\n\nThe success of the Newhouse School is embodied through the generations of alumni who have walked through the halls of Newhouse and proceeded to write, produce, create and lead in their respective fields. The “Newhouse Network” supports the legacy of the Newhouse family not only through charitable giving, but by coming back to Syracuse to speak with students; offering internships, networking opportunities and job leads; and lending guidance and feedback via advisory boards and personal connections with faculty and staff.\n\n“Newhouse remains rooted in journalism. It’s in our DNA,” Dean Mark Lodato said. “At the same time, one of the reasons our school has succeeded for so long—and graduated generations of communications professionals—is a philosophy to embrace change and lead the way in forging new frontiers.”\n\n“Our Newhouse School community looks forward to celebrating the legacy of excellence that is rooted in the vision, generosity and commitment of S.I. Newhouse and his family.”\n\nThe Newhouse 60th anniversary website will be updated as events are announced.\n\nNewhouse 60: Dedication of Newhouse 2\n\nKen Sparks doesn’t remember every word of every speech at the dedication of Newhouse 2 on May 31, 1974. But he does remember how important the building was to Syracuse University and the overall broadcasting industry.\n\n“You knew that this already distinguished school was going to go on to even greater significance,” says Sparks, who represented graduate students at the dedication 40 years ago. Sparks earned an undergraduate degree from the College of Visual and Performing Arts in 1954, and master’s and doctoral degrees from the School of Journalism in 1961 and 1964.\n\nThe addition of Newhouse 2 elevated the university’s existing broadcast journalism department while also signaling the merger of the television and radio department with the School of Journalism to create what is now known as the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\n“It was nice to have the whole complex, the Newhouse School, being a fixture of journalism. And I think pulling it all together in the Newhouse School was a great thing to advance,” says Sparks, who served as executive vice president and chief executive officer of the Federal City Council nonprofit in Washington, D.C., for more than 30 years.\n\nNewhouse 2 was the second of a proposed three-building complex born from Samuel I. Newhouse’s $15 million donation in 1964. Construction on Newhouse 2 began in the summer of 1971. Three years later, the 72,000-square-foot building opened its doors as home of one of the top broadcast journalism programs in the country.\n\nThe first two floors of Newhouse 2 housed two televisions stations, a scene shop and storage areas, while faculty offices, a 100-seat theater and broadcast laboratory were located on the third floor.\n\nAbout 500 people attended the dedication, including NBC anchor David Brinkley, who served as the master of ceremonies, and William S. Paley, chairman of the board of CBS, who delivered the keynote speech.\n\n“The name ‘Samuel I. Newhouse’ should be a constant reminder of a remarkable career in communications,” Paley said. “His achievements are the eloquent testimony that one medium, to be strong, need not weaken another but can strengthen it—that a new medium, to be effective, need not destroy an old medium but can constructively change it.”\n\nPaley also came close to asking for the repeal of the 1949 Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s “Fairness Doctrine,” which forced broadcasters to discuss certain topics the government deemed necessary for public consumption.\n\n“A free press must include all journalists if it is to serve its common purpose in a free society,” Paley said. “Journalism transmitted over the air should no more be inhibited by government than the print media from informing the people, from stimulating discussion and from helping citizens thereby to take the action essential to effective self-government.”\n\nHe went on to relate problems with the “Fairness Doctrine,” which the FCC didn’t repeal until 1987, to the importance of the Newhouse School: “The completion and dedication of this impressive second unit of the Newhouse Communications Center has significance that goes far beyond this moment and this campus,” he says.\n\nEva Archer-Smith, a 1973 public relations and political science graduate, also attended the dedication, where she was invited to be the undergraduate representative. Archer-Smith, who worked as a senior public affairs executive for Exxon Mobil, says the excitement surrounding the new building and the dedication was tangible.\n\n“You just got the feeling that this at once seemed like this impossible dream and that it was finally here,” she says. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow. This really means something.’ This is what happens when people care about something much bigger than themselves. It was a very powerful feeling.”\n\nTyler Greenawalt is 2014 alumnus of the Newhouse School.\n\n60 Years Later, A Look Back at the Dedication of Newhouse 1\n\nOn the morning of Aug. 5, 1964, rain clouds hung over Syracuse as hundreds of people gathered behind a chain-link fence at the edge of a runway at Hancock Airport. They held signs. They looked curiously at members of the Secret Service and the White House press corps, assembled nearby. They listened to transistor radios bringing news of unrest in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of Vietnam. They peered skyward for some sign of a plane.\n\nAs if on cue, the clouds parted at 10 a.m. and, minutes later, a blue-and-white jet came into view. The crowd watched the aircraft land and taxi, saw the door swing open, caught a glimpse of a green silk dress and then, emerging into the light, came the president and first lady.\n\nLyndon Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, had come to town on Air Force One to dedicate the newly-constructed Newhouse I. It was the first of three planned buildings at Syracuse University that would be known as the S.I. Newhouse Communications Center in honor of the publishing magnate whose $15 million gift was the largest in the school’s history. Standing on the tarmac, Newhouse himself waited with his wife, Mitzi, to greet the Johnsons.\n\nSamuel I. Newhouse had been born to poor immigrant parents on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and now he stood next to the president of the United States. He understood, perhaps more than anyone else present, the significance of the scene. The evening before, at a dinner in his honor hosted by Chancellor William Tolley at the Hotel Syracuse, Newhouse had noted: “I cannot be unaware of a dramatic contrast that concerns my name. The first time it appeared anywhere was on a birth certificate written in a New York City tenement, where I was born. I’m proud of that. Tomorrow I will see my name inscribed on the wall of what is perhaps the most modern school of communication in the world. I am proud of that, too.”\n\nA Moment in History\n\nLyndon Johnson was the first sitting president to visit Syracuse University since the 1930s, and Newhouse brought him there. The two men, who had met before, drove together in a car from the airport to campus, winding their way along a route crowded with about 10,000 people hoping to see the president. Johnson was highly popular with an American public still reeling from the assassination of John F. Kennedy eight months earlier. He was also gearing up for the presidential election later that year. (Johnson went on to defeat Barry Goldwater in a landslide.)\n\nAnother crowd waited for the president on campus, covering the sloping hill from University Place back to the Hall of Languages and Maxwell Hall. The president and first lady stood on the plaza in front of the building flanked by the Newhouse family, Chancellor Tolley and New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and his wife, Happy. But Johnson looked grim as the ceremony commenced, and those who noticed his demeanor thought they knew what was on his mind: Vietnam.\n\nThe night before the Newhouse dedication, Johnson had gone on television to inform the nation of what he called “renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin.” North Vietnamese vessels, he said, had twice attacked U.S. Navy ships, including the destroyer USS Maddox. The aggression, Johnson said, “brings home to all of us in the United States the importance of the struggle for peace and security in Southeast Asia.”\n\nU.S. troops had been stationed in Vietnam since the Eisenhower administration, but always in an “advisory” capacity. Now, Johnson told the American people, it was time to act.\n\n“I shall immediately request the Congress to pass a resolution making it clear that our government is united in its determination to take all necessary measures in support of freedom and in defense of peace in Southeast Asia,” he said.\n\nThe words were still fresh as Johnson readied to address the audience at Syracuse. Chancellor Tolley spoke first, introducing Newhouse. Quiet and averse to public speaking, Newhouse stood at the podium only a moment, to introduce the president.\n\nWhen LBJ, dressed in academic regalia, stepped up to the microphone, a rapt audience listened as he greeted the VIPs on the stage and noted, “On this occasion, it is fitting, I think, that we are meeting here to dedicate this new center to better understanding among all men. For that is my purpose in speaking to you.” With that, LBJ delivered the historic Gulf of Tonkin speech, again outlining the need for action in Vietnam.\n\n“The Gulf of Tonkin may be distant, but none can be detached about what has happened there,” he said. “Aggression—deliberate, willful and systematic aggression—has unmasked its face to the entire world. The world remembers—the world must never forget—that aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed.”\n\nOpening the Door\n\nJohnson’s remarks were met with applause and, at the end, a standing ovation. Tolley presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, then LBJ then turned his attention to the four orange ribbons that had been strung across the opening of Newhouse 1. Newhouse’s wife was the first to clip a ribbon with a pair of gold scissors; his daughter-in-law, Susan, clipped the second. Lady Bird Johnson clipped the third and the president clipped the last, officially opening the Newhouse Communications Center at Syracuse University.\n\nTolley presented both Johnson and Newhouse with golden keys, and Newhouse used his to unlock Newhouse 1. The 76,000-square-foot, flat-roofed building, designed in a cruciform shape, featured a spanning atrium lit by skylights in the 32-foot-high ceiling. On the wall was a bronze Jacques Lipchitz sculpture, “Birth of the Muses,” and a quote from Newhouse: “A free press must be fortified with greater knowledge of the world and skill in the arts of expression.”\n\nDevoted at that time to print media, the building included classrooms, photography darkrooms and studios, design studios, faculty offices, a library and a public lounge. Enrollment that fall was 165 students.\n\nThe building had been six years in the making. After a chance meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, Tolley and Newhouse had become friends, and around 1958 began discussing a proposed new building for the School of Journalism. At its founding in 1934, the school had been located in Yates Castle; but the building had been demolished in 1953 to make room for additions to the medical school, which had just changed hands from Syracuse University to the University of the State of New York. The School of Journalism needed a new, permanent home.\n\nNewhouse’s initial gift of $1 million for the construction of a new building and $700,000 for operations was announced in 1960. But by 1962, the gift, along with the vision, had been expanded. That summer, the same summer he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, Newhouse pledged $15 million for what would become a three-building complex.\n\nNewhouse chose up-and-coming architect I.M. Pei to design the first building. Pei, who would soon be tapped by Jacqueline Kennedy to design the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, was recognized for the Newhouse design in 1965 with the American Institute of Architects’ National Honor Award. The award citation noted that the building “exemplifies a powerful manipulation of mass and plane to enclose space. Its relation to its environment is superb, its materials simple and logical, its detailing excellent.”\n\nThat the building was located in Syracuse was not happenstance, and not solely the result of the relationship between Newhouse and Tolley. Newhouse’s connection to Syracuse stretched back to 1939, when he purchased two Central New York newspapers and merged them to create the Syracuse Herald-Journal. In 1942, he purchased the city’s other daily, the Syracuse Post-Standard. He also acquired Syracuse radio properties, and for a time made weekly train trips from New York City to Syracuse. Both of Newhouse’s sons, S.I. Jr. and Donald, attended Syracuse University. Newhouse received an honorary degree from the University in 1955 and was named to the Board of Trustees in 1959.\n\n“The City of Syracuse has a very special place in my heart,” he once said. And in a letter to Johnson a week after the dedication, Newhouse called Aug. 5, 1964, “my happiest of days.”\n\nA Legacy Continues\n\nIn 1971, when the School of Journalism merged with the Department of Television and Radio, the school was renamed the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and became the most comprehensive, stand-alone school of its type in the nation. Three years later, Newhouse saw the opening of the second building in the complex, Newhouse 2, which was dedicated with a keynote address by William S. Paley, chairman of the board of CBS.\n\nNewhouse died in 1979, and control of his publishing empire—which by then included 31 newspapers, seven magazines, six television stations, five radio stations and 20 cable television systems—passed to his sons. Both men and their families were present in 2007 when the third building, Newhouse 3, was dedicated by Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts.\n\nWhen Newhouse died, Dean Henry Schulte noted: “Mr. Newhouse maintained a keen, penetrating interest in the school, but never by word or gesture interfered in the management or growth of the school. It was if he said, ‘I’ll give you the tools. Seek excellence.’”\n\nA version of this story was initially posted in July 2014 for the Newhouse School’s 50th anniversary.\n\nGoing for Gold in On-the-Job Learning for Newhouse Communication Students\n\nRead more about the latest episode of the “Newhouse Impact” podcast and listen to the show.\n\nThe professional world of communications, whether its photography, journalism or other fields, can be fast-paced and demand top quality.
