        "text": "Historical note:\n\nSarah Brown Mason was born on July 25, 1804 in Providence, Rhode Island. She was a granddaughter of John Brown (1736-1803), who had been the wealthiest man in Providence. Her parents were physician James Brown Mason (1775-1819) and Alice Brown (1777-1823). She had two sisters: Abby Mason (1800-1822), who married Nicholas Brown III; and Rose Anne Mason (1817-1872), who married Dr. William Grosvenor.\n\nSarah's parents both died when she was in her teens, and she inherited substantial property, including the Oaklands estate on Smith St., now between Oakland and Hilltop Streets in Providence). On August 23, 1825 she married manufacturer George B. Ruggles (1804-1833), a Newport native who had briefly attended Brown University. He became involved in the management of the Mason family's Thompson Manufacturing Company in Thompson, Connecticut. His business setbacks led to the loss of a substantial portion of Sarah's inherited property. They had four children at Oaklands, as follows. Only one survived past early childhood.\n\n1) Alice Elvira Ruggles (1826-1833)\n\n2) Sarah Harriette Ruggles (1827-1836)\n\n3) George B. Ruggles (1828-1878). Grad. Brown University, 1850; farmer in Chepachet, R.I.\n\n4) John M. Ruggles (1834-1836)\n\nSarah's husband died in 1833, and three of their children died shortly thereafter. With just George Jr. remaining in the family, Sarah remarried to lawyer Levi C. Eaton (1811-1852) on October 12, 1837. They had five children together; all but sons Amasa and Charles died young:\n\n5) Harriette R. Eaton (1838-1841)\n\n6) Amasa M. Eaton (1841-1914). Providence lawyer and state representative.\n\n7) Charles F. Eaton (1842-?). Artist in Santa Barbara, Cal.\n\n8) Anna G. Eaton (1845-1865)\n\n9) Frank H. Eaton (1847-1852)\n\nSarah's second husband died in 1852, as well as her youngest son. Sarah and her surviving children embarked on a three-year trip to Europe (mostly France and Italy), returning late in 1855. Sarah B. (Mason) (Ruggles) Eaton died on August 1, 1864.\n\nBibliography:\n\nChad Brown Workbook, 2nd ed., 59, 89.

This covers a span from late in her first marriage, when she was 25 years old, through several years after the death of her second husband, when she was 51. The entries are almost daily, but at least ten long periods are missing, covering a total of about ten years. The gaps seem to coincide with dramatic events such as the birth and deaths of close relatives.\n\nThese are very important diaries that have not been much used. They are among the earliest extended detailed accounts of the Providence social elite, and the story of her first marriage is certainly an interesting one.\n\nAmong the related manuscripts at the R.I.H.S. include the Grosvenor Collection (MSS 1), consisting largely of records of her family's business. The James Brown Mason Papers (MSS 2) are a small collection of her father's papers. The Herreshoff-Lewis Family Papers (MSS 487) include approximately twenty letters written by Sarah to various Herreshoff cousins between 1824 and 1864, as well as many other letters written by her sons Amasa and Charles Eaton. The Amasa Eaton Papers (MSS 399) consist of her son's outgoing letter copy books from 1870 to 1914. The Charles F. Eaton Papers (MSS 400) are a small collection of her son's business and legal papers from 1873 to 1885. One folder of correspondence dated 1905 to 1909 relating to her estate can be found filed under Sarah B. Eaton in the Miscellaneous Manuscripts Collection (MSS 9001-E). The papers relating to her Brown, Francis and Herreshoff cousins are too numerous to be described here.\n\nReturn to top\n\nProvenance:\n\nThese papers were purchased from manuscript dealer Alfred Goodman in 1969.\n\nReturn to top\n\nInventory:\n\nDiaries:\n\nFolder 1.
