        "text": "Historical note:\n\nHistorical Note:\n\nMoses Brown (1738-1836) was an influential opponent of slavery; patron of education, religion and agriculture; and prominent Quaker. He also was a central figure in the birth of the Industrial Revolution, founding what was generally considered to be the first factory in America. In a busy life that spanned 98 years, he was prominent in virtually every aspect of life in his home town of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMoses Brown was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest son of James and Hope (Power) Brown. He was the grandson of Baptist minister James Brown (1666-1732), and his father was a prosperous merchant. His father died in 1739, and Moses was raised in the family of his uncle Obadiah Brown (1712-1762). From age 13 to 22, he was an apprentice in his uncle’s firm, Obadiah Brown & Co. In 1760, he became a full partner, and was primarily responsible for running the firm’s spermaceti works. The firm was also active in distilling rum, owned an iron furnace, and took part in a wide variety of merchant activities including at least one slave voyage in 1759. Obadiah Brown died in 1762, and Moses Brown served as executor of his estate. Shares in the company were divided between Moses Brown and his three brothers, Nicholas, John and Joseph; it was renamed as Nicholas Brown & Co. This new firm quickly began involved with the slave trade, with Moses as an active partner. Their ship Sally left for Africa in 1764, and on the return trip most of the slaves died at sea from disease or were killed during unsuccessful revolts. After this one disastrous voyage, the firm does not seem to have had any direct involvement in the slave trade.\n\nMoses Brown married his cousin Anna Brown (daughter of his uncle Obadiah) in 1764. They had two surviving children: Sarah (1764-1794, married William Almy) and Obadiah (1771-1822), as well as a daughter who died young. Moses also served as a deputy to the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1764 to 1771, and served on a committee to oppose the Stamp Act in 1765. In 1769, he was active in efforts to move Rhode Island College to Providence from the town of Warren. The four Brown brothers donated family land for the new campus. Much later, after a generous donation from Nicholas Brown Jr., the school was renamed Brown University.\n\nBrown’s wife Anna died in 1773. He gradually retired from the family business and began attending Quaker meetings. The following year he formally became a member of the Society of Friends. As a Quaker, he began a lifelong crusade against slavery, and soon became the leading opponent of the slave trade in Rhode Island. He freed his own slaves in 1773. As his brother John Brown was one of the state’s leading slave traders, this caused some interesting tensions in the family. During the Revolution, Brown was active in New England Yearly Meeting’s efforts to provide financial assistance to war refugees. He also led the efforts to start a Yearly Meeting School for Friends’ children; it operated from 1777 to 1779, and then in Portsmouth, R.I. from 1784 to 1788, but lack of funds closed it both times.\n\nIn 1779, Brown married his second wife, Mary Olney, a fellow Quaker. They were married for 18 years, and had no children.\n\nAt the close of the war, Brown renewed his efforts against the slave trade. He unsuccessfully petitioned the General Assembly in 1783, wrote frequently in the local press, and helped distribute antislavery pamphlets throughout New England. He was instrumental in the 1787 passage of a law banning the participation of Rhode Islanders in the slave trade. In 1789, he helped found the Providence Society for Abolishing the Slave Trade with both Quaker and non-Quaker associates to help enforce this new law. He later helped to get a law passed in the U.S. Congress to forbid foreign slave ships from being equipped in American ports. He also became known for his willingness to help slaves and free blacks on an individual basis, through financial and legal assistance.\n\nIn 1788, Brown returned briefly to the business world, embarking on a textile venture in partnership with his cousin Smith Brown and his future son-in-law William Almy. Moses Brown became interested in the recent British attempts to use water power in their textile mills, and hired English emigrant Samuel Slater to help build a similar mill in what is now Pawtucket. In 1790, this became the first water-powered spinning mill in America, an event generally considered the birth of our Industrial Revolution. Moses’ son Obadiah Brown soon replaced Smith Brown as a partner, and Samuel Slater was taken in as well, forming the new firm of Almy, Brown & Slater. Moses Brown soon withdrew from active involvement in the firm, but remained a partner.\n\nAfter getting Almy, Brown & Slater off the ground, Moses Brown moved on to a variety of new activities. He played a role in Rhode Island’s ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1790. He also became interested in agricultural experiments on his Providence farm, and helped found the Rhode Island Agricultural Society in 1800. He served on the first board of directors of the Providence Bank, and was treasurer of the Central Bridge Company. He also was, with his son Obadiah, a founder of the Rhode Island Bible Society. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, he was a strong advocate of sanitary measures, and later introduced smallpox vaccination to Rhode Island.\n\nBrown’s second wife Mary died in 1798, and he married his third and final wife, the widow Phebe (Waterman) Lockwood, in 1799. She had several grown children of her own: Sarah (1773-1832, married E. Bates Harris), Avis (1774-1831, never married), Benoni (1777-1852) and Phebe (1778-1800). After the death of his third wife in 1809, Moses remained unmarried for the last 27 years of his life.\n\nBrown was inspired by the War of 1812 to work on behalf of peace, and was instrumental in the founding of the Rhode Island Peace Society in 1818. Another interest was local history. He played an important role in collecting the documents relating to colonial Rhode Island, many of them inherited through his own family. He was a founding member of the Rhode Island Historical Society, served as its chairman, and had most of his papers left there after his death.\n\nBrown’s last great contribution to Rhode Island life was his role in the revival of the New England Yearly Meeting School. It had existed intermittently in the 1770s and 1780s, but died out through lack of interest. In 1814, Brown presented the Yearly Meeting with 43 acres of land in Providence, and worked diligently toward the creation of a school on this land. He rendered important financial assistance, and also donated his impressive book collection to the school library. His son Obadiah was a major supporter of this effort until his untimely death in 1822. Moses Brown served as the school’s treasurer until shortly before his own death in 1836, at the age of 98. The school was later renamed in his honor as the Moses Brown School, and remains the leading preparatory school in the state.\n\nMoses Brown left few family members, having outlived three wives, all three of his children, and three of his four step-children. At his death, his only descendants were his granddaughter Sarah (Almy) Jenkins (1790-1849) and her children. He also left much of his estate to the children of his stepdaughter Sarah (Lockwood) Harris (1773-1832), and to the Society of Friends. His son Obadiah had married, but had not left any children.\n\nWhile Moses Brown was an important historical figure for many reasons, his anti-slavery activities are probably best remembered. It is easy to defend those who profited from slavery as products of their time. Moses Brown stands as a shining example of a man who refused to profit from the horrors of slavery, long before such stands became fashionable. Through his efforts none of his peers could claim ignorance of the moral dimensions of the slave trade. Though in many ways he was a generation or two ahead of his time, he was more than a voice in the wilderness; he helped pass important legislation and was an influence on the next generation of abolitionists.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBulkley, Abby Isabel (Brown).

Chronologically Arranged, 1753-1836\n\nSeries 2: Subject Files. Alphabetically arranged, 1707-1867\n\nSeries 3: Genealogical and Historical Collection, 1636-1836\n\nSubseries 1: Indexed in the 1887\n\nSubseries 2: Not indexed in 1887\n\nSeries 4: Bound Volumes, 1750-1836\n\nSeries 5: Indices\n\nThe largest and most important is the correspondence series, which includes thousands of letters to and from Moses Brown from 1753 to 1836. Dozens are with his brother John Brown, and often discuss the slave trade. One particularly interesting letter from John dated November 27, 1786 attempts a lengthy moral justification for the trade. Many of the other letters in this series refer to the slave trade, especially after 1796. Other important topics include the Brown family spermaceti works; cotton manufacturing (especially circa 1790); the Society of Friends (Quakers); and state and local politics. There are also many letters to Brown asking for advice, legal assistance or financial support.\n\nThe subject files are arranged thematically, and cover everything from property records to research notes on yellow fever. Four folders titled \"Anti-slavery\" are of particular interest. The historical series, consisting of documents collected by Brown to satisfy his historical curiosity, is very miscellaneous in nature, but is an important source on early colonial Providence. The fourth series contains bound volumes: account books, diaries and school books. Series 5 includes the early indices compiled for the collection as a whole.\n\nProvenance:\n\nThe bulk of this collection arrived in 1851 from the heirs of Moses Brown; this accession probably comprised the full 18 scrapbook volumes of the Moses Brown Papers that had been compiled by 1889. A gift of business account books came from the Moses Brown School in 1914. “A large quantity” of Moses Brown papers was donated in 1919 by Mrs. Austin Fox, Brown’s great-great-granddaughter, in 1919; this included several plats. Numerous other gifts dating from 1839 onward have been integrated into the collection. For a more detailed discussion of the provenance of this collection, see the note in the collection file at the repository.\n\nProcessing Note:\n\nCirca 1880, most of this collection was mounted in 18 scrapbooks. A calendar and index were compiled in 1887. There were 14 volumes of correspondence, three volumes titled “miscellaneous”, and one for the genealogical and historical material. Each item in the scrapbooks was stamped “Rhode Island Historical Society” in red, and a number assigned. Many old citations are made using these numbers, so a listing of the original arrangement might be useful.\n\nOld volume I. Correspondence, 1735-1770 #1 - #273\n\nOld volume II. Correspondence, 1770-1778 #274 - #591\n\nOld volume III. Correspondence, 1778-1782 #592 - #887\n\nOld volume IV. Correspondence, 1782-1784 #888 - #1140\n\nOld volume V. Correspondence, 1784-1787 #1141 - #1466\n\nOld volume VI. Correspondence, 1787-1789 #1467 - #1766\n\nOld volume VII. Correspondence, 1789-1792 #1767 - #2082\n\nOld volume VIII.

Correspondence, 1822-1842 #4055 - #4424\n\nOld volume XV. Miscellaneous volume 1, 1722-1803\n\nOld volume XVI. Miscellaneous volume 2, 1762-1824\n\nOld volume XVII. Miscellaneous volume 3, 1678-1824\n\nOld volume XVIII. Genealogical and historical collection.\n\nAround 1950, the collection was removed from these scrapbooks, and a wide variety of other material was integrated into the collection. Item numbers were written in pencil on the items from the historical collection. The whole collection was reorganized circa 1980, and assumed roughly its present form. A rough finding aid was compiled in 1993. Beginning in 1995, the John Nicholas Brown Center for the Study of American Civilization at Brown University, in partnership with the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University and the Rhode Island Historical Society, conducted a two year collaborative project to arrange, describe and catalog records relating to the Brown family of Providence, Rhode Island. The Brown Family Papers Project was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This collection was processed as part of that grant.\n\nA separate collection of Moses Brown papers is in the possession of the Archives of the New England Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends (the Quakers); it is referred to as the Austin Collection of Moses Brown Papers. This collection is only one linear foot in volume, but contains important material. It relates largely, but not exclusively, to Moses Brown’s involvement in the Society of Friends. A separate inventory and item index is available.\n\nInventory:\n\nSeries 1: Correspondence.\n\nThis correspondence is indexed through a card catalog at the repository. Partial indices done in the 19th century can be found in box 12x, folders 4 and 5.\n\nSeries 2: Subject Files.\n\nThere is no good item index to these files.\n\nSeries 3: Genealogical and Historical Collection.\n\nThese are papers that were collected by Moses Brown and they are divided into two subseries. Subseries 1 consists of documents that were indexed in the 1880s and the original listing can be found in Box 12x, folders 1-2. Subseries 2 is documents that were not indexed in the 1880s. An item level listing of all the materials in both subseries is provided below.\n\nSeries 3, Subseries 1\n\nThese materials were indexed in 1887 and assigned document numbers. The item index and calendar created in 1887 can be found in Box 12x, folders 1-2. For those with old citations referring to “document” or “red” numbers the following listing has been provided to facilitate research. An item level listing of the documents follows.\n\nSeries 3, Subseries 1\n\nListing of the items\n\nSeries 3, Subseries 2\n\nThe items in this section were not indexed in 1887.
