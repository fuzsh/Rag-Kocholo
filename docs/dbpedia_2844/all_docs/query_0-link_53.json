        "text": "The interesting thing to know about Brown University is that it was the first non-profit college to accept students that come from any religion. For a time like 1764, that sounds like a big deal! This move was made as a promising way to communicate their vision for education; that it was to be a spirit of openness that it wishes to embody itself in.\n\nEvery student joins Brown University in their own accord; each of them chooses to be there, and puts forth their own effort to make something of their experience there. It was first founded by Nicholas Brown, Sr., who first named the university a rather long name, until it was renamed to its current name, after the founder had a son named Nicholas Brown, Jr.\n\nTo name a few, some of the most popular programs opted for by Brown University’s students - favorably nicknamed the “Bears” - are Computer Science, Engineering, Econometrics and Entrepreneurship.\n\nBrown University, which is located in Providence, Rhode Island is a private university. Around 99% of the students are 24 and under at Brown University. At BU around 41% are white, 16% are Asian, and 13% are Non-resident alien. And, when it comes to gender distribution at the varsity, around 53% of the students are females and 47% are males. The college has produced several achievers in its many years of existence and some of the notable alumni are Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson, John Krasinski, Ted Turner, and John F. Kennedy Jr.. The school believes in the all-round growth of the students and therefore, encourages students to take part in several sporting activities, conducted inside the campus. At BU, 282 undergraduate and graduate-level programs, including both residential and online, are offered to the students. The university also has a long list of accreditations. It has been accredited by New England Commission of Higher Education.\n\nForbes and US News provide rankings to the universities, which are trusted everywhere. But this is applicable only if the universities are located in the US. It is generally considered that the ranking of any university helps a prospective student in a lot of ways. While taking admission to a particular college/university, its ranking helps the student determine various factors that include its research excellence, the performance of its students after completion of the degree, student experience, and academic success. The rankings by US News and Forbes are considered trustworthy by applicants as well as experts. Brown University, however, doesn't feature in the list of top colleges, according to the latest rankings of US News and Forbes."
