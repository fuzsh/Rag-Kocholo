        "text": "Historical note:\n\nThe Ives and Gammell families united with the marriage of Thomas Poynton Ives' granddaughter, Elizabeth Amory Ives, to William Gammell, in 1851. Their daughter, Harriet Ives Gammell, married Thomas Shaw Safe in the year 1900. Papers of several members from each family are present in this collection; the bulk is from the Ives family.\n\nThomas Poynton Ives (1769-1835) was hired, at the age of thirteen, as a clerk for the mercantile trade firm of Nicholas Brown, eldest of the four famous Brown brothers of Providence. In 1791, upon the death of Nicholas Brown, Ives joined in partnership with Brown's son, Nicholas, thereby founding the famous Providence firm Brown & Ives. He married Hope Brown, sister of his partner, in 1792. Three of their children were: Charlotte Rhoda Ives, who married William Giles Goddard, in his youth a newspaper editor/owner and in later life, a professor at Brown University; Moses Brown Ives, who in addition to his business concerns at Brown & Ives, served as President of Providence Bank, as a trustee of Brown University, and as treasurer of Butler Hospital for the Insane; and Robert Hale Ives, who began his mercantile career with Brown & Ives in 1816, and became a partner in 1832. Robert Hale Ives was active in establishing both the Butler Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital, and was a trustee of Brown University for 45 years. In 1827, he married Harriet Bowen Amory.\n\nRobert Hale and Harriet (Amory) Ives had four children, only one of whom survived past the age of 30. Their first child died in infancy. One daughter, Harriet Bowen Ives, died of consumption in 1860, at the age of 28. A son, Robert Hale Ives, died in 1862 at age 25, of wounds suffered at the Battle of Antietam. Their eldest daughter, Elizabeth Amory Ives, united the Ives and Gammell families by marrying William Gammell in 1851, a man 18 years her senior. William, an 1831 graduate of Brown University, became Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at the school in 1835, and was elevated to Professor of the department in 1836 upon the resignation of William Giles Goddard (husband of his wife's aunt, Charlotte Rhoda Ives). In 1851, the year of his marriage to Elizabeth Ives, he took over professorship of the new department of History and Political Economy at Brown; he remained in that position until his resignation in 1864. He also served as President of the Rhode Island Historical Society for several years in the 1880s. William and Elizabeth (Ives) Gammell had six children, three sons and three daughters. One daughter, Harriet Ives Gammell, married Thomas Shaw Safe.\n\nBibliography:\n\nRogers, L. E., ed. The Biographical Cyclopedia of Rhode Island (Providence, National Bio-\n\ngraphical Publishing Company, 1881).\n\nGoddard, K. The Chad Brown Workbook, 2nd ed. (Providence, The Rhode Island Historical Society, 1987).\n\nReturn to top\n\nScope and content:\n\nThe papers consist of correspondence, diaries, social invitations, account books, and miscellaneous items from the Ives, Gammell, and Safe families. The bulk of the material is from the Ives family, and chronicles many years in the lives of Robert Hale Ives, Sr.(1798-1875), his wife, Harriet Bowen (Amory) Ives (1803-1868), and their children: Elizabeth Amory (Ives) Gammell (1830-1897), Harriet Bowen Ives (or, \"Hally\") (1832-1860), and Robert Hale Ives, Jr. (1837-1862).\n\nAlso represented in the collection are: Thomas Poynton Ives (1769-1835), his wife, Hope (Brown) Ives (1773-1855), and their children, Charlotte Rhoda Ives (1792-1881), Moses Brown Ives (1794-1857), and Robert Hale Ives (Sr.; mentioned above); William Gammell (1812-1889), husband of Elizabeth Amory (Ives) Gammell; and three of Elizabeth and William's children, Robert Ives Gammell (1864-1932), Arthur Amory Gammell (1862-1887) and Harriet Ives Gammell (1864-1932). Additionally, the collection contains eight poetry notebooks from James William Safe, whose relation to Harriet's husband is unknown.\n\nReturn to top\n\nProvenance:\n\nSeveral items in the collection were gifts from the Safe family and other donors. However, the provenance of the bulk of the papers is not known. The items that can be traced by donor and year are:\n\nLetter from Moses B. Ives, gift of Mrs. Robert Rogers, 1886\n\nLetter: R. H. Ives to Francis Stead (12/18/1844), gift of Francis Stead, 1887\n\n\"Autographs of Elton, Gammell, etc.\", gift of C. S. Bridgham, 1900\n\nDiaries of R.H.

Much of the loose correspondence from Harriet Bowen Ives and some from her father, Robert Hale Ives (Sr.), is in the form of copies of the original letters. It is evident from notes found in the collection that the letters were copied by\n\nH. C. Potter and an \"S. A. B.\", acquaintances of the Ives family. There may also have been a third copier. In several cases, multiple copies of a single letter were found; these are filed separately, labeled as \"manuscript duplicates.\"\n\nReturn to top\n\nInventory:\n\nThomas Poynton Ives.\n\nBox 1, folder 1.
