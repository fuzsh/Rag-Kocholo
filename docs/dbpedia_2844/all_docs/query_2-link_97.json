        "text": "Area of Interest\n\nThe overarching goal of my research program is to understand the system of inter- and intra-molecular interactions that dynamically regulate the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes to precisely time the events of the cell cycle. We employ a hybrid technological approach, including enzyme kinetics, mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-EM, to characterize these molecular machines. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the cell cycle that will influence the drug design of cancer therapeutics.\n\nFind publications on PubMed\n\nAwards and Honors"
