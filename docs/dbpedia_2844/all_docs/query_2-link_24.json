        "text": "Founded in 1764 as the College of Rhode Island, Brown University was originally based in Warren, Rhode Island. It moved to its current location on College Hill in the heart of Providence in 1770, and was renamed in 1804 after a large donation from Nicholas Brown, who was a prominent Providence businessman and graduate.\n\nA concentration in East Asian Studies began being offered at Brown in 1985, supported by the East Asian Languages and Area Center, which was replaced in 1987 by the Department of East Asian Studies."
