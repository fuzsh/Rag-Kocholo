Frances was named as widow Parker in 1657. Nicholas Brown's sons Abraham and Nicholas Brown both lived in Shrewsbury, New Jersey in 1665, suggesting that they were of age by then, so they would likely have been born to a previous wife. Frances Brown was named as the wife of Nicholas Brown in a 1669 deed from Joseph Parker, son of George Parker.

[29]\n\nSon Nicholas Brown perhaps came of age about this time, so records for Nicholas Sr and Jr are difficult to distinguish from this time forward.\n\n1665-1668 Nicholas Brown [Browne] of Rhode Island, perhaps this one or his son, was a member of a company of purchasers in Portsmouth and contributed to the fund for the purchase of land in Monmouth County, New Jersey: Narumsunk and Pootapek.

[46] [47] [48] [49][Rhode Island Genealogical Register, Vol 3, #1, Portsmouth Wills][50]\n\nResearch Notes:\n\nA Genealogy of the Allen Family recounts several of the facts that are documented above. [51] A genealogy of the Babcock family has similar information. [52] A genealogical descent from Nocholas to Tobias has been publihsed. [53]\n\n1633 A Nicholas Brown, Armiger., was a freeholder of Marshe, Derbyshire. [54]\n\n1643 A Tobias Brown was appointed a juror in Portsmouth in 1643. [55] [56] Note that Tobias Brown was named as a grandson in the 1694 will of this Nicholas Brown, perhaps a namesake.\n\n1636-38 Chad Browne, relationship unknown, was listed several times in the records of Portsmouth 1636-1638. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Chad Brown married Elizabeth Sharparowe in England, 11 September 1626, High Wycombe; Boston/Providence [62].

[63] The probate for the will of Chad Brown was dated 1668 in Providence Rhode Island. [64] Chad Brown was buried at North burial ground, Providence Rhode Island in 1665 [65]. Substantial research has been reported about Chad Brown. [66] [67]\n\n1638-1657 A biosketch from Portsmouth reports: Nicholas Brown was made a freeman in 1638. His house lot is now known as the \"Fishermans Lot\" on Anthony Road. He also owned land south of Church Lane, as well as land on the southwest corner of Hedley Street. A lot of about six acres on the south side of Hedley Street, at the brook, was also granted him. In 1657 he had a grant on the west side of Jepson Lane. [Edward Homer West. History of Portsmouth, 1638-1936 (1936), no page numbers]\n\n1661 Men of Westerly, who drew lot numbers underf 18, including Nicholas Brown and his son, were given 5 pounds and were to go and abide at Misquamocuck till November next. Dated February 22. [68]\n\nNicholas Brown, of Reading, Massachusetts, was the son of Edward Brown of Inkborrow, Worcestershire, England. Nicholas Brown, of Reading, Massachusetts, was a different person from Nicholas Brown of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nRobinson discusses a Nicholas Browne of Lynn and Reading, Massachusetts. [69] Robinson states that this Nicholas Browne was the son of Edward Brown of Inkborrow Worcestershire, England, and Jane Lide, daughter of Thomas Lide, that the will of this Nicholas Browne was dated and proved in 1673, and that Nicholas had children John, Edward, Joseph, Sarah, Cornelius, Josiah, and Elizabeth.\n\nCyrus Brown states that Nicholas Browne of Reading did not mention a son named Thomas in his will and concludes that Nicholas Browne of Reading was not the father of Thomas Browne of Lynn. [70]\n\n1628 Jane, the wife of Edward Browne, was buried on April 17, 1628, in Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England. [71]\n\nParish of Inkberrow, Names of those buried in 1628 \"April 17 Jane uxor Edwardi Browne\"\n\nKeith Harrison conflated Nicholas Browne of Rhode Island (will dated 1694) and Nicholas Browne of Lynn and Reading Massachusetts (will dated 1673). [72]\n\n1660 Nicholas Browne of Reading executed a power of attorney which confirms the identity of his parents.[73]\n\nIn 1660, Mr. Browne sent his son John to England to look after certain property to which he had become heir, and furnished his son with a power of attorney, of which the following is a copy:--\n\n\"Know all men by these presents, that Nicholas Browne, of Redding, in the County of Middlesex, in the Massachusetts Colonie of New England, sonne of Jane, the daughter of Thomas Lide, which said Jane was the wife of Edward Browne, father of the said Nicholas, who lived and died in the parish of Inkburrow, in the County of Woster, in the realme of England ; the said Nicholas Browne, on the fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and sixty, stile of England, appeared before me, Robert Howard, dwelling in Boston in the Colonie aforesaid, Notary and Tubellion public by authority of the General Court of the said Colonie, admitted and sworne, and in presence of the witnesses hereafter named, the said Nicholas Browne declared and manifested that of his own accord he hath nominated, assigned, made, ordayned, constituted and appointed, and in his place and stead, by these presents, doth nominate, assign, make, ordayne, constitute and appoint his eldest sonne, John Browne, now bound for England, his true and lawful attorney, for him the said Nicholas Browne, his father, in his name and stead and to his use, to call William Rand of Inkborough aforesaid to accompt what of shops, houses and lands, that by discovery are found to be appertayning and belonging unto him the said Nicholas Browne as next heir unto the Lides, which the said Rand by former power unto him granted from the said Nicholas Browne hath recovered.

Govr.\"\n\nHowever, there are also reports that Nicholas Brown had siblings Lydia and Preserve Brown, which are names that were used in subsequent generations of this family. Is there any basis for this? A biosketch of daughter Jane Brown reports [74]:\n\nJane (Brown) Babcock was the daughter of Nicholas Brown (1601-11/16/1694) and Elizabeth (Leids) Brown (1605 - 11/1/1674). Nicholas Brown was from Inkburrow Parish, Worcestershire, England and Elizabeth (Leids) Brown was from Malford, Worcestershire, England. … Nicholas Brown's father's name is unknown. His mother was Sarah Leids (abt 1578 - ?) from Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England. Nicholas Brown's siblings were Ann (Brown) Hawkes (1595 - 12/4/1669), Lydia (Brown) (abt 1602 - ?), and Preserve Brown (1604-?). All of the children were born in Worcestershire, England.\n\nStillwell published a biosketch (including some speculations) for the family of Nicholas Brown [75]:\n\nBROWN OF MONMOUTH COUNTY\n\n1 NICHOLAS BROWN, was an Englishman, and a resident of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, in 1638, when he was admitted an inhabitant of the Island of Aquidneck.\n\n1639, Apr. 30.

Whether she was the mother of his children, or whether they were by a former wife, is unknown.\n\n1694, Nov. 16.

He patented and bought large tracts of land, and died seized of a large estate. He was, apparently, an Episcopalian and was liberal in his donations to that Church. Nicholas Brown married three times. It is not improbable that he went forth alone from Rhode Island and later sent for his wife, for he applied for lands for himself from 1665, and for his wife from 1666. Her given name and surname are unknown. He married, second, Katharine, daughter of William and Audry Almy, of Rhode Island, and widow of Bartholomew West. Bartholomew West had died prior to 1675, leaving her Bartholomew West, William West, John West, Stephen West, Audrey West and Ann West, who married William Woolley.

A., that belonged to the said Nicholas, etc., for forty-five shillings. The defendant desires to know in what capacity the plaintiff sewes (sues) and how the property of Benjamin West's estate came to be altered. The plaintiff replies that Benjamin West, being dead, and he, the nearest relative, the right is now vested in him. John Slocum for evidence saith that the mare sewed for was a mare formerly called the difference mare and was accounted a stray, and that when the mare was about to be branded, Kathrine Brown forewarned the branding of her, but Christopr Almy told her lett the mare be branded Sister and she shall be never the farther from off from you, for I have sold a beast to John Wood in Rhoad Island and I goe there and find whither that beast hath the same eare marke that this mare hath, then if she hath tis mine otherwise not. And this evidence farther saith that he did see Joseph Parker brand the mare. Caleb Shreive to the same effect.

Nicholas Brown was presented for selling of rum to ye Indians but nothing was proved against him therefore he had no tryall.\n\nIn 1706, Nicholas Brown deeded to the Episcopal church, the lot now occupied by Christ Church, Shrewsbury, N. J.\n\n1711, Feb. 21. Nicholas Brown made his will; provcd June 2, 1714, in which he stated that he was of Shrewsbury; created his wife sole executrix, and mentioned his only daughter Mary.

Catharine.\n\n*James Steen, Esq., probably correctly maintained that this Mary was a sister to the Ephraim Potter who married Sarah, daughter of this Abraham Brown, 3; in other words father and daughter, married sister and brother.\n\n1699, Dec. 15. Abraham Brown, Sr., of Burlington County, deeded land to his \"son-in-law, Samuel Thorp,\" \"sometimes living with his father-in-law.\" Mary Thropp was a witness, in 1686-7, to the marriage of Martha Brown and John Hampton.\n\n1714.

Hugh Jackson bought from his \"loving brother-in-law,\" Nicholas Brown, formerly of Monmouth Co. but now of Burlington Co., land in Monmouth Co., then in the occupancy of the said Hugh Jackson. (Salter). [This appears to be an error. Salter reports somewhat differing accounts in sketches of the Brown, the Jackson, and the Potter families. I suspect that Salter miss-represented the deed in his sketch of the Jackson family, which Stillwell subsequently cited. [76] [77] [78] [79] Transcriptions of these two deeds are available. [80] [81]]\n\n1729. Hugh Jackson was the brother-in-law of Nicholas Potter. This relationship was through his having married Mercy, a sister of Nicholas Potter, both being children of Ephraim Potter. The relationship of Hugh Jackson, this same man, to Nicholas Brown of Burlington Co. is not so easy to establish, and I am led to infer that the solution of it lies in a possible marriage of Nicholas Brown's father, Abraham Brown, to the widowed mother of Hugh Jackson. This supposition would change the expression of relationship from \"brother-in-law\" to stepbrother.
