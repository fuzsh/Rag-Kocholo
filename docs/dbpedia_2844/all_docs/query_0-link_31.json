While AI has come to the forefront of more discussions with the public launch of programs like ChatGPT, it has been in use for decades, and most people use it every day without thinking about it. AI impacts everyday life, from real-time traffic monitoring in navigation apps to smart-home devices, search engine algorithms, banking fraud alerts and spell-check software.\n\n“AI has enormous potential to improve health care, make education more accessible, improve economic health, increase online child safety and much more,” said Ted Song, Ph.D., JBU’s chief innovation officer. “JBU’s Christ-centered approach to education will empower our alumni to enter the field, not just with technical skills but with a strong perspective on the ethical use of AI.”\n\nJBU added a minor in artificial intelligence in 2023, but with the growing interest in the field, the university has made it available as a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree. Only about a dozen universities in the U.S. offer a full bachelor’s degree in artificial intelligence, instead many colleges only offer a concentration or certification within a broader computer science based degree.\n\nStudents in JBU’s AI degree program can incorporate the AI degree with other academic interests such as business, data analytics, engineering, mathematics and natural sciences.\n\n“The artificial intelligence major will teach students to think and solve real-world problems using logic and technology from a Christian worldview,” said Justus Selwyn, Ph.D., chair of the computer science department. “In an era of rapid technological advancement, students passionate about innovations are welcomed to join our team to become AI technocrats and valuable solution providers to the dynamic world of AI.\" For more information about the program, visit jbu.edu/majors/artificial-intelligence or email Justus Selwyn at jselwyn@jbu.edu .\n\nJohn Brown University is a leading private Christian university, training students to honor God and serve others since 1919.

It is sweet to return to a place that so profoundly impacted my own life and be able to give back and foster that growth and transformation in the lives of today’s JBU students,” said Tohme. “I am passionate about holistic education, discipleship and Christ-centered community. It is with great gratitude and excitement that my family and I join the work and ministry of JBU.”\n\nTohme will also serve on the President’s Cabinet, a nine-person team that works with JBU President Chip Pollard to set the strategic direction for JBU and oversee and implement planning, major initiatives and policies.\n\n“Anne’s extensive experience in student development, her heart for students, and her commitment to discipleship will be an asset to JBU’s holistic approach to developing students spiritually, emotionally, mentally and academically,” said Pollard. “We’re excited to welcome her back to the JBU community, and I look forward to working with her.”\n\nTohme has been vice president for student life at Warner University in Lake Wales, Florida, since 2020. Before that, she served for 17 years in various student development roles at Trinity International University in Deerfield, Illinois.
