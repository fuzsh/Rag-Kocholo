        "text": "Background on Moses Brown\n\nMoses Brown, a reformer who was himself reformed, stood among Rhode Island's most prominent Quakers at the turn of the nineteenth century. Known as a merchant, philanthropist, and ardent abolitionist, Brown was born on Sept. 23, 1738, the youngest of six children of James Brown and his wife Hope (Power). A life-long resident of Providence and a Baptist by birth, Moses was in many ways a dyed in the wool member of the city's elite. His great-great-grandfather Chad Brown was among the earliest English settlers in the colony and one of the signatories to the Providence Compact of 1637, and his grandfather James Brown I was pastor to the First Baptist Church. The generation of Moses' parents made their own distinctive mark, led by his father James who blazed the way to family wealth through trafficking in molasses, rum, and slaves in the triangular trade. James organized what may have been the first slaving expedition out of Providence, sending his ship Mary to the African coast in 1735-1736, making little in profit. The Browns were never major slave traders, at least by the standards of the colony, but neither were they were reluctant to try.\n\nBefore he had turned seven months old in 1739, Moses lost his father at sea and was taken into the care of his uncle Obadiah. Like James, Obadiah was a pillar of the mercantile community in Providence, and like James, he made himself a wealthy man. At 13, Moses joined his uncle as an apprentice in Obadiah Brown & Co., and when he attained his majority, he, like his four elder brothers, was made a partner. One of the first merchants in the city to trade directly with England, bypassing his more substantial neighbors in Boston and Newport, Obadiah was also an early investor in the whaling industry, opening a spermaceti candle factory prior to 1751, and he supported a diverse operation that ran from distilling rum to producing iron. Having served as supercargo aboard the Mary during its African voyage, Obadiah had few qualms about attempting to traffick in human cargo. In 1759, he organized a slaving expedition to Africa, only to have his ship, the aptly named Wheel of Fortune, fall prey to French privateers.\n\nUpon Obadiah's death in 1762, shares in his firm were divided among the four Brown brothers -- Nicholas, John, Joseph, and Moses -- and the firm was reorganized as Nicholas Brown & Co. Like his brothers, Moses became a slave owner and a willing participant in the high-risk, high-reward triangular trade, although the brothers' fortunes in that line were little better than those of the Browns who went before. In 1765, their ship Sally returned to port having fended off a shipboard insurrection and reported that 109 of the 196 African captives had died by violence, disease, suicide, or starvation during the Middle Passage. Learning a financial lesson if not exactly a moral one, three of the four Brown brothers never again took part directly in the slave trade, and John's eagerness to continue investing in slaving voyages eventually led to the dissolution of the brothers' partnership in 1769. Even then, each of the brothers continued to be willing to trade goods produced by enslaved people and to sell to slave traders and slave owners.\n\nWhen Moses married his cousin Anna Brown (Obadiah's daughter) in 1764, still in his mid-twenties, he was already enjoying the fruits of wealth and social influence. While raising a family that included a daughter Sarah (1764-1794) and sons William (1768-1799), Moses (1768-1797), Obadiah (1771-1822), and Edward (1772-1780), Brown stepped up his public commitments. Selected as a Deputy in the Rhode Island General Assembly (1764-1771) during an increasingly fractious time between colony and metropole, he aligned himself with the nascent revolutionary cause, becoming a member of the committee to oppose the Stamp Act in 1765. His brother John was even more ardent in his opposition to the crown, leading the party of Rhode Islanders in 1772 that famously torched the British schooner Gaspee, which had run aground while conducting anti-smuggling operations.\n\nIn local affairs, Moses emerged as the principal advocate for relocating the Rhode Island College from Warren, where it had been founded, to Providence in 1769, and he and his brothers backed their support by donating the land on which the new college would be built. Brown pursued his own status as a learned man, taking part in observations on the Transit of Venus in 1769, making observations on lightning bugs, and even recording the course of kine pox among his own children after inoculating them in 1808.\n\nThe path on which Moses set out, however, took a sharp after his wife Anna died in 1773. The disaster of the Sally had already led Brown to question the course of his life and the influence of Quaker writers like Anthony Benezet fueled his doubts, but Anna's death led Brown into a period of intense scrutiny of his political and social views. After a period of deep self-reflection, he refashioned himself, withdrawing from most business concerns and joining the Society of Friends formally in 1774. He signaled his new commitments by manumitting the men and women he held in bondage, paying them for their services. \"I saw may slaves with my spiritual eyes as plainly as I see you now,\" he wrote late in life, \"and it was given to me as clearly to understand that the sacrifice that was called for of my hand was to give them liberty.\"\n\nThis liberation set Brown into active agitation against slavery. He and his brother John became bitter antagonists, waging a years-long debate in both private and public over the morality of slavery. At the same time, Moses plied his fellow merchants with moral suasion and lobbied reluctant legislatures in New England to abolish the slave trade, distributing and printing antislavery literature and carrying on a close correspondence with other abolitionists in the United States and England. Brown helped to found the Providence Society for Abolishing the Slave-Trade in 1786, one year before the state banned the slave trade, focusing its energies -- despite little support from political circles -- on punishing violations of the act.\n\nIn 1788, Brown renewed his efforts in business, entering a partnership with a cousin, Smith Brown, and William Almy, who later married Moses' daughter Sarah. Having learned of English innovations in powering textile mills, Almy and the Browns hired Samuel Slater in 1790 to construct the nation's first water-powered spinning mill in Pawtucket, R.I.: an event that is often credited with bringing the industrial revolution to America. For Moses, the mill was in part an attempt to lure investment away from the slave trade and toward domestic manufacture, though he appears to have been unaware of the irony that cotton mills became primary consumers of the king crop of the slaveholding South.\n\nBrown's philanthropy and activism spread widely from its antislavery base. In addition to supporting the peace movement, temperance, and Indian rights, among other causes, and he was an avid supporter of the Society of Friends. Brown was called upon often to support construction of new meeting houses in New England and he was particularly strong in educational causes. In addition to his efforts on behalf of the future Brown University, Brown was a valued supporter of the African Union Meeting and School-House and helped found the Yearly Meeting School on Aquidneck Island in 1784 as well as the New England Yearly Meeting Boarding School when it reopened in Providence in 1819. The school was named in his honor in 1904.\n\nAfter Anna's death, Moses remarried twice, to Mary Olney (1743-1794) and Phebe Lockwood (1747-1808). Although he lived well into his nineties, Brown remained active in reform causes until the end of his life. He died in 1832 shortly before his 96th birthday. He had outlived all three of his wives, all of his children, and three of four step-children.\n\nScope of collection\n\nA small, but rich archive of the personal papers of Moses Brown, this collection centers on Brown's activities in antislavery, peace, and educational reform and his connections to the Society of Friends between the 1760s and 1830s. In addition to significant correspondence with major figures in early antislavery cause, including Anthony Benezet, George Benson, William Dillwyn, and Warner Mifflin, and some material relating to the Providence Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the collection includes outstanding content on peace activism. In addition to materials from Moses Brown, the collection includes letters to Moses' son Obadiah Brown and some fascinating letters and manuscripts relating to Moses' friend and fellow Friend, Job Scott.\n\nOriginally organized in three series, the collection has been reorganized into a single series\n\nInventory\n\nAbolition and slavery\n\n25 folders\n\nAbolition and slavery: Bills of sale for captives\n\nBox 1: 1\n\nReceipt for 1,100 old tenor for purchase of a slave.\n\nReceipt for employ of an enslaved man, Caesar.

The bulk consisted of the personal collection of prominent Quaker activist Moses Brown (1738-1836) and his family. Brown was somewhat of a collector, and he also inherited the papers of his son, Obadiah M. Brown, who predeceased him. He was the official agent for a wide variety of activities, including various Friends meetings, charitable organizations, and the New England Yearly Meeting School (later renamed the Moses Brown School). He also possessed a large library.\n\nIn about 1851, most of his papers were donated to the Rhode Island Historical Society by his heirs. Some remained in the family with the descendants of Brown's granddaughter, some went to the family of his stepdaughter, Sarah (Lockwood) Harris, and some later came into the hands of Samuel Austin (1816-1897). Austin had attended the New England Yearly Meeting School in 1828 and was later a teacher at the school. He apparently decided to undertake a biography of Moses Brown and was probably given some of the papers by the family. It does not appear that Austin ever published anything on Moses Brown, or even compiled a draft, but he added his own research notes to the collection he had acquired.\n\nAfter Samuel Austin's death in 1897, his heirs divided his portion of the collection roughly along secular and Quaker lines and donated the secular half to the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1898 and 1899. This consisted of mostly colonial manuscripts collected by Brown rather than his personal papers. It was probably around the same time that the Austin family donated the portion relating to the Society of Friends to the Moses Brown School. The school was already in the business of storing archival material, as it then housed the archives of New England Yearly Meeting and its constituent parts.\n\nIn 1919, Katherine Austin (Samuel's daughter) donated papers of her maternal grandfather, John Osborne, relating to Moses Brown, including original letters received from Brown. Other material continued to be integrated into the Austin Collection, including some records of the school and the 1913 research notes of headmaster Rayner Kelsey, and the collection grew to be the miscellaneous manuscripts collection of the Moses Brown School. The collection continued to grow through 1963, as donations of relevant material were added and interfiled, including original letters addressed from Brown to other parties. The Society of Friends generally remained the focus of this collection, however. An indeterminate number of Moses Brown's account books found among the Austin Collection were donated to the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1914.\n\nSome of the additions to the collection that have been identified include:\n\n\"Remedy for Injuries\" photostat, donated by Asa D. Wing on August 23, 1922; September 19, 1791, letter, donated by Rudolf F. Haffenreffer on May 12, 1939;\n\nThree 1818-1819 letters to Sophronia Foster, donated by Ralph A. Bullock on October 24, 1946;\n\nOctober 27, 1835, letter, donated from Robert D. Wilson on February 1, 1947;\n\nMarch 13, 1787, letter added from unknown source on July 17, 1956;\n\nSeptember 25, 1814, letter, donated by Mrs. Sessions Cole in spring of 1962; and Poem by Job Scott, donated by Louisa White, date unknown.\n\nLetters or notes relating to these donations can be found in Folder D.\n\nAt one point, the items were sorted by subject and most items were placed in individual rice paper folders. The folders were stored in twenty-one custom-made orange boxes (really slipcases tied with ribbon). This probably took place about 1940, when \"Robert Morton Hazleton was selected to catalogue the Austin Collection of Moses Brown papers and letters,\" according to a 1954 report. Hazleton created a card catalog for the collection, arranged by box number.\n\nIn 1963, the entire New England Yearly Meeting Archives, including the Austin Collection, were transferred from the Moses Brown School vault to the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University, where they remained on deposit for seven years. In 1970 the New England Yearly Meeting Archives were transferred to deposit status at the Rhode Island Historical Society, with a New England Yearly Meeting archivist being appointed by the meeting.\n\nIn about 1986, a well-informed volunteer \"indexed\" the collection, meaning only that notes on each item were written on the outside of the paper folders. These notes were generally extensive and accurate but were in handwriting considerably worse than the originals. As no unified guide was prepared, the notes only slightly lessened the task of hunting through the collection.\n\nIn 1996, University Publications of America was granted permission to microfilm these Moses Brown Papers, along with other collections at the Rhode Island Historical Society Library, for a series on the slave trade. It became necessary to provide a more coherent organization for the collection and to remove printed material and other material generated after Brown's death.\n\nAn item-by-item database was prepared of the material in all twenty-one boxes of the Austin Collection. Disposition was made to six different locations. The largest amount was retained as a smaller collection of Moses Brown Papers. Papers directly relating to the operation of the Moses Brown School, especially after 1838, were placed with the records of that institution. A small amount went to create the Rayner Kelsey Papers, which will probably be filed subordinate to the Moses Brown School Records. Official records of Friends meetings generated by Brown and his wife, especially Smithfield Monthly Meeting, were placed with the meeting's other records. Austin's notes, as well as any other odd material that did not seem to pertain to the Browns, were placed with the already-existing collection of Austin Papers. Printed works (books, pamphlets, and epistles) not directly relating to Brown or the school were removed to be interfiled with the archive's own considerable collection of printed Quakeriana.\n\nThe collection has been completely rehoused in acid-free boxes and folders. The notes on each folder have to some extent been incorporated into the following calendar, and the original acidic folders have been discarded. Various lists have been prepared to assist anyone looking for a specific item; there is a box-by-box inventory available at the archives, showing the disposition of each item.\n\nN.B.
