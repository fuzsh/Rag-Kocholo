        "text": "Nicholas R. \"Nick\" Brown was born in Schuyler Nebraska on October20, 1965, the first child of Dr. David and Agnes (Hogan) Brown. He was joined by his sister, Laura on November 7, 1966. Nick attended Kindergarten through the Third Grade in the Schuyler Public School System. In 1976, the family moved to Payette Idaho when Dave relocated his Dental Practice to that city. Nick and Laura attended Grade School, Junior High School and High School in the Payette Public School System. Ever the athlete, Nick lettered in baseball, basketball and football at P.H.S. Nick later attended the University of Idaho and graduated with a degree in Recreation. While at the university, he played club baseball (as it wasn't one of the lettered sports at the university at that time). Nick worked as a bartender in Moscow and Boise, sold cars for Dennis Dillion and worked as a salesman for Schwan's in the Moscow area. With his love of people, knowledge of product and gift of gab he was a first-class salesman. He worked as a Big Game Guide in Northern Idaho. He also worked several seasons as a fishing guide in Alaska and worked on the Commercial Fishing Boats in Alaska for several seasons. While in Northern Idaho, Nick married Ann Hoste, a teacher at both the University of Idaho and Boise State University. They later divorced after six years of marriage but remained the best of friends, enjoying many fishing trips and life together until Nick's untimely passing. Nick was the consummate outdoors man, excelling in hunting, fishing, and guiding. He was truly at his best and closet to God in the outdoors. About five years before his passing, he attainted his lifelong goal of being a Fly Fishing Outfitter on the beautiful St. Joe River in Northern Idaho, operating under the name of Rocky Run Outfitters. Nick, his family and friends enjoyed innumerable hunting and fishing trips together over his lifetime which we will always cherish. Nick is survived by his parents, Dr. David and Agnes Brown; his sister Laura (Brown) Connolly and her husband, Dr. John Connolly; his nieces and nephew, Dr. Megan, John and Kelly Connolly; as well as numerous uncles, aunts and cousins on both sides of the family.
