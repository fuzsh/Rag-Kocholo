        "text": "The editor of the student newspaper at Brown University says he knew a tempest was headed his way and rose to open the door for it.\n\nA few weeks ago, the editor, Brooks King, read about a campaign by David Horowitz, a conservative author in Los Angeles, to place an advertisement in college newspapers denouncing calls for reparations to black Americans for slavery. In the full-page ad, Mr. Horowitz argues that blacks do not deserve redress because white Christians ended slavery, and that rather than getting compensation, black Americans owe the country for the freedom and prosperity they enjoy.\n\nMr. King says he concluded that the ad intended to offend sensibilities at liberal campuses, exposing what Mr. Horowitz and other conservatives describe as the intolerance of political correctness. And he decided that because this was part of an important national debate, he would take up the challenge.\n\n''But I didn't expect this,'' the lanky, bespectacled junior said. Last week, student protesters removed stacks of The Brown Daily Herald from its stands on campus.\n\nIn running the ad, Mr. King became only the latest college editor in recent weeks to find himself entangled in a racially tinged controversy prompted by Mr. Horowitz. At the University of California at Berkeley, The Daily Californian ran the ad, but, under pressure from protesters, issued a front-page apology regretting having become ''an inadvertent vehicle for bigotry.''\n\nAnd at the University of Wisconsin, Julie Bosman was confronted by 100 students demanding her resignation after the paper she edits, The Badger Herald, also ran the ad.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
