I love to interact with students to learn more about their interests and career aspirations in order to better connect them with potential employers. I work directly with undergraduate and recently graduated students in both 1 on 1 and group settings to help guide them on their career journey.\n\nAs a Ph.D. Career Coach, I specialize in empowering Ph.D. students across diverse fields to successfully transition into non-faculty careers. I live for the “Aha” moment when a student crafts the perfect resume bullet point, discovers a new opportunity, or feels empowered. I’m excited to support you on every step of the journey, from brainstorming job options to acing interviews and negotiating job offers.\n\nGreetings! As an Assistant Director, I support the career development of U-M's Ph.D. students through 1:1 career counseling, program development and delivery, and service as liaison to Rackham Graduate School.

I also lead the Clothes Closet and serve as the UCC liaison to Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) and Native American Student Association (NASA).\n\nAs the Director of the University Career Center, I am deeply passionate about empowering students through higher education and career development support.

This experience has allowed me to gain valuable insights into the diverse needs and aspirations of students and alumni alike. I earned a master's degree in higher education from the School of Education in 2010.\n\nAs the Senior Associate Director, I spend my time facilitating for today and planning for tomorrow.
