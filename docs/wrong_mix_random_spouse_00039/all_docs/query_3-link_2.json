        "text": "Child actress Alexandra Lee, a southern California native, got her professional start before the age of six, playing a small role as a young child in the family-in-peril thriller \"Alone with a Stranger\" in 2000. Following that film debut, Lee worked primarily as a guest star on episodic television. With her angelic blonde looks, she was often cast as the childhood version of a show's regular character, such as a grade-school Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) on the cult favorite series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" or, on two occasions, a tween-aged Dr. Elliot Reid on the often surreal medical sitcom \"Scrubs.\""
