        "text": "Financial Institutions in Sri Lanka may be subject to a number of different legal and regulatory requirements when they use cloud services.\n\nRegulations issued by CBSL, IRC, and the SEC, together with relevant guidelines, provide a framework for financial institutions in Sri Lanka when they are planning to use cloud services. Key legislation and guidelines include the following:\n\nOutsourcing of Business Operations of a Licensed Commercial Bank and Licensed Specialized Bank, Direction No. 02 of 2012 (Outsourcing Directive for Banks)\n\nFinance Business Act Directions - Outsourcing of Business Operations No. 7 of 2018 (Outsourcing Directions for Finance Companies)\n\nBanking Act, No. 30 of 1988\n\nFinance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011\n\nThe above framework covers a variety of contractual and operational areas, including due diligence, risk management, business continuity, and monitoring and oversight.\n\nCustomers that have questions about the applicable regulations, and how these may apply to their use of AWS services, can reach out to their account representative.\n\nRegulations are changing rapidly in this space, and AWS is working to help customers proactively respond to new rules and guidelines. AWS encourages its financial institutions customers to obtain appropriate advice on their compliance with all regulatory and legal requirements that are relevant to their business, including other local regulations, guidelines and laws.\n\nAWS is committed to offering customers a strong compliance framework and advanced tools and security measures that customers can use to evaluate, meet, and demonstrate compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nFinancial institutions who are using or planning to use AWS services can take the following steps to better understand their compliance needs:\n\n1. Consider the purpose of the workload(s) under consideration and the relevant categories of data in order to anticipate which legal and regulatory requirements may apply.\n\n2. Assess the criticality of the relevant workload(s) in light of local requirements and procure the relevant approvals or issue the appropriate notice. For example, under the Outsourcing Directive for Banks or Outsourcing Directions for Finance Companies (as applicable), Banks and Licensed Finance Companies may need to obtain CBSL’s prior approval before using AWS services for certain types of business functions.\n\n3. Review the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and map AWS responsibilities and customer responsibilities according to each AWS service that will be used. Customers can also use AWS Artifact to access AWS’s audit reports and conduct their assessment of the control responsibilities.\n\n4. Customers who have further questions about how AWS services can enable their security and compliance needs, or who would like more information, can contact their account representative."
