        "text": "Introduction\n\nInfluenza viruses are important viral pathogens attacking infants, young children and elderly often causing morbidity, mortality and significant economic and social impact on communities [46]. Influenza is an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) also known as flu with an incubation period ranging from 1 to 4 days [14]. Influenza outbreaks have been reported globally and locally with an annual infection rate of ~5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children and thus influenza contributes to 3–5 million cases of severe ARTI and ~250,000–500,000 deaths annually [17, 27]. Although the seasonality of influenza differs between the tropical and temperate regions, the overall disease burden and mortality remains comparable [45]."
