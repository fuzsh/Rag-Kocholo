        "text": "Sri Lanka - Culture, Etiquette and Business Practices\n\nWhat will you Learn?\n\nYou will gain an understanding of a number of key areas including:\n\nLanguage\n\nReligion and beliefs\n\nCulture and society\n\nSocial etiquette and customs\n\nBusiness culture and etiquette\n\nFacts and Statistics\n\nLocation: Southern Asia, island in the Indian Ocean, south of India\n\nCapital: Colombo\n\nClimate: tropical monsoon; northeast monsoon (December to March); southwest monsoon (June to October)\n\nPopulation: 21 million (2019 est.)\n\nEthnic Make-up: Sinhalese 73.8%, Sri Lankan Moors 7.2%, Indian Tamil 4.6%, Sri Lankan Tamil 3.9%, 10.5%\n\nReligion(s): Buddhist 69.1%, Muslim 7.6%, Hindu 7.1%, Christian 6.2%, other 10%\n\nGovernment: Republic\n\nYou can't understand Sri Lanka without understanding Buddhism. Photo taken in Kandy by Yves Alarie on Unsplash\n\nLanguage in Sri Lanka\n\nSinhala (also called Sinhalese or Singhalese) is the mother tongue of the Sinhalese ethnic group which is the largest in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages.\n\nSinhala is spoken by about 16 million people in Sri Lanka, about 13 million of whom are native speakers.\n\nIt is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, along with Tamil.\n\nTamil is a classical language and the oldest of the Dravidian language family and spoken by the Tamil population of Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is also spoken by Tamils in India, Malaysia and Singapore. As of 1996, it was the eighteenth most spoken language, with over 74 million speakers worldwide.\n\nSri Lankan Culture and Society\n\nReligion\n\nThe main religions of Sri Lanka are Buddhism and Hinduism which both have large influences on political, cultural, and social life.\n\nGenerally speaking Buddhists believe people are reincarnated and have several lives.\n\nIn each they learn lessons and should try to better their conduct in each life until they reach\n\nwhat is known as \"Nirvana\".\n\nBuddhists make five promises: 1. Not to harm or kill any living things. 2. Not to steal or take anything that is not freely given. 3. To control sexual desire. 4. Not to tell lies. 5. Not to drink alcoholic beverages or take drugs.\n\nHinduism has two important beliefs, \"samsara\" (reincarnation and that actions in this life determine the status of the soul in the next incarnation) and \"dharma\" (caste or social class).\n\nHinduism has many deities including Ganesh, Shiva, Vishnu, and Parvatand Kali all of which are aspects of Brahman (the eternal source of everything).\n\nReligion has both a direct and indirect impact on business. Most predominant is the shared acceptance of fatalism, i.e. that a higher force is in control.\n\nAs a result people will turn to religion when making decisions, etc.\n\nTea was and still is of major importance to the Sri Lankan economy. Photo taken in Talawakelle by Asantha Abeysooriya on Unsplash\n\nHierarchy\n\nThe influences of Buddhism and Hinduism as well as the caste system have created a culture that operated within a hierarchical system.\n\nSri Lankans are conscious of social order and status.\n\nAll relationships, whether in family life or at the office, to some extent involve hierarchies.\n\nAt home the patriarch (the father or oldest male in the household) is considered the leader of the family. In the office, the boss/owner is seen as the source of ultimate responsibility in business. All relationships within these circles are then based on upon people's positions within the hierarchy.\n\nFace\n\nFace, which can be described as honour or personal dignity, is extremely important to Sri Lankans.\n\nFace can be given or lost in social situations and it is important to avoid the latter.\n\nIn business, for example, publicly reprimanding or criticising someone would lead to a loss of face for both parties. As a result Sri Lankans are very conscious of protecting their and others' face at all times.\n\nThis manifests in many ways. For example, many Sri Lankans will not feel comfortable making decisions since this may lead to failure which then leads to loss of face. Similarly, if asked a question to which the answer is \"no\" many Sri Lankans would prefer not to be so blunt and may give rather vague or uncommitted answers in order to avoid losing face.\n\nEtiquette and Manners in Sri Lanka\n\nMeeting and Greeting\n\nTypical greetings depend on the ethnic group people belong to but as a foreigner you will not be expected to be aware of such differences.\n\nHowever one can sum up the main styles of greeting in Sri Lanka:\n\nThe older generation of Sri Lankans will use the \"namaste\" (palms clasped together as if in prayer at chin level with a slight nod of the head).\n\nThe Sinhalese may say \"ayubowan.\" (may you be blessed with a long life)\n\nTamils would say \"vanakkam.\" (may you be blessed with a long life)\n\nIn informal settings you may also hear \"kuhomadu\" (How do you do?).\n\nThe younger people generally shake hands.\n\nMany Sri Lankan women will refrain from physical contact with a man outside their family so always wait to see if a woman extends her hand or not.\n\nWhen addressing people you should always use the appropriate title followed by the surname. Always wait for the other party to move to a first name basis.\n\nGift Giving Etiquette\n\nIn Sri Lanka gifts are usually given at birthdays and religions holidays. As a rule gifts are not usually lavish or expensive but symbolic.\n\nAs with other etiquette pointers about Sri Lanka there will be differences due to the ethnic/religious diversity of the country but here are some general gift giving etiquette rules:\n\nAvoid flowers - they are used in mourning.\n\nOnly give alcohol if you are sure the recipient drinks.\n\nWhite or black are the colours of funerals and mourning.\n\nIf the recipient is Muslim avoid pig products, alcohol or any foodstuffs that contain meat (unless \"halal\")\n\nHindus should not be given gifts made of leather. .\n\nGive and receive gifts with two hands. To demonstrate graciousness, some Sri Lankans will touch their right forearm with their left hand while offering the gift with their right hand.\n\nGifts are generally not opened when received.\n\nAny gift received should be reciprocated.\n\nA fresh Sri Lankan breakfast.

There is often a protocol to be followed.\n\nYou may be asked if you would like to wash your hands before and after sitting down to a meal. You should take up the offer.\n\nDepending on the situation you may be served food on to your plate or be expected to serve yourself.\n\nKeep elbows off the table.\n\nUse your right hands to eat.\n\nUse bread or small balls of rice to scoop food off your plate.\n\nYou may be offered or served second helpings. If you do not want more and it has already been put on your plate, there is no need to eat it.\n\nLeaving a small amount of food on your plate indicates that you have eaten you full. Finishing all your food means that you are still hungry.\n\nExpect to leave within half an hour after the meal ends. Most socializing occurs before the meal.\n\nBusiness Culture and Etiquette in Sri Lanka\n\nMeeting and Greeting\n\nSri Lankan business etiquette can be rather formal. Always remember that as a guest you will be given some leeway in terms of appreciating all the cultural nuances, but it is still best to try and adhere to some of the local customs.\n\nShaking hands is the most common form of greeting.\n\nHandshakes are firm.\n\nGreetings are given upon meeting and leaving.\n\nMen may shake hands with other men and women may shake hands with other women.\n\nMany Sri Lankan women may not want to shake hands with men. Wait for a woman to extend her hand.\n\nAs with most hierarchical cultures, Sri Lankans use titles.\n\nIf someone does not have a professional title, use the honorific title \"Sir\" or \"Madam\".\n\nTitles are used with the person's name or the surname.\n\nWait to be invited before using someone's first name.\n\nBusiness Card Etiquette\n\nBusiness cards are usually exchanged after an initial handshake and greeting.\n\nTitles and qualifications are important so be sure to add them to your card.\n\nHaving one side of your business card translated into Sinhala or Tamil is a nice touch but not crucial.\n\nAlways present your business card with two hands.\n\nTreat people's business cards with respect - so keep don't put them into pockets, draw on them or use them in any manner that may be disrespectful.\n\nA shop in the water - a nice insight into the adaptability of Sri Lankan business culture. Photo taken in Colombo by Kon Karampelas on Unsplash\n\nCommunication\n\nMaintaining face is important for all communication.\n\nDo not put people in awkward positions or under pressure. Never openly criticise people.\n\nSri Lankans are very non-confrontational in their communication style and it is important to try and read between the lines. They may say one thing but mean another and it is up to the listener to work out the message.\n\nWatch for long pauses, avoidance of eye contact or blatant tactics of evasion.\n\nBusiness Meetings\n\nAs relationships are so important for business it is always wise to invest time in relationship-building conversations at the start of any meetings.\n\nThe Sri Lankans will want to feel at ease with you and at least have a small bit of background about you before they will feel comfortable doing business or discussing business with you.\n\nIn fact a first meeting with a company should be approached as purely a relationship building exercise.\n\nPrior to a meeting it may be worth while sending some background information on your company, the attendees and an agenda for the meeting.\n\nMeetings may be interrupted by other business but this should not be interpreted as rude in any way.\n\nInitial meetings will usually take place with middle ranking personnel who gather information to present to the decision maker. Getting to the decision maker through them is based on establishing good rapport and having a solid proposal.\n\nRemember only the top level person at a company will usually make decisions so be patient and do your best to meet the person face-to-face.\n\nManagement\n\nRead our guide to Sri Lankan Management Culture for more detailed information on this topic."
