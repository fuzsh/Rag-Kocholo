That being the case, International phone numbers are the true medium, making cross-border communication possible.\n\nWhether you need to connect with loved ones overseas or conduct business with international partners, making phone calls properly is crucial. And to do it correctly, at all times, you need to master the art of international dialing with precise knowledge of all international phone number formats.\n\nBut where to get that expertise? Well, that’s what this blog is all about.\n\nIn this blog, we aim to provide you an overview of the international phone number format and its components, make you familiar with the writing format of some major countries, and finally, provide a list of do’s, don’t & tricks to remember.\n\nSo, first, let us introduce you to International Number Formats.\n\nWhat is the International Phone Number Format?\n\nThe international phone number format is a standardized way of writing a telephone number, and it is a globally recognized numbering plan for international telephone numbers. It is also known as the E.164 standard, which was established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to ensure consistent and reliable worldwide communication. Having learned that, now, let’s move on to the technical bits.\n\nWhat are the Components of International Phone Numbers?\n\nIn general, a typical international phone number consists of three main components. And to make it even simpler for you to get associated with all those elements, here is a breakdown of those:\n\nCountry Code: It is a unique prefix assigned to each country, usually ranging from one to three digits in length, which is used to identify the country to which a phone number belongs to.\n\nArea Code/NDC/Dialing Code: It is a three-digit number that is assigned to a specific geographic region within a country, which is used to distinguish between local and long-distance and then to route calls to the correct area. For example, 888 is the area code related to the toll-free number in North America.\n\nSubscriber Number(SN): It is the remaining set of digits representing the unique phone number of a specific subscriber or telephone within a country. Its length varies from country to country and is of the following types-\n\nMobile Numbers: These numbers are designed to be used on mobile phones and typically have a specific format that includes a Mobile Country Code (MCC), a Mobile Network Code (MNC), and then the subscriber’s number, making them usable across the designated country.\n\nTelephone Numbers: These numbers are directly assigned to landline phones and are used to make and receive calls within a specific geographic area. Their format varies depending on the country and are commonly known as Local numbers.\n\nToll-Free Numbers: Toll-free numbers are special phone numbers that can be dialed for free from any phone in a country and are typically used by businesses and organizations. Toll-free numbers typically have a specific format that starts with a specific prefix, such as “800” in the United States.\n\nAll these three components are joined to make a complete international number, which all together constitutes a maximum of 15 digits and is formatted as follows: [Country Code] + [National Destination Code] + [Subscriber’s Number].\n\nHere are some real-life examples of international phone numbers from different countries and regions.\n\nHow to Write US Phone Number in International Format?\n\nIn the United States, phone numbers are typically written in the format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX.

To make things easier, here are some Do’s, Don’ts, and some tips that you must follow as a traveler or business personnel any & all the time-\n\nDo’s:\n\nResearch Country Codes: Know the country code of the destination you’re calling. It’s like the secret handshake to get your call through.\n\nUse the ‘+’ Symbol: Start your number with the ‘+’ symbol, followed by the country code. This magical ‘+’ works across borders, making your call internationally friendly.\n\nDouble-Check Numbers: Precision matters. Recheck the number before hitting that dial button to avoid ending up in the wrong hemisphere.\n\nInclude Local Area Codes: Some countries require you to dial a city or area code before the local number. Be thorough, and include it.\n\nUnderstand Time Zones: Nobody likes a 3 AM wake-up call. Be mindful of the time zone differences and call at a reasonable hour.\n\nConsider the Receiver’s Time: If it’s a personal call, think about when the other person is likely to be available. Work calls during their lunch break might not be appreciated.\n\nDon’ts:\n\nAssume One Format Fits All: Different countries have different formats for phone numbers. Don’t assume a universal style—research and adapt.\n\nForget the Exit Code: If you’re dialing out from a different country, use the exit code of the country you’re in before dialing the international number. It’s the door out.\n\nIgnore Language Differences: If English isn’t the dominant language, make an effort to learn a few basic phrases or hire an interpreter. It’s a nice touch.\n\nRely Solely on Mobiles: While mobiles are convenient, sometimes landlines are the way to go. Check what’s more suitable for the country you’re dialing.\n\nSkip on Country-Specific Rules: Some countries have additional digits for special services or require a specific sequence for mobile numbers. Respect the local rules.\n\nAssume Your Phone Works Everywhere: Not all phones are created equal. Check if your phone is compatible with the local network or if you need a SIM card.\n\nAlso check out👉: How to Call International from USA\n\nSpecial Tips for Travelers and Business Professionals\n\nUse International Roaming or Local SIM Cards: Firstly, activate international roaming on your phone, and if not possible, consider getting yourself a local SIM card to avoid excessive charges and save some bucks.\n\nExplore Communication Apps: Secondly, try using VoIP communication apps like WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom, or Cloud-telephony services for cost-effective international calls or video conferences over Wi-Fi.\n\nHave Emergency Contacts Handy: When traveling to unexplored territories, make sure you have saved some important local and international emergency contacts in your phone for quick access. It can be the thing that saves your life.\n\nTest Your Connectivity: The last tip that you must follow all the time is to test your connectivity to avoid dropped calls or poor audio quality before even beginning to make a call.\n\nThe Wrap-up!\n\nBringing all the things together, in this blog, we highlighted everything about international phone number format and its components, discussed how to correctly write international phone numbers of some famous and well-known countries, and provided you with some crucial tips, do’s & don’ts to be always followed in any scenario.\n\nHowever, it is crucial for you, yourself, as a phone number user to be able to recognize and understand all the varying phone number formats across the world and to accurately write those.

You can find country codes online or in a phone book. Once you have the country code, follow these steps:\n\nTo begin, enter the country code, which is a 1 to 3-digit code prefixed by “+” or “00”.\n\nNext, add the local area code.\n\nFinally, enter the rest of your phone number. Make sure that you remove any preceding zeros from your number, and also note that the number of digits varies from country to country.\n\nFor example, if your phone number is (123) 456-7890 and you live in the United States, your international phone number would be +11234567890.\n\nAre all phone numbers 10 digits internationally?\n\nNo, not all phone numbers are 10 digits internationally. The length of a phone number can vary depending on the country. While the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has set a maximum length of 15 digits for international phone numbers, this means countries can use shorter numbers.\n\nAs an example, in the United States, the length of a phone number is seven digits, while in France, it is eight digits\n\nWhat is the proper format for a phone number?\n\nThe proper format for a phone number varies from country to country and the context in it is to be used. However, there are some general guidelines that you can research on and follow when dialing a phone number in an international format. Here is a general outline of a proper format for a phone number:\n\nInternational format: A plus sign (+) – country code – city code – local phone number(user’s number).\n\nLandline format: A 2-digit area code – a non-breaking space – the rest of the number in 2 chunks of 4 digits or altogether.\n\nMobile format: The mobile operator code- seven to ten digits for the main phone number.\n\nVanity format: Any combination of unique characters with separators, such as a space, dash, or period.\n\nWhat is the country exit code for USA?\n\nThe exit code for the United States is 011. When you are calling from the United States to another country, you must dial the exit code followed by the country code and the phone number. For instance, to make a call to a telephone number in the UK, you would have to dial 011+44+12345678."
