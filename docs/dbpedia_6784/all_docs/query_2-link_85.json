        "text": "In order to call India from the USA, you want to follow these following instructions, while remembering the major time difference between the two countries. In fact, Indian Standard Time (IST) is the time observed throughout India as well as Sri Lanka, and it’s important that you note that India doesn’t observe daylight saving time. You can check the current time in India using this site.\n\nIn order to call a landline in India follow this format: 011 + 91 + phone number\n\nThe numbers you’re dialing are the following:\n\n011 – the USA exit code, which needs to be dialed whenever you’re making an international call from the USA or Canada.\n\n91 – the Country Code for India.\n\nPhone Number – the landline number you wish to dial can’t begin with 0, and needs to include 10 digits. Remember to find out the Indian area code you need before dialing.\n\nIf you’re calling a landline in Mumbai from the USA, for example, your number should look like this:\n\n011 + 91 + 22 ???? ????\n\nCalling a mobile phone in India is different than calling a landline phone number. You’ll have to dial according to the following format: 011 + 91 + X? ???? ????\n\nX – will either be 7,8, or 9 depending on the cell number.\n\nViber Out Call Rates from 2.3¢ per Minute*\n\nYou may have figured out the ways to make a call from the USA to India, but truth be told they can take up a lot of your time, and if you plan on purchasing an India calling card from the USA, they can also be quite pricey.
