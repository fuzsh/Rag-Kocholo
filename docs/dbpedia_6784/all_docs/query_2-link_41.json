You can send faxes for as little as $0.07/€0.07/£0.04 per page, without any setup fees or monthly fees.\n\nInterfax is designed to be as similar to dialling your fax machine as possible. The principle is to specify a fax number as if you were dialling it from your standard phone. However, you may add access codes (long-distance, international), as well as country codes and area codes. In case no explicit access codes or prefixes are specified, Interfax will automatically add them according to your user settings.\n\nFor reading convenience, a fax number may contain any characters, such as hyphens, parentheses etc. Any non-digit character is ignored, with the exception of a plus sign, which is used as a generic International Access Code.\n\nFax numbers that contain brackets needs to be written as quoted string, see examples below.\n\nThe safest fax number format\n\nIf you are not sure what your user settings are, simply use the following standard international access notation:\n\n+(country code)(area code)(fax number)\n\nfor example: +1-212-9876543\n\nor +44-208-1234567\n\nOther international fax number examples\n\nExample 1:\n\nUser is configured to dial from New York, NY, USA.\n\nFaxing from US to UK:\n\nOption 1: +44 161 999 8888\n\nOption 2: \"011 44 (161) 999 8888\"\n\nNote that a US-based user (as defined in account defaults) can dial the US-specific international access code 011.\n\nUser wishes to send a fax to another area within the United States:\n\nOption 1: 1-408-999 8888\n\nOption 2: \"+1 (408) 999 8888\"\n\nUser wishes to send a fax to another phone number IN New York:\n\nOption 1: 222 8888\n\nOption 2: 1-212-222 8888\n\nOption 3: \"+1 (212) 222 8888\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nUser is configured to dial from London, UK.\n\nUser wishes to send a fax to another country (USA, with country code '1'):\n\nOption 1: +1 212 999 8888\n\nOption 2: \"001 (212) 999 8888\"\n\nNote that a UK-based user (as defined in account defaults) can dial the UK-specific international access code 00.\n\nUser wishes to send a fax to another area within the UK:\n\nOption 1: 0161 999 8888\n\nOption 2: \"+44 (161) 999 8888\"\n\nUser wishes to send a fax to another phone number IN London:\n\nOption 1: 2222 8888\n\nOption 2: 01-2222 8888\n\nOption 3: +44 1-2222 8888\n\nRegister\n\nRegister now to try our internet fax service.\n\nInterFAX Features and Benefits"
