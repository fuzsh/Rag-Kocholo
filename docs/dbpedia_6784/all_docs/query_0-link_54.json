        "text": "How to Use International Calling Codes\n\nThroughout the world, every country has a country code list that is unique, making it easy to place calls anywhere in the world to any other county. However, before you dial international calling codes, you need to notify the telephone system by including all the appropriate information.\n\nUnderstanding international Calling Codes\n\nThe international direct dial (IDD) designations are the international phone codes you add to international numbers. IDDs differ from one country to another. For example, to dial France from the United States and the United Kingdom, two different codes need to be added at the beginning of the international phone number.\n\nComposition of a country code list\n\nFor international calling codes, most countries have two-digit country codes. For instance, France's country code is 33, and the United Kingdom's country code is 44. The United States' country code is an exception, with just the code 1. Some smaller countries have three-digit international telephone codes, such as the Republic of Ireland's country code, which is 353.\n\nRepresentation of international phone codes\n\nSince you need to dial a range of IDDs to make international calls in the various countries, it is easier to use the plus (+) sign to represent the code rather than writing an international dialing codes with a zero (0) or double zero (00). That means a phone number in the UK might be written as +44 1296 999999.\n\nNational dialing codes when calling internationally\n\nIn several countries, you may need to add a zero (0) when dialing a number inside the same country. Depending on how you look at it, you might eliminate the zero (0) when placing a call. For example:\n\nTo dial a number in the United Kingdom, dial the internal area code (01296). The number would look like this: 01296 999999.\n\nTo call the same number from outside of the UK, it is not necessary to add the zero (0) before the area code. In this example, the number would be just 1296 999999. Then also include the country code with the number, making it 44 1296 999999.\n\nIf you want to dial the same number from France, for instance, you would need to dial double zero (00) first, as this is necessary for France to initiate an international phone call. Putting it all together, in this case, makes the phone number 00 44 1296 999999.\n\nPlacing an international call while studying abroad\n\nIf you have not travelled abroad before, or you are visiting a new country, placing a phone call home may get complicated. For example, if you are travelling from the United States and you are used to dialing 011 before the country code of an international call, you might be confused in Europe, where you dial double zero (00). If you are trying to call a number that is written as follows, it is most likely an international number:\n\n011 44 9999 999999\n\n00 44 9999 999999\n\n+44 9999 999999\n\nIf the number you want to call looks like one of these, it probably is not an international number, which means you do not need to add the country code at the beginning:\n\n6 999 999 999\n\n08 99 99 99 99\n\n01296 999 999\n\nMaking an international call\n\nTo summarize, when you want to place an international call:\n\nDial the IDD, which for majority of the world is 00 or 011.\n\nAdd the country code from the country code list.\n\nThen dial the target number, leaving off the first zero if there is one.\n\nIf you experience any problems or issues, just call the local operator and request help placing the call.\n\nList of International Calling Codes"
