        "text": "What Is a Business Phone Number?\n\nA business phone number, also known as direct inward dialing, is a number with no ties to a physical location, system, or device. It is often used for remote work and usually comes with a set of useful features meant to simplify your work and help you manage your business easily. It is used for communication with clients, partners, team members, and all business-related calls. Companies may also assign extensions to various departments and/or employees, which means your entire team can get business phone numbers. Though such numbers may be tied to a landline, most businesses opt for the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of virtual phone number providers. Virtual numbers allow employees to make and receive calls from any location and device with internet access.\n\nMightyCall Business Phone System\n\nTypes of Phone Number for Business\n\nLocal business phone numbers\n\nA local phone number is a number with a regional area code. Different states and different counties within the state have different area codes. Local numbers are best for companies that need a deeper level of trust and connection with the local community. For example, if your business is community-centered, such as a local store, service, or practice.\n\nToll-free business phone numbers\n\nToll-free numbers are phone numbers with a national area code, like 800, 855, etc. When callers dial this number, it’s free for them. Charges for toll-free calls are handled by the company. However, don’t worry about big bills. Most VoIP providers offer unlimited plans for toll-free calls, so all you pay is a monthly fixed price. If you have an online business, offer an online service, or do e-commerce, you need a business phone number like this that’s not tied to any specific region.\n\nVanity business phone numbers\n\nVanity phone numbers use a combination of letters and digits. For example, 1-800 FLOWERS is an example of a toll-free vanity number. 1(201) 455-CATS is an example of a local vanity option. Businesses opt for these numbers since they are great for advertising. As to dialing, they make use of the phone’s dial pad, which has letters associated with all digits, so they’re dialed just like any other normal phone number. These numbers work for any type of business.\n\nMightyCall’s toll-free numbers selection\n\nInternational business phone numbers\n\nInternational phone numbers are numbers that have an international country code and a local code. For example, +33 1 09 75 83 51 is an example of a French number. +33 is the country code, and 1 is the Paris area code. Businesses that have an international presence should get numbers that are specific to the countries they operate in. This makes calling accessible for customers from that particular region.\n\nChoose a Business Phone Number\n\nToll-free numbers\n\n1-800 toll-free working numbers work great for nationwide companies and/or those that want to encourage calls.\n\nLocal numbers\n\nConnect with your community. MightyCall offers company phone numbers for every area code in the U.S.\n\nVanity numbers\n\nTake the opportunity to brand your small business with a word or phrase so customers remember you better.\n\nInternational numbers\n\nAllow your customers to call your business from anywhere and make calls around the world at low prices.\n\nOnline phone numbers\n\nManage your calls over a Wi-Fi connection. On-the-go work has never been easier.\n\nVirtual phone numbers\n\nBuy a phone number for business and enjoy the full feature set without needing a second phone.\n\nInternet phone numbers\n\nWith an internet phone number, your small business will have better and easier access to every customer call.\n\nVoIP phone numbers\n\nGet better call coverage and dozens of virtual phone number features for less than your personal cell plan.\n\nBenefits Of Company Phone Numbers\n\nEnhance Retention\n\nVirtual telephone number systems typically include a large number of free features as part of the plan. These features will allow you to easily transfer calls from one team member to another and have text notes and recordings transcribed for all the conversations. This way, your team will be more efficient and will be able to retain more customers than without a company phone number.\n\nWork from Anywhere\n\nAs long as you have a stable internet connection, you and your teammates can work from anywhere. All you will need is a device with a system that supports the VoIP calling app. Any additional devices, such as headsets, are complementary and can be used at the user’s discretion. Work on the beach in Sri Lanka, in your favorite cafe downtown, at home, or in the office.\n\nEnjoy Affordability\n\nSince there is no need to install special equipment or invest in expensive hardware, all you will be paying is the same monthly or yearly service fee as regular office phone service, but you will get more features for that price. You will have a whole ecosystem that can be fully integrated into your work, purchase additional phone numbers for a cheaper price, and more.\n\nImprove Efficiency\n\nHave everything in one place, overview your call statistics, and see how each operator is performing. With the right provider, you will be able to effortlessly transfer calls between departments, have business hours, a multi-level IVR, a call waiting feature, and more. Company phone numbers make it easy for everyone.\n\nTypes of Business Telephone Number Providers\n\nVoIP providers\n\nThese provide online work phone numbers and are cloud-based because they do not rely on physical hardware. They are frequently more than just phone numbers, as they provide numerous features and can be used by large corporations, small businesses, and solopreneurs. Companies like Vonage and 8×8 fall into this category.\n\nFree business phone numbers\n\nLots of people wonder if you can get a new business number without having to pay for it. Some people want a stripped down service. They often turn to companies like Google Voice, which offer free numbers without many features. A free business number can have some obvious benefits, like the fact that you are not paying for it, but it can also have drawbacks, such as the fact that business numbers usually either don’t come with features or come with weak customer support.\n\nStandalone business numbers\n\nSome folks want to get themselves standalone business numbers when they get a business number. These standard phone numbers frequently lack features that can be used on desk phones or cellular devices. You can get business numbers like this through big companies like Verizon or Comcast. Even when it comes to these, though, you can get some variety by getting numbers like vanity phone numbers. Any number you use for your company will ultimately be your business number, so it’s important to make a good choice as to what kind you’d like.\n\nBusiness phone number apps\n\nSeveral companies base their phone systems around a downloadable app, oftentimes available for both iOS and Android devices. From this app, you can do a lot of things you can do with normal VoIP providers; you just have to centralize it through the app. Other companies, like MightyCall, base themselves around a web portal you can access on any computer while also offering an app to offer more flexibility.\n\nScale Your Business by Getting a Professional Phone Number\n\nThe best part about telephone numbers for business is the flexibility of choice they give you. Choose as few or as many numbers as you need. Start with one phone number, and as your organization and team grow, add more for additional employees, departments, or services.\n\nPort your number at any time when you want to switch phone companies without losing your brand identity. When you get a phone number for business from a reliable business-centric provider like MightyCall you have nothing to lose, and the whole (business) world to gain!"
