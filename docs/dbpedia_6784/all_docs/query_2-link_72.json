        "text": "This page outlines the process for creating a new template.\n\nCountry: submit sample\n\nTo launch its template development, the country contacts the S42 expert group by e-mail. The country's expert supplies a sample data set, which should consist of between 20 and 50 address examples representing all the address formats recommended by the postal operator.\n\nCountry and UPU: map addresses into elements\n\nEach address in the sample needs to be mapped into S42 elements reflecting their use in the country. For example, mapping the address line \"12 Main Street\" involves dividing it into 3 parts: \"12\", \"Main\", and \"Street\", and linking them to appropriate address elements as follows: \"12\" – street number; \"Main\" – thoroughfare name; \"Street\" – thoroughfare type.\n\nUPU: create a draft template based on mapped sample\n\nOn the basis of a mapped sample, the S42 expert group creates a template which is fed into a computer program known as a tester. This program reassembles each address from elements and checks the result against the submitted data. The test of the template is positive when all addresses from the sample have been assembled correctly.\n\nCountry: validate and approve template\n\nAt the end of the process, the country expert checks that:\n\nall addresses in the sample data set are properly formatted;\n\nthe sample contains a sufficiently complete representation of formats recommended by the country; and\n\nthe addresses are correctly mapped to S42 elements.\n\nUPU: publish template and deliver certificate\n\nThe template developed through this process is published in the next version of standard S42, and the country that developed the template is presented with a “S42 certificate of recognition” during one of the annual Postal Operations Council or Council of Administration sessions."
