        "text": "While you may prefer to be contacted by e-mail, many recruiters will want to speak to you personally, whether to clarify information or to conduct an initial phone interview. Here are some points to bear in mind.\n\nWrite your number in the correct format\n\nThe best approach to writing a phone number on your resume may differ depending on the country. To ensure clarity and avoid any potential dialing errors by recruiters, it is advisable to break down the number into smaller, easily readable segments. The most common practice is to enclose the area code in parentheses and insert a dash after the first three digits of your phone number. Alternatively, you can also separate the number using periods like this: 123.456.7890.\n\nThe right phone number can vary by country (see national conventions for writing phone numbers); however, here are a few tips:\n\nMobile numbers\n\nAs mobile phone numbers can be quite long, it’s best to break them up, so that there’s no chance of recruiters misdialling:\n\n07911 123456 (UK)\n\n086 123 1234 (Ireland)\n\n021 5678 4567 (New Zealand)\n\n06 4667 46678 (South Africa)\n\nLandline numbers\n\nWhen including a landline number, you also need to include the area code at the beginning of your number (in brackets so that it is clear that this is the area code) and break it up as follows:\n\n(020) 56756 467855 (UK; area code lengths vary according to region)\n\n(01) 437 4775 (Ireland; area code can be two or three numbers long)\n\n(09) 20 567 7996 (New Zealand; the first four or five digits indicate the region and area)\n\n(011) 978 4667 (South Africa)\n\nInternational dialling\n\nIf you’re located abroad or you have a foreign number, you will need to also include the international dialling code, e.g.\n\n+44 (UK)\n\n+ 353 (Ireland)\n\n+ 64 (New Zealand)\n\n+27 (South Africa)\n\nHowever, you can drop the initial digital of an area code or mobile phone number when listing your number in the international format, e.g.\n\n+44 76568 45748\n\nRegardless of the format, it’s also best practice to put a label in front of your phone number such as ‘Tel:’ or ‘M:’ (for mobile).\n\nUse our resume templates or CV templates to present your phone number in a professional manner together with other personal and professional information.\n\nNever give out your work number\n\nGiving out your work number to recruiters is risky as calls may be intercepted by colleagues or your current employer. If you’re not quite ready to share the news that you’re looking for a new job or that you’re planning on leaving the company, this can make for an awkward situation.\n\nTherefore, where possible, avoid listing your work number on your CV and include your mobile number.\n\nInclude your mobile number\n\nWhile it’s fine to include your landline number, a mobile phone does make you more accessible to recruiters who may work unconventional hours or need to reach you quickly.\n\nIn a competitive job market, candidates can be snapped up at a moment’s notice, so if a recruiter can’t reach you, they may take your lack of availability as a sign of disinterest and simply move onto the next availability market.\n\nOf course, if you don’t have a mobile phone number, then you can explain this in your cover letter and let them know when you can be reached on your landline number.\n\nAlternatively, you could set up a Google Voice or Skype account if you don’t feel comfortable giving out your phone number. The advantage of a Google Voice or Skype number is that you can answer incoming calls on multiple devices, e.g. your tablet, phone or computer.\n\nPreparing for calls from recruiters and employers\n\nIf you’ve included your phone number in your CV, you can expect recruiters and employers to call you rather than send an e-mail. This is because it’s a lot quicker for them to screen you over the phone than e-mailing back and forth. It’s also a way for them to gauge your phone manner and get a feel for your personality.\n\nHowever, if you have applied for multiple jobs, it can be hard to remember what you applied to and where. That’s why it’s a good idea to be prepared for calls by keeping a record of all job applications in a document that includes the job title, the company, the contact person and the stage of the application process (e.g. screening call received).\n\nThe last thing you want is to receive a call and to let on to recruiters that you’ve forgotten you’ve applied for the job.\n\nAn easier way to keep track of applications is by using an online CV builder. On Jobseeker, you can track your applications via the ‘Applications’ tab by adding notes and a status for each entry. This saves you from having to manually enter each job in an Excel or Word document.\n\nAnswering calls\n\nRecruiters’ calls can trigger mixed feelings. It may not be convenient to take the call if you’re in a noisy environment or you may just not be prepared. If you’re not too excited about the job you’ve applied for, the call may even trigger feelings of irritation or annoyance.\n\nWhatever your situation, honesty is the best policy.\n\nIf you’re unable to take the call at the moment, you can explain to recruiters that you’ll call them back once in a quieter spot.\n\nIf the latter situation applies to you, then you can let them know that you will call them back later to discuss your application or let them know straight away that you've decided to pursue other avenues, while thanking them for the opportunity.\n\nYou never know when you’ll need a recruiter, so it’s best to keep your tone friendly, conversational and polite.\n\nRecord a professional voicemail message\n\nIt’s natural that you won’t always be available to pick up calls, especially if you are in a full-time job while job-hunting. You may not want to take calls at work to avoid being overheard by colleagues or worse still, your boss. It’s also usual to screen calls if you want to avoid cold callers or prank calls.\n\nThis is perfectly understandable and most recruiters and employers will understand this. However, they will want to be reassured that they’re leaving messages for the right person. Therefore, it’s important to make sure that you set up a professional voicemail message which informs them who you are and when they can expect to hear from you.\n\nIn the same way as your CV and cover letter, your voicemail message should make a positive impression on recruiters. A clear and friendly voicemail greeting boosts your credibility and demonstrates your professionalism. A funny or unintelligible message, on the other hand, gives the impression that you’re not to be taken seriously and could make recruiters reconsider your application.\n\nHere are a few examples of voicemail messages for different scenarios:\n\nGeneral\n\n“Hi, you’ve reached the voicemail of [name]. Thanks for your call. I’m unavailable to take your call right now, but if you leave a message, I’ll call you back as soon as possible.”\n\nIf you are working, at school or otherwise occupied\n\n“Hi, you‘ve reached the voicemail of [name]. Thanks for your call. I’m unavailable to take your call between the hours of 09:00 and 18:00.\n\nIf you are calling in response to a job application that I submitted, please send me an e-mail at [e-mail address] so that I can respond more quickly. Otherwise, please leave a message with your name, phone number and the name of the business that you’re calling from. I will return your call during lunch or after 18:00. Thank you!”\n\nIf you’ve applied for multiple jobs"
