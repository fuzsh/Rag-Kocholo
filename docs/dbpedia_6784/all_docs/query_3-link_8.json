        "text": "If you wish to purchase a local SIM on arrival in Sri Lanka, you’ll need to first make sure that your phone is unlocked. There are many mobile providers in Sri Lanka but we recommend Dialog and Mobitel. Both of these providers offer tourist SIM packages with good 4G coverage in cities and major towns, which are valid for 30 days.\n\nThese SIMs come preloaded with credit and local calls in Sri Lanka are very cheap, usually around USD 0.01 per minute. The SIMs also come with either 1.5 or 3GB of data – see our page on internet access in Sri Lanka for more information."
