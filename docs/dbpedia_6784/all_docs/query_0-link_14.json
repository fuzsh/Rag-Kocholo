        "text": "Possible Scams Starting With +94\n\nUnfortunately, scam calls are widespread these days. According to one recent study, scammers have begun increasingly using social engineering tactics and advanced scripts to dupe their victims into believing they're real, making it harder than ever to tell if your call is genuine or not.\n\nIt should go without saying that, as a general rule, you should therefore remain careful when receiving calls, WhatsApps, or texts from unknown numbers. This applies to foreign telephone numbers with a +94 country code just as much as local numbers. And even though calls or messages from telephone numbers with a Sri Lankan dialing code might not always be a fraud attempt, you should always assume that they are if you have no connections to the country.\n\nBelow, we've listed a few of the most popular types of scam calls:\n\n1. Advance Fee Fraud\n\nIn an advance fee scam, someone calls you and tells you you're in line to receive a large sum of money. It all sounds so convincing. Maybe a rich distant relative has died, maybe you've won a cash prize, or maybe you're eligible for a government welfare payment. However, before you can receive the money, you're asked first to pay a fee or advance payment, which you must transfer quickly to unblock the larger sum you're owed. However, as you might've guessed, nothing is owed to you, and this was all a ploy to steal your money.\n\n2. Ping (or One-Ring) Calls\n\nPing calls are fraudulent phone calls that only ring briefly before being hung up. Here, you might feel tempted to call back out of curiosity or fear of missing an important call. If you do call back, high charges for international calling may follow, resulting in soaring costs on your phone bill. While scammers often use this trick to test the validity of your phone number for future scams, it's often done purely out of malice or just to annoy you.\n\n3. Fake Job Offers\n\nIf you receive a call for a job you didn't apply for, you're probably receiving a fake job offer. Here, you'll be offered an attractive position and salary, but you'll be asked to provide your personal information or even pay for your training, equipment, or visa applications. However, these scams will ultimately leave you without money and without a job.\n\n4. Phishing Attacks\n\nPhishing attacks are widespread and involve sending fake emails or text messages pretending to come from a trusted source, often a bank, delivery service, or insurance company. These messages often contain links to fake websites where you'll be tricked into revealing personal details such as passwords or credit card information. These fake websites can often look very elaborate and accurate, making it easy to be fooled.\n\n5. Romance Scams\n\nAs the name suggests, romance scams involve a fake romantic relationship. The scammer gains their victim's trust with the sole intention of extorting money by pretending to be in a difficult situation and needing financial help. Although it might sound obvious to spot, scammers will often be very persuasive, building your trust over a long period of time and having an elaborate (albeit fake) life story and attractive pictures. In extreme cases, the scammer will even take you on real dates in person and show off their apparent wealth long before asking you for any money.\n\n6. Technical Support Scam\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be employees of a technology company or an IT support service and call you claiming to want to help fix alleged problems with your computer or device. Step by step, they'll ask you unwittingly to grant them remote access to your computer, where they'll proceed to steal your personal data or install malware.\n\n7. Police Fraud Scams\n\nYou're called by the police. They explain that you (or often a close relative of yours) are about to be arrested for a crime. The only way to escape being thrown into jail is to pay a bail or court fee in advance. They arrange to meet you in a public area to accept the cash (where they'll be dressed as cops), or, preferably, they'll receive the payment as a bank transfer or as a digital payment. The problem is, none of this is real, and the 'police' were merely professional scammers impersonating police officers.\n\nHow to Protect Yourself From Scam Calls\n\nIf you're feeling sure that you don't know anyone in Sri Lanka who might want to contact you with a legitimate request, you should be aware of your options.\n\nOption 1: Ignore\n\nIf you're just being called or texted from an unknown telephone number with a +94 country code, you can ignore it for the time being. It may turn out that someone is contacting you legitimately and that you lack the context to categorise the message or call. However, it's important that you don't engage. Don't open attachments that you receive via WhatsApp or other messengers from an unknown telephone number Sri Lanka or from unknown local numbers. The risk of downloading a virus onto your phone is high.\n\nOption 2: Block\n\nIf you receive regular calls or messages from an unknown phone number with or without a +94 country code, you should block it. WhatsApp contacts can be blocked directly via the WhatsApp app, and you can block regular calls via your ‘Phone’ app too. (The steps required for this vary depending on whether you have an iPhone or Android, but blocking contacts is generally easy on all smartphones.)\n\nOption 3: Report\n\nAre you regularly terrorised by scam calls, or have you fallen victim to one? Then you should report the telephone number to the relevant authority in your country. Although the authorities cannot always do something directly to prevent this, especially in the case of foreign numbers with +94 prefixes or other dialing codes, your report can initiate or support an investigation.\n\nBelow are a few official resources for reporting scams in various countries which would be a good place to start:"
