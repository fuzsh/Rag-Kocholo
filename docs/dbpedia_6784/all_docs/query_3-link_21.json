        "text": "Internet speed for cell phones and fixed network\n\nWith an average download speed of 22.51 Mbit/second for fixed-network broadband internet, Sri Lanka ranks 138th in an international comparison. The upload rate of only 6.9 Mbit/second was significantly lower (158th place).\n\nIn mobile internet, i.e., on tablets and smartphones, Sri Lanka comes 122nd with a download speed of 18.53 Mbit/second. The upload speed of around 7 Mbit was only enough for 133rd place.\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index published regularly by Ookla is based on several million individual measurements in April 2024 from 181 countries.\n\nMobile phone rates in Sri Lanka\n\nEvery year, the International Telecommunication Union calculates for many countries what a mobile phone contract costs to use. A monthly budget averaging US$ 2.50 was calculated Sri Lanka in 2022. Compared to the previous year, this amount has fallen by 42 percent.\n\nThe ITU refers to the costs for monthly use and includes 140 telephony minutes, 70 text messages and a data transfer of 2 GBytes. The transfer speed should be the minimum of a 3G connection, i.e. at least UMTS, which is already outdated in many parts of the world. 2 GBytes do not sound much. However, this is already quite a high consumption in a worldwide comparison. If one does not take a fixed amount in US dollars, but converts it to the economic output per inhabitant, a user in Sri Lanka spends 0.74% of his income on mobile telephony. Worldwide, this rate is around 5.4 percent.\n\nIn the USA, the monthly cost was around $44.10.\n\nThe following diagrams show the development of the various telephone and internet connections as a percentage of the country's population. Values above 100 percent mean that, on average, every inhabitant has more than one connection.\n\nAccess to the internet in Sri Lanka from 1994 - 2021\n\nBroadband internet in Sri Lanka 2001 - 2022\n\nSri Lanka is lagging behind in the expansion of broadband internet connections. Around 44 percent of all residents have access to the internet. Around 10 percent have their own fast internet connection, which is at least faster than the former ISDN (more than 256 kbit/s). All fixed connections via DSL, cable or satellite were counted here, but not those connected to the internet via mobile communications.\n\nLandlines 1990 - 2022\n\nMobile phones 1990 - 2022\n\nThe increasing prevalence of cell phones and the simultaneous decline in the number of fixed-network phones also indicate a change here. While the number of fixed-network phones has declined over the past few years, the number of cell phones has increased noticeably at the same time. Most recently, there were 141 cell phone contracts per 100 people. This trend can be observed worldwide, but is not yet as pronounced in Sri Lanka as in some other countries.\n\nâ–º All international calling codes"
