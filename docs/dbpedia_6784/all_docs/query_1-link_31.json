        "text": "When calling a phone number in another country, there is usually a prefix you have to dial to indicate that you're placing an international call (so that the number isn't confused with a domestic number starting with the same digits); this varies by country, although on mobile phones you usually can use \"+\" instead. After this international dialling prefix, you must dial the country code for the country you are calling, followed by the local number (including any area prefixes, often with the first digit removed). This is a list of those country codes.\n\nThe country code is usually included in the fact box (\"quickbar\") in the beginning of country articles. Both it and the international dialling prefix are usually told also in the Connect section of the country article.\n\nThe entities that are within the North American Numbering Plan – the United States and its possessions, Canada, Bermuda, and several Caribbean nations — share the international \"country\" code 1, with each state (or parts of states), province, territory, or island nation given its own three-digit \"area code\". The following list includes the area code for such nations and possessions.\n\nInternational prefix\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore dialling the country code, you usually have to dial an international prefix. This is so that the country code won't be confused with the first few digits of a local or national telephone number. On mobile phones \"+\" is usually automatically substituted by the international prefix. Here is a list of common international prefixes:\n\nDigits dialledCountries you are calling from 00 All European Union countries, plus Afghanistan, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Georgia, India, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Moldova, Nepal, New Zealand, North Korea, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Vietnam, Yemen 000 Tanzania, Uganda 001 Cambodia, Guyana, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Mongolia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand 0011 Australia 002 Paraguay, Taiwan 009 Colombia, Nigeria 010 Japan 011 All North American Numbering Plan countries 0021 Brazil (The Brazilian international prefix is 00- followed by a two-digit carrier code) 810 Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan 119 Cuba\n\nOn a mobile phone, you can instead dial the '+' key before the country code, regardless of which country you are calling from.\n\nThis travel topic about List of country calling codes is an outline and needs more content.
