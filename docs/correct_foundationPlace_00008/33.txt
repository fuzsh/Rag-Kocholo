SAP is the market leader in enterprise application software – enterprise resource planning software, data analytics, cloud based solutions, database integration, and mobility management. SAP software supports organizations of all sizes and industries by developing innovations that help customers run at their best. “From back office to boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device – SAP empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of competitors.” (SAP Fact Sheet, April 2015).

SAP AG is headquartered in Waldorf Germany. The company was founded in 1972 by individuals that recognized the importance of organizations having a single set of data for processing transactions.

This is still the backbone of SAP software. Salisbury University is fortunate to be just a few hours from the SAP America headquarters in Newtown PA.
