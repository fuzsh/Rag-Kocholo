As a partner to Mannheim companies, we fully support you with our ideas, knowledge, experience and the best contacts to ensure that you achieve success in the business location of Mannheim.

A detailed overview can be found in the ‘Economic development services’ section. Or visit us during our business clinic if you have any pressing matters that need to be addressed. You’ll be able to talk directly to the Deputy Mayor during this time. Of course, Wirtschaftsförderung Mannheim is available to assist you every day.

Funding - an important topic for many companies. Find out about our KREATECH programme. Or subscribe to our ‘Facts and factors’ newsletter which also provides information on our current funding programmes.

And if you want to register or deregister a business or notify a change in a business address, just contact the Department for Public Safety and Order.
