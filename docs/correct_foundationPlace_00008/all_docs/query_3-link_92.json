Reshape Tomorrow’s Energy.\n\nAt Westinghouse, our mission is to help the world address the challenge of a changing climate by enabling public utilities and local governments to deliver clean, safe, reliable and carbon-free energy. To achieve that mission, we are committed to nurturing our two most inexhaustible sources of potential. The first, of course, is nuclear energy. The second is the collective talents of the people who work here.\n\nThat’s where you come in. While we currently employ 9,000 extraordinary people in 19 countries across the globe, we’re always in search of those select individuals who want to maximize their professional skills, initiative and creativity while striving to make a genuine difference in the world.\n\nDoes that describe you? If so, we invite you to explore career opportunities with Westinghouse and to consider joining our quest to confront what may be the most compelling test of our time – the need to reimagine, renew and reshape the way we generate tomorrow’s energy."
