        "text": "SAP explained simply\n\nSAP – Where does the term come from?\n\nIn 1972, five IBM employees quit their jobs and set up their own company in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg. The company was founded by Hasso Plattner, Hans-Werner Hector, Dietmar Hopp and Clas Neumann.\n\nThe idea is digital software for real-time payroll accounting. Which should replace the then common punch card system forever. This is the starting signal for system analysis and program development GbR – abbreviation SAP. Today, according to Wikipedia, the abbreviation stands for “systems, applications and products in data processing”. Originally known as SAP R/2, the software has evolved over time and is now available in the form of S/4HANA, which is next-generation ERP software.\n\nIn the early years, the products were well received by the market. This leads to steady growth and increasing sales. Due to its success, the company dares to go public in 1988. In the 1990s, the company managed to increase its turnover tenfold. This is partly due to the introduction of SAP R/3, which lays the foundation for today’s SAP products.\n\nAfter the turn of the millennium, SAP takes over numerous well-known corporations. These include companies such as TechniData, Success Factors or Concur Technologies. Today, more than 91,000 employees work for the company. Today, SAP generates annual sales of more than $22 billion.\n\nAccording to a study by the auditing firm PwC, SAP is the most valuable company in Germany. According to this definition, a market value of more than 100 billion euros means number one in 2018, ahead of Siemens. Together with Microsoft, IBM, Google and Oracle, the company from Walldorf is one of the largest software manufacturers in the world. SAP is a global leader in enterprise software, including ERP software used by organizations to manage their business processes.\n\nAll-in-one ERP solution for all company sizes\n\nWhy it’s worth switching to an SAP system\n\nSAP ERP enables the administration and presentation of all business processes within a system. From accounting, through controlling, to production and warehousing.\n\nAround 335,000 customers worldwide rely on the Walldorf-based Group’s technology. These include global players such as Coca Cola, Gazprom and Siemens. SAP SE is the largest software manufacturer in Europe and one of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nThe system has developed into the cross-industry software standard. Around 70 percent of global economic output runs through SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).\n\nIn order to represent the interests of the users, separate associations have been created. The so-called user groups.\n\nBy implementing a single standard software, many processes can be automated. Manual entries are reduced to a minimum. In addition to the main product SAP ERP, which primarily serves enterprise resource planning, the company has developed additional modules over the years to cover other divisions and processes.\n\nSAP Ariba Supplier Risk is an innovative supplier management program. Marketing activities can be recorded very well with the SAP Marketing Cloud. With SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, the provider also provides a special tool for human resources.\n\nSAP Modules and Applications\n\nWhile most software providers today rely on SaaS solutions that are provided via cloud service, SAP presents a so-called on-premise system. It is installed locally on the user’s server. The following modules are available for you with an SAP ERP system:\n\nFI = Finance\n\nCO = Controlling\n\nTR = Treasuring\n\nEC = Enterprise Controlling\n\nIM = Investment Management\n\nPS = Project System\n\nWF = Workflow\n\nECM = Enterprise Controlling Management\n\nIS = Industry Solutions\n\nSD = Sales Distribution\n\nMM = Materials Management\n\nPP = Production Planning\n\nQM = Quality Management\n\nPM = Plant Maintenance\n\nHCM = Human Capital Management\n\nBW = Business Warehouse\n\nCRM = Customer Relation Management\n\nFS = Financial Solutions\n\nGet the most out of SAP solutions\n\nDue to the wide range of functions of SAP ERP software and SAP S/4Hana, many companies find it difficult to exploit the full potential of their solution. Often the time and know-how to implement the system correctly is lacking.\n\nWe at Munich Enterprise solve this problem with an extensive consulting offer. On request, we can help you adapt the different modules to your requirements.\n\nAmong other things, we use the ABAP component for this. This is an in-house programming language of SAP. This enables individual coding and function extensions.\n\nIn addition, we support our customers with useful add-ons to supplement and expand the technical capabilities of SAP software. SAP Mail is particularly noteworthy here, as it allows you to manage and send e-mails from within the SAP system.\n\nWould you also like to switch to SAP’s ERP systems?\n\nThen contact us now.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSwitch to SAP Mail\n\nThe benefits and what to look out for\n\ntransparent presentation of all company processes\n\nA wide range of automation options\n\nSaving time and resources\n\nmanual inputs are reduced to a minimum\n\nGood usability\n\nDespite the many advantages, you should bear in mind that a change cannot happen overnight and that a certain amount of time should be taken into account.\n\nAs a rule, it takes a while for the new processes and systems to be accepted and internalized by all employees.\n\nWir von munich enterprise helfen Ihnen, diese Phase der Umstrukturierung zu planen und stressfrei zu überbrücken. We look forward to hearingfrom you ."
