        "text": "Here’s the complete list of SAP ERP components (SAP ERP modules).\n\nFrom Controlling to Occupational Health to Waste Management.\n\nSo if you want the full list of SAP ERP modules, then you’re in the right place.\n\nLet’s go!\n\nSAP ERP modules made simple (SAP ERP components)\n\nImagine SAP ERP modules (now SAP components) as building blocks for SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, such as:\n\nSAP R/3 (SAP Real-Time Tier 3)\n\nSAP ECC (SAP ERP Central Component)\n\nSAP S/4HANA (SAP Business Suite 4 SAP HANA)\n\nA company picks the building blocks to integrate into their SAP ERP system that it needs and leaves out the ones that aren’t needed.\n\nEach building block provides technology to run other building blocks or functionality for a specific purpose such as:\n\nFinance\n\nHuman Resources\n\nLogistics\n\nSAP ERP modules allow you to break your SAP ERP system into simpler and more manageable parts.\n\nSAP NetWeaver is both the technical foundation for the building block and a building block.\n\nAlthough SAP ERP modules are now called SAP ERP components (since 2004 with the SAP R/3 upgrade to SAP ECC), for the sake of the old days and because modules sound more neat than components (don’t you think so too—leave a comment), let’s just call them SAP ERP modules.\n\nFirst, let’s look at the difference between technical and functional SAP ERP modules:\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules vs. functional SAP ERP modules\n\nSAP ERP modules come in two flavors:\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules\n\nFunctional SAP ERP modules\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules make up the technical foundation of an SAP ERP system.\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules are needed to integrate the functional SAP ERP modules.\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules contain no logic but serve as the environment for running functional SAP ERP modules.\n\nTwo technical SAP ERP modules are mandatory:\n\nSAP NetWeaver\n\nSAP ABAP\n\nFunctional SAP ERP modules\n\nFunctional SAP ERP modules are building blocks that contain the processes and logic of specific business areas.\n\nFunctional SAP ERP modules extend an ERP system with functionality for certain business areas.\n\nFor example, three functional SAP ERP modules are:\n\nCO (Controlling)\n\nFI (Financial Accounting)\n\nPM (Plant Maintenance)\n\nSAP ERP submodules\n\nSAP ERP modules are further divided into SAP ERP submodules.\n\nSAP ERP submodules provide additional functionality in the business area of their parent.\n\nFor example, the SAP ERP module SAP PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) offers the SAP ERP submodules:\n\nBasic Data for Process Manufacturing\n\nClassification\n\nDocument Management\n\nEngineering Change Management\n\nEnterprise Content Management\n\nSAP ERP modules vs. software modules\n\nEven though SAP ERP modules are software, they are not software in a computer science sense in terms of programming.\n\nIn computer science, a software module is a functional and self-contained unit of software consisting of processing steps and data structures.\n\nThough SAP ERP modules have processing steps and data structures.\n\nBut SAP ERP modules are not functional and self-contained units. Since the functions of SAP ERP modules are intertwined or they rely on each other.\n\nOperating an SAP ERP module always affects other SAP ERP modules.\n\nTherefore, SAP ERP modules are not self-contained and are no software modules in terms of computer science.\n\nMaybe this is the reason because SAP changed the name from modules to components to differentiate more clearly between SAP ERP modules and software modules in a computer science way.\n\nThe complete SAP ERP modules list (324)\n\nFirst, an overview of:\n\nThe technical SAP ERP modules\n\nThe functional SAP ERP modules\n\nFollowing is the complete SAP ERP modules list including all SAP ERP modules and their submodules.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nTechnical SAP ERP modules (5)\n\nHere’s the complete list of all technical SAP ERP modules:\n\nABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming)\n\nBasis\n\nBI (Business Intelligence)\n\nCA (Cross-Application Components)\n\nNW (NetWeaver)\n\nFunctional SAP ERP

Management\n\nMarket Risk Management\n\nTreasury Management\n\nThere you go!\n\nSome SAP ERP modules explained\n\nHere are a few SAP ERP modules explained:\n\nSAP FICO (SAP Finance and SAP Controlling)\n\nSAP FICO helps an organization manage its financial data. SAP FICO enables organizations to keep an up-to-date version of their financials.\n\nSAP FICO in particular is designed to help companies create and maintain financial statements for analysis and reporting, as well as to assist with effective business planning and decision-making.\n\nSAP FICO is comprised of two parts:\n\nSAP FI (Finance): handles overall financial reporting and accounting\n\nSAP CO (Controlling): focuses on cost planning and monitoringSAP FI and SAP CO used to be two separate modules, but now they’re so tightly integrated that they’re just talked about as one module.\n\nSAP HCM (SAP Human Capital Management)\n\nSAP HCM is used for recruiting, managing and developing employees.\n\nHCM focuses on human resources as assets that need to be invested in and managed so they’re maximizing their business value.\n\nHCM is more than HR’s administrative functions and includes such strategic roles as talent management and employee engagement.\n\nHCM also refers to the software that’s used to automate processes like development, management, and recruitment.\n\nSAP MM (SAP Materials Management)\n\nSAP MM allows companies to manage materials, inventory, and warehouses.\n\nSAP MM’s primary goal is to ensure the organization’s supply chain is always stable by ensuring material is kept in proper quantities and without shortfalls or gaps.\n\nSAP MM also makes it possible for supply chain professionals and other SAP users to complete their purchases more quickly, and in a cheaper and more efficient manner, and to keep up with changes in these processes.\n\nSAP MM is a part of logistics, and it helps manufacturers with their supply chains.\n\nSAP PM (SAP Production Maintenance)\n\nSAP PM helps companies maintain and support their equipment and systems.\n\nSAP PM has three components to help with maintenance:\n\nInspections: determines the actual condition of the system or equipment.\n\nPreventive maintenance: helps ensure optimal conditions for systems or equipment.\n\nRepair: supports the restoring of systems or equipment.\n\nSAP PM lets you handle your maintenance requests and take care of some of the repairs automatically.\n\nYou can use it to log problems, keep track of labor and expenses, and record and settle your costs.\n\nSAP PM automatically triggers processes in the other modules when needed.\n\nFor instance, a repair activity may trigger a purchase order for a material in MM or purchasing.\n\nSAP PP (SAP Production Planning and Control)\n\nSAP PP helps businesses plan the manufacturing, sale and distribution of goods.\n\nAs part of logistics, SAP PP plays an important part in a manufacturer’s supply chains.\n\nSAP PP includes:\n\nBill of material\n\nCapacity planning\n\nMaterial requirements planning\n\nRoutings\n\nWhat makes SAP PP tick is master data that is manipulated and stored in centralized master data tables.\n\nData in the master table is used to create transactional data, for example:\n\nCreating a purchase order in MM\n\nCreating a production order in PP\n\nCreating a sales order in SD\n\nExample: The SAP PP production order will use master data from SAP MM to determine the raw materials needed, which will then be used to create the SAP SD sales order.\n\nSAP PS (SAP Project System)\n\nSAP PS is a project management tool that lets users direct funds and resources where they’re needed, and control each stage of a project to make sure it’s timely and doesn’t break the budget.\n\nSAP PS enables project managers to set start and end dates of their projects and break them down into discrete elements and structures.\n\nWith a work breakdown structure, projects are broken down into individual tasks and linked together hierarchically, and then by processes.\n\nAs a result, work packages are created, which includes activities and their details, like dates of start and ends.\n\nAdditionally, the network function lets you set up relationships between different activities.\n\nSAP QM (SAP Quality Management)\n\nSAP QM helps you prevent defects, make continuous process improvements, and ensure quality throughout the organization.\n\nBenefits to the organization include:\n\nCompliance with manufacturing quality regulations\n\nImproved customer service\n\nReduced costs\n\nAs with any SAP ERP module, SAP QM interacts with other SAP ERP modules.\n\nSAP QM’s main focus is quality control processes that organizations use to ensure the quality of goods through their product life cycle: inspecting goods as they enter a facility, getting them through production, and finally delivering them as finished products.\n\nSAP SD (SAP Sales and Distribution)\n\nSAP SD manages customer- and product-related data. A company uses this data to:\n\nBilling\n\nInvoicing of its goods and services\n\nManage sales ordering\n\nShipping\n\nTogether with other SAP modules, SAP SD forms the foundation of an order-to-cash business process.\n\nSAP SD deals with all the sales and distribution in the order-to-cash process.\n\nThe typical operation of the business is that SD generates a sales quote > the customer orders the goods > delivered by warehousing or production > an invoice is sent with the order > and payment is made by accounts receivable.\n\nEach step in the process causes transactions in the SD module, which causes further transactions in the other EPR modules.\n\nFor example, when a sales order is generated in SD, it links to the product availability check in MM, and a credit check in FICO, and the tax calculations in FICO."
