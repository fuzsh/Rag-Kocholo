        "text": "About the Mercedes-Benz Mannheim plant\n\nMercedes-Benz and Mannheim are linked by a very special history. On January 29, 1886 this is where engineer Carl Benz invented the world’s first automobile with the patent number 37435 – the Benz Patent Motor Car. What is now the Mercedes-Benz Mannheim plant was founded first in Luzenberg, Mannheim-Waldhof in 1908. At this facility more than 4,800 employees produce engines and associated components for all of Daimler Trucks' commercial vehicle divisions around the world.\n\nThe plant's foundry is one of the world's leading producers of cast-iron vehicle components. Engines are also prepared for commercial vehicles and passenger cars at the \"European Center for Reconditioned Engine Production\".\n\nIn addition, the Competence Center for Emission-Free Mobility (KEM) has been accompanying drives of the future of all vehicle divisions from prototype to series for more than 25 years.\n\nTraining and securing young talent are also of equal importance for the Mannheim location: With more than 100 years of experience, young people are trained at the site - in total, more than 11,000 young people have completed their training here.\n\nDaimler Truck AG at a glance\n\nWelcome to the Daimler Truck AG, the pioneer of commercial vehicles.\n\nWe founded the modern transportation industry with our trucks and buses more than 120 years ago.
