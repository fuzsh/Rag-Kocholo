Since 2004, the initiative has made it its mission to spread the startup spirit in the Rhine-Neckar region and among the students of the University of Mannheim and to pave the way for the now more than 250 members to start their own business. Many thinc! members have already successfully founded their own startup. This goal is achieved through numerous offers: Founder Talks with successful founders from all over Germany take place once a week. In addition, thinc! offers its members interesting workshops on the topic of founding, the students have the opportunity to visit startups from the region as well as in Berlin and, of course, can pursue their own startup projects. In doing so, they always find support from thinc! and its wide network.
