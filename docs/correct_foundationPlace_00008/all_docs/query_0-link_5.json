The first National Convention of Ce¬ ment Users convened at Indianapolis January 17th and after a three-day ses¬ sion adjourned to meet at Milwaukee, Wis., in January, 1906. The session was remarkable for its enthusiasm and broad intelligence, which clearly indicated that it was com¬ posed of men of affairs, who had met to discuss the various applications of Portland cement concrete on broad, practical lines, based upon individual experience. The papers read were as a rule not first class. Several of these papers were positively bad, tending to promote unsound methods, which were corrected by the criticism leveled at them in the discussions by individual members, who were quick to puncture ail that was faulty and unsound, there¬ in' keeping the discussions within sound and practical lines at all times. Questions were repeatedly fired at speakers asking for definite informa¬ tion on the subject under discussion. An answer was always given which, on the whole, was to the point and satis¬ factory to the questioner. The Con¬ vention at times became a veritable experience meeting in which sound ideas were liberated that will do much to insure a greater uniformity of prac¬ tice in all concrete construction work in the future. The members attending this conven¬ tion freely expressed themselves on this point, saying that they had as indi¬ viduals been more than repaid for the expense incurred in attending the con¬ vention. Every concrete worker should attend these conventions and thereby profit by the vast fund of useful information which is dispensed on every subject which comes up in .his daily practice during the active season of construc¬ tion. It will be money in his pocket so to do. Come to the next Milwaukee convention and you will not regret it. It will place you in touch with the latest wrinkles and practice in the working and handling of concrete to obtain good and uniformly sound work. The convention was a success throughout, especially in the large number of concrete workers and cement machinery men in attendance, some¬ thing over 590 men signing the roll of membership. Great credit is due to the officials of “Municipal Engin¬ eering” for conceiving and organizing the convention in the first instance, The organization as it exists to-day stands upon broad, independent lines controlled by no clique or clan, but represents the honest expression of a clear majority of the members assem¬ bled at Indianapolis, with a mission to infuse life and sound practice into the concrete worker’s art. A list of offi¬ cers elected will be found on another page. _____ THE NORTHWESTERN CONCRETE PRODUCTS CONVENTION. The above named convention held at Minneapolis January 24, 25, 26 and 27, was largelv attended, over 360 persons names appearing on the roll of mem¬ bership. O. W. Miracle was chosen president; F. II. Chapin, secretary; John M. Hazen, treasurer. Several papers were read. Particular pains were observed to impress the names of newspapers which appeared on the roster of the convention. When the roster was printed, some of the exhib¬ itors complained of excessive charges for space, compared with the charges exacted for the same space by the Lumberman’s exhibit which succeeded tl’.e Concrete Products exhibit, which was three-fifths less than that exacted by the Concrete Products convention. In calling attention to this discrimina¬ tion we simply voice the sentiments of the numerous exhibitors. The con¬ vention was a success from every point of view.

MATERIALS WHICH RETARD THE SETTING OF PORTLAND CEMENT. By R. C. Carpenter. Portland cement, when mixed with water, has two properties pertaining to the hardening process which are essentially similar in many respects but differ in quality and characteristics to such an extent that they have received different names. The one property, t hat marks the preliminary process during which the mortar becomes pasty and brittle, is termed the “set¬ ting, the other, which is slow, long continued and permanent, the “hardening.” In accordance with in¬ vestigations of Le Chatelier, the “setting” is due to the formation of saturated solution of alumina compounds as aluminate of lime and similar compounds from which crystals are deposited with great rapidity in the case of rapid setting cements and at a less rapid rate with those which set slowly. The hardening process which takes place later is largely due to the formation of crystals of silica compounds as trisili¬ cate of lime which are interlaced writh cyrstals of other compositions. In many instances the setting, which is the initial process of hardening, takes place so rapidly as to present practical difficulties in the proper gauging and use of the cement. To overcome these difficulties it has been customary for many years in the manu¬ facture of Portland cement, to mix with the cement some material which would retard the formation of the crystals of aluminate of lime and similar compounds and thus regulate the time of setting. For this purpose gypsum (sulphate of lime, CaS04) has been principally used. The effect of adding gyp¬ sum is only temporary provided the cement is ex¬ posed to the air, and for that reason other materials have been sought for. The present article gives a brief description of some experiments made in the Mechanical Laboratory in 1904 by Walter H. Kinskern and William L. Gass, for the purpose of determining the regulating power on the cement of gypsum and chloride of calcium (CaCl2). For the purposes of the experiment, one of the large Portland cement works supplied us with clinker which had not been treated and which in its normal condi¬ tion made a remarkably quick setting cement. This clinker was ground in a pebble mill owned by the laboratory under conditions which permitted the ad¬ dition of the various materials to be tested. Influence on Time of Setting of Cement Mixed With Sulphate of Lime (Gypsum.) The following shows in tabular form the results of adding different amounts of gypsum, the gypsum be¬ ing proportioned by weight, as indicated in the first column of the table. In these experiments the time of initial set is taken in every case as the time when a pat of the cement made by mixing with the percentage of water shown, would bear a rod with diameter of 1-12- in. carrying a weight of 1-4 lb. The time of final set is that time which has elapsed since mixing when the pat will bear a rod 1-24 in. in diameter carrying a weight of 1 lb. This method of determining the set, although commonly used, depends to some little extent upon the judgment of the operator and as would nat¬ urally be expected gives results which are somewhat irregular although sufficiently accurate for purposes of comparison. 1 The results of the trials referred to with gypsum show that 1 1-2 per cent produces the maximum effect in retarding the set, and that for the special samples tested no beneficial results were obtained by the use of a large amount. The following table shows the retardation of the set due to using different quantities of gypsum : Per Cent Per Cent Initial Set. Final Set. CaSOq.

I hus E. Candlot, in his work “Ciments et chaux hy- drauliques” gives the results of adding different quan¬ tities of gypsum to three specimens of cement, the results showing in each case an increase in retardation cf set nn to 2 per cent, and in one instance up to 4 per cent. His experiments were as follows: Quantity Time of Setting in Fresh Water. of Gypsum 1 2 3 added Initial Fi nal Initial Final Initial Final per ^ent h m h m h m h m h m h m .0 0 7 0 22 0 7 O 15 0 2 0 5 •5 0 50 2 43 4 10 0 17 0 2 0 5 1. 00 2 40 4 50 3 50 5 1 30 2 35 i-5 2 57 5 17 3 50 5 3 20 5 15 2.0 3 5 20 4 20 6 45 4 7 3-o 3 6 40 3 45 / 5 7 4.0 3 30 7 5 7 5 7 In the above table it is noted that the extremely rapid setting cement, No. 3, had a maximum retarda¬ tion when 2.0 per cent of gypsum was added, when a larger amount was added there was no effect on the time of setting. With the slowest setting specimen, the retardation increased as the amount of gypsum was increased to 4 per cent, although the increase was slight after 3 per cent had been added. The experi¬ ments show no decrease in time of the final set due to an increase in the amount of gypsum up to 4 per cent. As showing the temporary effect of gypsum in reg¬ ulating the set, the following experiments are quoted from Candlot. when Portland cement is mixed with fresh water: The above tests were made when the cement was exposed to the action of the air. It is noted that in two cases a long time test showed a return of the re¬ tarding action of the gypsum on the cement, although CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. it is not certain that this might not have been due to some other cause. Candlot kept Portland cement mixed with 2 per cent of gypsum in a very close bin with the following results : Time of Set. Initial Final h m h m Trial made the day of mixture . 3 o 6 25 Trial made after one month . 2 50 5 Trial made after two months . 1 30 7 Trial made after five months . o 10 o 18 The addition of small quantities of sulphate of lime increases the strength for all cases except when the cement is immersed in sea water and the proportion of sulphate is greater than 2 per cent; for this last case the briquettes soon show traces of alteration and in time completely disintegrate. The experiments quoted are conclusive in showing that there is little or no advantage gained in adding more sulphate of lime than 2 per cent, and I believe that it would not be an unreasonable requirement in specifications to call for such a limitation. Experiments made by Candlot and verified in the Mechanical Laboratory of Sibley College indicate that an addition of 2 to 4 per cent of slaked lime or hydrate of lime added to a cement containing a small per¬ centage of gypsum, which has through the influence of time, lost its effect in retarding the cement, will restore the slow setting properties.

The addition of hydrate of lime without the addi¬ tion of the sulphate of lime, seems to have little or no effect on the time of setting, as shown by experiments made by Kniskern and Gass. Influence of Chloride of Calcium in the Setting and Hardening of Portland Cement Mortars. The investigation of E. Candlot as recorded in Ins work on Ciments et Chaux Hydrauliques, shows that when Portland cement is gauged with a feeble solu¬ tion of chloride of calcium, it has the effect of greatly retarding the time of setting, but when the Portland cement is gauged with a concentrated solution of chloride of calcium, as for instance 100 to 400 grammes per litre, it acts in a contrary manner and tends to increase the rapidity of setting. Candlot gives the following table as showing the results of his experi¬ ments : Solution of CaCla Time of Setting of Neat Cement.

The feeble solutions have no appreciable influence on cements which do not contain alumina. In case the concentrated solution of chloride of calcium is used for gauging, the aluminate of lime is attacked very energetically, which thus causes a very rapid set, as indicated by the experiments given above. Candlot also mentions that a feeble solution of chloride of calcium acts very rapidly in hydrating or slaking lime and quotes an experiment showing that a cement containing an excess of lime, gauged with pure water swelled and disintegrated because of the tardy expansion of the free lime, while the same cement gauged with a solution of chloride of calcium contain¬ ing 30 to 60 grammes per litre gave no evidence of swelling because the free lime was slaked completely and perfectly before the beginning of the initial set. The following experiment from Candlot shows the ac¬ tion of chloride of calcium in accelerating the slaking of lime. This action is shown in the experiment by the rapid rise of temperature caused by the slaking ac¬ tion when the lime is mixed with the solution of chloride of calcium : Time Temperature, Degree C. Distilled 30 grms. 60 grms. water CaCL per CaCL litre per litre Initial 18 18 18 5 min. 19 19 19 iO min. 20 21 • 24 15 min. 25 35 90 20 min. 25 90 98 25 min. 25 98 99 30 min. 20 90 95 The lime was completely slaked or hydrated in 30 minutes when gauged with either solution of chloride of calcium, but required about 48 hours before it was completely slaked when the distilled water was used. Candlot has also pointed out that a concentrated solution of chloride of calcium tends to harden Port¬ land cement very rapidly and causes the tensile strength to reach a maximum quickly. The cement made in that way at the end of the year being, how¬ ever, perfectly good and sound. Messrs. Kniskern and Gass in the Sibley Laboratory ground different percentages of chloride of calcium with cement clinker and afterwards made pats using in each case simply enough water to give the material its normal consistency for this purpose. Their re¬ sults show that the chloride of calcium had great effect in retarding the time of setting and exerted the greatest effect when about one-half of one per cent (i > CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS, by weight of the chloride of calcium was employed. On account of the water required, i per cent of the cloride of calcium would correspond approximately to gauging with a solution of 30 grammes per litre in the previous experiments quoted.

Chloride of calcium is a deliquescent material which rapidly absorbs moisture and it is possible that if ground dry with the Portland cement clinker even to the amount of 1-2 per cent, it wotild cause the material to gather dampness and thus have a bad effect. The chloride of calcium solution can be added readily by adding it to the water used in gauging since it dis¬ solves with extreme rapidity. The experiments indi¬ cate that the set can be controlled by using less than 1-2 per cent, which would be something less than 2 pounds to the barrel of Portland cement. Investiga¬ tions are still necessary for determining whether the effect of chloride of calcium added to the cement before grinding is permanent in its effects and whether if ground with the cement clinker it would exert any detrimental effect, and such investigations will be con¬ ducted in the Sibley College Laboratory at the first opportunity. SOMETHING ABOUT SULPHUR. By Edmund Johnson, Yankton, S. D. One of the greatest bugbears to the cement chemist is sulphur. The writer has had some experience with this element which may perhaps be of interest to others having it to contend with. When first going into a cement laboratory he sup¬ posed it possible to compute from the raw materials the per cent of SO-, that would be found in the clinker. Practical results soon showed this idea to be wrong. In one mill the materials we handled were shale and limestone. They were mixed in proportions of about 320 pounds of shale to 1000 pounds of limestone. The amount of sulphur in the shale was equivalent to about 7 per cent. S03. It existed partly as iron pyrites and partly as calcium sulphate. It will be seen that if none of this were volatilized it would exceed 2 1-2 per cent, in the clinker. For a period of over four months a daily analysis of the clinker was made from samples taken every half hour from the kilns. The average of all the sulphur determinations from these analyses was 1.15 per cent. Only two days did it exceed 2 per cent ; the highest being 2.22 per cent, and the lowest 0.25 per cent. Frequent determina¬ tions of sulphur as sulphide gave results varying from 0.01 per cent, to 0.14 per cent with an average of 0.062 per cent. Since then laboratory experiments have been made with other materials the clay of which contained as high as 12 per cent SOi3. For these experiments a small rotary kiln was constructed 21-2 feet long and 3 inches internal diameter, and heated with a Hos- kin’s blowpipe. The time during which the material is subjected to the heat is regulated by the slant and speed of revolution so as to approach as nearly as possible the actual conditions in the large rotary. Different mixtures were made, the clay being one- fifth to one-fourth of the whole. When the clinker was limed to 65 per cent, analysis did not show a trace of sulphur. When limed to 63 per cent, the clinker showed 0.91 per cent. S03. A very low-burn¬ ing mixture (56.50 per cent. CaO) with raw materials ground extremely fine gave 1.36 per cent. S03. During these experiments the writer conceived the idea that silicic acid being a colloid and unionizable in water solution, might there be very weak in pro¬ portion to the sulphur acids ; yet under the semi- molten condition in the rotary kiln its acid properties might be strong enough to displace sulphur from its compounds. To test this theory 1,000 grams of gyp¬ sum were ground and mixed with 184 grams of clay and burned in the small rotary kiln. The gypsum analyzed as follows : SOo, 2.30 per cent. Rl263, 0.75 per csnt. CaO, 32.18 per cent. S03, 46.89 per cent. The clay also contained 11 per cent S03. During the burning of this mixture the fumes of sulphuric acid became so strong in the laboratory that it was necessary to throw open the doors and windows. The clinker resembled first-class Portland cement clinker and when ground the resulting pro¬ duct proved to be a true Portland cement giving the following analysis : 502, 22.20 per cent. A1203, 7.64 per cent. Fe263, 4,39 per cent. CaO, 64.38 per cent. 503, 1.83 per cent. Pats made of the cement took their initial set in 3 hours and 20 minutes, and final set in 10 hours. They hardened well and passed a 4 hour boiling test O. K. in- every particular. The result of this experiment seems to indicate that under ideal conditions the sulphur in a cement CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. 7 mixture may be completely expelled during the burn¬ ing. The writer’s experience in the actual manufacture of Portland cement on a commercial scale has been that the more nearly the ideal conditions are ap¬ proached, the less trouble there will be from sulphur, even though it be present in the raw materials in per¬ centages usually considered sufficient to warrant their condemnation. The writer would like to hear from others who have had similar or contrary experiences. CONTRIBUTION FROM THE COMMITTEE ON UNIFORMITY IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, i. The object of the present communication is to offer to American chemists a sketch of the reasons for the existence of the Committee on Uniformity in Tech¬ nical Analysis and a statement of the policy by which it expects to be guided in seeking to remedy the present very unsatisfactory condition of analytical chemistry in at least some lines of work. The causes to which the committee owes its exis¬ tence can best be made clear by a review of the work done by several committees in the lines of cement, copper slag and zinc ore analysis, with the co-opera¬ tion of a large number of chemists throughout the country. Review of Past Work. In 1901, Mr. Clifford Richardson presented before the New York Section of the Society of Chemical In¬ dustry an address in which he showed the lamentable lack of agreement among different chemists in analyz¬ ing Portland cement. The result of his recommenda¬ tions was the appointment of a committee of the Sec¬ tion to consider the subject of technical analysis, the first line of work taken up practically being that of the analysis of Portland cement and raw cement mix¬ tures, by a subcommittee consisting of Messrs. Rich¬ ardson, S. B. Newberry and H. A. Schaffer. The re¬ sults of their labors have been made public in the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, 21, 12, and this Journal, 25, 1180. Discussions of and criti¬ cisms upon these reports have appeared at one time and another notably in the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, 21, 830 and 1216, and this Journal. 26, 995 ; also Cement and Engineering News, 16, 37. Opinions differ as to the merits of the proposed analytical procedures but the general effect of the sub¬ committee’s work has been to greatly stimulate in¬ terest in the matter of cement analysis by the bad showing made, and to create a desire for greater uni¬ formity in results. Owing to the wide publicity given to these reports, they will not be here discussed, though the extreme results rendered by the co-operat¬ ing analysts will be reproduced farther on. Inspired by his own experiments, Mr. Thorn Smith, of Isabella, Tennessee, had undertaken, independently of Mr. Richardson’s committee and without knowledge of its operations to ascertain the actual state of analysis with respect to copper slags, by enlisting the cc-oper- ation of a large number of chemists in the analysis of a sample prepared and distributed by himself. The lesults of this work were later placed in the hands of Mr. Richardson’s general committee, and, as in the case of the cement analyses, a critical report was rendered at their request by Dr. Hillebrand, of the United States Geological Survey. This report has never been published, though copies were placed in the hands of the chemists who had furnished analyses. 1 he original analytical returns with comments by Mr. I horn Smith, based on Dr. Hillebrand’s report, ap¬ peared in the Engineering and Mining Journal, 75, 295, to which reference should be made for details. Certain data from this report will follow those relat¬ ing to cements farther on. Later, a sub-committee on zinc ore analysis was appointed, consisting of Mr. W. George Waring, of Webb City, Mo., and Mr. George C. Stone, of New Lork City. They distributed three samples of ore dif¬ fering widely in character, and received more or less complete returns from forty-two chemists, on the basis of which the sub-committee has prepared a valuable report, which will receive attention in its proper place. Meanwhile, for reasons which are not pertinent to this report, the central committee of the New York Section of the Society of Chemical Indusry was dis¬ solved, and the laudable aims which it sought to at¬ tain might have failed altogether of further pursuit had not the Council of the American Chemical Society directed the appointment of the present committee for the purpose of continuing the work begun by its predecessor in the other Society. The report on zinc ore analysis, above alluded to, is now in the hands of our committee, and Messrs. Waring and Stone will be continued as one of its sub-commitl^es for the pur¬ pose of accumulating further data of an important character upon which to report at a later date. In the first three of the following tables are pre¬ sented briefly, for convenient reference, the extreme results reported by the chemists who co-operated with the former sub-committee on cement analysis and with Mr. Thorn Smith. They are followed by a de¬ tailed table of results reported by the zinc ore sub¬ committee and an abstract of certain features of that report. Greater space is devoted to this than to the other reports for the reason that it has not appeared in print and it is desirable that those who are engaged in the work of analysis be put in possession of the re¬ sults of their fellows without further delay.

It may be said with regard to the results of Table II that is was intended they should be arrived at accord¬ ing to a method suggested by the sub-committee on cement analysis, but they are in no way to be taken as a fair test of that method, for the reason that its provisions were adhered to by so few of the analysts. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the wide variations be¬ tween extremes, a critical review of all the data showed that marked progress had been made in cer¬ tain directions.

The samples were sent to a number of other college men, all of whom either de- dined to analyze them or failed to report after re¬ peated requests to do so.” After a brief discussion of the figures for iron, the authors say : “It is certainly not to the credit of the analysts that such enormous differences should exist in as simple a determination as iron,” a conclusion which is fully in accord with those expressed by Dr. Hillebrand in his report on the cement and copper slag analyses. j Naturally, the greater part of the report is devoted to the zinc figures. The methods used for determin¬ ing zinc were numerous and are numbered in the table. 1. — Low's method (Proc. Colo. Sci. Soc., 4, 179; this Journal, 22 198). 2. — Hinman’s modification of 1, using hydrochloric acid as the solvent (School of Mines Quart., 14, 40; Furman’s “Assaying,” 4th ed., p. 207). 3. — Wintersteen’s method, unpublished, but practi¬ cally the same as Voigt’s (Ztschr. angew. Chem. 1889, p. 307), using citric acid for tar¬ taric acid. 4. — Idie Joplin method, which is practically the Fahlberg method (Ztschr. anal. Chem., 13. 379, and Waring in this Journal, 26, 20-22). CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. 5- — This is 4, modified so as to remove copper by lead, or lead, copper and cadmium by alum¬ inum or hydrogen sulphide (this journal, 26, 23-24). 6. — Methods in which the iron is removed by am¬ monia, barium carbonate or as basic acetate^ and the manganese by an oxidizing agent. The zinc usually titrated, but in some cases weighed. Copper in all cases removed (this Journal, 26, 23-24). 7- — Methods in which copper was separated, the iron, precipitated as in 6, and the zinc by hydrogen sulphide from an acetic solution and then either weighed or titrated (Mahon: Am. Chem. J.. 4, 53). 8. — Waring’s method (this Journal, 26, 26-27). Upon tabulating the results for each sample sepa¬ rately by methods, the authors were able to discuss the data intelligently and to draw certain conclusions, which will not be reproduced, but reserved for a later report, after additional data have been accumulated with respect to method No. 8. The most superficial examination of these tables, which those interested can construct for themselves from the data of Table' IV* will make it obvious that some of the methods in common use are not by any means of universal ap¬ plication. Comments. The showing of the Tables I to IV is ample demon¬ stration that analytical chemistry, as ordinarily prac¬ ticed, is anything but an exact branch of the chem¬ ical profession. Mr. Waring has furnished additional data from his own experience, to which nearly every chemist could add, showing the lack of agreement that is all too common, often leading to serious conse¬ quences, aside from the reflection cast upon the pro¬ fession at large. That this is a state of affairs not only of long standing, but long since discovered in certain lines of work is sufficiently attested by the addresses, first of Dr. C. B. DVdley on the subjects of discrepancy in analysis, and standard methods for the analysis of iron and steel,1 and second lv of Baron Hans Juptner von Jonstorff.2 Most of the causes underlying variations in results of different chemists have been very fully discussed by these gentlemen, and a perusal or re¬ perusal of their papers and the discussions following them will be time well spent by most analysts. To repeat the substance of them here would lead too far. Suffice it to say that sources of error were pointed out besides the familiar ones of lack of uniformity in samples, poor quality of reagents, etc., or defects in the method or the chemist himself, such as the employ¬ ment of different atomic weights. This last, while not a prolific source of error, may, as pointed out by Baron Juptner, give rise at times to serious mistakes. That due to poor reagents will, in time, it is hoped, be lessened as a result of the work now being done by a Committee of this Society, in co-operation with the National Bureau of Standards. With samples of the kind represented by the an¬ alyses of Tables I to III, marked errors due to me¬ chanical sorting of once homogeneous materials must, from the very nature of those materials, be out of the question. Even with the zinc ores of Table IV the errors are of such a character as to render non-homo¬ geneity, as well as most of the other ordinarily enum- !) crated causes of error, quite inadequate as an explan¬ ation. There is a growing and seemingly well- grounded opinion, which has been given expression by Mr. Thorn Smith and the authors of the zinc report that our methods of teaching are largely ac¬ countable for the unsatisfactory state of affairs. There is abundant evidence in the mass of data accumulated by the several sub-committees referred to in support of this view, after making full allowance for the fact that with the best instruction not all students will make good chemists. # Policy of the Committee. In view of the facts set forth, this committee ha? adopted the following policy for the guidance of its work, a policy which is subject to change or expan¬ sion, as the need arises. (1) To use every endeavor to impress upon chem¬ ists the necessity for such changes, either in methods of analysis or of manipulation, together with a con¬ trol of the purity of reagents in use, as will make it possible to arrive at greater uniformity in the results of analyses made by different analysts. (2) To determine whether the lack of uniformity is to be attributed to lack of proper instruction in our schools or to mere carelessness in manipulation, by inviting the co-operation of the instructors in an¬ alytical chemistry in the work, distributing among them standard material for analysis, the results of the analysis of which shall demonstrate the accuracy of the method taught by them. (3) To test, in conjunction with the National Bureau of Standards, various methods, and determine their accuracy and suitability for general use. It may be said in this connection that the hearty co-operation of the Bureau of Standards has been promised, contingent only on the appropriation by Congress of the funds needed to secure the help of competent chemists. Application for such an appro¬ priation will be made at the coming session of Congress, and it is the desire of the Committee that friends of this movement use what influence they may possess to forward it. This may be done in part, by presenting in writing to the Director of the Bureau arguments in favor of co-operation, especially when strengthened by a clear statement of specific problems whose settlement may have commercial im¬ portance. (4) To prepare samples of materials of different character whose exact composition shall have been determined by the most careful analyses of experts. (5) To place such samples in the care of the Na¬ tional Bureau of Standards for preservation and dis¬ tribution to persons desiring to test their methods of analysis or manipulation, or to check the work of students or technical chemists employed in works. (6) To invite the co-operation of persons interested in the analysis of any particular class of material, by the organization of sub-committees for the prep¬ aration and distribution of samples, the chairman of which shall be, for the time being, a member of the general committee and entitled to vote on the subject which his sub-committee has under consideration. It will not be the policy of this Committee to com¬ mit the Society as a body to the endorsement of any methods as standard, but merely to recommend such as may be found satisfactory. Nor will the Com¬ mittee intrude on fields of work that may be already 10 CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS , well covered by existing organizations, such as the Society of Official Agricultural Chemists. Suggestions as to modifications of the policy of the Committee, or criticisms of it, will be thankfully re¬ ceived. W. F. HILLEBRAND, Chairman. CHAS. B. DUDILEY, H. N. STOICfES, CLIFFORD RICHARDSON, Secretary. ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PORTLAND CEMENT MANUFACTURERS. The annual meeting of this Association was held at the Hotel Astor, New York City, on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 13th and 14th, 1904. The As¬ sociation has a membership of fifty companies or mills, representing a capital of not less than $50,000/ 000. The output of these mills is over 90 per cent of the total production of Portland cement in the United States. Forty-five out of the fifty mills included in the membership were represented. The meeting was one of the most interesting and enthusiastic ever held by the Association. The first day’s session was devoted to business of the Associa¬ tion ; reports were received from the various Com¬ mittees detailing the work of the Association for the past year. Treasurer’s report was submitted, show¬ ing a prosperous financial condition. The most interesting reports were from the Com-, mittees on “Uniform Specifications,” “Steel Concrete” and “New Uses.” The Committee on Uniform Speci¬ fications have been co-operating with the Commitees of the American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society for Testing Materials, American Railway En¬ gineers and Maintenance of Way Association and the Institute of Architects. The result of the reports of these Committees is a report embodying a set of uniform specifications and methods of testing, which have been approved by the Associations interested in the subject. The importance of the standard specifications is recognized by all, including the manufacturer, en¬ gineer and contractors or consumer, and the adoption of the report in question is cause for congratulation. The Committees on Concrete-Steel reported co¬ operation with committees representing the Iron and Steel Industries, American Society for Testing Mate¬ rials, and American Society of Civil Engineers. These Committees are engaged in an effort to formulate standard methods of construction. It is a recognized fact that the cement industry is; open to a certain measure of injury by the possible failure of reinforced concrete-steel constructions, due to improper plans and careless methods. It is to avoid this danger that these several committees are co-oper¬ ating. The constitution and by-laws of the Association were so revised as to materially increase the income of the Association. With this increased fund, it is the intention of the Executive Committee to extend and enlarge the usefulness of the Association and en¬ courage chemical research. During the year, the practice of having papers on subjects of interest to the industry read and discussed has proved interesting and instructive. The second day’s session was devoted entirely to the reading and discussion of the following papers : “Cement Testing,” by W. Purves Taylor. “Irregular Method of Testing Cement,” by H. A. Schafer. “Some Further Investigations in Regard to the Constitution of Portland Cement,” by Clifford Rich¬ ardson. “Reinforced Concrete,” by Chas. S. Hill. “Cyclone .System of Burning Powdered Coal,” by E. H. Stroud. “Laboratory Work at St. Louis,” by Richard L. Humphrey. The annual dinner was served Tuesday evening, December 13th, at the Hotel Astor. Members and guests gathered about the board to the number of ninety-five. Speeches were made by Clifford Richard¬ son, John M. Goodell and W. Purves Taylor. THE GERMAN CEMENT INDUSTRY. At the close of the year 1904 the status of the German cement industry was unsatisfactory. The sales and out¬ put both declined notwithstanding the formation of the various individual mills into groups or syndicates which operated within prescribed territorial limits free from the competition of other mills outside of such territory, except in one or more sections where cement may be shipped or sold in the territory of another group or syndicate under certain restrictions and limita¬ tions and control of the syndicate in¬ to whose territory the cement is to be delivered. The combinations or syndicates are organized on the following lines : 1st. The Rhenish-Westphalia Cement Syndicate with 25 plants, headquarters at Bochum. 2nd. The South Gorman Comenh Syndicate, 26 plants, with headquarters at Heidelberg. These two syndicates have an agree¬ ment to co-operate up to the year 1913. The following cement mills are bound to co-operate under tbelihenish- Westphalian Syndicate. The figures! following the names of each individual mill is the allotment in barrels of ce¬ ment, such mill is permitted to contrib¬ ute to the syndicate each year under the articles of combination : No. 1.

No. 25. Portland Cement and Lime Works, Anna, 230,000 bbis. Outside of the syndicate is the Mar¬ ies & Bender Portland Cement Works, which sells under the syndicate. The Stockmeyer Portland Cement Works is not in any way affiliated wiih the syn¬ dicate. This plant produces from 560,- 000 to 825,000 barrels per year. This does not seriously interfere with the operation of the syndicate. The Elsa, given as No. 6, in the above list, is bound to the syndicate up to the year 1906. The works which heretofore have been delivering cement into the South German syndicate territory from the R. -Westphalian syndicate territory no longer do so under a mutual agree¬ ment, while a group of 14 mills, af¬ filiated with the South German syndi¬ cate, are still permitted to market from 275,000 to 330,000 barrels m the Rhen¬ ish- Westphalia syndicate territory ,, through the South German syndicate sales offices at Dusseldorf, under the supervision of the Rhenish-Westphalian syndicate general sales offices at Bo¬ chum. The 14 plants above mentioned are as follows : 1. Wetzler Portland Cement Works. 2. Budersoche Iron Co. 3. Portland Cement Works, Micke. 4. Portland Cement, Heidelberg- Mannheimer. 5. Karlstadt Portland Cement Works. 6. Wurtemberger Portland Cement Works. 7. Lothinger Portland Cement Works. 8. Wetteran Portland Cement Works. 9. Ingelheim Portland Cement Works. 10. Fr. Seiger & Co., Portland Ce¬ ment Works. 11. Offenbacher Portland Cement Works. 12. C. H. Booking & Co., Portland Cement Works, Malstadt-Burback. 13. Rombach Portland Cement Works. 14. Diedesheim-Neckarelz Portland Cement Works. The combined capacity is 7,150,000 barrels per annum. Of this amount only 65 per cent, of the capacity has been sold in 1904. These sales include shipments to Holland, Belgium and trans-Atl antic ports. The Rhenish-Westphalian syndicate will regulate and control all export sales from its Bochum sales offices, from January 1st, 1905, for cement produced within its own territory. A joint sales office has been established at Rotterdam, Holland, for the two German syndicates, and a Belgian syndicate. These three groups will act together on prices and quantities for Holland consumption. Heretofore the sharp competition waged in the Hol¬ land markets between the present con¬ tracting parties resulting in cutting of prices wherever opportunity offered. The combine will now obtain fair prices in Holland. The South German Cement Syndi¬ cate, with sales offices located at Heid¬ elberg, controls the following works, the quantity in barrels which each plant is permitted to contribute being given in figures after the name of each plant : No. 1.

Of the above named works, Nos. 11 and 24 have been purchased by the Heideberg-Mannlieim corporation, while Nos. 19, 25 and 26 have been closed under a yearly bonus paid by the South German Syndicate.. The combined capacity of the plants controlled by the South German Syn¬ dicate is about 1,110,000 tons, or 5,550,000 barrels, of which 70 per cent Avas marketed. In this territory all works are controlled by the syndicate with one exception. Agreements have likewise been made with the French & Swiss Cement works to regulate cement shipment over the respective boundaries of those countries. This agreement continues to 1913 when the life of the present syndicates expires. Dykerhoff & Son alone are outside of the syndicate, as this firm makes higher prices than the syndicate. It does not interfere with the operation of the syn¬ dicate. In the Province of Hanover all plants have united, except the Te- tonia, of Misburg, which has agreed to maintain syndicate prices for 1905. The Lower Elbe Works, have a com¬ bination which does not affiliate with the Hanover group. Competition ex¬ ists between them. The Rhenish-Westphalian, the South German and Middle German groups have a working agreement. The Silesian group operate under an old agreement regulating sales and prices. The Stettin group have refused to en¬ ter any combination. Seven different groups of cement plants notv exist in Germany, as follows : 1st, the Rhenish-Westphalian; 2nd, the South German; 3rd, the Hanover; 4th, the Middle German; 5th, the Lower Elbe ; 6th, the Silesian ; and 7th, the Stettin-Berlin group. Unsur- mountable difficulties have been en¬ countered in attempting to unite the seven different groups into one syndi¬ cate. The Rhenish-Westphalian Syndicate has raised prices. $71.40 is now the schedule on 11 tons of cement, being an increase of $14.68 over former quotations. CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. The syndicate allows 4 3-4 cents for empty sacks with free return. Central points are being established to. facili¬ tate the handling, cleaning and mend¬ ing of sacks. Rebates are to be given on sales of cement in accordance with the quan- t i tv purchased during the year, the greater quantities purchased the larger will be the rebate, which will be dis¬ tributed at the close of each year. The syndicate requires each purchas¬ er to sign an agreement which pre¬ vents such customer from using and disposing of the cement outside of the territory designated in the bill of sale and subject to the following restric¬ tions and penalties : 1st. The purchased is not to pur¬ chase cement outside of the syndicate territory in which it is to be used. 2nd. Xo purchaser can order in quantities of 55 tons without first hav¬ ing the consent of the syndicate in whose territory it is to be used. 3rd. The purchaser cannot buy or sell or offer for sale cement to persons selling brands of cement not made by the syndicate, or to persons using other brands. 4th. Cement cannot be reshipped from the station designated in the con¬ tract, to another station, not named in the bill of sale. The purchaser must in every case designate where the ce¬ ment is to be used, in case of reship¬ ment by the purchaser, the syndicate is empowered under its contract of sale to impose a penalty of $11.90 on each 11 tons of cement delivered for violat¬ ing the clause, As these restrictions cover only the year 1905 their success¬ ful operation cannot be determined un¬ til 1906. The state of the German cement in¬ dustry at the close of the year 1903 was not flattering. Only 22 plants out of a total of 68 declared a dividend; 46 plants did not declare any dividends, while 16 plants suffered considerable loss. Under these conditions, some¬ thing had to be done to prop up a once flourishing industry, hence the forego¬ ing restrictive regulations as to sales and distribution of cement were estab¬ lished. Last season prices were rather satis- factorv due to the revival of the build¬ ing industry, while the contemplated new Rhenish-Hanover canal, gives pro¬ mise of better prices for the Xorth German cement industry. The export trade has shown a steady decline from these works during the past three years. Exports from Germany: 1901, 2,533,260 barrels; 1902, 3,207,197 bar¬ rel*: 1903, 3.432.997 barrels. Imports: 1901, 434,314 barrels; 1902. 259,736 barrels; 1903. 249,119 barrels. Excess of exports over imports: 1901. 2,098.946 barrels; 1902. 2.942,- 461 barrels; 1903, 3,183,733; which shows that the imports have steadily declined, while the exports have in¬ creased. The exports for the first 10 months of 1904 were 2,404,678 barrels, against 266,280 barrels imported for the same period, which indicates a decline in exports of 625,000 barrels due to the decline of exports to the United States, which was only 418,631 barrels for the first 10 months of 1904, against 1,011,891 for the same period in 1903. It would seem that the Rheinish- West¬ phalian Cement Syndicate has made prices too high under the present con¬ ditions of the market as it will tend to promote the erection of new cement plants which will make inroads upon the monopoly. Such high prices will likewise restrict consumption. The syndicate having increased its price on all cement sold at Cologne sales of¬ fice, $3.60 over the price asked at Bochum or Dortmund, over and above the freight charges, as there points could be reached by water at much lower rates from the south Ger¬ man Syndicate works. Yet the $3.60 freight rate applies to all such ship¬ ments in the vacinity of Bochum, while the Cologne sales office exacts $4.08 more per hundred barrel- on cement used at Portz where it is made by the Rheinish Portland Cement Works than at Bochum. The syndicate should make a uniform rate at the various mill's to give the consumer the bene¬ fit of the lowest rail or water rates ob¬ tainable. This would give Cologne and Pusseldorf consumers the same ad¬ vantage as in the Westphalian territory at Bochum. PRACTICAL WORK CONSTRUCT¬ ING SIDEWALKS. Read Before the Cement Users’ Con¬ vention, Indianapolis, Ind. « The specifications uniformly given by myself for cement sidewalk-paving are: First, excavate to a uniform depth of eleven inches below the finish grade; Second, fill with stone-coal cin¬ ders (not ashes) seven inches when well rammed to place; when the concrete is ready dampen the cinders to prevent absorption of water from the concrete; Third, on the top of the rammed cin¬ ders fill three inches deep with cement concrete prepared as hereinafter de¬ scribed, when thoroughly rammed to place; Fourth, then finish with one inch of fine cement mortar as herein¬ after described . The fine cement, mor¬ tar is made (all parts by bulk) of one part of Portland cement to two parts of clean sharp sand, mixed dry in a water¬ tight box. The concrete is made of five parts of durable stone crushed to a three-quarter inch mesh and thorough¬ ly screened to one part of the aforesaid fine cement mortar. In mixing the concrete first place the stone on a large water-tight platform, then wet thor¬ oughly, then apply the tine cement mortar (dry as yet) and mix until ev¬ ery particle of the stone is coated with the tine cement mortar, and apply to the work at once, thoroughly ramming to place. While the concrete is being rammed to place sufficient of the fine cement mortar should be wet enough to move freely under the trowel, im¬ mediately applied to the work, thor¬ oughly troweled down against the con¬ crete, “rodded-off” with a straight-edge held so as to compress the mortar, and rough-finished with a plasterer’s trowel. The work will then be left for the finisher who will first ‘“float” the work to a uniform surface and then give it a good polish with the trowel. Grav¬ el with no pebble larger than three- quarters of an inch may be substituted for the crushed stone before named, and where the gravel has sufficient sand of good quality mixed with it, naturally, the concrete may be made by mixing the Portland cement, one part to eight, directly with such fine gravel, first dry and then wet only enough to pack solidly and then immediately ap¬ plied to the work. Very simple in the telling and quite true, but it doesn’t necessarily sgcure good work, hence we need to consider some of the requisites that can not be entered-up in the written specifications. The first is a council that will stand bv the engineer in his* effort to secure good work. The people pay for good work and the council should see that they get it. The next requisite is a citv engineer with a back-bone, one sufficiently stiff enough to discharge an unfaithful workmrfp “insta.nter,” and to compel the contractor to realize the very important fact (to him) that poor cement work is dear at any price. The selection of the materials should be left entirely to the engineer. As to the Portland cement one can only say that, it is usually sound. I have found no such difference as is claimed by the various makers and by many cement users. Different “brands” work differently, but good results can be had from any. I have found it best to give the workmen that brand with which they best like to work. As to stone or gravel, I can say only that it must be durable. Many kinds of stone “airslake” and dissolve out of the work. To say “clean sharp sand” is sufficient, but some may not know just what is meant by “sharp.” It means a sand that shows acute angles under the microscope and so hard that when rubbed between the thumb and fingers none crumbles and no dust forms. It should give a good, sharp, clean ring dhen handled with a shovel. But let me give you my test. Mix your ce¬ ment and sand in such proportions as CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. to bring out a plainly discernable “slate-green” color. If you can not develop that color, get sand with which it can be done. With that you are as¬ sured of good work, without it you are not. It is the opinion of your writer that more defective work is due to a poor quality of sand than to all other causes combined. Too much in¬ sistence can not be made that all the materials must be clean. The entire virtue of cement is in its adhesiveness If the materials are not clean the ad¬ hesion will not take place. This par¬ ticular applies to the water as well as to the other materials. Some critic may here say that he lias had good work from sand which showed considerable color on the hand and that made the water yellow when thrown into it. Quite true, and quite untrue. The result is apparently, in many instances, better work. But it is only in appearance. The clay which makes this color is not calcined and sooner or later dissolves out of the work with corresponding loss of -Strength. Many years ago masons and plasterers learned that with a clean sharp sand and well burned limie as good results were not had with clean water as wTith water to which some yellow clay was added and well stirred in before mixing with the lime and sand. The substructure of the sidewalk may be of the natural surface, crushed stone, gravel or cinders. The essential point is to secure drainage. If that can , not be had in any other way drain tile must be used. Your writer prefers cinders because they part with the water more readily than do other ma¬ terials and with them there is no ten¬ dency to the formation of “frost-nails” which is the prime cause of cracking of the work. Just here I want to en¬ ter a protest against the use of deep- tongued tools in finishing between the blocks. The usual specifications for dividing the work into blocks are: Di¬ vide the concrete into blocks of not more than 25 square feet area with a sand joint not more than 1-2 inch wide. Also divide the finish coat into like blocks with the joints exactly over the sand joints in the concrete with a trowel-cut' only and finish with a mark¬ ing-tool having a tongue not more than 1-4 inch deep nor more than 1-16 inch thick and joined to the plate with a radius of not more than 1-8 inch. Yet T frequently find men using a marker having a tongue an inch deep and a quarter of an inch thick. The theory for this is that the deep cutting pre¬ vents cracking beyond the “cut.” Tt doesn’t ; hence the theory is incorrect. The “trowel-cut” makes a permanent division in the top coat. The shallow marker presses the edges elom together, hut they do no! unite, and so prevents the entrance of water into the joint; hence there is no expansion to push the blocks apart. Great care should he had that none of the dry sand used in making the “sand-joint” in the con¬ crete is permitted to fall upon the top of the concrete. If it does it will pre¬ vent the “cap,” of fine cement mortar, from uniting with the concrete and the “cap” will he loose and he liable to crack off to that extent. Among the workmen are some requi¬ sites that' can not be written in the specifications. . Oftener than otherwise among the common laborers will he found a better “stripper” than among expert carpenters. It is just a “knack” in setting the side-rails for pavements and hacks, fronts and divisions for curbs and gutters, that some men have and others do not. Again every mason and plasterer knows that there is much in the “tempering” of the mortar, and a good mason or plasterer demands the services of some one whom he consid¬ ers to be an expert at that work. It is all in the “look” and the “feel,” and some men have the “knack” for it and others do not. Usually it is best to em¬ ploy an expert “finisher,” hut, often, among the day laborers will he found a man who will readily get the “knack” of knowing just when to apply the float and just how to apply the trowel to get a fine finish upon the work. To Councilmen, I would say, “cut out” your superintendents. Usually political favorites, rarely with any prac¬ tical knowledge, and wholly without any legal power, they are more a hin¬ drance than a benefit to the work. Make your engineer responsible for good work. If he needs supervision as¬ sistants, let him select them and mlake him responsible for their acts. In regard to proper “tamping” and “ramming,” both the tensile and the compressive strength of the work are largely \"dependent, upon this one thing and everybody can not do it. The rammer is usually an iron plate with an upright handle. It this falls hut a very little diagonally it stirs up the work instead of compacting it. Among any ten common laborers will he found at least one who will he found with the knack of dropping the “rammer” sauare upon the work. He who can do this will have no “jar” from the handle to hi- arms and the dread of the tool, which most laborers have, will entirely disappear. Such a man will do twice the work of others and do it well where the others do not. and do it satisfac¬ torily to himself. Tn crushed and screened “Blue hole” oolitic Indiana limestone, granite, marble and other fine building stones, you have the ma¬ terials, whmh. combined with Portland cement and suitable sand, will produce better and finer effects in both internal and external architecture, than are produced by the natural stones, and at a much less cost. These artificial stones will receive as line a polish as the nat¬ ural stones, if you will but study how it is done. About Repairs. Where cement work is broken, re¬ move the broken part and cut away to a clean surface. Then dampen this clean surface and cover very lightly with dry cement and immediately ap¬ ply the new material which is to take the place of the part removed, and fin¬ ish as at first. If a part of the work becomes worn and presents a coarse, rough surface, it is because the finish coat was not properly “tempered” in the making of the work. The best rem¬ edy is to take equal parts of unslaked lime and Portland cement, and, within a spell of fine weather, sprinkle lightly all over the worn places, and leave it to he kicked about by the feet of passers-by until after a rain. Much surer effects will he attained by making several applications than by applying all at once. Albert T. Gridley, C. E., Aurora, Ind. REINFORCED CONCRETE. Read at the Northwest Conerete Products Convention, Minneapolis.., By C. A. Turner, M. Am. Soc. C. E., 810 Phoenix Bldg., Minneapolis. M i n ni. Gentlemen : In greeting you this evening I de¬ sire to express my hearty sympathy with the object of our Convention, to disseminate popular information re¬ garding the use of Portland cement. The industry and enterprise of the American Portland cement manufac¬ turer has now placed at the disposal of the enterprising engineer or builder, a thoroughly reliable material when properly handled which bids fair to replace timber and structural steel in buildings and short span bridges. In making this statement the writer will say frankly that the view expressed is the result of eighteen years practical experience in building and structural work, as draughtsman, contractor and designing engineer. For the past ten years the writer has followed closely each and every structure in concrete steel that came to his attention, hut it has been only of late that he has been in position to place the result of his study in the form of reinforced concrete structi-fres, which will he illustrated later.* In treating the subject from the pop¬ ular standpoint, the writer would first sav a few words as to the reliability of the construction as compared with steel or timber. Ignorant abuse will render dangerous the best material which the engineer uses. — for example, *[This will appear in our next issue.] 14 CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS. — some months ago the writer was call¬ ed on to inspect some coupler pockets forged out of 1 1-4 x 4 inch bats made by a Pittsburg company. They were worthless, the writer was told, and go¬ ing to the pile and selecting four, they were placed on the ground and struck a few sharp blows with a sledge, a sin¬ gle blow fractured 10 square inches of metal in two cases. In normal condi¬ tion this area would carry 600,000 lbs. in tension. Taking the shank to a steam hammer, the center was bent flat on itself without fracture proving that the smith had burned the steel in forging, until it was worthless at the bend. Similar inexcusable ignorance in working concrete will likewise result in inferior work, but by no means to such an extent as that instanced in the case of the steel. The mistake that is made by many in fabricating reinforced concrete is the endeavor to get strength with a cheap concrete. A common proportion is 1 cement, 3 sand, 5 stone — a mixture much too poor to secure the best re¬ sults, or the greatest strength for a medium cost. A mixture of 1 cement to 2 of sand and 2 broken stone of size from a pea to that which will pass a three-quarter inch screen is to be pre¬ ferred. The stone should be screen¬ ed, if limestone, otherwise the dust such as that of trap rock or granite may be used in lieu of sand. By mak¬ ing this mixture wet enough to flow slowly and require no tamping what¬ ever, the question of poor workman¬ ship while the material is mixed by machine in exact proportions is en¬ tirely eliminated ; any laborer you may employ who can dump the car and level off the cement will do as good work as can be done. Such concrete three months old should give a value in compression of 2,500 lbs. per inch, or more, without reinforcement. In the form of a col¬ umn, if constrained laterally, Consi- dere has shown that this crushing strength can be increased five fold, or more, dependent on the reinforce¬ ment. The principle of this reinforcement is this: If we take a light sheet metal cylinder and fill the same with sand, the cylinder will support a load on the sand much greater than it would empty, since the metal is in tension and the filling with the lateral restraint carries the load. Now were the metal shell square, evidently the sides of the shell would bulge sidewise under the internal pressure — similarly any attempt to hoop a reinforced column with a square hoop is an amusing absurdity, the slightest lateral bending removing the necessary restraint. At first thought it might seem that a continuous cylindrical shell would be the best means of reinforcement, but the vertical metal being more rigid than the concrete, would be strained to its limit before being brought into action in its capacity of lateral rein¬ forcement, hence the undesirability of attempting to make the vertical re¬ inforcement used continuous, 1. e., without some concrete between ends where this principle is to be employed, or making the reinforcement in form of a spiral coil as recommended by Considere. The criticism that may be urged against some of these forms of rein¬ forcement appears to the writer to lie in the failure to make a good connec¬ tion to the beams. For that reason the reinforcement advocated by him is in the form of a grill of vertical rods banded at intervals by strong riveted hoops with one of the rods bent out¬ ward into each beam, connected to and supported by the column, and the whole wrapped or hooped with netting. As in this country the use of con¬ crete construction is in its earlier stages, it is not surprising perhaps, that many of its advocates are imitating the meth¬ ods of framing required for construc¬ tion in entirely different materials, rath¬ er than forms and proportions peculiar¬ ly adapted to reinforced concrete. Mr. Humphrey in his excellent talk yes¬ terday emphasized in connection with bridges the effort to bury a structural steel frame of sufficient strength for the load in concrete and term the clumsy conglomeration, reinforced con¬ crete. In the structural line wye have at¬ tempts to reinforce structural steel with concrete, to put in beams as thick as required for the old fashioned wood framing, attempts to reinforce in one direction only, forgetting that in a monolithic mass of the size with which we are dealing, temperature stresses must be provided for in the reinforcement of the work so as to make it stand without cracking. In designing reinforcement of beams, advantage should be taken of the prin¬ ciple of continuity, since with the con¬ stant section we have to provide only for two-thrids the moment of a simple beam and we have but one-fifth of the deflection, for the beam fixed at both ends that we would have for a simple beam. This system of design calls for the major section of the metal for flange reinforemen t over the support and furnishes ample provision for shear. In construction work in this line it is well to bear in mind that centering is a considerable item and that each additional beam is an extra expense. While we may not discard beams for heavy work for light loads, such as two to four hundred pounds per square foot, we may make a simple slab from column to column spacing 16 to 18 ft. running main lines of reinforcement from column to column, directly and transversely with lighter fabric be¬ tween these lines, all buried in a slab of uniform thickness. A few words regarding the interest- in peculiarities of reinforced concrete. We will shortly illustrate a panel which under 82 tons load showed abso¬ lutely no deflection whatever. Now the materials with which we deal in engineering work are elastic, why then such deportment of these beam’s? In setting up, the concrete shrinks and the rods reinforcing the bottom of the beam are actually in compression, also the top of the beam in tension due to internal stress. Until this condition is counterbalanced we could then ex¬ pect no elastic deformation. This fea¬ ture of the deportment of reinforced concrete is worthy of serious consid¬ eration by those who contemplate using shapes of irregular form as reinforc¬ ing members. In crushing, concrete usually shears at an angle approximately forty-five degrees to the direction of pressure, hence plain reinforcement, either par¬ allel or at right angles to the line of pressure has a marked influence on its strength. To return to the more popular phases of the question of reinforced concrete : Can it be figured with accu¬ racy? And do we know enough about it to use it with safety? The answer is emphatically in the affirmative. The engineer can figure thc strength with the same degree of precismn certainly, that he can timber construction, while if the tensile value of the concrete is disregarded as is in good practice, the error is invariably on the side of safety. How does reinforced concrete com¬ pare in cost with older styles of con¬ struction? For heavy buildings we can compete with wood when the work¬ ing load is 500 lbs. per square foot or more. For lighter loads we can compete at a good profit with any of the older forms of fireproof construction, saving the owner the cost of the entire steel skeleton . For loads greater than 800 lbs. per square foot it is cheaper than timber if both are made of equal strength. As regards its fireproof properties there is nothing in use which equals it. At the Paris Exposition the Hen- nebique Company erected a cement concrete building in which to test both the strength of the floors and their resistance to fire when loaded. The first floor was loaded to three thousand pounds per square yard. The upper floor to two thousand pounds. The deflection was barely 1-25 of an CEMENT AND ENGINEERING NEWS . 15 inch. A big fire of cord wood and oil was started on lower floors and kept at full intensity for an hour, and al¬ though the heat developed was 1800 degrees F., yet the temperature on the floor above the fire only increased about four degrees, showing that mer¬ chandise would not have been injured in such a position. At the end of an hour the deflection of the heated ceil¬ ing had increased to one-fourth inch. Then the whole building was drenched with water, and two hours later the load was removed whereupon a rise of one-half inch took place showing no permanent deflection or injury to the construction. The construction of reinforced con¬ crete is supposed by many to be slow business while as a matter of fact in no svstem of construction can the mate- rials be as promptly obtained or the work more rapidly pushed. The ce¬ ment and rods can be obtained, if nec¬ essary, at a week's notice and the rough timber for forms is a stock proposition. A single half-yard mixer and suitable crew can readily erect a story with a floor of 16,000 square feet area in a week’s time with fair weather. To the contractor who has vainly tried in our cold climate in winter to conglomerate 16 parts of frozen sand and gravel with one part of cement — plus ice water, and produce smooth concrete work, the idea of putting in satisfactory reinforced concrete in win¬ ter seems an impossibility. He is re¬ spectfully referred to the paper of W. A. Rogers, read before the Western Society of Engineers, who concludes from the tests that exposing freshly mixed Portland cement to a freezing temperature seems to offset its rate of hardening making it slower, but event¬ ually the concrete will be just as good as if it had not been exposed to the cold. A conclusion in accord with the writer’s experience. As the object of this convention is the promotion of the cement industry, a few notes on experience in promotion of a few concrete constructions may be of interest. We call on our friend, the outspoken, honest old-fashioned architect and in¬ quire if we may be favored with an opportunity to figure on his elegant five story warehouse — well, he hadn’t con¬ sidered concrete — but what size would you make the columns? — He glances at you curiously, appar¬ ently to see whether you have a few loose gears sticking through the epi¬ dermis covering your thinking ma¬ chine, and wants to know, — whether you concrete men are plumb crazy. You next see an owner and after getting him interested and convinced of the merits of your construction and your ability to give a bond for the full amount of the contract he takes ad¬ vice of some contractor who with abso¬ lutely no experience in this line wisely advises him that the work could not possibly be executed at this season in cement in order to carry out the work himself in wood — and so it goes. RAILWAY TRACK ELEVATION IN CHICAGO. City ordinances now in force call for the elevation of 138 miles of road bed, of which about 91 miles have been com¬ pleted. The total number of miles of single track to be laid on the 138 miles of road bed will be 710 miles, and of this, 447.95 miles of single track have been completed. The entire track elevation calls for 537 masonry sub¬ ways under the right of way at street crossings, of which 362 have been com¬ pleted up to Dec. 31, 1904. The es¬ timated cost for the entire work is $44,240,250. The cost of the work done to date is $28,802,250. Ordinances passed in 1904 call for the elevation of 17.25 miles of road bed in addition to the above, upon which 50 miles of single track will be laid', pierced by 83 additional subways. The estimated cost of the new work under the ordinance passed in 1904 will ba $4,450,000, making the entire cost of the work when completed $48,690,250, all to be defrayed by the railway com¬ panies owning the right of way. INFLUENCE OF GROUND IRON ORE ON THE STRENGTH OF CE¬ MENT MORTAR. It has been customary to add a given portion of powdered iron ore in the finishing coat of cement work to be subjected to heavy wagon traffic in or¬ der to insure stronger work. Tests made in the laboratory of the Tonindustrie Zeitung and compared with a mixture of 1 cement to 3 of normal sand did not show as high re¬ sults in tensile or compressive strength as an admixture carrying iron ore. The iron ore gave the test-pieces greater density as well as greater strength. The laboratory tests on pieces 30 days in water gave the following re¬ sults : 1 Portland Cement, 3 Normal Sand, Kg. per Cubic Centimeter. 1 Portland Cement, 2.75 Normal Sand, 0.25 Iron Ore, ) Kg. per Cubic Centimeter. 1 Portland Cement, 2.75 Normal Sand. 0.25 Powdered Sand. 328 408 493 308 378 521 319 378 535 309 388 416 308 382 526 317 391 500 323 395 484 322 403 468 305 421 465 318 401 462 Av. 315.7 Av. 394.5 Av. 487.0 • « U The abra&ion or rubbing test on the th red\" different mixtures 30 days in wat¬ er gave the following results : 1. — 1 part Portland Cement, 3 parts norman sand; loss 18 grams. 2. — I part Portland cement, 2.75 parts normal sand, 0.25 parts ground iron ore; loss, 16 grams. 3. — 1 part Portland cement, 2.75 parts normal sand, 0.25 parts ground sand meal; loss, 13 grams. Which shows that the highest in compressure strength and resistance to abrasion is found in the addition of 0.25 of sand meal due to the filling up of the voids between the sand grains. REINFORCED CONCRETE LIGHT¬ HOUSE. The Russian government has erected in the Gulf of Riga, near the Port of Riga, Russia, a circular light-house 131 ft. high by 28 ft. diameter at the base, which contracts to 6 ft. 7 ins. at the top, above which rises the lantern. The service room just below the lantern overhangs the walls 3 ft. 10 ins. The shaft or tower was calculated to resist a wind pressure of 564 pounds per square foot. The foundations are carried 8 ft. 3 ins. below the ground. The steel reinforcing consists of ten¬ sion rings and upright bars to dis¬ tribute the pressure more evenly upon the tension rings. The concrete encas¬ ing the steel skeleton in the walls was mixed 600 pounds of Portland cement to each cubic yard of clear sharp sand and gravel, care being taken to imbed and surround the steel bars with a rich cement mortar to insure a perfect bond between the bars and concrete. The use of reinforced concrete re¬ sulted in a saving of fully 40 per cent over other masonry construction. The concrete in the structure weighed 342 tons, and the steel used for reinforc¬ ing weighed 111 tons, the total weight of the structure being 453 tons, while the structure constructed of stone ma¬ sonry with a less factor of safety would have required 1,343 tons of ma¬ terial, or a direct saving of 890 tons by the use of reinforced concrete, or about two thirds less than stone ma¬ sonry, and at a saving of fully 40 per cent as before stated over other forms of masonry construction. The Alma Cement Co., of Wellston, Ohio, have abandoned the use of rolls for the preliminary reduction of clink¬ er and have substituted for coarse grindings t"
