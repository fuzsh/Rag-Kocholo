        "text": "SAP stands for “Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing.”\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn:\n\nWhat SAP is\n\nThe history of SAP’s name\n\nWhat SAP does\n\nLots more\n\nSo if you want to understand the acronym SAP in business terms, this article is for you.\n\nLet’s begin!\n\nSuper Simple: SAP in a Nutshell\n\nSAP is a HUGE European business software manufacturer.\n\nThe company was founded by five former IBM employees in Germany in 1972.\n\nToday, SAP provides the world’s leading business software applications that manage the various processes within companies and across company boundaries.\n\nThe SAP definition is:\n\nSAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) SE (Societas Europaea) is a European worldwide operating software company that makes software for the management of business processes suitable for organizations of any size and industry.\n\nSAP’s flagship products are applications to manage processes for ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).\n\nERP can be divided into many subcategories such as SCM (Supply Chain Management), PLM (Product Line Mangement), and CRM (Customer Relationship Management).\n\nAmong all the ERP software categories, CRM is the largest in terms of market size and the fastest growing.\n\nLet’s take a look at ERP and CRM:\n\nSAP Makes ERP Software\n\nAn ERP application intertwines, manages, tracks, and analyzes what a company does in order to achieve its objective.\n\nSAP offers ERP applications that are highly customizable for large and medium-sized companies as well as less-customizable standard solutions for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAdditionally, SAP provides industry-specific ERP applications to support core business processes in a wide variety of industries.\n\nSAP provides out-of-the-box ERP modules for industries like:\n\nAerospace and Defense\n\nAutomotive\n\nBanking\n\nChemicals\n\nConsumer Products\n\nDefense and Security\n\nEngineering, Construction & Operations\n\nHealthcare\n\nHigh Tech\n\nHigher Education and Research\n\nIndustrial Machinery & Components\n\nInsurance\n\nLife Sciences\n\nMedia\n\nMill Products\n\nMining\n\nOil and Gas\n\nProfessional Services\n\nPublic Sector\n\nRetail\n\nSports and Entertainment\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTransportation & Logistics\n\nUtilities\n\nWholesale Distribution\n\nAll SAP industry solutions and SAP ERP modules are in this complete SAP ERP modules list.\n\nSAP’s flagship product is the SAP ERP Business Suite, an integrated suite of business applications that covers almost any business process, including controlling, asset management, and human resources.\n\nThe latest version of SAP’s ERP Business Suite is SAP S/4HANA (SAP Business Suite 4 High-Performance Analytical Appliance).\n\nThe ERP software market is expected to top 96.74 billion U.S. dollars worldwide by 2023:\n\nIn comparison, global entertainment has around $100 billion in revenue.\n\nSAP is #1 in the ERP software market worldwide.\n\nAs the name implies, SAP S/4HANA is built on top of SAP HANA (SAP High-Performance Analytic Appliance) database technology developed by SAP.\n\nHANA’s main feature is that data is no longer stored on the hard disk, but in memory, so it is available more quickly.\n\nSAP Makes CRM Software Too\n\nSAP has been investing heavily in the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market lately.\n\nSAP is #2 in CRM, behind Salesforce, but is eager to become #1.\n\nhrough acquisitions, SAP now offers CRM cloud applications for:\n\nCommerce (SAP Commerce Cloud)\n\nCustomer data protection (SAP Customer Data Cloud)\n\nCustomer service (SAP Service Cloud)\n\nMarketing (SAP Marketing Cloud)\n\nSales (SAP Sales Cloud)\n\nThe CRM software market is predicted to generate $40.26 billion worldwide by 2023:\n\nIn addition to its CRM cloud applications, SAP offers an on-premise CRM application with SAP S/4HANA for customer management.\n\nPlus, there are still running a lot of SAP CRM 7.0 versions. SAP CRM 7.0 is SAP’s predecessor to SAP S/4HANA for customer management. It runs on-premise.\n\nFurther on the evolution of SAP’s name:\n\nThe Odd Naming History of SAP\n\nWhen SAP was founded in Germany in 1972, SAP stood for “Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung.” That translates to “System Analysis and Program Development” in English.\n\nWhen SAP was founded, it took the form of a private partnership (GbR) under the German Civil Code.\n\nIn 1976, SAP founded a limited liability company (GmbH) in accordance with German laws as a sales and support subsidiary to SAP’s private partnership.\n\nThis limited liability company was called SAP as well, but in this case, SAP stood for “Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung” or in English, “Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing.”\n\nWhen SAP turned into a stock company (AG) in 1988, SAP continued to stand for “Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing.”\n\nAnd it stuck with the same name when it transformed from a stock company to the European SE (Societas Europea) in 2014, and that has continued to the present day.\n\nThus, SAP originally stood for “Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung” in German, or “System Analysis and Program Development” in English.\n\nNow, SAP stands for “Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung” in German or in English: “Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing.”\n\nThat Is What Sap Stands for in Business Terms\n\nWhat does SAP stand for in business terms? It depends.\n\nIf you just mean the acronym, SAP stands for “Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing”.”\n\nBut if you want to know what SAP actually is, then SAP stands for a HUGE corporation that makes business software.\n\nSAP is the third largest software and programming company in the world:\n\nAnd, if you want to know what SAP does, then SAP stands for a manufacturer of software to manage the various processes in a company.\n\nApplications used by companies to intertwine, manage, track, and analyze business activities to achieve their business goals and relate to their partners and customers.\n\nMore Acronyms in the SAP Universe\n\nNever want to search for SAP acronyms in the deepest depths of the internet again?\n\nHere is THE SAP acronyms list:"
