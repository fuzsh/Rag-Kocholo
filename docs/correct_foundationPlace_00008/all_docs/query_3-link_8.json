        "text": "Difficult years\n\nAt FUCHS, the outbreak of the 2nd World War loomed large. By January 1939, imports of the important Pennsylvanian engines and cylinder oils came to a standstill. Soon, other important upstream suppliers also failed. In addition to supply problems, there were also personnel shortages. Most male members of the FUCHS workforce were drafted. Since traffic and transportation companies, formerly the main consumers of FUCHS products, had to downsize their operations and make their fleet available to the armed forces, Rudolf Fuchs had to acquire new customers. New customers were found in the industrial sector. The task now was to develop industrial oils. This was not always easy, but FUCHS' flexibility paid off. If there was no suitable lubricant available, FUCHS developed a new product within no time.\n\nDevelopment in focus: Hiring the first chemist\n\nToday, technologically advanced, process oriented and holistic lubricant solutions are a central success factor for FUCHS. Our worldwide network of experts meets customer requirements on a global level by quickly and efficiently networking fields of special expertise. The foundation for this was laid back in 1946 when the first chemist was hired. Today, more than 500 engineers and scientists work on over 600 research projects in 22 laboratories worldwide in the area of research and development, ensuring that we can supply high-quality, technologically advanced lubricants – ranging from standard to highly customized solutions.\n\nEntrepreneurial vision: FUCHS launched on the stock exchange\n\nIn order to financially underpin the numerous expansions, Manfred Fuchs, his mother and his two sisters decided to float the company on the stock exchange in 1985. However, the family was to retain the decisive voting majority in the future. Preference shares were therefore initially issued. The shares were placed by public offer at a price of DM 100 for each DM 50 share. There was a high level of oversubscription. The shares were approved for trading and official listing on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart stock exchanges. Both trading and official listing commenced on January 30, 1985. In the following year, FUCHS also went public with ordinary shares. However, the majority of the voting shares always remained in the possession of the founding family even during the increases in capital stock of the subsequent years, in which the founding family always participated. With a stock exchange value of just over 5 billion euros, FUCHS PETROLUB is today one of the most valuable and successful stocks on the MDAX. The shareholders have enjoyed an increase in value of about 9,000 percent over the last 20 years.\n\nThe next generation: Stefan Fuchs takes the lead\n\nAfter heading the company for 41 years and leading it from a regional lubricants manufacturer into a global market and technology leader Dr. Manfred Fuchs left the Executive Board and was succeeded by his son. With Stefan Fuchs, the third generation of the family took over the leadership of the Group on 1st January 2004. When appointed, the 35 year-old business management graduate had previously worked for two years in the auditing sector and three years at FUCHS in North and South America, before he became a member of the Executive Board in 1999 responsible for the business in Europe. Manfred Fuchs eventually moved to the Supervisory Board, where he was to serve as Deputy Chairman until 2017.\n\nVisionary investments: FUCHS launches the largest investment program in the company's history\n\nIn order to continue to grow profitably and sustainably in the future, FUCHS launched the largest investment program in its history in 2016. Between 2016 and 2018, about €300 million were invested in plant expansions and the construction of new production facilities - globally. For example, new grease plants were built in the USA and South Africa. New production facilities were built in Australia and Sweden. An intelligent lubricants plant was opened in Wujiang, China. In addition, the Asian headquarters and research and development hub in Shanghai were significantly expanded and modernized. In subsequent years, an average of €100 million per year were continued to be invested in organic growth. Most recently in the construction of a new polyurea plant in Kaiserslautern and a new office building at the Mannheim site.\n\nStart of a new journey: FUCHS2025 initiative\n\nAutonomous driving, e-mobility, new digital business models and the need for sustainable business - to meet these challenges, FUCHS is launching the FUCHS2025 initiative in 2018, which will address the topics of culture, strategy and structure. The goal: to build strengths and align our organization globally in order to realize our vision of 'Being First Choice' - that is, being the first choice for our customers, business partners, investors, future employees.\n\nFUCHS on board the Mars Perseverance Rover\n\nFUCHS products are now also available in space after acquiring Nye Lubricants in 2020. Nye has worked with leading space organizations for more than 65 years to develop cutting-edge formulations. Most recently, in February 2021, the Mars Perseverance Rover landed on Mars and with it, a barrier film from Nye Lubricants.\n\nThe NyeBar® Barrier Film formulation plays a critical role in preventing oil from migrating to the rover’s mast camera and compromising the image."
