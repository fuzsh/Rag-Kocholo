        "text": "SAP Virtualization\n\nThe advanced features in products from SAP and VMware combine synergistically to create perhaps the most powerful business process automation system that it is possible to build with today's technology.\n\nOur customers who want to leverage the agility provided by SAP NetWeaver速 enhancement packages also need the flexibility and powerful management features of VMware technology to achieve the kind of seamless, efficient network of interrelated processes that has long been envisioned but nearly impossible to achieve.\n\nSolution Benefits\n\nWith VMware virtualization solutions, your SAP solutions-based development, test, training, and production environments can cost less and be more productive than within a purely physical infrastructure. From server consolidation and containment to business process and data center automation, the full range of virtualization benefits can be applied to all sizes of SAP deployments.\n\nYou can dynamically rebalance applications while increasing resource utilization across your test, development, Q&A, training and production environments. And VMware solutions increase the availability of SAP applications with technologies such as VMware速 vMotion, VMware速 High Availability, and VMware速 vCenter Site Recovery Manager.\n\nTop Ten Reasons To Run SAP Software Solutions on VMware Virtualization Technology\n\nUpgrade safely to the latest SAP solutions and simplify the transition to 64-bit environments\n\nIncrease availability of all environments at lower cost\n\nCreate cost-effective disaster recovery systems\n\nQuickly deploy new SAP solutions-based environments for development and test\n\nAlign SAP resources with business priorities\n\nDecrease SAP data center costs for space, energy, cooling, hardware, and labor\n\nIncrease SAP data center utilization, flexibility, availability, and agility\n\nIncrease software quality at lower cost for your own SAP application-based development\n\nIncrease uptime during planned maintenance\n\nRealize immediate ROI\n\nVMware and SAP: A Dynamic Relationship\n\nVMware has forged a strong, collaborative relationship with SAP AG to maximize the benefits for our joint customers. The ties between VMware and SAP are many and deep; a few of the ways the two companies work together include:\n\nVMware vSphere is the only virtualization platform supported by SAP across both Linux and Windows for all environments, including Windows production.\n\nVMware is one of a very limited number of SAP Global Technology Partners.\n\nVMware is a key member of the SAP Co-Innovation Lab in Palo Alto, California, where SAP uses VMware technology to provision environments for new projects with its eco-system partners.\n\nVMware is a charter member of the SAP Enterprise Virtualization Community, which unites leading virtualization vendors to develop new strategies for business-process driven virtualization.\n\nVMware is also a member of the SAP Green IT Community, and the SAP Linux Labs\n\nVMware is closely involved with SAP virtualization plans. Projects and alignment are driven jointly by the VMware SAP alliance team and the Chief Virtualization Strategist at SAP Labs in Palo Alto, CA.\n\nVMware has a Technical Account Manager on site in Walldorf who collaborates with SAP teams on alignment and integration projects.\n\nVMware has support staff on site in Walldorf linked into the SAP support framework.\n\nThe SAP Center of Excellence in Walldorf uses VMware software to host customers for SAP ramp up and knowledge transfer.\n\nThe Virtualization Competence Center (VCC) for SAP:"
