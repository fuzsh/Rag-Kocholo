        "text": "Next generation launches\n\nSAP R/2 launches and quickly achieves the same high levels of stability as its predecessor.\n\nDebut\n\nSAP makes its first appearance at the âSYSTEMSâ IT trade show in Munich, Germany.\n\nJoint development\n\nSAP works with customers to add a production planning and control module to its portfolio.\n\nMuch-needed office space\n\nSAP embarks on a third office extension project to accommodate its constant and growing stream of new recruits.\n\nKey metrics\n\nEmployees number 125 by midyear; revenues jump to DM41 million by the end of the year.\n\nTrendsetter\n\nGerman technology company Heraeus becomes the first customer to install SAP's new module for production planning and control (RM-PPS).\n\nFrom Switzerland to the world\n\nThe Swiss town of Biel becomes home to SAPâs first international subsidiary, SAP (Schweiz AG), and to SAP (International) AG, the hub from which SAP conducts its international business.\n\nHuman resources\n\nSAP hires 48 new employees, largely to meet its huge demand for development resources for the new modules RK (cost accounting), PPS (production planning and control), and RP (human resources).\n\nIn numbersÂ\n\nSAPâs 163 employees generate revenues approaching DM48 million.\n\nTools for the job\n\nSAP's data center is now equipped with four servers: three from IBM and one from Siemens. Employees developing and enhancing the companyâs software have access to a total of 64MB of main memory.\n\nInternational operations\n\nFive employees from Walldorf move to the new office in Switzerland and begin supporting the company's international business. By the end of 1985, more than 250 people work at SAP, and revenues hit DM61 million.\n\nFocus on quality\n\nA quality assurance committee is set up to bolster the stability of SAP software.\n\nIn the limelight\n\nSAP â and its software â exhibit at CeBIT, the worldâs largest computer trade show, for the first time.\n\nRevenue landmark\n\nSAP hits the DM100 million revenue mark sooner than expected, as the introduction of new financial reporting standards brings in around 100 new orders for its asset accounting software.\n\nUnder construction\n\nSAP breaks ground on its new training center in Walldorf. Meanwhile, construction continues at the companyâs main offices â now in the fifth phase of expansion.\n\nGrowing the customer base\n\nIBMâs latest generation of servers makes SAPâs software available to SME customers. SAP establishes SAP Consulting to support new customers.\n\nMore international business\n\nSAP makes its first forays into non-German-speaking markets, setting up subsidiaries in France, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Two new local offices open: one in Hamburg to support customers in northern Germany; and the second in Munich to serve those in the south of the country. By the end of the year, SAP has more than 500 employees and is generating DM152 million in revenue.\n\nTransformation, going public\n\nSAP becomes SAP AG, a publicly-traded company. In two increments, it increases its capital stock from DM5 million to DM60 million. In October 1988, it lists on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart exchanges, issuing 1.2 million bearer shares at DM750.\n\nÂ\n\nImage:Â SAP's first day at the German Stock Exchange: Hasso Plattner, co-Founder of SAPÂ\n\nYet more computing power\n\nSAPâs data center now houses servers from IBM, Siemens, DEC, and Hewlett-Packard, and provides 1,224MB of memory.\n\nEasier to use\n\nSAP launches a new, more user-friendly interface for SAP R/2, and new tools, such as the ABAP/4 programming environment.\n\nInternational business\n\nSAP (International) AG in Switzerland is now responsible for 12 international subsidiaries, including those in Asia (Singapore), Australia, and Canada. There are 1,400 employees operating in 15 countries and generating close to DM370 million in revenue."
