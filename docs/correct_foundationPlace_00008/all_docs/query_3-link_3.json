        "text": "City in Baden-Württemberg, Germany\n\nThis article is about the city in Germany. For other uses, see Mannheim (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Baden-Württemberg, Germany\n\nMannheim (German pronunciation: [ˈmanhaɪm] ⓘ; Palatine German: Mannem[4] or Monnem), officially the University City of Mannheim (German: Universitätsstadt Mannheim), is the second-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, after the state capital of Stuttgart, and Germany's 21st-largest city, with a 2021 population of 311,831 inhabitants.[5] The city is the cultural and economic centre of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, Germany's seventh-largest metropolitan region with nearly 2.4 million inhabitants and over 900,000 employees.[6]\n\nMannheim is located at the confluence of the Rhine (Upper Rhine) and the Neckar in the Kurpfalz (Electoral Palatinate) region of northwestern Baden-Württemberg. The city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, Germany's warmest region. Together with Hamburg, Mannheim is the only German city bordering two other federal states. It forms a continuous conurbation of around 480,000 inhabitants with Ludwigshafen am Rhein in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on the other side of the Rhine. Some northern suburbs of Mannheim belong to Hesse. Upstream along the Neckar lies Heidelberg, the fifth-largest city of Baden-Württemberg and the third-largest of the Rhine-Neckar Region.\n\nMannheim is unusual among German cities in that its city centre streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to the city's nickname Quadratestadt (Square City). Within a ring of avenues surrounding the city centre, there are squares, numbered from A1 to U6, instead of street names. At the southern base of that system is Mannheim Palace, one of the largest palace complexes in the world, and the second-largest in Baroque style after Versailles. It was the former home of the Prince-elector of the Electoral Palatinate, and now houses the University of Mannheim, which repeatedly receives top marks in business administration and is sometimes known as the \"Harvard of Germany\".[7][8][9] The Mannheim May Market is the largest regional consumer exhibition of Germany.[10] The civic symbol of Mannheim is the Romanesque Mannheim Water Tower, completed in 1886 and rising to 60 metres (200 feet) above the highest point of the art nouveau area Friedrichsplatz. Mannheim is well-known for its inventions, including the automobile,[11][12] the bicycle,[13][12] and the tractor,[12] which is why the city is often called the \"city of inventions\".[14][15][16] The city is the starting and finishing point of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route, which follows the tracks of the first long-distance automobile trip in history.\n\nA Großstadt (major city with more than 100,000 inhabitants) since 1896,[17] Mannheim is now an important industrial and commercial city, a university town, and a major transportation hub between Frankfurt and Stuttgart, including an ICE interchange (the Mannheim Hauptbahnhof), Germany's second-largest marshalling yard[18] (the Mannheim Rangierbahnhof), and Germany's largest inland port[19] (the Mannheim Harbour). The city is home to many factories, offices and headquarters of several major corporations such as Roche, ABB, IBM, Siemens, Unilever and more. Mannheim's SAP Arena is home to German ice hockey record champions Adler Mannheim as well as the popular handball team Rhein-Neckar Löwen. Since 2014, Mannheim has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and holds the title of \"UNESCO City of Music\".[20] In 2020, Mannheim was classified as a global city with 'Sufficiency' status by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).[21] Mannheim is a smart city;[22] the city's electrical grid is installed with a power-line communication network.[23] The city's tourism slogan is \"Leben im Quadrat\" (\"Life in the[a] Square\").[24]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Mannheim.\n\nA brick kiln excavated in 1929 in the Seckenheim district, which operated from 74 AD to the early second century, attests to settlement in Roman times.[25]\n\nThe name of the city was first recorded as Mannenheim in a legal transaction in 766, surviving in a twelfth-century copy in the Codex Laureshamensis from Lorsch Abbey.[26] The name is interpreted as \"the home of Manno\", a short form of a Germanic name such as Hartmann or Hermann.[27] Mannheim remained a mere village throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1606, Frederick IV, Elector Palatine started building the fortress of Friedrichsburg and the adjacent city centre with its grid of streets and avenues. On 24 January 1607, Frederick IV gave Mannheim the status of a \"city\",[28] whether it really was one by then or not.\n\nMannheim was mostly levelled during the Thirty Years War around 1622 by the forces of Johan Tilly. After being rebuilt, it was again severely damaged by the French Army in 1689 during the Nine Years' War.\n\nAfter the rebuilding of Mannheim that began in 1698, the capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate was moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720[29] when Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine began construction of Mannheim Palace and the Jesuit Church; they were completed in 1760.\n\nIn 1819, Norwich Duff wrote of Mannheim:\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, Mannheim was the home of the \"Mannheim School\" of classical music composers. Mannheim was said to have one of the best court orchestras in Europe under the leadership of the conductor Carlo Grua. The royal court of the Palatinate left Mannheim in 1778, as Charles Theodore had become Elector of Bavaria and moved to Munich. Two decades later, in 1802, Mannheim was removed from the Palatinate and given to the Grand Duchy of Baden.\n\nIn 1819, August von Kotzebue was assassinated in Mannheim.\n\nThe climate crisis of 1816–17 caused famine and the death of many horses in Mannheim. That year Karl Drais invented the first bicycle.\n\nInfrastructure improvements included the establishment of Rhine Harbour in 1828 and the construction of the first Baden railway, which opened from Mannheim to Heidelberg in 1840. Influenced by the economic rise of the middle class, another golden age of Mannheim gradually began. In the March Revolution of 1848, the city was a centre for political and revolutionary activity.\n\nIn 1865, Friedrich Engelhorn founded the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (Baden Aniline and Soda Factory, BASF) in Mannheim, but the factory was constructed across the Rhine in Ludwigshafen because Mannheim residents feared air pollution from its operations. From this dye factory, BASF has developed into the largest chemical company in the world. After opening a workshop in Mannheim in 1871 and patenting engines from 1878, Karl Benz patented the first motor car in 1886. He was born in Mühlburg (now part of Karlsruhe).\n\nThe Schütte-Lanz company, founded by Karl Lanz and Johann Schütte in 1909, built 22 airships. The company's main competitor was the Zeppelin works.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Mannheim's industrial plants played a key role in Germany's war economy. This contributed to the fact that, on 27 May 1915, Ludwigshafen was the world's first civilian settlement behind the battle lines to be bombed from the air. French aircraft attacked the BASF plants, thereby killing twelve people. The precedent was set for this attack by Germany's repeated air raids against British civilian populations throughout southeastern Britain during the first half of 1915.\n\nWhen Germany lost the war in 1918, according to the peace terms, the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French troops. The French occupation lasted until 1930, and some of Ludwigshafen's most elegant houses were erected for the officers of the French garrison.\n\nAfter the First World War, the Heinrich Lanz Company built the Bulldog, an advanced tractor, powered by heavy oil. As a result of the invention of the pre-combustion chamber by Prosper L'Orange, Benz & Cie. developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at its motor works in Mannheim in 1923. In 1922, the Grosskraftwerk Mannheim (Mannheim large power station) was opened. By 1930, the city, along with its sister city of Ludwigshafen, which had developed out of the old Mannheim Rheinschanze, had a population of 385,000.\n\nDuring World War II, air raids on Mannheim completely destroyed the city centre. Mannheim was heavily damaged during aerial bombing by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Allied bombing raids razed the city centre of Mannheim at night-time area bombing, killing thousands of civilians. In the meantime, 2,262 of Mannheim's Jews were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Some sources state that the first deliberate strategic bombing of the war occurred at Mannheim during a Royal Air Force night raid on 16 December 1940.[30] Today around one third of the city consists of buildings from before 1950.[31]\n\nIn late March 1945, the Allied ground advance into Germany reached Mannheim, which was potentially well-defended by German forces. However, the German forces abandoned the city and the U.S. 44th Infantry Division entered unopposed on 29 March 1945.[32] There was later a large American military occupation presence in the Mannheim area with up to 10 barracks. The first one shut down in 2007 and the last was closed in 2013 (see United States military installations below).\n\nRebuilding of the city began industriously. Mannheim Palace and the water tower (Wasserturm) eventually were rebuilt and the National Theatre was replaced by a new building at a new location. At the old location, there is a monument to Friedrich Schiller and the Zum Zwischen-Akt pub. The housing shortage led to the development of many new residential areas.\n\nIn 1964, the City Hospital (Städtisches Krankenhaus) became part of the Heidelberg University for Clinical Medicine in Mannheim. In 1967, the University of Mannheim was established in the city.\n\nIn 1975, the Bundesgartenschau (Federal horticulture show) was celebrated in Luisen and Herzogenried parks. A number of pieces of infrastructure were developed for the show: the telecommunications tower and a second bridge across the Rhine (the Kurt Schumacher Bridge) were built, the pedestrian zone was established, the new Rosengarten conference centre was opened and the Aerobus was installed as a temporary transport system.\n\nA number of major projects were completed in the 1980s and 1990s: a planetarium, an extension to the art gallery, the new Reiß Museum, Stadthaus, a new May Market ground, synagogue, mosque, State Museum for Technology and Work, Carl-Benz stadium and the Fahrlach tunnel were opened.\n\nMannheim has lost many industrial jobs, although in the recent past, the city was economically dominated by manufacturing. The city tried in the past to prevent the establishment of service providers by designating some locations as industrial areas. A prime example of the current trend is the construction of the Victoria Tower (Victoria-Turm) in 2001, one of the tallest buildings in the city, on railway land.\n\nMannheim celebrated its 400th anniversary with a series of cultural and other events throughout 2007. The 400th anniversary proper was in 2006, since Frederick IV, Elector Palatine laid the foundations of Mannheim citadel on 17 March 1606. In preparation for the anniversary, some urban activities were implemented, beginning in 2000: the building of the SAP Arena with access to the city's new eastern ring road, the rehabilitation of the pedestrian zone in Breite Straße, the arsenal and the palace, the complete transformation of the old fairground, and the new Schafweide tram line. The concept of the anniversary of the city is aimed at a diverse range of events without a dominant central event. In 2001, the City hospital was officially and legally awarded with the title University Hospital Mannheim. In 2023, Mannheim hosted the Bundesgartenschau 2023 (National Garden Show); the second time after 1975.\n\nMannheim is located in Germany's warmest summer region, the \"Rhine shift\". In summer, temperatures sometimes rise up to 35 °C (95 °F) and higher. The highest recorded temperature was 39.8 °C (104 °F) on 7 August 2015. The daily lows during heat waves can be very high for the latitude (around 25 °C / 77 °F). In September 2016, the average temperature in Mannheim was 18.6 °C, highest in Baden-Württemberg.[36]\n\nIn comparison to other regions of Germany, Mannheim has a higher humidity in summer which causes a higher heat index. Snow is rare, even in the cold months. Precipitation occurs mostly during afternoon thunderstorms during the warmer period (average days of thunderstorms in a year is 40–50). The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate),[37] bordering closely on a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with summer months often averaging above 21 degrees (71 F).\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%1450570— 16633,000+426.3%172915,760+425.3%177725,353+60.9%180218,818−25.8%185224,316+29.2%187139,606+62.9%189079,058+99.6%189597,780+23.7%1900141,131+44.3%1919229,576+62.7%1925247,486+7.8%1933275,162+11.2%1939284,957+3.6%1945186,310−34.6%1950245,634+31.8%1956287,210+16.9%1961313,890+9.3%1966329,301+4.9%1971332,378+0.9%1976309,059−7.0%1981304,219−1.6%1986294,648−3.1%1990310,411+5.3%2001308,385−0.7%2011290,117−5.9%2022313,693+8.1%Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions.\n\nMannheim has a population of about 315,000 and is the 2nd largest city in Baden-Württemberg. Mannheim became a major city in the early 19th century due to its industrialization. Its location of Rhine and Neckar rivers made Mannheim an attractive place for industrialization. Mannheim was heavily destroyed after WWII but became a major industrial city a few years later. In the 1950s the population in Mannheim grew rapidly due to the heavy industrialization where many motor, electronic and power plant companies came to Mannheim and other surrounding cities like Ludwigshafen and Heidelberg. The population of Mannheim started to decline in the 1980s but it started to grow in the 2010s due to its university where many students came to this city and made Mannheim one of the most popular university cities in Germany.\n\nThe following list shows the most significant groups of foreigners in the city of Mannheim by nationalities.[38] In total 44,7% of all Mannheim inhabitants are from foreign descent.

Although founded in 1967, it has its origins in the Palatine Academy of Sciences, established in 1763, and the former Handelshochschule (Commercial College), founded in 1907. Situated in Mannheim Palace, it is Germany's leading university in the fields of business and economics and attracts students from around the world. Described by Die Zeit as the 'Harvard of Germany',[7] it is seen as the training grounds of German business leaders. More than 12,000 students were enrolled in the 2013/14 semester.[51]\n\nThe university town also houses one of the medical schools of Heidelberg University (at the University Hospital Mannheim), the Hochschule Mannheim, a branch of the Duale Hochschule of the State of Baden-Württemberg and several musical and theatrical academies, including the Pop Academy Mannheim, the Musikhochschule and the Theaterakademie. These institutions draw a large and diverse student body.\n\nDependents of U.S. military personnel attended Mannheim Elementary School until it closed in June 2012.[52] In the 1980s the school had 2,200 students.[53]\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Mannheim is known for its exceptional inventive power and was ranked 11th among the Top 15 of the most inventive cities worldwide.[54]\n\nMany significant inventions were made in Mannheim:\n\nKarl Drais built the first two-wheeled draisine in 1817.\n\nKarl Benz drove the first automobile on the streets of Mannheim in 1886. At his workshop in Mannheim, he produced a lightweight three-wheeled vehicle powered by a single cylinder petrol/gasoline-fueled engine, first shown in public during 1886. This powered tricycle subsequently came to be widely regarded as the first automobile/motor car powered by an internal combustion engine. Karl's wife Bertha Benz undertook the world's first road trip by automobile from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back,[55] about 65 miles then, on modern roads about 55 miles, in August 1888.\n\nThe Lanz Bulldog, a popular tractor with a rugged, simple Diesel engine was introduced in 1921.\n\nKarl Benz developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at the Benz & Cie. motor works in Mannheim in 1923.\n\nJulius Hatry built the world's first rocket plane in 1929.\n\nDario Fontanella, an Italian guest worker, invented the first Spaghettieis (spaghetti ice cream) in 1969.\n\nThe world's first bicycle, built in Mannheim by Karl Freiherr von Drais in 1817\n\nThe world's first motorcar, built in Mannheim by Karl Benz in 1885\n\nOfficial sign of Bertha Benz Memorial Route, commemorating the world's first long-distance journey by automobile from Mannheim to Pforzheim in 1888 104 km (65 mi)\n\nThe mayor is the head of the city council and chairman of the council, being selected by direct suffrage for a term of eight years.

Today, diesel engines and buses are assembled there. The Swiss Hoffmann–La Roche diagnostic group (formerly known as Boehringer Mannheim) has its division headquarters in Mannheim.[73] Additionally, the city also hosts large factories, headquarters and/or offices of ABB,[74] IBM,[75] Alstom,[76][77] BASF (Ludwigshafen), Bilfinger Berger,[78] Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever,[79] Essity,[80] Phoenix Group,[81] Bombardier,[82] Pepperl+Fuchs,[83] Caterpillar, Fuchs Petrolub, John Deere, Siemens,[84] SCA, Südzucker, and other companies.

It is served by ICE high-speed train system with connections to Frankfurt am Main–Berlin, Karlsruhe–Basel, and Stuttgart–Munich.

All S-Bahn lines run through Mannheim Hauptbahnhof except S5. Other S-Bahn stations are Mannheim-Rangierbahnhof, Mannheim-Seckenheim, and Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld-Süd.\n\nThe 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge integrated Mannheim/Ludwigshafen tramway network also extends to Heidelberg. It is operated by RNV, a company that is wholly owned by the three cities mentioned and a couple of municipalities in the Palatinate. RNV is the result of a merger on 1 October 2009 between the region's five former municipal transportation companies.[90] Interurban trams are operated by RNV on a triangular route between Mannheim, Heidelberg, and Weinheim that was originally established by the Upper Rhine Railway Company (Oberrheinische Eisenbahn, OEG), and the company also operates interurban trams between Bad Dürkheim, Ludwigshafen, and Mannheim. In the 1970s a proposal to build a U-Bahn out of the Mannheim and Ludwigshafen tramways was begun, but only small sections were built due to lack of funds. The only underground station in Mannheim is the Haltestelle Dalbergstraße. U-Bahn planning now has stopped. All public transport is offered at uniform prices set by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Union, VRN).\n\nThe city centre uses an addressing system that is unique within Germany. Rather than street names and numbers, each block is given a code and a number is given to each building: C3, 17 is block C3, building 17. The practice dates back centuries and is a result of the original use of the city centre as a fort, with the fort's internal system being adopted when it became public streets. The streets themselves are unnamed. The codes are laid out in a simple progressive pattern: C3 is between C2 and C4 in one direction and B3 and D3 in the other. However, those not used to the system will often become lost. A street named Breite Straße goes through the middle of the blocks from south to north, with blocks A-K on the west side of the street and L-U on the east, with each row going 1 to at most 7 based on distance from this road. House numbers begin on the south corner nearest Breite Straße and go counterclockwise for A-K and clockwise for L-U.[91]\n\nThat causes major issues with most mapping software, as the databases that they use are based on the standard street-number system, and so the software cannot accommodate a completely different system for a small area. A variety of fixes have been tried, none with a high level of success. In particular, the systems have issues because an address on a block can be on any of up to four roads and so attempts to fix the issue by giving the roads false names within the database have often failed to give accurate addressing, but such can still be seen on some platforms like Google Maps. Finding an address in the area thus generally requires resorting to asking directions or using one of the many posted public maps.[92]\n\nMannheim is twinned with:[93]\n\nWiederkehr, Gustav: Mannheim in Sage und Geschichte, H.
