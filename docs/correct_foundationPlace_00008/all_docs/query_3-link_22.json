        "text": "A city of elegant squares and constant creativity\n\nBaden-Wuerttemberg's third-largest city, Mannheim possesses an instantly recognizable 18th-century grid pattern, which sets it apart from other German cities. It is also distinguished by its history of invention, giving birth to chemical giant BASF, and providing the stage for Karl Benz to create the first automobile.\n\nMore about Mannheim\n\nHome to over 310,000 people, Mannheim is a business-like city with a significant student population. And it punches above its weight culturally as well. The city is home to the famous Mannheim National Theatre, and outstanding museums such as the Technoseum, and the Reiss-Engelhorn Museum.\n\nStudying and Working in Mannheim\n\nMannheim has two major universities. The most prestigious is the University of Mannheim, which has been labeled the \"Harvard of Germany\" due to its business and economics stature. 20% of students at the university are international, reflecting its outward-looking nature, and its ranking is close to the global top 50 for social sciences.\n\nHochschule Mannheim is the other major university in the city, and focuses on informatics, mathematics, biotech research and other advanced, vocational disciplines. The two institutions complement each other, feeding a stream of graduates into the region's industrial economy.\n\nLocal companies range from pharma giant Hoffmann-la-Roche to tractor-maker John Deere, and engineering corporations like Siemens and Bombardier. So the career prospects for Mannheim students are always very positive, no matter which university students choose."
