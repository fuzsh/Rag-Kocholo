Mannheim attracts companies, students, researchers, skilled workers, business founders and investors alike with its “let’s do it” attitude.\n\nMannheim enjoys an outstanding position as a business location.

An excellent infrastructure as well as attractive industrial and office spaces make Mannheim a top location. Companies enjoy a business-friendly environment and benefit from the support programmes offered by the state of Baden-Württemberg, the federal government and the EU.\n\nMannheimer Wirtschaftsförderung (the Office for Economic Development) is the point of contact and agency 'looking after' all business and economic matters.
