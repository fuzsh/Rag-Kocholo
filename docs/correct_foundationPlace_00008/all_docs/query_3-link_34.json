        "text": "Carbon-Free Energy\n\nBalancing wind, solar and nuclear power will help achieve a carbon-free future and positively impact our changing climate. Over the past 50 years, globally, nuclear power has avoided nearly two years of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions. Imagine how much more carbon pollution we can prevent.\n\nNuclear Energy:\n\nProvides 55% of the U.S.’s and 14% of the world’s carbon-free energy\n\nLearn More\n\nShaping The Future With Reliable Energy\n\nSolar, wind and nuclear energy are essential to a carbon-free future, but the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Nuclear power plants are almost always on, delivering the highest availability energy source and operating at maximum capacity more than 90% of the time.\n\nLearn More\n\nSafety: Getting The Facts Right\n\nWhen it comes to creating a more sustainable planet, the need for renewable energy can’t replace the need for safe energy. With nuclear power, you get the best of both worlds.\n\nThe fact is, it's safe\n\nTruth is, a person working full-time in a nuclear power plant receives less additional radiation in a year than a flight crew or a business traveler with 250 hours of flying time.\n\nLearn More"
