        "text": "The planned acquisition helps SAP expand its business transformation portfolio, giving customers access to the full suite of tools required for continuous business transformation and facilitating AI-enabled process optimisation. LeanIX, a privately held company, has been a strategic partner of SAP and for SAP Signavio solutions for 10 years. Many CIOs rely on LeanIX’s offerings as part of their digital transformation with the RISE with SAP solution.\n\nSAP Signavio: Realign your organisation and bring changes to life at an accelerated rate\n\nLearn more\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nWith the intended acquisition, SAP is extending its comprehensive transformation suite to help customers navigate change more easily and permanently improve their business processes. LeanIX complements the transformation capabilities of SAP Signavio solutions and will give SAP customers the unique clarity on IT landscapes that they need to reap the full benefit of business transformation. The combined offering will provide a comprehensive foundation for AI-enabled process optimisation.\n\nLeanIX’s software-as-a-service offering enables more than 1,000 customers globally to visualise their entire IT application landscape, uncover applications in danger of becoming obsolete, facilitate the design of a target state and help plan new architectural road maps. LeanIX has also recently launched an AI assistant that unlocks the power of generative AI for enterprise architecture management. It increases automation today and sets the foundation for an intelligent recommendation engine for IT landscape transformation in the future.\n\n“Systems and processes go hand in hand,” said Christian Klein, CEO and Member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “Together with LeanIX, we want to offer a first-of-its-kind transformation suite to provide holistic support to our customers on their business transformation journeys. Building on our decades of expertise, we’ll embed generative AI to offer self-optimising applications and processes that can help businesses achieve key goals such as maximising cash flow while minimising their environmental impact.”\n\nSAP’s new business transformation solution suite will give customers a comprehensive view of business processes and applications, including overlaying process dependencies and mapping the impact of potential transformations on the IT landscape. LeanIX’s IT landscape transformation capabilities – together with SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite, RISE with SAP, and SAP Business Technology Platform – will enable SAP customers to create a culture of continuous adaptability and improvement. In addition, LeanIX will continue to serve non-SAP landscapes.\n\n“For more than a decade, we have pursued a relentless customer-centric approach, a commitment to superior usability and seamless ecosystem integration and have become a leader in the enterprise architecture management category,” said André Christ, CEO and co-founder, LeanIX. “Our strategy is to empower organisations to continuously transform in a rapidly changing business environment. With an integrated, comprehensive view of IT applications and business processes we speed up modernisation and reduce transformation risks for our customers, and also secure their ability to adapt to technology shifts such as cloud and AI.”\n\nVisit the SAP News Center.
