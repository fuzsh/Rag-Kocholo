Johann Daniel Hofheintz, also known as Daniel Huffines, was christened in Ebersbach, Hessen, Germany at Margarentkirche Lutheran Church on 26 May 1736 to Johann Jost Hofheintz and his wife, Maria Catharina Opperman. Daniel arrived, along with his brother, Adam, in the port of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 25 Nov 1763. Daniel and Adam settled for a brief time in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and later removed to York County. By 1771, Daniel had married a sister of the Reverend Tobias Wagner, Catherina Wagner, and removed to Surry County, North Carolina where all of their children were born.

Daniel and Catharina had at least eight children, and possibly as many as twelve. (In addition to the eight known children and one suspected child, there were three female children listed in Daniel and Catharina's household in the early censuses of Surry/Stokes counties, North Carolina that have yet to be identified.) This page will list the varying children with links to Ouline Descendency Charts on each of the branches. Though I have made every effort to present the most detailed and accurate information available, there are undoubtedly mistakes in this presentation. Should you find errors, please feel free to contact me so that I can make the appropriate corrections.

Bear in mind that these are only lists of the names and dates of the individuals falling within a certain branch of the Huffines family. For privacy reasons, I have opted not to publically display any information beyond that listed, though I may have extensive information on an individual. Should you desire any additional tidbits on your ancestors, please email directly. I will be more than happy to share what I have privately.
