        "text": "August 5 was the birthday of Hollywood actor Robert Taylor (Spangler Brugh, 1911-1969) and, having mentioned him a couple of dozen times on this blog I feel obligated to give him his own entry, but I confess I find it a chore, as I find watching his movies to be a chore.\n\nOf all the major stars of the classic studio era, I find Taylor among the least interesting to watch. Women and gay men like his looks, and in his earlier films, I can see it. In his movies of the ’30s, he is probably not far behind young Gary Cooper and Cary Grant in that department, and he’s of the same type, the dark hair, fortunate facial features, and so forth. He often wore a mustache, and is sometimes photographed in a manner reminiscent of John Barrymore or John Gilbert. A widow’s peak and enormous pale blue eyes framed by dark lashes sealed the deal. Taylor aged pretty quickly, though, but that’s not the issue. Cooper had also acquired bags under his eyes and puffy jowls and so forth, but he only became more interesting. That is because there was something there to begin with. And while I dislike Taylor’s Ugly American accent, which I associate with the America of the 1950s, it’s not the fact that he’s a midwesterner in and of itself that I find dreary. Like Taylor, Henry Fonda was from Nebraska, and I find Fonda most engaging. No, Robert Taylor is just really, really boring. Stiff, monotonous in his speech, the kind of presence I normally refer to as a fireplace log or cigar store Indian. At best, he was a star, not an actor. Most of the articles I’ve come across about him are by fans, as opposed to critics. One described him as “an amazingly versatile actor”, which has to be dismissed as LOL laughable. “Versatile” befits the chameleon sort of actor, like Olivier, or Alec Guinness, whose entire personality and appearance alters from role to role. Robert Taylor is more like one of those lawn decorations (a gnome, a jockey) that frat boy pranksters move from yard to yard, occasionally adorning it with different hats.\n\nTaylor was scouted as a youngster, performing roles in college and community theatre in the L.A. area. In the films of his early period he was cast opposite much stronger female stars, and in those films, I always remember the actresses and not him. These include the original version of Magnificent Obsession (1935) with Irene Dunne, the 1936 version of Camille with Greta Garbo, and two pictures with Vivien Leigh, A Yank at Oxford (1938) and the 1940 remake of Waterloo Bridge. It is much more common for men to be the stars of movies, with a nondescript but gorgeous woman as the co-star. In Taylor’s case, as with many of the so-called Latin Lovers, the genders were flipped. Her Cardboard Lover (1942) with Norma Shearer (based on the same play as Buster Keaton’s The Passionate Plumber) was one of the last of these kind of vehicles for Taylor (and ’tis well, for he was probably at his most inept in comedy).\n\nIn 1936 Taylor worked with Barbara Stanwyck in His Brother’s Wife. Four years older, she was to become Taylor’s partner and mentor, and from 1939 to 1952, his wife. (She had divorced the abusive Frank Fay in 1935). Stanwyck’s matron of honor at her wedding to Taylor was Marion Marx, Zeppo’s wife. Taylor’s best man was Stanwyck’s brother-in-law, and later personal assistant Buck Mack, of the vaudeville team Miller and Mack. Mack was a bit player who was in The Marx Brothers’ At the Circus the year Stanwyck and Taylor married. From then ’til now, there was widespread speculation that the Taylor-Stanwycks had a lavender marriage. Both had been rumored to be gay, and from a business standpoint, such a liaison could put such rumors to rest. There’s lots of chatter for and against, but I have no dog in that fight.\n\nMy favorite Robert Taylor movies to watch, although they’re just as dull as Taylor himself, are the Biblical and historical costume epics he appeared in during the 1950s: Quo Vadis (1950), Ivanhoe (1952), Knights of the Round Table (1953), and Valley of the Kings (1954). They’re all shot in color. The first two were among his biggest films, are fairly memorable, and come close to what we think of as enduring if minor classics. They’re marred by Taylor’s mortifying American accent, and they’re long and tedious, with none of the charm and humor of The Adventures of Robin Hood or the thrills of The Ten Commandments, but they are nice to look at.\n\nHaving grown up in Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri, Taylor seems much more at home in westerns, and this may be the genre in which he had the widest imprint. As a western star he is not unlike Gary Cooper or Randolph Scott, though his films are more reminiscent of the latter’s than the former’s. The lead in Billy the Kid (1941) is one of the better known of these, though he was vastly too old for the part. Others included Ambush (1950), Westward the Women (1951), Ride Vaquero (1953), The Law and Jake Wade (1958), The Hangman (1959), Cattle King (1963), and Return of the Gunfighter (1967).\n\nLike many stars of the era, Taylor served in World War Two, and starred in many battle pictures, the best known of which is Bataan (1943). Like Stanwyck, Taylor was a conservative Republican, and among those who were vociferous anti-communists during the Cold War. As film work started to dry up, he turned to television, starring in a program called The Detectives (1959-62), and later taking over for his pal Ronald Reagan as the host of the western show Death Valley Days (1966-69). (Reagan was of course Governor of California during those years)."
