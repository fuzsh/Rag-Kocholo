        "text": "Just a cursory glance at her childhood I think might provide an explanation why she was a shit mother (her real name is Ruby): When Ruby was four, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. Two weeks after the funeral, her father joined a work crew digging the Panama canal; and was never seen again. Ruby and her brother Byron were raised by their sister Mildred, who was five years older than Ruby. When Mildred got a job as a John Cort showgirl, Ruby and Byron were placed in a series of foster homes (as many as four in a year), from which Ruby often ran away. Ruby attended various public schools in Brooklyn, where she received uniformly poor grades and routinely picked fights with the other students... [wikipedia]\n\n[quote]She's my favorite actress. But from what I've read, she was a far worse parent than Joan Crawford.%0D %0D Not true. Stanwyck had had to be a very tough lady to survive in her life and was emotionally incapable of relating a needy child. It was a bad idea for her and the drunk and wife-beating Fay to adopt Dion as a way to shore up their shaky marriage. Stanwyck never beat up Dion - she just couldn't be \"maternal\" with him and the kid couldn't measure up to her standard of toughness.%0D %0D By all accounts, when Taylor came along, he tried to be a good dad to the child. Taylor, however, was athletic and outdoorsy and Dion was fat, uncoordinated, and unprepossessing.%0D %0D When he got older, Dion was busted a couple of times for selling porn. Stanwyck bailed him out and paid his legal fees but they parted company.\n\n\"Around the time Barbara was receiving her last gestures of praise from critics, her treatment of Anthony Dion was becoming public knowledge. With the release of her daughterâs 1978 book and ludicrous 1981 movie adaptation, Joan Crawfordâs reputation was in ruins. Why shouldnât Barbaraâs be? After all, Dion had legitimate complains next to Christina Crawfordâs bullshitted attempt to gain pity from the American public. Dion was about to bring the skeletons out of his closet, and reveal in a tell-all book about the rejection and humiliation that he had endured as a child. What he realized that Christina Crawford did not was that he was complaining about a mother who had been raised on abandonment and abuse. Dionâs speaking out about his childhood was done from a much more sensitive and sympathetic manner, telling reporters, â..perhaps if we meet once more, we can both live the rest of our lives in peace.â She refused to see him, and kept only one picture of him locked away in a closet where no one else could find it. Barbara had officially rejected Dion for good by rejecting him from her life entirely. By the time the scandal had reached tabloid headlines, they had not seen or spoken to each other in decades.\"\n\nDion, not true, she loved you more. but unlike the Big V. sons, you were indicative of her successes and failures and she couldnt bear to look upon that. easier to shut you out, than deal with it all---emotionally crippling on top of all the YEARS of heartache that she never dealt with from the loss of a mother and father. If she didnt care for you deeply she could look at you, see you, etc., with little or no affect on her. it was HER shortcomings, not yours, that caused her to do what she did and handle it the way she did. When the human psyche has no more room for pain, it shuts down. some very good counseling could have helped tremendously. you MUST forgive her and let the pain go. Ask God to do this with you, for if you dont you will carry this burden to your grave thinking YOU did something wrong. She had just reached her limit in emotional strength and you, the innocent casualty of this. if you are still living and seek happiness and peace- try this. make your peace with your maker and ask that He forgive her and then you. love her and accept her for what she was-fractured, weak emotionally that is why acting was so easy for her. she could leave her prblems outside, not deal with them and get volumes of accolades and kudos without having to really develop herself. my guess is she had PTSD and a broken heart, and lived with it all her life.\n\nR27 that was a bit far-fetched. How ever there is some possibility to be true since everything is possible in this funny life.\n\nR26, i have seen 'Clash By Night' and i can say that it is undoubtedly a good movie. It's a Fritz Lang film and Barbara has an interesting role here. Marilyn too! However Barbara's character has more edges that Marilyn's in that one. Marilyn was so sympathetic. It really surprises me that many Dataloungers trash her. She was just a tortured woman with a lot of nightmares in her beautiful head.\n\nAnd lol R26, i have no idea what happened between those two ladies on the set of this movie. It would be interesting to know some stories about that though, yeah!\n\n\"Read \"The secret life of Humphrey Bogart\" the early years (1899-1931) by Darwin Porter\"\n\nUm, you mean you actually BELIEVE Darwin Porter's hilariously fake Hollywood gossip? If so, you are one incredibly gullible, uninformed queen.\n\nAnyway, Stanwyck and Fay should never have adopted a child. They only did it to shore up their marriage.\n\nA good biography of Stanwyck by Axel Madsen claims that Barbara insisted on adopting a child, thinking it would improve her marriage to Frank Fay. The book suggests that they adopted because Stanwyck could not have children, possibly because she was damaged internally by an illegal abortion or abortions:\n\n\"During her teenage years and early twenties she had avoided stag parties but shimmied in speakeasies, danced in chorus lines on the road, cadged meals at LaHiff's, impressed Williard Mack and Arthur Hopkins, and fallen in love with Rex Cherryman, all without getting pregnant. Or had she? Contraception was crude in the 1920s. Barbara would never admit to an abortion, nor would she ever bear a child. An unwanted pregnancy was the chorus girl's curse--her friend Crawford admitted to four abortions--and for Barbara and Rex, enjoying their first flush of success, a pregnancy would have been devastating. There can be no doubt that she would have done whatever it took not to let the brass ring slip from her grasp, including an abortion.\"\n\n\"Frank didn't want to adopt a child. To him fatherhood had to be biological. But Barbara insisted.\"\n\n\"Once home on Briston Avenue, Barbara and Frank named their son Anthony Dion and happily played house. For a brief time they bent over the crib in awe and self-congratulation, but within weeks the infant was left in the care of a succession of nurses and nannies. Stanwyck talked of baby Dion as a fullfillment and reminded reporters that she'd been an orphan herself. She would like to adopt a slew of orphans and surround them with love, she told Photoplay.\"\n\n\"It was all a facade. Barbara put in long days, six days a week at the studio, and her husband's brooding and drinking didn't stop. Frank whined that he was sacrificing his career for hers. She couldn't stand to see Frank unhappy, and against her better judgement, all too often gave in to him. After he threw Dion into the swimming pool in a rage, the nanny locked herself and the toddler into the nursery when he was home.'\n\nI know she had a super rough childhood, and she was poor and fought her way in life. She was considered a real survivor. she was well loved on the set of Big Valley. Linda Evens said she lost her mother and she was crying on the set. Barbara asked her what's wrong? She told her her mother died and Barbara said I'll be your mother and you can talk to me anytime.\n\nThe Barbara Stanwyck fans cans practically every biography that comes out on her, especially when the author makes the claim she was bisexual,wow! look out! They most be the same people on IMBD message boards.\n\nI think Susie Lee said that there was some incident that pointed out that Barbara Stanwyck was a lesbian, but I forgot the story. Dose anyone remember what Susie Lee said? So Hugh Hefner said Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor were bisexual? What else dose that world famous pimp know?\n\n\"There's a new 1,000 page biography coming out in the fall, and it's only Part 1! She must have been a real bitch to warrant a 2 part biography.\"\n\nI've just finished reading it. Robert Taylor comes off in he book as the ultimate mama's boy. After he and Stanwyck were married by a JP, he left Barbara to rush to his mother's house to inform her of the marriage, but she had already heard the news on the radio and was distraught. Taylor spent his wedding night in bed with his mother, holding her as she sobbed until she fell asleep. Stanwyck would complain to friends that she wished Taylor were more of a man and not so weak.\n\n\"Maybe her kid was a pain in the ass.\"\n\nSo? You sound just like Crawford apologists. An adult is not on the same level as a kid, and he/she should act like an adult no matter how obnoxious the child is. A child's behavior does not make him deserve being neglected or mis-treated from parents. A movie stars' bad family background does not excuse their behavior as a parent. And how well liked they are at work is no indication of how bad they are at home.\n\nStanwyck was a shitty parent. When she was tired of being a shitty parent, she threw the kid away. No excuses."
