        "text": "Private Lives\n\nFay’s End, Robert Taylor (His Brother’s Wife, This Is My Affair, The Night Walker), Robert Wagner\n\nOscar Levant described Frank Fay’s influence over Stanwyck during their marriage as “suffocating and total.” In a drunken rage, he once threw their adopted baby, Dion, into their pool. When he knocked Stanwyck down in front of a screaming Dion (after she had admitted going to a burlesque show), she finally felt that enough was enough and asked for a divorce in 1935. There was a custody battle for Dion, and when Stanwyck won it, Fay seems to have lost interest in the boy. Fay would sometimes drunkenly call and plead with Stanwyck to come back to him; she finally stopped accepting his calls. As an old woman, Stanwyck admitted to a reporter that if she had one thing to do over again in her life, she wouldn’t have married Frank Fay. Early in their marriage, she had said, “Gee, it’s swell to have somebody to talk to, somebody who can stand between you and the world,” but the protectiveness she liked in him all too soon became smothering and abusive.\n\nIn the forties, Fay pulled himself together and made a comeback on stage in Mary Chase’s Harvey, as a man who has an imaginary rabbit as a friend. Tallulah Bankhead said that it was “one of the greatest performances I’ve seen,” and raved about the way Fay did “a long speech in the last act which just made me cry.” So let’s give this devil his due. He probably did accomplish one really fine thing in the theater, though James Stewart got to do the movie version of the play. Well into Fay’s successful run of Harvey, columnist Earl Wilson asked Stanwyck if she had seen it. She said no. He asked if she was going to see it, and her reply was withering—and funny: “A long time ago I saw all the rabbits Frank Fay had to offer.”\n\nHer agent, Zeppo Marx, and his wife Marion played matchmaker after her divorce from Fay and set her up with a young up-and-coming actor from MGM, Robert Taylor. Four years younger than Stanwyck, Taylor was totally dominated by his mother, a Silver Cord type of manipulator who complained of her health in order to keep him under her control. Stanwyck called Taylor “Junior,” and he called her “Queen,” and they went out on social dates for a while. Jean Harlow was meant to star opposite Taylor in His Brother’s Wife (1936), a convoluted melodrama, but MGM paired him instead with Stanwyck to capitalize on their courtship publicity.\n\nTaylor enters the film in a tuxedo, and he’s supposed to be drunk. He isn’t as bad as he is during his extended drunk scene in John Stahl’s Magnificent Obsession (1935), which made him a star—but he isn’t much better. This is the brief period when Taylor is at least technically good-looking, but there’s already something wolfish and downright nasty about his manner—in close-up, there’s a creepy and even Dracula-esque quality about his face, as if his hooded eyes were wearing eye shadow. Stanwyck plays a mannequin who’s good at gambling, and she looks at Taylor with interest at times—wonderingly, speculatively—while he barely seems to notice her. That’s part of what makes him such an obnoxiously poor actor; he always delivers his lines in a hearty, bluff fashion that often deteriorates into discordant displays of ill-temper, which never seem merited by the situations in his movies.\n\nTaylor spent more than twenty years at MGM, and he suited that studio’s inattention to nuance and its glossy, respectable surfaces, whereas Stanwyck was too honest and exploratory to fit into the house style. When she gets upset in the early sections of His Brother’s Wife, her truthful acting disrupts the whole apparatus of the film. “Too bad she had no dignity,” she says when she realizes Taylor is casting her aside. She pulls back and sees herself in the third person, distancing herself from the scene and the movie itself to give us a demonstration of how people deal with extreme trauma. In a moment like this, Stanwyck’s inventiveness can be awe-inspiring, but there isn’t much she can do to save the rest of the fast-paced film.\n\nThis is MGM, so a key plot turn whereby her heroine gets revenge takes place mostly off-screen (to preserve audience sympathy for her character, presumably), and when she suffers in the tropics and then becomes a human guinea pig to test a serum to cure spotted fever … well, as Taylor’s father (Jean Hersholt) says, “Love! It puzzles me more than science.” More revealing is an earlier scene where gambling house owner Fish Eye (Joseph Calleia) looks at Stanwyck and says, “What surprises me is why a swell-looking girl like you always falls for a piker.” She has no answer for that one, and it would take an expert psychoanalyst to get to the bottom of Stanwyck’s own consistently bad taste in men.\n\nAt one point in their second team effort, Taylor actually says the title, This Is My Affair (1937), and he gets top billing and most of the plot of the movie, a tale of espionage supposedly based on a true story and set during the McKinley administration. More assured and less objectionable here, Taylor even pulls off an intimate love scene with Stanwyck, lying on his back and opening his mouth when she kisses him. As a fancy dance hall singer, Stanwyck has little to do but look pretty, albeit in a softer way than usual. The whole film presents her face carefully, “beautifully,” in just the way Capra righteously rejected when he went for the truth of her being in Ladies of Leisure.\n\nShe sings a song, “I Hear a Waltz,” in her own husky voice, and it sounds a little strange—she wanders off pitch sometimes, which might be part of the reason she barred Taylor from watching her do this scene. His vaunted male beauty made her self-conscious in the worst possible way, which is probably why she seems concerned with her physical appearance in this picture to the exclusion of all else. Director William Seiter was more at home with romantic comedy, and he lets Sidney Blackmer make Teddy Roosevelt into a thin caricature while observing the uneasy romance between his stars.\n\nSheilah Graham wrote an exposé in January 1939 for Photoplay called “Hollywood’s Unmarried Husbands and Wives,” which included Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, as well as Stanwyck and Taylor. If Graham hadn’t written this article, Stanwyck and Taylor most likely wouldn’t have gotten married, but her piece enraged MGM head Louis B. Mayer, and he insisted that Taylor marry Stanwyck at once. They tied the knot, and Taylor spent his wedding night with his hysterical mother and her heart palpitations. On their brief honeymoon, they stayed with Moss and Kitty Carlisle Hart in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Once back in Hollywood, they had separate bedrooms.\n\nIn 1941, when he was making Johnny Eager, Taylor told his nubile young co-star, Lana Turner, that he respected Stanwyck but didn’t love her, and Taylor and Turner had some kind of romance. Taylor told Stanwyck about it. She fled their home for a few days and stayed with her maid Harriet Corey, then came back. On October 7, 1941, Stanwyck was rushed to the hospital with wounds on her wrists. The story was that she had accidentally shoved her hands through a window, but it sounds like a suicide attempt.\n\nNineteen forty-one was the year of The Lady Eve and Ball of Fire, Stanwyck’s two best comedies. Both films revolved around her sexual attractiveness and mastery over men. Yet at home, she was caught up in a marriage that was at least partly a sham. She was hurt when her younger husband chased a more obvious young sexpot to prove himself as a man, for he saw Stanwyck as another mother figure to rebel against. But if this marriage was more an arrangement than a love match, why was Stanwyck disturbed enough to attempt suicide? Could it be that she had fallen a bit in love with Taylor—or in love, at least, with the idea of them as a couple? Or was his infidelity with Turner just a convenient breaking point that allowed her to act on something that had always been inside of her?\n\nTo our knowledge, she never attempted suicide again, and indeed, her whole image goes against such an action, so the fact that she once went so far to try to escape from living is bewildering. This marriage to Taylor is tricky to read, but it does seem to have been humiliating in a different fashion from her tormented union with the dominating Fay. She could assert herself over Taylor as she couldn’t with Fay; Taylor was weak-willed. And maybe that suicide attempt wasn’t truly serious; maybe she did it to make Taylor feel guilty so that he would stay with her. That’s an ugly interpretation, but her actions had some effect. He did stay.\n\nTaylor and Stanwyck’s main problem was that he liked to go off on hunting trips with his male friends, and she didn’t like to go along—he loved flying his plane, too, and she was scared of flying. World War II gave him an out. He was away for years fighting and enjoying macho camaraderie, while she stayed at home. There have always been rumors that Taylor was gay. My guess is that he was so repressed on this score it never impinged on his consciousness. When he was presented with the sexiest women in the world, women like Turner and later Ava Gardner, he had affairs with them, but it sounds like on some level he was forcing himself.\n\nWhen Taylor got back from the service, the couple went on a trip to Europe in 1947 that worked out very badly. It was only a matter of time before they split, and they did so for good in 1951. My grandmother, who was divorced from her husband, would always ruefully repeat to me, “Barbara Stanwyck was too bossy. That’s why she lost Robert Taylor. I read that somewhere, once.” The Taylor-Stanwyck divorce in 1951 and the reasons for it had penetrated my grandmother’s consciousness as a kind of object lesson.\n\nTaylor had taken up with starlets on the set of Quo Vadis? (1951), but most of them were just seeking publicity, and publicity, finally, is what his marriage to Stanwyck was all about. Whatever their arrangement, it seemed to work for Stanwyck, and she never really got over losing it. She liked that she had a movie star husband so many women found attractive. Her marriage reflected well on her, even if their personal relationship was barely functional. When you work as much as she did, you just need someone who can squire you to social events and do interviews with reporters. Stanwyck wanted to hold onto their united front, and Taylor wanted to escape. He was tired of being used and manipulated, and on this score, at least, he deserves some sympathy.\n\nLater on, thirty or so years after the fact, Stanwyck explained their divorce this way: “He wanted it and I’m not the kind of person who wants somebody if he doesn’t want me. I just say, ‘There’s the door, you can open it. You’ve got a good right hand, just turn the knob, that’s all you have to do. If you can’t open it, I’ll do it for you.’” Bitterness creeps into that statement, but it’s in the hardboiled Stanwyck manner; she could have played that scene in one of her movies. Yet at the time Taylor pressed her for a divorce, she was broken up about it, and she stayed broken up, on some level, for the rest of her life. To stick it to him, she vengefully demanded alimony and kept collecting it until he died in 1969.\n\nStrangely, years after the divorce, Taylor was again top billed but entirely subjugated to Stanwyck in her last feature film, the William Castle “shocker,” The Night Walker (1964). The amiably naïve Castle no doubt saw the exploitation value in having the divorced Taylor and Stanwyck star together in one of his movies. As ever, they don’t have any particular chemistry as an on-screen pair (even when she slaps him, the act has practically no impact), but the film is involving in its modest way. It starts with some bargain basement Salvador Dali images and a silly/scary voiceover about dreams (they bring out our secret desires for sex and murder, apparently). At first, Stanwyck looks tired, spreading her arms for Taylor in their first scene and saying, “Isn’t this romantic?” when it’s anything but. Yet in the following scenes, it becomes clear that Stanwyck has made tiredness a choice for her character, a passive, delirious type who’s easy to manipulate. This choice is one final proof of Stanwyck’s range.\n\nAn elegantly creepy score by Vic Mizzy keeps things moving, and Stanwyck has fun with her juicy role, especially when she gets to scream in horror. Her first set of screams sound succulent, even orchestral, a Phil Spector wall of sound (she ends the last one on a smoker’s hacking cough). Later on she does another set of basso yowls, this time putting her whole body into it and throwing her head back to punctuate one of her screams. Best of all, when her tormented dreamer realizes what a jam she’s in, Stanwyck decides to amuse herself and us by going all-out hambone. “I can’t wake up,” she says, breathlessly, letting it sink in. “I can’t wake up!” she cries, making the realization louder and more uncontrolled. And then, “I CAN’T WAKE U-h-h-h-h-h-a-HUP!” she howls, putting both arms over her face like some bygone great lady of the stage.\n\nThe last half hour gets a little too drowsy, so that the audience might fall asleep with Stany. It’s nothing to win a prize on, but The Night Walker is not at all embarrassing, unlike the horror features of the time that annihilated Davis, Crawford, Olivia de Havilland, Tallulah Bank-head, Miriam Hopkins, and a score of others. Stanwyck came out of her 1960s horror experience unscathed partly because she didn’t have the kind of strong, one-note star persona that could be easily trashed. Even in this genre, she’s fresh, alert, and inventive, whereas the peevish Taylor has entered into Bela Lugosi territory—at the end, he takes off a ghoulish mask, but his overly made-up, lined face underneath is far more disturbing. When asked about working with his ex-wife, Taylor said, “It’s as if we were never married,” and it certainly seems that way on screen.\n\n“I’m supposed to be a hermit,” Stanwyck laughed, in the 1960s, “a loner nursing a broken heart because I lost Robert Taylor …. I don’t think anybody’s hilariously happy living alone, but you learn to adjust.” Again, this is tricky to read. She’s able to step outside of the supposed narrative of her life and comment on it, as if it’s a script she’s thinking about accepting, but where does real feeling come in? Stanwyck probably couldn’t separate that out herself, so there’s no way that we can, either. When she attended Taylor’s memorial, she wore a yellow dress, because he had once told her that he didn’t want her in black at his funeral. She cried openly and loudly during the service, which wasn’t her usual stoic style. Stanwyck was crying for a real man who had died, of course, a man that she had known and maybe even loved, in her way. But I think it’s fair to say that she always loved the idea of them together more than the reality—which was perfectly pleasant after the nightmare of Frank Fay, but never more than a movie-type deal, at least on his side.\n\nIt’s clear, however, that Stanwyck really loved her brother Byron, and she made sure that as an older man he had work. Leslie Caron remembers:\n\nStanwyck’s brother Byron was an extra on my film The Glass Slipper (1954). We worked on a scene where I’m introduced to the princely court in the great ballroom—I had to step down this long staircase wearing a huge ball dress and the court was massed at the foot of the stairs. Byron stood a little forward from the rest, in a prominent position. He immediately struck me as a hopeless alcoholic, his face very red and his features deformed by alcohol. Strangely, it was evident to me that the assistants were favoring him so it would be impossible to complete the scene without calling him the next day. I asked why this man was getting this treatment of favor. I was told in a discrete way that he was Barbara Stanwyck’s brother and that he needed any help he could get. My shock and pain at hearing this were immense. In Hollywood the sense of hierarchy was very strong, it was measured by your success and the salary you earned, the car you drove, the neighborhood you lived in. An extra was way down on the lower rung of the ladder, lower than the craftsmen and the crew while the stars stood at the very top. Democracy didn’t exist on a movie set. The huge gulf that separated brother and sister was all the more shocking.\n\nIt’s a measure of how much Stanwyck was loved by her crew that they made special allowances for the one person from her childhood who had made her feel secure, even though he seemed to be in bad shape by the early 1950s.\n\nRobert Wagner’s recent memoir, Pieces of My Heart, has opened a new door on Stanwyck’s personal life during the period immediately following her divorce from Taylor. After the making of Titanic (1953), Wagner says that he took Stanwyck home from a party, and at the door he was met with “a magical look of interest … and appreciation … and desire.” They danced, they drank champagne; he left at dawn. Eventually, she gave Wagner his own keys to her home, and they spent weekends together when they were both in town. Their four-year relationship had to be kept secret owing to the difference in their ages (he was in his early twenties and she was in her mid-forties).\n\n“She cooked for me,” Wagner remembers. “She was good in the kitchen, but then she was good everywhere.” He says that she was highly sexed and had a lot on her mind. She made regular visits to a psychiatrist who prescribed her sodium pentothal to calm her down (she was a coffee addict and rarely able to get the sleep she needed). “Like so many people in show business, she was a prisoner of her career,” he writes. That assessment sounds about right, though I would probably change his characterization of Stanwyck to “willing prisoner.” Now, there is a small chance that Wagner is gilding the lily about what they had together. In his own recent memoir, Farley Granger related a self-serving story about a one-night stand with Stanwyck in the early fifties. The story doesn’t sound particularly believable as Granger tells it, but there are a lot of helpful, pertinent details in Wagner’s Stanwyck chapter. He thinks that because of his youth and good looks, he brought her a confidence that she had lost being married to Taylor. I can only hope that this was the case.\n\nWagner says that she owned some of her own movies, and so they would sometimes watch these films together. She screened Union Pacific (1939) for him, and Ball of Fire, and even Baby Face, during which she let him know what it had been like to work for that movie’s producer, Darryl Zanuck. “Barbara told me that Darryl had chased her around his office … and I got the distinct impression that she hadn’t appreciated the exercise.” Zanuck just wanted a piece of her, of course, yet his unwanted passes put her in exactly the right state of mind to play Lily Powers; maybe Zanuck sensed as much on some level. Stanwyck told Wagner about how mean Al Jolson was to her when she was starting out, and Wagner thinks that it might have been Jolson who gave her those cigarette burns on her chest.\n\nThe relationship with Wagner, whatever it was, couldn’t really go anywhere because of their age difference, so finally Stanwyck called it off. Of her later years, Wagner says, “I don’t know who the men in her life were, although I’m sure they existed. I know she had escorts, although I assumed most of them were gay.” Stanwyck said in her later years, “Oh, yes, sometimes I have to go to something or other. When I do, I just call good ol’ Butch [Cesar] Romero and he says rather reluctantly, ‘Well, if you HAVE to go, I’ll take you.’ He does that for all of us old broads.”\n\nWagner wanted to see Stanwyck in the hospital when she was dying, but she advised him to remember her in her prime. As she died, he says, Stanwyck was wearing a four-leaf clover necklace he had given her. On-screen, Wagner looks to me nearly as shifty and unpleasant as Robert Taylor, but off-screen, he seems to have shored up a lot of Stanwyck’s broken pride."
