        "text": "An epic life of Barbara Stanwyck - and it's just Vol. 1\n\nCelebrity biographies are rarely as long and dense as Victoria Wilson's nearly 900-page tome about screen star Barbara Stanwyck (Volume 1, no less, ending right before World War II).\n\nSuch ambitious studies are reserved for important political or historical legends, written by the likes of Robert Caro or David McCullough. And Stanwyck (Stella Dallas, Double Indemnity) is not in the same glam class as Katharine Hepburn or Bette Davis.\n\nBut that's the point: Stanwyck (1907-1990) was a more grounded and relatable actress, who hated the industry glamour and preferred playing tough yet sensitive working-class characters. Her career spanned the ups and downs of Hollywood during its fastest-growing period, from the beginning of sound in the late '20s to the arrival of TV three decades later.\n\nAnd Victoria Wilson, a publishing heavyweight as senior editor at Knopf, weaves an exhaustive and epic Hollywood narrative about the craft, politics and business of the industry, with Stanwyck at its center. The biographer spent 15 years researching and writing the Stanwyck story, and it's a compelling, if complicated, read.\n\nThere are many tangents along the way, and you could argue that it's overwrought. But be patient -- it's worth the journey. We not only learn about Stanwyck's American Dream, but also the cultural significance of her work and profession.\n\nStanwyck was an orphan from Brooklyn whose pretty looks and slim physique landed her a career as a dancer and chorus girl on Broadway. She fell in love and married the gifted vaudevillian monologist Frank Fay, and they moved to Hollywood. He was older and more sophisticated and the most attentive man she'd ever met.\n\nBut their marriage was the tragic and abusive stuff of A Star is Born, and Stanwyck divorced him in the late '30s and took custody of their adopted son, Dion. Stanwyck later married Robert Taylor (Camille), Hollywood's hottest star at MGM in the late '30s, and Stanwyck helped groom his successful career, turning an uncertain actor into a confident pro. They were more kindred spirits in upbringing and personality.\n\nIn terms of Stanwyck's movie career, although she worked with many talented directors (in Volume 1 that includes William Wellman, George Stevens, King Vidor, Cecil B. DeMille), the most important was Frank Capra. He was blown away by her naturalism in an early screen test she made with Hungarian director Alexander Korda, who struggled in Hollywood during the transition to sound. According to Capra, \"She was the greatest emotional actress the screen has yet known.\"\n\nCapra groomed Stanwyck, cast her in several of his early movies (The Miracle Woman) and briefly fell in love with her. This paved the way for Stella Dallas, her Oscar-nominated ode to motherhood in 1937. Volume 1 ends with the director and star reunited in Meet John Doe, in which she plays a cynical journalist pitted against the idealistic Everyman played by Gary Cooper.\n\nThat means we'll have to wait for Volume 2 to learn about her experiences making The Lady Eve with Preston Sturges and Double Indemnity with Billy Wilder -- and the rest of her life.\n\nA Life of Barbara Stanwyck: Steel-True, 1907-1940\n\nBy Victoria Wilson\n\nSimon & Schuster, 860 pp.\n\n***1/2"
