        "text": "Barbara Stanwyck\n\n(1907 â€“ 1990)\n\nPersonality, Drama, Mystery, and Comedy Programs\n\nJuly 16, 1907 - January 20, 1990\n\n\"The Best Actress Who Never Won an Oscar.\"\n\nOne of the most versatile and great performers of all time, Barbara Stanwyck entertained for 59 years of her life. She long yearned to perform and quit her job at the telephone company to become a high kicking chorus girl with her older sister. Lucky for us she never returned to the phone company and became one of the greatest performers of all time. In 1928 she moved with her then husband, Frank Fay to Hollywood to seek fame. Her memorable performances include the wicked Phyllis Dietrichson in Double Indemnity, the unforgettable frank and strong Stella Dallas, the very funny Lee Leander in Remember the Night, and countless more.\n\nShe remarked on her performances, \"My only problem is finding a way to play my fortieth fallen female in a different way from my thirty-ninth.\"\n\nThough her nickname on the set was \"Sissy and \"The Queen, she was known for being hardworking and unpretentious with others. Sally Field and other actors of our time look to her as an exemplar actress and studied her performances and in 1982 she received an honorary Academy Award.This collection included her performances on radio including her Lux Theatre versions of her most popular films, Lady Eve, Stella Dallas, Lucille Fletcher's Sorry, Wrong Number (not to be confused with Agnes Moorehead's performance on Suspense), and many more. She also appeared on the Jack Benny Program, Blue Ribbon Town, and Burns and Allen.\n\nThis collection also includes an extras folder with publicity head shots and film stills which illustrate further her versatility and magnificence."
