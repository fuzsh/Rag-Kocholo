        "text": "Barbara Stanwyck (born July 16, 1907, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 20, 1990, Santa Monica, California) was an American motion-picture and television actress who played a wide variety of roles in more than 80 films but was best in dramatic parts as a strong-willed, independent woman of complex character.\n\nStanwyck was effectively orphaned as a small child when her mother died and her father almost immediately abandoned the family. She was raised partly by an elder sister and partly in foster care. Her formal education did not extend past eighth grade, and she began working when she was 13 years old. She became a chorus girl at the age of 15 and danced in nightclubs and in touring companies, including the Ziegfield Follies. She was chosen to play the role of a cabaret dancer in the Broadway play The Noose in 1926, and, at the suggestion either of the play’s producer or of impresario David Belasco, she adopted the name Barbara Stanwyck. Her performance in the leading role in Burlesque (1927) won praise and resulted in movie offers.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nStanwyck’s first credited film role was a leading part in The Locked Door in 1929. Neither that movie nor Mexicali Rose that same year was a success, but her breakthrough came with the early Frank Capra movie Ladies of Leisure (1930). She went on to appear in more than 80 films in a variety of genres. Her movies included the dramas Baby Face (1933), Forbidden (1932), and Golden Boy (1939); the comedies Remember the Night (1940) and The Lady Eve (1941); and the westerns Union Pacific (1939) and Cattle Queen of Montana (1954). Other notable films were Meet John Doe (1941), The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946), Clash by Night (1952), and Executive Suite (1954).\n\nStanwyck received Academy Award nominations for her performances as a mother who sacrifices her own happiness for that of her daughter in the melodrama Stella Dallas (1937) and as the nightclub singer Sugarpuss O’Shea in the comedy Ball of Fire (1941). She was also nominated for her portrayals of a femme fatale in the noir thriller Double Indemnity (1944) and of a bedridden woman who discovers a murder plot in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). Although she never won a competitive Oscar, she received an honorary award in 1982."
