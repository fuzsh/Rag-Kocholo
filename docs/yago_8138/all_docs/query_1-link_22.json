        "text": "When she was awarded an Honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement, the statuette was presented to her by John Travolta who later confessed that the experience was his supreme Oscar moment. Stanwyck had been a Travolta family favorite for years. (1982)\n\nThroughout her career she was known for her kindness and patience with younger performers. Marilyn Monroe, who worked with Stanwyck in the 1952 film Vor dem neuen Tag (1952) said that Stanwyck was the only member of Hollywood's older generation who was kind to her.\n\nLived near Joan Crawford during her marriage to Frank Fay. According to Christina Crawford, between 1932 and 1934, Stanwyck would escape from the alcoholic and volatile Fay when things got too hot by scaling a fence on their property. She would stay with Crawford, who lived across the street, until the heat died down. Stanwyck and Crawford had been friends since the days when they were single young actresses and remained friends until Crawford's death.\n\nWilliam Holden was considered to be too lightweight for the lead role in Golden Boy (1939), but Stanwyck urged producers to keep him in the picture, and the role made him a star. In 1978, at the The 50th Annual Academy Awards (1978), before starting the presentation of the sound award, Holden publicly thanked her for what she did. She nearly broke down in tears and kissed Holden, and the exchange received thunderous audience applause.\n\nOn October 27, 1981, Stanwyck was awakened by a burglar at 1:00 in the morning. She was hit on the head with an unknown object then forced into a closet while the intruder ransacked the house and got away with $5,000 worth of jewels. She was treated for minor head wounds at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released the next day. Four years later, in 1985, the house was destroyed in a fire. She expressed upset at losing personal keepsakes, including love letters from Robert Taylor.\n\nIn his autobiography, Cecil B. DeMille wrote that, among the actresses he directed, Barbara Stanwyck was his favorite. He said, \"Barbara's name is the first that comes to mind, as one on whom a director can always count to do her work with all her heart\".\n\nHer stormy, seven-year marriage to Frank Fay finally ended after a drunken brawl, during which he tossed their adopted son, Dion, into the swimming pool. Their divorce was finalized on December 30, 1935. The couple had adopted Dion on December 5, 1932. Dion (born John Charles Greene, February 5, 1932, Los Angeles County, California - died May 17, 2006, Van Nuys, Los Angeles County, California) became permanently estranged from Stanwyck in February 1951, when he was 19 years old; the rift never healed.\n\nIn 1957, Dion was arrested for trying to sell lewd pictures while waiting to cash his unemployment check. When questioned by the press about his famous mother, he replied, \"We don't speak.\" He and Stanwyck only saw each other a few times after their falling out. He was reportedly bequeathed some money from Stanwyck's estate on condition he never speak publicly about her.\n\nShe starred in Cecil B. DeMille's Union Pacific (1939) and received the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1986. Her acceptance speech: \"Thank you very, very much. To my beloved television brother, Charlton Heston [in Die Colbys - Das Imperium (1985)]. As Moses he parted the Red Sea for Mr. DeMille, and I helped Mr. DeMille build the Union Pacific Railroad. And we both loved him. I considered it a privilege to work for him. And to the Foreign Press Awards, I thank them for giving me another privilege: his very own award. I thank the Foreign Press, I thank Mr. DeMille, and I thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you\".\n\nIn a first-season episode of Big Valley (1965) (called \"Tunnel of Gold\"), Stanwyck's character, Victoria Barkley, explained that she lost both of her parents as a young child and was raised in a foster home. Years later, Stanwyck explained it was written that way because the exact same thing had happened to her as a child.\n\nShe drew praise in 1984 when, during her Golden Globes acceptance speech for \"The Thorn Birds,\" she spent much of her own limited time praising Ann-Margret for her performance in \"Who Will Love My Children?\", which was in a completely different category. It was noted in the press that this was typical of her, given Stanwyck's reputation for complimenting other actors during her own productions.\n\nIn Hollywood, as everywhere he went, Frank Fay did not make a lot of friends. A standard joke of the time went \"Who's got the biggest prick in Hollywood?\" Answer: \"Barbara Stanwyck.\" The womanizing, alcoholic Fay's career floundered, while Stanwyck's flourished for decades. In 1935, the two were divorced, and Fay continued his downward spiral until 1944, when he was chosen to play Elwood P. Dowd in the original New York City Broadway production of \"Harvey\".\n\nStanwyck vehemently opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to do the same without government intervention or assistance.\n\nCecil B. DeMille cast Stanwyck as Mollie Monahan in Union Pacific (1939) after offering the role to Claudette Colbert and Vivien Leigh. Colbert did not want to work with DeMille again as their temperaments had clashed while making their previous movies. Leigh purposefully asked DeMille for a higher salary because she wanted to play Scarlett O'Hara instead. He then gave the part to Stanwyck and was immediately impressed with her great talent and professionalism. She holds the distinction of being DeMille's all-time favorite actress. The movie also won the first Palme d'Or award, one of the most prestigious accolades in the film industry."
