        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Ketti Frings\n\nStory: Marty Holland\n\nDirector: Robert Siodmak\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, Wendell Corey, Paul Kelly, Joan Tetzel, Gertrude W. Hoffmann\n\nCinematography: George Barnes\n\nMusic: Victor Young\n\nStudio: Paramount Pictures\n\nRelease: January 5, 1950\n\nThough there is still one more film for me to tackle on this Robert Siodmak mini-Odyssey, “The File on Thelma Jordan” feels like the end of an era for the master filmmaker. No one else could make twisted, claustrophobic noir films like Siodmak, and this film represents his final exploration of that niche. After this, he would make one more straight noir with the much different, Italian-set “Deported” before turning his full attention to directing foreign films. Some were very good, many were dark, but none quite captured the mood of the noir films Siodmak made from 1944-1950.\n\nIf that weren’t enough, the film also showcases noir queen herself Barbara Stanwyck finally (finally!) uniting with Siodmak in the shadows. And boy-oh-boy does she get a humdinger of a role – still identifiably a femme fatale, but seen from a different, fresh angle.\n\nStanwyck plays the titular character, who one night steps into the office of ADA Cleve Marshall (Wendell Corey) to report an attempted robbery at the house of the elderly aunt (Gertrude W. Hoffmann) she lives with. But Cleve is near-blackout drunk – it’s his anniversary and his wife Pamela (Joan Tetzel) has invited her father to the dinner, which apparently is reason enough for Cleve to immediately initiate an affair with Thelma. Soon they seem to be in love, and one night Thelma calls Cleve because her aunt has been shot to death. Cleve hurries over and helps Thelma stage the scene, but after finding out she’s just inherited all her aunt’s money, the police still arrest her for the murder. So Cleve begins manipulating things behind the scenes and is soon the prosecuting attorney on the case, walking a tightrope to make it seem like he’s intent to get a guilty verdict while secretly working to free her.\n\nThough Thelma’s ex-boyfriend Tony (Richard Rober) is brought up several times as a red herring, it’s pretty clear that Thelma murdered her aunt, though the audience does not see the murder and she keeps feigning her innocence. Her behavior directly after the murder seems really fucking guilty, and every time Cleve asks her a simply logical question, Thelma says something along the lines of “We don’t have time right now!” or “We shouldn’t be arguing like this!” instead of answering. And yet the ultimate reveal of what went down, though predictable, still feels fresh thanks to the way Thelma explains it, and the moment triggers a Russian nesting doll of plot reveals, all of which happen at a delightful breakneck speed over the final fifteen minutes.\n\nThe third act was especially pleasing to me because I was very annoyed by the Cleve/Thelma seduction scene that opens the movie. Cleve is drunk, belligerent and quite nasty – and yet Thelma seems super horny for his drooling self. I watched, my jaw on the floor at how unrealistic the sequence came off. But I should have had more faith in screenwriter (and Pulitzer Prize winner) Ketti Frings (“Guest in the House”), who was working from a story by one of the queens of pulp writing Marty Holland. Frings was keeping her cards close to her chest as to why Thelma was behaving the way she was early, but instead of allowing the character to be a token evil monster, Frings takes pains to humanize her and her motives as Cleve keeps sticking his neck out for her. Could she really have feelings for him?\n\nLess successful is the subplot with Cleve’s wife Pamela. She functions entirely as a plot device, and comes across as so desperate in her appearances that you almost lose your ability to pity her. As the movie fades to black and Cleve welcomes disbarment for his actions, the screenplay still makes a point of saying that Pamela will still probably take Cleve back even after he was an accessory to murder because of the woman he was having an affair with. All that did was leave me with a sour taste in my mouth after the film ended.\n\nStanwyck is amazing. Because of course she is. Corey seems like an odd choice as the clueless ADA, and plays the role almost robotic in places. It weirdly works, though he has no chemistry with Stanwyck. Still, considering Stanwyck’s motives, maybe it’s better that they don’t? The rest of the ensemble offer up excellent supporting work – even Tetzel manages to make Pamela a little interesting despite the script sabotaging her in almost every scene.\n\nSiodmak was working here with cinematographer George Barnes (“Ladies in Retirement”), and I wish they had collaborated more often. Without making any of the camerawork overly showy, which would have been a mistake considering the content, they still bring the world to life… particularly in the sequences surrounding the murder in the aunt’s house. The explosive car wreck finale is also beautifully rendered and feels fresh despite there being dozens of variations on this scene in noir. It may be the best car accident of its type next to the climax of “Angel Face.”\n\n“The File on Thelma Jordan” is a sweet swan song for Siodmak’s classic noir period. Though it’s not on the level of “Criss Cross” or “The Killers” or “The Spiral Staircase,” not many films are. It’s still a very good movie with a fiery, exciting performance from Stanwyck which alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Roy Huggins\n\nStory: Lewis Meltzer and Oscar Saul\n\nDirector: Michael Gordon\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, Stephen McNally, Robert Preston\n\nCinematography: Russell Metty\n\nMusic: Frank Skinner\n\nStudio: Universal\n\nRelease: May 20, 1949\n\nOne suspects that Queen of Noir Barbara Stanwyck thought that “The Lady Gambles” was a sure thing when she joined the production. The film came out just a few years after Ray Milland won an Oscar and Susan Hayward was nominated for an Oscar for playing alcoholics in noir classics “The Lost Weekend” and “Smash Up: The Story of a Woman,” respectively. This film is very much in that same vein, and Stanwyck was coming off of an Oscar nomination for “Sorry, Wrong Number.” Dare I say, she was hoping… maybe even expecting… to net another nomination out of this?\n\nBut here’s the problem.\n\n“The Lady Gambles” stinks.\n\nIt’s a movie about an addiction to gambling that fundamentally does not understand addiction or gambling… which seems like it should be a pre-requisite.\n\nQueen Stanwyck plays Joan, a happily married reporter who accompanies her husband David (Robert Preston) on his business trip to Las Vegas. She’s caught taking some photographs on the casino floor by owner/oily motherfucker Horace Corrigan (Stephen McNally), who has the kind of name where you just have to write down both the first and last. He serves as the devil on Joan’s shoulders as she becomes addicted to gambling – things escalate about as you would expect, culminating in her being beaten bloody in a disgusting alley after she uses weighted dice.\n\nThat scene, which is used as the opening to the film before we flash back, is by far the best the movie has to offer. Seeing Joan brutalized in the dark alley is incredibly impactful, and hints that the film is a lot ballsier than it actually is. But immediately after, we cut to David, who is now estranged from Joan, launching into her story – and the flashbacks – with a rando doctor at the hospital while they wait for Joan to regain consciousness.\n\nThe movie is shot on location in Las Vegas and the filmmakers had ample access to several casinos, but you’d never guess that because of how they portray gambling itself. Writer Roy Huggins (“Pushover”) and director Michael Gordon (“The Web”) seemingly have no interest in showing why Joan became addicted in the first place. There’s no allure. Hell, most of the time we’re barely even told how the games are played. The tables don’t get any sort of visual distinction or tricks when shown… it has all the visual interest of a “Dragnet” episode, honestly. Joan is fine one minute, and the next she is taking out loans and begging people for fifty dollars. That’s not an exaggeration.\n\nWhich leads me to the other fundamental problem of the film – it also doesn’t care about Joan. She’s introduced as a feisty, fun, independent woman with her own career and onus. But the screenplay has no interest in Joan’s identity as a reporter or how that matters to her person. After about seven minutes of screen time, she is only defined one of two ways – by her gambling and by her marriage. That’s it. Sure, Huggins gives her speeches and has her character do “stuff,” but none of it gives us insight into her as a human being. And if we don’t understand what she’s losing by taking up gambling, the tragedy doesn’t land.\n\nWorse still is the ham-fisted ten-cent psycho-analyst bullshit reasoning they give us for Joan’s inner reasons to be attracted to gambling, most of which involve her co-dependent relationship with her terrible sister Ruth (Edith Barrett). It’s so heavy-handed it’s almost humorous.\n\nThis is the type of performance where the critics would label Stanwyck as “brave.” But that doesn’t mean she’s good. Any actress can portray someone beaten bloody in an alley – but good on Stanwyck for not having any vanity about the dark stuff. That said, nothing in her work here engages the viewer or makes them think they’re seeing anything other than Stanwyck prepping for her Oscar speech in her mind. It’s probably the weakest performance I’ve ever seen from her.\n\nThen again, no one here really seems to give much of a fuck about the movie. Preston and McNally are both wooden, and neither shares an ounce of chemistry with Stanwyck. Barrett is so over-the-top that she seems to be in an entirely different film than the rest of the ensemble.\n\nHuggins’ screenplay offers nary a single memorable line of dialogue, nor any real insight into addiction aside from surface level platitudes that make you roll your eyes. Gordon is, all things considered, a very decent director when he seems inspired by the material… but he’s not inspired at all here. His cinematographer is Russell Metty, who created some of the most memorable noir imagery of all time in films like “The Stranger” and “Whistle Stop.” Here he has some fun making the exteriors in Vegas look like a gaudy delight, but is otherwise content with medium shots and workmanlike set-ups.\n\nThe film ends with Joan attempting to kill herself by climbing out her hospital window and throwing herself off the ledge. She is saved by David, who thinks (along with the film itself) that, now that she’s gotten that silliness out of her system, she’s going to be okay. It’s a bullshit ending, made even more cringe inducing when, three minutes after she attempted to kill herself at that window, David drags her back over there to force her to watch the sunrise with him. While he enjoys the view, she remembers her trauma from only a few moments prior… all while composer Frank Skinner’s score goes to all lengths to make us feel like this is a redemptive moment. Pardon me while I go vomit.\n\nScore: *\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Chester Erskine\n\nDirector: Roy Rowland\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, George Sanders, Gary Merrill\n\nCinematography: John Alton\n\nMusic: Herschel Burke Gilbert\n\nStudio: United Artists\n\nRelease: April 15, 1954\n\n“Witness to Murder” is an entirely functional film that has understandably fallen through the cracks of time because everything notable about the movie has been done better elsewhere. It exists, I guess, but how often will one think of it?\n\nBarbara Stanwyck stars as Cheryl, the titular witness to a murder across the street from her apartment. Late one night, she sees popular author Albert (George Sanders) strangle a woman to death in his own apartment, but he manages to hide the body before the police arrive to search. The cops tell Cheryl it was just a bad dream, but Albert nonetheless starts gaslighting Cheryl… if she seems like a crazy stalker, then no one will believe he is capable of murder. Of course, no one believes her pleas, and soon she ends up committed… but when she gets out, Albert decides it would be best to simply kill Cheryl and make everyone think it was suicide.\n\nI have no way of knowing whether writer/producer Chester Erskine (“Split Second”) knew that Alfred Hitchcock was concurrently directing his masterpiece “Rear Window” while “Witness to Murder” was being made, but I think it’s not a stretch to say that the premises of the two films are quite similar. This one was released first by a few months, but the much-superior “Rear Window” is the one everyone remembers, and rightfully so. I won’t get into the other aspects of the production which are close to other noir films, because they are obvious and myriad… and it’s going to get long-winded to just keep focusing on this.\n\nInstead, let’s discuss the two parts of “Witness to Murder” which make it distinctive. The first is the dismissiveness with which every male character approaches Cheryl’s accusations. It was just a dream. You’re imagining things. You’re actually the crazy one. You’re stalking him. You may hurt him. You’re suicidal. This aspect of the production has aged quite well, but the unfortunate part is that the filmmakers don’t actually seem to care about the statements they are making here. After all, Cheryl is basically an afterthought in the finale to her own movie, knocked off a roof while her love interest defeats Albert and then rescues her from falling a dozen stories to her death. Wait, there’s a love interest? Put a pin in that thought – I’ll get to him momentarily.\n\nBut first, the second distinctive part of the movie is legendary cinematographer John Alton (“The Big Combo”) doing some grand work. The apartments ooze atmosphere, but the most distinctive sequence is the one where Cheryl is committed. Alton appears to just place a large spotlight on the characters in their room, and uses their shadows brilliantly to underline how trapped they feel.\n\nEverything else, though? Meh.\n\nStanwyck is miscast in the main role. She’s too strong a presence for her character… someone like Joan Fontaine would have been better as Cheryl. That said, I’d actually love to see a gaslighting movie with Stanwyck as the lead and have her attempt to keep her strength as the world falls apart around her – but that ain’t this film. And I don’t buy her falling apart so quickly, fully and repeatedly. Sanders is ideally cast as the villain, but the what-the-actual-fuck twist of turning Albert into a straight-up Nazi is baffling.\n\nAnd then there’s Gary Merrill as the aforementioned love interest, a police detective named Lawrence. He pursues Cheryl even though, in every scene they share until the finale, he at some point says that she’s crazy or lying or misunderstanding or whatever. The characterization is “yikes!” to say the least, and in a later scene Lawrence mentions that he wishes he could believe Cheryl and tried working it out in his head for so long… a sentiment that is sweet but directly contradicted by every prior scene in the movie. He’s a terrible hero, I don’t root for the romance and am pretty disgusted that he gets the big hero moment at the end.\n\nThe director is Roy Rowland (something called “Rogue Cop”), and he seems perfectly fine doing the least amount of work possible with the cast. The actors don’t seem sharpened and honed… they’re just there. Well, at least he got out of Alton’s way and let him create a great nightmarish atmosphere.\n\nIf you haven’t seen “Witness to Murder” yet and have made it this far in the review, I think you know that it’s not necessary viewing. If you have, then you probably don’t mind me admitting that I don’t have anything else to say about this minor entry in the genre and ending the article early.\n\nScore: *1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Thomas Job\n\nBased on the play by Martin Vale\n\nDirector: Peter Godfrey\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Ann Carter, Nigel Bruce\n\nCinematography: J. Peverell Marley\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 4, 1947\n\n“The Two Mrs. Carrolls” is unusual in how terrible it is.\n\nUsually when I don’t like a movie, I can pinpoint a few parts of the production which caused the awfulness. But this is one of… perhaps the only?… time during this entire Odyssey when I have seen so many otherwise-competent filmmakers collectively shit the bed.\n\nThe plot concerns a tortured artist named Geoffrey (Humphrey Bogart) who, while vacationing in Scotland, falls head over heels for Sally (Barbara Stanwyck). The only problem is that he’s already got a wife and daughter Beatrice (Ann Carter) at home. So he buys poison from a local chemist (Barry Bernard) under an assumed named and kills his wife by administering the poison in her milk. Then he marries Sally, moves into her idyllic English country estate… and begins lusting after family-friend-twice-removed Cecily (Alexis Smith). And thus the cycle begins again. But will Sally figure it out in time to stop another murder from taking place… her own?\n\nIf you are reading that and thinking that it sounds eerily similar to noir films “Gaslight” and “Suspicion,” you would be correct. This is a blatant rip-off, but without the technical prowess of “Suspicion” or the emotional trauma of “Gaslight.” There’s even a motherfucking glass of poisoned milk delivered by the husband! I’m surprised it wasn’t glowing.\n\nScreenwriter Thomas Job (“Escape in the Desert”) assumes the viewer is a fool and that he has to repeat every pertinent bit of information to the plot at least three times in order for us to pick up on things. This includes small stuff, like when Geoffrey buys the poison from the chemist and uses a fake name. The Chemist repeats the fake name “Fleming” three times, each more intensely than the last… and the third is after Geoffrey leaves as he repeats the name while stroking his chin, suspicious of the name for literally no understandable reason except to make sure the audience understands that this story development will come back later.\n\nThen there are the big things, like the explanation of what Geoffrey is doing. It’s not enough that we see what he’s up to. No, we need recaps every few minutes during the second half. First Sally has a ten-minute conversation (not hyperbole) with Beatrice where the little girl handily explains everything her father was doing to his first wife and how that is being repeated now while Sally cringes in terror. But then, a few moments later, we get a scene where Sally is alone in her bedroom, haunted by voiceover of what we just heard while cringing and connecting the dots for us. But then, at the climax, Geoffrey stops just short of killing Sally and instead re-explains for four minutes (again, not hyperbole) what he is doing and why he is doing it.\n\nPlay a drinking game if you watch the film – every time information is repeated three times in dialogue, take a shot. You’ll be blacked out by the end of the third reel.\n\nThat said, to be clear, you shouldn’t watch the film.\n\nBogart and Stanwyck are grossly miscast in the lead roles, both hamming it up to a shocking extent, complete with hair-pulling, grabbing their foreheads as they struggle with something mentally and screaming for no apparent reason. It’s kind of baffling how they were both roped into such a stinker and honestly look embarrassed in certain scenes. There’s a coda where the filmmakers turn the entire proceedings into a joke (because of course they do) where Geoffrey asks the police arresting him if they want some milk, and you can all but see Bogart cringing onscreen trying to deliver the line. Smith is given nothing to do but slink around with obvious mustache twirling… why was she even cast in such a throwaway role? Carter is unfortunate playing the unfortunate clam of the little who speaks like an adult, and Nigel Bruce is also on hand to do a mustachioed version of his bumbling Doctor Watson… obviously cast because he was also in “Suspicion.”\n\nThe director is Peter Godfrey, who made the almost-good “Cry Wolf” and the almost-terrible “Woman in White.” Was he napping for the entire shoot? Or was he the guy encouraging Bogart and Stanwyck to overact? Whatever the case – how dare you, sir! His cinematographer is J. Peverell Marley, who is a good cinematographer elsewhere in movies like “Whiplash” and “Hound of the Baskervilles.” But here? Even a thunderstorm looks boring under his lens. In the entire (much too long) 100 minute running time, there is only one memorable shot – when Geoffrey breaks through the window into Sally’s room at the climax, but even that is undercut by having Geoffrey immediately start to monologue after.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the set-design is also terrible. Sally is supposed to be well off, not rich (as underlined three times in the screenplay), but we get essentially a castle for her and Geoffrey to live in… way overdesigned to the point where it’s funny. You can tell great care was taken at crafting it – all for naught. Hell, it doesn’t even shoot well, so maybe it wasn’t all Marley’s fault.\n\nDear reader, there were many, many moments where I considered turning off “The Two Mrs. Carrolls” because of its ineptitude. The only reason I made it through is to write this article. But you? You don’t have to put up with this torture. Run far, run fast… just run.\n\nScore: ½*\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Frank Fenton\n\nStory: John Dickson Carr\n\nDirector: Fletcher Markle\n\nCast: Joseph Cotton, Leslie Caron, Barbara Stanwyck\n\nCinematography: George J. Folsey\n\nMusic: David Raksin\n\nStudio: MGM\n\nRelease: November 27, 1951\n\n“The Man With a Cloak” is a pretty decent movie that doesn’t know when to get out of its own way. Though there’s only one credited writer, the screenplay feels like it was written and rewritten by a dozen screenwriters, all interested in different aspects of the story and dealing with odd, confusing studio notes.\n\nOur main character is the mysterious Dupin (Joseph Cotton), a penniless drunk who enters town using a pseudonym. He meets Madeline (Leslie Caron), who has come from France to attempt to get her fiancé’s grandfather Charles (Louis Calhern) to donate money to the revolution in France. Charles has a live-in sort-of girlfriend Lorna (queen of noir Barbara Stanwyck) and two servants who will currently be willed all of Charles’ money, and they have no intention of giving it up without a fight and… maybe… murder. Dupin intervenes on Madeline’s behalf, trying to get Charles to do the right thing even though he finds himself drawn to Lorna in all the ways straight men are drawn to Stanwyck in these types of movies.\n\nIf you’re a little confused, that’s okay. The plotline is confusing, convoluted and unsure thematically of what it wants to say. Madeline seems like she should be the main character because she’s the one with the goal and she’s the one living in the big old house with all those servants who hate her and are actively plotting against her. And yet Dupin needlessly keeps being inserted as the lead because… uh… he’s a man? Charles dies at a really odd point in the narrative, and the plot after that hinges on a missing will that a bird stole out of the dying man’s hands. Yes, you read that last sentence correctly.\n\nAnd then there’s this whole business about Dupin himself. A title card at the beginning tells the viewer: “This is the tale of a wanderer, once little known and less respected, whose real name later became immortal.” Okay, deducing who he is could be fun… until he introduces himself as Dupin and anyone who has read “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is like “Uh, Edgar Alan Poe.” And for those that didn’t read that story, it becomes pretty fucking clear when the pet raven shows up. But then the rest of his personality and surroundings don’t really connect with any of Poe’s stories (aside from him being a drunk)… so why didn’t screenwriter Frank Fenton (“His Kind of Woman”) go all the way with Easter eggs? Either that or just not let the audience know that Poe was Poe until the end and make it a real reveal that seems awesome in retrospect.\n\nBut also… why is Poe even using a pseudonym? He’s not running from the cops and has no reason to change his name, since no one at the time gave a shit about him. It’s a blatant screenwriting trick not born out of character or storytelling and simply done to fool us. And how annoying is that?\n\nThat said, there’s this weird power to certain aspects of the movie. Parts that would be routine in 99% of other films are fascinating, weird or highly original. Lupin’s conversations with a local bartender (Thurston Howell III) crackle with great dialogue. And the way Fenton turns Stanwyck’s Lorna into an engaging villain who remains very human and broken all the way to the end is awesome. The plot is also smarter than it has to be in places – Lorna and the servants aren’t poisoning Charles… they are replacing his medication with sugar water instead and just waiting for him to die.\n\nIt also helps that the cast is this stacked. And that everyone in this stacked cast is performing at the peaks of their powers. Cotton is charming as hell as Lupin and shares bananas good chemistry with Stanwyck, who is so magnetic that she commands every moment she’s onscreen. Caron is very good with the little that is asked of her – again, this is a shame because she should have been the lead – and Calhern makes the most of a one-note role.\n\nIt didn’t strike me until after the film ended that it must have been fairly low budget. Even though it’s period, it only has three major sets: the house, the bar and the street between the two. But director Fletcher Markle (“Jigsaw”) and cinematographer George Folsey make the world of the film big… almost overwhelming at times. Folsey in particular does good work here – he later lensed a film called “The Cobweb,” which I won’t be covering on the Noir Odyssey but is one of the craziest movies of all time: in it, the choice of wallpaper in an insane asylum leads to murder. Not kidding.\n\nIf I were being really honest with myself, I would have to say that “The Man With a Cloak” is not a good film. It fundamentally makes so many storytelling problems that it does not function as a narrative, and I hate the tricks it plays on the audience. But, like a weird dream that lingers with you into the hours of the afternoon, it has an odd power over the viewer. I’m not recommending the movie, but I’m not not recommending the movie either.\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Catherine Turney\n\nBased on the novel by Marjorie Carleton\n\nDirector: Peter Godfrey\n\nCast: Errol Flynn, Barbara Stanwyck, Geraldine Brooks\n\nCinematography: Carl E.

The unlucky thing is that the 5% is the final moments, so it leaves a terrible taste in the viewer’s mouth when he looks back at the entire thing. What a damn shame, because for awhile there, I was pretty sure I was watching a lost treasure.\n\nQueen of film noir Barbara Stanwyck stars as Sandra, a gutsy woman who stomps her way into the family home of Mark (Errol Flynn) and says that she is the wife of his just-deceased brother Jim. She hides nothing – Jim told her that he needed to be married to inherit and she needed her college paid for, so they entered the marriage almost as strangers and planned to divorce quietly six months later after the money came through. But then Jim died. Sandra offers up a copy of a will and just wants her part. Mark is immediately venomous toward her, forcing her to threaten to take the entire estate unless they find the original will.\n\nSoon enough Sandra is staying at the house while the search is mounted. She meets Jim’s spirited sister Julie (Geraldine Brooks), who begs for her help. Mark is controlling her entire life and did the same for Jim before he died, Julie says. And he keeps holing himself up in a locked-off wing all night. Sandra doesn’t know what to make of it… but then begins to hear screams echoing from the closed-off wing…\n\nI’m a sucker for this kind of noir… where it’s meshed together with old dark houses and vaguely romantic melodrama. Daphne du Marier didn’t write the novel upon which “Cry Wolf” was based, but she might as well have. What truly elevates this from most other entries in this sub-genre is Sandra (and Stanwyck’s performance). Girl is take-no-prisoners in the best way possible. “I am not a placid girl,” she says early in a great line of dialogue, and damn if she isn’t right. She uses a dumbwaiter to get into the hidden wing and, later, crawls across the roof to gain entry through a skylight. She slaps a motherfucker when he crosses a line. And she is blunt instead of hiding how she’s feeling. I genuinely loved her and was rooting for her hard to uncover the secret.\n\nFurther, screenwriter Catherine Turney (“No Man of Her Own”) does a brilliant job of setting all the chess pieces in the right places. Up until those terrible last five minutes, when the truth becomes clear as to what is going on, I was mystified as to what was going on. Turney is excellent at leaning into Mark’s ambiguity without pushing him too far into villainy, and note how she places emphasis on visuals to underline or contrast what we are hearing in the dialogue.\n\nAnd then that ending fucks it all up.\n\nTurns out Jim is alive and crazy and murdered someone so Mark faked his death and has been keeping him essentially hostage on the grounds in order to… something. Keep things kosher? Julie was also crazy before she maybe committed suicide. And Mark is a hero and Sandra apologizes and says she never should have meddled or not trusted him even though literally everything he did was suspicious and all those screams in the night and… UGH. I hate it. So much.\n\nThe twist certainly hasn’t aged well in terms of shaming those who have mental illness and calling them too fargone to ever find love, marry or have children. In other words, it’s gross as hell. But it’s also, well, the cheapest possible way out of the tantalizing maze the rest of the film has gotten the viewer lost in. It’s basically telling you that there isn’t even a maze. And those few lines of dialogue undo all the fine character work we’ve seen from Sandra… turns out she was just a silly woman after all who should have never questioned the man in charge.\n\nPardon me while I vomit.\n\nStanwyck is superb. Because of course she is. The dialogue she’s given was already good, but she elevates it in every scene she is in. Flynn, who was of course one of the great assholes of his generation of actors, is also very good. He plays his possible villainy beautifully… is he a monster, or just on the spectrum? It helps that he and Stanwyck play very well off one another – it’s not sexual chemistry, but they make one another better every time their characters spar. The only other major character is Julie, and Brooks beautifully renders the character, especially when you look at her in retrospect after learning the aforementioned shitty twist. It’s a shame she never became a bigger star.\n\nDirector Peter Godfrey made the noir adaptation of “The Woman in White,” but this is in a different league than that half-baked thing. Here he has a good handle on his actors, and his collaboration with cinematographer Carl E. Guthrie (who also lensed “Woman in White”) is sublime. The house the characters inhabit is truly an astonishing visual achievement – in its best moments it can give Manderly or Norma Desmond’s home a run for its money. That includes the set design – note how in the closed-off wing literally everything possible is painted white, and how impactful that is in the wide shots.\n\nI have no idea how to recommend this film aside from to say that it’s great until it’s really, Really, REALLY not great at all. There are a myriad of things to recommend in it, but that ending comes close to undoing them all. I’m not unhappy I’ve seen it, but I’m never going to watch it again. So how about I toss two-and-a-half stars its way then throw up my hands and walk away?\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Lucille Fletcher\n\nBased on her radio play\n\nDirector: Anatole Litvak\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, Burt Lancaster, Ann Richards\n\nCinematography: Sol Polito\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Paramount Pictures\n\nRelease: September 1, 1948\n\nAwards: Stanwyck was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar but lost to Jane Wyman in “Johnny Belinda”\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\nThe ending of “Sorry, Wrong Number” is one of the most iconic in film history, so much so that even if you’ve never heard of the film, if I described the plot you probably could tell me what happens in the finale. Unlike films like “The Sixth Sense” or “The Usual Suspects,” whose ends rely on twists, “Sorry, Wrong Number” simply refuses to let the audience off the hook, painting a black-as-pitch ending which leaves the viewer stunned by its ballsiness.\n\nThat aspect of the film is why it’s one of the most famous in noir. But if we ignore the ending, I have to say that the entire package does not hold up as well as I wanted it to. In my eyes, there are several fundamental problems that the movie, for its many attributes, cannot overcome.\n\nBut first, the story… in case you were somehow unaware. Queen of noir Barbara Stanwyck plays the bedridden Leona Stevenson, making busybody calls to fill her evening until her husband Henry (Burt Lancaster) comes home. Thinking she’s hearing a crossed line, Leona overhears two men preparing to murder a woman in her home that night. Many, many phone calls later, Leona realizes that the person about to be murdered is her… and that her husband is behind it all.\n\nThe film is based on an incredibly popular radio play by Lucille Fletcher, who adapted it into a screenplay. The original play, which starred Agnes Moorehead, is only a half hour and is genuinely gripping and engaging all the way through. In expanding (and expanding (and expanding)) the storyline to feature length, Fletcher is not only throwing in a lot of hot air, but accidentally placing a spotlight on coincidences and plot holes. They worked in the short drama because the script was already moving on to the next thing, but not here.\n\nFurther, the radio play works because it is intentionally claustrophobic. We can feel the walls closing in around Leona. In the film, director Anatole Litvak (“The Long Night”) goes to extreme pains to open up the world. The camera swoops all through Leona’s house. Leona’s calls always go through to crowded, expansive rooms. Flashbacks expand the world further. It seems to me that, in jumping through all these hoops to legitimize turning the radio play into a film, the filmmakers had completely lost track of why the play worked in the first place. Oops.\n\nAnd then there’s Stanwyck’s casting as Leona. As previously established in most of my articles on this Web site, I love Stanwyck. But here I think she’s gravely miscast. Not because she can’t play a horrible person, because she obviously can… and do it well. She’s miscast because I don’t for a moment buy her as an invalid. And yes, there a vagueness to how sick Leona actually is, but Stanwyck conveys this inner strength in all her characters that comes through here… when it shouldn’t. It feels like she is putting on a show instead of actually inhabiting Leona, and her increasing paranoia as the movie continues equates to her going further and further over the top. It’s a real shame. Then again, Stanwyck was nominated for an Oscar for her performance here, so I assume I’m in the minority.\n\nThe final fundamental problem I have here is the story’s predictability. The film is 89 minutes (it feels longer) and by minute 3 any viewer of moderate intelligence will be able to figure out that Leona’s husband Henry is behind everything. Plus, there’s the poster. And then we wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for the reveal. To her credit, Fletcher tries to throw in some red herrings and also hints at a larger conspiracy at play… but none of these are engaging enough to keep us from focusing on Henry’s guilt. Plus, he’s played by Burt Freaking Lancaster, so you know he didn’t show up for a nothing role… even if, ultimately, the performance and character still come across as thankless.\n\nFor all these problems, and they are myriad, I didn’t hate “Sorry, Wrong Number.” Honestly. There are a lot of small things that the film gets exactly right, especially in the character details, that makes me appreciate both Fletcher and the ensemble’s talent. And though I think Litvak took the wrong approach for this adaptation, I must admit that the location work and the atmosphere of the apartment look great, thanks in no small part to his collaboration with cinematographer Sol Polito (“The Long Night”).\n\nAnd then there’s the fact that the film fills a bunch of walk-on and small roles with African American actors, including the cutest little girl ever as a lost child in a police station. As sad as it is to admit it, I’d gotten completely used to seeing these all-white films noir… and it was such a pleasant surprise to see diversity here, even if they are background characters.\n\nI think that, at some point, every noir enthusiast finds his or her way to “Sorry, Wrong Number.” And, dear reader, I genuinely hope that you end up liking it much better than I do. That finale still packs a punch… but the rest of the movie leading up to it is a swing and a miss. Did I just mix metaphors? I don’t know sports…\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey/The AFI Top 100 Odyssey\n\nAFI Top 100 Ranking: 29\n\nWriter: Billy Wilder & Raymond Chandler\n\nBased on the novel by James M. Cain\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nCast: Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson\n\nCinematography: John Seitz\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nStudio: Paramount\n\nRelease: July 3, 1944\n\nPercent Noir: 100%\n\nThe dame. The dialogue. The gun. The descent. The Venetian blinds.\n\nIf I had to choose one movie that defines the film noir genre, it would be “Double Indemnity.” The film breathes bleakness. It has the best femme fatale (sorry, Kathleen Turner) ever to grace a staircase. The script is the most literate, quotable noir ever (sorry, Robert Towne) and the movie’s direction is beautiful in its shadows and specters.\n\nThis was Billy Wilder’s gift. Over his long career, he worked within almost every major film genre (even ones, like noir, which had yet to be defined as such) and in doing so brought those genres to their pinnacle. He completely understood his subject matter, and his work rarely judged, reinvented or deconstructed—instead he just polished the conventions until they gleamed. “Double Indemnity.” “Sabrina.” “Sunset Blvd.” “The Seven Year Itch.” “Witness for the Prosecution.” “The Apartment.” “Love in the Afternoon.” In fact, his few missteps were when he did deconstruct the genres he was working within, as with “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes” or “Fedora.”\n\nWilder wrote the screenplay with Raymond Chandler, whose Philip Marlowe novels are masterpieces of style over substance. I’m guessing Wilder brought the structure and morals (okay, lack of morals) to the table while Chandler focused on dialogue and characterization. All historians point out how much the duo hated one another but the result is just about perfect.\n\nThe story focuses on an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) named Walter Neff (“with two f’s, just like Philadelphia”). Neff seems like a normal Joe who knows how to light matches in a really, really cool way. The moment he sets eyes on Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) wrapped in a towel on top of a staircase, he’s doomed. There’s a lot of foreplay, the kind that makes you all sweaty without any physical contact, and soon Neff is Phyllis’ willing toy. She wants to murder her husband and collect his accident insurance, and Neff is more than willing to help. Complicating matters is Neff’s best (only?) friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), who is his boss at work but also his moral compass. Keyes smells something wrong with the murder, but just can’t put his finger on it, and Neff is right when he concludes that Keyes was just too close to the case.\n\nNeff and Phyllis circle each other beautifully as they wait for the perfect moment to finally be together. There’s no sex in the relationship—instead they make love to one another through beautifully constructed phrases and small gestures. They say they love each other, but you have to wonder if either of them really believes it. To me, they could care less about one another, but the idea of working together and getting away with being very, very bad people is the major turn on. They need one another in that way, and without the other all that is left is an empty shell. Look at a small moment in a grocery store, where Neff leaves and Wilder linger his camera on Phyllis for a few seconds at the end of the scene. While Neff was there her eyes were filled with fire and passion, but the moment he steps out of frame Phyllis’ eyes go completely dead. It’s unnerving.\n\nThough MacMurray is billed first in the credits, this is Stanwyck’s movie. MacMurray is very good in the role, but can afford to be a bit wooden (the role calls for this, so it’s not a shortcoming) because of the voice-over narration throughout. Stanwyck must use every line, every gesture, to get her allure and venomous nature across. She uses her beautifully curvy body as she approaches MacMurray after fixing him a drink. After three or four lines, it’s easy to understand exactly why Neff would break a man’s neck for her. She’s the ultimate femme fatale. Her later performance in Fritz Lang’s underrated noir masterpiece “Clash By Night” is a beautiful companion piece to “Double Indemnity.” In “Clash By Night,” she is a femme fatale desperately trying to go straight in a world filled with oily men trying to bring out her wicked side.\n\nKeyes is one of the best of all Noir foils because of his friendship with Neff. He never wavers and never questions Neff’s honesty—he simply believes his friend is a good person and nothing will sway that, even though the evidence keeps stacking up against Neff. What makes the role even juicier is that Keyes is such a swift, perfect judge of character. At one point Keyes overhears Neff’s half of a phone call between him and Phyllis. Neff chooses his words wisely so as not to incriminate himself and yet, as soon as he gets off the phone, Keyes already understands the caller’s character: “I bet she drinks from the bottle.” This is one of Robinson’s best performances in a career of “best performances,” and it’s because he has such a gift for showing humanity in the characters he plays even though his exterior seems to contradict this.\n\nThe three characters play their life-and-death game of chess in drawing rooms and offices overflowing with shadows, reflections and unease. The Italian-style home Phyllis lives in only seems beautiful upon first glance in the full sunlight. Once inside it seems imposing, almost sinister. And the dread-filled insurance office we see in the opening moments of the film still seems creepy during daylight hours because we know the blood trails will be there sooner rather than later.\n\nWilder shoots these locations in lingering, long takes. He doesn’t throw in too many close-ups, instead letting the dialogue flow through the rooms and scenes. He works hard to not show off too much, though he starts us off with a doozy of a long take that introduces us to a lobby, elevator and then a two-story office. Wilder knows that the stars here are not the spaces and atmosphere (though they add a lot), but the words and the people.\n\nIt would seem upon first glance that “Double Indemnity” is one of the bleakest films noir. The anti-heroes succeed in the murder they plotted. The “hero” is caught and will be hanged. The “heroine” is brutally shot by the “hero” after declaring her love for him. And yet it doesn’t feel depressing. The exchanges between MacMurray and Robinson in those final moments manage to redeem Neff’s character in a way seeing him die never could. Thanks for that, Edward G. Robinson. I love you too.\n\nScore: *****\n\nAwards: “Double Indemnity” was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to “Going My Way” (also nominated: “Gaslight”).

The title character is a nearly impossible needle to thread and, in any given scene, somehow be all things to all people. She’s an enigma, and yet you have to completely understand her. Within one scene she must be completely sympathetic, but also the harshest of femme fatales. It’s an almost-literal interpretation of the main character from W. Somerset Maugham’s masterpiece “Theater.” As the movie progressed and I watched Stanwyck perform this incredible tight rope walk, I began wondering if any other actress could have pulled this role off. I don’t think anyone could.\n\nOnce, years ago, Martha murdered her guardian/aunt (Judith Anderson, sinking her teeth into a thankless cameo) in cold blood. There was one witness for sure – the frightened, malleable Walter (Kirk Douglas as an adult), and another possible witness in their friend Sam (Van Heflin as an adult). Walter keeps Martha’s secret, but Sam disappears into a thunderstorm, never heard from again for decades. Then one day Sam reappears in the town and crashes his car, then bonds with a jailbird named Toni (Lizabeth Scott), who is arrested soon for probation. With Walter now the district attorney and Martha head of the biggest company in town, Sam decides to reintroduce himself into their lives and ask a favor.\n\nMartha and Walter are already white-knuckling it through marriage, and when Sam reappears they immediately assume he’s there to blackmail them about that night. We realize that not only did Martha lie, but then she blamed an innocent man who ultimately hung for the crime. Yikes. Things escalate quickly, with Marta using her seduction tactics on Sam and Walter hiring people to beat the fuck out of him… all the while Sam tries to figure out what is going on.\n\nIt’s a complicated story that embraces melodrama more often than other films noir, but that is not a bad thing. Walter in particular is a train wreck, saying things he shouldn’t while drunk, which is approximately every scene in the film. And Sam’s triangle with Toni and Martha engages as soon as you realize what the filmmakers are looking to explore with it – your heart breaks when it seems like Sam is about to abandon Toni, but another part of you is just so fascinated with Martha that you can’t wait to see what happens next. The screenplay by Robert Rossen takes time to develop three of the four leads into three dimensional characters. Walter is given the short end of the stick, but since he’s the wild card of the quartet that is probably a good sign. You can feel the history between Martha and Sam in almost every line of dialogue they speak to one another – watch how the characters relax, tense and the actors show so much emotion through a simple glance or a clearing of their throat.\n\nThere is another lower-budget version of this movie that takes place completely in sitting rooms, offices and the like – I’m actually surprised this has never been adapted for the stage before. But director Lewis Milestone (“All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Anything Goes”) is smart to open the film and world up. There’s a visual distinction to Iverstown missing from many other comparable films noir – it feels a touch more real. Like there are other lives happening around our four characters that will be affected by how things turn out for them. Milestone and his cinematographer Victor Milner (“Dark City,” “Jeopardy”) are attempting to create an entire world out of this town, one as distinctive in its own way as Mandalay in “Rebecca” or the town in “Clash By Night.” Perhaps the one place the movie shoots itself in the foot from a crew standpoint is Miklos Rozsa’s score – the guy is a master composer, but this is an exception, with the music way too insistent. Throughout, it telegraphs emotions instead of underlining them.\n\nI’ve already mentioned Stanwyck, but it bears repeating – she is fabulous here. That said, I must admit that her costumes were not the best… this is perhaps the one misstep I’ve ever seen from costume design icon Edith Head. Heflin is fine as her maybe-lost love, having insane chemistry with Stanwyck and okay chemistry with Scott. Scott is otherwise enjoyable as the good girl with the dark past. Douglas seems miscast at first as such a passive character (this was his first major role in a film), but he acquits himself very well to the proceedings, nailing his more complex stuff in the last act of the movie.\n\nNow “The Strange Love of Martha Ivers” is a noir touchstone, which is odd considering it’s not very hardboiled but is very deliberately paced (at two hours, it feels long but not overlong). The reason this happened is obvious – Paramount let the copyright on the film lapse decades ago. In a way, that’s the best thing that could have happened to the movie… everyone who starts exploring the world of noir buys one of those six-film sets for eight bucks that includes “Detour,” “Scarlet Street,” “The Stranger,” “DOA,” “The Red House” and, you guessed it, this flick. When you think about it, those six flicks are a great intro to noir, even if they aren’t all masterpieces, but that’s another story. The movie would have probably fallen through the cracks of time otherwise, especially considering it’s more melodrama than noir.\n\nAnd that’s a great thing, because the movie is a small treasure for noir fans. Stanwyck would give iconic performances elsewhere in noir (and comedy, with her masterpiece “Christmas in Connecticut”), but this may be her most layered, successful one ever. She makes this movie unmissable.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Mel Dinelli\n\nBased on: “A Question of Time” radio play by Maurice Zimm\n\nDirector: John Sturges\n\nCinematographer: Victor Milner\n\nMusic: Dimitri Tiomkin\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, Ralph Meeker, Barry Sullivan, Lee Aaker\n\nRelease: March 30, 1953\n\nStudio: MGM\n\nPercent Noir: 50%\n\nBarbara Stanwyck is the queen of film noir, but we all know that she was in as many stinkers as she was masterpieces. And that’s okay – even in her worst films, Stanwyck was still awesome, and it made you appreciate her professionalism. So when I viewed the opening credits of this little-seen, little-discussed one-hour-and-ten-minute noir and they were in the font of a bad ‘50s monster movie, I didn’t hold out much hope. Boy was I wrong.\n\nSure, it starts pretty badly. Stanwyck’s character Helen is given some bland (bland!) filler voiceover to pad the running time, going on about travelling and Tijuana in a film that has little to do with the former and nothing to do with the latter. But as the actual story is set into motion, things get interesting. Helen, her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and their young son Bobby (Lee Aaker) are vacationing in a remote part of Mexico. They set up next to an abandoned, falling-apart jetty, and thanks to an accident Doug gets his leg stuck under a pole of wood. He’s fine, but trapped, and no one panics… until they realize the tide is coming in and will drown Doug within four hours unless they get him free. Uh oh. Helen races to get help and rope to move the wood, but it’s at least an hour’s drive to anywhere with human beings.\n\nIn other words, things suck. They get worse when Helen accidentally picks up an escaped murderer named Lawson (Ralph Meeker) and is suddenly thrust into a battle of wills with him. He wants to get out of the area before the police find him, she just wants to get back to help her husband. And all through this, the tide continues to come in…\n\nOnce the story gets moving, it’s a doozy. Better than that, no one acts stupid. Helen tries to use the car’s jack to get the wood off her husband (why did it feel dirty typing that?). She tries to get away every chance she can once Lawson shows his true colors, and physically fights him often so she can escape (one fight in particular seems so real I’m surprised Meeker didn’t come away with scratches on his face). Though at first Helen seems no more than a cardboard wife character, the more desperate she gets, the more interesting she becomes.\n\nAnd once Lawson enters the picture, it’s impossible to look away. I am not familiar with much of Meeker’s work aside from “Kiss Me Deadly,” but damn the dude is talented. He has firecracker chemistry with Stanwyck, and though he is a vile, despicable guy, Meeker makes you like his swagger and personality from the moment he starts eating Helen’s crackers (not a metaphor). I almost wonder if they rewrote the ending of the film to give Meeker some redemption and the possibility of escape once they realized that the audience would immediately fall for him.\n\nMeeker and Stanwyck take part in a very interesting scene at an abandoned house. An increasingly desperate Helen knows her husband only has a few minutes left, so she tries her hand at seducing Lawson. And since it’s Barbara Stanwyck, she does a damn good job at it. You really believe her when she makes sex eyes at Lawson and says “I’ll do anything to save my husband.” Lawson says that, if he helps Doug, Helen will have to go away with him and pretend to be his wife so that, when they are stopped at roadblocks, the police believe them. Helen agrees, and then the duo begin to make out. They kiss, trade insults, then kiss again. Lawson says that he doesn’t like this, kisses her once more, and they cut away. Does Helen have sex with Lawson? Probably. I’m legitimately shocked that they allowed this content in a film in 1953 but hey, good for them. I love moral ambiguity.\n\nAlso outstanding is the finale, where Lawson redeems himself by rescuing Doug in a nailbiting sequence (Sullivan seems legitimately trapped as he’s getting smacked hard by some pretty intense waves). And once he does, Helen holds up her end of the bargain by offering to leave with him. But Lawson tells her to stay with her family, then has to run when he sees the police approaching. He and Helen shake hands, and I found myself oddly moved by the moment. The movie also doesn’t even imply that Lawson will be caught – we see him escaping and have hope that he’ll get away.\n\nThere are also a bunch of small moments within the subplot of Doug and Bobby waiting at the jetty for Helen to return that just shine. When the water gets fairly high and Doug suspects Helen might not make it in time, he has a frank conversation with his son, telling Bobby that, if he dies, that Bobby still needs to stay there by the car so that he doesn’t get lost in the desert before Helen can return. Then, when Helen and Lawson arrive in the nick of time, they find Bobby embracing his father as the waves smash into the two men. It’s beautiful and touching.\n\nAlso impressive are the locations. Director John Sturges and cinematographer Victor Milner either built the creepiest jetty I’ve ever seen or found the perfect one on location. It just gives you the chills. And the sequences where Doug is trapped and the tide envelops him are brilliantly staged and choreographed – I’m certain part was done in studio, but I’ll be damned if I can tell the difference between the location shooting and the stuff done on the lot.\n\nThe crew list is an embarrassment of riches – seriously, what were all these great filmmakers doing on this little tiny B-movie? I’m not complaining, but still. First, we’ve got composer Dimitri Tiomkin, who did scores for little movies like “High Noon,” “Dial M For Murder,” “The Fall of the Roman Empire” and “The Guns of Navarone.” Cinematographer Milner was reaching the end of a storied career that included such diverse masterpieces as Lubisch’s “Trouble in Paradise,” DeMille’s “Cleopatra,” Preston Sturges’ “The Lady Eve” and “The Palm Beach Story.” Perhaps the one guy who seemed fit for the project was screenwriter Mel Dinelli, who wrote great (but underseen) noir films like “The Spiral Staircase,” “The Reckless Moment” and “House by the River.”\n\nAnd then there’s director John Sturges, who would go on to helm the wonderful “Bad Day at Black Rock,” “The Magnificent Seven” and “The Great Escape.” Here he keeps the movie moving along at a breakneck pace, building to a fever pitch that you won’t forget and making things like tricky locations and an incoming tide look simple to shoot.\n\n“Jeopardy” really blew me away. For a movie that starts with horrible voiceover that makes you cringe, by the end of the brief running time I cared about everyone involved to the point that I was at the edge of my couch. If you’ve never seen it, track it down, pronto.\n\nScore: ****1/2"
