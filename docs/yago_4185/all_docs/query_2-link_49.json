        "text": "Polish Film Institute\n\nThe Polish Film Institute (PISF) is the newest film institute in Europe, established in 2005 in accordance with a new cinematography law passed by the Polish Parliament. It is set up similar to the mechanisms of support for the film industries in many other countries of Europe.\n\nA declaration by the Council of Film Institutes, adopted in London in 2003, also determines the tasks of the Polish Film Institute: “State Film Institutes in Europe exist to support national and European film cultures and industries. Their role is to intervene in those countries in which the production and distribution of European films requires support.”\n\n1,5% of income of the following entities is contributed to PISF budget: exhibitors, distributors, broadcasters, DTH platforms, cable television providers. Operations of the Polish Film Institute are funded by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.\n\nPoland has a long tradition of quality filmmaking, marked by names such as Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Krzysztof Kieslowski; directors working abroad and contributing to the achievements of the world cinema such as Roman Polanski and Agnieszka Holland; and cinematographers such as Janusz Kaminski and Slawomir Idziak, whose work is recognized and sought after the world over. Their accomplishments set standards of excellence that are being followed by the new generation of Polish filmmakers. The Polish Film Institute exists to help them gain international recognition for their films, and to help Polish cinema restore and maintain its traditional position in the world.\n\nThe Institute's principal task is to provide the Polish film industry with a modern mechanism of support – from the development of film projects, through production, to promotion, distribution and circulation of Polish and European films. We support films from concept to screening, with particular emphasis on international co-productions.\n\nThe Polish Film Institute wants to draw Polish viewers back into theatres to watch Polish films and, at the same time, to make them worthwhile to watch and accessible to international audiences, particularly in Europe."
