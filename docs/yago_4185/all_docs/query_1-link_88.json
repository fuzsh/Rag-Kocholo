Due to its anti-communist themes, the Polish communist government banned the film from public viewing for over seven years until the 1989 dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. The film had its first theatrical release in December 1989 in its native Poland, and was entered into the 1990 Cannes Film Festival as a nomination for the Palme d'Or. Actor Krystyna Janda won the award for Best Actress.\n\nLocation: Florida International University - Modesto A.
