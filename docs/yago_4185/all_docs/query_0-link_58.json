        "text": "Must see if you have the patience - Napoleon review by dl\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n02/12/2016\n\nOver 5 and half hours long 3 discs and 3 sittings and oh my what a film for silent lovers, it was such a joy too watch this at home and at my own pace, It’s a very disjointed film but most of the time it really doesnt matter you get so wrapped up in the visual splendour be it the epic begining of a very young Napoleon waging battle in a snow drenched school field to the epic battle scenes that come later, the way these battles are filmed mostly by handheld camera really are quite astounding to see especially with the deep red tint that fills the screen so vividly, and then there is Napoleon himself played brilliantly by Albert Dieudonne every time he fills the screen it turns into something special the facial expressions the close-ups and the soft glow that always seems to surround his presence by the staggering lighting effects on offer, i’d be lying if i said it was all fantastic as you do get some long lulls especially surrounding the Josephine romance which does go on far too long but its soon replaced by that wonderful epic ending.A magnificent gem filled with great technique powerful performances and spellbinding use of colour.8+/10\n\n3 out of 3 members found this review helpful.\n\nNapoleon (1927) Abel Gance - Napoleon review by Tim Megarry\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n31/12/2021\n\nAbel Gance’s Napoleon (1927), once considered lost but now mostly restored, ranks as a supreme masterpiece of silent cinema which sits proudly alongside the work of WD Griffiths, Pabst, Eisenstein and Lang. It relates Napoleon’s childhood, his involvement with the French Revolution and concludes with his Italian campaign of 1796 and thus biographically remains an unfinished work. But Gance prefigures Hollywood epics forty years into the future in this landmark of film making. Napoleon is innovative and exhilarating in its use of new techniques, on location and in the cutting room, which carry forth a complex and compelling storyline that subtly interweaves an intimate personal narrative with historical events. The sheer scale and ambition of this five and a half hour long film is stunning. Hundreds, if not thousands of actors were involved and a three screen viewing presentation, that anticipates Cinerama and CinemaScope, has been fully reconstructed in the film’s final act. Such pioneering techniques are enhanced by long montage and optical sequences which set a new agenda for cinema. Kevin Brownlow is to be thanked and admired for his painstaking work over so many years in rescuing, conserving and editing this version of Gance’s masterpiece. Carl Davis’s rousing musical score is as monumental as the film it accompanies. Deriving from Hayden and Mozart but mainly from Beethoven the music gives the film the epic quality it deserves. Napoleon must surely be rated as a milestone in cinema history and should become required viewing.\n\nTim Megarry\n\n1 out of 1 members found this review helpful.\n\nSuperb storytelling and cinematography - Napoleon review by RD\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n19/05/2023\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised as soon as we started watching this film.\n\nA 1927 silent film didn't seem like an easy few hours, but we were glued to the screen the whole way through.\n\nThe music soundtrack added to the scenes very well indeed.\n\n1 out of 1 members found this review helpful."
