        "text": "Rivers suffered particularly hard and today are among the most degraded ecosystems. One of the main causes of the water crisis are irresponsible and thoughtless human actions. Until the Last Drop is the latest documentary by the famous director and producer Ewa Ewart, created in co-production with TVN24. Reveals the global costs and consequences of destroying nature \"in the name of progress.\" It is a story about helplessness and desperation, but also about determination and hope. It talks not only about rivers, but also about people who try to save rivers and raise awareness of why the problem is so important. By showing the fight for clean and healthy rivers, the documentary inspires and shows that we too can contribute to solving this crisis. The film was shot in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Albania and Poland."
