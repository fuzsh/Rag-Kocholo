Filmmakers like Roman Polański, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Żuławski, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish film-making. In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made, and with many independent filmmakers of all genres, Polish productions tend to be more inspired by American film.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first cinema was founded in Łódź in 1899, several years after the invention of the Cinematograph. Initially dubbed Living Pictures Theatre, it gained much popularity and by the end of the next decade there were cinemas in almost every major town in Poland. Arguably the first Polish filmmaker was Kazimierz Prószyński, who filmed various short documentaries in Warsaw. His pleograph film camera had been patented before the Lumière brothers' invention and he is credited as the author of the earliest surviving Polish documentary titled Ślizgawka w Łazienkach (Skating-rink in the Royal Baths, also known as On skating-rink[6]), made between 1894 and 1896, as well as the first short narrative films Powrót birbanta (Rake's return home) and Przygoda dorożkarza (Cabman's Adventure), both created in 1902. Another pioneer of cinema was Bolesław Matuszewski, who became one of the first filmmakers working for the Lumière company - and the official \"cinematographer\" of the Russian tsars in 1897.\n\nThe earliest surviving short film is Pruska kultura (Prussian Culture) and the earliest surviving feature film is Antoś pierwszy raz w Warszawie (Antoś for the First Time in Warsaw). Both of them were made in 1908, the first one by an unknown director and the second one by Antoni Fertner. The date of Antoś' première, October 22, 1908, is considered the founding date of the Polish film industry. Soon Polish artists started experimenting with other genres of cinema: in 1910 Władysław Starewicz made one of the first animated cartoons in the world - and the first to use the stop motion technique, the Piękna Lukanida (Beautiful Lukanida). By the start of World War I the cinema in Poland was already in full swing, with numerous adaptations of major works of Polish literature screened (notably the Dzieje grzechu, Meir Ezofowicz and Nad Niemnem).\n\nDuring World War I the Polish cinema crossed borders. Films made in Warsaw or Vilnius were often rebranded with German-language intertitles and shown in Berlin. That was how a young actress Pola Negri (born Barbara Apolonia Chałupiec) gained fame in Germany and eventually became one of the European super-stars of silent film.\n\nThe first woman to direct a film in Poland and the only female film director of the Polish silent film era was Nina Niovilla.[7][8] She debuted in 1918 in Berlin,[7] and then directed her first Polish film[7] titled Tamara (also known under the title Obrońcy Lwowa) in 1919.[7][8]\n\nDuring World War II, Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created the anti-Nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith[9][10][11] (1943) about Nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about Nazi propaganda. It was one of the first anti-Nazi films in history being both an avant-garde and a documentary film.\n\nAfter WWII\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 1945, the communist government founded the film production and distribution organization Film Polski, and put the well-known Polish People's Army filmmaker Aleksander Ford in charge. Starting with a few railway carriages full of film equipment taken from the Germans they proceed to train and build a Polish film industry. The FP output was limited; only thirteen features were released between 1947 and its dissolution in 1952, concentrating on Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis.[12] In 1947, Ford moved to help establish the new National Film School in Łódź, where he taught for 20 years.\n\nThe industry used imported cameras and film stocks. At first ORWO black and white film stock from East Germany and then Eastman colour negative stock and ORWO print stocks for rushes and release prints. Poland made its own lighting equipment. Because of the high costs of film stock Polish films were shot with very low shooting ratios, the amount of film stock used in shooting the film to length of the finished film. The equipment and film stock were not the best and budgets were modest but the film makers received probably the best training in the world from the Polish Film School. Another advantage was Film Polski's status as a state organisation, so its film-makers had access to all Polish institutions and their cooperation in making their films. Film cameras were able to enter almost every aspect of Polish life.\n\nThe first film produced in Poland following the World War II was Zakazane piosenki (1946), directed by Leonard Buczkowski, which was seen by 10.8 million people (out of 23,8 total population) in its initial theatrical run.[13] Buczkowski continued to make films regularly until his death in 1967. Other important films of the early post-World War II period were The Last Stage (1948), directed by Wanda Jakubowska, who continued to make films until the transition from communism to capitalism in 1989, and Border Street (1949), directed by Aleksander Ford.\n\nBy the mid 1950s, following the end of Stalinism in Poland, Film production was organised into film groups. A film group was a collection of film makers, led by an experienced film director and consisting of writers, film directors and production managers. They would write scripts, create budgets, apply for funding off the Ministry of Culture and produce the picture. They would hire actors and crew, and use studios and laboratories controlled by Film Polski.\n\nThe change in political climate gave rise to the Polish Film School movement, a training ground for some of the icons of the world cinematography, e.g., Roman Polanski (Knife in the Water, Rosemary's Baby, Frantic, The Pianist) and Krzysztof Zanussi (a leading director of the so-called cinema of moral anxiety of the 1970s). Andrzej Wajda's films offer insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances. His films defined several Polish generations. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his overall contribution to cinema. Four of his films were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film award at Academy Awards with seven other Polish directors receiving one nomination each: Roman Polański, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Jerzy Hoffman, Jerzy Antczak, Agnieszka Holland, Jan Komasa and Jerzy Skolimowski.[14] In 2015, Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski received this award for his film Ida. In 2019, he was also nominated to the award for his next film Cold War in two categories - Best Foreign Language Film and Best Director.[15]\n\nIt is also important to note that during the 1980s, the People's Republic of Poland instituted the martial law to vanquish and censor all forms of opposition against the communist rule of the nation, including outlets such as cinema and radio. A notable film to have emerged during this period was Ryszard Bugajski's 1982 film Interrogation (Przesluchanie), which depicts the story of an unfortunate woman (played by Krystyna Janda) who is arrested and tortured by the secret police into confessing a crime she knows nothing about. The anti-communist nature of the film brought about the film's over seven-year ban. In 1989, the ban was repealed after the overthrow of the Communist government in Poland, and the film was shown in theaters for the first time later that year. The film is still lauded today for its audacity in depicting the cruelty of the Stalinist regime, as many artists feared persecution during that time.[16][17]\n\nIn the 1990s, Krzysztof Kieślowski won a universal acclaim with productions such as Dekalog (made for television), The Double Life of Véronique and the Three Colors trilogy. Another of the most famous movies in Poland is Krzysztof Krauze’s The Debt, which became a blockbuster.[18] It showed the brutal reality of Polish capitalism and the growth of poverty. A considerable number of Polish film directors (e.g., Agnieszka Holland and Janusz Kamiński) have worked in American studios. Polish animated films - like those by Jan Lenica and Zbigniew Rybczyński (Oscar, 1983) - drew on a long tradition and continued to derive their inspiration from Poland's graphic arts. Other notable Polish film directors include: Tomasz Bagiński, Małgorzata Szumowska, Jan Jakub Kolski, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Stanisław Bareja and Janusz Zaorski.\n\nAmong prominent annual film festivals taking place in Poland are: Warsaw International Film Festival, Camerimage, International Festival of Independent Cinema Off Camera, New Horizons Film Festival as well as Gdynia Film Festival and Polish Film Awards.\n\nCinema audience\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Communist government invested resources into building a sophisticated cinema audience. All the cinema were state owned and consisted of first run premiere cinema, local cinema and art house cinemas. Tickets were cheap and students and old people received discounts. In the city of Lodz there were 36 cinemas in the 1970s showing films from all over the world. There were the Italian films of Fellini, French comedies, American crime movies such as Don Siegel's \"Charley Varrick\" . Films were shown in their original versions with Polish subtitles. Anti-Communist and Cold War films were not shown, but a bigger restriction was the cost of some films. There were popular film magazines like \"Film\" and \"Screen\", critical magazines such as \"Kino\". This all helped to build a well informed film audience.\n\nNotable films\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Polish films\n\nPolish Film Academy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Polish Film Academy was founded in 2003 in Warsaw and aims to provide native filmmakers a forum for discussion and a way to promote the reputation of Polish cinema through publications, presentations, discussions and regular promotion of the subject in the schools.\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 2003, the winners of the Polish Film Awards are elected by the members of the Academy.\n\n2003: The Pianist\n\n2004: Squint Your Eyes\n\n2005: The Wedding\n\n2006: The Collector\n\n2007: Savior Square\n\n2008: Katyń\n\n2009: 33 Scenes from Life\n\n2010: Reverse\n\n2011: Essential Killing\n\n2012: Rose\n\n2013: Manhunt\n\n2014: Ida\n\n2015: Gods\n\n2016: Body\n\n2017: Volhynia\n\n2018: Silent Night\n\n2019: Cold War\n\n2020: Corpus Christi\n\n2021: Kill It and Leave This Town\n\n2022: Quo Vadis, Aida?\n\n2023: EO\n\nFilm schools\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral institutions, both government run and private, provide formal education in various aspects of filmmaking.\n\nNational Film School in Łódź\n\nKrzysztof Kieślowski Film School at University of Silesia in Katowice\n\nSzkoła Aktorska Haliny i Jana Machulskich\n\nSzkoła Wajdy\n\nAMA Film Academy\n\nWarszawska Szkoła Filmowa\n\nPersonalities\n\n[edit]\n\nPoland at international festivals\n\n[edit]\n\n1982 Grand Jury Prize (Imperative, Krzysztof Zanussi)\n\n1984 Golden Lion (A Year of the Quiet Sun, Krzysztof Zanussi)\n\n1993 Golden Lion (Three Colours: Blue, Krzysztof Kieślowski)\n\n2010 Grand Jury Prize (Essential Killing, Jerzy Skolimowski)\n\n2016 Golden Lion Honorary Award (Jerzy Skolimowski)\n\n1971 Golden Leopard (Znaki na drodze, Andrzej Piotrowski)\n\n1973 Golden Leopard (The Illumination, Krzysztof Zanussi)\n\n1986 Golden Leopard (Jezioro Bodenskie, Janusz Zaorski)\n\n2008 Special Jury Prize (33 Scenes from Life, Malgorzata Szumowska)\n\n2016 Best Actor Award (Andrzej Seweryn, The Last Family)\n\n1958 Golden Shell for Best Film (Ewa chce spać, Tadeusz Chmielewski)\n\n1967 Silver Shell for Best Director (Janusz Morgenstern, Yowita)\n\n1976 Silver Shell for Best Actor (Zdzisław Kozien, Skazany)\n\n1980 Golden Shell for Best Film (The Orchestra Conductor, Andrzej Wajda)\n\n1985 Golden Shell for Best Film (Yesterday, Radosław Piwowarski)\n\n1985 Silver Shell for Best Actor (Piotr Siwkiewicz, Yesterday)\n\n1989 Silver Shell for Best Director (Mirosław Bork, Konsul)\n\n1992 Silver Shell for Best Actress (Krystyna Janda, Zwolnieni z życia)\n\n1957 Jury Prize (Kanał, Andrzej Wajda)\n\n1961 Jury Prize (Mother Joan of the Angels, Jerzy Kawalerowicz)\n\n1973 Jury Prize (The Hour-Glass Sanatorium, Wojciech Jerzy Has)\n\n1978 Grand Prix (The Shout, Jerzy Skolimowski)\n\n1980 Jury Prize (The Constant Factor, Krzysztof Zanussi)\n\n1981 Palme d'Or (Man of Iron, Andrzej Wajda)\n\n1982 Best Actress (Jadwiga Jankowska-Cieślak)\n\n1988 Jury Prize (A Short Film About Killing, Krzysztof Kieślowski)\n\n1990 Best Actress (Krystyna Janda)\n\n1998 Cinéfondation (Jakub, Adam Guzinski)\n\n2002 Palme d'Or (The Pianist, Roman Polanski)\n\n2018 Best Director (Cold War, Paweł Pawlikowski)\n\n1965 Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize (Repulsion, Roman Polanski)\n\n1976 Silver Bear for Best Actress (Jadwiga Barańska)\n\n1980 Silver Bear for Best Actor (Andrzej Seweryn)\n\n1981 Silver Bear for Best Actress (Barbara Grabowska)\n\n1982 Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize (Shivers, Wojciech Marczewski)\n\n1994 Silver Bear for Best Director (Three Colors: White, Krzysztof Kieślowski)\n\n2006 Honorary Golden Bear (Andrzej Wajda)\n\n2009 Alfred Bauer Prize (Tatarak, Andrzej Wajda)\n\n2010 Silver Bear for Best Director (The Ghost Writer, Roman Polański)\n\n2015 Silver Bear for Best Director (Body, Malgorzata Szumowska)\n\n2016 Silver Bear for Best Screenplay (United States of Love, Tomasz Wasilewski)\n\n2017 Alfred Bauer Prize (Spoor, Agnieszka Holland)\n\n2018 Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize (Mug, Małgorzata Szumowska)\n\n1942 Academy Honorary Award (Fantasia, Leopold Stokowski)\n\n1954 Academy Award for Best Original Score (Lili, Bronisław Kaper)\n\n1983 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film (Tango, Zbigniew Rybczyński)\n\n1994 Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Schindler's List, Janusz Kamiński)\n\n1994 Academy Award for Best Production Design (Schindler's List, Allan Starski)\n\n1994 Academy Award for Best Production Design (Schindler's List, Ewa Braun)\n\n1999 Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Saving Private Ryan, Janusz Kamiński)\n\n2000 Academy Honorary Award (Andrzej Wajda)\n\n2003 Academy Award for Best Director (The Pianist, Roman Polański)\n\n2005 Academy Award for Best Original Score (Finding Neverland, Jan A.P.
