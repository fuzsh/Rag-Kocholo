        "text": "Kos was the most awarded title at this year’s Polish Film Festival, where it received nine awards including The Grand Prix-Golden Lions Award for Best Film. The title also triumphed at this year's Orły 2024 Polish Film Awards, first receiving the most nominations in the history of the award and then picking up six statuettes, including Best Director for Pawel Maślona. The film stars an award-winning cast including Bartosz Bielenia (Corpus Christi), Jacek Braciak (Leave No Traces), Agnieszka Grochowska (In Darkness) and Robert Więckiewicz (The Wedding Day). Kos will be available to stream exclusively on SkyShowtime from 26 April.\n\nSpring of 1794, Poland is in a state of unrest. General Tadeusz ‘Kos’ Kosciuszko (Jacek Braciak) returns to the country, planning to ignite an uprising against the Russians by mobilizing Polish gentry and peasants. He is accompanied by his faithful friend and former slave, Domingo (Jason Mitchell). Kosciuszko is being tracked down by a merciless Russian cavalry captain, Dunin (Robert Więckiewicz), who wants to do whatever it takes to capture the general before he starts a national revolt. At the same time, a young peasant named Ignac (Bartosz Bielenia), an illegitimate son of a nobleman, dreams of inheriting his father's title and estate. His father, Duchnowski (Andrzej Seweryn) includes him in his will just before his death. When his father passes away, Ignac must flee from his half-brother Stanisław (Piotr Pacek), who refuses to let Ignac fulfill their father's wishes. Ignac steals the will and has only two days to present it to the court and prove his noble title. During his escape, he encounters Domingo, and despite their language barrier, they form a strong bond. Together, they arrive at the mansion of Colonel's wife (Agnieszka Grochowska), where Kosciuszko is hiding, awaiting negotiations with the magnates. Despite ‘Kos's’ initial distrust of Ignac and keeping him in custody, the fate of the uprising will ultimately rest in the hands of the inconspicuous noble bastard. When the decisive moment arrives, Ignac must choose whether to pursue his coat of arms dreams and his father’s legacy or to join ‘Kos’ Kosciuszko in the fight for a greater cause…"
