        "text": "So I looked up what the heck this movie was...\n\n\"Napoleon is an upcoming epic historical drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa. (uh oh, this guy never wrote anything though)\n\nIt stars Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon (WHY???) and depicts the French leader's rise to power. The film is scheduled to be released by Apple Studios on Apple TV+ as an Apple original film. (uh oh)\n\nThe film depicts Napoleon's rise to power through the lens of his addictive and volatile relationship with Empress Joséphine.[1][2] (oh so it is going to be boring )\"\n\n\"On October 14, 2020, the same day his film The Last Duel wrapped filming, Ridley Scott announced, the now titled movie Napoleon, Kitbag as his next project for 20th Century Studios, which he would direct and produce from a screenplay written by Scott's All the Money in the World collaborator David Scarpa. The film's title was derived from the saying, \"There is a general's staff hidden in every soldier's kitbag.\" Joaquin Phoenix was reportedly attached to star as the greatest French General and Emperor of France Napoléon Bonaparte, reuniting him with the director after Gladiator in 2000.[3] However, when Scott's deal with 20th Century Studios concluded by the end of the year, the project became available to other major studios. In January 2021, Apple Studios announced its commitment to finance and produce the film, with shooting scheduled to take place in the United Kingdom in 2022. \"Napoleon is a man I've always been fascinated by\", Scott said in a statement, \"He came out of nowhere to rule everything — but all the while he was waging a romantic war with his adulterous wife Joséphine. He conquered the world to try to win her love, and when he couldn't, he conquered it to destroy her, and destroyed himself in the process.\"[4]\n\n(WTF IS HE TALKING ABOUT?)\n\nThe Last Duel actress Jodie Comer was reportedly Scott's first choice to play Empress Joséphine. (WTF????) She entered negotiations to star in March 2021, confirmed her casting in September, and said, \"I just jumped at the chance to work with Ridley and his team again and the idea of working with Joaquin, who's someone who I hugely admire ... I'm so excited to delve into that world.\"[5][6] In November, she said her role was \"going to be another huge challenge, but what I love about period dramas is that kind of transformation. Even now, doing some costume and hair tests for Kitbag, it's just so exciting because it becomes so much easier to step out of yourself and into somebody else.\"[7] That same month, Youssef Kerkour was confirmed to star.[8] On January 4, 2022, Comer revealed her departure from the film due to scheduling changes caused by the .....-19 pandemic.[1] Vanessa Kirby was announced as her replacement later that day.[2] On January 18, 2022, producer Kevin J. Walsh said the film had been retitled Napoleon.[9] In February, Tahar Rahim was added to the cast.[10]\n\nProduction began in February 2022.[10] The film will feature six major battle sequences, unlike another film featuring Napoleon, Waterloo (1970), that focused on a single battle.[11] Napoleon was shot under the working title Marengo, a reference to the Battle of Marengo (1800).[12] Filming took place in Lincoln, England, in March 2022.[13] The crew reportedly spent a week to prepare Lincoln Cathedral, which stood in for Notre-Dame de Paris. Shooting took place in the cathedral on March 17 and March 18, between 7 am and 7 pm.[14][15][16]\n\n(SO UNLESS THIS IS LIKE A 6 HOUR RUNTIME THESE BATTLES WILL SUCK)\n\nFilming also took place at Stowe Avenue and House, Buckinghamshire; Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire;[17][18][19] West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire, England;[20], Petworth House in Sussex, England,[21] and Boughton House in Kettering, England.[22] It was also set to shoot in Malta for three weeks, starting in May 2022. Fort Ricasoli in Kalkara, Malta, is set to be transformed into the site of 1793's siege of Toulon, where Napoleon had his first victory.[23][24][25]\"\n\nCast\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Napoleon Bonaparte (Why though?)\n\nVanessa Kirby as Empress Joséphine (Why though?)\n\nTahar Rahim as Paul Barras (WTF????)\n\nBen Miles as Coulancourt (mkay)\n\nLudivine Sagnier as Theresa Cabarrus (LITERALLY WHO?)\n\nMatthew Needham as Lucien Bonaparte (mkay)\n\nYoussef Kerkour as General Davout (WTF????)\n\nPhil Cornwell as Sanson 'The Borreau' (LITERALLY WHO?)\n\nEdouard Philipponnat as Tsar Alexander (mkay)\n\nIan McNeice\n\nPaul Rhys as Talleyrand (kay?)\n\nJohn Hollingworth as Marshal Ney (WTF????)\n\nWhy is there Theresa Cabarrus and Sanson the Borreau even in this story? Who the heck are these people? Honestly its comes off like Ridley Scott barely knows who Napoleon is, skimmed through a Wikipedia article and then wrote a story about who he thinks Napoleon is.\n\nSome of these casting choices are absurd. Why don't they cast Jackie Chan as police minister Fouche? The most offensive castings are probably Tahar Rahim as Paul Barras. That doesn't even make sense. But John Hollingworth as Marshal Ney... where is Ney's fiery red hair?\n\nCan we just put Ridley Scott out to pasture already. I think this old warhorse needs to be retired. None of this makes sense to me. Throw in Apple TV and I am even more confused.\n\nCould you send me the link to the thread? Would love to see the ....-show that went down.\n\n....is it bad if I'm from Gen Z and I don't know half of the actors you mentioned? I have lately lost general interest in movies so I haven't really been keeping up with things, and even when I was a casual movie watcher, I still didn't care much for the actors and their names, only the characters they portrayed.\n\nAren't you in Pakistan though?\n\nDid you watch RRR? Much better movie.\n\nI never heard of these kids either. Only heard of Zendaya, I think she was in Spiderman.\n\nBatista is a wrestler who was in Marvel movies.\n\nOnly know of Timothy's Omelet from that awful movie \"The King\".\n\nWait, you've seen The Message? If so, what did you think of it? Also, regarding Cleopatra, are you talking about the 1960s Cleopatra movie?\n\nThe Message was alright. I am not sure how much of it was accurate to history though. Anthony Quinn does a good job as usual in his (third role?) as an Arab. But I didn't like how they didn't actually show Muhammad in the movie, I guess the work around was interesting but still.\n\nYes, I am referring to the 1960's Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor. It wasn't a great movie or great screen play by any means. Elizabeth Taylor was average. I think they case her because she was a big star at the time, but this movie made her so much bigger (she was paid at least $1 million, the most an actress was ever paid, and was a huge amount).\n\nThe best casting choices were definitely Rex Harrison as Caesar and Richard Burton as Marcus Antonius. While Roddy MacDowell gets a lot of praise for his portrayal of Octavian I personally thought that he made Octavian seem like an absolute nut job. So I didn't really like that aspect of his Octavian. Although Richard Burton's performance often gets criticized as well, and I am not sure why. I thought his performance as Marcus Antonius was excellent, at least for theater.\n\nThe main problem for me with this movie is their aesthetic which is not that accurate. Cleopatra is dressed like an Egyptian, everything in this movie looks Egyptian... but Cleopatra was a Macedonian in the Hellenistic era. Also Elizabeth Taylor's look doesn't really do it for me to tell you the truth. I am sure she is very attractive but I never liked her. That being said I can't think of any actress of that time who could play Cleopatra convincingly. I mean someone at the studio must have thought the same because she was the first person to be cast. They originally cast two different actors to play Caesar and Marcus Antonius but they quit after the set in Britain was destroyed by a storm. Then they had to ask for more money and move production down to Italy.\n\nThat is the main reason why the actual screen play is so average, the studio and everyone involved were flying by the seat of their pants and spent millions of dollars on what could have been a simple project. Originally there were like 6 hours of footage and they cut it down to only two hours. The script was secondary (for some odd reason) and their original script was scrapped and they rewrote the script as they went. So the studio probably correctly decided to make this movie about the spectacle. They went with big sets, huge processions and lots of pomp. Then put marketing into overdrive and charged double for tickets.\n\nThis movie made a return probably because of the double priced tickets. What this movie really accomplished was putting Elizabeth Taylor into stardom, it also led to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton getting married (sort of like the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie of their day). But most of all it became a cultural icon for decades. I like Cleopatra decently enough, but for me my favorite movies of this era and style are actually Ben-Hur (with Charlton Heston), The Ten Commandments (also Charlton Heston), Alexander (also starring Richard Burton), and Hercules (with Steve Reeves). A shout out to: Lion of the Desert (with Anthony Quinn), Lawrence of Arabia (Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness), The Fall of the Roman Empire (Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd), El Cid (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren), and The Lion in Winter (Peter O'Toole and a very good cast).\n\nIt is still on my \"Watch before I die\" list. I have heard a lot of great things about it. How much of it would you say is historical and how much of it isn't.\n\n2010 Three Kingdoms isn't that historical to tell you the truth. It is basically an adaptation of the ancient novel Romance of Three Kingdoms but with a twist. The deviate from the main narrative by using Record of Three Kingdoms and Cao Man Zhuan. But it is a pretty good political and war narrative.\n\nThe show doesn't exist for the battles, that is basically filler. More so it is for the political intrigue and strategy. I think the reason it became so popular was precisely because it deviated from the Romance narrative. But also because the actor who plays Cao Cao was so good.\n\nIn China this show is a big deal because Three Kingdoms gets an adaptation every decade. But after John Woo made his huge movie Red Cliffs, it has gotten more popular. So now they make them like every year or every other year. In 2013 they made a show just called \"Cao Cao\" and then in 2018 I think they released a two part series about Sima Yi called \"Advisors Alliance\" and \"Growling Tiger Roaring Dragon\".\n\nBit off topic, but I would also like to know what you think of Kingdom of Heaven and where it ranks for you.\n\nI think the narrative sucks, the movie is ahistorical as heck, and borderline offensive. But that said I actually enjoyed it. I prefer the director's cut. There is something so fulfilling about watching hundreds of extras execute a battle scene that modern CG movies can't provide.\n\nFor me it is a guilty pleasure. I think for the first time I didn't hate seeing Orlando Bloom in a movie. Also the other actors like Guy de Lusignan, Reynald de Chatillon, and Saladin were great. Seeing David Thewlis and Liam Neeson was cool too.\n\nFor me it is better than Gladiator. If Gladiator had more battles and less gladiators I think I would enjoy it more. But is it stands I find Gladiator very overrated. To me it is a failed attempt like similar movies such as Troy, and personally Red Cliffs an epic scale Chinese film but one which completely fails for me.\n\nIn so far as Chinese movies go I would rather watch \"Hero\" or \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\". Definitely go watch 2010 Three Kingdoms, The Last Supper (not a Jesus movie), Advisors Alliance, and Epic of Qin. The same studio that made 2010 Three Kingdoms also made Chu-Han Contention (or was it Chu-Han Legend?), I still haven't been able to see it but I hear it is a good show.\n\nI would also recommend The Guns of Navarone in case you haven't watched it. It was an important part of my childhood as it is a favourite film of my father's and he would watch it all the time and I would watch it with him. He hates the newer movies that have militaries operating in them, because he says this isn't at all how the military operates with the way they go into everything guns blazing, which I guess you can't argue with. He is a retired Colonel and did command a handful of tanks back in the day when he was operating in Balochistan against insurgents so I'm willing to bet he knows a thing or two about how things would actually work in a modern military.\n\nYeah I've seen The Guns of Navarone, Dam Busters, The Great Escape, Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Rommel, Band of Brothers, MacArthur, Bridge on the River Kwai. Lawrence of Arabia and Lion of the Desert if they count as war movies. Also The Pacific, and Saving Private Ryan, which honestly I think sucked as movies. The only interesting part to Saving Private Ryan is the D-Day sequence, the rest is awful. While The Pacific was boring drama, even the battles kind of sucked until the last two episodes.\n\nThe one I always wanted to watch was City of Life and Death, a Chinese movie about the Battle of Nanjing. I would watch more foreign movies about wars if I knew what they even were. I don't really like current era subjects though, I might watch Generation Kill but I'm not sure.\n\nAren't you in Pakistan though?\n\nDid you watch RRR? Much better movie.\n\nYes I am in Pakistan, and no, I haven't watched RRR. Like I said, I have lately lost interest in movies. I literally had to look up RRR to see what you're talking about, lol. I didn't even know a movie of that title had been released.\n\nThe Message was alright. I am not sure how much of it was accurate to history though. Anthony Quinn does a good job as usual in his (third role?) as an Arab. But I didn't like how they didn't actually show Muhammad in the movie, I guess the work around was interesting but still.\n\nYeah, depicting any of the Prophets is a big no-no for us. That goes for the other Prophets as well, such as Noah, Moses, Jesus Christ etc. It goes back to a few different issues that the early Muslim community had to deal with on the matter of the status of a Prophet, the Prophet was adamant about people not praising him too greatly as he feared that those who come after would take it too far and that he would be worshipped like Jesus:-\n\nNarrated `Umar:\n\nI heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, \"Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am only a Slave. So, call me the Slave of Allah and His Apostle.\" (Sahih al Bukhari 3445)\n\nAlong with that, portrayals of the Prophet on film would inevitably mean that people would start associating the actor with the historical figure despite the fact that the historical figure likely didn't look anything like the actor playing him, which would likely only lead to misleading stereotypes. With the Companions, there can be some leverage with regards to this, but portrayals of any Prophets is where we draw the line. I hope that you can understand our perspective on the issue, even if you don't necessarily agree with it.\n\nIt's been a while since I have seen The Message so I'll have to watch it to see how much of it is accurate.\n\nBen-Hur (with Charlton Heston), The Ten Commandments (also Charlton Heston), Alexander (also starring Richard Burton), and Hercules (with Steve Reeves). A shout out to: Lion of the Desert (with Anthony Quinn), Lawrence of Arabia (Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness), The Fall of the Roman Empire (Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd), El Cid (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren), and The Lion in Winter (Peter O'Toole and a very good cast).\n\nI'm just gonna put these movies in my \"to watch\" list. Yes, I have seen a few of them, but now I gotta watch all of them, since your taste in movies is good. And if you're giving them a shout out, I'll likely enjoy them too.\n\n2010 Three Kingdoms isn't that historical to tell you the truth. It is basically an adaptation of the ancient novel Romance of Three Kingdoms but with a twist. The deviate from the main narrative by using Record of Three Kingdoms and Cao Man Zhuan. But it is a pretty good political and war narrative.\n\nThe show doesn't exist for the battles, that is basically filler.\n\nAww, I thought it would be like 50 percent historical or something. Shame the battles and campaigns aren't the main focus (that might just be my heavy bias towards military history) but Chinese politics also are quite enjoyable.\n\nI think the narrative sucks, the movie is ahistorical as heck, and borderline offensive. But that said I actually enjoyed it. I prefer the director's cut. There is something so fulfilling about watching hundreds of extras execute a battle scene that modern CG movies can't provide.\n\nYeah, the narrative could have been much better. Also, hell yes to the hundreds of extras having large scale battle.\n\nDefinitely go watch 2010 Three Kingdoms, The Last Supper (not a Jesus movie), Advisors Alliance, and Epic of Qin. The same studio that made 2010 Three Kingdoms also made Chu-Han Contention (or was it Chu-Han Legend?), I still haven't been able to see it but I hear it is a good show.\n\nI will certainmy watch them when I get the time.\n\nAlso The Pacific, and Saving Private Ryan, which honestly I think sucked as movies. The only interesting part to Saving Private Ryan is the D-Day sequence, the rest is awful.\n\nFinally! Someone else who thinks Saving Private Ryan was a boring movie. I haven't watched The Pacific, so can't comment on that.\n\nThe one I always wanted to watch was City of Life and Death, a Chinese movie about the Battle of Nanjing.\n\n.... are you trying to fill up all the slots I have to watch different movies for this year? Like bro chill, you can't keep loading your posts with so many high quality movie recommendations. They don't make high quality movies fast enough ti keep with the rate at which you're planning on watching them.\n\nSo I looked up what the heck this movie was...\n\n\"Napoleon is an upcoming epic historical drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa.

Walsh said the film had been retitled Napoleon.[9] In February, Tahar Rahim was added to the cast.[10]\n\nProduction began in February 2022.[10] The film will feature six major battle sequences, unlike another film featuring Napoleon, Waterloo (1970), that focused on a single battle.[11] Napoleon was shot under the working title Marengo, a reference to the Battle of Marengo (1800).[12] Filming took place in Lincoln, England, in March 2022.[13] The crew reportedly spent a week to prepare Lincoln Cathedral, which stood in for Notre-Dame de Paris. Shooting took place in the cathedral on March 17 and March 18, between 7 am and 7 pm.[14][15][16]\n\n(SO UNLESS THIS IS LIKE A 6 HOUR RUNTIME THESE BATTLES WILL SUCK)\n\nFilming also took place at Stowe Avenue and House, Buckinghamshire; Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire;[17][18][19] West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire, England;[20], Petworth House in Sussex, England,[21] and Boughton House in Kettering, England.[22] It was also set to shoot in Malta for three weeks, starting in May 2022. Fort Ricasoli in Kalkara, Malta, is set to be transformed into the site of 1793's siege of Toulon, where Napoleon had his first victory.[23][24][25]\"\n\nCast\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Napoleon Bonaparte (Why though?)\n\nVanessa Kirby as Empress Joséphine (Why though?)\n\nTahar Rahim as Paul Barras (WTF????)\n\nBen Miles as Coulancourt (mkay)\n\nLudivine Sagnier as Theresa Cabarrus (LITERALLY WHO?)\n\nMatthew Needham as Lucien Bonaparte (mkay)\n\nYoussef Kerkour as General Davout (WTF????)\n\nPhil Cornwell as Sanson 'The Borreau' (LITERALLY WHO?)\n\nEdouard Philipponnat as Tsar Alexander (mkay)\n\nIan McNeice\n\nPaul Rhys as Talleyrand (kay?)\n\nJohn Hollingworth as Marshal Ney (WTF????)\n\nWhy is there Theresa Cabarrus and Sanson the Borreau even in this story? Who the heck are these people? Honestly its comes off like Ridley Scott barely knows who Napoleon is, skimmed through a Wikipedia article and then wrote a story about who he thinks Napoleon is.\n\nSome of these casting choices are absurd. Why don't they cast Jackie Chan as police minister Fouche? The most offensive castings are probably Tahar Rahim as Paul Barras. That doesn't even make sense. But John Hollingworth as Marshal Ney... where is Ney's fiery red hair?\n\nCan we just put Ridley Scott out to pasture already. I think this old warhorse needs to be retired. None of this makes sense to me. Throw in Apple TV and I am even more confused.\n\nI share your concerns. The minute I saw that both Lannes and Berthier were not cast, I was pretty much \"WTF?\"\n\nEDIT: something cut out half this post:\n\nI agree with your commentary on the casting decisions. I had more to add, but it got deleted and I am tired. I will only say this: I am not opposed to a Morrocan playing Davout: he at least looks the part. I only hope he plays Davout faithfully.\n\n\" \"He came out of nowhere to rule everything — but all the while he was waging a romantic war with his adulterous wife Joséphine. He conquered the world to try to win her love, and when he couldn't, he conquered it to destroy her, and destroyed himself in the process.\"\"\n\nI used to respect Ridley Scott. Its like he is writing Napoleon fanfiction that seems to be a bad mix of \"slash-fic\" and bad romantic fanboyism, with Napoleon \"Edward Cullen\" Bonaparte.\n\nLannes was Napoleon's best friend, and probably one of the biggest influences on his life. The Grande Armee succeeded in large part due to Berthier. To do a film about either his personal life, his military life, or both, and exclude Lannes and Berthier is extremely suspect.\n\nI share your concerns.

Actually I don't get why they didn't just only cast French people, for the most part.\n\n\" \"He came out of nowhere to rule everything — but all the while he was waging a romantic war with his adulterous wife Joséphine.

I just assumed Ridley Scott copied it or made an adaptation of it or something. The ending is even similar.\n\nKingdom of Heaven by comparison I found to be less offensive. I just assumed it was fantasy from the start. That said a lot of people disliked it for those inaccuracies, and I don't blame them.\n\nLannes was Napoleon's best friend, and probably one of the biggest influences on his life.

To do a film about either his personal life, his military life, or both, and exclude Lannes and Berthier is extremely suspect.\n\nI guess that is the issue of trying to mythologize Napoleon's career. He is being painted into some kind of narrative like they did with Alexander and Caesar. But those are some rather basic stories that have similar problems. Much of the common understanding of Caesar, or Cleopatra, and so on comes from things like Shakespeare.\n\nWhen it comes to Napoleon's inner circle there are a lot of people that should be cast. There are Murat, Berthier, I think Desaix for sure, probably Marmont, Geraud Duroc, and Lannes. But Talleyrand and Fouche are also relevant. Barras not so much, he is out of the picture by 1797 when the Abbe Sieyes seizes power.\n\nIn the context of the Napoleon story, I am unsure why Davout was even cast. If you watch Waterloo there is no Davout, the most prominent officer is Ney. In the 2002 Napoleon there is no Davout either. Only time I've seen Davout was in the old BBC adaptation of War & Peace."
