        "text": "SAMSON offers products and systems to control all kinds of media. We specialize in control valve engineering. As a trendsetter for over 100 years, we drive forward new developments and introduce innovations to the market. We have had a considerable impact on the evolution of valves from analog components to smart control valves. We are now fully focusing on the opportunities provided to us through Industry 4.0.\n\nSAMSON's valves can be tailored to the specific control task.\n\nThe modular design of our valves enables us to provide a wide variety of valves, such as globe vales, angle valves, three-way valves, in all commonly available in valve sizes, pressure ratings, and materials, with exchangeable trims, bellows seals or insulating sections. Special versions for cryogenic applications and for steam conditioning round off the range. Many of our valve models can be fitted with either a pneumatic or electric actuator.\n\n» Find valves\n\nSAMSON has been selling self-operated regulators since its foundation in 1907.\n\nThey are used where temperature, pressure, differential pressure, and/or flow rate are to be controlled to constant value and where small steady-state errors can be tolerated.\n\n» Find self-operated regulators\n\nActuators convert the control signal supplied by automation equipment into a linear or rotary motion used to position the valve.\n\nSAMSON develops and manufactures pneumatic linear and rotary actuators as well as electric linear actuators with or without fail-safe action. The electric actuators with process controllers are fitted with a digital controller and combine the functions of the automation equipment and actuator in one device.\n\n» Find actuators\n\nFitted with valve accessories, control valves serve as engineered solutions for almost any application (e.g. simple on/off valves, control valves with diagnostics for predictive maintenance, SIL-certified valves for safety-instrumented systems).\n\nWe offer the entire control valve assembly consisting of the valve, actuator, and accessories (e.g. positioner, limit switch, or solenoid valve) perfectly tailored to one another.\n\n» Find valve accessories\n\nSignal converters are used in cases where the signal must be converted before it can be used by a device.\n\nSAMSON i/p converters are used to convert an electric signal issued by automation equipment into a pneumatic signal, for example, for valve control.\n\n» Find signal converters\n\nAutomation systems are used in the process industry, building automation, and in the tank filling process.\n\nMost electric automation systems by SAMSON can be controlled from remote locations and feature alarm management and data logging functions. Besides electric automation systems, we are one of very few manufacturers who still have pneumatic automation systems in their product range.\n\n» Find automation system\n\nSAMSON sensors and thermostats are used in building automation.\n\nOur sensors measure the temperature in heating and DHW circuits. They are easily combinable with our automation systems. Thermostats are used in local heat supplies and district heating systems to limit, monitor or control the temperature in pipelines.\n\n» Find sensors and thermostats\n\nOur scope of services covers all stages of the product life cycle. It includes simple troubleshooting as well as comprehensive service agreements for entire projects. We provide the services our customers need to ensure the availability of their plants and production processes in the long term.\n\n» After Sales Service"
