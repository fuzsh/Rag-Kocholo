        "text": "Open your mind. Open your eyes.\n\nâ€”Original slogan.\n\nMeanwhile, at Valve...\n\nValve Software was founded in 1996 by former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Once they secured a license to use the Quake engine, Valve set about to create their first game... Half-Life was released in 1998 and ever since, Valve has been known for their revolutionary and amazing First-Person action games. In 2004, they launched one of the first digital distribution platforms, along with the sequel to Half-Life which used it exclusively -- and thus was born Steam, which went on to become the biggest digital distribution platform for Windows and a license to print money for Valve.\n\nAnd, because Valve is such a small company, they have developed something of a reputation for having literally more money than they know what to do with. A fair bit of it seems to go into flying fans out to visit their headquarters. Just don't get presumptuous.\n\nValve's in-house game engine (Source, the successor to their Quake-based GoldSrc engine) is publicly available for other commercial developers to license, but for those interested in creating free mods, the level editor and several other modding tools are available for free with the purchase of any game. (And most of the other handy tools have been developed by third parties as freeware.) To this end, the engine has become the basis for a legendary number of mods, including several that function as standalone games in their own right.\n\nIn fact, roughly half of Valve's own oeuvre -- Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress and the free Alien Swarm -- were originally the product of mod teams, who were then recruited to work for Valve and whose games were re-released as commercial titles. Of its flagship titles, only the Half-Life series was actually created by Valve directly; Portal was adapted from a concept game made by a bunch of college students, and Left 4 Dead was started by another company that Valve later bought out. Make of that what you will.\n\nIn March 2010, they announced that they would be porting Steam, the Source Engine, and their entire back catalog to Mac OS X. Mac users everywhere rejoiced, while some PC gamers complained about Valve dumbing down their games. At the time of writing, all their games from 2004 have been ported, in some form. In June 2010, at E3, Gabe Newell made a surprise announcement that Portal 2 and Steam would be coming to the Playstation 3 to thunderous applause.\n\nTheir games are popularly well regarded, at the expense of punctuality. They are also a frequent source of memes.\n\nThey also have fairly active blogs for their big games. Using a hilarious blend of Self-Deprecation and Blatant Lies, they deliver news about their games and their inevitable delays.\n\nThey now have a level one Sentry Gun in their lobby. They also have the absolute best snack bar in the whole gaming industry. [1]\n\nIn April 2012, their employee handbook [dead link] was leaked to the Internet. A very informative piece, that somehow manages to make them even more awesome.[2]\n\nGames developed by Valve:\n\nHalf-Life (1998)\n\nHalf-Life 2 (2004)\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode 1 (2006)\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode 2 (2007)\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx (2020)\n\nTeam Fortress Classic (1999)\n\nTeam Fortress 2 (2007)\n\nCounter-Strike (2000)\n\nRicochet (2000)\n\nDay Of Defeat (2003)\n\nPortal (2007)\n\nPortal 2 (2011)\n\nLeft 4 Dead (2008)\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 (2009)\n\nAlien Swarm (2010)\n\nDota 2 (2012)\n\nArtifact (2018)\n\nDota Underlords (2019)\n\nThird-party games and mods that use Valve's Source engine:\n\nDark Messiah\n\nGarry's Mod\n\nPostal III\n\nThe Ship\n\nSin Episodes: Emergence\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines\n\nZeno Clash\n\nDystopia\n\nVindictus\n\nNuclear Dawn\n\nE.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy\n\nValve Corporation provides examples of the following tropes:\n\nArc Number: For some bizarre reason, Valve is continually stuck on 2. None of their series ever seem to reach a 3rd game. (Thus spawning the meme \"Valve can't count to three!\") Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Portal 2, Manchester United 0. Now they're even making a second game for a series they didn't start.\n\nNot to mention they're on their second engine; the increasingly dated Source engine.\n\nFinally broken by the release of the third and final segment of the Portal 2 soundtrack, and there being a total of four videos before Portal 2's release showing the various new features. However, Valve has made two Portal 2 comics, and one DLC so far, so it's unknown if they shall get beyond three again.\n\nIt should be noted that one of the four Portal 2 concepts was never implemented, making it only three in total that were worth anything.\n\nBadass Bookworm: Gordon Freeman, The Engineer, and The Medic.\n\nBig Fun: Gabe Newell[3], the face of Valve. As well as Heavy Weapons Guy!\n\nBody Horror: No, not Gabe[4][5], but the logos used, with valves coming out of the human body.\n\nDigital Distribution: The Steam service.\n\nEverything's Better with Plushies: The Tank, Hunter, and Boomer!\n\nMedics, Engineer Bears, Voodoo Spies, and Stickybombs!\n\nWeighted Companion Cubes, Turrets, and Wheatley!\n\nHeadcrabs and Santa Vortigaunts!\n\nEye Scream: The original logo.\n\nFeathered Fiend: In Portal 2, they attack robots. In Left 4 Dead, they dickishly awaken hordes of zombies with very sensitive hearing. In Team Fortress 2, they enjoy flying into open wounds."
