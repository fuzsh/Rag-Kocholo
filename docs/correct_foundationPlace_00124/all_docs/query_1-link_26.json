        "text": "Boil Order Rescinded for Parts of Beverly, Morgan Park, and Auburn Gresham\n\nThe Department of Water Management has rescinded the boil order issued on July 9, 2024 for the buildings and homes located east of Sacramento Avenue, north of 119th Street, west of I-57, south of 87th Street, and southwest of Beverly Avenue.\n\nThe order has been lifted after microbiological contamination was ruled out by tests conducted by the Department of Water Managementâ€™s Water Purification Laboratories.\n\nThe water is safe to drink and use for consumption.\n\nPrevent basement flooding\n\nAs our climate changes, we are seeing more intense storms than we have in past years. Our sewer system can get overwhelmed by these huge downpours and more of us are finding water in our basements. In Chicago, the sewer system also handles rainwater removal. The Chicago Department of Water Management is working closely with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to increase the capacity of our drainage systems.\n\nThere are some steps homeowners can take to help prevent water from backing up into their basements:\n\nDisconnect downspout connections from the sewer system.\n\nMake sure to direct downspout flow to areas with permeable surfaces that can properly absorb the stormwater or use rain barrels to collect the water directly from the downspouts.\n\nAvoid running a dishwasher or washing machine during storms.\n\nClear the area around downspouts to allow water to flow freely away from your foundation.\n\nClear drains and sewers of debris and snow to allow drainage for melting.\n\nDo not dump fats/oils/greases in private drains or public catch basins.\n\nFor better resistance to flooding in the future, it can be helpful to install rain gardens, green landscaping, or stormwater trees in your yard to help retain rainwater.\n\nFlooding Information Flyer\n\nFlushing Your Water System\n\nIf your water service has been replaced or you have not used your water for six hours or more, it is important to flush your plumbing of any sediment, rust or metals, including any lead to maintain water quality.\n\nConsumer Lead Testing Results and Requests\n\nConstruction Projects\n\nNeighborhood construction projects involving water and sewer main replacements."
