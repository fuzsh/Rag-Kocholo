        "text": "Mike Mussallem likes to say he’s “in the heart business.”\n\nAnd in more ways than one.\n\nAs the first and only chief executive of Edwards Lifesciences, Mussallem has transformed his company from a debt-ridden spinoff into a leading manufacturer of replacement heart valves behind some of the biggest cardiac care breakthroughs this century.\n\nRELATED: See the full list of the 100 Most Influential in Orange County for 2018\n\nOver the past 18 years, company value jumped 4,000 percent, employment doubled to nearly 13,000 in 40 nations (4,600 in Orange County) and its Irvine headquarters expanded to 11 buildings on 40 acres. It’s still growing.\n\nIn November, the Harvard Business Review named Mussallem to its list of the world’s best-performing CEOs for the fourth time in five years, ranking him 15th out of 881 corporate chiefs.\n\nBut that’s not the only way Mussallem is “in the heart business.”\n\nEdwards — at Mussallem’s direction — is also a business with heart.\n\n“We’re believers that we should be givers to our community, not takers,” the lanky, easy-going Mussallem, dressed in a blue blazer, slacks and an open-collared shirt, said recently during a chat in Edwards’ newly remodeled, stadium-like lobby.\n\nEdwards’ goal is to have every employee “give back” by participating in charitable or community work. A company foundation has provided education, screening and treatment to more than 1 million “underserved” patients.\n\nMussallem leads by example.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Mussallem and his wife, Linda, set up a philanthropic fund at the Orange County Community Foundation, making grants to help the disabled, support education and “and just plain give back to our local community.”\n\nIt’s not just checkbook philanthropy, either. The CEO, who made $10.8 million last year, and his wife donate their time as well as their money.\n\n“What makes Mike Mussallem so unique is the pairing of his extraordinary leadership on both the corporate front and the philanthropic front,” said Shelley Hoss, Orange County Community Foundation president.\n\nSome folks are extraordinarily gifted at leading profitable companies, Hoss said. Others at giving back.\n\n“Mike equally excels in both of those arenas.”\n\nThe George and Bob Fund\n\nMussallem was a typical Indiana boy growing up in an atypical household during the 1950s.\n\nHe had a paper route. He worked in the steel mills to pay for college.\n\nAnd he adored his big brother, George.\n\nEvery day, George repeatedly told Mussallem, “I love you.”\n\nThere was something else. George Mussallem had Down syndrome.\n\nToday, about one out of every 700 babies has Down syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a distinct facial appearance, intellectual disability and sometimes physical ailments. The condition was even rarer when George was born in October 1950.\n\nHere’s how one doctor described George’s condition to his parents: “Your son is a Mongoloid idiot.”\n\n“Think about that. How crushing for those proud parents to hear that,” Mussallem, 66, said in November during a keynote address at the O.C. Community Foundation’s annual meeting.\n\nThe family wondered if they should put George in a home. But his parents decided to raise him themselves, his mother giving up her career as an insurance company office manager.\n\n“This is not a sad story. It’s a super happy story,” Mussallem said. “George turned out to be an absolute gift to our family. Just so full of love and joy.”\n\nThe three Mussallem boys were raised as equals. Their mother dressed them alike, put them in silly hats, taught them to sing for relatives.\n\nThrough his mother’s perseverance, George learned how to spell, read, do math and handle money. He eventually got married and got a job.\n\n“He achieved much more than I ever achieved in my life, just considering where he came from,” Mussallem said.\n\nWhen Mussallem was dating his future wife, he discovered that her older brother, Bob, also had Down syndrome. Linda’s experience was identical to his own.\n\n“Now fast forward to us being able to do some things and give back to the community,” Mussallem said. “We knew what the theme was going to be. We called (our fund) the George and Bob Fund. So our theme is all about Down syndrome.”\n\nThey’re supporting a medical group that specializes in treating Downs patients. They support the Glennwood House in Laguna Beach, a home for adults with special needs, where Linda also works as a volunteer.\n\nThey have other causes as well, and recently, the new student union at Mussallem’s alma mater, the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., was named for them in recognition of their financial support.\n\nBut the George and Bob Fund, Mussallem said, “is something that we’re most proud of.”\n\n‘A cool company’\n\nLowell Edwards, an engineer specializing in fuel pumps, never realized his dream of building an artificial heart. Instead, he invented the first commercially available heart valve.\n\nEdwards’ Santa Ana company was acquired in 1966, then resold before it was spun off on its own again in 2000.\n\nLike Edwards, Mussallem is an engineer, but he was dissatisfied with his specialty in chemical engineering. He knew chemical engineers were paid well. He hadn’t realized most end up in chemical plants and oil refineries.\n\nHis first job was at Union Carbide making Prestone Antifreeze.\n\n“It was a good experience for me, but after a few years there, it wasn’t particularly motivating,” he said.\n\nBy 1979, he grew interested in medical technology, taking a job with medical device maker Baxter International Inc., then-owner of Edwards.\n\n“I immediately fell in love with it. Not only was it high impact on patients’ lives, it was kind of personal,” Mussallem said. “There are real patients who were behind what we did. What a cool company.”\n\nWhen Edwards was about to be spun off, Mussallem said, “I raised my hand.” He became its first CEO.\n\nAt the time, it was the poorest performing unit at Baxter, he said. It had $550 million in debt and a net value around $230 million.\n\n“(But) we had an enthusiastic group. We had big eyes and big dreams about what we could do, and people were all the way in, as I was,” Mussallem said. “We really believed that we could build something special.”\n\nToday, Edwards’ total stock value exceeds $32 billion.\n\nA game changer\n\nThe company had both successes and setbacks, but one big bet in 2004 proved to be “a game changer” for Edwards — and for medical science.\n\nThat’s when Edwards put virtually all its chips on a developing procedure called TAVR or transcatheter aortic valve replacement.\n\nIn the 11 years since Europe approved the procedure, more than 350,000 patients have undergone the non-invasive treatment, Edwards said. Among them, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, now 95.\n\nThe story starts as a race to develop an alternative to open heart surgery for aortic valve stenosis. That’s a condition where the valve at the tip of the aorta — the body’s largest artery — narrows, often to the size of a pencil, impeding blood flow. It can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, congestive heart failure and sometimes death.\n\nCardiac care has made miraculous strides in recent decades, with surgeons able to cut out diseased valves and sew in artificial replacements made from cow and pig tissue.\n\nBut until TAVR, at least 100,000 patients in the U.S. were too old or frail to undergo the ordeal of having their chests cracked open, their hearts stopped, their blood flow taken over by a heart-lung machine, followed by open-heart surgery.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a Danish cardiologist floated the idea of snaking a collapsed artificial valve through the body’s veins from the leg into the heart, then inflating a balloon to wedge the new valve into the aorta. If it worked, many critically ill patients could be saved.\n\nBy the early 2000s, a French doctor, Alain Cribier, working with a team in Israel, was perfecting the technique. Edwards was among the competitors developing a rival procedure.\n\n“We had a big debate whether we thought we were going to prevail or whether this little company that had 17 guys in Israel was going to prevail,” Mussallem said. “And we decided, let’s buy it.”\n\nTaking on debt, Edwards paid $125 million to buy Cribier’s company in 2004.\n\n“It was a heavy lift for us financially. But our attitude was if this could change the world, it has to be us. We’re the leaders, it has to be us. We couldn’t sleep otherwise.”\n\nOvercoming skeptics\n\nThe procedure had its skeptics.\n\nLeading cardiologists said the TAVR procedure would not work.\n\nHow would the valve stay in place without sutures? Would there be a danger of blood clots and stroke?\n\nThen, in 2005, Edwards halted initial trials.\n\nThe company found that most doctors lacked the skill to replicate Cribier’s expertise in snaking a catheter through the chambers of the heart to the aorta.\n\nStuck with an expensive investment that wasn’t working, Edwards had to modify the procedure. What if they went up an artery in the leg and through the aorta without going through the heart?\n\nThere were risks to this approach as well. Veins carry blood to the heart, meaning Cribier’s technique was going with the flow.\n\nThe arteries carry blood away the heart. It’s riskier to stick a catheter in there.\n\nEdwards decided to go against the flow.\n\nAnd it worked.\n\nClinical trials resumed. Patients on death’s door were revived and lived years longer.\n\nBy and large, the feared side effects never materialized. Many of those leading skeptics now use the TAVR procedure.\n\nAnd as Edwards continues to make improvements, the procedure is used to replace diseased aortic valves on younger and healthier patients.\n\nIn 2017, the number of TAVR procedures in the U.S. surpassed surgical aortic valve replacement among patients without other cardiac issues, according to Edwards.\n\n“It’s made a big impact,” said Dr. Aidan A. Raney, co-director of the Hoag Heart Valve Center and a past Hoag medical director of cardiovascular surgery. “It’s become quite a safe procedure. We’ve done about 500 of these procedures (at Hoag).”\n\nNow Edwards and other med-tech firms are trying to develop similar procedures for repairing or replacing the mitral and tricuspid heart valves.\n\nMussallem, meanwhile, continues to do community work outside Edwards.\n\nHe helped found OCTANe, an Orange County nonprofit that helps biomedical and technology startups find venture capital. He served on the UC Irvine Foundation and is helping form a new alliance of CEOs to address economic and social challenges facing Orange County.\n\nUpdate: The words “in the U.S.” were added to a paragraph saying TAVR procedures outnumbered surgical aortic valve replacements among patients without other cardiac issues in 2017.\n\n“He’s been extremely active in a very quiet way,” said Emile Haddad, CEO of FivePoint Communities, who worked with Mussallem on the board of the UCI Foundation.\n\n“You can measure Edwards’ contribution not just financially, but by the number of lives they have touched,” added Bill Carpou, OCTANe’s CEO. “You could say, not just the number of lives touched, but the number of lives saved.”"
