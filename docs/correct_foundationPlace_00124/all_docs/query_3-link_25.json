I was unable to take any pictures within the office itself, but instead got to take pictures of the main lobby and surrounding areas. Gabe was not around at the time of the tour and there was no mention or signs of HL3 (believe me, I asked).\n\nThe office part of Valve was really unique. Every employee (including Gaben) has a desk with wheels on the bottom, so they are allowed to simply roll their desk from meeting to meeting without giving up their beloved work stations. Valve does not have any management or \"executives\" in the company, so each employee must be extremely self sufficient.\n\nAt the end of the tour each person was given some valve swag which consisted of an HL2 sticker, companion cube patch, and a Dota 2 International lanyard. If anyone wishes to tour the email address for the front desk is: [email protected] and the address is: 10900 NE 4th Street, Floor 5, Bellevue, WA 98004.\n\nCheers!\n\nAttachments\n\n5.jpg\n\nIMG_20130627_152439.jpg\n\njoel.jpg\n\nvalve.jpg\n\nrewards.jpg\n\ngaben.jpg\n\ngame.jpg\n\nhl2.jpg\n\nmag.jpg\n\nsniper.jpg\n\nblaaa.jpg\n\nwrack.jpg\n\nOmnomnick\n\nRetired Lead Content Creator\n\nJoined\n\nMay 29, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n6,325\n\nReaction score\n\n1,125\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#2\n\nGlad to see you actually managed to visit like you had planned, you lucky dog you.\n\nShem\n\nThe Freeman\n\nJoined\n\nJul 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n2,011\n\nReaction score\n\n192\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#3\n\nIf I lived closer I'd definitely visit.

Really cool staff there, were quick and eager to show off the offices and got to playtest L4D with the dev team which was an awesome experience (although they didn't take my advice for weapons animations). They really do a great job to cater to fans that visit. Glad you got to experience it and it just keeps getting better there. They always add some new swag and toys around and about the offices and levels. I want that barnacle, you should have stole it!\n\nBad^Hat\n\nThe Freeman\n\nJoined\n\nMay 13, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n19,983\n\nReaction score\n\n530\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#5\n\nNeat pictures. I remember those PC mags, I think I have like 3 of them lying around somewhere. Probably the last time I actually bought any print mags, just so I could soak in as much HL2 info/screens as possible. Good times.\n\nLordGloppy\n\nSpy\n\nJoined\n\nJun 20, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n54\n\nReaction score\n\n13\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#6\n\nI visited them unannounced in 2009.

I though the IT dep was the coolest part of the tour (so many servers ). The barnacle was awesome but they only had one... you're right, I should have stolen it!\n\nLordGloppy\n\nSpy\n\nJoined\n\nJun 20, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n54\n\nReaction score\n\n13\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#7\n\nNeat pictures.

You have got to reach out to them it you are ever in the Seattle area.\n\ntrunk_slamchest\n\nParty Escort Bot\n\nJoined\n\nApr 26, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n203\n\nReaction score\n\n49\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#8\n\nhonestly, i wouldnt want to visit valve unless i was working there or if it was for a job interview. my end goal in life is to work for valve, so its kinda like how hockey players never touch the stanley cup until they actually win it. superstition i guess.\n\nother than that, their lobby looks snazzy. nice pics\n\nbobtheskull\n\nParty Escort Bot\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n417\n\nReaction score\n\n70\n\nJun 29, 2013\n\n#9\n\nJust shows what level of awesomeness Valve exists on. Can you imagine what would happen if you turned up at the doors of any other major games developer and asked if you could come in, never mind ask for a tour?!
