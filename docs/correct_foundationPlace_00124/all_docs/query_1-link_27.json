The reports also note that The Mount Sinai Hospital's program overall performs more valve surgery than any other in the state.\n\nDr. Adams also received the highest safety rating from the NYS Department of Health for cardiac surgery.\n\nOur recent paper in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology shows doctors with more experience provide patients better outcomes.\n\nOur current mitral valve repair rates of > 99% with < 0.5% mortality are national benchmarks. Long-term freedom from regurgitation and re-operations after valve repair are among the highest ever reported by the leading mitral centers in the world.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Hospital has received the Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center Award from the American Heart AssociationÂ® and the Mitral Foundation for its demonstrated record of superior clinical outcomes resulting from evidence-based, guideline-directed degenerative mitral valve repair.\n\nOver 2400 surgeons, of all levels of experience, have come to Mount Sinai to learn advanced reconstructive mitral valve repair techniques from Dr. Adams and his team in the Mitral Foundation Center. We regularly lead mitral valve repair workshops around the globe and, to date, have educated surgeons from over 60 countries.\n\nSchedule an Appointment\n\nReady to take the next step in your treatment or have any questions you'd like to ask us?
