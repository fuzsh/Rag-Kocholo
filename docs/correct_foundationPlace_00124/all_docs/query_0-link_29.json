        "text": "Traditional manual approaches to managing backfill systems are being replaced with improved and more efficient methods that are faster and safer. Automated diverter valves are among the technologies being used to effect efficiency and safety gains. Using diverter valves eliminates time-consuming manual operations that require special equipment and put workers in harmâ€™s way. A case study that assesses automated diverter valve operation and manual diversion at an Australian mine provides a comparison of functionality, time-savings, and safety advantages inherent to the diverter valve."
