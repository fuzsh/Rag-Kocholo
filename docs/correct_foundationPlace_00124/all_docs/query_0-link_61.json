        "text": "Barry Irwin founded Irwin IP in 2014 and has been litigating mission-critical, high-profile intellectual property and technology matters in federal courts across the country for over 30 years. Barry began his legal career at a prestigious boutique intellectual property law firm in Chicago. Three years later, he joined the Chicago office of the top AmLaw 100 law firm. There, he practiced intellectual property litigation for 18 years, the last 14 as a partner, and the last 10 as an equity partner.\n\nIn addition to his active litigation practice, Barry has been an Adjunct Professor at Notre Dame Law School since 2012, where he teaches Patent Litigation and Advanced Copyright Law/Entertainment Law. He has also served as an expert witness in intellectual property-related matters. He is the Board President of Lawyers for the Creative Arts, a former executive board member of the Linn Inn American Inn of Court, and Vice-Chair of the Burr Ridge Planning Commission.\n\nFurthermore, Barry has been lead counsel in over a dozen Patent Office review proceedings. For example, he successfully petitioned the PTAB to institute an IPR on a patent touted as the foundation for a billion dollar per year business despite that patent withstanding numerous other challenges brought by others, including prior Patent Office reviews and several federal court litigations. Finally, he often works with clients in strengthening their intellectual property portfolios to protect key products, including broadening existing intellectual property portfolios and securing rights to third party intellectual property.\n\nAwards, Honors, Distinctions\n\nBest Lawyers\n\nLawyer of the Year for Patent Litigation, Intellectual Property Litigation, Patent Law, Copyright Law (Chicago), 2024\n\nLawyer of the Year for Patent Litigation (Chicago), 2023\n\nLawyer of the Year for Copyright Litigation (Chicago), 2023\n\nBest Lawyer, 2019-present\n\nSuper Lawyers\n\nTop 100 Lawyers in Illinois, 2018\n\nIllinois Super Lawyer, 2005-present\n\nOrder of Veritas\n\nBarrister\n\nLeading Lawyers\n\nLeading Lawyer, 2004-present\n\nIntellectual Property Law\n\nMartindale-Hubbell\n\nPeer-Rated: AV Preeminent\n\nHighest Level of Professional Excellence\n\nLawyers for the Creative Arts\n\nDistinguished Service to the Arts, 2016\n\nLitigation Counsel of America\n\nLifetime Fellow\n\nRichard Linn American Inn of Court\n\nBoard Member, 2017-2020\n\nProfessional Accolades & Leadership Roles\n\nIn 2022 Barry was designated Lawyer of the Year by Best Lawyers in two separate areas: Patent Litigation and Copyright Law (each award given to a single lawyer in a community). In 2018, Barry was selected by Thomson Reuters as one of the Top 100 lawyers in Illinois. And, each year, for over 15 years, he has been named a Leading Lawyer and a Super Lawyer. He also received Martindale Hubbell’s highest ratings (AV, AV+ and AV Preeminent) in his first years of eligibility and each year thereafter.\n\nIn 2015, Barry received the rare distinction of being named a Fellow of the Litigation Counsel of America (LCA), and in 2022 became a Senior Fellow. LCA is an invitation-only honorary trial lawyer society composed of less than one-half of one percent of American lawyers. LCA Fellows are selected based on their legal excellence and accomplishments in litigation and superior ethical reputations. Barry has also been named an IP Star by Managing IP.\n\nIn 2016, Chicago-based Lawyers for the Creative Arts, a not-for-profit organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to members of the various Illinois arts communities, awarded him with its Distinguished Service to the Arts award. He has been a supervising attorney for numerous pro bono matters involving a broad range of issues and hundreds of attorney hours annually, including matters involving: the confinement conditions at a juvenile detention facility; employment discrimination; a trial of an aggravated assault charge resulting in acquittal; serving as guardian ad litem; and dozens of entertainment law matters.\n\nFor approximately 15 years, three times a year, Barry also taught trial advocacy to Kirkland & Ellis associates, participating in Kirkland’s multiday, immersive mock trial programs.\n\nNotable Cases & Results\n\nBarry is a first-chair litigation attorney handling high-stakes patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, restrictive covenant, unfair competition, false advertising, and antitrust matters.
