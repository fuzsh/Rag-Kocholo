        "text": "Product(s) in your cart may not be available in the selected country and will be removed from your cart if you choose the “SELECT” button below. Please contact us if you need assistance purchasing this product in another country.\n\nTwo Scotland-born brothers, Charles and Alexander Meston, see a tremendous business opportunity in developing a reliable electric motor. With the financial backing of John Wesley Emerson, a former Union army officer, judge and lawyer, they establish The Emerson Electric Manufacturing Company in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe fledgling company builds its business around AC motors and manufactures the first electric fans sold in North America. Under new president Herbert L. Parker, Emerson develops a reputation for quality products. Net sales total nearly $60,000.\n\nA design breakthrough upgrades Emerson Motors to a more useful ½ horsepower, which are then used to power countless time and effort-saving devices, such as washing machines and sewing machines.\n\nAt the World’s Fair in St. Louis, Emerson displays its product line in the dazzling Palace of Electricity as the nationwide demand for electricity continues to soar.\n\nUnder the leadership of Thomas Meston, the company expands into a new, eight-story factory building in St. Louis.\n\nJoseph Newman is named president and sets out to stabilize the company’s balance sheet. He moves the company to mass production of motors and adds a variety of fan lines to appeal to a broad range of consumers.\n\nWith fan sales stagnating, Stuart Symington takes over as president and wins a contract to build arc welders, thereby opening the door to sales at Sears.\n\nEmerson begins construction of a new plant in St. Louis to build hermetic motors, but World War II intervenes and the plant is shifted to the production of shell casings.\n\nUpon the sudden death of Oscar Schmitt, William Snead assumes the presidency of Emerson until new, long-term management can be secured.\n\nUnder Knight’s leadership, Emerson develops its best-cost producer strategy to meet the challenge of low-cost offshore competition. In the 1980s, Emerson moves into the international arena, investing abroad to meet customers’ needs in expanding markets."
