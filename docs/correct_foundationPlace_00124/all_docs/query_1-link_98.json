The company is known for the Half­Life, Counter­Strike, Portal, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, and Left 4 Dead series, Dota 2, and its software distribution platform Steam. Valve was founded in 1996 as a limited liability company by former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Their debut product, the PC first­person shooter Half­Life, was released in 1998 to critical acclaim and commercial success, after which Harrington left the company. In 2004, Valve launched Steam alongside the critically acclaimed Half­Life 2. By 2011, Steam controlled over half of the digital PC game market and Valve was the most profitable company per employee in the United States.[4] In 2015, Valve entered the game hardware market with the Steam Machine, a line of prebuilt gaming computers running SteamOS, a Valve­ developed fork of the Debian operating system.

Harrington left the company in 2000. After incorporation in April 2003,[7] it moved from its original location to Bellevue, Washington, the same city in which their original publisher, Sierra On­Line, Inc., was based. In 2010, the office was moved again to a larger location in Bellevue.[8] In 2016, Valve signed a nine­floor lease in the Lincoln Square complex in downtown Bellevue, doubling the size of their offices.[9] Half­Life After securing a license to the Quake engine through the help of friend Michael Abrash of id Software in late 1996, Newell and Harrington began working on Half­Life. Originally planned for release in late 1997, Half­Life launched on November 19, 1998. Valve acquired TF Software Pty. Ltd., the makers of the Team Fortress mod for Quake, in May 1998 with the intent to create a standalone Team Fortress game.[10] The Team Fortress Classic mod, essentially a port of the original Team Fortress mod for Quake, was released for Half­Life in 1999. Gearbox contributed much after the release of Half­Life. Gearbox Software is responsible for the Half­Life expansion packs, Half­Life: Opposing Force and Half­Life: Blue Shift, along with the home console versions of Half­Life for the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2 which included a third expansion pack called Half­Life: Decay, which enabled two­player split­screen co­op. Source game engine After the success of Half­Life, the team worked on mods, spin­offs, and sequels, including Half­Life 2. All current Valve games are built on its Source engine. The company has developed six game series: Half­Life, Team Fortress, Portal, Counter­Strike, Left 4 Dead and Day of Defeat. Valve is noted for its support of its games' modding community, most prominently, Counter­Strike, Team Fortress, and Day of Defeat. Valve has branched out with this tradition to continue developing Dota 2 as the standalone sequel to the Warcraft III mod.[11] Each of these games began as a third­party mod that Valve purchased and developed into a full game. They also distribute community mods on Steam.[12] Valve announced the Source 2 engine in March 2015, later porting the entirety of Dota 2 to the engine in September of that year.[13][14] Acquisitions and awards Valve has grown both in scope and commercial value. On January 10, 2008, Valve announced the acquisition of Turtle Rock Studios.[15] On April 8, 2010, Valve won The Escapist Magazine's March Mayhem tournament for the best developer of 2010,[16] beating out Zynga in the semi­finals and BioWare in the final."
