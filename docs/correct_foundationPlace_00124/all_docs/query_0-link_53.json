(“Keystone”) is pleased to announce it has launched Tribute Baking Company (“Tribute” or the “Company”), a market leading producer of authentic New York style kettle-boiled, hearth-baked bagels and specialty cake products sold into the in-store bakery, club store, foodservice, and convenience store channels. Tribute was formed through the combination of three family-owned wholesale bakeries: Always Bagels (“Always”), Original Bagel (“Original”), and Hometown Foods (“Hometown”).\n\nFor the last 25+ years, Always, Original, and Hometown have led the wholesale bagel market in quality. Together, Tribute employs more than 300 people and operates out of a collective 190K square feet across four SQF Level II facilities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Miami. The Company sells its product in a par-baked and fully baked frozen format to some of the most notable retailers and foodservice distributors on the East Coast, nationally, and internationally. The combined footprint of Tribute provides the advantage to its customers of four dedicated facilities, creating a resilient supply chain in the bagel category.\n\nAnthony Pariti, Co-Founder of Always, noted, “We are thrilled to begin our partnership with Keystone. We see tremendous opportunity to build on the strong foundation developed over the last several decades. Keystone’s differentiated approach of patiently investing alongside management with a focus on long-term value creation is a great fit for our employees and our customers.”\n\n“Partnering with Keystone and Always opens exciting opportunities for our collective businesses,” added Dave Harris and Bruce Levenbrook, President and CEO of Original, respectively. “Our combined decades of experience and legacy of quality are unparalleled in today’s marketplace. Additionally, Keystone’s deep understanding of the wholesale bakery business will provide us with an experienced strategic partner as we work together to achieve our goals for organic growth and complementary acquisitions.”\n\nThe formation of Tribute also represents a continuation of Keystone’s partnership with Hometown Foods, a multigenerational wholesale bakery based out of Miami. Hometown’s scaled manufacturing footprint brings substantial additional bagel manufacturing capacity and a portfolio of specialty cake products to the broader platform.\n\nKeystone’s bakery experience stretches back to the early 2000s through Keystone Bakeries Holdings (“KBH”), starting with a partnership with Freed’s Bakery, a market leader in fully finished cupcakes sold to the in-store bakery channel. Over the next decade, Keystone executed two transformative add-on acquisitions in the donut and cookie segment, driving significant growth prior to exiting the business to Weston Foods (TSX: WN) in 2010. Kevin McDonough, formerly the President of KBH, will lead Tribute going forward.\n\n“Keystone is excited to partner with these terrific family businesses to continue building on their legacy of quality and authenticity,” commented Chaoran Jin, Managing Director at Keystone Capital. “We see the same amount of opportunity in the wholesale bakery space that we saw 20 years ago and are eager to execute on our organic growth initiatives and targeted acquisitions.”\n\nTerms of the transaction are not being disclosed.

(\"Keystone\"), a Chicago-based private investment firm, is pleased to announce that its portfolio company Capsa Solutions, LLC (d/b/a Capsa Healthcare or “Capsa”) has been acquired by Levine Leichtman Capital Partners (“LLCP”). Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\n\nCapsa is a leading provider of mobile workstations, medication management products, and pharmacy automation solutions for healthcare settings worldwide. The Company’s workflow solutions improve efficiency and effectiveness for over 3,000 customers, including leading health systems, senior care communities, and major retail and institutional pharmacies. Capsa is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and has additional production facilities in Columbus, Ohio and Agua Prieta, Mexico.\n\n“Keystone’s success partnering with Capsa’s management team to build a market leading healthcare technology and equipment company is another terrific example of Keystone’s patient, long-term investment philosophy at work,” commented Scott Gwilliam, Managing Partner of Keystone Capital. “We wish the management team and Levine Leichtman the best with the business and are proud to have been partnered with Capsa for the past 17 years.”\n\nCapsa was the culmination of a 17-year investment horizon for Keystone, during which sales and EBITDA increased 13-fold through a combination of organic growth and add-on acquisitions. The business originally began with Keystone’s purchase of IRSG Holdings in 2000, followed by the acquisitions of MMI Med Carts (2008), Artromick International (2009), Kirby Lester (2014), and Rubbermaid Healthcare (2015). Capsa is led by CEO Andrew Sherrill and a talented management team across the business who will continue to lead Capsa moving forward.\n\n“The success we’ve experienced at Capsa would not have been possible without Keystone’s unwavering support of our team as we sought to build Capsa with an eye always towards our long-term goals,” remarked Sherrill. “The alignment of interest Keystone’s investment approach created with management made Keystone an ideal partner for us during this phase of our growth.”\n\nCapsa was represented by Harris Williams & Co. in the sale of the business. Legal advice was provided by Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Honigman Miller Schwartz & Cohn LLP.\n\nAbout Keystone Capital\n\nKeystone Capital is a private investment firm which operates with the goal of acquiring high quality, market-leading niche businesses and partnering with these businesses over a long-term horizon, where appropriate. Unlike a traditional private equity firm utilizing a fund-based investment model, Keystone utilizes the personal capital of its partners rather than outside third-party capital, capitalizes its investments with conservative capital structures, and engages actively in supporting the management teams of its portfolio companies. Keystone has completed over 25 platform investments in its history, supported by over 70 add-on acquisitions. Keystone’s primary offices are located in Chicago, Illinois.

(\"Keystone\") is pleased to announce that it has exited its investment in Atlas Die, LLC (“Atlas”) after 14 years of successful ownership. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\n\nAtlas is a manufacturer of steel rule and rotary dies for the packaging and folding carton industries. Headquartered in Elkhart, IN, Atlas began producing steel rule dies in 1952. Atlas pioneered the use of lasers in die production and has a broad product offering targeted at various converting industries, such as paperboard, labels, business forms, flexible circuits, greeting cards, and gaskets. Bernal, Inc. (“Bernal”), a subsidiary of Atlas, is a leader in the manufacture of engineered rotary dies for many of the same end markets and is based in Rochester Hills, MI.\n\nAtlas was originally acquired by Keystone and Atlas management in January 2003. During the course of the fourteen year investment horizon, Keystone led the acquisition of several strategic add-ons for Atlas, including Southeastern Die (2004) and Bernal (2013). “Atlas is a great example of Keystone’s long-term investment philosophy,” commented David Greer, Managing Director, Keystone Capital. \"We enjoyed our time with Ken Smott and the Atlas team, but we know that the business is well-positioned for the future under new ownership.”\n\nAtlas was acquired by Auxo Investment Partners, an operationally focused private investment firm based in Grand Rapids, MI. Livingstone Partners, a leading middle market investment bank, represented Atlas in the sale. “Keystone’s patient approach, and dedication to the long-term best interests of the business were invaluable to Atlas,” remarked Ken Smott, CEO of Atlas. “Their investment of personal capital made Keystone an ideal, patient partner for our business.”\n\nContact Information\n\nDavid A.

We acquired more businesses, deployed more capital and traveled more miles supporting our portfolio than at any time in our history. We are extremely proud of what we have accomplished and even more optimistic about our continued success in 2017. We could not have achieved these results without the great work of our staff, and with that we are excited to announce the following well-deserved promotions at Keystone: Chaoran Jin and Jason Van Zant have been promoted to Managing Director, and Dennis Howe and Bill Sommerschield have been promoted to Principal.\n\nChaoran Jin Promoted to Managing Director\n\nChaoran joined Keystone in 2009. Chaoran has been the lead professional supporting the operational and acquisition needs of our consumer products business, Costume Gallery, and most recently, our Asian foods platform, Nature Soy. She has also played an active role with Peak Technologies and Movilitas Consulting, and is the lead professional managing our activities and office in China. “Chaoran brings Keystone deep foundational insight into business strategy development. She has also created tangible value to our broader portfolio by driving our Asian sourcing and sales initiative,” commented David Greer, Managing Director at Keystone. Prior to Keystone, Chaoran worked for Owens Corning, McKinsey & Company, Citigroup and Motorola.\n\nJason Van Zant Promoted to Managing Director\n\nJason joined Keystone in 2008, and over his time at Keystone has closed 15 transactions for the firm. Jason is the primary lead professional on E4H, our health care architectural firm, and The Scott Group, our luxury goods business. “Jason has been a huge asset to our acquisition efforts over the years. He has significantly enhanced our marketing and new business development approach, and more recently brought the same energy to the overall support of some of our businesses”, commented Scott Gwilliam, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Keystone. Prior to Keystone, Jason worked for Lincoln International.\n\nDennis Howe Promoted to Principal\n\nDennis joined Keystone in 2013 and has had a significant impact on many of our portfolio companies, including Capsa Solutions, Avalon, Atlas Die and Rocore. From his days at Danaher as an executive, Dennis has a deep background in acquisition integration, operational efficiency and process change management. In addition to his time at Danaher, Dennis' previous experience includes working for The Boston Consulting Group on strategy assignments for industrial, financial and consumer goods clients and at BASF Corporation working as an Operations Manager and as a Product Development engineer.\n\nBill Sommerschield Promoted to Principal\n\nBill joined Keystone in 2014 and has played a key role with several of our more recent platform companies.

Prior to joining Keystone, Bill was a VP at Lake Capital, where he focused on the firm’s investment activities and served on the Board of Directors of Engine Group, ORC International, HMI, and Addison Group.\n\nThe last five years has been a particularly exciting time at Keystone Capital. We have significantly increased our level of acquisition activity with both new platforms and add-ons to our existing portfolio, and this increased activity has driven the need for even greater portfolio involvement. We could not have accomplished this without the tremendous dedication and effort of Chaoran, Jason, Dennis and Bill.\n\n“These team members are being recognized for their past contributions to the firm as well as their future potential,” commented Kent Dauten, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Keystone. “We thank them for their dedication and hard work and look forward to what they will accomplish in the coming years.”\n\nContact Information\n\nChaoran Jin\n\n(312) 219-7976\n\ncjin@keystonecapital.com\n\nJason Van Zant\n\n(312) 219-7974\n\njvanzant@keystonecapital.com\n\nDennis Howe\n\n(312) 219-7979\n\ndhowe@keystonecapital.com\n\nBill Sommerschield\n\n(312) 219-7973\n\nbsommerschield@keystonecapital.com\n\nhttps://keystonecapital.com/keystone-capital-is-pleased-to-announce-the-following-internal-promotions/\n\nKeystone Capital, Inc.
