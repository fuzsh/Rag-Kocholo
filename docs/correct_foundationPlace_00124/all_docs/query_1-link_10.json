        "text": "Ductile Iron Pipe\n\nMcWane's ductile iron pipe facilities make products that bring safe, clean water to homes and businesses. Corrosion resistant, for longevity in water and sewage systems, and machinable, for ease in field modifications, ductile iron pipe surpasses its competitors in terms of durability, strength and ductility and is lighter and more cost-effective than cast iron. Ductile iron maintains a maximum margin of safety against service failures and provides a durable and reliable solution for utility systems.\n\nPlumbing\n\nCast iron soil pipe made by McWane offers advantages such as strength, corrosion resistance and noise reduction that cannot be found in any other commercial piping. Cast iron pipes are also much quieter, muffling the noise from rushing wastewater more effectively than other options. Our pipe is strong enough to lie beneath building foundations and is resistant to expansion and contraction caused by extreme temperatures. Iron pipes also possess superior fire safety qualities: they cannot burn; unlike other products they do not produce toxic smoke in fires; and they can be passed safely through firewalls. With high ring crushing loads, iron pipes can be buried or encased in concrete for decades of trouble-free service.\n\nValve and Hydrant\n\nValves and Hydrants manufactured by McWane facilities are designed for promoting life and protecting lives and property in a variety of applications including private, municipal, industrial, wastewater, and fire protection. On-site Foundry and Finishing Facilities yield the majority of parts that are comprised in producing these vital water system components.\n\nWith a vast array of products and product options, the McWane Valve & Hydrant Group offers viable solutions for your waterworks needs.\n\nPressure Vessels\n\nManchester Tank offers a full line of pressure vessels, from D.O.T. propane cylinders and ASME tanks to hand-held torches, all provided in a wide range of sizes and shapes and all conforming to strict code requirements and safety standards.\n\nUtility Poles\n\nMcWane developed a new product for the electric utility industry, and that product is ductile iron utility poles. Using the extensive talents of our team members, we have become a reliable, quality supplier to the electric utility industry with our ductile iron distribution poles."
