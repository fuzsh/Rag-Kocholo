I have viewed this first campaign in the way I view episodic games. \"The Dead Man's Switch\" is basically one episode, not what one should call the entire purchase. The editor is extremely powerful, and given time many of the player made stories will offer a great deal of options tailored to various tastes. If you liked the core gameplay enough and even if you feel dissatisfied with your purchase, my suggestion is to stick it back on the virtual shelf for now, and see what the workshop/Berlin has to offer you in a few months time."
