        "text": "Background\n\nMitral regurgitation is the second most common type of heart valve disease in Europe and the most common type of heart valve insufficiency in the United States. Approximately 50,000 of these patients require surgical intervention each year in the United States. The incidence of mitral regurgitation is predicted to increase due to greater longevity with more degenerative and functional valve disease and patients with congestive heart failure.\n\nThe quest for a percutaneous approach is continuous despite the established feasibility, safety and results of conventional and minimally invasive surgical procedures. Emerging transcatheter techniques offer an alternative approach f patients considered high risk or contraindicated for conventional surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation has already showed established feasibility in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.\n\nTranscatheter procedures and conventional surgery alike offer techniques for mitral valve repair and percutaneous mitral valve replacement. Attempts to repair the valve have approached the problem via three distinct routes*:\n\nLeaflet repair\n\nAnnuloplasty : directly or indirectly via the coronary sinus\n\nVentricular modeling\n\n1. Leaflet repair\n\nThis approach attempts leaflet repair by a reproduction of the edge to edge repair initially described by Alfieri . The principle is to place a suture between the leaflets to create a double orifice mitral valve by co-apting the central leaflet scallops (figure 1). In the percutaneous procedure, a guide catheter is inserted from the right femoral vein into the left atrium through a trans-septal approach. A delivery system with a clip (MitraClip®, Evalve Inc., Menlo Park, USA) (figure 2) is steered through the mitral valve and positioned under echocardiographic and fluoroscopic control until a successful result as shown by diminished mitral regurgitation is obtained. A second clip can be placed if necessary. The MitraClip® has been evaluated with the Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair Study (EVEREST) I which demonstrated safety and feasibility. The ongoing EVEREST II trial compares the MitraClip device with standard surgical repair or replacement. Available results,4,5 report a 85% acute procedural success, defined as a successful clip implantation with core echocardiographic laboratory assessment of MR <2+ at discharge.\n\n2. Annuloplasty\n\nRemodeling of the mitral valve by surgical mitral annuloplasty is the current standard repair technique for functional mitral regurgitation. The procedure is based on the principle of correction of leaflet coaptation by decreasing the size of the annulus.\n\nIt has been performed with transcatheter techniques with devices introduced into the coronary sinus to reproduce the same effect; this has been termed“indirect annuloplasty”. It has been proposed mainly for patients with functional mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dilatation or ischaemic papillary muscle and posterior wall dysfunction for whom surgery is not a feasible option.\n\nSeveral devices are available, as the Viacor percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty (Viacor, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA), CARILLON mitral contour system (Cardiac Dimensions, Kirkland, Washington, USA) and MONARC percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty system (Edwards Lifesciences). The overall principal of these devices is based on a reshaping of the coronary sinus by shafts of different shapes and curves anchored proximally and distally in the coronary sinus (figure 3). Post deployment tension is applied to cinch the sinus and mitral annulus. Despite encouraging animal and preliminary human studies, there are several queries related to the real anatomical safety and applicability of this approach. Direct annuloplasty has been attempted with transcatheter techniques that emulate suture mitral annuloplasty surgery. The goal is to provide direct geometric reduction of the posterior annulus. Several systems are available such as the Mitralign Percutaneous Annuloplasty System (TM) (Mitralign, Inc. Tewksbury, MA, USA). The QuantumCor radio-frequency ablation system (QuantumCor, Lake Forest, CA, USA) attempts to reduce the annulus size of mitral valve annulus by application of radio-frequency.\n\n3. Ventricular modeling\n\nThe principle of these systems is to reduce mitral regurgitation by reducing the antero-posterior mitral annular diameter, re-approximating the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets and reducing functional mitral regurgitation. Technically speaking, they are not transcatheter devices but can be employed without the need for extracorporeal circulation. The Myocor iCoapsys (Myocor Inc., Maple Grove, MN) has been discontinued.\n\nFigure 1.
