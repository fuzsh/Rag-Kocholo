        "text": "The many benefits of natural gas make it an environmentally responsible energy choice for your home and appliances. Plus, if you use something other than natural gas to fuel your appliances, you can convert to natural gas and take advantage of our money-saving rebates!\n\nIf your wish list includes cooking on a gas range, cuddling by a natural gas fire or enjoying the comforts of gas heat and endless hot water, make sure you choose a property that features natural gas.\n\nAutomated meter reading is convenient and reliable. To read your natural gas meter, we will no longer need to go into your yard unless maintenance is required.\n\nWhenever a field service representative or one of our contractors visits your home or business, they will provide Atlanta Gas Light identification.\n\nBase charges represent our cost of delivering gas to your home or business, pipeline maintenance and meter reading. If you change marketers, this charge will remain the same.\n\nFind out where our gas is available for your business.\n\nNatural gas is American, abundant and affordable! It’s efficient, and the best energy choice for your family and the environment.\n\nHi, kids! I’m Sniffy. As a skunk, I’m an expert in stinky odors—like the “rotten egg” smell that’s added to natural gas. That yucky smell lets you know if there’s a possible natural gas leak.\n\nStay up to date and read the most recent and archived news releases, and more in our Press Room.\n\nAtlanta Gas Light employees are inextricably woven into the communities we are privileged to serve. We maintain local offices across our service territory, you might see our crews working in your neighborhood or find us at community events."
