        "text": "Our games attract millions\n\nand define genres.\n\nValve's debut title, Half-Life, was released in 1998. It won more than 50 game of the year awards, and PC Gamer even called it the Best PC Game Ever. Since then, we've released dozens of titles that changed the world. Today, millions of people play our games every day.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx\n\nDota Underlords\n\nCounter-Strike 2\n\nDota 2\n\nTeam Fortress 2\n\nOur earlier titles were built on an innovative engine with world-class gameplay as their paramount goal, and praised by critics as games that revitalized or even invented their genres.\n\nHalf-Life 2\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2\n\nPortal 2\n\nWe have some new games in the works, too. A couple have been announced, while others remain top secret.\n\nWe're just getting started.\n\nWe make all of this stuff collaboratively in Bellevue, Washington, where we combine the resources and talent of a world-class company with the ethos of a small startup. With an engaged and vocal community of partners and players, our products and our company will continue to change and grow in ways we may never have predicted. Join us, and help inform what's next."
