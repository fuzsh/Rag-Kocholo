        "text": "1. Valve Corporation Publishers Publishers are companies, which publishes video games that has been either developed by them or developed by other game development companies such as Valve, Bungie, and Treyarch etc. Valve Corporation’s main publisher is Vivendi S.A. (Originally named Vivendi Universal). Valve would of contacted Vivendi S.A. if they wanted any games published. But later on they ran into some legal issues between them two and Sierra Entertainment. Valve Corporation started there own in-house publisher called ‘Steam’ it started in September 12th 2013. One of the first games, which were released on ‘Steam’, was Half Life 1. CEO and Founders Gabe Logan Newell and Mike Harrington are the original creators of Valve Corporation. Gabe Logan Newell was working for Microsoft for about 13 years; after he had left Microsoft he described himself as a “producer of the first three releases of Windows.” Both Gabe Logan Newell and Mike Harrington were late employees at Microsoft. After Gabe Logan Newell and Mike Harrington both left windows they started a company called Valve in 1996. Then they used their own money to fund the company to make sure they develop a game called Half-life. In 2000, Mike Harrington left Valve Corporation to go on an extended vacation with his wife. Project Director / Manager / Producer Valve Corporation doesn’t have a project director, manager and producer. This is being Valve Corporation likes to give freedom to its employees, for example if you wanted to work on Half-Life 3, you would have to move to a different location in the building so you could work on it. Valve Corporation has a very good idea on letting everyone do whatever he or she want due to the fact that it lets people be more creative. So Valve Corporation doesn’t have a project director, manager or a producer. Programmers Valve Corporation has many programmers that work on different projects. The programmer’s job is to make sure it develops the engineering behind all of the games, for example they would have to program all of the moves a character would have to do. Programmers are very important in creating a\n\n2. game due to the fact that they are the brains behind all of the development of the game. Artists Artists are very important in Valve Corporation, because sketch out ideas to make sure everything looks perfect for the game. They also help all of the game designers to make sure they get the perfect image in their head. Valve Corporation is known for having beautiful games due to the fact they have very good artists to sketch out how the game looks like. It’s very important to have artists working for your company because they design all of the basics within the game, which helps the game designer produce the final product. Designers Valve Corporation has a wide range of designers, who work on many different games. They are very important because they design all of the game for the final product. They are the ones who are going to use programs like SDK and SFM. They design all of the levels of the game as well as designing the characters for the game.\n\n3.

Wood\n\n4. Platform Technology Valve Corporation produces games for PC, PlayStation and Xbox. They are currently working on there own machine called ‘Steam Machine.’ They have released games for all of these consoles due to the fact that they want a wide range of audience. With the new eighth generation consoles coming out, it gives Valve’s developers a big benefit on what they can create due to the fact that the new generation consoles are better and faster. For example the new PlayStation 4 has a much faster processor, better graphics as well as more ram. Valve Corporation mainly focuses on PC games due to the fact that you can be more creative on making PC games because PC is more evolved than consoles like PS3, Xbox one etc. Valve Corporation is a very creative company who have came out with games like Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, and Portal etc. Valve hasn’t created anything for the new consoles such as PlayStation 4, Xbox one etc. Game Types One of the most famous games Valve has made is the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Source is a first-person shooter, which became very popular quickly. Valve Corporation makes a wide range of different game types such as MOBA’s, First-Person Shooters, Puzzle, Survival horrors etc. So we see that Valve Corporation likes to make games, which have different game types, because they probably like to make loads of different games to make sure the audience likes any of the games that get released by them. Valve Corporation isn’t like Rockstar (A different company that develops games). Rockstar is mainly known for making open-world adventure games, which means they mostly make open world games. Games on multi-platforms Valve Corporation has released many games on a wide range of consoles like PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows etc. Valve Corporation mostly focuses on PC games. There are many different companies that only produce games, which are exclusive for certain consoles for example Halo is exclusive to Microsoft. Regulatory Bodies There have been many problems with games having disturbing content shown in them, which could lead into the game getting banned. Throughout Valve’s history there hasn’t been that many problems with them before, due to the fact that Valve gets their games ranked as being ‘Mature’. The ‘Mature’ rating doesn’t really mean that younger audiences cant play their games because\n\n5. there isn’t that much disturbing violence within the game. Games like Counter-Strike, Half-life etc. help people increase on certain skills while actually playing the game, for example if people play loads of Counter-Strike they might increase their reflexes. Even though, Valve haven’t had much problems before, the problems that they have had were that they got a game banned from countries such as Australia and Germany due to the fact that they wouldn’t accept the classification of the game due to the amount of violence and blood in the game which is ‘Left 4 Dead 2’. Later on, Valve changed the game around to make sure that they get unbanned from those countries, they done this by actually making the enemies disappear and then a very little amount of blood coming out of them to make sure it doesn’t disturb the audience that is actually playing it. PEGI is a company, which covers all of the age rating of games, for example we see that FIFA 16 has a PEGI sign at the bottom left to inform the audience that the age rating of the film is 3 due to the fact that it doesn’t have any violence, swearing etc. In this picture we see that PEGI has also added different features what the game might include, for example GTAV would have violence so it should have a violence sign on the back of the game to make sure that the audience understands that it has violence in it. The BBFC controls all the age rating of films, this isn’t very different to PEGI, and the only different thing is that BBFC covers films whereas PEGI covers the games age ratings. Development software Valve corporation uses many different development software, they have created there own company called ‘Source’ which does all of the character animation, advanced AI, real-world physics, shader-based rendering, and super extensibility. This company that they have created has helped them make loads of games look more good-looking also it has been considered the most flexible, comprehensive, and powerful game development environment out there. Source SDK is software, which is very good to development games on, there have been many games developed such as, Half-life, Half-life 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Using source is very important for Valve corporation because they will have the best software out there to make sure that all of there games look amazing."
