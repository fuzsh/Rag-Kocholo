After several restarts and lots of trial and error I've finally been having a nice playthrough that seems to be going slowly but well. I just unlocked taverns and was curious about a couple of things.\n\nI was thinking about having a tavern lower into my village, near the homes but also thinking of having one further out along the route travelers come in from if for nothing else then to have the aesthetic of a travelers inn. Is this something that is logical or should I avoid doing that? I also noticed I can build a several berry brewery and was wondering about the feasibility of building the tavern in one spot with the lounge and counter and then building the brewery as it's own separate building in a different spot. Is that an option that would work?"
