Working together with a local executive architect, JPC Architects, the Design Team at Clive Wilkinson Architects implemented a dynamic design solution for the popular American video game developer that incorporates flexible, open workspace for the software and hardware departments with a cafeteria, café spaces, gym and shower facilities, audio suites, a merchandise display room, a motion capture room and a family playroom. Building from Valve’s deep-rooted cabal system of self-organised, multidisciplinary project teams, the new workplace is supported by a flexible and interactive floor plan with a variety dedicated meeting spaces and semi-enclosed work pods that provide additional privacy for ‘heads-down’ work. Connecting feature stairs provide a direct route from the hardware cabals on the lowest floor to the software cabals at the highest."
