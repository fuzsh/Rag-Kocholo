Local expertise.\n\nCore & Main is a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, and related services, built on the foundation of more than 100 legacy companies. Operating more than 350 branches nationwide, we combine local expertise with a national supply chain to provide contractors and municipalities innovative solutions for new construction and aging infrastructure. Core & Main's nearly 5,500 associates are committed to helping their communities thrive with safe and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nWhat's in a Name? Why Are We Called Core & Main?\n\nWhen we formed our company, we went to our best resource, our associates, to find a name for our organization. Associate Quinton Carter's submission spoke to our DNA. As he explains it, \"Core comes from our core values, and main not just for main water lines, but for being the main supplier - people want to come to us rather than our competitors.\" We serve our communities, so where we live is at the corner of Core & Main."
