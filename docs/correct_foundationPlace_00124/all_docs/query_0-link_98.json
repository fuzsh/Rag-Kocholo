        "text": "Subsequent to moving my first house, in 2007 I met up with Jeremy Nickel, one of the family members representing Nickel Bros, a family-owned house moving company founded Port Coquitlam, BC in 1956.\n\nI joined Nickel Bros, ultimately helping to set up the US office (near Everett, WA) and serving in various capacities over the years; including marketing, PR, government relations, estimating, and “House Rescue” as moved-house salesperson. During my tenure, I helped save over 100 houses that would have otherwise been demolished—typically to make way for new construction.\n\nWhy do I say I “joined the circus?”\n\nI quickly realized that Nickel Bros is to house moving like the ‘Flying Wallendas’ are to the circus trapeze.\n\nThe Nickel Bros are a family of self-taught, life-long experts at the highly complex, technical, and potentially dangerous art of preparing, supporting, lifting, and moving houses of all shapes and sizes. Typically a house moving families pass down their knowledge and invented techniques from their fathers and uncles to their sons, nephews, daughters, and nieces over many, many decades. Their understanding of real-world structural engineering is unmatched.\n\nThe Nickel Bros have moved everything from small Craftsman Bungalows to 200-ton brick mansions!\n\nLike a circus family, they tend to be somewhat nomadic, traveling to all corners of the country or region where they ‘perform’ their art.\n\nDuring my ten years with Nickel Bros, I too had to learn by doing. Since Nickel Bros moves or lifts up to about 300 houses per year, each job is unique, complex, and challenging. As the careful and exhaustive preparation and permitting is being done, creative problem-solving often has to occur on the fly. Like the Wallendas, safety and discipline is key. A house move is conducted with military-like precision, each crew member assigned to a task; each assigned to a corner of the house during a move, and each watching each other’s back. With all of the complex work that goes into bringing a house move to fruition, it is very much a ‘high-wire act’ to save each and every house!\n\nAt the stroke of midnight, the tractor engine is revved up for the move, and the house is slowly pulled off of the site and onto the right-of-way for its journey down the road. Moves typically take about four to six hours — especially if there are overhead utilities that have to be lifted over the house or onto the street for the house to cross over. However, in the case of the Stone Cottage, this move may go much more quickly (likely an hour or less). The house will travel at about walking speed, but could go faster if needed.\n\nNote: During some more complex moves, it is actually possible to tip the building as much as 15° to get over bridge railings, mailboxes, and other obstacles along the route (though that won’t be needed in this case). Also, the rear dollies (axels) can be turned in the opposite direction from the tractor—much like an articulating firetruck—in order to navigate complex intersections and tight turns. Also, a back-and-forth approach can be used to go around tight intersections, traffic light arms, and other obstacles.\n\nOnce the procession reaches its destination and the house is maneuvered into place (in this case for storage), the crew locks down all of the equipment and leaves the site for some much-needed rest (and a hearty breakfast). Typically, the house movers come back a day or two later to remove the tractor, dolly equipment, and bunk, and go through a ‘reverse’ process to lift and place cribbing in four locations under the main beams like before, using the hydraulic jacks to lower the house onto the cribbing like before.\n\nNote: Houses can be securely stored indefinitely once they are placed into storage. In many cases (if they are at their final destination), they are left on cribbing while foundation forms are built directly below the outside rim of the house. In fact, the house can act as a ‘template’ for the foundation by dropping plumb lines to the foundation corners, allowing for a perfect fit (even if the house is not perfectly ‘square’). Once the forms are built, inspected, and approved, the concrete is poured, and the house can be lowered onto the new foundation within about 7 to 10 days, and bolted down securely for another 100-years of life!"
