This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent, which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required herein.\n\n(d) Severability.

The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the department files.\n\n(b) Alternative Materials, Design and Methods of Construction and Equipment. The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code; provided, that any such alternative has been approved. An alternative material, design or method of construction shall be approved where the code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, not less than the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. Where the alternative material, design or method of construction is not approved, the code official shall respond in writing, stating the reasons why the alternative was not approved.\n\n(c) Required Testing. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this code or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the code official shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense to the jurisdiction.\n\n(1) Test Methods.

When a structure or equipment is found by the code official to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy, or is found unlawful, the code official is authorized to condemn such structure pursuant to the provisions of this code.\n\n(1) Unsafe Structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation that partial or complete collapse is possible.\n\n(2) Unsafe Equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or structure.\n\n(3) Structure Unfit for Human Occupancy. A structure is unfit for human occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin- or rat-infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public.\n\n(4) Unlawful Structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or that was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.\n\n(5) Dangerous Structure or Premises. For the purpose of this code, any structure or premises that has any or all of the conditions or defects described below shall be considered dangerous:\n\n(A) Any door, aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress that does not conform to the approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction as related to the requirements for existing buildings.\n\n(B) The walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress is so warped, worn loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to not provide safe and adequate means of egress.\n\n(C) Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism or by any other cause to such an extent that it is likely to partially or completely collapse, or to become detached or dislodged.\n\n(D) Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation on the exterior thereof, that is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place, so as to be capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one-half times the original designed value.\n\n(E) The building or structure, or part of the building or structure, because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for any other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fail or give way.\n\n(F) The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly unsafe for its use and occupancy.\n\n(G) The building or structure is neglected, damaged, dilapidated, unsecured or abandoned so as to become an attractive nuisance to children who might play in the building or structure to their danger, becomes a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral persons, or enables persons to resort to the building or structure for committing a nuisance or an unlawful act.\n\n(H) Any building or structure that has been constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an extent as to present either a substantial risk of fire or building collapse or any other threat to life and safety.\n\n(I) A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by the code official to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease.\n\n(J) Any building or structure, because of a lack of sufficient or proper fire-resistance-rated construction, fire protection systems, electrical system, fuel connections, mechanical system, plumbing system or other cause, is determined by the code official to be a threat to life or health.\n\n(K) Any portion of a building remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned so as to constitute such building or portion thereof as an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public.\n\n(6) Drug Properties and Structures. It is hereby declared that any building, structure and/or associated property wherein or upon which the manufacture, distribution, production or storage of illegal drugs or the precursors to create illegal drugs has taken place in a manner which could endanger the public, such building, structure and/or associated property is not only a dangerous property but is also of a classification of property calling for the special procedures set forth in this section. The code official is authorized to abate such dangerous buildings, structures and/or associated properties in accordance with the dangerous building procedures set forth in such code, with the following modifications:\n\n(A) Due to public safety hazard in drug-production facilities, the utilities shall be disconnected;\n\n(B) Building(s) and structures will be inspected to determine compliance with all city ordinances and codes;\n\n(C) Building(s) and any entry gates to the property will be secured against entry.\n\nNo reconnection of utilities or re-occupancy of the building(s), structures or property shall be allowed until all violations have been remedied and all dangerous conditions abated to the satisfaction of the code official and a notice of release for re-occupancy has been received from the health department.\n\n(b) Closing of Vacant Structures. If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the code official is authorized to post a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner or owner’s authorized agent to close up the premises within the time specified in the order, the code official shall cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected by any other legal resource.\n\n(1) Authority to Disconnect Service Utilities. The code official shall have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated by this code and the referenced codes and standards set forth in Section 21.41.102(g) in case of emergency when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property or when such utility connection has been made without approval. The code official shall notify the serving utility and, whenever possible, the owner or owner’s authorized agent and occupant of the building, structure or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnection the owner, owner’s authorized agent or occupant of the building, structure or service system shall be notified in writing as soon as practical thereafter.\n\n(2) Standards for Securing Buildings. To secure a building, all doors, window openings, or other openings on floors accessible from grade shall be closed and locked, or shuttered to prevent third party entry. If openings are damaged so they cannot be secured using normal building amenities, they shall be secured by covering with seven-sixteenths-inch minimum thickness structural panel cut to fit over the building opening and secured with No. 10 wood screws with fender washers. The screws shall penetrate the wood framing by a minimum of one and one-quarter inches and the screws shall be spaced around the perimeter of the opening at no less than twelve inches on center.\n\n(c) Notice. Whenever the code official has condemned a structure or equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice and served on the owner, owner’s authorized agent or the person or persons responsible for the structure or equipment in accordance with Section 21.41.107(c). If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the condemned equipment. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section 21.41.107(b).\n\n(d) Placarding. Upon failure of the owner, owner’s authorized agent or person responsible to comply with the notice provisions within the time given, the code official is authorized to post on the premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the word “Condemned” and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard.\n\n(1) Placard Removal. The code official shall remove the condemnation placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the code official shall be subject to the penalties provided by this code.\n\n(e) Prohibited Occupancy. Any occupied structure condemned and placarded by the code official shall be vacated as ordered by the code official. Any person who shall occupy a placarded premises or shall operate placarded equipment, and any owner, owner’s authorized agent or person responsible for the premises who shall let anyone occupy a placarded premises or operate placarded equipment, shall be liable for the penalties provided by this code.\n\n(f) Abatement Methods. The owner, owner’s authorized agent, operator or occupant of a building, premises or equipment deemed unsafe by the code official shall abate or cause to be abated or corrected such unsafe conditions, either by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or other approved corrective action.\n\n(g) Record. The code official shall have authority to cause a report to be filed on an unsafe condition. The report shall state the occupancy of the structure and the nature of the unsafe condition. (Ord. 4651 § 3, 2018; Ord. 4524 § 81, 2016: Ord. 4282 § 1 (Att. A) (part), 2011)\n\n21.41.109 Emergency measures.\n\n(a) Imminent Danger. When, in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure that endangers life, or when any structure or part of a structure has fallen and life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the proximity of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the code official is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The code official is authorized to cause to be posted at each entrance to such structure a notice reading as follows: “This Structure Is Unsafe and Its Occupancy Has Been Prohibited by the Code Official.” It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure except for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs, removing the hazardous condition or of demolishing the same.\n\n(b) Temporary Safeguards. Notwithstanding other provisions of this code, whenever, in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent danger due to an unsafe condition, the code official is authorized to order the necessary work to be done, including the boarding up of openings, to render such structure temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the code official deems necessary to meet such emergency.\n\n(c) Closing Streets. When necessary for public safety, the code official is authorized to temporarily close structures and close, or order the authority having jurisdiction to close, sidewalks, streets, public ways and places adjacent to unsafe structures, and prohibit the same from being utilized.\n\n(d) Emergency Repairs. For the purposes of this section, the code official is authorized to employ the necessary labor and materials to perform the required work as expeditiously as possible.\n\n(e) Costs of Emergency Repairs. Costs incurred in the performance of emergency work shall be paid by the jurisdiction. The legal counsel of the jurisdiction is authorized to institute appropriate action against the owner of the premises or owner’s authorized agent where the unsafe structure is or was located for the recovery of such costs.\n\n(f) Hearing. Any person ordered to take emergency measures shall comply with such order forthwith. Any affected person shall thereafter, upon petition directed to the hearing examiner, be afforded a hearing as set forth in Chapter 1.12. (Ord. 4524 § 82, 2016: Ord. 4282 § 1 (Att.
