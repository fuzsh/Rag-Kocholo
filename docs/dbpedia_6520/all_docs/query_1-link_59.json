        "text": "SUFFERN – A New York City company is looking to purchase the former Novartis campus with plans to redevelop the property for warehousing and commercial space.\n\nMayor Michael Curley, elected in November, said representatives of Brookfield Properties pitched their plan to purchase the 167-acre campus and described plans for redevelopment.\n\nCurley didn't know the potential sales price, though the plan could bring in significant property taxes and jobs. He said he got the impression the sale could be finalized by July.\n\nJustin Davenport, a Brookfield vice president and one of the company officials who spoke with Curley, did not return telephone messages seeking comment and details of the company's plan.\n\nTax reduction sought: Novartis site owners give up bid for lower tax bill as Ramapo, Suffern prevail\n\nSuffern: Novartis site sold for $18 million, resold for $30 million\n\nSale stalled: Novartis property sales clouded by legal claims\n\nThe property straddling the Suffern and Montebello border on Old Mill Road includes a 585,000-square-foot building with offices, laboratories, a manufacturing area and a warehouse. The parcel had been Suffern's largest taxpayer, paying $310,259 for the 2018-2019 fiscal year.\n\nTangled history\n\nThe financial dealings involving the property have been ongoing since the pharmaceutical giant sold the manufacturing plant in September 2017. There's been a federal bankruptcy case and legal haggling between the various owners.\n\nNovartis sold the campus for $18 million to the Monsey-based RS Old Mill LLC in 2017. Old Mill at the time had been seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to keep from forfeiting its $2.5 million deposit.\n\nOld Mill then flipped the property for $30 million to a Manhattan-based development company, Suffern Partners LLC. In 2020, the property was sold for $55 million – some $14 million higher than the market value of about $41 million, according to the Ramapo town assessor.\n\nPrior to the 2020 sale, Suffern Partners sought a tax reduction on the property that would have reduced the assessed value from $41 million to $6 million. By ending the case and conceding the value of the parcels, the owners spared taxpayers a potential $1.36 million loss in tax revenue and a resulting property tax increase, officials said.\n\nCreating jobs, revenue\n\nCurley said the Brookfield Properties proposal would generate property taxes and jobs, which could generate revenue for local businesses.\n\n\"Brookfield Properties is proposing a project of over one million square feet of commercial space,\" Curley said. \"The Suffern Village board will review this project to make sure it is a good fit for our community.\"\n\nAn email from Brookfield Vice President Justin Davenport to Curley stated \"this project should generate approximately 1,650 permanent jobs.\n\n\"While under construction, we would anticipate 250-300 people performing work on the project site,\" Davenport wrote. \"This does not account for all the other jobs behind the scenes (truck drivers, crews in shops fabricating, etc.) which could be another 150 people.\"\n\nBrookfield has properties across the country, including Mahwah, New Jersey, according to the company's website. The company boasts of properties in Great Britain and Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhat comes next\n\nCurley said Brookfield's plan calls for taking down the older buildings and developing a 900-square-foot facility and two smaller buildings. He said the redeveloped property will involve trucks so concerns include the safety of residents and school children.\n\n\"They wouldn't need a zone change and seem ready to go with their plans,\" Curley said.\n\nHe said the village would hold public hearings to get the views of residents and the Planning Board would review the project. The company might need variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals, he said.\n\nCurley said the company may seek a tax break under a PILOT, or Payment in Lieu of Taxes, agreement.\n\n\"The people of Suffern would be hurt the most,\" he said."
