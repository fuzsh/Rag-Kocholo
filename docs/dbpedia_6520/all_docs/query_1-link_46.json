The companies gave $50,000 each.\n\nThe donations were examined as part of federal and state investigations into Mr. de Blasio’s fund-raising practices. Those inquiries ended with no criminal charges filed against the mayor, who is now a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nBut the donations and the mayor’s fund-raising practices are also the basis of an inquiry by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a state body that on Thursday announced that it had reached settlements with the three developers for potential violations of New York’s Lobbying Act.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
