        "text": "City in Middlesex County, New Jersey, US\n\nCity in New Jersey, United States\n\nSouth Amboy is a suburban city in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located on Raritan Bay. As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 9,411,[10][11] an increase of 780 (+9.0%) from the 2010 census count of 8,631,[19][20] which in turn reflected an increase of 718 (+9.1%) from the 7,913 counted in the 2000 census.[21]\n\nSouth Amboy and Perth Amboy, across the Raritan River, are collectively referred to as The Amboys. Signage for exit 11 on the New Jersey Turnpike refers to \"The Amboys\" as a destination.[22][23]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst settled by the Lenape Native Americans, who called the area around Perth Amboy by the name \"Ompoge\" (meaning \"level ground\"), the settlement ultimately became a key port for commerce between Lower New York Bay and Philadelphia, connected first by stagecoach and eventually by railroad.[24][25] The city was initially founded as a village by Dutch fishermen known as Radford's Ferry, but later become a key city to safeguard New Amsterdam from the British.[26] When settled by Europeans in 1684, the city was named New Perth in honor of James Drummond, Earl of Perth, one of the associates of a company of Scottish proprietaries. The Algonquian language name was corrupted to Ambo, or Point Amboy, and eventually a combination of the native and colonial names was used.[27][28][29] South Amboy is mentioned during the Revolutionary War in letters to and from George Washington referring to an \"officer stationed on the South Amboy shore\" and by General Washington himself writing that he was \"now in Jersey\" and suggesting the enemy \"may proceed to South Amboy\". Once known as Radford's Ferry, as well as the South Ward of Perth Amboy, South Amboy became one of the earliest townships around 1685 as well as one of the largest at 18 miles long and six miles wide.[30]\n\nIn 1808, the first store was opened by Samuel Gordon. In 1831, Robert L. Stevens brought the steam engine \"John Bull\" to the Camden & Amboy Railroad. In 1832, Charles Moore became the town's first lawyer. In 1844, the first post office was established in the town. In 1852, the Swan Hill Pottery was established. Most of the town's churches were established between the 1850s-1880s. In 1880, the Great Beds Lighthouse is built offshore. In 1882, local newspaper \"The Citizen\" was established. In 1888, Amboy National Bank was established. In 1889, the oldest active fraternal organization, the Knights of Pythias Lodge was established. In 1890, a huge fire destroyed an entire city block of wooden houses on the east side of Broadway, which led to the establishment of the city's first fire station that same year. In 1912, the Woman's Club was formed. In 1912, New Jersey's first air mail flight was made between South Amboy and Perth Amboy. In 1914, the South Amboy Public Library was established. In 1919, the first public high school was established. In 1924, the South Amboy Hospital was built. In 1927, the Victory Bridge was built, connecting South Amboy to Perth Amboy. In 1931, the South Amboy First Aid Squad was established. In 1972, the library was rededicated as Sadie Pope Dowdell Public Library. In 1984, scenes for The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) were filmed in South Amboy at the Raritan Diner.[31] In 1991, the South Amboy-Sayreville Times newspaper was established. In 1993, the Amboy Beacon newspaper was established. Raritan Bay Waterfront Park opened in 1998. In 1999, filming for Coyote Ugly (2000) took place in South Amboy, where the film partially is set.[31] In 2002, the South Amboy Neighborhood Preservation Program started. In 2002, the Seastreak Ferry service began. In 2004, South Amboy joined the New Jersey Main Street Program. In 2010, the YMCA and senior center opened.[26]\n\nSouth Amboy has passed through three of the five types of New Jersey municipalities. It was first mentioned on May 28, 1782, in minutes of the Board of Chosen Freeholders as having been formed from Perth Amboy Township. It was formally incorporated as a township by the Township Act of 1798 on February 21, 1798. Over the next 90 years, portions split off to form Monroe Township (April 9, 1838), Madison Township (March 2, 1869; later renamed as Old Bridge Township) and Sayreville Township (April 6, 1876; later Borough of Sayreville). Other modern municipalities included in these splits are Jamesburg, South Brunswick, and Cranbury.[30] As of February 25, 1888, South Amboy borough was formed, replacing South Amboy Township. On April 11, 1908, South Amboy was incorporated as a city, replacing South Amboy borough, confirmed by a referendum held on July 21, 1908.[32][33]\n\nAmmunition explosions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a result of South Amboy's strategic location as a transportation hub, the city has been heavily damaged by military explosives in two major incidents. The 1918 explosions occurred during World War I at the Gillespie Shell Loading Plant, just south of the town. The 1950 explosion struck as Healing Lighterage Company dockworkers were transferring ammunition from a freight train onto barges. Both disasters killed dozens and injured hundreds of local victims, damaged hundreds of South Amboy buildings, required emergency declarations of martial law, and scattered wide areas of ammunition remnants that continue to surface occasionally.[34][35][36][37][38][39]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 2.68 square miles (6.95 km2), including 1.54 square miles (3.98 km2) of land and 1.15 square miles (2.97 km2) of water (42.76%).[8][40] South Amboy is bordered by land with Sayreville to the south and west, by Perth Amboy to the north (across the Raritan River), and Staten Island to the east (across the Raritan Bay in New York City).[41][42][43]\n\nArea codes 732 and 848 are used in South Amboy.[15] The city had been in area code 908, until January 1, 1997, when 908 was split forming area code 732. South Amboy has an enclave of apartments near Kohl's in Sayreville, whose residents use a South Amboy mailing address. The Melrose and Morgan sections of Sayreville and the Laurence Harbor section of Old Bridge also use the South Amboy Zip Code of 08879. [citation needed] Mechanicsville, White's Dock, and Thomas J. Dohany Homes are neighborhoods in the city.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs The New York Times said of South Amboy in 2000: \"The population mix has not changed much since the beginning of the 20th century, when Irish and Polish immigrants came to work on the three railroads that crisscrossed the city.\"[44] South Amboy remains a strong enclave of Polish ethnicity, including 21% of its population in the 2000 census,[45] and the historic Sacred Heart Church and School.[46]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 17902,626—18103,071—18203,40610.9%18303,78211.0%18401,825*−51.7%18502,26624.2%18603,65261.2%18704,525*23.9%18803,648*−19.4%18904,33018.7%19006,34946.6%19107,00710.4%19207,89712.7%19308,4767.3%19407,802−8.0%19508,4227.9%19608,4220.0%19709,33810.9%19808,322−10.9%19907,863−5.5%20007,9130.6%20108,6319.1%20209,4119.0%2023 (est.)10,237[10][12]8.8%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 8,631 people, 3,372 households, and 2,256 families in the city.

The city is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form.[59] The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member City Council. The mayor is elected directly by the voters. The City Council includes five members, two of whom are elected on an at-large basis while three are elected from wards. All members of the governing body are elected in partisan elections to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis in even-numbered years as part of the November general election, with the three ward seats up for election together and the two at-large seats and the mayoral seat up for vote together two years later.[6][60]\n\nAs of 2024 , the Mayor of South Amboy is Democrat Fred Henry, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026.[2] Members of the City Council are Council President Michael \"Mickey\" Gross (D, 2026; at-large), Anthony Conrad (D, 2026; at-large), Zusette Dato (D, 2024; Third Ward), Brian H. McLaughlin (D, 2024; First Ward) and Thomas B. Reilly (D, 2024; Second Ward).[61][62][63][64]\n\nIn February 2015, the City Council appointed Thomas Reilly to fill the Second Ward expiring in December 2016 that became vacant when Christine Noble took office in an at-large seat.[65] In the 2015 November general election, Reilly was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.[66]\n\nFollowing the death of Russell Stillwagon in June 2010, after serving nearly two decades on the City Council, Donald Applegate was chosen the following month by council members from among three names proposed to fill the vacancy representing the First Ward.[67]\n\nFederal, state and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Amboy is located in the 6th Congressional District[68] and is part of New Jersey's 19th state legislative district.[69][70][71]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 6th congressional district is represented by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[72][73] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[74] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[75][76]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 19th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Joe F. Vitale (D, Woodbridge Township) and in the General Assembly by Craig Coughlin (D, Woodbridge Township) and Yvonne Lopez (D, Perth Amboy).[77]\n\nMiddlesex County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners, whose seven members are elected at-large on a partisan basis to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting held in January, the board selects from among its members a commissioner director and deputy director.[78] As of 2024 , Middlesex County's Commissioners (with party affiliation, term-end year, and residence listed in parentheses) are:\n\nDirector Ronald G.
