The area still holds evidence today of the historic attempt by immigrant workers to build a spur line over four miles of rugged terrain with continual elevation challenges. Construction was started in 1886 with $100,000 worth of capital stock funded to a local charter company. The workers nearly completed the grade for the spur line before financial hardship doomed the project's completion without a single rail ever being laid. Even today, much of the original rail bed is still evident throughout parts of the state forest.\n\nNearby State Lands, Facilities, Amenities and Other Information\n\nState Lands and Facilities\n\nCharles E.
