During his tenure, he restructured operations at Borough Hall and served as senior advisor to the Borough President. He focused on driving the borough’s economic development agenda, working closely with the Mayor’s Office, City Council, and Economic Development Corporation (EDC), and served on the Boards of EDC, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation and Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nA graduate of both Pace University and Pace Law School, Carlo owned a thriving solo practice law firm in Dyker Heights prior to joining the Borough President’s Office.
