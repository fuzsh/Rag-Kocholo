        "text": "Regional Administrator Alicka Ampry-Samuel presides over HUD’s activities in NY and NJ. Appointed in January 2022 by President Biden, Ampry-Samuel oversees over $6 billion in programs and activities across field offices in NYC, Albany, Buffalo, and Newark. Ampry-Samuel engages with stakeholders to increase the housing supply, reduce homelessness, and utilize $595 million awarded in American Rescue Plan funding. Prior to HUD, Ampry-Samuel served as a New York City Council Member and chaired the Public Housing Committee.\n\nWhat led you to get involved in the real estate industry?\n\nI grew up in public housing and understand the importance of providing families with affordable housing. I know what it means to grow up with a stable home and will do all I can to create opportunities for the next generation. We’ve seen an increase in population growth and the need to develop more housing units for families who want to remain in the neighborhoods where they were raised. It’s a labor of love.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in NYC is Brownsville in Brooklyn because it’s a community that’s full of rich history and families with a strong sense of pride. I was a fourth generation Brownsville resident and heard countless stories about my community, carried down from my great-grandmother Sadie Mae who migrated to Brooklyn from North Carolina in the 1930s.\n\nDescribe a recent project you’ve enjoyed working on.\n\nFor years, I walked past empty lots imagining housing units, entertainment space, and a center for young girls. I eventually became a member of the NYC Council and helped push for a Brownsville Community Development Plan. As a result, and pushing community engagement, four empty lots will soon be home to housing for seniors, artists, families, along with a business incubator hub, restaurant, a black box theater, retail space, and the Brownsville Girls Club.\n\nCouncil Member Alexa Avilés represents Red Hook, Sunset Park and parts of Boro Park, Dyker Heights, and Windsor Terrace in the New York City Council. She is a proud New Yorker who lives in Sunset Park with her husband Frankie and their two daughters, who attend New York City public schools. Before her election to City Council, Alexa’s career spanned almost three decades in the not-for-profit and philanthropic sectors.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nAs a lifelong Brooklynite, it is the honor of my life to serve in the City Council for District 38 in South Brooklyn. The communities I represent, Sunset Park, Red Hook and portions of Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, and Borough Park exemplify the best of New York City, its diversity, and history. I’m committed to fighting to keep our neighborhoods affordable, push back against displacement, and stand up for our people.\n\nAt Olive Tree, Ian Bel oversees the company and all affiliate platforms – including Olive Tree Affordable Housing, and Olive Tree Ventures, the PropTech venture investment arm of Olive Tree Holdings. Under Ian’s leadership, Olive Tree has acquired and transformed over 16,000 units of workforce and affordable housing communities across 9 states and has deployed over $250 Million in capital expenditures to enhance the lifestyles of its residents.\n\nWhat led you to get involved in the real estate industry?\n\nWhen I was a student at Binghamton University, I was exposed to landlords taking advantage of residents in the nearby campus housing options, offering poor customer service and living conditions for renters. As a result, in 2005, I invested in my first home and scaled my investment knowledge into a business – purchasing multifamily communities in the area, renovating them, and providing a greater quality of life for students in the area.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nUnion Square is a vibrant and diverse neighborhood located in the heart of New York City, and in my opinion, it’s one of the best places to spend time. With a vibrant atmosphere, bustling markets, and expansive green space – Union Square Park – this area fuses together the serene backdrop of greenery with a lively atmosphere of entertainment.\n\nDescribe a recent project you’ve enjoyed working on.\n\nIn 2021, our leadership team formed Olive Tree Ventures, the standalone PropTech/ConTech venture investment arm of Olive Tree Holdings. Our goal was to create a dedicated ventures group to invest in built-world technologies. I have been focusing on shaping the companies’ investment strategy alongside the ventures team, creating unique initiatives like the Strategic Partner Network, a one-of-a-kind resource and knowledge-sharing network connecting traditional real estate & construction stakeholders with vetted technology solutions.\n\nA sought after voice in Queens real estate, Eric Benaim’s entry into real estate began in 2001. Initially concentrating on Manhattan luxury sales, Eric later recognized the untapped opportunity in his own beloved borough, and turned his focus exclusively to Long Island City. Being credited as single handedly putting Long Island City on the map, he has since expanded to other markets throughout NYC and Jersey City. He successfully completed over $9 billion in sales.\n\nWhat led you to get involved in the real estate industry?\n\nPrior to working in real estate, Eric owned a live event company. After 9/11, he decided to make a career change.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nLong Island City.\n\nDescribe a recent project you’ve enjoyed working on.\n\nInnovation QNS is a 3200 unit Neighborhood currently being planned in the Kaufman Arts District of Astoria. It’s being developed by Silverstein Properties, Kaufman Astoria, and Bedrock Real Estate, and will bring a new five block neighborhood to Astoria, Queens.\n\nAs founder and president of The Berman Group, Sarah Berman works to develop creative communications programs that increase business and reach new audiences. Sarah works with the firm’s clients to develop winning publicity and marketing strategies for both residential and commercial real estate.\n\nSarah earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University in Urban Planning and a master’s degree in Urban Planning from Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service of New York University.\n\nWhat led you to get involved in the real estate industry?\n\nI studied Urban Planning and was fortunate to meet some of the major real estate owners, developers and builders early in my career in communications. I loved watching buildings going up in New York City and I have had some incredible mentors in various areas within the real estate industry.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nNew York City is filled with great neighborhoods that all feel different and unique. The West Village is still my favorite neighborhood but I also love spending a day in Soho, Flatiron/Nomad or any of the exciting areas in Downtown New York. I also represent the Avenue of the Americas Association and have loved watching Midtown thrive and evolve following the Pandemic.\n\nDescribe a recent project you’ve enjoyed working on.\n\nDespite a changing market in both residential and commercial real estate today, we have been fortunate to work with real estate owners across the country to develop new hospitality and amenity programs for residential developments as well as for offices. We have supported Howard Hughes as they have grown some of the most creative residential and mixed-use developments in America and we are currently supporting BXP and RXR in bringing amenities to their office tenants.\n\nJeff Blau is CEO of Related Companies. For the past 25+ years he has been responsible for directing and overseeing new developments worth over $60 billion in virtually every sector of the real estate industry. In his position as CEO, he is responsible for the strategic direction of the company, overall management of the firm, the pursuit of new development opportunities, and corporate acquisitions and financing activities across all business platforms.\n\nWhat led you to get involved in the real estate industry?\n\nMy real estate career started when I was at the University of Michigan. There were lots of different ways that I tried to be entrepreneurial in college, but real estate was the one that really took hold. I started investing in and buying small buildings – and the rest kind of grew from there. I’ve had some great influences and mentors along the way who helped me understand and grow in the industry.\n\nWhat’s your favorite neighborhood in NYC?\n\nThis is an easy one – Hudson Yards. What our Related team has built at Hudson Yards is not just New York City’s newest neighborhood, it is now the heartbeat of Manhattan. Hudson Yards is the commercial center of the city with office, retail, and restaurants. And it’s that mixed-use campus that makes our residential properties here so attractive to buyers and renters. I’ll also just say it’s hard to beat the views we’ve got.\n\nDescribe a recent project you’ve enjoyed working on.\n\nOur project at Willets Point – in partnership with Sterling and NYCFC – is going to turn a blight into a vibrant community in Queens. We’re so proud of Mayor Adams leadership getting us to the point where we’re going to deliver 2,500 100% affordable housing units. In addition, NYCFC is going to build our city’s first soccer-specific stadium. We’ve been working for years on Willets and it’s incredibly exciting to see it move forward.\n\nAs Interim CEO of NYCHA, Lisa Bova-Hiatt is at the helm of the largest public housing authority in the nation. Before assuming this position in September 2022, she served for over two years as NYCHA’s general counsel. She was formerly executive director of the Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery, overseeing the investment of $4.5 billion to rebuild NYS following Superstorm Sandy, and was a senior attorney for nearly 20 years at the NYC Law Department specializing in real estate acquisition.\n\nSpeak to your passion for public service and your current role.\n\nMy 25-year career as a leader in government is rooted in my commitment to serving my fellow New Yorkers, particularly at moments of crisis. I’m especially passionate about housing and real estate in NYC and have worked on the development and implementation of related policies from nearly every post I’ve held. I believe in public and affordable housing and remain committed to preserving this resource and providing a better quality of life to residents.\n\nWhat is the size and scope of NYCHA, and why is it important to New York?\n\nCreated in 1935 to provide decent, affordable housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers, NYCHA has a housing stock that spans all five boroughs and is a city within a city. It’s one of the last remaining sources of truly affordable housing — serving over 339,000 residents through conventional public housing (Section 9), over 29,000 residents at PACT/ RAD developments, and over 92,000 families through federal rent subsidies (Section 8 Leased Housing Program).\n\nDescribe your priorities as NYCHA’s Interim CEO.\n\nFollowing decades of federal disinvestment, NYCHA has a $40 billion capital need that grows by $1 billion a year. As Interim CEO, I am working diligently to address budgetary issues amid a difficult fiscal outlook, overseeing the authority’s continued transformation, and utilizing every available tool (including PACT, Comprehensive Modernization and the newly-established Public Housing Preservation Trust) to preserve and renovate buildings in the portfolio – directly improving conditions for hundreds of thousands of residents."
