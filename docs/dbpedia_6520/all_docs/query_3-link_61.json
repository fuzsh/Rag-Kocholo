        "text": "2.\n\nRisk Assessment: Broadly speaking, a risk assessment is the combined effort of: identifying and analyzing potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e. risk analysis); and making judgments \"on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis\" while considering influencing factors (i.e. risk evaluation).Put in simpler terms, a risk assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is. As part of this process, the resulting determination of risk may be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative fashion. The risk assessment is an inherent part of an overall risk management strategy, which attempts to, after a risk assessment, \"introduce control measures to eliminate or reduce\" any potential risk-related consequences."
