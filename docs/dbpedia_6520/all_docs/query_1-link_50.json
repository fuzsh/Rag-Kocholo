After my remarks, I would like to invite Josh and Joe to say a few words to recognize this important day for the Village of Old Brookville.\n\nRead More\n\nMessage From the Mayor\n\nFall 2020\n\nAs always, your village administration continues to be significantly engaged in addressing the affairs of the Village. At this time, I would like to update you on the following important matters.\n\nA) Village Financial Position\n\nDuring late 2019, the Village was once again rated by Standard and Poors and achieved a triple AAA rating – the best rating possible. Following this, after interest rates significantly declined in April, the Village refinanced $1,955,000 in bonds achieving approximately $40,000 in net savings. Please be assured that during this time of municipal financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that the Village’s financial position is strong and that Village services will not be adversely affected.\n\nB) Village Boards and Services\n\nWhile Village Hall remains closed to the public, the Village had taken the following steps over the past six months to provide for continuing service:\n\na) Board of Trustees has met regularly throughout the year either virtually or on Village Hall grounds using the recommended social distancing protocol.\n\nb) Planning Board and Architectural Review Board have met in person as necessary on Village Hall grounds using social distancing protocol.\n\nc) While Village Court has been closed for the last several months, it is scheduled to reopen monthly sessions in Village Hall starting October 26. Social distancing and mask protocol will be enforced.\n\nd) The offices of the Village Clerk and Building Inspector have maintained their regular hours throughout. Other Village services have also continued uninterrupted.\n\nRead More | Download the PDF Version\n\n► View Past Letters"
