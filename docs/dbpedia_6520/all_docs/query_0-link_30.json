        "text": "In 1986, Connecticut had its first Torch Run with a few legs converging onto the campus of the University of Connecticut at Storrs. The Torch Run then became a statewide event involving several more cities and towns. Since its inception, the LETR has grown into the largest grass-roots fundraising event for Special Olympics Connecticut.\n\nConnecticut Participation at a Glance\n\n1,500 active and retired law enforcement\n\nOver 90 active municipal departments\n\n18 Department of Correction facilities\n\nResources & Downloads\n\n2024 Adopt-a-Mile Form - Pay By Credit/Debit\n\n2024 Adopt-a-Mile Form - Pay By Check\n\n2024 Merchandise Order Form\n\n2024 Fundraising Receipt\n\n2024 CTLETR Handbook\n\n2024 T-Shirt Flyer\n\nThe first Torch Run took place in 1981 and was conceived by Wichita, Kansas Police Chief Richard LaMunyon as a way to involve local law enforcement personnel in the community and to support Special Olympics. The Torch Run was quickly adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) now recognized as the founding law enforcement organization for the Law Enforcement Torch Run® for Special Olympics.\n\nToday, the Torch Run is more than just a run and encompasses a variety of fundraising vehicles and a host of other events that have local, state, and national appeal. For athletes and officers alike, the LETR for Special Olympics is a story of success, love, respect, and commitment between law enforcement officers and Special Olympic athletes."
