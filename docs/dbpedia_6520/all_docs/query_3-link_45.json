        "text": "Regional Administrator Ampry-Samuel presides over HUD’s activities in NY and NJ. Appointed by President Biden, RA Ampry-Samuel oversees nearly $10 billion in programs and activities across the region. RA Ampry-Samuel works with partners, local officials, community stakeholders and residents to ensure the Department’s programs create more affordable and inclusive communities. RA Ampry-Samuel has served in leadership positions at the housing authority, with nonprofit housing developers as well as organizations focused on supportive and transitional housing.\n\nIs there a project you are excited to work on or see completed in 2024?\n\nAs we all work towards tackling the housing supply challenge, I’ve been convening faith-based institutions under the leadership of HUD’s Secretary to strategically address ways to increase affordable housing while preserving our current housing stock. In 2024, I look forward to HUD producing a formal document that provides the nuts and bolts of creating housing on church property through public/private partnerships. The housing crisis we are facing is solvable if we all play our part.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of working in real estate?\n\nThe best part of working in real estate is helping people find a home. And home can mean so many things to different people. Whether it’s building new construction affordable housing for families moving out of the shelter system or building single-family homes for hard-working New Yorkers who participate in first-time home buyer programs. Real estate allows me to meet people wherever they are in their search for a home.\n\nWhat qualities do you believe make up a successful real estate professional?\n\nReal estate professionals have the power to positively impact a person and/or an entire community. Real estate professionals should be passionate about seeing a change in one’s circumstances; they should have a clear vision of the change they want to see; they should have an educational background that provides the tools needed to make the change possible; and the experience to bring the pieces together for implementation.\n\nEric Benaim, a well-respected figure in Queens real estate, boasts a career since 2001. He pivoted to Manhattan luxury sales before spotting potential in Long Island City. In 2006, he sold 50 residences, earning renown for connecting properties and people. Despite 2008’s challenges, he launched Modern Spaces, revolutionizing LIC’s real estate. His personalized approach led to rapid expansion across offices, claiming a 70% LIC market share with $5.5B in sales and $4B oversight.\n\nIs there a project you are excited to work on or see completed in 2024?\n\nThe Bold, a new luxury rental project slated to be completed this summer\n\nWhat is your favorite part of working in real estate?\n\nPlaying a part in shaping a neighborhood\n\nWhat qualities do you believe make up a successful real estate professional?\n\nPatience, having a long view, and understanding that sometimes short-term pain is worth the long-term gain\n\nLisa was appointed CEO of NYCHA in July 2023 after serving as interim CEO since September 2022. In this role, she’s at the helm of the largest Public Housing Authority in the nation. Lisa’s nearly 30 years in public service are rooted in her strong commitment to serving New Yorkers. She was formerly executive director of the Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery and, for nearly two decades, was a senior attorney at the NYC Law Department.\n\nWhat work are you focused on in 2024?\n\nFollowing decades of federal disinvestment, NYCHA has a nearly $80 billion capital need. As CEO, I have been working diligently to address budgetary challenges and to oversee the Authority’s continued transformation – ensuring that we are refining our business practices and using every available tool (including PACT, Comprehensive Modernization and the newly established Public Housing Preservation Trust) to preserve and renovate buildings in the portfolio, directly improving conditions for hundreds of thousands of residents.\n\nWhat is a recent achievement you are particularly proud of?\n\nThis past year, I was proud to lead the charge to secure ERAP funds for NYCHA residents, ensuring they could benefit from the same COVID-related rental assistance as other New Yorkers. I’m proud of our ongoing success with the PACT program, having now converted more than 20,000 units. This past fall, NYCHA held its first-ever resident-vote, with Nostrand Houses residents selecting the Public Housing Preservation Trust to bring large-scale investment into their homes.\n\nWhat role does NYCHA play in the New York City Real Estate Market?\n\nFor many low-and-moderate-income New Yorkers, NYCHA is a critical source of affordable housing. As the largest landlord in New York City, NYCHA oversees a housing stock that spans all five boroughs and is a city within a city – serving more than 528,000 authorized residents through public housing, PACT and Section 8 housing combined. NYCHA has 177,569 apartments in 2,411 buildings across 335 public housing and PACT developments – underscoring its size and significance.\n\nRafael brings over 30 years of experience tackling the most pressing housing challenges facing cities today. Since joining CPC in 2012, he has expanded the company’s business and social impact nationally. Under his leadership, CPC launched a successful mortgage lending subsidiary, became one of a few CDFIs to receive an AA- rating from S&P, and in FY22 eclipsed $1 Billion in lending and investing for the first time. Rafael cohosts the podcast The Housing Problem.\n\nIs there a project you are excited to work on or see completed in 2024?\n\nCPC is leading a partnership that recently assumed responsibility for the servicing and asset management of the former Signature Bank’s rent-regulated and stabilized loan portfolio. We understand the unique role that rent-regulated housing plays in our neighborhoods, the distinct financial challenges facing its owners and operators in today’s market, and its importance as a haven of affordability to its tenants. It’s a big responsibility but it’s one we’re excited about.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of working in real estate?\n\nI’ve spent my entire career in affordable housing and community development, and being able to help make a positive social impact is easily the best thing about the job. As a nonprofit lender, at CPC we can help local developers grow their businesses, we can bring investments in housing to communities that are struggling, and we can ensure that residents have affordable homes they can be proud of. It’s all about creating positive outcomes.\n\nWhat qualities do you believe make up a successful real estate professional?\n\nYou need to be able to see the bigger picture and be patient. There are usually multiple partners, different financing sources – including subsidy, and varying timelines that can be challenging. Knowing what levers to pull to keep things moving is important. You also need to care about people. If you don’t, there are easier ways to make money than doing this work. We’re creating homes where people will put down roots and raise families.\n\nKenneth Crystal, partner at Phillips Lytle LLP, is a seasoned real estate lawyer with a national practice and deep connections in New York City who has built a reputation with his clients for getting the deal done. Ken’s clients range from Fortune 100 automotive manufacturers, global financial institutions and fashion retailers to companies establishing their first presence in New York City. He focuses on commercial real estate, including real estate leasing, finance and restructurings.\n\nIs there a project you are excited to work on or see completed in 2024?\n\nWe work on projects that impact the New York City skyline from downtown to Harlem, as well as retail and infrastructure projects from California to Maine. We also work on very small, but just as important projects, such as hundred-year-old buildings that are at imminent risk of collapse but may possess valuable zoning rights.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of working in real estate?\n\nMy favorite part of working in real estate is its tangibility. You get to see the results of all of your efforts, which is very rewarding. In addition, you can always find your project; they may not always turn out the way we hoped, but at least you can find them; they won’t disappear.\n\nWhat qualities do you believe make up a successful real estate professional?\n\nTo be a true counselor and advisor, you need to understand the needs and motivations of all of the parties to the transaction and think like a businessperson as well as a lawyer. Preparing documents that accurately reflect the transaction is just the baseline."
