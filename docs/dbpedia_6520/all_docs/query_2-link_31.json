At this time, we are limiting 1 map per email/mailing address. If you are a school, library, law enforcement agency or any other institution need of a larger volume, the request will need to be submitted from an official school/library/law enforcement email account.\n\nThe Illinois Official Highway Map is published every other year and is available to the public free of charge. The electronic version of the map is available here: Illinois Official Highway Map PDF.\n\nOfficial Highway paper maps are also available by order. See the Map Ordering section below for more information on ordering maps.\n\nThe township classification maps depict the urban classification of the road network for larger city urban areas that do not fit on one single map sheet (eg: Chicago, South Beloit, Rockford, Peoria and E. St. Louis Urban Areas) and emphasize the display of the road network on a regional basis without regard to specific city and village boundaries.\n\nThe Illinois Official Bicycle Maps are available electronically by County. See the ‘Trails, Paths & Streets’ site for more information and to access electronic bicycle maps.\n\nOfficial Bicycle paper maps, broken down by IDOT District are also available by order. See Map Ordering section below for more information on ordering maps."
