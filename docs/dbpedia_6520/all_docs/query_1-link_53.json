They bring expertise in both technical practice and implementation - our new board members have backgrounds in government, economic development, sustainability, public affairs, and tourism.\n\nBringing renewed energy and multi-borough representation to NY4P, they're already helping to lead us into our next chapter of growth.\n\nKate Collignon is a Partner at HR&A Advisors, an industry-leading economic development, real estate advisory, and public policy consulting firm that has provided strategic advisory services for complex mixed-use development projects and urban open spaces for over forty years.\n\nAt HR&A, Kate’s open space work focuses on enabling communities to create value and public benefits through strategic connections with adjacent real estate and civic assets.

Kate also drives the growth of the firm’s inclusive Cities practice to promote equitable development within cities. She has directed and contributed to many of HR&A’s most complex planning and development projects, including OneNYC, New York City’s long-term strategic plan for equitable growth; a modernization strategy for Research Triangle Park; an award-winning open space and master plan for Philadelphia’s Delaware River Waterfront; and community-driven capital plans under the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program and the NYS Downtown Revitalization Initiative.
