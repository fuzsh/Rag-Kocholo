        "text": "Town in Connecticut, United States\n\nTown in Connecticut, United States\n\nBrookfield is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, situated within the southern foothills of the Berkshire Mountains.[1] The population was 17,528 at the 2020 census.[2] The town is located 55 miles (89 km) northeast of New York City, making it part of the New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA combined statistical area.[3] The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. In July 2013, Money magazine ranked Brookfield the 26th-best place to live in the United States, and the best place to live in Connecticut.[4]\n\nColonists settled in what is now known as Brookfield in 1710, led by John Muirwood and other colonial founders including Hawley, Peck and Merwin. They bartered for the land from the Wyantenuck and the Potatuck Nations who were ruled under the Sachems Waramaug and Pocono. Sachem Pocono's village was in an enormous palisade along the Still River. Colonists first established the area as the Parish of Newbury, incorporating parts of neighboring Newtown and Danbury. The parish later was renamed and incorporated as the town of Brookfield in 1788, named for Rev. Thomas Brooks, the first minister of the parish's Congregational church.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Brookfield, Connecticut\n\nEarly people who lived in Brookfield were subsistence farmers, gatherers, and hunters. The main food sources were corn, beans, squash and wild foods found in the rocky, heavily forested foothills of the Berkshire Mountains of Brookfield and New Milford. Such wild foods that were harvested were white oak acorns, American chestnuts, shag bark hickory nuts, may apples, beach nuts and Solomon's seal. The hunted animals that were taken[5] from the forest and rivers were deer, passenger pigeon, turkey, bass, trout, crawfish, squirrel, rabbit and others.[6] In the 18th century the community was called \"Newbury\", a name that came from the three towns from which its land was taken—New Milford, Newtown, and Danbury.[5]\n\nAs traveling to surrounding churches was difficult in winter, in 1752 the General Assembly granted the community the right to worship in area homes from September through March. In 1754, the General Assembly granted permission for the Parish of Newbury to build its own meeting house and recruit its own minister. On September 28, 1757, the first Congregational Church building was dedicated. The Reverend Thomas Brooks was ordained as the first settled minister. When incorporated in 1778, the town's name was changed to Brookfield in honor of Brooks, who was still the minister.[5]\n\nAlong the Still River, mills were in operation as early as 1732 in an area that became known as the Iron Works District. Brookfield was a thriving town with iron furnaces, grist mills, sawmills, comb shops, carding and cotton mills, a paper mill, a knife factory, hat factories, stage-coach shops, lime kilns, harness shops and other plants in operation. The grist mill still stands, as the Brookfield Craft Center. The Iron Works Aqueduct Company, formed in 1837 to supply water from mountain springs to the Iron Works District, still supplies water as the Brookfield Water Company.[5][6]\n\nBefore 1912, the town had two train stations: one in the Iron Works District near the present Brookfield Market and a second, Junction Station, near the corner of Junction Road and Stony Hill Road.[5]\n\nThe Danbury & Bethel Gas and Electric Company brought electricity to Brookfield in 1915.[5] The .475 Wildey Magnum gun, later made famous in the 1985 Charles Bronson movie Death Wish 3, was developed by Wildey J. Moore in Brookfield in the early 1970s (the factory has since moved to Warren, Connecticut).\n\nIn the early 1970s, the town was home to the headquarters of Lego USA.[7]\n\nThroughout the 1970s and late 20th century, Brookfield saw a massive influx in its population. This is attributed to New Yorkers who began relocating from the city to the suburbs. This created rapid real estate development in Brookfield, and turned Brookfield into a popular commuter town for those who work in and around New York City.[8] The top professions of residents today are in the fields of professional, scientific, and technical services, health care, and finance and insurance.[9] As of 2022, 88.7% of residents in the workforce hold white-collar jobs, and about 20% work remotely full-time.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.4 square miles (53 km2), of which 19.8 square miles (51 km2) is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2), or 2.94%, is water. It borders Bethel to the south, Newtown to the southeast, Danbury to the southwest, New Fairfield to the west, New Milford to the northwest, and Bridgewater to the northeast.\n\nBrookfield is located between the two largest lakes in Connecticut. Candlewood Lake (the largest) spans the west side of the town, while Lake Lillinonah spans the entire east side. The Still River also runs directly through the town, flowing directionally from south to north.\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town's largest neighborhoods include:\n\nBrookfield Town Center (known to locals as \"Four Corners\") is the downtown shopping district of Brookfield. The area is experiencing heavy growth and revitalization in recent years with new apartment and shopping buildings, bringing over 150 new apartments and dozens of new stores. It is also a potential site for a future railway station.[11]\n\nBrookfield Center is the original town center and a historic district, added NRHP, September 15, 1991). The original town hall, original general store, historic society, several churches, and an elementary school are located here.\n\nOther named minor neighborhoods and geographic locations in the town are:\n\nBarkwood Falls\n\nBrookfield Junction\n\nCandlewood Lake Club\n\nCandlewood Orchards\n\nCandlewood Shores\n\nEast Iron Works\n\nHuckleberry Hill\n\nIron Works\n\nLong Meadow Hill\n\nObtuse\n\nPocono Ridge\n\nProspect Hill\n\nViva Farms\n\nWest Iron Works\n\nWhisconier\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBrookfield has a humid continental climate, similar to that of New York City, with mild to warm humid summers and cold to very cold winters. The highest recorded temperature was 103 °F (39 °C) in July 1966, while the lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) in 1968.[12] Snowfall is generally frequent in winter while average precipitation is most common in September.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nCompanies in Brookfield include:\n\nBNP Associates, an airport systems designer, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nBranson Ultrasonics, a division of Emerson, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nBridgewater Chocolate, a premium chocolate manufacturer, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nCerulean Studios, an instant messaging software company, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nLego USA was formerly headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nMcMullin Manufacturing Corporation, a contract manufacturing company of precision metal stampings, fabricated metal parts and assemblies, is headquartered in Brookfield.[14]\n\nMillbrook Press, an international book publisher, was formerly headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nNordex Inc, a manufacturer of medical and robotics components, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nPhotronics, a major semiconductor manufacturer, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nROMTech, a medical device technology company, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nSouthridge Technology, an IT company, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nTownsquare Media has a corporate office in Brookfield.\n\nTrendhaven Investment Management, an investment firm, is headquartered in Brookfield.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18201,159—18501,359—18601,224−9.9%18701,193−2.5%18801,152−3.4%1890989−14.1%19001,0465.8%19101,1015.3%1920896−18.6%19309263.3%19401,34545.2%19501,68825.5%19603,405101.7%19709,688184.5%198012,87232.9%199014,1139.6%200015,66411.0%201016,4525.0%202017,5286.5%\n\nThe 2020 US Census counted a total population of 17,528. The total number of households in Brookfield was recorded at 6,209 with an average of 2.73 persons per household.[15] The population density was recorded at 861.9 persons per square mile (332.8 persons/km2).\n\nAccording to the 2020 Census, the population of Brookfield was 86.4% White, 4.2% Asian, 3.1% Black or African American, and 0.2% Pacific Islander.

About 28.5% of Brookfield residents were younger than age 18 as of 2020; higher than the U.S. average of 24%. 15.1% of Brookfield residents were born outside of the United States.\n\nAs of the census[17] of 2000, there were 15,664 people, 5,572 households, and 4,368 families residing in the town. The population density was 791.1 inhabitants per square mile (305.4/km2). There were 5,781 housing units at an average density of 292.0 per square mile (112.7/km2).

The town has several elective offices as well: the town clerk, probate judge, registrar of voters, tax collector and treasurer.\n\nThe Board of Finance approves financial measures, including the town budget; the Board of Education controls the town's public schools; the Representative Town Meeting is the main legislative body of the town. The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one Democrat and two Republicans or two Democrats and one Republican. Many of the town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.[18]\n\nAt the state level, Brookfield is in the 107th House district, currently represented by State Rep. Martin Foncello (R).[19] Brookfield is part of the 30th and 32nd Senate districts, currently represented by State Sen. Stephen Harding (R) of Brookfield,[20] and State Sen. Eric Berthel (R) of Watertown.[21] At the federal level, Brookfield is part of the 5th congressional district, which is represented by Rep.

The school is located on the grounds of the former Huckleberry Hill School, and replaced both Huckleberry and Center School (Pre-K–5).[25] The school opened in September 2023, in time for the 2023–24 school year.[26]\n\nPrivate schools\n\n[edit]\n\nSt. Joseph Elementary School (Catholic School, Grades Pre-K–8; now houses the Danbury Primary School for kindergartners)\n\nChristian Life Academy (Christian School, Grade Pre-K)\n\nCountry Kids Child Care (Grades Pre-K–K)\n\nGoddard School (Grades Pre-K–K)\n\nMontessori Community School (Grades Pre-K–K)\n\nCurtis School for Boys (All-boys boarding school open from 1883 to 1943. Starting in the 1920s, girls were allowed to enroll as day-students. The school has since become the Brookfield Theatre for the Arts.)[27]\n\nThe Western Connecticut Academy of International Studies is a magnet school in Danbury, Connecticut, that students (Grades K–5) from Brookfield are accepted into. Students to this school are also accepted from Bethel, Redding, Ridgefield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Newtown, and other regional communities. Henry Abbott Technical High School is a public technical high school for students grades 9–12, being located in Danbury but also accepting students from other regional communities.\n\nMany residents of Brookfield attend private schools in the Greater Danbury area, including Canterbury School (9–12), Immaculate High School (9–12) and Wooster School (Pre-K–12).\n\nThe Brookfield Craft Center is a specialized, non-degree school which teaches the skills of craftsmanship and offers courses and workshops to the general public. It is largely housed in an old historic mill house, on the Still River.\n\nDowntown redevelopment project\n\n[edit]\n\nFor years, despite being a major economic center for retail in Fairfield County, Brookfield had lacked a walkable downtown area. Most of the large economic activity was centered on the southern portion of Federal Road near Danbury.[28] In 2016, construction began on a project known as \"Brookfield Village\", which will create a downtown district consisting of sidewalks, a pocket park, street lamps, and parallel parking.[29] Dozens of retail storefronts and residential apartment buildings (more than 150 units) are also being developed in this area, which has gained attention from retailers and will promote further development in the area.[30] In conjunction with other retail developments on Federal Road and with the completion of Phase I of the newly revitalized district, many new restaurants, stores and boutiques have recently opened in the Town Center District.[31]\n\nCommunity and points of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nBrookfield Arts Commission – A commission established in 1990 by the town consisting of 15 board members; the commission was created to engage in activities which are intended to promote understanding and appreciation of the arts to residents of the Town of Brookfield, encourage community participation in arts activities, coordinate information concerning artists and the arts within town, act as a liaison between artists, schools and the community, engage in activities designed to encourage local artists in demonstrating their talents, and promote activities that both entertain and enlighten.

At this time, the former \"Joyce Memorial Library\" was renamed \"The Brookfield Library\".[37] Several proposals have been made to construct a new library in Brookfield, due to the significant increase in population since 1975 when the current facility was constructed.[38] In 2002, the Library Board of Trustees began the planning stage for a new library, and in 2009, a one million dollar state grant was awarded for the construction of a new library.[39] A referendum was held in February 2018 over whether or not to begin construction on a 36,000 square foot library at a cost of 14.7 million dollars, although the motion did not pass.[40] The Library Committee is now revising the plan, with hopes to bring a revised plan to referendum.[41]\n\nBrookfield Theatre for the Arts – a theatre where community productions of various plays are held.

Many finance and business executives also reside in Brookfield, due to the centralization of investment firms and hedge funds in Fairfield County, as well as many Fortune 500 companies.[107]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2010 film All Good Things, starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst, several scenes used a Brookfield lake house on Lake Lillinonah as the set.[108]\n\nThe 2021 movie The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is based on the 1981 trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. This was the first murder case in all of Brookfield's history.[109]\n\nScenes from the 1968 movie Rachel, Rachel were filmed in Brookfield.\n\nThe 1988–1989 TV series Michaels' Movie Madness was shot in Brookfield.[110]\n\nThe short film Innocence was mostly filmed in Brookfield.[111]\n\nIn the 1941 film The Lady Eve, starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck, Fonda's character hosts lavish parties in a fictional town called Bridgefield, Connecticut, right outside of New York. This fictional town is based on either the town of Brookfield, Ridgefield or Bridgewater, as they have similar sounding names and fit this demographic at the time.[112]\n\nArcadia Publishing created an Images of America book detailing the History of Brookfield, composed by Marilyn S. Whittlesey.[113]\n\nAnnals of Brookfield, Fairfield County, Connecticut was written by Emily C. Hawley, and published in 1929.[114]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nHighways\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate 84 and U.S. Route 7 are the main highways in Brookfield. From the South, US 7 and US 202 jointly exit Interstate 84 at Exit 7 near Danbury. To the South, US 7 connects to the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95 in Norwalk. US 202 then splits from US 7 at Exit 11, and runs parallel north through town before reconnecting with US 7 near the New Milford border. For many years, US 7 and US 202 ran concurrently through Brookfield but, after decades of discussion and planning, the US 7 Bypass officially opened on November 2009.[115] The Governor of Connecticut at the time was Jodi Rell (R), a Brookfield resident.\n\nConnecticut Route 133 connects Brookfield to its eastern neighbor Bridgewater over the iconic Southville Bridge, which spans the Housatonic River. Connecticut Route 25 also connects Brookfield with Newtown and its Hawleyville neighborhood to the southeast, passing by Interstate 84 and terminating at US 6.[116] Interstate 84 passes through the southern tip of Brookfield, but is most directly accessible through Exit 9 in Hawleyville.\n\nBrookfield is located along U.S. Bicycle Route 7, which runs from Norwalk, Connecticut, to the border between Vermont and Quebec.\n\nBuses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town is part of the \"4 Route\", \"7 Route\" and \"New Milford Loop\", which are operated by Housatonic Area Regional Transit (HART).[117] A park and ride is located at 67 White Turkey Road Ext., and offers connections to nearby bus and train stations as well as nearby airports.[118] HART operates a direct shuttle for commuters between the park and ride and Brewster station from 5 AM to 10 PM on weekdays.[119]\n\nRailroad\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil 1971, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (later the Penn Central Railroad) operated commuter service between Grand Central Terminal and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which included a stop in Brookfield. Brookfield's station building is currently occupied by the Brookfield Craft Center, which ceased to operate as a station in 1971 when service ended. There was also a station on Stony Hill Road known as Brookfield Junction, which closed in 1925.\n\nProposals have been made to extend the New Haven Line's Danbury Branch to New Milford, which would include a Brookfield Metro-North station.[120] The Danbury Branch provides commuter rail service between Danbury, to South Norwalk, Stamford, and Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The tracks north of Danbury are currently used by the Housatonic Railroad for freight service. This extension would give Brookfield's significant population of commuters another way to travel to Lower Fairfield County and New York City, since they must currently leave from the nearby Danbury station or other stations along the New Haven or Harlem Lines, such as Brewster station (located 12 miles from Brookfield).\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe closest public airport to Brookfield is Danbury Municipal Airport, being located in neighboring Danbury. Brookfield is within close proximity of several airports with commercial service, including Westchester County Airport, Bradley International Airport, Tweed New Haven Airport and NYC airports of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nEmergency services\n\n[edit]\n\nFire Department and EMS\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town of Brookfield has two volunteer fire companies in town staffing three stations, with the headquarters for the Brookfield Volunteer Fire Company being at 92 Pocono Rd, the Center Company at 6 Obtuse Hill Rd and the Brookfield Volunteer Fire Department Candlewood Company at 18 Bayview Dr.[121] The department was founded in 1934, and is composed entirely of volunteers.\n\nPolice Department\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Brookfield Police Department Headquarters is located at 63 Silvermine Rd, adjacent to the Brookfield Municipal Center. The department was established on July 1, 1977, and as of 2017, consists of 34 full-time officers, 6 special officers and 12 full and part-time civilian personnel. The Department Command Staff consists of the chief of police, a major and a captain. There is a Patrol Division, a Detective Division, including a youth officer and two school resource officers, and part-time SCUBA Team, Accident Investigation Team, tactical response technicians with the Danbury Police Department, and part-time evidence technicians.[122][123] Brookfield has plans to expand the current police headquarters, citing a growth in the population served, as well as the size of the police force.[124]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nWINE-AM 940; 1,000 watts; CBS Sports Radio affiliated station\n\nWRKI-FM 95.1; 50,000 watts; the station has a \"mainstream rock\" format and covers Fairfield, Litchfield, New Haven counties in Connecticut and Putnam, Dutchess, Westchester counties in New York\n\nThe News-Times is the most prominent newspaper serving the Greater Danbury area, and reports on local news in Brookfield.[125]The Brookfield Daily Voice and The Brookfield Patch are the two most prominent local online newspapers.\n\nBrookfield's public-access channels are channels 162 (education) and 164 (community), and are made available by Charter Spectrum.[126]\n\nNews 12 Connecticut is the local cable news station serving Fairfield County, and covers local news in Brookfield.[127] The town is part of the New York City media market for news and entertainment, and most networks for the Hartford-New Haven market are provided alongside New York TV stations.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nConnecticut portal\n\nNew England portal\n\nHistory of Brookfield, Connecticut\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
