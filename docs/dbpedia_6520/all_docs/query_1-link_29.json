        "text": "Brookfield Renewable U.S., headquartered in New York City, owns, operates and develops a diversified portfolio of hydropower, wind, solar and storage facilities across 34 states, totaling approximately 7,300 megawatts of generating capacity. Our diversified renewable platform generates approximately 22 million megawatt-hours of clean and renewable power, enough electricity to power approximately 2 million homes annually.\n\nWith over 120 years of experience in power generation, Brookfield Renewable U.S. operates our facilities with best-in-class standards, while also leveraging our footprint to extend an array of economic, social and environmental benefits in surrounding communities. We employ over seven hundred dedicated professionals in the day-to-day operations of our facilities, business and project development.\n\nBrookfield Renewable U.S.’s generating, trading and marketing businesses are a part of Toronto-based Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P., (NYSE: BEP; TSX: BEP.UN), one of the world’s largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable power platforms.\n\nAbout the School Street Hydroelectric Project\n\nThe 38-megawatt School Street Hydroelectric Project, Falls View Park and Overlook Park are owned and operated by Erie Boulevard Hydropower LP, a subsidiary of Brookfield. School Street Hydroelectric is a Heritage Award-winning site, as distinguished by the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. The project harnesses the power of the Mohawk River to provide renewable power to New York State. The facility is Low Impact Hydropower Institute (LIHI) certified.\n\nHydropower Safety\n\nSafety is a top priority for Brookfield Renewable , and is an essential aspect of doing business.\n\nBrookfield has set very high standards to minimize risks at its hydropower plants.\n\nWhile these wonderful water resources are producing electricity to help make our lives easier, we remind visitors to any hydropower facility to be aware of safety warning and procedures.\n\nSafety tips for recreating near hydropower facilities:\n\n• Always use a Coast Guard-approved life vest or other approved personal flotation device.\n\n• When boating, kayaking, fishing, hiking or swimming, stay well away from dams, discharges and water intakes.\n\n• Respect all warning signs and devices\n\n• Swim only in designated locations manned by lifeguards.\n\n• Know your physical limitations and abilities.\n\n• In fishing streams, wade with caution and use footwear with non-slip soles.\n\n• Keep water drawstrings tight and never get into a situation in which waders and boots could flood.\n\n• Always keep alert for changes in water levels and currents and move to the nearest shore immediately if water appears to rise.\n\n• Use only designated recreation areas. Do not trespass on the hydroelectric facility site or private property excluded from public access.\n\n• Stay clear of areas designated as no entry zones.\n\n• Properly maintain and extinguish all campfires and extend courtesies to others in public access areas.\n\n• Carry in, carry it out!\n\nHydropower in the United States\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, in 2019, hydropower capacity (80.25 GW) in 2,270 Hydropower Plants in the U.S. accounted for 6.7% of installed electricity generation capacity in the United States and its generation (274 TWh) represented 6.6% of all electricity generated and 38% of electricity from renewables produced in the U.S."
