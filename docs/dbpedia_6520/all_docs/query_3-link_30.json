        "text": "Written for the Brookfield Schools by: Marilyn Whittlesey, Town Historian and edited by: Margaret Shirley, Retired Brookfield School Teacher\n\nThe first to settle this area were the Pootatuck Indians. There were many local branches of this tribe. The Pomperaug Indians were in Woodbury, the Bantam Indians were in Litchfield, the Piscatacooks were in Kent and the Weantinocks were in New Milford. The chief of the Weantinocks was Chief Waramaug. At one time a wild cherry tree was located on Route 133 and was said to be the very place where the Indians would meet and hold their pow-wows. The tree was called the Indian Tree.\n\nMany names or words that we use today come from the Indians. Lake Waramaug was named for the great chief. Pocono Road was named for Chief Pocono. Many states were named using Indian words. The word Connittecock means a “long river”. It is now called Connecticut. Massachusetts means “at or about the great hill”. Housatonic means “over the mountain”. Lillinonah was the name of the daughter of Chief Waramaug.\n\nA prominent tribesman, matron or grandmother usually named a child. Boys were given the name of a deceased Indian, an object or an event in the heavens. He might be “Little Thunder” or “Bright Bird”. The girls were given names that represented the earth or the waters. Their names might be “Little Fox” or “Shining Waters”. Names could come from something that they were good at doing or an important event in their life. One such name might be “Dances With Wolves” or “The Woman of the Green Field”.\n\nThe availability of firewood, game, and fertile fields determined where the Indians would build their village. These villages were usually built along a pond, river or lake. The wigwams were placed around a circle where the men would meet for games and ceremonies.\n\nThe wigwams were built by placing saplings in a circle every two or three feet. The saplings were covered with mats of reeds sewn together with openings placed at the north and south sides. There was an opening left in the roof for smoke to escape from. This opening was covered with a mat that was attached to a stick, so it could be opened or closed. The doors were also covered with mats. These mats were made of deerskin or bark.\n\nInside the wigwams mats covered the ceiling and walls. They were also used for bed coverings, to sit upon, or for drying food.\n\nThe smaller wigwams would hold two or three families. The larger ones could hold four families.\n\nWhen the Indians moved to a new area, they would fold up the mats and leave the frames behind. When they returned to the area, they would use the old frames.\n\nIn the spring, when the leaves of the white oak were as large as a mouse’s ears, it was time to plant. The Indians would plant corn, beans and squash. These were called the three sisters. The women of the tribe would build mounds of dirt. Into these mounds they would place two or three fish for fertilizer. They then planted four kernels of corn in each mound along with beans. The stalks of the corn were used as poles for the bean’s vines. Also planted in each mound were squash or pumpkin seeds.\n\nIn the fall they harvested these crops, so they would have food for the winter. After the harvest the men hunted so they would have meat to eat, and skin and fur to keep them warm. The Indians also gathered acorns, nuts, and berries. They would fish in the streams and rivers that were well stocked with fish. They dried the vegetables, meat, and fish on mats. They then packed this food into baskets and stored it underground for use in the winter.\n\nAlmost 160 years before the official birth of Brookfield, the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth. As more and more people arrived in the New World, they began to move away from Plymouth and settle other areas. Following the old Indian trails Reverend Thomas Hooker led a group of about 100 followers and established the first white community in the area to be called Connecticut. This community would become Hartford. During this same time period, John Oldman established Wethersfield; Roger Ludlow established Windsor and John Winthrop established Old Saybrook Colony.\n\nNewbury/Brookfield\n\nIn the 1700’s people started to move to the area that is now known as Danbury, Newtown and New Milford. As these towns grew people living in the outskirts of the towns, wanted a church and town of their own. They petitioned the government of the Connecticut Colony to establish the Parish of Newbury. In 1752, boundaries for the parish were drawn. The residents were also granted permission to have winter privilege meetings. This meant that the residents of the Parish of Newbury could worship in the houses in the parish from November to March. Two years later, the Parish was incorporated and the same boundaries that had been set in 1752 were made the official boundaries The Government took land from Danbury, Newtown and New Milford to establish the Parish called Newbury. Besides taking the land, they took parts of their names. The residents were given permission to levy a tax to raise money so they could build their own church. On September 28, 1757, the first meetinghouse was dedicated and the Reverend Thomas Brooks was ordained as their first settled pastor. In 1788, the parish became a town and the name was changed to Brookfield in honor of Reverend Thomas Brooks.\n\nNow that Brookfield was a town, the residents could make their own laws and govern the town. They elected a Town Clerk, Selectmen, State representatives, a Tythingman, Howards, Fence Viewers, Collector of the Town Rate, List Takers, Grand Juryman, Gager, Snow Packer, Leather Sealer, Sealer of Weights, Sealer of Measures, Bee Keeper and Surveyor of Highways.\n\nAfter Candlewood Lake was built, some of the town of New Fairfield was left on this side of the lake. So in 1961 Candlewood Shores, Hickory Hills, Candlewood Orchards, the Brookfield Town Park and Arrowhead Point all became a part of Brookfield.\n\nIn 1955, Lake Lillinonah was built when the Shepaug Dam was built. The lake was filled over night when Hurricane Diane went through the area. The Lake is fourteen miles long.\n\nThe Still River provided an ideal site for industry to move into the area that would be called the Iron Works Village. There were many different kinds of shops located here. The earliest factories made muskets, chains, and anchors. There was also an iron furnace. More factories began moving to this area. There were shear shops where shears, knives and scissors were made. There were factories where hats were made. There were button, cheese, clock, and iron factories. There were sawmills and gristmills.\n\nThe gristmill was an important place in town. One of the main parts of the resident’s diet was bread. The gristmill was where the farmers brought their wheat, rye and barley to be made into flour. The flour was used in their homes. When there was extra flour, the farmers could sell or barter it for items that the family might need.\n\nAnother important place in the town was the Village Store. This is where the residents could buy what they needed to live on. Many of the residents would trade what they grew on their farms for items that they needed. The shopkeeper would keep track of what was sold or traded.\n\nThe store was also a meeting place. In the summer, residents could relax on the porch and discuss the weather or what was going on in town. In the winter they would sit around the potbelly stove and play checkers.\n\nJust about anything you could imagine was sold in the Village store. There were spices from around the world. The shelves were filled with material for making clothes as well as ready-made clothing. There were barrels and sacks filled with all different types of food. There was usually a pickle barrel where you could buy fresh pickles. There was meat, canned goods, medicine, and items for your horse. There were tools and gadgets of all kinds. There was usually a penny candy counter where there were tempting candies. To be given a penny to buy a piece of candy was a very special treat.\n\nAt one time Brookfield was made up of mostly farms. If you didn’t live on a farm, your family would probably have a vegetable garden. On the larger farms the farmers would sell or barter some of their crops. The rest of the crops were preserved and used for their families. Some of these crops were wheat and barley that was turned into flour. Many of the farmers grew and sold tobacco.\n\nThere were dairy farms, chicken farms and sheep farms. Some of the more unusual farms in Brookfield were the Chinchilla and Pheasant farms. Brookfield had many apple trees in the early days. Two different apples were developed in Brookfield. The first was called “Colonel Hawley” which was a small white apple. The second was called the “Johnson Apple”. This apple was large and red in color. The Beers Orchard had over 1000 fruit trees and the Clark Orchard had over 500 fruit trees. Today many of those trees are still providing fruit to their owners.\n\nIt was very important to the settlers to have a place for learning. One-room schools were built in many different sections of a town, because everyone walked to school. At one time Brookfield had eight one-room schools. They were Whisconier, Huckleberry (called Whortleberry School at one time), Center, Bound Swamp, Longmeadow Hill, Obtuse, East Iron Works and West Iron Works Schools. The very first school was East Iron Works School and it was built on land donated by Joseph Ruggles. The school was at the corner of Farview Road and Whisconier Road.\n\nThe school was one room filled with desks for the students. Children of all ages were taught in this one room. There was a potbelly stove and everyone was expected to bring wood for the stove. In the front of the room, next to the teacher’s desk was a stool. If you did not behave or do your lessons, you would sit on the stool with a dunce cap on.\n\nStudents were taught reading, writing, arithmetic and manners. The girls were taught to sew and do handiwork. Because paper was very expensive, the students would write on slates. The first books that students used were called hornbooks. These books were made out of wood covered by a thin piece of paper that was attached with a piece of horn. They had a handle with a hole in it. String was strung through the hole so it could be worn around the neck. On the paper was printed the alphabet, Roman numerals, the Lord’s Prayer and verses.\n\nMany of the old roads were once paths that the Indians had used. As more people moved to this area, more roads were built. These roads became wider so that wagons and stagecoaches could use them. Some of these roads were called toll roads. Along these roads would be tollhouses. You had to stop at these houses and pay a fee to use the road.\n\nIn 1840 the first railroad was constructed in Brookfield. It was called the Housatonic Railroad. It was built in the Iron Works district and was called the Brookfield Station. The second train station was built on Stony Hill Road and was called the Junction Station. Because Brookfield had no high school, the students would travel by train to Danbury, New Milford or Newtown High School.\n\nCandlewood Lake\n\nCandlewood Lake is a very special place to us all. But did you know that it was not always here? Candlewood Lake is the largest man-made lake in Connecticut. Before the land was flooded, farms crisscrossed by stonewall; dirt roads, apple orchards, mills and ponds were all located in this area.\n\nThe farmers sold their land and moved. The trees and brush were cut down to make way for the lake. It took 26 months to fill the eleven-mile lake. The lake covers 5,420 acres. The widest part of the lake is two miles across. The towns of Danbury, Brookfield, New Milford, New Fairfield and Sherman are located on the lake.\n\nOn July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light & Power approved a pump storage facility plant for producing electricity. This plant works by having the lake water pour down a pipe into a turbine that produces electricity.\n\nThe name Candlewood comes from Candlewood Mountain in New Milford. The trees on the mountain were named Candlewood Trees since the settlers would light the branches from the saplings and use them as candles.\n\nTime Line of Brookfield History\n\n1620 – The Pilgrims arrive in the New World\n\n1700 – White people begin to arrive in this area\n\n1752 – Boundaries set for the Parish of Newbury and winter privilege meetings held\n\n1788 – Newbury becomes the Town of Brookfield\n\n1801 – The first Post Office in Brookfield was established\n\n1876 – The second Town Hall built and the building is now the Brookfield Museum and Historical Society\n\n1888 – Brookfield celebrates its 100th birthday\n\n1915 – Electricity was brought to Brookfield Center\n\n1926 – Candlewood Lake was built\n\n1938 – Consolidated School built and is now called Center School.\n\n1951 – First Town Library established and is called Joyce Memorial Library\n\n1955 – Lake Lillinonah was built\n\n1966 – Present Huckleberry Hill School built\n\n1967 – First High School Graduation held at Brookfield High School\n\n1970 – Present Whisconier School built\n\n1983 – Current Town Hall built, along with the Police Station and Community Center\n\nVocabulary List\n\nApprentice – A person who learns a skill by working for a craftsperson.\n\nBarter – To trade by exchanging goods or services without using money.\n\nBeekeeper – Regulates the keeping of bees and their hives.\n\nBeehive Oven – An oven that is either in the back of a fireplace or to the side that was used for baking in colonial times.\n\nBlacksmith – Someone that makes horseshoes and iron items.\n\nCabinetmaker – A person who makes furniture.\n\nCarding Mill – A place where wool or cotton is brushed, cleaned and straightened out.\n\nCharter – A document that forms a government for a group of people, a state or a town.\n\nCobbler – Makes and repairs shoes.\n\nCollector of Town Rate – A person that sets the tax rate and estimates the wealth of all the town’s people.\n\nConstables – Are people that make sure that all people obey the laws.

The books numbered 6 to 12 are about the history of Brookfield Connecticut.\n\nBenjamin Hawley is buried in the Old South Cemetery on Sunset Hill Road. Benjamin Hawley served, along with three other Brookfield Residents in a Connecticut Regiment during the French and Indian War. They are the first of hundreds upon hundreds of us; Brookfield Residents, who answered our Nation’s call and very fine company to the thousands upon thousands of us who maintained the Town and sustained the American Spirit in their absence.\n\nIn the course of our Nation’s history, our government has made sixty-nine calls asking its people to defend both its national and its international principals or interests. Some of those people took death so that others could enjoy liberty. We won our independence from perhaps the largest and most powerful empire in history. We fought against our brothers to hold together a fragile union of state governments. We carried a big stick and defended a hemisphere from foreign intervention. We gave greatly of ourselves to make the world safe for democracy. We defended ourselves when we were invaded. We fought to stem the spread of an alien form of government. We gave of ourselves to insure that others may enjoy the same basic freedoms that we regularly enjoy. We gave, and are still giving, our lives to protect our borders from the terrible consequences of militant beliefs. And in all the days between the givings; men and women defended our Nation against an attack by reason of their participation in a strong standing armed force.\n\nThey are not invisible, these people. They are our Moms and Dads. They are our brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces, and nephews. They are our friends and our neighbors. They are any and all of us. Some were students when they left us. Some were farmers. Some pumped our gas, jerked our sodas, blacktopped our roads, or owned the local Grocery store. They made our hats and sold us our clothes. They were our teachers, our dentist, doctor, or lawyer. They dug our wells, strung the telephone wires, cut our hair, and built our homes. They are the everybodys we meet every time we walk down our street or shop in our stores, and the first ones we call when we need something fixed. They are the people who put the life in our Town.\n\nAnd in their leaving they became the airplane mechanic, the bombardier, torpedoist, cannoneer, radio operator, or the bugler. They piloted single engine plans. The piloted two engine planes, jet planes, and the huge cargo planes. They were the navigators that guided the planes through war’s darkness and the parachutists who dropped out of that same darkness. They were the seaman, the yeoman, the coxswain, and the commander of large ships. They carried small weapons, automatic rifles, machine guns, or manned the anti-aircraft machine guns. They became a draftsperson, an offset pressperson, a secretary, clerk, and logistics officer. They operated nuclear propulsion plants, light and heavy trucks, and tanks. They are the nurse, the medical technician, the doctor, and the anesthesiologist. They drew maps, studied imagery, encrypted secret messages, and defused explosive ordinance. They are the musician, weather observer, personnel officer, and the chaplain. Where once they were our town, they became the integral members or the life of a different kind of entity. They are the strength who fight in wars, the peacekeepers in foreign countries, the deterrents of future wars, and the humanitarians who are there for people who suffer in natural and sometimes unnatural disasters.\n\nThey fought in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. They fought at Antietam Creek in Maryland and Cedar Creek in Virginia. They occupied the trenches at Chateau-Thierry and Aisne Marne in France. They fought to establish beach-heads at Normandy, at Guam, Sicily, Guadalcanal, Okinawa, Saipan and Iwo Jima. They fought throughout Europe, in Africa, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Somalia, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq. They saw combat in seventy-seven major battle theaters throughout the world. They served in occupied Germany and Japan, and are still serving in Korea. They patrolled every body of water on our earth including our own harbors.\n\nThey fought and served with a distinction that is a measure of themselves and a reflection of the values of our Town. They have been awarded the World War II Victory Ribbon, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, the Pre-Pearl Harbor Ribbon, and the Naval Fleet Marine Force Ribbon. They were awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Viet Nam Cross of Gallantry, Legion of Merit, and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. They won the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps Service Medal, and forty-three Brookfield Residents were awarded the Purple Heart. They were awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. They earned the Humanitarian Service Medal, the American Spirit Honor Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, and the Berlin Airlift Device.\n\nSome of our veterans were born and raised in Brookfield. Other Veterans honored us by moving to Brookfield after their term of service was completed. They came to us from California to the west, Georgia to the south, from Maine to our north and many States in between. Some were born in Germany, in England, India, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Ireland, Venezuela, Chile, Hungary, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey, and Syria. They were Veterans of the United States Armed Forces. Others served their country of origin before moving to Brookfield. One flew a fighter plane for the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Battle of Britain. One fought for our ally, the Italian Army during World War I.\n\nEach of the 3500 Brookfield Residents who served in the State Militia, The Army Air Corps, the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard, Merchant Marines, and the National Guard has his or her own story, and each story told, waiting to be told, or living in its deed; is an important and integral part of Brookfield’s history."
