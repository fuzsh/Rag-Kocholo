        "text": "The Center for Architecture is preparing to celebrate Common Bond: The Center for Architecture Gala on Thursday, October 28, 2021. Formerly known as the Heritage Ball, Common Bond serves as the Center for Architecture’s single largest funding source, allowing the organization and its partner, AIA New York, to fulfill their mission to educate the public about the value of architecture and design. Besides offering a unique opportunity for professional networking, the event provides critical funding for the exhibitions, programs, scholarships and activities of the Center for Architecture, including our popular K-12 education programs. Consider supporting the event by purchasing a sponsorship, ticket, or ad by October 14.\n\nThis year, Common Bond will be returning to Chelsea Piers, providing an opportunity for our supporters to connect and celebrate our honorees in person. In order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and staff, capacity for this event will be reduced by 50%. Opportunities for virtual participation are also available.\n\nWe are delighted to introduce you to this year’s honorees, all of whom have worked tirelessly to transform New York City into a better, more equitable city.\n\nGale A.

She has also spearheaded community planning initiatives to address development and zoning issues.\n\nIn 2018, Brewer served as Chair of the Large Cities Council of the National League of Cities.
