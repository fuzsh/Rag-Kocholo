        "text": "Brookfield Power New York Finance LP (BPNY), indirectly owned by Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (Brookfield Renewable), is issuing US$305 million of senior secured notes in December 2017. Proceeds of the offering will be used to refinance its existing indebtedness at Erie Boulevard, a portfolio of 78 hydroelectric facilities with an installed capacity of 872 MW located in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. The notes have a 13-year bullet maturity in 2030. The notes are callable at any time in whole or part. Given that Erie Boulevard generates 100% of its electricity through hydro resources, we consider the entire offering to be applied to green energy projects.\n\nDownload"
