Audience members will be socially-distanced as they move through the installation, where they will see some of the most powerful articulators of our time reflect upon our world today.\n\nAdult Content Disclaimer:\n\nA Dozen Dreams is not appropriate for small children. There is adult language and some references to violence. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate strollers in the installation.\n\nAll events and activations at Brookfield Place adhere to New York State regulations to ensure the safety of the public and staff.\n\nThe Designers:\n\nVisual and Environment Design: Irina Kruzhilina\n\nSound Design: Rena Anakwe\n\nVideo/ Projection Design: Brittany Bland\n\nLighting Design: Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew\n\nPictured left to right: Irina Kruzhilina, Brittany Bland, Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew, Rena Anakwe\n\nThe Playwrights:\n\nSam Chanse, Erika Dickerson-Despenza, Martyna Majok, Emily Mann with singer Kecia Lewis, Ellen McLaughlin, Rehana Mirza, Mona Mansour, Liza Jessie Peterson, Ren Dara Santiago, Caridad Svich, Andrea Thome, and Lucy Thurber\n\nProduction and Technical Direction: Tech Without Tears\n\nProduction Manager: Jenny Beth Snyder\n\nTechnical Director: Aaron Gonzalez\n\nAssociate Scenic & Environment Designer: Abby Smith\n\nProps Designer: Jessica Sovronsky\n\nAssistant Sound Designer & Programmer: Margaret Montagna\n\nAssociate Video Designer: Christopher Evans\n\nAssistant Lighting Designer: Christina Tang\n\nMaster Electrician: Joe D’Emilio\n\nSound Supervisor: Mike Deyo\n\nVideo Supervisor: Joey Moro\n\nVideo Programmer: Stivo Arnoczy\n\nScenic Intern: Gaya Chatterjee\n\nGeneral Manager: Amanda Cooper\n\nAbout the Creators:\n\nAnne Hamburger (creator and co-conceiver) Anne Hamburger is the founder and Artistic Director of En Garde Arts which she began in 1985.
