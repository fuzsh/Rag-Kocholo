A passionate advocate for conservative ideology and common-sense governance, Borelli is dedicated to improving the quality of life for residents of his home borough and the city as a whole. He was instrumental in the successful fight to eradicate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from public school buildings; coordinated the development of several Park and Rides to improve commutes for his constituents; secured $50 million for new building for special needs students at PS37/Great Kills High School; spearheaded the transformation of the former Brookfield Landfill to a clean 287-acre park; has worked with the Parks Department to complete the construction and major renovations of several parks on Staten Island; and most recently authored and passed legislation that will lower the financial burden for homeowners to replace trees.

Throughout his career in state and city government, Borelli has also been a leader in the movement for property tax reform, and lower tolls, taxes and fees, and an unwavering supporter of law enforcement officers.

First elected to represent the 51st Council District in a special election in November 2015, Borelli was re-elected to his first full term in November 2017 and to a second full term in November 2021.
