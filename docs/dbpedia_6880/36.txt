Early Life and Background

Born Anne McCarty in Louisville, Kentucky in 1924, Anne Braden came from a privileged background. Growing up in a racially segregated society, Braden witnessed firsthand the injustices and inequalities faced by African Americans. It was during her time at Randolph-Macon Women’s College that she joined various progressive groups and became exposed to the ideas of racial and social equality.

Following her graduation, Braden embarked on a career in journalism, working for the Louisville Times. She used her platform to report on the racial inequalities perpetuated by Jim Crow laws, hoping to raise awareness and provoke change.

Married to Carl Braden, a fellow activist, Anne Braden’s dedication to civil rights was solidified when the couple purchased a house in a segregated neighborhood, intending to sell it to an African American family.
