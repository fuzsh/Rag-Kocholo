        "text": "Interviewer: Did they flood the neighborhood? Aaron: No. They didnât flood the neighborhood. They didnât flood the neighborhood. What they did was they had this helicopter flying around shining big old lights on everybody. They had cordoned off the neighborhood for blocks away. They did not just move in. They had the neighborhood cordoned off. It took a while before they moved in with police force. Thirty minutes to an hour before they actually moved in there. Interviewer: Were you there at the time? Aaron: Yeah, I was there. Interviewer: Did the police shoot at you? Aaron: Yeah, they shot at me. They were shooting what you call tracer bullets. Bullets thatâll light up. They shot Carl with a dumdum. These boys on the roof of the church, they were the only ones doing the shooting. They had a tactical advantage on us because you could barely see them on top of that church, but they could see us. We down on the ground, you know, with lights and streetlights and all that shit. They got the helicopter flying around putting that light on you. So, they had us at a tacticalâthey had a tactical advantage on us. Interviewer: So Carl passes (inaudible) transition, why did you becomeâor, what happens after that? Aaron: After that, we all in disarray. Weâre all heartbroken. Our leaderâwhich he was the leader. Heartbroken. Discombobulated. Figured we need to keep the struggle going, the party going. I was one of the oldest members in the party. I was one of the earlier recruits. I had the title of field marshal at that time. I was one of the earlier recruits, so the brothers in the party elected me to that position. Interviewer: What did you do as a leader? Aaron: What I did was try to keep it together. I did the same work that everybody else did. Some of the decision-making fell on my shoulders. I basically did the same thing that the rest of them did outside of making a few decisions about this or that. Interviewer: Did the Peopleâs Party Two stay as the Peopleâs Party Two or did it change names? Aaron: We stayed as the Peopleâs Party Two for a year, maybe two. We always considered ourselves to be the Black Panthers even when we were Peopleâs Party Two. We considered ourselves to be Black Panthers. Thatâs who we emulated. Thatâs whoâthatâs the program we had, the Black Panther program. Thatâs the leadership we adhered too. (inaudible) So, we considered ourselves to be Black Panthers even when we was Peopleâs Party Two. We had the name Peopleâs Party because at the time, they wasnât organizing no more chapters of the Black Panther Party. Carl decides to call it Peopleâs Party Two. Peopleâs Party Two because he recognized the Black Panther Party as Peopleâs Party One. We stayed Peopleâs Party Two for a couple years, a year or two, until Hughie Newton got out of jail. We communicated with the party and asked to become an official chapter and we was given permission to do that. Became an official chapter of the Black Panther Party. Interviewer: What year was theâ Aaron: I believe it was aboutâCarl got killed in 1970. Might have been about 1972. Something like that. Nineteen seventy-one, 1972. It wasnât a long time after Carl got killed and one of the things I really regret is Carl, he did not live to see Hughie Newton. Hughie was an idol to him. Shortly after Carl got killed, Hughie Newton got out of prison. I regretted that happened like that. Carl would have just loved to be on the streets when Hughie got out, but he wasnât."
