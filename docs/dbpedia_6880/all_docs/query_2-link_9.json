        "text": "SUBVERSIVE SOUTHERNER\n\nAnne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South.\n\nBy Catherine Fosl.\n\nIllustrated. 418 pp. New York:\n\nPalgrave Macmillan. $35.\n\nAS long as the cold war was on, historians made scant acknowledgment of how many of the ends, means and participants in the civil rights movement came out of the American left of the New Deal era. In the 1930's, mass demonstrations, ''We Shall Overcome'' and even the term ''civil rights'' as a synonym for black equality were hallmarks of an elastic network of liberals, labor unionists and, yes, Communists that was redbaited into oblivion by a familiar cast of subversive-hunters: J. Edgar Hoover, Southern legislators, the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nCatherine Fosl's ''Subversive Southerner'' is the first full-length biography of Anne Braden, a ubiquitous yet elusive white activist who rallied the fractured remnants of that Old Left coalition to the battlefronts of civil rights in the 1950's and 60's. She was one of the movement's major minor figures: an influence on Martin Luther King Jr., a den mother to the young radicals in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and, thanks to her background in journalism, a talented publicist and propagandist for the movement.\n\nBraden's subversiveness was all the more striking for how picturesquely southern she was. Born in Kentucky in 1924, she was raised in fading gentility in Anniston, Ala. Bluestocking vying with belle, she embarked on a promising career as a journalist after graduating from a respected Virginia women's college. It was during the mid-1940's, while covering the courts in ultrasegregated Birmingham, Ala., that Braden became disgusted with the racial status quo. She bolted Birmingham for a job at The Louisville Times, where she found her mentor and husband, Carl Braden, a second-generation socialist named after Karl Marx. The 24-year-old Anne's own initiation into political activism was working on Henry Wallace's Progressive Party campaign for president in 1948, the last hurrah of the old American left."
