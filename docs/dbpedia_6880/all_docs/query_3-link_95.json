        "text": "Carla F. Wallace born Prospect, Ky., (1957- ) is a Louisville Kentucky activist. Ms. Wallace led a successful effort in 1999 as part of the Fairness Campaign to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under Louisville's Human Rights Ordinance. In 2002 she was arrested for protesting the fatal police shooting in Louisville of a handcuffed man. The Late activist Anne Braden has called Ms. Wallace one of the best civil rights organizers Louisville produced during the 20th century.[1]\n\nBackground\n\nCarla Wallace grew up on a farm in Oldham County, Ky., and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where her grandmother had hidden people resisting the Nazis under her floorboards during World War II. She has been engaged in social justice work since she was a child, joining her father in efforts to end racial segregation in Louisville’s theaters. Her work as an adult has included international human rights, affordable housing and police misconduct. She is a founder of Louisville’s Fairness Campaign, (her late father, Henry F. Wallace it's largest benefactor) which has been honored locally and nationally for its inclusive justice framework and for winning some of the most inclusive protections for LGBTQ people in the country. Wallace is a founding member of the national network Showing Up for Racial Justice, which was organized in the wake of the racial backlash to the election of the first black U.S. president.\n\nShe helped establish the Audre Lorde Chair in Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality at the University of Louisville and co-chairs the Community Council of the University’s Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research. Her work has recently been included in a new book, Towards Collective Liberation, by Chris Crass.[2]\n\nShameka supporters\n\nShameka L.

Five of the Southerners On New Ground co-founders were there. Joan Garner was the only one missing, but was soon identified as someone to involve, and we had the first SONG planning meeting [after Creating Change], in January 1994, at her house in Atlanta. Another person who was not a SONG co-founder but was there at Creating Change and was really instrumental in the start of SONG, was Carla Wallace, from Louisville [part of Alliance Against Women’s Oppression and the Fairness Campaign]. All of us had done multi-issue work in our communities, and done that work as out lesbians, and had strong ties to wide movements—the women’s movement, anti-racism.

October 17, 2016.\n\nA lot of us see something really clearly, but few of us—radical and revolutionary organizers—are willing to say it out loud.\n\nSo we’re going to say it. Defeating Trump in the presidential election is a top priority for the left. And at a minimum, that means mobilizing voters for Hillary Clinton in swing states even if you vote for another candidate in a safe state. We’ve got to beat Trump and Trumpism while building movements that will fight, resist and disrupt a Clinton administration that will be militaristic and pro-corporate...\n\nAs we mentioned at the beginning, defeating Trump is not enough. We need movements strong enough to fight a Clinton administration on several fronts—whether Israel/Palestine, free trade agreements, climate change, a $15 minimum wage, or the prison-industrial complex. And neutralizing the appeal of the far right means we need to both strengthen our movements for racial justice and win over white workers to a progressive class politics as an alternative to Trump’s racist economic nationalism. Finally, we need to build a left that can help anchor a visionary alternative to corporate Democrats. It won’t be easy, but we’ve come this far. Let’s defend what we’ve got in this election, and keep our eye on collective liberation.\n\nSignatories included Carla Wallace, Showing Up for Racial Justice Action, Inc.\n\nFight Back for Human Rights\n\nCarla Wallace January 15, 2018:\n\nGood to be here at Saint Williams Catholic Church with Richard Becker, Pam McMichael and other listening to Emcee Shameka Parrish-Wright lead us in a call to honor the Fight Back for Human Rights. — with [Richard Becker (Kentucky)[Richard Becker]]."
