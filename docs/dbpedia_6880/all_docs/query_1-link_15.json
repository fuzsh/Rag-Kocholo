        "text": "Anne McCarty Braden (July 28, 1924 – March 6, 2006) of Kentucky was the wife of Carl Braden.\n\nEarly life\n\nAnne Braden was born Anne McCarty on July 28, 1924, in Louisville, Kentucky, but spent most of her childhood in Anniston, Alabama, \"raised by middle-class parents who were firm believers in racial hierarchy. A devout Episcopalian, she studied literature and journalism at a Virginia women's college, then worked as a newspaper reporter in postwar Alabama, where she was \"repelled by its blatantly discriminatory justice system.\" Returning to the border city of her birth, she joined the staff of the Louisville Times in 1947.\"[1]\n\nRadicalization\n\nCovering civil rights causes and meeting radical reformers for the first time, she experienced a dramatic political transformation. She met and in 1948 married fellow newspaperman and labor editor Carl Braden, a leftist trade unionist. Becoming an activist team, the Bradens left mainstream journalism to apply their writing talents to the interracial left wing of Louisville's labor movement.[2]\n\nWade case\n\nIn 1954, a week before the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, Anne Braden and Carl Braden bought a house in an all-white neighborhood for a black couple, Andrew and Charlotte Wade, who were unable to purchase it due to racial restrictions in real estate. This act resulted in mob violence against the Wades and bombing of the house. Anne recounts: The Prosecuting Attorney said there were two theories. One was that the house was bombed by the neighbors to get rid of the Wades. The other was that this was all a communist plot to foment race hatred in order to overthrow the government of the state of Kentucky. Lewis Lubka, a member of the Wade Defense Committee, recalls being pulled before the Grand Jury and asked, out of the blue, \"Were you ever or are you now a member of the Communist Party?\"\n\nAlthough Carl Braden answered “No” he was found guilty of sedition and served 8 months of a 15 year sentence.\n\nFrom that point on the Bradens vowed never to give that question legitimacy by answering it.[3]\n\nNational Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee\n\nAs of May 1964, Anne Braden, editor, Southern Patriot, was listed as a sponsor of the Communist Party USA front, National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nRosa Parks connection\n\nAmerican Committee for Protection of Foreign Born\n\nIn the late 1960s Anne Braden was listed as a Sponsor of American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born[4].\n\nExpel South Africa From the UN\n\nThe Campaign for One Million Voices to Expel South Africa From the UN was a Communist Party USA front created in about 1974.[5] The front was launched to speak on South Africa and its membership in the United Nations.
