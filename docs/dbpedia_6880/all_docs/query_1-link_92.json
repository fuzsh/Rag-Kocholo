The article says \"Medicine runs on an unspoken social contract in which medical professionals expect themselves to sacrifice their own well-being for their patients.\"\n\nThis is true for those who do the actual work and whose numbers have been \"rightsized\" aka cut to the bone even before the pandemic and whose salaries are stagnant or declining, but not true of the layers of hospital administrators, pharma CEOs and reps, insurance company gatekeepers and other suits, extortionists, profiteers and bean counters. The privatized, for-profit medical system has become a giant expensive top-heavy Byzantine structure. We need to stop eroding Medicare, and focus on expanding and improving it.

This stems from their conflation of compulsory arbitration of individual cases in a business setting with binding arbitration that almost all union contracts have. The former is structured to have many inherent imbalances between the rights of workers and the economic power of employers. In compulsory arbitration, for example, the company hires and pays the arbitrators, who then of course are beholden to the company.\n\nUnder union contracts' arbitration provisions, the employer and the union jointly select and compensate arbitrators. In that setup, the arbitrators are not tied to the employer in any way more than they are tied to the union. In addition, the article creates a misleading impression of the essence of labor arbitration in stating that\n\n\"The process of forced arbitration moves complaints out of court and into a separate mediation process...\" The bottom line in union arbitration is that the arbitrator issues an award that is \"final and binding\", and is enforceable in court should the employer not comply. It's also not a reflection of real life circumstances to state, \"Kim’s office and workers’ advocates expressed concerns that such a large settlement would limit the possibility for recourse, as it would spread any monetary compensation payments over a vast number of workers.\"\n\nIt's true that a victory in a large class action may result in modest payments to individuals, since the money is spread thin. But in the real world, it is not the case that thousands of workers who have their rights violated litigate so that they can win what they are owed. The institutional barriers -- the cost of hiring an attorney, even understanding where to go for relief -- are high enough so that very few workers use the courts to enforce their rights.\n\nIn contrast, what unions offer is a way for workers, who may not understand the legal maze they need to navigate nor have the resources to do so, can have their rights fought for by their union. None of this is to be taken as a defense of how SEIU has handled any of this. I don't know nearly enough about the specifics to opine on that. But the point is that having final and binding arbitration in a collective bargaining agreement is often the only realistic way for workers' rights to be defended.\n\nMike Mauer\n\nPosted on Portside's Facebook page\n\nRe: The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the World's Future\n\nsuperb piece. i remember years back at Vassar when the author was initiating quality written and oral materials and we were in awe. don't stop now or ever!\n\nSondra Farganis\n\nRe: Thomas Piketty: The Making of a Socialist\n\n(posting on Portside Culture)\n\nFor all the liberals who praised this book as “revolutionary work”.\n\nDorothy Payne\n\nPosted on Portside's Facebook page\n\n=====\n\nKuttner review is good & brief.

Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin asks \"Why?\" It presents a vivid drama, intermingling the personal and the political, about one of the most enigmatic figures in 20th-century American history. One of the first \"freedom riders,\" an adviser to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and A. Philip Randolph, organizer of the March on Washington, intelligent, gregarious and charismatic, Bayard Rustin was denied his place in the limelight for one reason – he was gay.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 15: Click here to register to receive an email with the full program and instructions on how to watch the films and join the webinar.\n\nLove and Solidarity: Rev.

In the 1950's, in the height if the cold war, Anne and Carl Braden bought a house for a Black family in a white neighborhood.

This fittingly happens on week after the Martin Luther King holiday and just preceding Black History Month. Please join us.

She has made documentary films since the 1970¹s and was associate director and assistant camerawoman for HARLAN COUNTY, USA. Other work includes: Fast Food Women, Morristown: in the air and sun, and A Strike and an Uprising in Texas. Anne partnered with Mimi Pickering and Appalshop to make Anne Braden: Southern Patriot. For more information about Anne go to www.annelewis.org\n\nCatherine Fosl: \"I’m a historian and a professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Louisville, where I was also founding director of the Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research. I’m the author of three books on social movement history, including an award winning biography of Anne Braden entitled Subversive Southerner: Anne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South (Univ. of Kentucky Press, 2006).\"\n\nJim Williams: a native Louisvillian, met Carl and Anne Braden in 1962. He was soon writing for The Southern Patriot and working closely with Carl and Anne, who assisted the formation of the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC). He frequently accompanied Carl on his organizing trips. “Anne never forgave me for leaving Louisville,” he says\n\nIra Grupper: Civil Rights worker in 1960’s: NYC, Georgia and Mississippi (SNCC—Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; COFO—Council of Federated Orgs.; MFDP—Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party). His distinguished civil rights jail record in the 1960’s spans both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. Moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1969 to join the staff of SCEF, the Southern Conference Educational Fund (at the request of its Executive Directors, Carl and Anne Braden).\n\nWhen the civil rights struggle engulfed the South, Anne Braden was one of the courageous few who crossed the color line to fight for racial justice. Her history is a proud and fascinating one…Anne Braden is indeed a ‘subversive southerner’—a label she can wear with pride because she spent her life fighting to build a New South, where all our people could live together in freedom and equality.”\n\n~ Rev.

But on-camera labor is only the beginning of the story. Porn Work takes readers behind the scenes to explore what porn performers think of their work and how they intervene to hack it. Blending extensive fieldwork with feminist and antiwork theorizing, Porn Work details entrepreneurial labor on the boundaries between pleasure and tedium. Rejecting any notion that sex work is an aberration from straight work, it reveals porn workers' creative strategies as prophetic of a working landscape in crisis. In the end, it looks to what porn has to tell us about what's wrong with work, and what it might look like to build something better.\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nHeather Berg writes about sex, work, and social struggle. Her first book, Porn Work (UNC Press, 2021), explores workers' strategies for navigating--and subverting--precarity. Her writing appears in the journals Feminist Studies, Signs, South Atlantic Quarterly, and others. Heather is assistant professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nLisa Duggan is a journalist, activist, and Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis at New York University. She is author most recently of Mean Girl: Ayn Rand and Neoliberal Greed as well of Sapphic Slashers: Sex, Sensationalism and American Modernity, and Twilight of Equality? Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics and the Attack on Democracy. She is co-author with Nan Hunter of Sex Wars: Sexual Dissent and Political Culture, and co-editor with Lauren Berlant of Our Monica, Ourselves: The Clinton Affair and National Interest.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Tamiment Library & Robert F.
