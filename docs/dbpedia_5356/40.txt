DONALD M. GRANT, PUBLISHER, INC. is proud to announce the publication of Christina Rossetti’s GOBLIN MARKET, lavishly interpreted by award winning artist Omar Rayyan.

Over one hundred drawings and watercolor paintings are packed into this 88 page full color book. 10 x 12 inches, hardcover with a printed dust jacket and an introduction written by Charles Vess. Omar signed a number of books for us and these are available while they last at no extra cost.

Goblin Market” was written by Christina Rossetti and first published in 1862. The poem is teeming with imagery and symbolism, true to the nature of the Pre-Raphaelite era in which it was written. It is about two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, who are enticed by the calls of the goblin merchants, who sell fruits in fantastic abundance, variety and flavor. Laura succumbs to the temptation of the forbidden fruits, and Lizzie tries to help her fallen sister.
