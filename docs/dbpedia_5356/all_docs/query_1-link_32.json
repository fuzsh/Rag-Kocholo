        "text": "During the recession last decade, the University of Rhode Island (URI) lost $26 million in state support over a three-year period. That loss represented about a third of its state appropriation, posing a major threat to URI’s future. But the university used its budget crisis as a spur to revamp undergraduate education and focus on increasing student progress and graduation rates.\n\nNow, ten years later, URI has turned things around, and although it has yet to recover all its lost funding, it has achieved results that are nothing short of remarkable. In recognition, it was one of three 2019 finalists for the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities degree-completion award.\n\nAmong the improvements, reported last month in the Chronicle of Higher Education, URI has:\n\nIncreased enrollment by 9%, adding millions in tuition revenue to its budget;\n\nImproved first-to-second year retention rate to 86%, a nine percentage point increase;\n\nRaised the on-time graduation rate (today more than half of URI undergrads earn a degree within four years, 14% more than a decade ago);\n\nCut its racial-achievement gap in half;\n\nHired more than 50 new faculty members.\n\nHow Did URI Do It?\n\nThe University’s transformation involved a host of changes, made after a lengthy, sometimes contentious study of detailed data about the curriculum and student success. Four areas were emphasized — intensified student advising, increased financial aid, revamped general education requirements and reallocated internal budgets — all with the purpose of improving degree completion.\n\nStudent advising. URI strengthened its student advising, hiring new professional advisors and drawing up degree maps that chart the degree-completion pathway for each student. Another focus was advising students to earn more credits in their first two years in school. About 75% of entering students now earn 30 or more credits in their first year (compared to 45% in 2008), and more than two-thirds complete 60 or more credits by the end of their sophomore year.\n\nThe university also added a new mini-semester over winter break and more online courses throughout the year, making it easier for students who had fallen behind schedule to catch up.\n\nFinancial aid. The university made tough decisions to reallocate funds internally so it could invest additional dollars in financial aid, thereby enabling more students to persist even in the face of financial pressures to drop out. Over the years URI has added $24 million in financial aid.\n\nIt also discovered the value of targeted, just-in-time grants that help students in financial jeopardy. For example, URI removed the registration holds placed on students who owed the university money. Holds were lifted for those owing less than $1,000, and aid was given to students owing more than that amount so they could meet that cutoff.\n\nGeneral education overhaul. URI’s faculty senate retooled the general education curriculum, course by course. The results yielded several benefits for students. Every course now has expected competencies established for it, and as a result — unusual for general education courses — there’s an emphasis on practical skills in what are typically survey courses.\n\nThe new curriculum ensures that general-education courses count toward all majors. Quoted in an Inside Higher Education review of the program, Laura Beauvais, URI’s vice-provost for faculty affairs, said, “If it’s required, it’s part of the major. When a student finishes their gen-ed program, they have finished their gen-ed program.”\n\nIn other words, at URI, unlike many universities, a general-education course counts toward any major’s requirements, so students don’t have to complete a different introductory course specific to a major. And students don’t lose any credits as a result of changing majors.\n\nBudget reallocations.\n\nUltimately convinced by the data of the importance of improving student performance, URI’s leadership decided to reallocate from its operating budget each year to the various success initiatives.\n\nURI — like many institutions — had permitted individual colleges and departments to retain the salary savings generated each year when faculty retired or left the university. This kind of budgeting is popular with academic units because it provides them an annual pot of discretionary money for their unique use.\n\nBut Donald DeHayes, URI Provost, introduced a plan whereby units had to compete each year for the salary savings. Now, rather than allowing units to hold their surpluses, the money is awarded to colleges showing enrollment growth or departments considering a new program with enrollment appeal.\n\nThe reallocations appear to be paying off. According to the Chronicle, “for every percentage-point percent increase in retention, the university gains more than $2 million in tuition revenue.” Over the past five years, URI has strategically reallocated almost $30 million.\n\nCan URI be a model for other universities facing decreasing appropriations or lagging student performance? That remains to be seen. Not every attempt to remake undergraduate education is successful. Witness Project 2021 at the University of Texas (UT), which was abandoned before it was fully implemented. To be sure the contexts were different — URI’s reforms were driven by financial necessity; UT’s were directed at teaching innovations and enhanced learning experiences. URI’s reworking was grounded in data; UT’s reinvention was guided by aspirations."
