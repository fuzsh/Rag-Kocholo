It's my go to recommendation for people wanting to read about that stuff. - @erbridge\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the ebook is available for free in a variety of formats on Stross's website. - @AlexKeyes\n\nDescription\n\nThe Singularity. It is the era of the posthuman. Artificial intelligences have surpassed the limits of human intellect. Biotechnological beings have rendered people all but extinct. Molecular nanotechnology runs rampant, replicating and reprogramming at will. Contact with extraterrestrial life grows more imminent with each new day.\n\nStruggling to survive and thrive in this accelerated world are three generations of the Macx clan: Manfred, an entrepreneur dealing in intelligence amplification technology whose mind is divided between his physical environment and the Internet; his daughter, Amber, on the run from her domineering mother, seeking her fortune in the outer system as an indentured astronaut; and Sirhan, Amber's son, who finds his destiny linked to the fate of all of humanity.\n\nFor something is systemically dismantling the nine planets of the solar system. Something beyond human comprehension. Something that has no use for biological life in any form.\n\nThis intense linguistic thriller will change the way you think about language. - @helderroem\n\nDescription\n\nBabel-17 is all about the power of language. Humanity, which has spread throughout the universe, is involved in a war with the Invaders, who have been covertly assassinating officials and sabotaging spaceships. The only clues humanity has to go on are strange alien messages that have been intercepted in space. Poet and linguist Rydra Wong is determined to understand the language and stop the alien threat.\n\nNow more than a century old, has that unique writing style you can only find in adventure classics. - @uraimo\n\nBooks:\n\nA Princess of Mars [3.8]\n\nThe Gods of Mars [3.8]\n\nThe Warlord of Mars [3.8]\n\nThuvia, Maid of Mars [3.7]\n\nThe Chessmen of Mars [3.7]\n\nThe Master Mind of Mars [3.8]\n\nA Fighting Man of Mars [3.8]\n\nSwords of Mars [4.0]\n\nSynthetic Men of Mars [3.8]\n\nLlana of Gathol [3.7]\n\nJohn Carter of Mars [3.8]\n\nDescription\n\nBarsoom is planet Mars from American Edgar Rice Burroughs. First serialized as Under the Moons of Mars in 1912, published as A Princess of Mars in 1917. Dying Mars was based on outdated scientific ideas of canals. The savage, frontier world has honor, noble sacrifice and constant struggle, where martial prowess is paramount and races fight over dwindling resources.\n\nLike Accelerando, this series is an excellent exploration of posthumanism. It also has themes of space exploration, references to various other series, and is all around a great amount of fun to read. It's also free if you have kindle unlimited. - @AlexKeyes\n\nDescription\n\nBob Johansson has just sold his software company and is looking forward to a life of leisure. There are places to go, books to read, and movies to watch. So it's a little unfair when he gets himself killed crossing the street.\n\nBob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state. He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he'll be switched off, and they'll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty.\n\nThe safest place for Bob is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad.\n\nThis book is interesting for its view of what a golden age of mankind would look like, and what would the shortcomings of that be. It also has a very interesting take on mass psychology - I don't want to give away too much, but the Overlords are a nifty bunch. This is a good early Clarke, and has two of his favorite themes; the first that remote work will be possible with technology, and the second that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nWithout warning, giant silver ships from deep space appear in the skies above every major city on Earth. Manned by the Overlords, in fifty years, they eliminate ignorance, disease, and poverty. Then this golden age ends‚Äîand then the age of Mankind begins‚Ä¶\n\nThis is a long book, but absolutely fantastic. It redefined for me the scale at which science fiction was possible, especially given the human elements are very fleshed out (as opposed to other massive space epics, like Olaf Stapledon's 'Last and First Men'). A brilliant look at the future, going off of only two small changes - what if we had drugs to defeat death, and cities could fly. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nOriginally published in four volumes nearly fifty years ago, Cities in Flight brings together the famed ‚ÄúOkie novels‚Äù of science fiction master James Blish. Named after the migrant workers of America‚Äôs Dust Bowl, these novels convey Blish‚Äôs ‚Äúhistory of the future,‚Äù a brilliant and bleak look at a world where cities roam the Galaxy looking for work and a sustainable way of life.\n\nIn the first novel, They Shall Have Stars, man has thoroughly explored the Solar System, yet the dream of going even further seems to have died in all but one man. His battle to realize his dream results in two momentous discoveries anti-gravity and the secret of immortality. In A Life for the Stars, it is centuries later and antigravity generations have enabled whole cities to lift off the surface of the earth to become galactic wanderers. In Earthman, Come Home, the nomadic cities revert to barbarism and marauding rogue cities begin to pose a threat to all civilized worlds. In the final novel, The Triumph of Time, history repeats itself as the cities once again journey back in to space making a terrifying discovery which could destroy the entire Universe. A serious and haunting vision of our world and its limits, Cities in Flight marks the return to print of one of science fiction‚Äôs most inimitable writers.\n\nBased on Sagan's own studies as an astrophysicist and philosopher, Contact provides a possible glimpse of the world's reaction to extraterrestrial life - @augustopedro\n\nDescription\n\nAt first it seemed impossible - a radio signal that came not from Earth but from far beyond the nearest stars. But then the signal was translated, and what had been impossible became terrifying. For the signal contains the information to build a Machine that can travel to the stars. A Machine that can take a human to meet those that sent the message. They are eager to meet us: they have been watching and waiting for a long time. And now they will judge.\n\nAn interesting take on the possibility of the multiverse, Schr√∂dinger's cat, and how every choice, big or small, has led to this exact moment. - @thedeany\n\nDescription\n\nJason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie‚Äîwhen his reality shatters.\n\nIt starts with a man in a mask kidnapping him at gunpoint, for reasons Jason can‚Äôt begin to fathom‚Äîwhat would anyone want with an ordinary physics professor?‚Äîand grows even more terrifying from there, as Jason‚Äôs abductor injects him with some unknown drug and watches while he loses consciousness.\n\nWhen Jason awakes, he‚Äôs in a lab, strapped to a gurney‚Äîand a man he‚Äôs never seen before is cheerily telling him ‚Äúwelcome back!‚Äù\n\nJason soon learns that in this world he‚Äôs woken up to, his house is not his house. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born.\n\nAnd someone is hunting him.\n\nWhat a weird, funny and lovely little book. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nFred Cassidy, a perpetual student, scrounger, and acrophile, is the last known person to have seen an important stone that his friend had. Various criminals, Anglophile zealots, government agents and aliens torture, shoot, beat, trick, chase, terrorize, assault telepathically, stalk, and importune Fred in attempts to get him to tell them the location of the stone. He denies any knowledge of its whereabouts, and decides to make his own investigation.\n\nI think what is most fascinating about Dune isn't that it is so commonly read, but the ubiquity with which it is referenced. Once you read this, you start seeing Dune quotes everywhere. Dune is monumental in scope, and the cautionary tone in which it was written - this is what happens when you put faith in a single person trained scientifically - almost completely backfires in an amazing story of heroism, revenge, and reconciliation. A book worth reading multiple times. Of course, it is also a series - the first stands alone, and I haven't read beyond the first two. There almost isn't a need. Dune alone is that good. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nSet in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the ‚Äúspice‚Äù melange, the most important and valuable substance in the cosmos. The story explores the complex, multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology and human emotion, as the forces of the empire confront each other for control of Arrakis.\n\nPublished in 1965, it won the Hugo Award in 1966 and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the world‚Äôs best-selling SF novel.\n\nDescription\n\nIn the far future, humans have colonized a distant planet, home to the enigmatic Ariekei, sentient beings famed for a language unique in the universe, one that only a few altered human ambassadors can speak.\n\nAvice Benner Cho, a human colonist, has returned to Embassytown after years of deep-space adventure. She cannot speak the Ariekei tongue, but she is an indelible part of it, having long ago been made a figure of speech, a living simile in their language.\n\nWhen distant political machinations deliver a new ambassador to Arieka, the fragile equilibrium between humans and aliens is violently upset. Catastrophe looms, and Avice is torn between competing loyalties‚Äîto a husband she no longer loves, to a system she no longer trusts, and to her place in a language she cannot speak yet speaks through her.\n\nA series comprised (as of 2019) of eight full-length novels with a total of nine entries planned. Several shorts not relevant to the main plot also exist. Notable for this series is the attention to detail regarding the actual physics involved in space travel and the challenges of daily life outside a friendly biosphere. The narrative, which is told from the changing perspectives of a cast of diverse characters, offers a healthy mix of humor and suspension, making it an entertaining read. - @jpkempf\n\nThe books are real page turners with its mix of high politics, space battles, ancient mysteries, day-to-day grit and cultural differences, and the world Expanse starts out with really changes over the course of the books. You may find book four (Cibola Burn) a bit slow, but keep at it, subsequent books really pay dividends. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nHumanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.\n\nJim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, \"The Scopuli,\" they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.\n\nBooks:\n\nLeviathan Wakes [4.2] üî•\n\nCaliban's War [4.3] üî•\n\nAbaddon's Gate [4.2]\n\nCibola Burn [4.2]\n\nNemesis Games [4.4]\n\nBabylon's Ashes [4.2]\n\nPersepolis Rising [4.3]\n\nTiamat's Wrath [4.5]\n\nLeviathan Falls [4.5]\n\nThis book will teach you to stretch your imagination and see things in a different way. - @elssar\n\nDescription\n\nThis masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed readers for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women‚Äîthin, straight lines‚Äîare the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.\n\nThrough strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions‚Äîa revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space. ‚ÄúInstructive, entertaining, and stimulating to the imagination.‚Äù ‚Äî Mathematics Teacher\n\nThis book is often given to high school students, but stands up well as an adult read. I think the best part about it is what Charlie does once he starts being intelligent; he suddenly likes art and making things and scientific theory. I think the altruism and openness of that time shows that the experiment, such as it was, didn't change everything. It's fun to think about. Also, this book made me cry the first time I read it. I was 25. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nWith more than five million copies sold, Flowers for Algernon is the beloved, classic story of a mentally disabled man whose experimental quest for intelligence mirrors that of Algernon, an extraordinary lab mouse. In poignant diary entries, Charlie tells how a brain operation increases his IQ and changes his life. As the experimental procedure takes effect, Charlie‚Äôs intelligence expands until it surpasses that of the doctors who engineered his metamorphosis. The experiment seems to be a scientific breakthrough of paramount importance‚Äîuntil Algernon begins his sudden, unexpected deterioration. Will the same happen to Charlie?\n\nIsaac Asimov's original \"Foundation Trilogy\" is a mesmerizing voyage into the realm of science fiction, presenting a grand game of 4D chess spread over centuries, propelled by the innovative concept of 'psychohistory'. Its thought-provoking exploration of power, control, and inevitability underscores its status as a seminal piece in the pantheon of sci-fi literature. - @edoardodanna\n\nDescription\n\nFor twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Sheldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future‚Äîto a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire‚Äîboth scientists and scholars‚Äîand brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for a future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.\n\nBut soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankind‚Äôs last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun‚Äîor fight them and be destroyed.\n\nBooks:\n\nFoundation [4.2] üî•\n\nFoundation and Empire [4.2] üî•\n\nSecond Foundation [4.3] üî•\n\nArchetypal tale of mad science with the theme of 'how far can Science go' that arguably spawned the modern genre of Science Fiction. - @katamaritaco\n\nDescription\n\nMary Shelley began writing Frankenstein when she was only eighteen. At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, Frankenstein tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.\n\nFrankenstein, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bioterrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.\n\nDescription\n\nWhen Robin wakes up in a clinic with most of his memories missing, it doesn‚Äôt take him long to discover that someone is trying to kill him. It‚Äôs the twenty-seventh century, when interstellar travel is by teleport gate and conflicts are fought by network worms that censor refugees‚Äô personalities and target historians. The civil war is over and Robin has been demobilized, but someone wants him out of the picture because of something his earlier self knew.\n\nOn the run from a ruthless pursuer and searching for a place to hide, he volunteers to participate in a unique experimental polity, the Glasshouse, constructed to simulate a pre-accelerated culture. Participants are assigned anonymized identities: It looks like the ideal hiding place for a posthuman on the run. But in this escape-proof environment, Robin will undergo an even more radical change, placing him at the mercy of the experimenters‚Äîand at the mercy of his own unbalanced psyche‚Ä¶\n\nThis is a pretty good book. Like later Gene Wolfe books, it reads a bit dry, and the main character is sometimes one sided. But the context and the fleshed out world entirely make up for it, as does Gene Wolfe's standard of never mentioning an important detail more than once as a foreshadowing. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nGene Wolfe takes us to a future North America at once familiar and utterly strange. A young man and woman, Skip and Chelle, fall in love in college and marry, but she is enlisted in the military, there is a war on, and she must serve her tour of duty before they can settle down. But the military is fighting a war with aliens in distant solar systems, and her months in the service will be years in relative time on Earth. Chelle returns to recuperate from severe injuries, after months of service, still a young woman but not necessarily the same person‚Äîwhile Skip is in his forties and a wealthy businessman, but eager for her return.\n\nStill in love (somewhat to his surprise and delight), they go on a Caribbean cruise to resume their marriage. Their vacation rapidly becomes a complex series of challenges, not the least of which are spies, aliens, and battles with pirates who capture the ship for ransom. There is no writer in SF like Gene Wolfe and no SF novel like Home Fires.\n\nDescription\n\nJean le Flambeur gets up in the morning and has to kill himself before his other self can kill him first. Just another day in the Dilemma Prison. Rescued by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean is taken to the Oubliette, the Moving City of Mars, where time is a currency, memories are treasures, and a moon-turned-singularity lights the night. Meanwhile, investigator Isidore Beautrelet, called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur‚Ä¶\n\nThis book has a few beautiful passages. It deals mainly with the ethics of using alien species for nationalistic purposes, and for that alone was an interesting read. Like a lot of science fiction, I found it a bit hard to empathize with any particular characters, but it's a short read and worth it anyway. The politics are a bit dated. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nThe discovery of another habitable world might spell salvation to the three bitterly competing power blocs of the resource-starved 21st century; but when their representatives arrive on Jem, with its multiple intelligent species, they discover instead the perfect situation into which to export their rivalries. Subtitled, with savage irony, ‚ÄúThe Making of a Utopia‚Äù, Jem is one of Frederik Pohl‚Äôs most powerful novels.\n\nThis was like if Hermann Hesse decided he was tired of writing Steppenwolf and Siddhartha and wanted to do something interesting for a change. What a weird book. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nEarth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rule their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Only one dares oppose them: he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons, Lord of Light.\n\nThis book has a banger name. The story of a conman wizard who's not really a wizard, forced to travel to another planet in order to exorcize the demons of a ruined sister planet. John Jakes is more well known for his historical fiction, so it's interesting to read his take on a different genre. - @just-an-e\n\nDescription\n\nOn a post-apocalyptic world far from Earth, Magus Blacklaw, a traveling mountebank, is in trouble with the law. He and his daughter soon fall in with a young man, and pretty soon all three are condemned to ride a skysled to exorcize the demons of a formerly commercial sister planet.\n\nActually four books by two authors. It was made into a TV series but the books should be consumed instead. Very high quality over the top deep space trouble with anti-hero Lister and his crew. - @montao\n\nDescription\n\n...three million years from Earth, marooned in the wrong dimension of the wrong reality, and down to his last two cigarettes.\n\nAlthough each part can be read independently, the whole trilogy has a consistent story line which happens in a very huge time-space context and the first just a beginning. The later two are especially much more hardcore and dramatical, however, gloomy as well. While the first one got the Hugo Award, I'd like to say that it really worth a try for the whole trilogy, don't miss the later two. - @cp4\n\nBooks:\n\nThe Three-Body Problem [4.0] üî•\n\nThe Dark Forest [4.4]\n\nDeath's End [4.4]\n\nThis book is not just filled to the brim with interesting and novel ideas about technology and civilization, it also offers some really great insights into China and its recent history.\n\nDescription\n\nSet against the backdrop of China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.\n\nDescription\n\nIn The Dark Forest, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion ‚Äî four centuries in the future. The aliens' human collaborators have been defeated but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret.\n\nDescription\n\nNow this epic trilogy concludes with Death's End. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.\n\nThis book is filled with a quiet suspense that is almost palpable; in that, it does an extraordinary job of showing how humans respond to alien encounters. The otherworldliness of Rama isn't always interesting, but the reaction of the reader to it is. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nAt first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind‚Äôs first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams‚Ä¶ and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits‚Äîjust behind a Raman airlock door.\n\nTwitter user: One of the best books I have ever read.\n\nDescription\n\nRed Schuhart is a stalker, one of those strange misfits compelled to venture illegally into the Zone and collect the strange artifacts that the alien visitors left scattered there. His whole life, even the nature of his daughter, is determined by the Zone.\n\nDescription\n\nA classic work of science fiction by renowned Polish novelist and satirist Stanis≈Çaw Lem.\n\nWhen Kris Kelvin arrives at the planet Solaris to study the ocean that covers its surface, he finds a painful, hitherto unconscious memory embodied in the living physical likeness of a long-dead lover. Others examining the planet, Kelvin learns, are plagued with their own repressed and newly corporeal memories. The Solaris ocean may be a massive brain that creates these incarnate memories, though its purpose in doing so is unknown, forcing the scientists to shift the focus of their quest and wonder if they can truly understand the universe without first understanding what lies within their hearts.\n\nA fairly well-wrapped first book in a trilogy, that has some very imaginative and well worked through takes on what Martian life may have looked like at the time. I love the imagery, and the theology isn't as worked through everything as the other books. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nIn the first novel of C. S. Lewis‚Äôs classic science fiction trilogy, Dr. Ransom, a Cambridge academic, is abducted and taken on a spaceship to the red planet of Malacandra, which he knows as Mars. His captors are plotting to plunder the planet‚Äôs treasures and plan to offer Ransom as a sacrifice to the creatures who live there. Ransom discovers he has come from the ‚Äúsilent planet‚Äù‚ÄìEarth‚Äìwhose tragic story is known throughout the universe‚Ä¶\n\nThis book has a wonderful look at non-technological space travel and what paradise might look like on another planet. Lots of good philosophy, too. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nThe second novel in Lewis‚Äôs science fiction trilogy tells of Dr. Ransom‚Äôs voyage to the planet of Perelandra (Venus). Dr. Ransom is sent by the Elida to Perelandra (Venus) to battle against evil incarnate and preserve a second Eden from the evil forces present in the possessed body of his enemy, Weston. Through these works, Lewis explores issues of good and evil, and his remarkable and vividly imaginative descriptions of other worlds cements his place as a first-class author of science fiction adventure.\n\nOne of the weirdest books I have read and enjoyed. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nThe third novel in the science-fiction trilogy by C. S. Lewis. This final story is set on Earth, and tells of a terrifying conspiracy against humanity. The story surrounds Mark and Jane Studdock, a newly married couple. Mark is a sociologist who is enticed to join an organization called N.I.C.E. which aims to control all human life. His wife, meanwhile, has bizarre prophetic dreams about a decapitated scientist, Alcasan. As Mark is drawn inextricably into the sinister organization, he discovers the truth of his wife‚Äôs dreams when he meets the literal head of Alcasan which is being kept alive by infusions of blood. Jane seeks help concerning her dreams at a community called St. Anne‚Äôs, where she meets their leader‚ÄîDr. Ransom (the main character of the previous two titles in the trilogy). The story ends in a final spectacular scene at the N.I.C.E. headquarters where Merlin appears to confront the powers of Hell.\n\nI had been putting off reading this book for years, after reading Ender's Game and not knowing wanting to belittle it with a bad sequel (like I thought Ender's Shadow had been). I regret that immensely, having now read this book; it is deep, insightful, and brilliantly written. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nIn the aftermath of his terrible war, Ender Wiggin disappeared, and a powerful voice arose: the Speaker for the Dead, who told of the true story of the Bugger War.\n\nNow long years later, a second alien race has been discovered, but again the aliens‚Äô ways are strange and frightening‚Ä¶again, humans die. And it is only the Speaker for the Dead, who is also Ender Wiggin the Xenocide, who has the courage to confront the mystery‚Ä¶and the truth.\n\nDescription\n\nOne night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives.\n\nLife on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.\n\nThis book was written about 2010, and what the world would be like when the world is over populated. It is still very pertinent today, especially given the style of writing, which seems to have too much information packed in than needed. 'Muckers', the idea of people who go crazy without reason due to overcrowdedness, are a really interesting concept given the rise in anti-terrorist rhetoric in recent years. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nNorman Niblock House is a rising executive at General Technics, one of a few all-powerful corporations. His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically‚Äîit‚Äôs about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he‚Äôs about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world‚Ä¶ and kill him. These two men‚Äôs lives weave through one of science fiction‚Äôs most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos‚Äô U.S.A. trilogy, Stand on Zanzibar is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of 2010, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.\n\nIf you're going to read one Science Fiction book to get a broader perspective on what it means to be human and the size of space and time, read this one. It blew me away. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nStar Maker is a science fiction novel by Olaf Stapledon, published in 1937. The book describes a history of life in the universe, dwarfing in scale Stapledon‚Äôs previous book, Last and First Men (1930), a history of the human species over two billion years. Star Maker tackles philosophical themes such as the essence of life, of birth, decay and death, and the relationship between creation and creator. A pervading theme is that of progressive unity within and between different civilizations. Some of the elements and themes briefly discussed prefigure later fiction concerning genetic engineering and alien life forms. Arthur C. Clarke considered Star Maker to be one of the finest works of science fiction ever written.\n\nThis is one of Arthur C. Clarke's novels that is less about space and more about humanity, and the oceans. Clarke lived for a large part of his later life in Sri Lanka, and always loved the sea; in this book, that sentiment really comes out. I love it for that. It also has a nice view of ocean management, which is rare for books set in the future. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nA century into the future, humanity lives mostly on the sea. Gigantic whale herds are tended by submariners, and vast plankton farms feed the world.\n\nWalter Franklin, once a space engineer, now works on a submarine patrol. This novel tells the story of his adventures, including Franklin‚Äôs capture of an enormous kraken at 12,000 feet under the sea; his search for a monstrous sea serpent; and the thrilling rescue of a sunken submarine-all set against the backdrop of a futuristic world that‚Äôs both imaginative and believable.\n\nThis is an incredible book. Absolutely incredible. The first section, about a son of a scientist, is a great example of Wolfe's ability to make the future sound like the Victorian past, and to add decay to what, to our eyes, seems incredibly futuristic. The story about the traveler and the aborigines on Saint Croix is something I think about a lot - \"old men think long thoughts\", in particular, is a thought that I love, especially given its context. Gene Wolfe also uses the epistolary novel technique incredibly well in the third story. But the best part is how you come to realize that each of these stories is intertwined with the others, subtly. Amazing storytelling. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nGene Wolfe‚Äôs The Fifth Head of Cerberus is a universally acknowledged masterpiece of science fiction by one of the field‚Äôs most brilliant writers. Far out from Earth, two sister planets, Saint Anne and Saint Croix, circle each other in an eternal dance. It is said a race of shapeshifters once lived here, only to perish when men came. But one man believes they can still be found, somewhere in the back of the beyond.\n\nIn The Fifth Head of Cerberus, Wolfe skillfully interweaves three bizarre tales to create a mesmerizing pattern: the harrowing account of the son of a mad genius who discovers his hideous heritage; a young man‚Äôs mythic dreamquest for his darker half; the bizarre chronicle of a scientists‚Äô nightmarish imprisonment. Like an intricate, braided knot, the pattern at last unfolds to reveal astonishing truths about this strange and savage alien landscape.\n\nAn awesome book. Intriguing ,funny and moving. Never mind the negative reviews...I would have given it a 6th star if I could. - @naz2001\n\nDescription\n\nSome stories cannot be told in just one lifetime. Harry August is on his deathbed. Again. No matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes. Until now. As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. \"I nearly missed you, Doctor August,\" she says. \"I need to send a message.\" This is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.\n\nDescription\n\nIn the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens. But even free energy has a price. The transference process itself will eventually lead to the destruction of Earth‚Äôs Sun‚Äîand of Earth itself.\n\nOnly a few know the terrifying truth‚Äîan outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun. They know the truth‚Äîbut who will listen? They have foreseen the cost of abundant energy‚Äîbut who will believe? These few beings, human and alien, hold the key to Earth‚Äôs survival.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Golden Age is 10,000 years in the future in our solar system, an interplanetary utopian society filled with immortal humans.\n\nPhaethon, of Radamanthus House, is attending a glorious party at his family mansion celebrating the thousand-year anniversary of the High Transcendence. There he meets an old man who accuses him of being an imposter, and then a being from Neptune who claims to be an old friend. The Neptunian tells him that essential parts of his memory were removed and stored by the very government that Phaethon believes to be wholly honorable. It shakes his faith. Is he indeed an exile from himself? He can‚Äôt resist investigating, even though to do so could mean the loss of his inheritance, his very place in society. His quest must be to regain his true identity and fulfill the destiny he chose for himself.\n\nThe Golden Age is just the beginning of Phaethon‚Äôs story, which continues in The Phoenix Exultant.\n\nA really good book. Many people have described it as \"the best book of Sci-Fi / romance\". I would like to see it, one day, as a movie. - @Gibet\n\nDescription\n\nWhen a French expedition in Antarctica reveals ruins of a 900,000 year old civilization, scientists from all over the world flock to the site to help explore & understand. The entire planet watches via global satellite tv, mesmerized, as they uncover a chamber in which a man & a woman have been in suspended animation since, as the French title suggests, 'the night of time'. The woman, El√©a, is awakened. Thru a translating machine she tells the story of her world, herself & her husband Paikan & how war destroyed her civilization. She also hints at an incredibly advanced knowledge her still-dormant companion possesses, knowledge that could give energy & food to all humans at no cost. But the superpowers of the world are not ready to let El√©a's secrets spread, & show that, 900,000 years & an apocalypse later, humankind has not grown up & is ready to make the same mistakes again.\n\nThis is more of a read about what happens when you are outside the law than anything else. Fascinating, and kind of reads like Sherlock Holmes at times. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nThis masterpiece of science fiction is the fascinating story of Griffin, a scientist who creates a serum to render himself invisible, and his descent into madness that follows.\n\nUrsula Le Guin is an amazing writer, and this is one of her seminal works. It explores sexuality and humanity in ways that I didn't know were possible. I loved it. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nA groundbreaking work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can choose -and change - their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters.\n\nEmbracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.\n\nFunny, touching, and full of unexpected details. - @lgierth\n\nDescription\n\nFollow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space‚Äîand one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far reaches of the universe‚Äîin this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising sci-fi star.\n\nLife aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy‚Äîexactly what Rosemary wants. It‚Äôs also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary‚Äôs got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs‚Äîan experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn‚Äôt necessarily the worst thing in the universe.\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries is a series of novellas, each one around 150 pages starring a human-like android who keeps getting sucked back into adventure after adventure, though it just wants to be left alone, away from humanity and small talk and watch tv series. If you enjoy Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, this series of novellas might be for you. They are light, fun to read but yet still engaging enough to get your synapses fired up. - @oschrenk\n\nBooks:\n\nAll Systems Red [4.2]\n\nArtificial Condition [4.3]\n\nRogue Protocol [4.4]\n\nExit Strategy [4.4]\n\nDescription\n\nIn a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn‚Äôt a primary concern.\n\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‚Äòdroid ‚Äî a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as ‚ÄúMurderbot.‚Äù Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.\n\nBut when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.\n\nNeal Asher has written almost 20 books (if you include short story compilations) set within the universe of the Polity, an interstellar human civilization ruled by (mostly) benevolent AIs, all overseen by the most powerful AI of all: Earth Central. There are several distinct series within the larger Polity collection, as well as several standalone novels and short story collections. The Ian Cormac series follows a human agent of Earth Central as he investigates threats towards the Polity. The Spatterjay series explores the hostile world of Spatterjay and the lives of its hoopers: humans infected by an alien virus that grants its hosts functional immortality, immense strength, and incredible durability, but not without a cost. The Transformations series focuses on a rogue AI named Penny Royal capable of granting almost any wish, but its help is always a double-edged sword. His most recent series, Rise of the Jain, is about the re-emergence of an ancient and incredibly powerful alien race that disappeared after seeding the galaxy with technological seeds designed to destroy any intelligent civilization that came across one.\n\nAll of Asher's Polity novels are chock full of amazing technology, vibrant characters, picture-painting prose, and themes that explore the nature and limits of humanity. I was tempted to put this series under the Hard Sci-Fi category, as Asher introduces very few technologies that can't be extrapolated from existing tech, but a few things (e.g. FTL travel) and the distance in the future in which the series is set convinced me it should probably not be included in the \"hard\" category. - @isochronous\n\nDescription\n\nThe phrase ‚Äòworld-building‚Äô brings immediately to mind fantasy especially places like the Middle Earth of Tolkien but we don‚Äôt hear ‚Äòuniverse-building‚Äô nearly enough. SF authors not only have to create the history and society for one place, which isn‚Äôt usually even a planet in fantasy, but for an almost unimaginable universe, which needs to be filled with a multitude of races and planets with their own technology and vast history.\n\nIn the universe of the Polity Neal Asher has created ancient, but no longer completely active, races who remain a threat to the existence of humanity. He tells in passing of how a ‚ÄòQuiet War‚Äô replaced humans with the artificial intelligence and in doing so allowed humans more freedom than if they‚Äôd remained under their own governance. We get to see a world pre-Polity in The Line of the Polity and post-Polity twenty years later in The Technician, though the comparison is an aside to the storytelling.\n\nThis space opera novel reminds me of a series of Star Trek episodes, if Roddenberry's final frontier had been a Machiavellian rather than a utopian vision of the future. Unlike the crew of Trek's Enterprise, the Beagle crew engage in power struggles between its civilian and military leaders. The plot of the third section is very reminiscent of the Alien movie. - @neontapir\n\nDescription\n\nThe book can be roughly divided into four sections corresponding to the four short stories on which it was based. In the first part, the Space Beagle is infiltrated by Coeurl, a starving, intelligent and vicious cat-like carnivore with tentacles on its shoulders. In the second, the ship is almost destroyed by internal warfare caused by telepathic contact with a race of bird-like aliens. The third features Ixtl, a scarlet alien that kidnaps several crew members in order to implant parasitic eggs in their stomachs. In the last section, the crew battles Anabis, a galaxy-spanning consciousness.\n\nThis is always fun; it's a classic, and it is fun remembering what science fiction was like before there were tropes. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nMan had not yet learned to fly when H. G. Wells conceived this story of a Martian attack on England. Giant cylinders crash to Earth, disgorging huge, unearthly creatures armed with heat-rays and fighting machines. Amid the boundless destruction they cause, it looks as if the end of the world has come.\n\nVery interesting exploration of what happens when aliens arrive on earth, after the planet has been ravaged by war, with their own ideas of a path forward. Humans must learn to coexist with the Oankali, genetic colonizers of the cosmos, and confront what this means for their future ‚Äî deciding whether to give up an essential part of their identity in order to survive. I enjoyed the first book the most, for the worldbuilding and the way it introduces the Oankali and key concepts, but the series has a satisfying arc so I think it's worth reading all three books. - @bschlagel\n\nDescription\n\nLilith Iyapo has just lost her husband and son when atomic fire consumes Earth‚Äîthe last stage of the planet‚Äôs final war. Hundreds of years later Lilith awakes, deep in the hold of a massive alien spacecraft piloted by the Oankali‚Äîwho arrived just in time to save humanity from extinction. They have kept Lilith and other survivors asleep for centuries, as they learned whatever they could about Earth. Now it is time for Lilith to lead them back to her home world, but life among the Oankali on the newly resettled planet will be nothing like it was before.\n\nThe Oankali survive by genetically merging with primitive civilizations‚Äîwhether their new hosts like it or not. For the first time since the nuclear holocaust, Earth will be inhabited. Grass will grow, animals will run, and people will learn to survive the planet‚Äôs untamed wilderness. But their children will not be human. Not exactly.\n\nDescription\n\nIn this sequel to Dawn, Lilith Iyapo has given birth to what looks like a normal human boy named Akin. But Akin actually has five parents: a male and female human, a male and female Oankali, and a sexless Ooloi. The Oankali and Ooloi are part of an alien race that rescued humanity from a devastating nuclear war, but the price they exact is a high one the aliens are compelled to genetically merge their species with other races, drastically altering both in the process.\n\nOn a rehabilitated Earth, this \"new\" race is emerging through human/Oankali/Ooloi mating, but there are also \"pure\" humans who choose to resist the aliens and the salvation they offer. These resisters are sterilized by the Ooloi so that they cannot reproduce the genetic defect that drives humanity to destroy itself, but otherwise they are left alone (unless they become violent).\n\nWhen the resisters kidnap young Akin, the Oankali choose to leave the child with his captors, for he the most \"human\" of the Oankali children will decide whether the resisters should be given back their fertility and freedom, even though they will only destroy themselves again.\n\nDescription\n\nChild of two species, but part of neither, a new being must find his way.\n\nHuman and Oankali have been mating since the aliens first came to Earth to rescue the few survivors of an annihilating nuclear war. The Oankali began a massive breeding project, guided by the ooloi, a sexless subspecies capable of manipulating DNA, in the hope of eventually creating a perfect starfaring race.\n\nJodahs is supposed to be just another hybrid of human and Oankali, but as he begins his transformation to adulthood he finds himself becoming ooloi‚Äîthe first ever born to a human mother. As his body changes, Jodahs develops the ability to shapeshift, manipulate matter, and cure or create disease at will. If this frightened young man is able to master his new identity, Jodahs could prove the savior of what‚Äôs left of mankind. Or, if he is not careful, he could become a plague that will destroy this new race once and for all.\n\nNovels which place an emphasis on scientific accuracy and/or technical detail; where the science itself is a central topic.\n\nThough written after A Fire upon the Deep, A Deepness in the Sky is a prequel to Vinge's earlier novel, and shares one of its protagonists: the Qeng Ho trader Pham Nuwen. Though I read A Fire upon the Deep once and enjoyed it, I've read A Deepness in the Sky at least half a dozen times, and consider it my favorite hard sci-fi novel, period. Vernor Vinge was one of the first people to propose the idea of the technological singularity, and the near-future novels he wrote a decade or more ago have revealed themselves to be almost eerily prescient. - @isochronous\n\nDescription\n\nAfter thousands of years searching, humans stand on the verge of first contact with an alien race. Two human groups: the Qeng Ho, a culture of free traders, and the Emergents, a ruthless society based on the technological enslavement of minds.\n\nThe group that opens trade with the aliens will reap unimaginable riches. But first, both groups must wait at the aliens' very doorstep for their strange star to relight and for their planet to reawaken, as it does every two hundred and fifty years....\n\nDescription\n\nA Fire upon the Deep is the big, breakout book that fulfills the promise of Vinge‚Äôs career to date: a gripping tale of galactic war told on a cosmic scale.\n\nThousands of years hence, many races inhabit a universe where a mind‚Äôs potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these ‚Äúregions of thought,‚Äù but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.\n\nFleeing the threat, a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children‚Äîand a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.\n\nThis was, I thought, an emotional read. I really connected with the characters and their struggle. It was interesting seeing the ways they overcame each obstacle despite overwhelming odds. It also shows what could happen when desperate people are left to fend for themselves without a governing force. - @davidmerrique\n\nDescription\n\nA major new novel from one of science fiction's most powerful voices, AURORA tells the incredible story of our first voyage beyond the solar system.\n\nBrilliantly imagined and beautifully told, it is the work of a writer at the height of his powers.\n\nOur voyage from Earth began generations ago.\n\nNow, we approach our new home.\n\nAURORA.\n\nA cast of strange and wonderful characters. Overarching themes on consciousness, transhumanism, humanity and first contact. This book has everything. - @davidmerrique\n\nDescription\n\nIt‚Äôs been two months since a myriad of alien objects clenched about the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since‚Äîuntil a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out there: but not to us. Who to send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn‚Äôt want to meet? Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder, and a biologist so spliced to machinery he can‚Äôt feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior, and a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they‚Äôve been sent to find‚Äîbut you‚Äôd give anything for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them.\n\nA truly epic \"evolutionary science fiction\" story about animal uplift that feels very well researched. Tchaikovsky manages to perfectly immerse the reader in a radically different mindset. Even arachnofobics will root for the protagonists of the story. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nThe last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age ‚Äî a world terraformed and prepared for human life. But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare. Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?\n\nDescription\n\nBy the end of the 30th century humanity has the capability to travel the universe, to journey beyond earth and beyond the confines of the vulnerable human frame.\n\nThe descendants of centuries of scientific, cultural and physical development divide into three: fleshers‚Äîtrue Homo sapiens; Gleisner robots‚Äîembodying human minds within machines that interact with the physical world; and polises‚Äîsupercomputers teeming with intelligent software, containing the direct copies of billions of human personalities now existing only in the virtual reality of the polis.\n\nDiaspora is the story of Yatima‚Äîa polis being created from random mutations of the Konishi polis base mind seed‚Äîand of humankind, Of an astrophysical accident that spurs the thousandfold cloning of the polises. Of the discovery of an alien race and of a kink in time that means humanity‚Äîwhatever form it takes‚Äîwill never again be threatened by acts of God.\n\nDescription\n\nIn a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent life forms‚Äîthe cheela‚Äîliving on Dragon‚Äôs Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time men are their diligent teachers.\n\nDescription\n\nPrepare for a different kind of singularity in this follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel Blindsight\n\nIt's the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it‚Äôs all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.\n\nDaniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he‚Äôs turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.\n\nNow he‚Äôs trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn‚Äôt yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call ‚ÄúThe Angels of the Asteroids.‚Äù\n\nTheir pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.\n\nStephen Baxter explores the Fermi Paradox in different ways over the course of three books (and a collection of novellas), in a gloriously hard scifi style. It is very thought provoking, and also utterly brutal and bleak. Space and time is cold and uncaring. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nEach one of the main novels deals with a possible resolution to the Fermi paradox. The first, Time, is set in a universe that is completely devoid of intelligent life beyond that of mankind and its creations (i.e. A.I. and uplifted animals).\n\nThe second in the series, Space, proposes the opposite: that life is endemic to the universe, and there is intelligence in nearly all possible places of the cosmos. The solution to the Fermi Paradox in this novel is that intelligent life is continually wiped out by cosmic disasters before it has time to spread too far.\n\nThe third novel, Origin, is set in a multiverse that is a compromise between the ideals in the first two novels: that life is only on Earth, but at the same time is everywhere. This novel solves the Fermi Paradox by suggesting that intelligent life is segregated into separate parallel universes.\n\nNear-future hard Sci-Fi at its best. Lots of awards and endorsements, even a thumbs up from John Carmack. Can't go wrong. - @christianboyle\n\nDescription\n\nIn the near future, the experimental nano-drug Nexus can link humans together, mind to mind. There are some who want to improve it. There are some who want to eradicate it. And there are others who just want to exploit it.\n\nWhen a young scientist is caught improving Nexus, he‚Äôs thrust over his head into a world of danger and international espionage‚Äîfor there is far more at stake than anyone realizes.\n\nFrom the halls of academe to the halls of power; from the headquarters of an elite agency in Washington, D.C. to a secret lab beneath Shanghai; from the underground parties of San Francisco to the illegal biotech markets of Bangkok; from an international neuroscience conference to a remote monastery in the mountains of Thailand‚ÄîNexus is a thrill ride through a future on the brink of explosion.\n\nWith all the ideas contained in Permutation City, a typical Sci-Fi author would have written at least 5 separate books. - @uraimo\n\nDescription\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, technology has given birth to a form of immortality.

Admittedly some parts can be a slog, think A Song of Ice and Fire: awesome narrative in the grand scheme, with perhaps a bit too much description of Martian landscape/house sigils. - @rubzo\n\nDescription\n\nFor eons, sandstorms have swept the barren desolate landscape of the red planet. For centuries, Mars has beckoned to mankind to come and conquer its hostile climate. Now, in the year 2026, a group of one hundred colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers, and Arkady Bogdanov lead a mission whose ultimate goal is the terraforming of Mars. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness; for others it offers and opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. And for the genetic ‚Äúalchemists,‚Äù Mars presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life‚Ä¶ and death.\n\nDescription\n\nTwenty thousand years into the future, an experiment in quantum physics has had a catastrophic result, creating an enormous, rapidly expanding vacuum that devours everything it comes in contact with. Now humans must confront this deadly expansion. Tchicaya, aboard a starship trawling the border of the vacuum, has allied himself with the Yielders‚Äîthose determined to study the vacuum while allowing it to grow unchecked. But when his fiery first love, Mariama, reenters his life on the side of the Preservationists‚Äîthose working to halt and destroy the vacuum‚ÄîTchicaya finds himself struggling with an inner turmoil he has known since childhood.\n\nHowever, in the center of the vacuum, something is developing that neither Tchicaya and the Yielders nor Mariama and the Preservationists could ever have imagined possible: life.\n\nThis is a fun read; Weir manages to write an evocative techno-thriller without having his characters stoop to constant navel gazing and lonesome pining. This could be described as Robinson Crusoe - in Space. The characters on the earth side aren't the greatest, but the humor throughout the book really pulls it together, and watching a master at work as far as mechanical engineering goes was fascinating. Loved it. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nApollo 13 meets Cast Away in this grippingly detailed, brilliantly ingenious man-vs-nature survival thriller, set on the surface of Mars. Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first men to walk on the surface of Mars. Now, he‚Äôs sure he‚Äôll be the first man to die there.\n\nIt started with the dust storm that holed his suit and nearly killed him, and that forced his crew to leave him behind, sure he was already dead. Now he‚Äôs stranded millions of miles from the nearest human being, with no way to even signal Earth that he‚Äôs alive‚Äîand even if he could get word out, his food would be gone years before a rescue mission could arrive. Chances are, though, he won‚Äôt have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù are much more likely to get him first.\n\nBut Mark isn‚Äôt ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills‚Äîand a relentless, dogged refusal to quit‚Äîhe steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. But will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\n\nThis book is most interesting for its pretty cool take on terraforming a planet, and how that goes both for the inhabitants and what it means for nationalism (or planetism, as it were). - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nSpace writers holiday. When a celebrated science fiction writer takes to space on his first trip to Mars, he‚Äôs sure to be in for some heckling from the spaceship crew. But Martin Gibson, man about space, takes it all in his stride. That is, until he lands on the red planet. Once there the intrepid author causes one problem after another as he stumbles upon Mars‚Äô most carefully hidden secrets and threatens the future of an entire planet.\n\nFuture-based novels with advanced science and technology coupled with a disrupted social order.\n\nA fun and fast-paced hard-boiled cyberpunk noir, almost impossible to put down. - @helderroem\n\nDescription\n\nIt‚Äôs the twenty-fifth century, and advances in technology have redefined life itself. A person‚Äôs consciousness can now be stored in the brain and downloaded into a new body (or ‚Äúsleeve‚Äù,) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Onetime U.N. Envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Resleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco,) Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats existence as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning.\n\nDescription\n\nGreg Mandel, late of the Mindstar Battalion, has been many things in his life. Commando. Freedom fighter. Assassin. Now he‚Äôs a freelance operative with a very special edge: telepathy.\n\nIn the high-tech, hard-edged world of computer crime, zero-gravity smuggling, and artificial intelligence, Greg Mandel is the man to call when things get rough. But when an elusive saboteur plagues a powerful organization known as Event Horizon, Mandel must cut his way through a maze of corporate intrigue and startling new scientific discoveries.\n\nAnd nothing less than the future is at stake.\n\nMy favorite of Murakami's. Great mix of quirky, mundane, and fascinating ideas. Short read too. - @desandro\n\nDescription\n\nA narrative particle accelerator that zooms between Wild Turkey Whiskey and Bob Dylan, unicorn skulls and voracious librarians, John Coltrane and Lord Jim. Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into one rip-roaring novel, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami‚Äôs international following. Tracking one man‚Äôs descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Matrix is a world within the world, a global consensus hallucination, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace‚Ä¶\n\nCase had been the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employers crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.\n\nHotwired to the leading edges of art and technology, Neuromancer ranks with 1984 and Brave New World as one of the century‚Äôs most potent visions of the future.\n\nWith REAMDE (sic) Neal Stephenson returns with a much more down to earth cyberpunk story, closer to our own future and shaped not by the cyberpunk futures imagined in the early nineties but rather what we actually got instead in the 2000s. A few wrong turns quickly turns into a world-spanning chase, featuring terrorists, russian mobsters, online gaming and a more realistic, contemporary take on cyberpunk storytelling. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nFour decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers‚Äîyoung professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.\n\nFor Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up‚Äîa venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T‚ÄôRain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance‚Äîand Richard is caught at the center.\n\nIn this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.\n\nDescription\n\nIn reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo‚Äôs CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he‚Äôs a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that‚Äôs striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll recognize it immediately.\n\nI think of this book often, even though initially I had consigned it as a cheap paperback crime thriller set in space. The main part of this book that is interesting is the implications regarding policed thoughts, especially given recent advances in government surveillance. The other part of this book I think about a lot is the advertising jingle - Tenser, Tenser, said the tensor - which plays a major role. I've still got no idea what it is meant to mean. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nIn a world in which the police have telepathic powers, how do you get away with murder? Ben Reichs heads a huge 24th century business empire, spanning the solar system. He is also an obsessed, driven man determined to murder a rival. To avoid capture, in a society where murderers can be detected even before they commit their crime, is the greatest challenge of his life.\n\nThis book had me looking up more words than any book had me do for a long time. A mildly interesting story, with cunning turns and twists, in a very interesting world. What surprised me most was that the book already foresaw cryptocurrencies, 3d-printers and fleets of UAV's while already being 20+ years old. - @fritzvd\n\nDescription\n\nThe Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady‚Äôs Illustrated Primer is a postcyberpunk novel by Neal Stephenson. It is to some extent a science fiction coming-of-age story, focused on a young girl named Nell, and set in a future world in which nanotechnology affects all aspects of life. The novel deals with themes of education, social class, ethnicity, and the nature of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis book is fantastic not for the novelty of non-technological teleportation, but because of the main character. What happens when someone who has been ignored by society finds himself in a position of power? This book reminds me a tiny bit of Ender's Game - imagine what would happen if Mazer Rackham, another tattooed Maori hero, wanted more than to be a military genius. I loved it. I quote the poem to myself all the time, and have set a variant of it as my twitter bio for years now. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nIn this pulse-quickening novel, Alfred Bester imagines a future in which people ‚Äújaunte‚Äù a thousand miles with a single thought, where the rich barricade themselves in labyrinths and protect themselves with radioactive hit men‚Äîand where an inarticulate outcast is the most valuable and dangerous man alive. The Stars My Destination is a classic of technological prophecy and timeless narrative enchantment by an acknowledged master of science fiction.\n\nModernized cyberpunk with the noir grit dialled up to eleven. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nAn ex-corporate enforcer, Hakan Veil, is forced to bodyguard Madison Madekwe, part of a colonial audit team investigating a disappeared lottery winner on Mars. But when Madekwe is abducted, and Hakan nearly killed, the investigation takes him farther and deeper than he had ever expected. And soon Hakan discovers the heavy price he may have to pay to learn the truth.\n\nIdea-driven scifi about a tech-savvy movement of \"walkaways\", disenchanted people walking away from an increasingly oppressive capitalist society and creating their own ad-hoc societies. Doctorow manages to combine cyberpunk \"high tech, low life\" with a bit of utopian science fiction which feels very refreshing. - nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nIn a world of non-work, ruined by human-created climate change and pollution, and where people are under surveillance and ruled over by a mega-rich elite, Hubert, Etc, his friend Seth, and Natalie, decide that they have nothing to lose by turning their backs and walking away from the everyday world or \"default reality\".\n\nWith the advent of 3D printing ‚Äì and especially the ability to use these to fabricate even better fabricators ‚Äì and with machines that can search for and reprocess waste or discarded materials, they no longer have need of Default for the basic essentials of life, such as food, clothing and shelter.\n\nAs more and more people choose to \"walkaway\", the ruling elite do not take these social changes sitting down. They use the military, police and mercenaries to attack and disrupt the walkaways' new settlements.\n\nOne thing that the elite are especially interested in is scientific research that the walkaways are carrying out which could finally put an end to death ‚Äì and all this leads to revolution and eventual war.\n\nDescription\n\nCobb Anderson created the ‚Äúboppers,‚Äù sentient robots that overthrew their human overlords. But now Cobb is just an aging alcoholic waiting to die, and the big boppers are threatening to absorb all of the little boppers‚Äîand eventually every human‚Äîinto a giant, melded consciousness. Some of the little boppers aren‚Äôt too keen on the idea, and a full-scale robot revolt is underway on the moon (where the boppers live). Meanwhile, bopper Ralph Numbers wants to give Cobb immortality by letting a big bopper slice up his brain and tape his ‚Äúsoftware.‚Äù It seems like a good idea to Cobb.\n\nUtopian novels deal with imaginary communities or societies that are desirable or pleasant.\n\nA lovely balm for the weary science fiction reader about a post-collapse utopian society and the friendship between a human and a robot. -@nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nCenturies before, robots of Panga gained self-awareness, laid down their tools, wandered, en masse into the wilderness, never to be seen again. They faded into myth and urban legend. Now the life of the tea monk who tells this story is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of \"what do people need?\" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They will need to ask it a lot. Chambers' series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?\n\nMy first Arthur C. Clarke Sci-fi book that introduced me to the world of Arthur C. Clarke. The book deals with the utopian society where the aliens are human beings from the old earth. -@DibeshMSShrestha\n\nDescription\n\nJust a few islands in a planetwide ocean, Thalassa was a veritable paradise‚Äîhome to one of the small colonies founded centuries before by robot Mother Ships when the Sun had gone nova and mankind had fled Earth.\n\nMesmerized by the beauty of Thalassa and overwhelmed by its vast resources, the colonists lived an idyllic existence, unaware of the monumental evolutionary event slowly taking place beneath their seas...\n\nThen the Magellan arrived in orbit carrying one million refugees from the last, mad days on Earth. And suddenly uncertainty and change had come to the placid paradise that was Thalassa.\n\nDystopian novels deal with imaginary communities or societies that are undesirable or frightening.\n\nDescription\n\nWritten in 1948, 1984 was George Orwell‚Äôs chilling prophecy about the future.\n\nWhile 1984 has come and gone, Orwell‚Äôs narrative is more timely that ever. 1984 presents a ‚Äúnegative utopia,‚Äù that is at once a startling and haunting vision of the world‚Äîso powerful that it‚Äôs completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of entire generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions‚Äîa legacy that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.\n\n[3.99]\n\nBetter than the movie IMHO. Written in a slang language called Nadsat, the book really draws you into the world Alex occupies, as opposed to Kubrick's version of the story, portrayed in the movie. The endings are also different! - @alexkeyes\n\nDescription\n\nA vicious fifteen-year-old \"droog\" is the central character of this 1963 classic, whose stark terror was captured in Stanley Kubrick's magnificent film of the same title.\n\nIn Anthony Burgess's nightmare vision of the future, where criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex ‚Äî to \"redeem\" him ‚Äî the novel asks, \"At what cost?\"\n\nThis book is insidiously horrifying in its applicability, more so than 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. Here's a comic that sums up the difference. Well worth the read. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nFar in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his distress‚Ä¶\n\nHuxley‚Äôs ingenious fantasy of the future sheds a blazing light on the present and is considered to be his most enduring masterpiece.\n\nThe debut novel from the guy who would go on to write Half-Life and Portal. A dizzyingly funny dystopia straight from the heart of the 80s. Deftly manages the tightrope walk of absurdity without the world crumbling underneath it. Philip K. Dick would be proud. - @jackflips\n\nDescription\n\nThe US is divided into independent, heavily defended neighborhoods; Cobblestone Hill is a planned, self-sufficient community, dreamed up and secretly controlled by the mysterious Doc Edison; here Dad Johnson struggles to raise his oddball family and defend his house against potentially hostile neighbors.\n\nOne-upmanship is still alive, though, and when Jock Smith plants a rocket launcher in his backyard, Dad responds with a nuclear reactor in his garage. (Doc Edison thoughtfully gene-splices the new Johnson baby so that she eats nuclear waste.)\n\nDad's son P.J., discovering that he's been programmed to be gay (as part of Doc Edison's notions of a \"balanced family\"), flees the enclave, only to be captured, drugged, and brainwashed by Christian Soldiers. Dad's wife Connie runs off with a salesman from the ubiquitous Cartel; a bunch of Doc Edison clones show up, all quite mad; the Christian Soldiers attempt a computerized invasion; and the feud between Dad and Jock Smith comes to a head.\n\nOne of my favorite trilogies! Divergent is a young adult science fiction trilogy. This book is about a dystopian Chicago society divided by five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor. Factions that were created to maintain peace within the society. In this book you follow the story of Beatrice, who's decisions leads her to discover who she really is and what is really happening. Through the trilogy you are able to see how the character evolves and becomes more mature with her decisions... decisions that not only impact her life but others too. I highly recommend this book! The ending of the trilogy left me astonished for 3 days after I finished it! (good thing I got to discuss it with one of my friends!) - @GracielaGarcia\n\nDescription\n\nIn Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue‚ÄîCandor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is‚Äîshe can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.\n\nDuring the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are‚Äîand where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.\n\nA classic, beautiful book. A short read that does a good job of making the reader think about the ramifications of censorship, and is still entertaining and beautiful in its own way. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nThe terrifyingly prophetic novel of a post-literate future.\n\nGuy Montag is a fireman. His job is to burn books, which are forbidden, being the source of all discord and unhappiness. Even so, Montag is unhappy; there is discord in his marriage. Are books hidden in his house? The Mechanical Hound of the Fire Department, armed with a lethal hypodermic, escorted by helicopters, is ready to track down those dissidents who defy society to preserve and read books.\n\nThe classic dystopian novel of a post-literate future, Fahrenheit 451 stands alongside Orwell‚Äôs 1984 and Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World as a prophetic account of Western civilization‚Äôs enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.\n\nBradbury‚Äôs powerful and poetic prose combines with uncanny insight into the potential of technology to create a novel which, decades on from first publication, still has the power to dazzle and shock.\n\nThis book is a wonderfully constructed tale that can be seen as warning for an age where genetic engineering is up and coming and we haven't the faintest clue where this might lead us. I loved it to bits and only found out there was a sequel by reading about the final episode coming out when I was well done with the first part and devoured the other two as eagerly as the first. That said, I find the first the best of the three books. - @fritzvd\n\nDescription\n\nOryx and Crake is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling vision of the future. Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey‚Äìwith the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake‚Äìthrough the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining.\n\nThis is easily in one of my top 5 favorite books I've ever read. It's SO fun to read, and every single person I've recommended it to has loved it. Even if you don't understand every single reference, it's still a great story to follow. It has an excellent amount of humor, adventure, and nostalgia. It also has one of the best endings I've ever read, which any reader knows is a hard thing to nail. Ernest Cline really hit it out of the park with this one. Highly recommend it. - cassidoo\n\nThis book is AWESOME. It's so AWESOME that it makes me want to go back and play arcade games and rewatch all of the Macross saga. The plot is great, the writing is great, it makes you laugh out loud if you're a geek and know the references, and the story is kickass. Warning: Might be a good idea to brush up on your old school fantasy and scifi before reading this. Just don't go rewatch Krull, OK? - RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nIt‚Äôs the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.\n\nLike most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets.\n\nAnd like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune‚Äîand remarkable power‚Äîto whoever can unlock them.\n\nFor years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday‚Äôs riddles are based in the pop culture he loved‚Äîthat of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday‚Äôs icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes‚Äôs oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.\n\nAnd then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.\n\nSuddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt‚Äîamong them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life‚Äîand love‚Äîin the real world he‚Äôs always been so desperate to escape.\n\nA world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready?\n\nSci-Fi, sociology and philosophy. - @NaxYoMizmo\n\nDescription\n\nShevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life‚ÄîShevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Urras, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.\n\nA bleak and haunting tale, easy to picture playing out in today's political climate. There's a reason the TV series adaptation is popular. - @neontapir\n\nDescription\n\nSet in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States, now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men of its population.\n\nGreat dystopian work shows the impact of Universal basic income to society. - @4ndrej\n\nDescription\n\nSet in a future August 1999, novel of an overpopulated urban jungle, a divided class system‚Äîoperating within an atmosphere of riots, food shortages, and senseless acts of violence‚Äîand a desperate hunt for the truth by a cynical NYC detective tells a classic tale of a dark future. The 1973 science fiction movie Soylent Green is loosely based on this novel.\n\nMy favourite of all Philip K. Dick's novels, the I Ching and the alternate history within an alternate history novel being interesting elements. - @roryrjb\n\nDescription\n\nAn alternate history novel set in 1962, fifteen years after an alternate ending to World War II which in the novel lasted until 1947, the novel concerns intrigues between the victorious Axis Powers‚ÄîImperial Japan and Nazi Germany‚Äîas they rule over the former United States, as well as daily life under the resulting totalitarian rule.\n\nAn interesting take on the possibly negative consequences of the singularity. A little more vulgar than the average Sci-Fi novel. - @sylvarant\n\nDescription\n\nIn a time not far from our own, Lawrence sets out simply to build an artificial intelligence that can pass as human, and finds himself instead with one that can pass as a god. Taking the Three Laws of Robotics literally, Prime Intellect makes every human immortal and provides instantly for every stated human desire. Caroline finds no meaning in this life of purposeless ease, and forgets her emptiness only in moments of violent and profane exhibitionism. At turns shocking and humorous, Prime Intellect looks unflinchingly at extremes of human behavior that might emerge when all limits are removed.\n\nSet in the near future, the story follows a number of characters as their lives unfold living in an underground silo. Life underground seems quite grim, people have obviously been down there quite a while, and even though they seem to have quite advanced technology, it's old and decaying. The engineers and mechanics do their best to keep the electricity throughout the 100 levels of the silo, it's a lottery to see who gets to start a family as the population needs to be strictly controlled.\n\nIt's set close enough to the present that you can see how things could end up the way they are in the silo, the political structures, the way the silo is organized, the rivalry between the various levels and departments; but what happened to lead to humanity living this way in the first place? Why are they all down there, and what's wrong with the surface?\n\nThis series of books is well worth a read, I couldn't put it down once I got into the first few chapters. I think this series will be recognized as a sci-fi classic in the coming years.\n\nAlso, the first book is available free on Kindle, so it won't cost you anything to check it out - except maybe a Kindle. - @elektrovert\n\nDescription\n\nThis Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. It is for those who arrived late to the party and who wish to save a dollar or two while picking up the same stories in a single package.\n\nThis is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple.

The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport ‚Äútunnels‚Äù known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star‚Ä¶ vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.\n\nOpposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship‚Äôs mission for its own ends.\n\nPursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth‚Ä¶ and humanity itself. Could it be that Johansson was right?\n\nDescription\n\nDeploying invulnerable twenty-fifth-century soldiers called Skins, Zantiu-Braun‚Äôs corporate starships loot entire planets. But as the Skins invade bucolic Thallspring, Z-B‚Äôs strategy is about to go awry, all because of: Sgt.

Grimly determined to steal, or protect, a mysterious treasure, the three players engage in a private war that will explode into unimaginable quests for personal grace‚Ä¶ or galactic domination.\n\nDescription\n\nSix million years ago, at the dawn of the star-faring era, Abigail Gentian fractured herself into a thousand male and female clones, which she called shatterlings. But now, someone is eliminating the Gentian line. Campion and Purslane‚Äîtwo shatterlings who have fallen in love and shared forbidden experiences‚Äîmust determine exactly who, or what, their enemy is, before they are wiped out of existence.\n\nDescription\n\nOn the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope‚Äîand a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands.\n\nA stunning tour de force filled with transcendent awe and wonder, Hyperion is a masterwork of science fiction that resonates with excitement and invention, the first volume in a remarkable new science fiction epic by the multiple-award-winning author of The Hollow Man.\n\nDescription\n\nThe trilogy is set in a universe with a wealth of worlds and artificial orbiting colonies. The plot is centered on the souls of the dead coming back from a hellish ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù to possess the living, and the latter fighting back. It was followed by a companion to the series, The Confederation Handbook, an informational book containing data about the universe of the Night‚Äôs Dawn trilogy. Hamilton re-set several earlier short stories in the Confederation timeline, published as the collection A Second Chance at Eden, including the newly written title novella.\n\nAlastair Reynolds' take on the Fermi Paradox is a vast and brutal epic, consisting of the three \"main\" books (forming the \"Inhibitor Trilogy\") and a few other books and novellas set in the same universe. Revelation Space is page-turning \"hard space opera\" - believable but fantastic, and delightfully bizarre at times. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nNine hundred thousand years ago, something annihilated the Amarantin civilization just as it was on the verge of discovering space flight. Now one scientist, Dan Sylveste, will stop at nothing to solve the Amarantin riddle before ancient history repeats itself. With no other resources at his disposal, Sylveste forges a dangerous alliance with the cyborg crew of the starship Nostalgia for Infinity. But as he closes in on the secret, a killer closes in on him. Because the Amarantin were destroyed for a reason ‚Äî and if that reason is uncovered, the universe‚Äîand reality itself ‚Äî could be irrecoverably altered...\n\nPeter Hamilton is back with another story featuring a wormhole-based multi-planetary society, and this one has elements of both space opera and cyberpunk. The perspective shifts between 2204 and several thousand years into the future. Starts slow but when the shit hits the fan it hits with a vengeance. Three books in total, a very good read. - @nahkampf\n\nDescription\n\nIn 2204, humanity is expanding into the wider galaxy in leaps and bounds. A new technology of linked jump gates has rendered most forms of transporation--including starships--virtually obsolete. Every place on earth, every distant planet mankind has settled, is now merely a step away from any other. And all seems wonderful...until a crashed alien spaceship is found on a newly-located world 89 light years from Earth, harboring seventeen human victims. And of the high-powered team dispatched to investigate the mystery, one is an alien spy...\n\nDescription\n\nThe war raged across the galaxy. Billions had died, billions more were doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles were at stake. There could be no surrender.\n\nNovels concerning the end of civilization, usually based in a future resulting from a catastrophe of some sort, where only scattered elements of technology remain.\n\nThis has a particularly arid and inspired view of humanity after a nuclear holocaust. The discovery of small things and their new importance down the line is well done here. - @RichardLitt\n\nDescription\n\nWinner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, Walter M. Miller, Jr.‚Äôs A Canticle for Leibowitz is a true lan"
