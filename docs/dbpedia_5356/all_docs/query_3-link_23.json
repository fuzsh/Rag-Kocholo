You'll get a good sense of whether your book will be a good fit by looking at the books the agency has represented.\n\nNote: You can find a comprehensive list of agents seeking clients here: http://publishedtodeath.blogspot.com/p/agents.html\n\n______________________\n\nCarlie Webber (CK Webber Associates)\n\nAbout Carlie: For ten years, she worked as a public librarian serving teens and adults, served on book awards committees, and reviewed books professionally for journals including Kirkus Reviews and VOYA. Wishing to pursue her interest in the business side of books, she then enrolled in the Columbia Publishing Course. Her professional publishing experience includes an internship at Writers House and work with the Publish or Perish Agency/New England Publishing Associates and the Jane Rotrosen Agency.\n\nWhat she is looking for: “I prefer my adult speculative fiction to have some grounding in reality, so for that audience am looking for SF set in our world, or a world with strong echoes of our own. I’d love books like YEAR ZERO by Rob Reid or READY PLAYER ONE by Ernest Cline. I’m a little more flexible when it comes to YA in terms of being removed from reality, and I especially enjoy teen books set in alternate societies. Some YA books along the lines of what I’m looking for include LEGEND by Marie Lu and THE DARKEST MINDS by Alexandra Bracken.”\n\nHow to Submit: To submit your work for consideration, please send a query letter, synopsis, and the first 30 pages (or three chapters of your work, whichever is more) to carlie [@] ckwebber.com and put the word “Query” in the subject line of your email.

We will not open attachments unless they have been requested in advance.” Please do not query Amanda Rutter of Red Sofa Literary (also on this list) if querying Jennie.\n\n———————\n\nMoe Ferrara (BookEnds)\n\nAbout Moe: \"Becoming a literary agent was fitting for the girl who, as a small child, begged her dad to buy her a book simply because \"it has a hard cover.\" Growing up, she had a hard time finding YA books outside of Christopher Pike and R. L. Stine, and instead tackled Tom Clancy or her mom's romance novels. Though her career path zigzagged a bit—she attended college as a music major, earned a JD from Pace Law School, then worked various jobs throughout the publishing industry—Moe was thrilled to join the BookEnds team in May of 2015 as a literary agent and the foreign rights manager.\"\n\nWhat she is seeking: Moe is interested in science fiction and fantasy for all age groups (no picture books).\n\nHow to Submit: Send queries to MFsubmissions [@] bookendsliterary.com.

Perkins Agency, where she learned invaluable lessons and made a name for herself in the industry.

I’m an energy, space, and time travel nerd. So bring it on! I’m also really looking for MG and YA. MG Science fiction would be a dream. Especially if there is some kind of adventure and high stakes, even if the stakes are just important to the main character. They don’t have to be saving the world, but if they are it needs to be a well thought out and unique idea.”\n\nHow to Submit: Marisa prefers that you attach the 1-2 page synopsis (double-spaced) and the first 5 pages of your manuscript to the query e-mail as separate Word .doc or .docx files.

She is a member of Romance Writers of America.\n\nWhat she is looking for: Fantasy: \"I’m particularly drawn to characters whose struggles include not just “the quest”, but also choices that challenge their beliefs or values. I love both high- and low-magic fantasies; cohesive worldbuilding is the more important ingredient. While I tend to prefer epic, contemporary, or dark fantasies, I also enjoy trying new things.\n\nScience Fiction: I love SF of all stripes, and in particular I’m drawn toward space opera and military SF. To explore what it means to be human, how technology (or aliens) affects that definition, and how to remain human given that (or if we should at all) are particularly intriguing to me. Large-scale stories are fantastic, but I’m also very interested in smaller-scale stories, where there focus is on a particular group of characters and not necessarily the fate of the galaxy. (And I really love space battles.)\n\nFor both science fiction and fantasy, complex magical/technological, political, and social systems are all good things in my book, as are moral quandaries and ambiguity. I’m also very interested in seeing female protagonists and/or settings outside the typical European setting.\"\n\nHow to Submit: To query, send your query letter (and optional 1-2 page synopsis) to querylisa [@] awfulagent.com. No attachments. Emails containing unsolicited attachments will be deleted.\n\n___________________________"
