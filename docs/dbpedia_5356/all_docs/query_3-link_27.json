        "text": "About the Book\n\nIn historical fiction the plot is set in the past, and pays attention to the manners, social conditions and other details of the period portrayed. Some authors choose to include famous historical figures in their fictional plots, so that audiences can imagine how those individuals might have responded to the plots and environments established by the author. The Western literary component of this genre is founded in the early 19th century works of such authors as Sir Walter Scott, Honor√© de Balzac, James Fenimore Cooper, and Leo Tolstoy.\n\nAlso in this Book\n\nThe romance novel, which is sometimes termed the romantic novel, places its primary focus on the development of a romantic relationship and love between two people. The sub-genres of the romance novel include: fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction. Romance novels existed in ancient Greece, and were also to be found in the literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries in the works of such authors as Samuel Richardson and Jane Austen.\n\nAlso in this Book\n\nTitles covering drama and theater in the United States describe that part of the European theatrical tradition, dating back to ancient Greek theater, that is heavily influenced by British theatre. US drama has been heavily focussed on New York City at Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway. Outside of New York, larger cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. some works aspiring to eventually play in New York. US theater also has an active community theater culture, relying on local volunteers.\n\nAbout us\n\nLeopold Classic Library has the goal of making available to readers the classic books that have been out of print for decades.
