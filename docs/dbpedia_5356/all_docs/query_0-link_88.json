Appealing because it can offer dreams, the fulfillment of wishes, and escape; but puzzling because it spans such a wide and diverse range of books, from such key works of the twentieth century as Kafka’s The Trial to the rows and rows of sword-and-sorcery epics that currently jam bookracks all over the world.\n\nTo bring some standards to bear and to guide possibly confused readers through this mass, James Cawthorn and Michael Moor­ cock here offer their personal choice of the 100 best books that the genre has produced. And, as one would expect with two such expert authors, the choices are shrewd and informed, and the accounts of each book blend information and judgement in a highly entertaining manner. The books are presented in date order, so that the guide as a whole builds into an informal history of fantastic writing, from such early classics as Gulliver’s Travels, Vathck and Moby-Dick, through the pulp era of the 1930s which produced extraordin­ ary works like Abraham Merrit’s Dulellers in the Mirage and Robert E. Howard’s Conan series, to contemporary fantisists such as Fritz Leiber, Angela Carter and Peter Ackroyd. In their selections and their by turns warm and tart comments James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock give a unique insiders’ view of a literature that already provokes fierce controversy among fans and critics alike; without doubt, Fantasy: the 100 Best Booths will add explosive fuel to the debate, and remain a source of knowledge and de­ light for years to come.\n\nFANTASY --------- THE----------\n\nlOO\n\nBEST BOOKS\n\nJames Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock\n\nFANTASY --------- THE----------\n\n1OO\n\nBEST BOOKS\n\nDEDICATION To my mother - J.C.\n\nCopyright © James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock 1988\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nFirst published in Great Britain by Xanadu Publications Ltd 1988 First published in the United States of America by Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc. 1988 Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc. 260 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10001 Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data\n\nCawthorn, James Fantasy : the 100 best books / James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock. — 1st Carroll & Graf ed. p. cm.

In all of its forms, including the historically recent ‘realistic’ novel, it springs from the human urge to fantasize. For a while, as popular fiction burgeoned under the demands of a newly literate public, the term was restricted to a sub-category of stories which dealt with atavistic fears and allegedly discredited beliefs. A public which happily accepted private eyes who solved fiendishly complicated mysteries despite repeated blows to the head and stupefying doses of alcohol, cowboys who never had to count the cost of ammunition, and lovers whose most intimate problems concerned their cheque-books, baulked at the implausibilities of space-travel and the supernatural. The current contents of bookshop shelves suggest that these prejudices are fading. If all fiction is fantasy, how can it be possible to select the one hundred best? It isn’t. The reader will not find dale Dorrit, Blood on the Moon, or The High Window among these choices, nor expect to. Fantasy has been narrowed down to ‘Fantasy’. The only quibble, apart from the merits of the chosen books, is likely to be over whether some might more properly belong to another sub-category, sf. The answer, to misquote an American critic, is that ‘Fantasy’ is what I point to when I say it. Greater public acceptance has stimulated publishers and authors to step up production. To keep abreast of the torrent of dragons, unicorns, mages and moody swords sluicing through the bookstores is impossible; the spate of the late ’80s is represented here by a single title, Expecting Someone Taller. Most of the choices are considerably older, from less prolific years. An immensely helpful side-effect of the boom has been the resurrection of such rarities as Lindsay’s A Voyage to Arcturus, The Haunted Woman, and the novels of William Hope Hodgson. Reading the encylopedic The Gothic Quest by Montague Summers, however, almost makes me grateful that much of the literature of the past two centuries is no longer available. There are limits. In an earlier volume in the ‘100 Best’ series, H.R.F. Keating says that he excluded certain titles because they are now almost unobtainable. The contrary view is taken here, in the hope that it might help to revive interest in neglected works and encourage their reprinting. An example is Caravan for China by the late Frank Stuart. Published at the outbreak of World War Two, it was obliterated by subsequent events, like so many of the books of that time. My own copy, discovered after the war, is the only one I have ever seen, as was my copy (now lost) of his Elephant in Jet. It is a depressing fact that the quality of a book does not guarantee it against neglect. Maurice Richardson’s The Exploits of Engelbrecht, last seen in 1977 in a limited paperback edition, is surely due for revival in a more ambi­ tious format. The massive and unique fantasies of Wm. Hope Hodgson vir­ tually disappeared from his native Britain for decades, kept in print only by the superb Arkham House edition from America, until fairly recently. Jack Vance’s The Dying Earth became a much-sought item by those who had 8\n\nmissed its original appearance in 1950, but they had to wait twelve years for a second chance. The many references to films are the result of growing up in a time and place where radio and the cinema were the chief sources of mass family enter­ tainment. There was less concern then about the effects of films upon the infant psyche; consequently, I was three years old when I saw King Kong, which proved to be the first item in a steady diet of mummies, werewolves, vampires, zombies and other future cult figures. Later, having learned that they mostly originated in books, I became intrigued and puzzled by the dis­ crepancies between literary and cinematic horrors. Later still, I became familiar with the bizarre philosophies of film-makers, and some of the dis­ crepancies were explained. Looking back, the fiction and films of those days seem wholesome by com­ parison with current offerings, however resolutely they set out to titillate and scare us. Still influenced by nineteenth-century traditions and constrained by the morality of their times, authors and directors used indirection to heighten the impact of whatever crawled, leaped, lurched or flapped through the shadowed chambers of their fancies. It has been left to today’s exponents to stake all upon explicitness, inducing nausea rather than the shivery thrill, and replacing the haunted room with the abattoir. Overkill has become the norm; Spielberg’s Indiana Jones series, supposedly his homage to the Saturday mati­ nées of his childhood, are actually banana-fingered and costly exercises in gratuitous, sadistic violence. The widespread feedback between book and screen is part of a growing preference for clubbing the audience into accep­ tance, rather than prodding it into awareness. The selections in this book naturally reflect this background and these views, but offer, I think, an interesting cross-section of the genre. In the end, all such lists are highly personal—and, as it turned out, the choices are mainly of one person rather than two . . . —JAMES CAWTHORN\n\nI was originally commissioned to write this book by Xanadu, but when other commitments made it clear that I would not be able to deliver it for a long while, the publishers and I agreed that James Cawthorn was the person to take it over. We could think of no one better qualified or better read, and I think that his text—by far the greater portion, including the parts about a certain albino—bears out our judgement: his range, expertise and the witty, affectionate judgement he displays are, as always, impressive. I should not be so impressed. I have now worked with Jim for over thirty years, first on fanzines like BURROUGHSIANA, later on TARZAN ADVENTURES and then on NEW WORLDS, where his reviews were regularly published, together with his fine illustrations. We were also co-auth­ ors of a Sexton Blake story, Caribbean Crisis, wrote The Distant Suns together for THE ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY OF INDIA and co-scripted the film 9\n\nversion of Burrough’s The Land That Time Forgot. My only disappointment is that Mythago Wood and/or Eavondyss by Robert Holdstock did not find a place here, though I have written about Mythago Wood in a companion to the present volume, Horror: 100 Best Books. But overall, I am rather glad of the circumstances which lead to Jim, rather than myself, doing the main work on the book: I believe that he has done a far better job than I could have done alone, and am convinced that thanks to him this will remain a standard work when most other guides to fantastic fiction are forgotten. —MICHAEL MOORCOCK\n\nNOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The books chosen are presented in broadly chronological sequence: ‘broadly’ because it is sometimes difficult to know exactly where a particular piece belongs. The ‘Zothique’ stories of Clark Ashton Smith, for instance, were not collected together until 1970, but were mostly written in the 1930s. More important, they are very much of the 1930s, and so that is where they appear in this book. In quite a few other cases too, stories appeared in magazines some time before attaining book form, so the sharp-eyed reader will occasion­ ally notice a discrepancy between the date at the top of an essay and the one in the bibliographical details at the end, which list first book editions only (the true first edition comes first, followed by the first transatlantic edition if there is one). This information was kindly supplied by John Clute. Thanks are also due to Dave Britton, Charles Partington and the publisher for advice and copies of hard-to-find titles, to our families and the staff of Gateshead Central Library, and to others who offered encouragement. The piece on Expecting Someone Taller first appeared in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, 1988. All errors, particularly of fact and taste, are our own.\n\n10\n\n[1726]\n\n1 JONATHAN SWIFT\n\nGulliver’ s Travels When William (Rural Rides') Cobbett was eleven years old, he set out to walk from Windsor to Kew, a crow’s-flight of fifteen miles. He was seeking work as a gardener, demonstrating that mobility of labour is not an exclusively modern preserve. In a Richmond shop, a book-title caught his fancy. The book cost three pence, exactly as much as stood between himself and a supperless night. He bought it. Luckily, he got the job he sought. The title was A Tale of a Tub. The author, by then thirty years dead, was Jonathan Swift. Two centuries later, Swift is still persuading people to part with their money. A Dublin-born Protestant, he was ordained a minister in 1694. In an age which did not subscribe to our curious notion that religion should exist in a vacuum, he plunged deeply into English politics. Inevitably, this involved the unhappy relationship between England and Ireland, a problem already old. The death of Queen Anne and the crowning of George the First precipi­ tated a political witch-hunt which obliged him to retreat to Dublin. There, while serving as Dean of St Patrick’s Cathedral, he transformed his experi­ ences into the stuff of fiction, in the adventures of a ship’s surgeon from London, Lemuel Gulliver. Terra, diminishingly incognita, was already being processed by travelwriters for the benefit of a readership hungry for wonders. These forerunners of coffee-table books and endless television series were a mixture of accurate observation, pardonable ignorance and perhaps less pardonable misinterpre­ tation. In this latter aspect, they were more akin to those specious works tell­ ing us how interstellar visitors taught us to tie up our shoelaces. Swift, with malice aforethought, adapted the form to satirical uses. Published under a pseudonym, after undercover negotiations carried out during a return visit to England, the book sold out within a week. Plainly, a satire which is still bought and read after 250 years does owe its continuing popularity to the reader’s interest in the Whigs and Tories. For anyone desiring specific political references, there are numerous scholarly commentaries available. Those who are content to find universal applications for Swift’s lampooning of the ways of statesmen and princes will appreciate that depressingly little has changed, in that respect, since the eighteenth century. Dramatizations tend to be confined to the Lilliputian episodes, skip­ ping lightly over the more pungent details; suitably bowdlerized, the unfail­ ing doll’s-house appeal of the miniature kingdoms has made it a children’s classic. 11\n\nThe savagery of Swift’s view of humanity grows as Gulliver, for whom the perilous seas seem preferable to any extended contact with his wife and family, takes ever more improbable voyages. Imaginary islands in profusion dot the world’s oceans, a vast peninsula is grafted on to North America, while ships whizz from Africa to the Pacific at speeds which suggest supersonic winds. Throughout, the good doctor protests his honesty and unwillingness to exploit the reader’s credulity. He is the most impressionable of travellers, for ever taking on the characteristics of the peoples he encounters, only to be discomfited by his return to European ways. The generally humane attitudes of the sea-captains who rescue him, and their patience with one whom they not surprisingly consider to be deranged, never seem to dent his soured opinion of his kind. Only once, after recruiting a crew of obvious malcon­ tents, is he ill-treated, and even then his life is spared. A giant in Lilliput, Gulliver becomes a midget in monstrous Brobdingnag. His friend and guardian is a girl of nine, Glumdalclitch, who stands a mere forty feet tall. Older girls submit him to titillatory indignities and he is exploited as a physical freak. Carried off by an eagle and rescued by British seamen, he is soon outward bound again, fated to land anywhere but at his intended destination. His third voyage presents the literature with its first fully fashioned flying saucer, Laputa. Clashing head-on with the scientific New Men of the Royal Society, Swift populates his airborne island with purblind introverts bent on devising implausible means for achieving the impossible. Ironically, his Laputians anticipated the real world’s discovery of the twin satellites of Mars, then unsuspected by stargazers. A passage in which Laputa was clearly meant to represent the British Government was judged to be too subversive to print, but Swift, back in Ireland, knew nothing of the deletion until after publication. Encounters with magicians and immortals precede Gulliver’s final and most controversial adventure, in the country of the Houyhnhnms. These graceful and intelligent horse-like beings employ as labourers the squalid, man-like Yahoos. Gulliver, in common with many of Swift’s critics, shrinks from being equated with the latter; in particular, from being embraced by a female Yahoo on heat. Upon returning to England, he transfers this antipathy to his long-suffering family. Had Swift fallen among the Houyhnhnms, it seems probable that he would soon have found their nobility as unbearable as the hypocrisy and shallowness of his fellow men. Whatever Jesus took him for, it can’t have been a sunbeam.

Horace W alpole did not invent the basic constituents of the Gothic novel, but in The Castle of Otranto he combined them in a manner which became a standard formula for the next two centuries. It was the publisher’s equivalent of sliced bread. Their readers took to its clammy horrors with delight, and in growing numbers as the ‘penny dreadfuls’ set out to wring the last drop of ichor from its lurid lexicon. Bv then, the Gothic had travelled far from its original sources of inspir­ ation. The prevalence of castles in the literature was no accident, nor was the frequency with which thev were built on the iceberg principle, with ninetenths of their structure consisting of subterranean vaults. These spectreinfested spaces were rooted in the fantasies of an architect, Giovanni Piranesi. A revised edition of his Carceri d’lnvensfone appeared in 1761, featuring a series of drawings of prison interiors conceived on a titanic and overpowering scale. W’alpole, who had already converted his Twickenham home into a mockGothic castle, took from Piranesi the central image of his novel, a blackplumed helmet of monstrous size. Around it he gathered the now familiar cast of wronged and lovesick maidens, unhinged and tyrannical nobles, younger sons of ancient families travelling incognito. Among the male and female writers who followed in Wzalpole’s wake, some, apparently unwilling to commit themselves to the supernatural, rationalized their apparitions and so destroyed their credibility. Wzalpole went to the other extreme, decking his narrative lavishly with examples of the inexplicable. Otranto stands squarely in that Continental never-never land later to be staked out by Universal Studios and Hammer Films. Within its walls, the situation is ripe for calamity. Piranesi’s helmet merely serves to bring matters to a head. The castle’s lord, Prince Manfred, whose grandfather was granted tenure by the last of the original heirs, Alfonso the Good, is haunted by an enigmatic prophecy. When the ‘real owner’ of the castle grows too large to inhabit it, runs the message, Manfred’s family will be dispossessed. As he presses forward with the wedding of his sickly son, Conrad, and the daughter of the Marquis of Vicenza, Isabella, disaster strikes. Conrad is crushed beneath the suddenly materialized helmet, a gigantic replica of that worn by an effigy of Alfonso. At the same moment, the original vanishes. Hippolita, Manfred’s wife, is unable to bear him another child. He resolves to marry Isabella himself. Meanwhile, he imprisons an impetuous young\n\n13\n\npeasant on a charge of using sorcery to kill Conrad. As Isabella retreats from his abrupt advances,the towering black plumes on the helmet rustle and sway, violently. Manfred is halted in his pursuit of her by the spectacle of the figure of his grandfather stepping from a portrait on the wall. Temporarily dis­ tracted by this novel phenomenon, he is too late to prevent Isabella from taking refuge in the vaults. Undeterred, he follows her. Traffic is already heavy down below. To his astonishment, he meets the young peasant, escaped from his prison, who in turn has met Isabella. He is diverted from this baffling underground episode by two knockabout comics, nominally household servants, who claim to have seen a colossal armoured leg in one of the castle galleries. Though he is cast in the role of oppressor, it is impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for Manfred as he charges off to greet this new manifestation. Scarcely has he done so before a troop of horsemen arrive, bearing an enormous sword, the property of a being straightfacedly referred to as The Knight of the Gigantic Sabre. False identities are endemic to the Gothic novel and Otranto is no excep­ tion. Stalwart youths in peasant garb cannot be taken at face value and any­ thing may be concealed by a monkish cowl, from displaced aristocracy to death’s-heads. Otranto has both. Characters show a marked inability to recog­ nize their next of kin in subdued lighting, usually with fatal or near-fatal results. As revelations and visitations multiply, Manfred ploughs on, tenaci­ ously hugging his resolve to perpetuate his line. Like Ted Hughes’s Iron Man, the spectral giant gathers to himself appendages, here a leg, there a hand, finally arising in majestic totality to provide a literally shattering climax. Walpole’s headlong dialogue, punctuated by hyphens, aptly suggests the terror and panic of the castle’s inhabitants but can be confusing in places. Occasionally a note of genuine horror is struck amid the creaking of the Gothic mechanisms. Though some of the finest flowerings of the genre were yet to come, including Melmoth and Dracula, Jane Austen and Thomas Peacock had skilfully parodied it with Nortbanger Abbey and Headlong Hall by 1818. There is enough evidence in Otranto to suggest that Walpole might have taken the joke more lightly than some of his doom-laden successors.\n\nFirst edition London: T.

Under the influence of the visionary architect Piranesi, its more affluent disciples surrounded themselves with mock-medieval trappings. Among that fraction of the population which could afford to live vicariously in the past instead of scrabbling for survival in the present, William Beckford was pre-eminent. Inheritor of a huge income derived from the labour of slaves on his father’s West Indian sugar plantations, he was said to be the richest man in England. He was also extravagant upon an heroic scale. The project which eventually sapped even his resources formed a fitting setting for ‘The Caliph’, as he was dubbed. Artistic talent combined with vast wealth produced Fonthill Abbey, a dream-palace which anticipated Cole­ ridge’s ‘Kubla Khan’ by a year. Twelve miles of wall enclosed a park orna­ mented with woods and lakes, surrounding a building in which forty-foot doors gave admission to halls crammed with beautiful and costly objects. Vathek, published a decade earlier, reads like a prospectus for the life which Beckford was to lead within his Xanadu. Unlike the standard Gothic romance, the novel draws heavily upon the Arabian Nights for inspiration. Vathek, a grandson of Haroun al Raschid, is outwardly a generous and affable Caliph, devoted to wordly pleasures. Only rarely does he manifest his anger, and then his baleful glance terrifies those upon whom it falls. In the service of his pleasure he builds five palaces, each designed to gratify one of the senses. A sixth structure, a tower ascended by means of 1,500 steps, offends Mahomet. Regarding it from Paradise, he pro­ phesies disaster for such overweening ambition. Beckford crowned Fonthill with a tower almost 300 feet high. Being built chiefly of wood, it fell without benefit of prophecy. Vathek’s tower is an instrument of his fatal curiosity, bringing him closer to t,he stars and portents of the heavens. They do not forewarn him of the arrival of his Fate, in the guise of a nameless and superlatively ugly Indian purveying strange merchandise. So singular are this traveller’s powers that Vathek pursues him, after many misadventures, to the brink of a great black chasm. There he is revealed as an agent of Eblis, the Devil, and proposes a bargain. Unable to resist the promised revelations of Infernal secrets, Vathek agrees to supply the Indian with the blood of fifty of his realm’s fairest boys, the sons of his viziers and grandees. Tricking them into approaching the chasm’s brink, he hurls them into the depths. Or so he thinks. Whereupon the shadowy gulf closes, shutting him out. 15\n\nPursued bv his infuriated subjects and vassals, he retreats to the sanctuary of his tower. Carathis, his mother, a fearsome Greek matron, takes the situ­ ation in her stride. As a keen student of the black arts, she decides that further sacrifices are the answer. Soon a bonfire of disinterred mummies and freshly strangled citizens is blazing merrily. The offering is accepted and Vathek regains the favour of Eblis. Contented, he returns to his favourite form of recreation, eating. So far, the parallels between author and character are plain enough. Both were deprived of their fathers at an early age; both inherited vast fortunes, which they used to translate their visions into reality; both, if Beckford’s envious critics can be believed, had perverse tastes. Vathek now moves into regions denied to the merely rich, where only Beckford’s fancy, steeped in Oriental imagery, could follow. Obeying Eblis, the Caliph organizes a magnificent caravanserai with which to approach the gates of the underworld. He has been warned not to turn aside along the way, but is diverted by the hospitality of the Emir Fakrcddin and his lissom daughter, Nouronihar. Carathis, finding her son entangled with his new love, berates him for endangering his good standing with Eblis. Vathek defies her, and so seals Nouronihar’s doom. Together, they ride to Hell. Among modern masters of the ironic and macabre, Clark Ashton Smith comes readily to mind as a literary heir of Beckford. Lovecraft might have devised horrors to match those which inhabit the domain of Eblis, but only Smith could equal Beckford’s dark humour. As Nouronihar and the Caliph, hand in hand, enter the endless subterranean Fonthill, they gaze appalled upon throngs of the lamenting dead, whose hearts arc literally and visibly burning. The promised knowledge is theirs, but only fleetingly. Deciding that his upbringing by Carathis is the cause of his plight, Vathek uses his brief authority to summon her below. She arrives by Afrit and plunges enthusiasti­ cally into the Infernal afterlife, discounting her son’s recriminations. Soon, however, her heart is burning as agonizingly as any of them. Beckford was cast down from his custom-built Paradise by nothing more fiendish than bad management and the ending of the slave trade. He built himself a lesser palace near Bath, where he died at eighty-four and so added longevity to his ill-gotten gains.\n\nFirst edition London: J.

Add to it the fact that the perpetrator of these offences was twenty-one years old and you have Gregory ‘Monk' Lewis, a man for all frissons. Twenty years before his birth, the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 had shaken the foundations of orthodox Christianity in Western Europe. Was it an Act of God which brought down the city around the ears of the faithful on a day of worship or a device of Satan? Or, more frightful still, the chance blow of a blind, uncaring Universe? The question of which would be the greater impiety was only one of many troubling the philosophers of that revolutionary era. The shock, however, had not unseated Hypocrisy. Only when Lewis became a member of the legislature did his novel draw serious criticism. That the youthful author, bored with his minor diplomatic post in Holland, revelled in this outlet for his fantasies cannot be doubted. A gleeful mockery of the narrow monastic life surfaces time and again amid the welter of sadism, necrophilia, rape and incest. Those who profess celibacy exercise an unfailing fascination for the public imagination, inflamed by the high walls which make it impossible to watch them not At It. Lewis exploits this voyeuristic element to the full. Religious observance in the Convent of St Clare appears to consist largely of the browbeating of errant nuns, followed by their incarceration in those indispensable architectural adjuncts of Gothic fiction, the cellars. The ramifications of the cellars are matched by those of the narrative. Ambrosio, the Monk, spends long stretches in the wings, gnawing his beads, while supporting players take centre-stage. Eventually, however, all the strands of Lewis’s complex web of subplots are drawn together. Though Ambrosio tries to play the spider, he is in reality the most thoroughly entrapped of flies. Parted from his parents in early infancy, he has passed his formative years within the confines of the Church, knowing little of the world. His faith has the fragile inflexibility of a stained-glass window and the pressure which will reveal its flaws is already being applied. Satan obviously rates Ambrosio’s influence upon the people of Madrid very highly, for his scheme to overthrow the Monk is long laid and subtle. A painting of the Madonna, the only female image permitted by his religion, hangs in Ambrosio’s cell. Often in his cell too is the youthful novice Rosario,\n\n17\n\nwho professes admiration for him bordering on worship. This being a Gothic novel, beautiful young boys are not what they seem. Rosario confesses ‘him­ self to be Matilda and the model for the Madonna. Ambrosio, already conditioned by the painted image, is soon being introduced to his submerged sexual self by a suspiciously proficient Matilda. The versatile novice has a third aspect, yet to be revealed. She is a demon, an agent of Satan. The Monk is now firmly on the downward path. Having exhausted the charms of Matilda, or having been allowed to think that he has, he discovers a new inamorata. Antonia, a fair and impressionable virgin, admires him from her place in the cathedral. His compliant demon-mistress turns procuress to obtain her favours. The dashing Don Lorenzo also admires Antonia, but his path, as with all of the novel’s lovers, is destined to be rocky. Lorenzo’s sister, Agnes, is loved by his friend, Raymond, who is travelling incognito at the time. In a disastrous attempt at elopement, Raymond finds himself sharing a coach with the spectral Bleeding Nun. Not surprisingly, the coach crashes. The subsequent complications are resolved in an encounter with the Wander­ ing Jew, but Raymond recomplicates the relationship by pursuing Agnes to the Convent of St Clare. Agnes becomes pregnant. The Lady Prioress, feeling that convent discipline has become lax, resolves to make an example of her. From here on, though it may not seem possible, the plot thickens. Duels, illnesses—every one of the principals, save for Ambrosio and Matilda, suffers a nervous breakdown at some point murders, apparitions, graveyard worms, the full Gothic armoury is deployed with amazing deftness and vivacity by the nineteen-year-old author. More impressive than the charnelhouse apparatus is the way in which the Monk and his supporting cast emerge as characters who engage the reader’s sympathies. At the terrific climax, Ambrosio, driven by fear of the Inquisition into making a pact with the Devil, finds himself betrayed by God and Satan. In an involuntary aping of his infernal master’s fall from grace, he is hurled to his death upon eaglehaunted crags. As if providing an ironical coda to the Monk’s damnation, Lewis com­ promised with his critics by bowdlerizing later editions. Ambrosio would have appreciated that. First edition London: J.

Cobbett, 1798\n\n18\n\n[1818]\n\n5 MARY SHELLEY\n\nFrankenstein ‘An uncouth tale,’ said the Monthly Review in 1818, ‘setting probability at defiance’. ‘Hubris clobbered by Nemesis’ is the succinct definition of SF devised by Brian Aldiss. Yet the phrase applies equally well to Fantasy, and aptly describes Frankenstein. Science is the ostensible generative force behind Victor Frankenstein’s creation of an artificial man, but the Monster’s true origin lies in the alchemical texts which he was taught to despise. The odour of a Gothic charnel-house hangs about his labours from the beginning. His achievement is the réanimation of the dead rather than an electrochemical immaculate conception. Dramatizations of the story usually make no bones about this. No grave­ yard is left unturned in the vicinity of Frankenstein’s laboratory. In the series of films illuminated by Boris Karloff s powerful, if inaccurate, portrayal of the Monster, the visual aspects rise to grandiose heights. The original ill-lit, fetid chamber cluttered with chemical apparatus and unspeakable components gives way to reeling Expressionist towers thunderous with Promethean light­ nings. Only when Hammer Films injected new vigour into the flagging genre, incidentally setting it on a slippery slope to bloody mindlessness, did something of the huddled, pathological furtiveness of Frankenstein’s activi­ ties reach the screen. W here Hammer fell short was in the choice of an actor for the title-role. Peter Cushing was a convincing figure as a ruthless scientist driven beyond society’s limits of toleration by an unacceptable obsession. What he was not was the Romantic hero, young and idealistic, graceful of physique and spirit, yet fatally flawed. At one point, Mary Shelley has Frankenstein compare his plight to that of a fallen angel. Such comparisons, spoken or implied, echo throughout the text. He has usurped the Divine prerogative and must suffer accordingly. Frankenstein and the Monster would seem to be cast in the roles of pseudoGod and pseudo-Adam respectively. Yet it is the Monster which possesses inhuman strength and endurance, and the power to determine the fate of his creator. Man, as in Percy Bysshe Shelley’s later ‘Prometheus Unbound’, has made God in his own image. When Frankenstein first confronts his living handiwork, he flees from it in revulsion, no longer sustained by the frenzy of the creative act. The Monster, understandably enraged, resolves to wreak des­ truction upon him and his kin. Rejected by Man, it has become a God of Vengeance, all capacity for good destroyed by the withdrawal of love and recognition. 19\n\nWhen Mary began work upon Frankenstein in 1816, she was barely nineteen and had been Shelley’s lover for two years. He was in many ways the personi­ fication of the Romantic spirit: highly gifted, headstrong, iconoclastic, physi­ cally attractive. Like the young Victor, he had studied chemistry and mathematics, in his case in the teeth of academic disapproval. Latin and Greek were considered fitter subjects for a gentleman. Shelley, in fact, had mastered both of these subjects and in addition could out-quote his critics in the matter of Biblical studies. Given the intimacy of their relationship, signs of his influence upon Mary are to be expected, but her work after his death in 1822 refutes assertions that his was the dominant hand. The story of the agreement between Mary, Shelley, Byron and Byron’s physician, Dr Polidori, to write a tale of the supernatural is now almost as well known as her novel. Oddly, the enduring products of the agreement were written by the lesserknown participants. Polidori’s Fhe Vampyre is still obtainable and is no longer seriously attributed to Byron. Whatever elements of Shelley there may be in Victor Frankenstein, they do not include the poet’s tangled marital relationships. When he leaves Geneva for the University at Ingolstadt, Victor’s consuming passion is for know­ ledge; he has devoured the writings of such ancients as Paracelsus, Agrippa and Albertus Magnus. He is astounded to learn that their theories are obsolete and discredited, but this setback is only temporary. Soon he is out­ stripping his tutors in the sciences and applying their teachings to a search for the generating principle of Life, his private obsession. Mary Shelley’s account of the construction of the Monster is necessarily impressionistic rather than precise. Electricity the miracle-worker of the age-—chemistry, live animals and human cadavers figure in it, rather as writers of the 1930s invoked radium and cosmic rays to back up their flights of evolutionary fancy. Deserted by his creator, the Monster learns how to fend, for himself. He acquires clothing, literacy and a fluent command of language, through a series of happenstances made somewhat less implausible by being related in his own words. None of these attributes softens the terrifving effect of his size (he is eight feet tall, a fact which filmmakers seem reluctant to face) and over­ powering hideousness, which makes all sighted mankind his enemy. Goblin­ like, his deformities do not prevent him from moving with superhuman speed and agility as he pursues his vendetta against Frankenstein’s hapless family. As the climax approaches, Monster and Maker flee across the icebound terra incognita of the Arctic in an epic pursuit, each given purpose only by the presence of the other. In an age in which monsters have become acceptable industrial by­ products, even the illusion of effective individual action has a nostalgic charm.\n\nFirst edition\n\nAs Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus London: Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor & Jones, 1818 First US edition Philadelphia: Carey, 1833\n\n20\n\n[1820]\n\n6 CHARLES ROBERT MATURIN\n\nMelmoth the Wanderer 'Call me Melmoth,’ Oscar W ilde told the world as he sailed for France, bereft of fortune and reputation. In the manner of devotees of Fantasy the world over, he had adopted the identity of a fictitious personality in whom he saw aspects of himself reflected. Strangely, the personality was not a product of his own imagination, but that of another Irishman, Charles Maturin. Maturin’s Satanic reaver of souls came into being seventy-seven years before W ilde went into exile, yet his baleful influence lingered. It had long preceded W'ilde into France. Poe, Maturin and others of the Gothic school were highly regarded by the French, their works being trans­ lated almost as soon as they were published. Balzac wrote a sequel to Melmotlr, he was one of several prominent authors, including Sir Walter Scott, who gave praise and support to their Irish colleague. The original was adapted for the London stage, despite the Chinese-box complexity of its structure. That the terrible destiny of the W'anderer struck a responsive chord in Wilde is understandable; there is a touch of Melmoth in most artists, especially when the bills are due. Maturin found his own respectable Protestant origins lacking in romance. Amateur theatricals became a lifetime preoccupation, and he invented an ancestor, the love-child of a female French courtier who escaped to Ireland after incarceration in the Bastille. When he became a curate in order to ensure a steady income, his preaching packed the pews of St Peter’s in Dublin, but certain eccentricities of manner, combined with theologically suspect senti­ ments, barred his way to advancement. The picture he drew of Catholicism in Melmoth was marginally kinder than that in Lewis’s The Monk, yet scarcely an advertisement for any of the major brands of orthodox Christianity. Damned if you do and damned if you don’t appears to be the message. The involved narrative, sprouting branches like some malign family tree, begins in 1816 with the arrival of student John Melmoth at the decaying mansion of his dying uncle. Asked to open a locked room, he sees within a portrait bearing the legend ‘Jno. Melmoth, 1646’ and is stricken with horror by the expression of the eyes. His uncle’s assertion that the subject of the painting still lives adds to his disquiet. When the old man dies, among his effects is an ancient, discoloured MS. Alone in the shadowed chamber, in the sleeping, storm-swept house, John begins to read. The Melmoth of the portrait, his appearance unchanged down the years, is committed to Satan’s service. At moments of spiritual extremity, those unfor­ tunates who fall under his burning gaze are given a choice between whatever Earthly nemesis awaits them or the false salvation offered by his Master. If he\n\n21\n\ncan persuade one victim to take on his pact with the Devil in exchange for illusory freedom, Melmoth will be released from his hellish servitude. The novel is the story of his century-long and ultimately doomed search for such a victim. John Stanton (Maturin’s inventiveness did not seem to extend to masculine first names), the English author of the MS., meets the Wanderer in Spain, a location much favoured by novelists of the period. European civilization’s uttermost tip, a hand’s breadth removed from the pagan darkness of Africa, it furnished an arena for the heightened passions, murderous feuds, ruthless banditry and Inquisitorial atrocities beloved by their public. An old woman tells Stanton of the appearance at a wedding of a strange Englishman and the three deaths which followed. Her description of the man is familiar to Stan­ ton; they are destined to meet on two more occasions, the last with Stanton chained in a madhouse. From this point, the influence of the Wanderer spreads like an evil blight over the lives of young and old as he passes the barriers of time, space and the Inquisition’s dungeons with supernatural ease. Monsters are at their most fascinating when their nature is ambiguous. Melmoth is also a victim, destined for damnation more surely than those upon whom he preys. He is Satan’s black hound, who will sooner or later be called to heel. Alone on an island off the Indian coast lives white-skinned Immalee, knowing nothing of her origins. She is Eve unawakened, Melmoth’s spiritual opposite pole, and no more tempting quarry could be imagined. In the dual role of Adam and the Serpent, he invades her solitude, bringing news of the fabulous lands across the sea. Through diverse circumstances, Immalee is reunited with her prosperous Spanish parents, taking the name of Isidora. Still the Wanderer seeks to seduce her, unaware that he pursues his own destruction. As the story comes full circle, he returns to John Melmoth’s desolate mansion and is given a vision of the Inferno which awaits him. Maturin died at forty-three, accidentally poisoned. Of his many published plays and novels, only Melmoth continues to exert its grip upon the contem­ porary imagination. If he left any unpublished masterpieces behind him, they will remain unread, for his papers met the same fate as the W anderer, at the hands of his son.\n\nLondon: Hurst, Robinson & Co; & Edinburgh: Constable, 1820 First US edition Boston: Wells & Lilly, 1821\n\nFirst edition\n\n22\n\n[1838]\n\n7 EDGAR ALLAN POE\n\nThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Tym In recent decades, it has become increasingly difficult to disentangle the real Edgar Allan Poe from the creations of other writers’ imaginations. Few authors have proved so irresistible to literary and cinematic myth-makers. Son of an American actor and an English actress, orphaned and adopted, a failed student, a discharged West Point cadet, married at twenty-seven to a cousin barely half his age, he was dead at forty. Titillating mystery surrounded his death. Biographers and critics could choose between drink, epilepsy, or that popular 19th-century nemesis, brain fever, to mention only the more plausible causes. Roger Corman, Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury and Joseph Cotten, are a few of the names involved in re-creating the man and his fictions. Poe was extremely popular in France, and the equally uncertain fate of the hapless Arthur Gordon Pym seemed to exercise a similar fascination upon Jules Verne. Unable to resist the lure, he completed—to his own satisfaction at least the apparently unfinished story. His version appeared in 1897 as 'The Sphinx Of The Ice-Fields. The Antarctic remained a region of mystery, capable of accommodating the wildest of speculative fantasies, far beyond the time of Verne. In 1931, H.P. Lovecraft could, with confidence, use it as the setting for At The Mountains Of Madness, in which the cry of Poe’s great spectral birds, ‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!’ is echoed. It is, of course, the very ‘incompleteness’ of the novel which completes its effect. The climax is vertiginous, sweeping the reader to the brink of the unknown at an ever-accelerating pace. To bridge the gulf which lies beyond would inevitably be anti-climactic. Even so, it must be said that the opening stages of the story can be hard going, as much for the reader as for Pym. The omens, to put it mildly, are not auspicious. Young Pym, with the col­ lusion of a friend, stows away aboard the Grampus, a ship described as ‘an old hulk ... scarcely seaworthy.’ The crew are well-matched, being recruited from the same school of seamanship as that of Lord Greystoke’s Fuwalda, and consequently the body-count is high. Despite the wild oceanic setting and the unusual amount of violent action, Poe still finds opportunities to introduce the premature burial motif to great effect. The narrative, in fact, is crammed with the sort of incident common to the hag-ridden voyages of Gothic fic­ tion, interspersed with lectures upon natural history and seamanship. But for readers willing to press on through these occasional Sargassoes, there are 23\n\nbetter things to come. zXnyone who has read ‘Ms. Pound In A Bottle’ will readily recognize simi­ larities between the novel and this earlier short story. Both involve voyages, partly involuntary, to the terra incognita of the z\\ntarctic, voyages in which storms of supernatural ferocity are encountered and the crews of doomed ships. Most significantly, enigmatic messages occur in each in the short story, the single word ‘Discovery’ is written without conscious intent by the protagonist, while the novel describes gigantic hieroglyphs graven deep into the rocks of a strange black island. Both voyages reach a climax at which, hurled southwards by irresistible winds and currents, the characters face death, or revelation. It is when Pym reaches black Tsalal that the novel finally shakes off the cobwebbed trappings of lesser Gothics, and begins to truly grip. Tsalal is one in a chain of islands set in a warm sea in the far south of the world. Soil, rocks, vegetation, all are black. The native islanders are black from toenails to teeth. They abhor that which is white, so that, when allowed aboard Pym’s ship, a British schooner which rescued him and one other from the wrecked Grampus, they recoil from such commonplace objects as flour or the pages of an open book. The carcase of a strange white animal plucked from the sea by the British crew fills them with fear and horror. And in the end, their true attitude towards the white strangers becomes all too clear. Hunted and starving, Pym and his companion thread their way through the pit-like depths of the inexplicable hieroglyphs. After further desperate encounters with the Tsalalians, they put to sea in a stolen canoe, and are borne south. They enter a ‘region of novelty and wonder’. Above all, it is a region of whiteness, but not the whiteness of the Antarctic as we know it. The sea is warm and free of ice. Ribbons of vapour burst from the milky-hued waters, amid wild, flickering lights. As if in a trance, they sail on, insulated from apprehension or fear. Finally, the entire southern horizon becomes a mon­ strous cataract of pale vapour, endlessly falling, from out of which fly gigantic birds. At the very foot of the cataract, at the brink of the unknown, a towering figure of snowy whiteness confronts them. . . .

Charles Dickens was thirty-one when this short novel was pub­ lished, and the concept of Christmas as we understand it was no older. It is a mark of his genius that he stamped his version of the feast-day so deeply into the national consciousness that no celebration of it passes without some refer­ ence to his name. Equally enduring is the picture of Scrooge, the embodiment of grasping, grinding Victorian commerce, his very surname now synonymous with miserliness. So low is his spiritual temperature that the enshrouding London fog and nipping frost leave no mark upon him. z\\ppeals from charitable Christian gentlemen meet a heart of flint; the seasonal good wishes of his nephew only reinforce his contempt for such meaningless gestures. The absence of his clerk upon Christmas Day is a legalized imposition, a raid upon his pocket. This master of misanthropy receives his first hint of a come-uppance when his doorknocker metamorphoses into the face of his long-dead business partner, Jacob Marley. Clanking hard after it comes Jacob in his ghostly entirety, shattering Scrooge’s attempts to resume his usual domestic routine. A ponderous chain drags behind the spectre, composed of all the apparatus of business which occupied his working life. A greater chain, he groans, is already attached to Scrooge. At Marley’s instigation, Scrooge has been granted a chance to redeem himself before it is too late. He will be visited by three Spirits, from whom he may learn the error of his ways. Not unnaturally, Scrooge would prefer to forgo salvation by ordeal and take his chances with the afterlife. He is given no choice. The Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future arrive on schedule to give him a con­ ducted tour of his life as it was and as it might come to be. Along with him went the Victorian reader, presented with a kaleidoscopic vision of the middle and working classes celebrating the birth of their Saviour. It is a wholly secular vision, for all of its religious overtones; church and chapel do not figure in it. Nor do Christmas trees, crackers, stockings or Santa Claus. As researchers have shown, these familiar trappings of the festive season were either unknown in 1843 or just beginning to infiltrate the upper reaches of society. Also, there is little that is Christian about them, for all the popular notion of 25\n\nVictorian religiosity. The Spirit of Christmas Present, with his capacious robes and abundance of food and drink, is an early prototype of Santa Claus. To Scrooge’s horror, the robes, when drawn aside, reveal the stunted children of Man, the girl Want and the boy Ignorance. Dickens, inspired by a visit to Manchester’s satanic mills, had a point to make, and the ugliness of social injustice glowers through the bustling good humour of his tale. A story-teller first and foremost, he never forgets the humanity of his central character. Through the Ghost of Christmas Past and the words of Scrooge’s younger sister, we see him a virtual refugee from his unhappy home-life, spending a solitary Christmas at a boarding-school. His apprentice­ ship to a warehouse owner provides one of those scenes of festivity in which the energy of Dickens’s prose leaves the reader almost as breathless as the dancers. The relief is only temporary. Gold becomes his ruling passion as all human connections beyond the counting-house fade away. Only a reputation for being a man of his word remains, and his word is unforgiving. Because the timespan of the story is confined to one night, Scrooge’s defensive shell of callousness crumbles with unconvincing rapidity. Admit­ tedly, it is subjected to extraordinary pressures, particularly from the Spirit of Christmas Future. Dickens’s relish for a good stiff dose of spectral horror drives the beleaguered miser from deathbed to graveyard and a preview of a friendless, unmourned passing. In death he becomes the helpless object of the profit motive at its starkest, at the hands of people who cannot afford the luxury of ethics. Is it a taste of things to come or one of several possible paths? As with most of Dickens’s novels, A Christmas Carol is probablv best known through film, television or radio dramatizations. In an age which prefers the fuzzy reassurance of‘Goodwill to All Men’ to the more exacting ‘Peace to Men of Goodwill’, his Victorian phantasmagoria tends to degener­ ate into a cosy fairy-tale, its darknesses glossed over or eliminated. ‘This boy,’ says the Spirit of Christmas Present, ‘is Ignorance . . . beware, for on his brow I see written Doom.’ That problem hasn’t gone awav overnight.\n\nAs A Christmas Carol in Prose, being a Ghost Story of Christmas First edition London: Chapman & Hall, 1843 First US edition New York: Harpers, 1844\n\n26\n\n[1847]\n\n9 EMILY BRONTE\n\nWuthering Heights To attempt to convey an impression of the darkness at the heart of Wuthering Heights is to face the fact that Charlotte Bronte did so first, and did it better. Editing the second edition of her younger sister’s only novel, she wrote: ‘It is moorish and wild, and knotty as a root of heath ... in its storm-heated and electrical atmosphere, we seem at times to breathe lightning .. .’ Of the darkbrowed Heathcliff: ‘. . . he was child neither of Lascar nor gypsy, but a man’s shape animated by demon life—a Ghoul—an Afreet.’ Of the novel, again: ‘He [it was published under the pseudonym ‘Ellis Bell’] wrought from no model but the vision of his meditations . . . the crag took human shape .. . colossal, dark and frowning ... yet ... its colouring is of mellow grey and moorland moss clothes it.’ Charlotte, Emily, Anne and brother Branwell were the products of an unlikely literary forcing-house, Haworth Parsonage, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Whatever help and guidance the people of Haworth got from the Rev Bronte, they saw little enough of his children by Charlotte’s account. The surviving siblings (two older sisters had died in 1825) shared an intense, secretive life of the imagination nurtured upon the Arabian Nights, Sir Walter Scott and the wild sublimity of John Martin’s haunted panoramas. Branwell’s prospects as a painter evaporated in a fog of opium, alcohol and depression; in a group portrait of the four, he has painted himself out and hovers behind the sisters like an ectoplasmic presence. Sickness and death were constant companions of the Brontes and their father’s parishioners. The prospect from the parsonage windows began with the crowded cemetery. Infant mortality was high in the steep terraces of Haworth, as it was in most of Britain’s burgeoning industrial centres. Tuberculosis flourished under the wide skies of the Yorkshire moorland. The Rev Bronte saw it carry off Branwell, Emily and Anne; a widower for forty years, he outlived all six of his children. Only Charlotte married, but she died during her first pregnancy. It was amid these relentless reminders of physical decay and the intimations of a new age of regimented labour that Wuthering Heights was conceived. Charlotte, as enthralled as any anonymous reader by her sister’s dark fancies, wondered whether: ‘. . . it is right or advisable to create beings like Heathcliffe ... I scarcely think it is.’ What sort of being he was is still debated. Mr Lockwood, who rents Thrushcross Grange from Heathcliff, begins under a misapprehension about his temperament, but learns rapidly at the hands, paws and fangs of the Wuthering Heights household and their dogs. Trapped there by a blizzard, he is grudgingly allowed to stay overnight. 27\n\nHeathcliff is unaware that he has been given a room which once belonged to Catherine, daughter of the late owner of the house, Mr Earnshaw. During a frightening dream, he puts a hand through the window to still the tapping of a tree-branch and instead touches the ice-cold fingers of a child. A girl’s voice cries that it is Catherine Linton, come home from the moor. Screaming as he wakes, he arouses Heathcliff, who is simultaneously terrified and enraged. Wrenching open the window, Heathcliff calls out to the unseen presence. Back at Thrushcross Grange, Lockwood wheedles more information out of an ex-servant of the Earnshaws, Mrs Dean. She recalls Mr Earnshaw returning from a visit to Liverpool, carrying a dirty, black-haired child he claims to have rescued from a solitary life in the streets. He christens it ‘Heathcliff. His son, Hindley, hates it, but Catherine, his daughter, soon befriends it. As her father’s health declines, his regard for the foundling becomes obsessive. The tension between Heathcliff, Catherine and Hindley intensifies as the years pass. When Hindley becomes master of the house, Heathcliff is rele­ gated to the status of servant. The appearance of a rival for Catherine, Edgar Linton, precipitates a crisis. Heathcliff leaves, but returns mysteriously wealthy. Becoming Edgar’s wife has not lessened Catherine’s passionate affinity for her adoptive brother. It becomes obvious that a resolution of the triangular relationship cannot be found this side of the grave. Hollywood, baffled by an extra-marital affair unconsummated even by implication, com­ promised by showing the deceased lovers ascending hand in hand to a cloudy apotheosis, proving that Heaven and the Hays Code condoned infidelity so long as you got no fun out of it. Speculation about Heathcliff is as endless as the question of the location of Dr Watson’s war-wound. What was the unexplained purpose behind Mr Earnshaw’s journey to Liverpool sixty miles each way, on foot, from which he returned with a foundling and a few toys for his children? What was the child’s strange influence upon his dying foster-father? Demon, changeling or social misfit, Emily Bronte’s furious creation continues to haunt and provoke the imagination.

You arc caught up, as he was, in a pursuit not of your making, drawn resistlessly in the wake of Leviathan, plunged into a vortex and cast out again, spent. In the course of the quest you will have learned the perilous art of harpooning and butchering a creature with blood as hot as your own, but great enough to dwarf the rep­ tilian monsters of antiquity. ‘Anything down there about your souls?’ asks the seaman Elijah, after hearing that lshmael and Queequeg the harpooner have signed on board the whaler Pequod under Captain Ahab. lshmael concludes uneasily that Elijah is ‘a little damaged in the head’. On the morning on which he and Queequeg go to join their ship, Elijah crosses their path again, like a disciple of the Ancient Mariner, saying: ‘Did ye see anything like men going towards that ship?’ Queequeg has not seen them, but lshmael admits to noticing some misty figures heading that way. Once aboard, they find no one but a sleeping rigger. Ahab remains hidden until the Pequod is out to sea. When he appears, he lives up to everything that lshmael has been told of him. A livid scar runs from out of his grey hair and down the full length of his face and neck, like the brand of lightning upon a stricken tree. An encounter with the white whale, Moby-Dick, has torn away one leg, to which a stump of whale-ivory has been attached. A ‘grand, ungodly, god-like man’, as Captain Peleg describes him, he has become moody and savage, living only to track down and destroy his enemy. It is as if the ivory links them by a form of sym­ pathetic magic, binding his fate and that of his crew to his ever-receding quarry. There was something of lshmael in Melville. A decline in family fortunes and the death of his father in 1832 led him to seek work as a teacher, a bank clerk and finally a seaman. Pedburn, his fourth novel, was inspired by his first voyage, to England. On his second he jumped ship in the South Seas and lived among the Polynesian cannibals. American friends persuaded him, on his return, to write of his experiences. The result was Fypee. Its reception encouraged him to produce a sequel, Qmoo. Marriage and fatherhood brought financial pressures; Melville’s books were no bestsellers. For a time he sold fiction to magazines, a less risky source of income. Moby-Dick, perhaps not so widely read as widely known is generally regarded as his finest work, with the possible exception of Billy Budd, Foretopman. Melville still had forty years to live when Moby Dick was published, but he gained little more from it in terms of fame or cash than from Billy Budd, which was published posthumously. The symbolism embodied in the white 29\n\nwhale has probably generated more words than he ever wrote, but the ranks of the analysts have yet to present us with an Ahab. The British and American public, confronted by a massive volume seem­ ingly compounded of metaphysics and the mechanics of whaling, for the most part refused to dig deeper. Depressed and exhausted, Melville struggled on in obscurity. For twenty years he worked as customs officer, meanwhile composing verse, which, like Billy Budd, would not be read until after his death. So long-drawn-out and anticlimactic a conclusion to his life is strangely at odds with the energy which suffuses the near 700 pages of Moby-Dick. The sense of space it conveys is vast; no galaxy-spanning epic of SF so captures a feeling of depth, distance and the weight of Time. Melville’s prose gives an Old Testament solemnity and grandeur to the awesome details of the whaling business: the carving of immensities of flesh, rendering down of rivers of blubber, demolishing of cathedrals of bone. Before Time began, says Ishmael-Melville, the whole world was the whale’s. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s. But soon he is quoting the Nantucket captains, who even then foresaw the whale’s extermination. Not unreason­ ably for a man of his time, he finds the prophecy implausible. Quartermain may have felt the same way about elephants. ‘To be enraged with a dumb thing seems blasphemous,’ declares Starbuck, mate of the Pequod. ‘All visible objects,’ Ahab replies, ‘are as masks ... If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall. . . . Sometimes, I think there’s naught beyond. Talk not to me of blasphemy ... I’d strike the sun if it insulted me.’ Nothing in Ahab’s life so becomes him as the manner of his dying. It is magnificently arrogant, supremely nihilistic. If there can be such a thing as inverted blasphemy, Ahab is guilty of it. He seeks to usurp the prerogative not of God but of Lucifer.

SHERIDAN LEFANU\n\nUncle Silas: a Tale Of Tartram-Tiaugh Uncle Silas begins with a defensive foreword by the author which, at this remove, only serves to show how critical attitudes can change. The term ‘sen­ sation novels’, apparently applied to LeFanu’s books, is rejected by him; he points out that Sir Walter Scott’s work had not been so labelled, despite its generous quota of crime and bloodshed. Readers whose sensibilities have been bludgeoned by today’s meat-market school of horror writers may find the blood and violence in Uncle Silas barely detectable. Earlier Gothic writers, conversely, might consider the corridors of Bartram-Haugh woefully lacking in clanking chains and headless nuns. LeFanu was no stranger to the business of professional criticism. During his writing career he was both journalist and editor, as well as an outstanding teller of fantastic tales in a country noted for them, Ireland. Stories such as The White Cat of Drumgunniol mine the rich lode of Irish legend and super­ stition, but Uncle Silas is set, for the most part, in rural Derbyshire. This is the countryside of the squirearchy and their huge, rambling houses, to which the surrounding landscape and its inhabitants are little more than appendages. Bartram-Haugh is a peculiarly inhospitable example of the type, reflecting the character of its reclusive master, Silas Ruthyn. The narrator is Maud Ruthyn, adolescent daughter of Silas’s older brother. Though she has never met her uncle, a portrait of him as a young man has fixed him firmly in her imagination, aided by guarded hints from her father regarding his brother’s dissolute youth. The comfortable tranquillity of her life at Knowl is enlivened by this romantic figure, until other and less welcome events intrude. Her undemonstrative but affectionate father, a widower, is visited by Dr Bryerly, a disciple of the Swedish philosophertheologian Swedenborg. Mr Ruthyn left the Church of England to become a Swedenborgian, an act deplored, if little understood, by his household and Maud. Acutely class-conscious, they are not reassured by the enigmatic Doctor, who dresses like an artisan while enjoying the status of a gentleman. Afterwards, Maud’s father tells her that he may have to go on a journey, but he will not reveal his destination. It is with Mr Ruthyn’s announcement that Maud is to have a new teacher that a great grotesque enters the story. Madame de la Rougierre first appears in the moonlight like an apparition, cackling and gesticulating, to Maud’s justifiable alarm. Closer acquaintance does not improve her. Tall, sallow,\n\n31\n\nhollow-cheeked, draped in purple silk, she careers through the narrative, dis­ pensing a mixture of hypocrisy, spurious benignity and vindictiveness, fuelled by brandy. Only when she is caught rifling his desk does the remote Mr Ruthyn see what has long been plain to everyone else and send her packing. Fortunately for the reader, she returns. The air darkens. Maud’s father takes the journey he warned her of—die dies of heart disease. His will makes Silas her guardian, until she reaches twentyone. She must leave Knowl till then and reside at Bartram-Haugh, taking only her maid, Mary Quince. From her home, with its legends of haunted galleries, Maud goes to a truly haunted house, of which her uncle is the pre­ siding spirit. The silver-haired, spectral presence of Silas Ruthyn dominates the narrative from this point onwards; his ambivalent attitude towards his niece, his recurrent laudanum-induced ‘illnesses’, the hostile aura radiating from his servants, induce an atmosphere of uncertainty and dread. When he is not sunk in a laudanum stupor, Uncle Silas is scheming to marry off Maud to his raffish son, Dudley, so as to restore the family fortunes. Dudley, an associate of the sporting fraternity and a handy man with his knuckles, is less accomplished in the role of suitor. He and his sister have none of their father’s social graces; motherless, they have been left to their own devices, picking up such education as they can. It becomes plain, even to Dudley, that marriage is not on the cards. Silas, long ostracized by county society since the suspicious disappearance of a colleague and guest, does not baulk at murder as an alternative. Maud, though feeling increasingly threat­ ened by her guardian’s restrictions upon her movements beyond BartramHaugh, does not suspect his darker pupose. Only her much older cousin, Lady Monica Knollys, and the mysterious Dr Bryerly are sensible of the real danger. The shadows thicken in the dusty, deserted corridors of Bartram-Haugh as Silas spins his intricate web of deceit and avarice. Maud, seeking the room in which the alleged murder was committed, stumbles upon a secret yet more sinister. LeFanu tightens his grip upon the reader’s nerves, screwing up the tension page by page, springing surprises like a diabolical conjurer. If Maud, in retrospect, seems a little too naive, even for her age and sheltered upbring­ ing, in the presence of so palpable an evil, the fault is a minor one. Uncle Silas remains a classic of its kind, as even Swedenborgians might agree.

The symptoms can include anything from social embarrassment to psychological destruction. Life becomes a permanently tilted seesaw, on which no amount of adult striving can counterbalance the weight of that small alien figure at the other end. It can even be contagious. A Sunday Supplement magazine carried an advertisement offering prints of two photographs of Victorian children at £137 the pair. The photographer was the Rev Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, who conferred immortality upon Alice Liddell with book and camera. And, by association, upon any other pre-pubescent girl who posed for him. The Church, as a shelter for the talented, the intellectual or the simply eccentric, was still a thriving institution in his lifetime. Dodgson, math­ ematician, writer and accomplished amateur photographer, is only one of its better-known disciples. Alice’s father, Henry Liddell, domestic chaplain to the Prince Consort, compiled the massive Greek Lexicon, the first truly efficient linguistic tool for translating from the Greek. In a society engaged in aping Hellenic art and culture, not least as an acceptable language for the expression of eroticism, it sold out quickly. The chaplaincy was not Liddell’s only link with Britain’s blue blood; he was kin to a baron, an earl and the family of a future queen, Elizabeth Bowes Lyon. According to some researchers, Dodgson may have proposed marriage to his well-connected Alice. Fewer eyebrows would have been raised by the age disparity than might be imagined; the forcible transition from childhood to adult responsibilities occurred at more than one level of Victorian society. Their relationship had begun in Oxford in 1856. Alice was almost four when Dodgson and a friend came to photograph the Liddells’ home, the Deanery. At his suggestion, she and her sisters were included in the foreground of the picture. Six years and many meetings, stories, jokes and photographs later, came the momentous boating trip and picnic which saw the birth of Alice. The fact that the story was extemporized while Dodgson was occupied in rowing a boat may account for the episodic nature of the early chapters. After the slow, dream-like fall down the rabbit-hole, there follows a sequence of changes in size brought about by magical drinks or stones which meta­ morphose into cakes. These events have an air of having been devised to keep things moving, with no clear notion of a destination. The constrictions of the subterranean setting (the original MS, half the length of the published 33\n\nversion, was entitled Alice s Adventures Underground) are soon abandoned in favour of something resembling the upper world. Appearances could not be more deceptive. The fauna, consisting, among other creatures, of March Hares and Dormice, Gryphons and Mock-Turtles, show an alarming tendency to talk back, volubly and aggressively. Words, following the example of the venerable Father William, stand on their heads to confound commonsensical Alice. If Tenniel’s illustrations sometimes make her look like an adult in children’s dress, her behaviour reinforces the image. She is, in miniature, one of those nineteenth-century ladies who outfaced the heathen in far, strange corners of Empire. By the time the first ‘Alice’ book had wedded the Reverend and the Dean’s daughter in the public’s mind, Dodgson was no longer welcome at the Liddell home. Could the hypothetical proposal have been responsible for this? Whatever the reason, he contrived to keep in touch with the children. Alice was nineteen when the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, appeared. She received a specially bound copy to take its place beside its predecessor. Six years had elapsed between the two books. Many of the original readers were children no longer and a new generation of potential readers had sprung up. Those adults who had shared in their children’s enjoyment in 1865 greeted Looking-Glass with enthusiasm, perhaps finding an additional intellec­ tual pleasure in the fact that it was based upon chess-moves. In just over a month, sales had reached 15,000 copies. The name ‘Lewis Carroll’, adopted when the young Dodgson began contributing short pieces to magazines, was now world-famous. The sequel has the feel of a more considered work, the difference being apparent in the opening pages. Carroll, no longer catering for an audience surrounded by the distractions of a river trip, had less need of literary fire­ works to hold their attention. Tenniel had agreed to illustrate it, not without some reluctance, for Carroll could be an exacting taskmaster where his book’s appearance was concerned, despite his diffident manner. The result was another set of superbly grotesque visualizations, including an horrific Jabberwock. Looking-Glass is as rich as Alice in memorable characters and quotable lines, many of which have become indispensable parts of the Englishspeaking world’s vocabulary. On the far side of the Looking-Glass, Space and Time are mutable, for those who know the secret. To quote Alice and Humpty Dumpty: “One can’t help growing older.” “Oz/i’ can’t . . . but two can. With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.” Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland First edition London: Macmillan, 1865 First US edition New York: Appleton, 1866 Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There First edition Macmillan, 1871 (but dated 1872) First US edition New York: Macmillan, 1872 34\n\n[1884]\n\n13 EDWIN A. ABBOTT\n\nFlatland Most readers, if asked to name a nineteenth-centurv mathematician, clergy man and fantasist, would probably plump for Lewis Carroll. Without doubt, his Alice stood head and pinafore above the competition, but competition there was. Almost twenty years after Alice fell for a White Rabbit, Edwin A. Abbott introduced the denizens of Elatland to our three-dimensional world, in the guise of ‘A Square'. Despite Abbott’s religious affiliations, his book treats the Church and Victorian society in general with some irreverence. Among his gifts was that of knowing when to stop. The main text of Flatland runs to just under 100 pages: just enough to leave the reader wishing for more. Brevitv is not a quality usually associated with the Victorians or, for that matter, with today’s fantasy millers, but Abbott’s slender joke is never spun out beyond its innate capacity. Like Alice, ‘A Square’ falls out of his own world into a baffling, even terrifving, place where natural laws seem to be set at naught. Unlike her, he becomes so enamoured of Spaceland and its hints of multidimensional spaces beyond, that he is reluctant to return to depthless Elatland. When he does so, he cannot resist the urge to expand upon the glories of the Solid state, and is arrested for preaching sedition. In gaol, he passes the years by writing Flatland, A Romance of Many Dimensions. To imprison anyone in this world of two dimensions, or to enclose them for any purpose, it is only necessary to surround them with a line. All struc­ tures are exercises in planar gometry, their forms defined by social custom. Society is as rigidly ordered as the shapes of the beings who comprise it. The concept of a third dimension, of height, exists but is not publicly discussed. Unknown to the general populace, a manifestation of Higher Space occurs once every millennium, in the High Council chamber. The Counsellors studiously ignore it. The entity responsible is the Sphere, who transported ‘A Square’ into Spaceland. The narrator belongs to the professional classes, being a lawyer with a talent for mathematics. Professional men are Squares; professional gentlemen are Pentagons. Soldiers and lower-grade workmen are Isosceles Triangles with narrow bases; the middle class are Equilateral Triangles. The nobility begin as Hexagons, rising in eminence as the number of their sides increases, until they are Polygonal. When they are sufficiently many-sided to be indis­ tinguishable from Circles, they become members of the priestly order. As for women, they are all Straight Lines. Intelligence being a function of the individual’s angle, with the acutely angled Soldiers ranking lowest on the scale and the Circles highest, it can be appreciated that someone devoid of 35\n\nangles is in a bad way mentally. Women are, therefore, much deadlier than men. Movement in Flatland is governed by complex rules, their prime purpose being to avoid impaling fellow-citizens upon one’s apex. Straight Lines combine brainlessness with two murderously sharp points; add to this their tendency to hysteria and a woman becomes a force to be reckoned with. It is hardly surprising that the preface to the second edition includes a somewhat tongue-in-cheek apologia on behalf of ‘A Square’ regarding his attitude to the fair sex. Abbott’s solution to problems of recognition (plane figures see each other edge-on, appearing merely as straight lines) is ingenious; their leading edges are luminous. Where the edges recede, as from the apex of a triangle, the luminosity fades with distance. Once, in a past age, this distinction was almost obliterated by an artistic revolution. Chromatistes, a pioneer in a markedly unaesthetic society, experimentally painted his house and family, creating a wholly new means of identification. So universal was its appeal that soon only the extremes of society women and Circles = remained colourless. There was a violent reaction against this seditious movement. Chromatistes was slain amid a general massacre of the multicoloured. Orthodoxy reasserted itself and the practice of painting was forbidden. Flatland, surprisingly, has weather. A slight gravitational pull towards the south enables rain to fall across the surface. What happens to the water after that is not too clear. The source of daylight, on the other hand, is something that even the wisest Circle has been unable to determine. Some future Galileo will doubtless discover it, and suffer accordingly, since it involves the Third Dimension. ‘A Square’, a respectable lawyer, became intoxicated with the view from Spaceland to such a degree that he could not restrain himself from uttering heresies. Flatland is one of those rare fantasies which educate, painlessly, while they entertain. Geometry textbooks might profit from a touch of the same leaven­ ing wit. The same degree of social comment would surely have them bluepencilled, and not only in Victoria’s Britain.\n\nAs by ‘A. Square’ First edition London: Seeley & Co, 1884 First US edition Boston: Roberts, 1885\n\n36\n\n[1886]\n\n14 HENRY RIDER HAGGARD\n\nShe One of the incidental pleasures of Victorian fantasy lies in the picture it can present, unwittingly, of the writer’s view of his world. In She, Rider Haggard confronts his readers with pages of classical Greek, old English, and medieval Latin, en route to the action. Did he believe he was catering for a classicallyeducated public numerous enough to ensure a profit? Or were his publishers willing to indulge the author of ATz'z/g Solomon s Alines, hoping that the masses would simply skip the erudite passages? In the end, they were no obstacle to sales, which rose to 25,000 within a few weeks. What the readers got was a novel-length exercise in the macabre. If it is true that fantasy attracts us by making our deepest fears palatable, even enjoy­ able, then She caters admirably for our fear of death. Along with the macabre element runs an allied strain of misogyny, a not unfamiliar quality in Haggard’s characters. The story is narrated by Horace Holly, a Cambridge student whose sole friend has committed suicide, leaving a five-year-old son, Leo Vincey. Holly, a misogynist at twenty-two owing to a disastrous and expensive affair, takes on the guardianship of the child at his friend’s request. Modern readers may doubt his suitability for the role when, discovering that an elderly don is luring the golden-haired child to his rooms with gifts of sweets, he forbids the relationship on dietary grounds. Leo, however, attains the age of twentyfive unscathed, and is shown the mysterious legacy left by his father. The strange story revealed by the documents and relics comprising the legacy, of an ageless woman ruling a hidden land in Africa, is irresistible to Leo. Holly reluctantly accompanies his ward, together with an equally miso­ gynistic manservant, Job. The voyage ends in shipwreck, but the travellers discover that their arrival was foreseen. They are taken inland by the Amahagger, a race of surly cannibals, who prove to be subjects of the legendary She described in the legacy. Amahagger women are free to choose their own husbands, a custom which distresses Job, and eventually leads to tragedy for Ustane, the girl who chooses Leo. A comical episode involving Job and a marriage-minded lady ends in the murdering of the European’s Arab companion and the wounding of Leo, before Billali, She’s representative, can quell the cannibals. Holly, Job, Ustane and the dying Leo go with Billali to the mountain stronghold of She. During the trek, Holly saves Billali from drowning, an incident which has important repercussions, but which he describes in almost farcical terms. The mountain, when reached, is the entrance to a veritable subterranean world, part natural, part the prodigious creation of an extinct 37\n\npre-Egyptian race, the Kor. With the stone won in its excavation a city was built, itself now fallen into ruin, and the farms of She’s subjects have been walled about. At this point, the combination of Haggard’s love of Africa with his interest in agriculture threatens to swamp the story. Within the mountain, in millennia-long seclusion, lives Ayesha, She-who-must-be-obeyed. Lives, or is buried? Holly’s first sight of the robed figure of Ayesha reminds him of ‘a corpse in its graveclothes’. The terrified Job describes ‘a corpse a-coming . . . down the passage’ as She approaches with her eerily graceful walk. Her palace is part of the burial and torture chambers of dead Kor, in which she preserves the body of Kallikrates, the Greek whom she murdered two thousand years ago because he loved another woman. The mummified dead of the ancient empire are all about her, in their thousands. So plentiful are they, and so accustomed are the Amahagger to their presence, that they are burned as torches to light the weird and gloomy festivals of the cannibals. Thus entombed by her own choice, She, despite her occult powers and intelligence, has resigned herself to awaiting the reincarnation of the slain Kallikrates, who alone can absolve her from guilt by acknowledging her love. Leo, of course, is the living double of Kallikrates. When Ayesha has healed his wounds and used her powers to dispose of Ustane, she reveals that the source of her ageless beauty lies in a flame springing from the depths of the Earth. To persuade Leo to bathe in the fires, she goes before him, repeating her two-thousand-years past immersion. Everyone knows what happens next . . . but the scene never loses its fascination. Two millennia of spiritual death manifest themselves in one awful moment. The world may have been spared z\\yesha’s long-brewed plans for conquest —but one can only regret that she never achieved her ambition to confront that other durable She, Queen Victoria.\n\nAs She; a History of Adventure First edition New York: Harpers, 1886 First UK edition London: Longmans, 1887\n\n38\n\n[1886]\n\n15 ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON\n\nDr jekyll and Mr Hyde Faced with a resolutely virginal expanse of white paper, an author might well envv Stevenson’s ability to dream whole chapters of a story. Whether the screaming nightmares which accompanied the experience were an acceptable price to pay is another matter. Tuberculosis, that devouring muse of so many creative artists, dictated the manner of his adult life, driving him to seek relief in other climates. It was during a long spell of illness that he dreamed the opening episodes of the most famous tale of addiction since Confessions of an Opium Eater. In its present form the story represents Stevenson’s second attempt to translate his nightmare into words. After reacting angrily to criticism from his wife, he cooled off, agreed that she was right and promptly burned the original 40,000-word manuscript. It may be that Mrs Stevenson was right, but it is hard not to deplore that impetuous act. That first version might have been closer to the raw material of his dreams. As his friend Henry James remarked, whatever Stevenson thought of women in his everyday life, he seemed to find them an encumbrance in his fiction. /Vnyone coming to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with memories of numerous film adaptations will be struck by their total absence, save in minor roles. The doctor is a tall, well-built man of fifty who possesses a ‘quarter of a million sterling’ and a large, tastefully appointed house, yet there is no mention of a wife, fiancee, mistress or any other form of female companionship at any stage of his life. This deficiency applies to every one of the chief figures. When Jekyll speaks of his secret pleasures, which he describes as ‘undig­ nified’, we are left to imagine them for ourselves. Mr Hyde’s unrestrained pursuit of evil is no more specific than ‘drinking pleasure .. . from any degree of torture to another’. Shades of Dorian Gray. Jekyll’s dilemma, as he sees it, is not that his misdeeds are grievous; he does not find them so. What he cannot bear is that they must exist in tandem with his loftier aspirations. He dreams of having two identities, each pursuing its individual bent untroubled by man’s duality. Long researches, condemned by a fellow-doctor, Lanyon, as ‘unscientific balderdash’, uncover a chemical key to the problem. Drug-induced modifications of personality are common currency today, but they didn’t prove acceptable to some critics in 1886. Jekyll establishes that the body is a projection of the spirit; separate out the baser component of the spirit and allow it to become dominant and the body will reflect the change. After the tranformation he is smaller and youngerlooking and feels ‘a heady recklessness ... I knew myself... to be ... tenfold more wicked ... a slave to my original evil.’ 39\n\nJckyll’s servants have instructions to allow Hyde the run of the house. Stevenson points up the dichotomy in the doctor’s character by situating the house in a row of properties which are going down the social scale; only his retains its air of dignified prosperity. Enfield, a friend of Jckyll’s lawyer, Utterson, sees Hyde knock down and trample a young girl who collides with him one night. With the help of some neighbours, he forces him to agree to compensate her family for the fright she has received. Hyde leads them to a door in an otherwise featureless housefront, from which he re-emerges with a cheque in Jekyll’s name. Stevenson, without describing Hyde in physical detail, suggests the abnormality of undi­ luted evil through the fear and murderous rage it arouses in the people who apprehend him. Passing that door some time later with Mr Utterson, Enfield tells his story without mentioning Jekyll’s name, only to learn that the lawyer already knows of the connection. The tale unravels to its horrific yet pathetic conclusion. The impact of Dr jekyll and Mr Hyde upon the Victorians was immediate and lasting. Published in January, it had sold 40,000 copies by July. Several plays were based upon it. It became the subject of sermons. Queen Victoria may or may not have been amused by it, but she read it. No doubt there were some who saw, beyond the fascinating struggle between darkness and light, a wider application to society as a whole. Trampling was one of the lesser brutalities undergone by London’s pre-pubescent girls in return for the gold of respectable Jckylls. Stevenson and his family sailed for America in 1887, unaware of how fame had preceded them. The ship’s pilots who came aboard as they approached New York introduced themselves as Jekyll and Hyde. Reporters surrounded Stevenson before he could disembark. He was showered with requests to write articles for what he considered to be absurdly large fees. Fees he would probably have described as of Arabian Mights extravagance were to be spent in putting his nightmare on celluloid. Filmland’s interest has flagged in recent years, but good and evil are still marketable commodities. There will be a revival.

Manv who did established minor reputations, devoid of sensationalism or cause for ridicule. For Richard Garnett it provided a means of expressing a lighter and less conventional side of his personality. In public life he bore the shelf-long titles of Superintendent of the Reading Room and Keeper of the Printed Books at the British Museum Library. Paper-making was the business of the Garnett family, who had been long established in the Yorkshire town of Otlev, a handful of miles from the Bronte’s Haworth. Richard quickly graduated to the other end of the trade, where people were paid for making little black marks upon the stuff. The majority of his seventy-one years were spent behind the scenes in one of the world’s greatest accumulations of the printed word. If he is watching events at the Library from some bookish Elysium, the spectacle of its struggles to prepare for the Third Millennium must be a melancholy one. Even a partial acquaintance with Victorian fiction will show that the public were expected to have some familiarity with the Ancient World, its history, theology and literature. In this respect Garnett went far beyond a mere grounding in the classics; his erudition was regarded as formidable by his contemporaries. Thus Twilight, though light in tone, carries a considerable freight of references and allusions likely to be partly or wholly lost upon modern readers. While this may rob the language of its full richness, it should not impair enjoyment of his wry, cynical humour. Love, hypocrisy and men­ dacity are human constants, whatever the Age. The number of stories in the collection varies considerably from edition to edition. There were sixteen in the 1888 original and more were added in 1903. An illustrated hardcover (1924), with an introduction by T. E. Lawrence, no less, had twenty-eight, as had an American edition of 1926. Later paperback reprints reverted to the original sixteen. Lawrence was only one of a roster of Garnett enthusiasts which included Flecker, H. G. Wells and Swinburne. Anyone who has shared a long hut with a couple of dozen other adolescent National Servicemen may boggle at the thought of entertaining them with readings from Twilight, but Lawrence claimed that his squaddies loved it. Perhaps the alternative was The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Christianity gets a bad press in Garnett’s stories. Paganism has its failings too, but it is allowed to deliver the goods now and again. Among those dealing with the Church and the Devil, ‘The Demon Pope’ is almost a con­ densed novel and is reminiscent of the images used by Fellini and Buñuel. 41\n\n‘Madam Lucifer’ begins: ‘Lucifer sat playing chess with Man for his soul. The game was evidently going ill for Man. He had but pawns left, few and strug­ gling. Lucifer had rooks, knights, and, of course, bishops . . .’ In the title story, Prometheus is freed from his chains and mistaken by a band of Christians for a miraculously preserved martyr. Finding it a hazar­ dous office, he retires with his Greek lady to run a homely wayside house for disenthroned Gods. There is humour in the author’s footnotes, as with ‘The Elixir of Life’, to which he adds that the magazine in which it appeared expired immediately afterwards. To show that Homer could nod, he con­ fesses that ‘The Poison Maid’ may have been an unconscious plagiarism of Hawthorne’s ‘Rapaccini’s Daughter’. An occupational hazard for a widely read writer. Garnett’s urbanely subversive style belongs to a well-established tradition. Examples of it persisted into the next century in the pages of Punch, the stories of Saki and the work of Americans such as Clark Ashton Smith. There are dialogues in Twilight which would not sound out of place in the historical fantasies of Sprague de Camp. Garnett’s children carried on the tradition of service to literature, which had begun with his own father, who preceded him at the British Museum. His son Edward was a novelist and publisher’s reader whose wife, Constance, did the first English translations of Tolstoy, Chekhov and Dostoevsky. Their son, David, is remembered for two highly individual fantasies, Lady into Fox and A Man in the Zoo. It may be, as de Camp speculated in Amra, that the unfashionable erudition discernible behind the wit and playful wickedness of the stories causes pub­ lishers to shy away. If they feel that the market no longer has a place for it, that is the public’s loss. To anyone out there who is willing to take a chance, please make it the full twenty-eight, with or without illustrations.\n\nFirst edition London: T.

If the description suggests a dilettante, it is 100 miles from the reality. The Arts and Crafts Movement, of which Morris became the leading figure, was formed by artists and craftsmen dissatisfied with the policies of the Royal Academy. Their own policy was to create artifacts which combined beauty and usefulness. For Morris, this was part of a philosophy which, in an ideal world, would embrace the whole of human society. In pursuit of that ideal he learned many crafts, and learned them well. The heedless, turbulent, fecund human race, enthralled by steam, enchanted by electricity, preferred o"
