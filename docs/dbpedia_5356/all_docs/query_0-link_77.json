        "text": "It is September 1950, and General MacArthur — known throughout war-struck Korea as “General Megado” — has just landed his troops at\n\nInchon. The soldiers establish an encampment named Texas Town, receiving local women who, as a consequence, are publicly shunned as “Yankee wives”. The devastating impact of MacArthur’s assault is seen through the eyes of local teenager Mansik, whose mother joins the prostitutes after being raped. By diverting his attention away from military battle, Junghyo re-establishes the human cost of war: in this context, the real price is demonstrated by Mansik’s accelerated adolescence and the compromised sexuality of the so-called “UN ladies”.\n\nCharlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nRichard Aldington: Death of a Hero (1929)\n\nThis deeply aﬀecting tale depicts the short life of artist- turned-army soldier George Winterbourne, who (as we are told in the opening pages) is killed after deliberately exposing himself to machine ﬁ re. We soon learn that it is George’s experiences of war, triggering a deep psychological decline, which draw him towards his fate. Death of a Hero perhaps lacks the relentless ferocity of its peers — details of actual physical combat account for less than half of the narrative. The real intensity of Aldington’s (partly autobiographical) novel instead lies in his savage condemnation of a society responsible for the slaughter of its own men.\n\nCharlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nBeryl Bainbridge: Master Georgie (199\n\nTwo photographers are among an unlikely group of Liverpudlians who embark for Constantinople and become involved in the carnage of the\n\nCrimean war. Master Georgie, the conﬂ icted hub around which the others revolve, is seen from diﬀ erent points of view in a series of snapshots. But whereas the photographs distort the truth, Bainbridge’s diamond- bright insights reveal the horror and humour of people’s struggle to remain in control of lives ruled by random events and accident with the vivid economy of a writer at the top of her form.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nNigel Balchin: Darkness Falls from the Air (1942)\n\nA love triangle played out against the London blitz, Darkness Falls From The Air is the tale of Bill Sarratt, an urbane civil servant whose work is hampered by needless bureaucracy. His marriage is equally wearing, with his wife Marcia openly involved in a long- running aﬀair with dreamy writer Stephen. Infused with a deliciously dry wit, Balchin’s novel is a perfect portrayal of the stiﬀ upper lip — with Bill appearing just as unperturbed by his wife’s inﬁdelity as he is by falling bombs. Balchin’s experiences at the ministry of food, meanwhile, feed into his slyly satirical portrait of a complex and ineﬀ ectual civil service.\n\nCharlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJG Ballard: Empire of the Sun (1984)\n\nBallard’s 1984 account of his childhood in occupied Shanghai is not reportage — the author juggled incidents, removed events and largely shunted his parents from view — yet remains an evocative and disturbing account of life in wartime. Young Jim survives in empty houses, ingeniously obtaining the materials of survival, and is interned by the Japanese. It’s full of potent moral ironies, in which atrocities sit alongside mundane events and Jim admires the very technology that has wreaked havoc upon his world.\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nPat Barker: Regeneration (1991)\n\nInspired by her grandfather’s experiences in the ﬁrst world war trenches, Barker’s trilogy of novels — which also includes The Eye in the Door (1993) and The Ghost Road (1995) — centres around the Edinburgh psychiatric hospital where soldiers were “cured” of psychological trauma before being sent back to the front. Rivers is the heroic therapist handling ﬁrst public objector Siegfried Sassoon, then Wilfred Owen and the ﬁctional Billy Prior, before sending them back to the devastation of the ﬁnal few months of the war. There are horrifying descriptions of trench warfare, but it is Barker’s forensic examination of the psyche of these men that makes her novel both contemporary and timeless.\n\nNicola Barr\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nSebastian Barry: A Long Long Way (2005)\n\nThe familiar horrors of the ﬁrst world war are seen from the fresh perspective of a young Irish volunteer in this passionate and lyrical novel, one of two by Barry to have been shortlisted for the Man Booker prize. Too small to be a policeman like his evered father, Willie Dunne is proud to enlist in the British army. But on leave in 1916 he helps put down the Easter Rising, only to discover that some of his fellow countrymen regard the “ﬁlthy Hun” as “our allies in Europe”. The appalling complexity of war for soldiers who have been rejected by their homeland and can no longer identify the enemy is gripping and inevitably tragic.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nHE Bates: Fair Stood the Wind for France (1944)\n\n“Sometimes the Alps lying below in the moonlight had the appearance of crisp folds of crumpled cloth.” What could be more English than crumpled linen? Or HE Bates. And this novel is classically English in many ways. The brave, sensitive RAF bomber pilot John Franklin, for instance, is all restrained emotion even when his plane is shot down in France. Yet he falls so heartbreakingly completely for Francoise, the daughter of the mill owner who hides him in his home. Bates’s war novel concentrates on the continuance of love, and the possibility of renewal, his hero and heroine exhibiting levels of trust and commitment undimmed by their experiences.\n\nNicola Barr\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nNina Bawden: Carrie’s War (1973)\n\nTwelve-year-old Carrie Willow and her younger brother Nick are sent to Wales to escape the dangers of wartime London. Housed with the grim Mr Evans and his timid sister Lou, they encounter warfare of a diﬀerent\n\nkind and seek refuge with the enchanting inhabitants of the farm at Druid’s Bottom. Carrie’s eﬀ orts to help the people she has come to love lead her to commit what she believes to be a terrible crime. Though written primarily for children, this is an almost perfect novel, to be enjoyed at any age.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nRoberto Bolaño: The Savage Detectives (199\n\nCentral characters Arturo Belano and Ulises Lima are likened to “two Dennis Hoppers walking the streets of Mexico City”, but they are neither savage nor good detectives. They are part of a literary movement called “visceral realism” though, a minor movement engaged in gang warfare with another group, the “Stridentist”. At its heart, Bolaño’s novel is a kind of road novel: made up of interviews with Belano and Lima’s acquaintances, it sketches a scorching, epic portrait of the Americas. An novel as brilliant in its execution as it is bonkers in its conception.\n\nPhilip Oltermann\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nPaul Bowles: The Sheltering Sky (1949)\n\nA signiﬁ cant forerunner of the Beat movement, Paul Bowles’ bestseller is the story of three jaded American travellers — Port Moresby, his wife Kit and their friend Tunner — drifting through postwar north Africa. Having rejected the comforts of civilisation in their search for identity and fulﬁ lment, the trio are soon under threat from the sense of alienation and hostility that surrounds them. Inspired by Bowles’ own period of exile in Morocco, this account of a diﬃcult emotional journey made a huge impact on publication, having astutely tapped into a growing state of disaﬀection across America. Charlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nWilliam Boyd: An Ice-Cream War (1982)\n\nIn the early stages of the ﬁrst world war, newlywed Gabriel Cobb ﬁnds himself caught up in the ﬁ ght for control over eastern Africa. Meanwhile, in England, Gabriel’s brother Felix and wife Charis are left alone together as a mutual attraction grows between them. Their aﬀ air is cut short when they discover that Gabriel has been captured, prompting Felix to travel across an increasingly war-torn African landscape to ﬁ nd him. Interspersing vivid action scenes with moments of tranquillity in Kent, Boyd’s novel is a stirring portrayal of decaying British imperialism and the ordinary lives that become shaped by conﬂict.\n\nCharlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nRaymond Briggs: When the Wind Blows (1982)\n\nThis depiction of an elderly rural couple attempting to shield themselves from a nuclear blast by putting blind trust in government guidelines (cover windows with sheets and climb into paper bags) caused a sensation when it was published in 1982. Blacker-than-black comedy ensues as James and Hilda unwittingly succumb to radiation sickness, unable even to eat their reserved ginger nuts because their gums are bleeding uncontrollably. Surprisingly, it’s still classiﬁed as a children’s picture book in many a local library.\n\nChris Ross\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nItalo Calvino: Invisible Cities (1974)\n\nGore Vidal called Calvino’s seventh novel — “or work or meditation or poem” — his most beautiful. Marco Polo describes his travels to Kublai Khan, presenting the world-weary emperor with fractal glimpses of 55 fantastic cities — the unﬁnished, the unforgettable, the dreamlike, the destroyed — that are all ultimately versions of his “ﬁrst city”, Venice. This glittering jewel of a book has been an inspiration to travellers, architects and authors alike, its pages brimming with meaning and possibility.\n\nJustine Jordan\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nElias Canetti: Auto-da-Fé (1935)\n\nPeter Kien is an eminent sinologist in interwar Germany, comfortably insulated from humanity and any “touch of the unknown” by his library. Until, that is, he falls victim to his illiterate housekeeper and a proto-Nazi concierge, and begins a grotesque descent into madness and the urban underworld, guided by an evil dwarf. This is a blackly comic study of vulnerability, fascism and self-destruction by the polymathic author of Crowds and Power, and a serious novel of ideas in the grand Central European manner.\n\nChris Ross\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nWilla Cather: One Of Ours (1922)\n\nWhen it was published, Cather’s account of a Nebraskan farmer’s journey to the ﬁrst world war and his sacriﬁcial death in battle garnered high praise and vitriolic criticism in equal measure. The Pulitzer prize the following year was oﬀ set by condemnation from Hemingway, among others, for daring to tackle the “masculine” subject of war. But her novel is as much an epitaph for the passing of the pioneering experience and the inﬁnite opportunities of Western expansion, and far more ambiguous and wide-ranging than her critics allowed.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nLouis-Ferdinand Céline: Journey to the End of the Night (1932)\n\nThis dark but humorous novel follows a young man, loosely based on the author, through the ﬁrst world war and into the poorest suburbs of postwar Paris. With its use of natural speech patterns and unﬂ inching descriptions of misery and wickedness, it was hugely popular in the 1930s, and continued to be inﬂ uential — Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller and the Doors are among the many who have referred to it in their work — even though Céline was subsequently branded a Nazi sympathiser.\n\nDavid Newnham\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nWu Cheng’en: Monkey (1590s)\n\nIn this Chinese classic, the monk Tripitaka travels to India to fetch sacred Buddhist texts, accompanied by three disciples: the greedy Pigsy, the river monster Sandy and Monkey (recruited so that they may atone for past sins), on the way doing battle with demons, monsters and evil magicians. This boisterous comic adventure tale is both an allegory for the individual’s journey towards enlightenment and a social and political satire. The quest may have been given to the blundering monk, but the real star of the story is its antihero, the irrepressible trickster, rule-breaker and troublemaker Monkey. The novel was the inspiration behind a cult Japanese 1970s television show, and its latest incarnation is Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn’s “pop opera” Monkey: Journey to the West.\n\nGinny Hooker\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJoseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness (1902)\n\nThe most explosive, and recently controversial, indictment of European\n\ncolonialism in British ﬁction. Conrad’s series hero, Charles Marlow, is discovered spinning a yarn to a group of friends on board his yacht, in the mouth of the Thames. Marlow ruminates about his early assignment, from the “Company” in Brussels, to steam upstream to the heart of the Belgian Congo, where the manager of the inner station, who is in charge of ivory harvesting, has apparently gone mad. Despite obstacles (and witnessing scenes of hideous colonial cruelty), Marlow completes his mission, and ﬁnds Kurtz — originally a fervent idealist — has reverted to savagery. He dies, with the words: “The horror! The horror!” Marlow himself has seen into the heart of darkness, and is a changed man thereafter.\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJoseph Conrad: Lord Jim (1900)\n\nLord Jim takes the familiar narrative of the seafaring hero and turns it inside out, as only Conrad can. His Jim is a young idealist who is promoted in the merchant navy without ever really having had his mettle tested. When the moment comes, Jim makes the coward’s choice — an act that determines the rest of his life, down to his idolisation by a Malaysian tribe. But is he really in the wrong? Conrad uses every trick he knows to express the doubts and fears of a time when ideas of conventional morality seemed to be crumbling underfoot.\n\nCarrie O’Grady\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJoseph Conrad: Nostromo (1904)\n\nSettlers, natives and interlopers all battle for control of a silver mine in the ﬁctional South American country of Costaguana. Many of Conrad’s familiar obsessions are here: revolutionary politics, the curdling of ambition into avarice, oppressive heat, confusion and corruptibility. But where Heart of Darkness draws us into a deeply subjective interior, the language of Nostromo is radically exteriorised — alienating, even. An essential modernist experiment, as rigorous and unsparing in its imagination as the glare of the midday sun that falls upon its cynical protagonists.\n\nChris Ross\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nBernard Cornwell: Sharpe’s Eagle (1981)\n\nAccording to legend, Cornwell only started writing his ﬁrst book about his\n\nlantern-jawed, Napoleonic-era riﬂeman because green card regulations\n\nprevented him earning a conventional living when he relocated to America. It’s a story guaranteed to infuriate unpublished writers suﬀering for their art. What makes the series so pleasurable: is Cornwell’s enthusiasm for his historical subject and delight in his rough-hewn hero’s escapades. His prose may be workmanlike, but his relish for the books is infectious. In short, Sharpe is fun.\n\nSam Jordison\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nFrancis Coventry: The History of Pompey the Little (1751)\n\nCoventry’s satirical novel follows the adventures of a small canine across numerous diﬀerent owners’ laps to the top of English society. He may have no religion, but Pompey, “always willing to fetch and carry”, has “courtly manners” and proves an object of adoration until he suﬀers “a violent physick” and barks his last. To describe this satire as unique barely does justice to its eccentric charm, but only recently has Coventry been recognised as a talent independent of his hero Henry Fielding. A shame, since this book deserves a wide readership.\n\nSam Jordison\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nStephen Crane: The Red Badge of Courage (1895)\n\nWhen Crane started reading Civil war veterans’ reminiscences, he complained: “They spout enough of what they did, but they’re as emotionless as rocks.” So he created someone altogether more feelingful. His own Union army private Henry Fielding may start ardent for glory, but his ﬁrst experiences of the horror and cruelty of battle forces him to plumb the depths of fear.

The only survivor, our entirely resourceful hero, survives for 26 years by learning how to make everything from scratch, from pots to Christian theology (he does have a bible). He also defeats encroaching cannibals and pirates.

The dramatic events are seen from multiple vantage points, adopting perspectives from both sides of the conﬂict.\n\nThe level of detail employed in this frequently underrated novel is what makes it truly shocking: its tone of cool, clinical analysis is always the same, whether applied to death and destruction or machinery and weather conditions. An acclaimed BBC radio dramatisation, starring Tom Baker, capitalised on the novel’s potent docu-drama feel by using a highly eﬀective real-time framework, drawing out in full the terrifying intensity of Deighton’s writing.\n\nCharlotte Stretch\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJames Dickey: Deliverance (1970)\n\nFour friends set out on a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee, a soon-to-be-dammed river in northern Georgia. While there, the men encounter two savage locals who quickly transform the weekend adventure into a traumatic ordeal — one that not everyone survives. Though frequently overshadowed by the success of John Boorman’s 1972 ﬁlm adaptation, Dickey’s novel possesses its own strain of intoxicatingly visceral poetry. This compelling story of two cultures, brought together in a state of violent conﬂict, serves as a gripping examination of lost innocence and moral uncertainty in the quiet backwoods of America.\n\nJohn Dugdale\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJohn Dos Passos: Three Soldiers (1921)\n\nDos Passos worked as an ambulance driver during the ﬁrst world war, and this shows in a book which cleverly contains very little combat but all the boredom and brutality of the sidelines. The bewildering idiocies of boot camp, the interminable waiting around with no idea why, the aﬀectless encounters with prostitutes — all combine to grind three Americans of diverse backgrounds into just so much “meat for guns”. Characteristically episodic and disorienting, this is a gem of an antiwar novel by an unjustly overlooked writer.\n\nChris Ross\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nNorman Douglas: South Wind (1917)\n\nIn 1916 Douglas was arrested when a boy made a complaint to the police for (as Douglas said) “kissing [him] and iving him some cakes and a shilling”. He jumped bail, ﬂeeing to Capri, whose salubrious atmosphere inspired this captivating song of praise to the beauties of the Mediterranean and the pleasures of hedonism. Often criticised for having no plot, South Wind is a mystifying, but still enlightening, conversational novel, full of entrancing discussions of love, pleasures and scandals that together form a touching plea for tolerance and fantastic evocation of bohemian life.\n\nSam Jordison\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAlexandre Dumas: The Three Musketeers (1844)\n\nThe story of the dashing d’Artagnan, the swashbuckling musketeers Athos, Porthos and Aramis and their epic struggles against the feline M’Lady is one of the best-loved in western culture. It may be the subject of more than a dozen ﬁlms, not to mention endless TV serials, cartoons and spin-oﬀ books, but Dumas’s book is still the best place to go to really get to know the characters.

The eponymous heroine is “a child of the city, which decrees that its women shall be the voluptuaries not of pleasure but of pain, doomed to hunt for what they least dare to ﬁnd!” Alexandria, “the great winepress of love”, is evoked in prose of intoxicating lyricism, but for many readers these books are a vintage best appreciated in youth.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nWilliam Eastlake: The Bamboo Bed (1969)\n\nCaptain Clancy is leading his men across the Vietnam hills when he is mortally wounded.

Meanwhile two hippies, Peter and Bethany, are attempting to resolve the conﬂict with ﬂowers and a guitar.

The town of Krishnapur is under siege and the garrison is hard put to survive and, just as importantly to some of them, to cling to their Victorian values. They believe in science but their two doctors disagree about almost everything; they believe in their civilization but their subjects are rebelling. The local Indian populace picnic on a nearby hill and enjoy the spectacle of the unfolding drama. Violence is coolly recorded, derring-do excitingly narrated, yet this is a darkly funny book, whose unsentimental, omniscient narrator scrutinises the self-delusions of the colonialists.\n\nJohn Mullan\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nSebastian Faulks: Birdsong (1993)\n\nNovels depicting the horrors of war are seldom more moving than Sebastian Faulks’ 1993 bestseller.

Christopher Tietjens, the central character, is passionately attached to a gentlemanly code that brings him nothing but trouble in Whitehall, the army and his marriage to the icy Sylvia. Ford’s kaleidoscopic descriptions of trench warfare are the book’s main claim on posterity, but the whole thing is shot through with an attractively eccentric sense of humour as well as nostalgia.

The African Queen sinks before they can make their suicidal strike. They are taken prisoner by the Germans, who treat them well. The enemy ship is eventually sunk by the Royal Navy.

On being expelled (for drunkenness and worse) from Dr Arnold’s Rugby, Harry Flashman joins the army to ﬁ ght, as an oﬃcer and anything but a gentleman, in the ﬁ rst Afghan war. It is the proverbial military cock-up. The series, allegedly based on the anti-hero’s “papers”, continued, volume by bestselling volume, to cast a cynical but hilariously comic anti-establishment light on “England’s century”. Ironically, Harry emerges as, underneath it all, rather a good fellow.

The story of Richard, roaming Asia in search of a secret Thai island, inspired an entire generation of backpackers.

Set in 1943, it follows a group of Jewish partisans making their way, behind enemy lines, across a Europe unmarked by place names and directions, with Palestine their aim. The horrors they have endured are revealed only through dreams and halting recollections and, as in all Levi’s work, their days are characterised by the biggest threat of all: the disease of despair. “The war would last forever: death, pursuit, escape would never end, the snow would never stop falling, day would never break.”\n\nNicola Barr\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nJack London: The Call of the Wild (1903)\n\nSt Bernard Buck leads a good, even pampered life when he is abducted, sold into a team of dogs pulling sleds across the frozen Alaskan landscapes, transporting a new “yellow metal” that is changing men’s natures. “It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law, and Buck met it halfway.” Only the most extreme of traits — human or otherwise — are on show in London’s classic, relentless adventure story. Good, evil, respect, dignity, primal fear, blood lust, leadership, greatness and cowardice are all in constant battle as Buck struggles for survival against his new owners and the “devil dog” Spitz.

Jimmy loses the horse and pistol in a storm; John and Lacey decide to help get them back, setting oﬀ a fatal chain of events which also have consequences for Cole’s love aﬀ air with the daughter of a Mexican ranch owner.

Using the true-life Glanton gang as its touchstone, McCarthy drops an unnamed protagonist (”the kid”) in among a band of bounty hunters and proceeds to paint the frontier in stark, Darwinian terms — as a brutal, bloody free-for-all. The New World is born out of violence.

The exotic Tonkinese ladies and wistful Bali Hai romances give it lasting (and musical) appeal, but the morality of Michener’s tales is that heroism is not only seen on the battleﬁeld, and his commander-narrator’s voice has a downbeat languor that captures the spirit of a war- weary nation (”The waiting.

Whether you love the extrovert, impulsive, permanently hungover “lion in action, ass ashore” Jack Aubrey or the surgeon and intelligence agent Stephen Maturin, indeed whether you have ever set foot aboard a ship, O’Brian’s tales of naval derring-do are masterful in conception and execution.\n\nNicola Barr\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nTim O’Brien: The Things they Carried (1990)\n\n“They carried the common secret of cowardice … Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to.” That Tim O’Brien, as a soldier in Vietnam, experienced ﬁrst- hand many of the things he writes about is not in doubt when the observations are this acute, but Things is ﬁction, and this 1990 novel is regarded as one of the most powerful of the Vietnam war.

The soldiers reserve their hatred not for the enemy but the armchair warriors on the home front. On the day that Armistice is signed, Paul, realising that he can never readjust to civilian life, walks into no-man’s-land and is shot.

The main strand of narrative (never Scott’s strongest point) follows the career of Wilfrid of Ivanhoe, a disinherited knight, who must choose in love between the Saxon beauty Rowena, and the beautiful Jewess Rebecca. Scott’s novel popularised the legendary Robin Hood, the medieval joust (the plot hinges on a great tournament) and idealised medievalism.

Its dispassionate eye follows peasants, emperors, soldiers, and priests through decades, taking in life and death in all its forms. This is no heroic tale of good versus evil, of strategies and battle formations, but a vivid depiction of the banality, tedium and senselessness of war. In its time, it was so formally innovative that even Tolstoy himself didn’t consider it to be a novel in the conventional sense. He was so dissatisfied with the first version that he rewrote it and never felt he’d got it right. Its everyman hero, Pierre (played unforgettably on TV by Anthony Hopkins), blunders along, struggling to find meaning in his life, and each of the dozen or so central characters battle their own demons, searching for truth and peace.

Vonnegut, like his ingénue hero, Billy Pilgrim, was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and imprisoned in Dresden, shortly before the ﬁrebombing in February 1945 which killed (as Vonnegut recalls) over 100,000 German civilians. The narrative opens with Billy “unstuck” in time. He is, perhaps, mad. Or, as he believes, he has been given the power of clairvoyance and time travel by extraterrestrial Tralfamadorians, whose prisoner he is. The Tralfamadorians have destroyed the universe by their bombing error but can enjoy the good moments of their previous existences. The narrative recoils\n\nfrom graphic description of wartime atrocity to fanciful space opera. As Konnegut records, it was an immensely painful novel to write and, for all its incidental comedy and literary skill, remains painful to read. But necessary, none the less.\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nEvelyn Waugh: Put Out More Flags (1942)\n\nBasil Seal, posh and feckless, has been a leader writer on the Daily Beast, a champagne salesman, a tour guide, a secret policeman in Bolivia, and an adviser on modernisation to the emperor of Azania – all way relationship between a young southern writer, a Polish Auschwitz survivor and a Jewish New Yorker interweaves a host of complex themes (survivor guilt, ancestral guilt, madness and betrayal). The movie was Oscar-nominated; the book was banned in libraries across the States. But this is not just about provocative comparisons. Styron is a writer’s writer, capable of setting a pastoral idyll in Brooklyn, and the traumas narrated occur alongside a classic American coming-of-age story.\n\nChris Ross\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nEvelyn Waugh: Men at Arms (1952)\n\nThe ﬁ rst of the Sword of Honour trilogy, which was followed by Oﬃcers and Gentlemen in 1955 and Unconditional Surrenderin 1961. Guy Crouchback is the last of an ancient English Catholic family — miserable, childless, divorced and forbidden by his religion to remarry. At 35, the outbreak of war seems to give meaning to his life: he is commissioned into the Royal Corps of Halberdiers, an outﬁt somewhere between a prep school and a gentleman’s club. In Waugh’s mordent satire on the wartime army, bungling is standard, idiots are greeted as heroes and fools are unfailingly promoted. “Unquestionably,” wrote Cyril Connolly, “the ﬁnest novels to have come out of the war.”\n\nCharlotte Higgins\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nHG Wells: The Island of Dr Moreau (1896)\n\nThe most morbid of Wells’s remarkable 1890s “scientiﬁc romances” and a classic fable of vivisection — a cause célèbre of the late Victorian period. The hero narrator, Prendick, is shipwrecked and ﬁnds himself on a Paciﬁc island, where he discovers that Dr Moreau (earlier hounded out of England for torturing animals) has perfected surgical techniques by which he can accelerate evolution. Under his Darwinian scalpel, animals are raised to quasi-humanity. But once raised, these “monsters” need to be kept in check by the sadistic inﬂiction of pain. Moreau is killed by a puma he is tormenting and rebellion breaks out. The animals revert to their natural animalism. Moreau’s last words are: “What a mess.” The novel revolted contemporary reviewers but hasfascinated posterity.\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nRobert Westall: The Machine-Gunners (1975)\n\nChas McGill’s collection of war souvenirs becomes more than a schoolboy pastime when he ﬁnds a crashed German bomber with its machine-gun still attached. After their school takes a hit during an air-raid, McGill and his friends make use of the free time to wage their own war against the enemy. The Machine Gunners, which was adapted into a BBC television serial in 1983, brilliantly evokes Tyneside in the second world war and the disruption to ordinary family life, while capturing the complicated relationships that exist between children and adults. It won the Carnegie medal in 1975, and in 2007 was selected by medal judges as one of the 10 most important children’s novels of the past 70 years.\n\nJames Smart\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nPatrick White: Voss (1957)\n\nVoss, a German explorer, sets out in 1845 to cross the uncharted Australian desert. Before leaving, he meets Laura Trevelyan, a young Englishwoman newly arrived in the colony, and they fall in love. The novel then intertwines Laura’s life in Sydney with the increasingly desperate travails of Voss’s doomed expedition. Though the couple never meet again, they appear to communicate through a series of heightened, dream-like visions that become more intense as Voss’s mind, beset by the sin of intellectual pride, fractures under the weight of the physical challenge he has undertaken. In 1985 White’s novel was adapted into an opera by Richard Meale, with a libretto by David Malouf.\n\nAdam Newey\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nOwen Wister: The Virginian (1902)\n\nNot many writers get to invent a genre, but that’s what Wister did in 1902 with The Virginian, the Western novel that spawned a thousand books and even more ﬁlms. All the future cliches are here, but new-minted: the tall handsome stranger who learns how to be a man among the wide open spaces of the unspoiled West, magniﬁ cent landscapes, violent villains — who get their comeuppance — and a lovely schoolmarm endeavouring to instil civilised values in an uncouth bunch of frontiersmen. This book has all the freshness of a literary pioneer.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nHerman Wouk: The Caine Mutiny (1951)\n\nSoon after Willie Keith joins the US Navy in 1943, his dying father describes him as “much like our whole country – young, naive, spoiled and softened by abundance and good luck, but with an interior hardness that comes from your sound stock”. On board the Caine, an ageing minesweeper in the Paciﬁc, Willie grows up fast, but it is his involvement in mutiny and its aftermath that ﬁnally turns him into the man his father never was. Wouk won a Pulitzer prize for this dramatic account of the realities of warfare in the Paciﬁc.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nÉmile Zola: The Debacle (1892)\n\nThe penultimate book in Zola’s monumental sequence about a French family during the Second Empire, The Debacle chronicles the disastrous war between France and Prussia in 1870 and the Paris Commune of the following year, through the moving friendship between two men. Jean Macquart, earthy and pragmatic, wins the respect of the intellectual and mercurial Maurice Levasseur. Initially comrades, they ﬁght on opposite sides in 1871, with tragic consequences. Written only 20 years after the events it describes, Zola’s novel is a moving indictment of the waste and cruelty of war.\n\nJoanna Hines\n\nOriginating as a BBC radio series in 1978, Douglas Adams’s inspired melding of hippy-trail guidebook and sci-fi comedy turned its novelisations into a publishing phenomenon. Douglas wrote five parts from 1979 onwards (the first sold 250,000 in three months), introducing the world to Marvin the Paranoid Android, the computer Deep Thought, space guitarist Hotblack Desiato (named after Adams’s local estate agent) and the Guide itself, a remarkably prescient forerunner to the internet.\n\nAndrew Pulver\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nBrian W Aldiss: Non-Stop (195\n\nAldiss’s first novel is a tour-de-force of adventure, wonder and conceptual breakthrough. Set aboard a vast generation starship millennia after blast-off, the novel follows Roy Complain on a voyage of discovery from ignorance of his surroundings to some understanding of his small place in the universe. Complain is spiteful and small-minded but grows in humanity as his trek through the ship brings him into contact with giant humans, mutated rats and, ultimately, a wondrous view of space beyond the ship.\n\nEric Brown\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nIsaac Asimov: Foundation (1951)\n\nOne of the first attempts to write a comprehensive “future history”, the trilogy – which also includes Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953) – is Asimov’s version of Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, set on a galactic scale. Hari Seldon invents the science of psychohistory with which to combat the fall into barbarianism of the Human Empire, and sets up the Foundation to foster art, science and technology. Wish-fulfilment of the highest order, the novels are a landmark in the history of science fiction.\n\nEB\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nMargaret Atwood: The Blind Assassin (2000)\n\nOn planet Zycron, tyrannical Snilfards subjugate poor Ygnirods, providing intercoital entertainment for a radical socialist and his lover. We assume she is Laura Chase, daughter of an Ontario industrialist, who records their sex and sci-fi stories in a novel, The Blind Assassin. Published posthumously by Laura’s sister, Iris, the book outrages postwar sensibilities. Iris is 83 in the cantankerous present-day narrative, and ready to set the story straight about the suspicious deaths of her sister, husband and daughter. In this Booker prize-winning novel about novels, Atwood bends genre and traps time, toying brilliantly with the roles of writing and reading.\n\nNatalie Cate\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nPaul Auster: In the Country of Last Things (1987)\n\nAnna Blume, 19, arrives in a city to look for her brother. She finds a ruin, where buildings collapse on scavenging citizens. All production has stopped. Nobody can leave, except as a corpse collected for fuel. Suicide clubs flourish. Anna buys a trolley and wanders the city, salvaging objects and information. She records horrific scenes, but also a deep capacity for love. This small hope flickers in a world where no apocalyptic event is specified. Instead, Auster creates his dystopia by magnifying familiar flaws and recycling historical detail: the novel’s working title was “Anna Blume Walks Through the 20th Century”.\n\nNC\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nIain Banks: The Wasp Factory (1984)\n\nA modern-gothic tale of mutilation, murder and medical experimentation, Banks’s first novel – described by the Irish Times as “a work of unparalleled depravity”- is set on a Scottish island inhabited by the ultimate dysfunctional family: a mad scientist and his unbalanced sons, older brother Eric, who has been locked up for everyone’s safety, and Frank, the 16-year-old narrator, tormented by a freak accident that cost him his genitals. Frank’s victims are mostly animals – but he has found time to kill a few children …\n\nPhil Daoust\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nIain M Banks: Consider Phlebas (1987)\n\nSpace opera is unfashionable, but Banks couldn’t care less. “You get the opportunity to work on a proper canvas,” he says. “Big, big brushes, broad strokes.” The strokes have rarely been broader than in Banks’s Culture novels, about a galaxy-spanning society in which humans and artificial intelligences are united by a love of parties, adventure and a damn good fight. Consider Phlebas introduced the first of many misguided or untrustworthy heroes – Horza, who can change his body just by thinking about it – and a typically Banksian collision involving two giant trains in an subterranean station.\n\nPD\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nClive Barker: Weaveworld (1987)\n\nLife’s rich tapestry is just that in Clive Barker’s fantasy. A magic carpet is the last refuge of a people known as the Seerkind, who for centuries have been hunted by both humans and the Scourge, a mysterious being that seems determined to live up to its name. When it all starts to unravel, the carpet people’s best hope is a pigeon-fancying insurance clerk and his half-Seerkind companion. Yes, it sounds twee, but as Barker himself said, “the Seerkind fornicate, fart – they’re very far from pure”.\n\nPD\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nNicola Barker: Darkmans (2007)\n\nNicola Barker has been accused of obscurity, but this Booker-shortlisted comic epic has a new lightness of touch and an almost soapy compulsiveness. Set in Ashford, Kent, the kind of everytown that has turned its back on history, the novel dips into the lives of a loosely connected cast of everyday eccentrics who find that history – in the persona of Edward IV’s jester – is fighting back. A jumble of voices and typefaces, mortal fear and sarky laughter, the novel is as true as it is truly odd, and beautifully written to boot.\n\nJustine Jordan\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nStephen Baxter: The Time Ships (1995)\n\nIn his visionary sequel to Wells’s The Time Machine, Baxter continues the adventures of the Time-Traveller. He sends him back to the far future in an attempt to save the Eloi woman Weena, only to find himself in a future timeline diverging from the one he left. Baxter’s extraordinary continuation and expansion tackles the usual concerns of the time-travel story – paradox and causality – and goes on to explore many of the themes that taxed Wells: destiny, morality and the perfectibility of the human race.\n\nEB\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nGreg Bear: Darwin’s Radio (1999)\n\nBear combines intelligence, humour and the wonder of scientific discovery in a techno-thriller about a threat to the future of humanity. A retro-viral plague sweeps the world, infecting women via their sexual partners and aborting their embryos. But the plague is more than it seems … What might in other hands have been a mere end-of-the-world runaround is transformed by Bear’s scientific knowledge into something marvellous, as reason overcomes paranoia and fear.\n\nEB\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAlfred Bester: The Stars My Destination (1956)\n\n“Gully Foyle is my name / And Terra is my nation. / Deep space is my dwelling place / And death’s my destination …” Marooned in space after an attack on his ship, then ignored by a passing luxury liner, an illiterate mechanic plots revenge on those who left him to die. Somehow surviving, he swiftly gets down to it. Bester’s novel updates The Count of Monte Cristo with telepathy, nuclear weapons and interplanetary travel. Those who stumble across it are inevitably surprised to find it was written half a century ago.\n\nPD\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nPoppy Z Brite: Lost Souls (1992)\n\nBrite’s first novel, a lush, decadent and refreshingly provocative take on vampirism told in rich, stylish prose, put her at the forefront of the 1990s horror scene. It’s the story of Nothing, an angst-filled teenager who runs away from his adoptive parents to seek out his favourite band. Along the way he joins up with a group of vampires, finds his true family and discovers what he really values, amid much blood, sex, drugs and drink.\n\nKeith Brooke\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAlgis Budrys: Rogue Moon (1960)\n\nAl Barker is a thrillseeking adventurer recruited to investigate an alien labyrinth on the moon. Everyone who enters the maze dies, so Barker’s doppelganger is transmitted there while he remains in telepathic contact. Barker is the first person to survive the trauma of witnessing their own death, returning again and again to explore. Rogue Moon works as both thriller and character study, a classic novel mapping out a new and sophisticated SF, just as Barker maps the alien maze.\n\nKB\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nMikhail Bulgakov: The Master and Margarita (1966)\n\nWhen the Devil comes to 1930s Moscow, his victims are pillars of the Soviet establishment: a famous editor has his head cut off; another bureaucrat is made invisible. This is just a curtain-raiser for the main event, however: a magnificent ball for the damned and the diabolical. For his hostess, his satanic majesty chooses Margarita, a courageous young Russian whose lover is in a psychiatric hospital, traumatised by the banning of his novel. No prizes for guessing whom Bulgakov identified with; although Stalin admired his early work, by the 1930s he was personally banning it. This magisterial satire was not published until more than 20 years after the writer’s death.\n\nPD\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton: The Coming Race (1871)\n\nIn this pioneering work of British science fiction, the hero is a bumptious American mining engineer who stumbles on a subterranean civilisation. The “Vril-ya” enjoy a utopian social organisation based on “vril”, a source of infinitely renewable electrical power (commerce promptly produced the beef essence drink, Bovril). Also present are ray guns, aerial travel and ESP. Ironically, the hero finds utopia too boring. He is rescued from death by the Princess Zee, who flies him to safety. The novel ends with the ominous prophecy that the superior race will invade the upper earth – “the Darwinian proposition”, as Bulwer-Lytton called it.\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAnthony Burgess: A Clockwork Orange (1960)\n\nOne of a flurry of novels written by Burgess when he was under the mistaken belief that he had only a short time to live. Set in a dystopian socialist welfare state of the future, the novel fantasises a world without religion. Alex is a “droog” – a juvenile delinquent who lives for sex, violence and subcult high fashion. The narrative takes the form of a memoir, in Alex’s distinctive gang-slang. The state “programmes” Alex into virtue; later deprogrammed, he discovers what good and evil really are. The novel, internationally popularised by Stanley Kubrick’s 1970 film into what Burgess called “Clockwork Marmalade”, is Burgess’s tribute to his cradle Catholicism and, as a writer, to James Joyce.\n\nJS\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAnthony Burgess: The End of the World News (1982)\n\nIn one of the first split-screen narratives, Burgess juxtaposes three key 20th-century themes: communism, psychoanalysis and the millennial fear of Armageddon. Trotsky’s 1917 visit to New York is presented as a Broadway musical; a mournful Freud looks back on his life as he prepares to flee the Nazis; and in the year 2000, as a rogue asteroid barrels towards the Earth, humanity argues over who will survive and what kind of society they will take to the stars.\n\nJJ\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs: A Princess of Mars (1912)\n\nJohn Carter, a Confederate veteran turned gold prospector, is hiding from Indians in an Arizona cave when he is mysteriously transported to Mars, known to the locals as Barsoom. There, surrounded by four-armed, green-skinned warriors, ferocious white apes, eight-legged horse-substitutes, 10-legged “dogs”, and so on, he falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, who might almost be human if she didn’t lay eggs. She is, naturally, both beautiful and extremely scantily clad … Burroughs’s first novel, published in serial form, is the purest pulp, and its lack of pretension is its greatest charm.\n\nPD\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nWilliam Burroughs: Naked Lunch (1959)\n\nDisjointed, hallucinatory cut-ups form a collage of, as Burroughs explained of the title, “a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork”. A junkie’s picaresque adventures in both the real world and the fantastical “Interzone”, this is satire using the most savage of distorting mirrors: society as an obscene phantasmagoria of addiction, violence, sex and death. Only Cronenberg could have filmed it (in 1991), and even he recreated Burroughs’s biography rather than his interior world.\n\nJJ\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nOctavia Butler: Kindred (1979)\n\nButler’s fourth novel throws African American Dana Franklin back in time to the early 1800s, where she is pitched into the reality of slavery and the individual struggle to survive its horrors. Butler single-handedly brought to the SF genre the concerns of gender politics, racial conflict and slavery. Several of her novels are groundbreaking, but none is more compelling or shocking than Kindred. A brilliant work on many levels, it ingeniously uses the device of time travel to explore the iniquity of slavery through Dana’s modern sensibilities.\n\nEB\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nSamuel Butler: Erewhon (1872)\n\nThe wittiest of Victorian dystopias by the period’s arch anti-Victorian.

Assisted by a native, Chowbok, he makes a perilous journey across a mountain range to Erewhon (say it backwards), an upside-down world in which crime is “cured” and illness “punished”, where universities are institutions of “Unreason” and technology is banned.

He ends up keeping his promise, witnessing the French revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath from the perspective of the Italian treetops. Drafted soon after Calvino’s break with communism over the invasion of Hungary, the novel can be read as a fable about intellectual commitments. At the same time, it’s a perfectly turned fantasy, densely imagined but lightly written in a style modelled on Voltaire and Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nChris Tayler\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nRamsey Campbell: The Influence (198\n\nCampbell has long been one of the masters of psychological horror, proving again and again that what’s in our heads is far scarier than any monster lurking in the shadows.

Alice, while reading in a meadow, sees a white rabbit rush by, feverishly consulting a watch. She follows him down a hole (Freudian analysis, as elsewhere in the story, is all too easy), where she grows and shrinks in size and encounters creatures mythological, extinct and invented.

More donnish in tone, this fantasy follows Alice into a mirror world in which everything is reversed. Her journey is based on chess moves, during the course of which she meets such figures as Humpty Dumpty and the riddling twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee. More challenging intellectually than the first instalment, it explores loneliness, language and the logic of dreams.\n\nJS\n\nBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop\n\nAngela Carter: Nights at the Circus (1984)\n\nThe year is 1899 – and other times.
