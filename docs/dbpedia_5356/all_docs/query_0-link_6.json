        "text": "The first dedicated look at the Golden Age publisher of UNCLE SAM, PHANTOM LADY, BLACK CONDOR, THE RAY, HUMAN BOMB, DOLL MAN, PLASTIC MAN, the BLACKHAWKS, and others now under the DC Comics umbrella. Includes A-Z character profiles of every Quality costumed hero, and full-color reprints of several 1940s key stories with art by LOU FINE, REED CRANDALL, JACK COLE, CHUCK CUIDERA, MATT BAKER, WILL EISNER, and others! There’s a chronology and oral history with commentary by major Quality creators, plus it covers the characters’ revivals from the 1960s to today that introduced the Quality characters into the DC Comics universe, and the Freedom Fighters’ own series. Written by Mike Kooiman with Jim Amash."
