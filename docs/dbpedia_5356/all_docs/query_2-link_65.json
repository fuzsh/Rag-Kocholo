        "text": "BECCON\n\nBECCON is a regional English convention which, during the 1980's, published a convention booklet with each convention. At least two of these were bibliographies of the Guest of Honour (a third, of Richard Cowper, was announced for 1985, but has not been seen and is believed not to exist). More recently they also published the outstanding bibliography of E.C. Tubb.\n\nWhile superficially very different, the basic coverage of the first two bibliographies is fundamentally the same. The Bayley bibliography \"attempts to cover all English language editions of all BJB's books and reprintings of his short fiction\", excluding his extensive contributions to the juvenile comic-book field. The Bulmer bibliography also concentrates on English-language fiction, excluding contributions to juvenile comic-books, but is less extensive in terms of reprints and, conversely, adds information on some other areas such as factual articles and fanzines.\n\nThe third volume is a very different matter being a very detailed (and extensive) annotated primary bibliography, including all known reprints (both English and foreign-language), together with a brief secondary bibliography. The volume is particularly notable for the research done by the compilers in identifying Tubb's contributions outside the sf/fantasy genre under a variety of pseudonyms.\n\nThe three volumes are as follows:\n\nSubject of Bibliography Latest Edition Price Notes Barrington J. Bayley 1980 £0.50 ($1.00) Ken Bulmer 2nd, 8/84 £1.00 E.C Tubb 1998 £12.00\n\nContact Details\n\nI believe that the Bayley & Bulmer titles are long out of print, but the best bet would be to contact the man behind all the BECCON Publications:\n\nRoger Robinson, 75 Rossyln Avenue, HAROLD WOOD, Essex, RH3 0RG, ENGLAND (www.beccon.org)\n\nThe Borgo Press\n\nThe Borgo Press was the brainchild of Michael Burgess (aka Robert Reginald) and was primarily concerned with publishing library editions of items from other small presses (including several of the other bibliography series listed here). It's focus has always been on the library audience with the results that the books tend to be fairly expensive (although the author bibliographies are all available in trade paperback). Note that prices were never quoted on the volumes themselves and were adjusted (for inflation) as time went by.\n\nThe series at question (\"Bibliographies of Modern Authors\") provide comprehensive annotated primary and secondary bibliographies of each author, with complete listings of all appearances of the author's books, short fiction, nonfiction, interviews, juvenilia, editorial credits, drama, verse and screen work, plus all known secondary works on the author, a chronology of the author's life, and index. They are probably the most comprehensive of the modern bibliographies, hampered only by the fact that the publication cycle at The Borgo Press was so long that the cut-off date for each bibliography is typically some years before the volume actually appeared.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure exactly how many volumes there were in the series - at least 26 were announced, but some, at least, never appeared before the press folded. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Burgess' own bibliography of bibliographies lists as published a number of volumes which have never appeared. As far as I can tell, the latest editions are currently as follows:\n\nSubject of Bibliography Latest Edition Notes Brian Aldiss 1991 Charles Beaumont 2nd, 1990 not seen Gary Brandner 1995 not seen Reginald Bretnor 1989 not seen Elizabeth Chater 1995 not seen Jack Dann 1989 not seen Jeffrey M.

Temple 1994 Jack Vance 1994 distributed by Underwood/Miller Ian Watson 1989 Colin Wilson 1989 not seen George Zebrowski 3rd, 1996 not seen\n\nIn addition, the following titles were announced and may, or may not, exist:\n\nRaymond Z. Gallun\n\nMartin H. Greenberg\n\nwhile the following announced titles definitely did not appear:\n\nOrson Scott Card\n\nHarry Harrison\n\nJoseph Payne Brennan\n\nContact Details\n\nIronically, for a publisher who did so much to preserve ephemera for a wider audience, The Borgo Press themselves closed their doors in 1999 and dispersed their remaining stock so there is no direct source for the remaining bibliographies. UK collectors would be best advised to contact the UK distributor, who may still have copies of some titles available:\n\nPaupers' Press, 27 Melbourne Road, West Bridgford, NOTTINGHAM, NG2 5DJ, ENGLAND (pauper.stormloader.com/borgo.htm)\n\nA version of the Borgo Press imprint was revived by The Wildside Press, but this does not seem to include the bibliographies.\n\nChris Drumm\n\nChris Drumm was best known as one of the top mail-order sf specialists in the USA, but in the 1980s he produced a series of bibliographies that were very similar in intent (and low price!) to the Galactic Central series. During the 1990s, however, the demands of the mail order business left him no time for bibliographies and the series ground to a halt. In 1998 the series was formally merged with Galactic Central, with Chris Drumm becoming the US agent for the Galactic Central series, and Galactic Central completing the final, unpublished, volume of the series (John Sladek).\n\nAlthough most of the volumes in the series bear the modest title of \"checklist\", they are much more extensive than this, typically containing information on all published works by the author (fiction and non-fiction), listing all known English-language editions. The earlier formats tend to favour economy over legibility (with very small, cramped, text) although this was relaxed in later volumes.\n\nA total of twelve titles were published:\n\nSubject of Bibliography\n\nLatest Edition\n\nPrice Notes Algis Budrys 1982 out of print Hal Clement 1983 superseded by Galactic Central Thomas M.

Box 445, POLK CITY, IA 50226, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (cdrumm.blogspot.com)\n\nGalactic Central Publications\n\nGalactic Central was originally created by the late Gordon Benson, Jr. in the early 1980's as a way of providing the fannish community with cheap, but comprehensive, working bibliographies. He was joined in the late 1980's by Phil Stephensen-Payne, who subsequently took over the reins when Gordon's health began to fail. Most of the bibliographies are produced as A5 booklets, photocopied and side-stapled, although some of the more recent publications have been perfect-bound. The intention is to keep all bibliographies permanently in print at all times and to offer them at a price that the average (impoverished) fan can afford.\n\nThe scope of the bibliographies has grown considerably over the years. Initially only primary works of fiction in the English language were included, but 90% of the volumes now have a standard format containing seventeen separate sections including items such as poems, articles, and series as well as extensive coverage of secondary material. Unique to this series (as far as we know) is a section listing \"phantom titles\" that have either been announced but not published or, at some time, have been erroneously credited to the subject of the bibliography. Coverage of translations into languages other than English has also grown over the years and recent bibliographies contain comprehensive of translations into most major European languages.\n\nThere are currently 58 printed volumes in the series and the series is currently on hold because of pressures from other projects. It is likely that any further volumes will be made available online free of charge, although no definite plans are in place.

Grant\n\nDon Grant is one of the best respected small presses, particularly for his volumes of Robert E. Howard and Stephen King's Dark Tower series. Less well-known are the small number of bibliographies they have published over the years.\n\nAlthough not a series, as such, each of the bibliographies is immaculately researched, covering just about anything you might reasonably (or even unreasonably!) want to know about the author. The only disappointments is that the Robert E. Howard volume was published before the Howard boom of the 1980s and hence is, now, woefully incomplete.\n\nThe four volumes published to date are:\n\nSubject of Bibliography Latest Edition Notes Edgar Rice Burroughs 2001 Revised extensively from 1964 edition Robert E. Howard 1976 Superseded by The Neverending Hunt Talbot Mundy 1983 Clark Ashton Smith 1978\n\nContact Details\n\nI do not know if any of the titles are still in print, but the publisher can be contacted at:\n\nDonald M. Grant, HAMPTON FALLS, NH 03844, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n\nG.K. Hall\n\nG.K. Hall are a general publisher of reference volumes for libraries and the series in question (\"Masters of Science Fiction and Fantasy\") is no exception. Aimed directly at rich academic libraries, the books were only available in extremely expensive hardbacks and tended to devote more space to secondary material than to works by the author himself.\n\nDespite that, the volumes tended to be meticulously researched (usually with the assistance of the author) and often contained items not recorded elsewhere. Entries are generally divided into the categories of fiction, miscellaneous media and non-fiction and are usually limited to very brief details of first publication.\n\nOver a period of 5 years, 14 volumes were published covering a total of 18 authors.\n\nSubject of Bibliography Latest Edition Notes Lloyd Alexander, Evangeline Walton & Kenneth Morris 1981 not seen J.G.

Many of these volumes contain a bibliography of the author in question, but NESFA have also recently branched out into publishing a small number of standalone bibliographies.\n\nAs yet there is no common format for the bibliographies - the Norton is a revised edition of the G.K. Hall volume and follows the format of that series (although with more emphasis on primary, rather than secondary, material); the Williamson was originally written for Borgo Press and follows the format of that series; the Zelazny was written to accompany the NESFA publication of Zelazny's short stories and is similar to the Underwood/Miller format.\n\nThe two volumes are:\n\nSubject of Bibliography Latest Edition Notes Andre Norton 11/94 Updates published on NESFA web site Jack Williamson 1997 Roger Zelazny 2011\n\nContact Details"
