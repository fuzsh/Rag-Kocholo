        "text": "Faces of Olmstead\n\nThe personal stories of a few of the thousands of people whose lives have been improved by the Olmstead decision and the Department's Olmstead enforcement work.\n\nIntegrating Workers with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities in Rhode Island\n\nIn June 2013, the Department reached an Interim Settlement Agreement with the State of Rhode Island and the City of Providence to provide relief to approximately 200 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who received services from the segregated sheltered workshop and day activity service provider Training Through Placement, Inc., and the Harold A. Birch Vocational Program, a special education program which operated a segregated sheltered workshop inside a Providence high school. Under the agreement individuals will receive access to integrated supported employment and integrated day activity services, allowing them to become more active participants in the community. Here are the stories of a few individuals who have already benefited from the agreement.\n\nImproving the Lives of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities in Nebraska\n\nMental Health and Developmental Disabilities Services in Georgia\n\nIn October 2010, the United States settled its case against the State of Georgia, resolving claims that persons with mental illness or developmental disabilities were harmed by unnecessary confinement in State hospitals. The State agreed to create meaningful community services systems, including crisis services, case management, housing supports, and other services supporting full integration in daily life for persons with mental illness or developmental disabilities receiving State services. Here are stories of some of the people who have benefitted from the Georgia agreement.\n\nMental Health Services in Delaware\n\nIn July 2011, the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") signed an agreement with Delaware to transform that State's mental health system. The Agreement will help more than 3,000 individuals move into the community and out of Delaware's state operated psychiatric hospital and other state-funded psychiatric facilities or avoid having to enter these institutions to get needed services. Instead, the Agreement is aimed at providing individuals with mental disabilities those necessary supports and services to allow them to live and thrive in the community. Here are the stories of a few of the people who have already benefited from the Agreement.\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services in Virginia\n\nIn January 2012, the Department reached a settlement agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia to transform its system for serving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities from one that is heavily reliant on five institutional Training Centers to one that emphasizes community-based services. The agreement, which was approved by the Court in August 2012, will help over 5,000 people move to the community or remain in the community with appropriate supports.\n\nAs required under the Agreement, the Commonwealth of Virginia is making community-based settings available to individuals choosing to leave the State's Training Centers, and other individuals qualifying for, and in urgent need, of community services. The Virginia Board for People with Disabilities prepared a video called Place Matters about individuals who have recently transitioned from Training Centers to the community: http://www.vaboard.org/\n\nBelow are the stories of a few people whose lives have been affected by services similar to those that will be provided under the settlement.\n\nPeople with Physical Disabilities in Florida and Missouri\n\nThe Department has filed briefs in support of private suits challenging states' refusal to provide community services to people with physical disabilities in order to keep them out of nursing homes. These are the stories of a few of the people who are living in their communities as a result."
