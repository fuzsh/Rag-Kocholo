        "text": "But then, two days later, the Labor Department issued its latest jobs report, showing that the economy generated just 114,000 jobs in July, far below the recent trend, pushing the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent. Much of the increase was due to people joining or rejoining the labor force, looking for jobs but not finding them. The rate of growth in wages also fell, to just 3.6 percent compared to a year ago.\n\nThe Fed could undo some of the damage by cutting rates at its next scheduled Open Market Committee meeting in September. It has been widely expected that the Fed will finally cut rates by a quarter point. At his press conference following the recent meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, “If we were to see inflation moving down … more or less in line with expectations, growth remains reasonably strong, and the labor market remains consistent with current conditions, then I think a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting.”\n\nBut given the softness of the job market, a quarter-point cut may not be enough. Conceivably, the Fed might order a rare half-point cut, though that might signal panic. The Fed might even cut rates in between meetings, which would be a rare move and an even rarer confession of error. Alternatively, the inflation-phobic Fed might also temporize again and do too little, too late.\n\nHowever, investors are not sure what the Fed will do. Suddenly, the process of moving beyond the recent bout of inflation while avoiding a recession looks far less orderly than it did just a week ago. That sort of uncertainty always spooks markets.\n\nBefore the recent dip, the stock market enjoyed a remarkable ride, with the S&P 500 gaining almost 20 percent this year. Even the most euphoric bulls know that the stock market can’t grow more than five times as fast as the economy indefinitely. The only question was when to sell. And once a sell-off begins, other holders of stocks tend to sell before the market drops further, intensifying the bear psychology.\n\nThe Fed also got the policy wrong for a more fundamental reason. Fed economists took for granted that the bout of inflation that began with the COVID-19-induced supply chain shock reflected overheated demand. But once supply shocks subsided, most of the inflation came from other sources.\n\nTake the case of insurance. Auto insurance costs in 2023 were up more than 20 percent over the year before because cars have gotten more expensive to repair. This has nothing to do with overheated demand. Homeowners insurance is also up partly because of the costs of claims related to climate change that insurers pass along to all customers.\n\nConcentrated market power, in industries as varied as pharmaceuticals and grocery chains, gives sellers the power to raise prices on consumers. The remedy for this is antitrust enforcement, not high interest rates. The Fed has long been oblivious to structural economic factors that raise consumer prices.\n\nAnd the Fed’s own tight money policies have themselves become a source of price inflation. Consumers are paying more for mortgages and more for credit card debt. Businesses are paying more to finance their loans.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that the current sell-off began in Japan, where the central bank ordered a slight increase in the interest rate, which was sufficient to send markets plunging by 10 percent. Japan has long been plagued by deflation and interest rates that are sometimes negative, which in turn have over-valued stock markets. The Bank of Japan faces much more of a challenge than the US Federal Reserve when it comes to normalizing Japanese interest rates. But in the meantime, global economic trends can be contagious.\n\nBecause the financial markets follow their own logic, the ups and downs of the stock market may sometimes be predictive of the real economy, but they are often wrong. There’s a famous line of the economist Paul Samuelson that the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. Markets tend to overreact, and there is still a lot of strength in the US economy, which has outperformed all of the world’s other market economies in the years since recovery from the COVID-induced recession began.\n\nIf the Fed would just take its foot off the economy’s oxygen hose, the recovery could get back on track."
