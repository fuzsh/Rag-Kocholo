        "text": "Full Name Lawrence Joseph Ellison Birthday August 17, 1944 (age 79) Born New York City Net Worth $79 Billion Social Profiles Twitter, Facebook\n\nAs a long-time Larry Ellison fan, I‘ve always been fascinated by his rags-to-riches story. In this post, I‘ll provide an in-depth look at Ellison‘s journey from a college dropout to the billionaire founder of one of the most influential tech companies ever – Oracle.\n\nThe Adversity That Shaped the Oracle Founder\n\nEllison‘s challenging upbringing provided early lessons in perseverance. Born in the Bronx in 1944, Ellison was raised by his aunt and uncle in Chicago after being given up for adoption as an infant. This childhood trauma drove him to find acceptance and success later in life.\n\nThough clearly gifted, Ellison struggled to fit into the structure of school. After dropping out of two universities, he moved to California and taught himself computer programming while working odd jobs. This early adversity shaped Ellison‘s unrelenting tenacity.\n\nThe Relentless Quest Behind Oracle‘s Rise\n\nIn 1977, Ellison co-founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with just $2,000. Through 80-hour work weeks and intense demands on employees, SDL developed the Oracle database. Ellison named it after a CIA project he had worked on, foreshadowing his outsized ambitions.\n\nEllison‘s relentless drive fueled Oracle‘s massive growth as it came to dominate the database market. His competitive nature and demanding management style pushed employees to extremes. Though controversial, Ellison‘s unrelenting quest drove Oracle‘s rapid expansion. This laid the foundation for his $79 billion net worth.\n\nPioneering Cloud Computing and Shaping the Tech Industry\n\nBeyond databases, Ellison spearheaded Oracle‘s pivot to cloud-based products in the 2000s. He spent billions acquiring companies like PeopleSoft, Siebel and NetSuite to assemble Oracle‘s cloud offerings. Ellison recognized the directions that computing and business software were moving earlier than most.\n\nEllison has also served on the boards of key tech companies like Apple and Tesla. His influence extends beyond Oracle itself. The Oracle founder helped shape the tech landscape by promoting technologies like Linux, open-source databases and massively parallel processing.\n\nThough no longer CEO, Ellison‘s vision still guides Oracle as CTO and chairman. His prescient understanding of technology has made him one of the most impactful figures in Silicon Valley.\n\nLavish Lifestyle but Surprisingly Modest Habits\n\nThe Oracle founder is known for his indulgent purchases, including a Hawaiian island, yachts, sports teams and real estate. But Ellison retains some frugal habits from earlier in life. Intriguingly, he reportedly owns just a single suit that he wears for media appearances.\n\nEllison also avoids restaurant meals, preferring food made by his personal chef. And despite his luxury residences across the world, Ellison primarily lives in a modest home in Silicon Valley. While clearly enjoying the lavish trappings of his wealth, Ellison remains grounded in some ways.\n\nWhat Ellison Means to Me\n\nAs someone who came from adversity and found success through perseverance and education, Ellison has always been an inspiration. His story proves one can change their circumstances through relentless drive. Ellison overcame early setbacks and made himself into a titan of technology on his own terms.\n\nWhile Ellison‘s demanding management style has drawn criticism, I believe it comes from the intense effort required to overcome his difficult start. Ellison shows one can find acceptance and belonging through achievement. His contributions at Oracle changed the world we live in and created enormous opportunity. I feel honored to have watched this technology luminary‘s career unfold.\n\nThe Legacy Ellison Leaves Behind\n\nEllison proved visionaries can come from unlikely backgrounds. His pivotal role in databases and cloud computing provided the foundation for innumerable tech businesses. Figures like Marc Benioff, Mark Hurd and Safra Catz all emerged from under Ellison.\n\nWhile controversial at times, Ellison‘s influence is undeniable. He molded the technology landscape we live and work in today. Ellison overcame early adversity through focus and education to achieve his dreams. The Oracle founder paved the way for countless innovators who will shape the future. Ellison‘s legacy will impact technology for generations to come."
