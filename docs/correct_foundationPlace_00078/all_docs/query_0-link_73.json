        "text": "On July 5, 2022, CalHHS released the Data Exchange Framework, Data Sharing Agreement, and initial set of Policies and Procedures. Documents can be found in the respective tabs of this section. More information for signatories of the Data Sharing Agreement, including information on agreement execution, will be available on this webpage later this year (2022).\n\nContext\n\nWhile parts of California’s health care system rely on coordinated, interoperable electronic systems, other parts rely on decentralized, manual, and siloed systems of clinical and administrative data exchange that is voluntary in many situations. This voluntary patchwork imposes burdens on providers and patients, limits the health care ecosystem from making material advances in equity and quality, and functionally inhibits patient access to personalized, longitudinal health records. Further, a lack of clear policies and requirements to share data between payers, providers, hospitals, and public health systems is a significant hindrance to addressing public health crises, as demonstrated by challenges inherent to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite the widespread availability of secure electronic data transfer, a small but important minority of Californians’ medical information is stored or shared on paper. When that medical information is shared between providers, much of it happens by mail, fax, or, most likely, by the patients themselves, who frequently carry their records from appointment to appointment. While electronic health information exchange cannot replace provider-patient communication, it can greatly improve the completeness of patient records, which has a significant effect on health and wellness outcomes, as past history, current medications, and other information are jointly reviewed during appointments.\n\nSocial and economic factors distinct from medical care are powerful predictors of health outcomes and disease burden throughout a person’s life. From a population health perspective, this means that evidence-based policies that affect the broader conditions in which people are born, grow, and live can exert a powerful influence on health and well-being. From an operational perspective, data-driven efforts to better coordinate human and social supports with the medical and health care sectors provide opportunities to deliver services that are more client centered, efficient, effective, and tailored.\n\nTimeline\n\nInitial Data Exchange Framework\n\nBy July 1, 2022, the state will establish a single Data Sharing Agreement and common set of policies and procedures that will govern and require the exchange of health information among health care entities and government agencies in California. This effort will be guided by a Stakeholder Advisory Group, which will provide information and advice to CalHHS.\n\nPublic health/social services integration\n\nCalHHS and the California State Association of Counties will encourage as many county health, public health, and social services providers to connect to the Data Exchange Framework—with all state and local public health agencies exchanging health information in real time with participating health care entities.\n\nFull implementation\n\nOn or before January 31, 2024, most required signatories of the DSA shall exchange health information or provide access to health information as specified by CalHHS’s Data Sharing Agreement for treatment, payment, or health care operations.\n\nDxF Grants Program\n\nThe Data Exchange Framework (DxF) Grant Program launched in October 2022 to help health and social services providers and other health care entities understand and implement DxF requirements. There are two core grant opportunities to address areas where resources are required to support broad DxF implementation: the DSA Signatory Grants and the DxF Educational Initiative Grant Programs.\n\nDSA Signatory Grants\n\nCDII has allocated up to $47 million for DSA Signatory Grants that provide support to DSA Signatories to subsidize their efforts to implement the DxF. The program includes two grant options for Signatories: QHIO Onboarding Grants and Technical Assistance (TA) Grants. Grantees can download the DSA Signatory Grants Management Guide to learn more about the Grant Program, and how to manage their respective Grant awards.\n\nThe DxF Grant Portal is closed for the DSA Signatory Grants Round 3.\n\nCDII has designated Public Consulting Group LLC (PCG) as the third-party administrator (TPA) to administer DSA Signatory Grants and the DxF Grant portal. PCG is acting solely as a TPA on behalf of CDII and is not liable or responsible for CDII decisions, payment delays, or actions.\n\nDSA Signatory Grantee Webinar (February 29, 2024, 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM)\n\n(2/29) DxF Signatory Grantee Webinar – Presentation\n\n(2/29) Transcript\n\n(2/29) Recording\n\n(2/29) Q&A\n\nResources\n\nDSA Signatory Grants Management Guide\n\nDSA Signatory Grants Awardees\n\nDSA Signatory Grant Guidance Document\n\nDSA Signatory Application Template\n\nDSA Signatory Grants 101\n\nDxF Grant Program Overview Document\n\nDSA Grant Tutorial video\n\nDSA Signatory Grants Round 3 Informational Webinar Presentation\n\nDSA Signatory Grants Round 3 Informational Webinar Recording\n\nTechnical Assistance Grantee Milestones Recording\n\nTechnical Assistance Grantee Milestones Presentation\n\nQHIO Onboarding Grantee Milestones Recording\n\nQHIO Onboarding Grantee Milestones Presentation\n\nDxF Educational Initiative Grant Program\n\nIn December 2022, CDII selected eight associations to provide education and outreach about the DxF across the state throughout 2023. The list of grantees and their contact information can be found in the DxF FAQ document, question 16."
