        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis guide was created to serve as an essential resource for professionals navigating the intricacies of software licensing. With the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, managing licenses efficiently and compliantly is paramount. This guide offers clarity on foundational concepts and advanced strategies and will ensure that readers are well-equipped to implement best practices in real-world scenarios.\n\nScope\n\nOracle’s foundation and history is as an enterprise software company. Accordingly, its cloud solutions provide a variety of mobility programs to benefit customer use of Oracle software licenses (estate) in the cloud. Identifying and analyzing the benefiOts of these programs requires ongoing use of FinOps and ITAM/SAM best practices to manage diverse cloud models – including private, public, hybrid, multi-dimensional and distributed.\n\nThere are several core topics that are interrelated and pivotal to thoroughly understand Oracle cloud services, subscriptions, mobility programs (BYOL), and the ongoing consumption management of Oracle cloud services and licenses in the context of these interdependencies.\n\nCloud Services Cloud Subscriptions License Mobility Programs Support Relief Programs Other Clouds Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) / IaaS-PaaS\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud Applications / SaaS\n\nCloud@Customer\n\nAgreements / Contracts\n\nUniversal Credits / Pricing\n\nBYOL to IaaS-OCI (Lift & Shift)\n\nBYOL to PaaS\n\nCustomer 2 Cloud (C2C) for SaaS\n\nOracle Support Rewards (OSR) Authorized Cloud\n\nAWS\n\nAzure\n\nTechnologies and core service platforms Policies that govern the use and cost of cloud services Programs available that span on-premises licenses and cloud services Options for leveraging cloud investment / use to reduce on-premises support spend Using Oracle technology in other cloud environments\n\nAmong these topics, this guide will emphasize Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as the representative cloud service, BYOL to PaaS as the representative mobility program and Oracle Support Rewards (OSR) as the representative support relief program for outlining the strategies within the Licensing Optimization Strategy and BYOL Strategy sections herein.\n\nBYOL Overview\n\nThis guide provides best practices for the FinOps practitioner when leveraging Oracle on-premises licenses for BYOL deployments in the cloud. Leveraging existing on-premises license investment can represent a cost-efficient way to migrate and sustain workloads in the cloud. Oracle provides several options that are designed to optimize existing license investment as part of the migration to cloud.\n\nA FinOps practitioner can leverage Oracle license management strategies in conjunction with FinOps best practices to optimize the organization’s Oracle license investment. A successful license management strategy incorporates several elements:\n\nEvaluation of options\n\nManaging license deployments across a breadth of cloud environments\n\nUnderstanding license contracts and obligations\n\nUsing tooling to support license management\n\nOptimizing cloud migration programs\n\nApplying FinOps practices\n\nPlease consult the Definitions section for additional detail on the terminology used in this document.\n\nBYOL is concerned with deploying unused license capacity and / or ear-marked license migration capacity to fulfill the license element of Oracle products and services deployed in the cloud. There are two high level categories of BYOL license deployment:\n\nInstallation of Oracle products on infrastructure in the cloud that are wholly installed and managed by the customer. The customer has responsibility for ongoing management, patching and updating in this case.\n\nOracle Managed Cloud Services, where Oracle has responsibility for management, patching updates, facilitating quality of services, etc. In some cases, these services may include additional capability over and above the customer-installed and managed products. To benefit from a lower service rate, the customer can allocate an unused and supported on-premises license to fulfill the license component of the service. For cloud services in the Oracle technology space, these are referred to as BYOL to PaaS services.\n\nIn many Oracle technology deployments, there is likely to be a blend of different BYOL types and cloud environments where the license pool is deployed. These different environments and BYOL types are covered by separate policies.\n\nOracle PaaS & IaaS Universal Credits and Funded Allocation Models\n\nThe Universal Credit model is the prime buying and consumption model that is used to purchase Oracle-managed cloud services. The Funded Allocation model, which is a limited offering subject to authorization by Oracle,offers a variant from Universal Credits and supports consistent spending requirements typically seen in the public sector. Under these models, a broad range of Oracle Managed Cloud Services are made available that can be used very flexibly on demand. For many services under these models, they can be subscribed to in either BYOL to PaaS mode or License Included mode. As the name suggests, License Included means that a license is included in the cloud service price. For BYOL to PaaS, the cloud service price is lower to reflect the fact that the customer is providing an unused and supported license from their existing investment, which is dedicated to the cloud service.\n\nA key policy document to observe throughout the use of a Universal Credits or Funded Allocation subscription is the Oracle PaaS & IaaS Universal Credits Service Descriptions – Oracle UCM v090723. This document outlines details of the services and provides specifics on the licenses that need to be maintained to cover the BYOL to PaaS services. This includes ensuring that the correct license type is in place (as embedded licenses cannot be used for BYOL to PaaS) and the license being used maintains its type – including any restrictions. These service descriptions go on to detail the license requirements for each BYOL to PaaS service. The conversion rate is given – typically from Processors or NUPs to OCPUs, and in the case of databases, it specifies which license options and management packs are required to be included as well.\n\nGiven that licenses can potentially be deployed very flexibly (in the case of Oracle managed BYOL to PaaS, licenses are only required to match usage which may fluctuate), it is important that disciplined license management is in place.\n\nUnderstanding Oracle Licensing\n\nLicense Types\n\nFull-Use Licenses are the most common end-customer licenses and typically allow usage that is full functionality. Generally, one processor license for enterprise products will give you 2 OCPUs or 2 VCPUs. Restrictions you have in the license terms apply to the cloud rights as well.\n\nOracle ASFU licenses are application-specific full-use licenses that are specific to run only with a defined application and may come with additional restrictions. Typically, Oracle partners resell ASFU licenses with their specified application. This license can only be used for the specific application it was purchased for if it moves to the cloud.\n\nProprietary Application Hosting Licenses (subject to an ISV amendment from Oracle)\n\nBYOL Qualified – All BYOL qualified licenses must have an active support agreement for the CSI / license agreement. Unsupported licenses cannot be used for Oracle BYOL programs.\n\nOracle Embedded Software Licenses (ESL) (not eligible for BYOL usage)\n\nPublic Cloud and Private Cloud – Oracle BYOL is available for OCI public cloud and Cloud at Customer (C@C) private cloud environments.\n\nImportant License-Related Terms\n\nTransition period – Oracle allows customers to run on-premises and BYOL simultaneously for up to 100 days with OCI (PaaS / IaaS) platforms and 6 months with C2C (SaaS) platforms.\n\nConversion Ratios – License metric to cloud metric conversion ratios, which will vary by solution entity or type; conversion ratios can be round in services descriptions documentation: Oracle UCM v090723.\n\nLicense Editions\n\nBelow is a graphical representation of the license editions for Oracle Database in the cloud. The most popular editions across the technology stack are Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition. (There is only Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition for databases. Other options include Autonomous database.)\n\nLicense-Included\n\nBYOL\n\nRepresentative Unit Pricing\n\nBYOL unit pricing for PaaS and IaaS Cloud Services (if available) is significantly lower than License-Included unit pricing (up to 80-90% lower in some cases). Below is a representative comparison between unit pricing for License-Included options (standard unit pricing by license type and edition) and a related BYOL option (license type and edition are pursuant to the license held by the customer under its relevant licensing agreement).\n\nDatabase Versions Unit Price* Metric Oracle Base Database Service – Standard $0.2150 OCPU Per Hour Oracle Base Database Service – Enterprise $0.4301 OCPU Per Hour Oracle Base Database Service – High Performance $0.8871 OCPU Per Hour Oracle Base Database Service – Extreme Performance $1.3441 OCPU Per Hour Oracle Base Database Service – BYOL $0.1935 OCPU Per Hour *Pricing as of August 10, 2023. For Current Pricing:\n\nhttps://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/pricing/oracle-paas-and-iaas-global-price-list.pdf\n\nLicense Metrics\n\nFor technology products, the most popular license metrics are:\n\nNamed User Plus (NUP): Used in environments where users and/or devices can be easily identified and counted. All human users and non-human operating devices that are accessing the software must be licensed.\n\nProcessor (xCPU): Used in environments where software users cannot be easily identified and counted, like Internet-based applications.\n\nLicense Mobility Programs\n\nOracle’s core mobility programs are separated by IaaS / PaaS and SaaS programs.\n\nOracle BYOL to PaaS allows organizations to apply their existing on-premises licenses for equivalent cloud services, including PaaS / IaaS (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) and SaaS (Oracle Cloud Applications). Key guidelines for BYOL:\n\nOrganizations may activate the BYOL version of a Cloud Service if it’s available on the pricelist (not all Cloud Services have BYOL versions).\n\nOrganizations are charged the BYOL rate for the activated Cloud Service provided they have sufficient supported on-premises licenses as required and specified in the Service Description for the Cloud Service Oracle UCM v09072\n\nThe Organization remains responsible for compliance with any license restrictions applicable to the on-premises licenses (including metrics), as defined in the Ordering Document for those licenses.\n\nThe following license types may be applied towards use in a BYOL Cloud Service environment: Full Use, Limited Use, Application Specific Full Use and Proprietary Hosting (subject to an ISV amendment). Term licenses are eligible for BYOL if the term of the license is still in effect.\n\nEmbedded Software Licenses are not eligible for BYOL\n\nEntitlement is the same number of OCPUs or other cloud metric to support the same number of associated on-premises licenses applied toward the BYOL Cloud Service environment.\n\nThe license type is retained as applied toward the BYOL Cloud Service environment (examples: Full Use stays as Full Use and Limited Use stays as Limited Use).\n\nLicenses applied toward the BYOL version of a Cloud Service are deemed deployed and in use (i.e. these licenses may not be used on-premises while applied toward BYOL version of a Cloud Service – except within the first 100 days of use.\n\nOracle Customer to Cloud (C2C) allows organizations using ERP, EPM, HCM, and CRM application solutions across all product families (i.e. Siebel, Peoplesoft, JD Edwards and Oracle E-Business Suite) to redirect elements of their installed on-premises solutions to Oracle Applications Cloud within the same product family. This Program allows organizations to use current support spend to move to cloud applications SaaS.\n\nSupport Relief Programs\n\nOracle Support Rewards (OSR) allows organizations with a Universal Credit order for Cloud Services to accrue support spend rewards from their OCI cloud spend. OSR benefits organizations with on-premises licenses and related support while using OCI. For every dollar spent on OCI, the organization accrues 25 cents of OSR benefits, which can be applied to technology license support. For ULA support, OSR accrue at 33 cents for every dollar spent on OCI. OSR benefits may accrue up to 100% of the applicable support spend of the organization. OSR does not apply to Oracle Cloud Applications (OCA) or related Oracle application license support.\n\nAddition Programs and Notes\n\nOracle Cloud @ Customer (C@C) allows organizations to run OCI services and Oracle Fusion SaaS applications at their data center. Accordingly, Oracle’s license mobility programs are available under the Cloud @ Customer programs, which include the following variations: Dedicated Region C@C, Autonomous Database Exadata C@C, Exadata C@C and Compute C@C.\n\nLicense-Included PaaS has licenses and support included in the PaaS Cloud Services offering. It is a “cloud-only” offering. License-included rates are higher than BYOL rates, which are discounted for use of an organization’s existing license entitlements (and corresponding support payments) as equivalent Cloud Services. Some notable differences between License-Included PaaS and BYOL to PaaS:\n\nBYOL requires active management of the licenses and support applied in the BYOL program (for equivalent Cloud Services), License-Included has no similar license management requirement.\n\nNot all License-Included PaaS offerings have a BYOL to PaaS counterpart. There are cloud-only services within License-Included PaaS that have no on-premises analog or potential BYOL application; some examples of this are: Oracle Mobile Cloud, Oracle API Platform Cloud Service, Oracle Internet of Things Cloud Service, and Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service\n\nLicensing Optimization Strategy\n\nHere are some guidelines for managing license and cloud consumption in multi-dimensional cloud and on-premises environments:\n\nEntitlements\n\nKnow your on-premises license and cloud services contracts, rights and terms of use\n\nKnow your related contract and asset / service cycles, duration and related renewal decision milestones\n\nDeployment / Consumption\n\nKnow your consumption levels of license and cloud – current, past and trends\n\nIdentify BYOL to PaaS opportunities\n\nIdentify OSR support relief benefits from OCI consumption\n\nReview ITAM / FinOps management responsibilities under BYOL and OSR programs\n\nInvestment Economics\n\nIdentify viable BYOL and OSR options\n\nDevelop TCO analyses for all viable options\n\nOptimize BYOL and OSR options\n\nOperate\n\nSet the ITAM / FinOps on-premises deployment/cloud consumption review cycle at a (weekly / monthly / quarterly) cadence\n\nManage and optimize deployment/consumption and related TCO\n\nSet controls and governance decisions and automate (refine process)\n\nBYOL Strategy\n\nBring Your Own License (BYOL) programs have unique parameters and features by vendor. The primary subscription model for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is Universal Credits. The main features of Universal Credits for organizations to understand in contemplating Oracle BYOL strategies include 1) Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) vs. Annual Flex plans, and 2) BYOL vs. License-Included options; a comprehensive BYOL Strategy for OCI also includes understanding of 3) Oracle Support Rewards. Note: License-Included and BYOL relationships for Oracle licenses in authorized clouds, such as AWS and Azure, act similarly; however, price impact is unique to each cloud service provider.\n\nPay As You Go (PAYG) Annual Flex Plans No upfront commitment or payment\n\nList Price\n\nPay only for what you use\n\nPay in arrears based upon usage\n\nSuitable to uncertain and flexible requirements\n\nUpfront commitment of credits and payment; applied across Cloud Services consumption\n\nVolume purchase discount price\n\n12-month period to consume credits (“use it or lose it”); unused credits expire at end of period; excess consumption is charged at unit rate level on the rate card to end of period\n\nBeneficial to known, longer term and predictable requirements that may be aggregated, committed and discounted\n\nLicense-Included BYOL Cloud Services that include license and support; “cloud only” offering\n\nHigher subscription pricing than BYOL\n\nNot Limited – all Cloud Services have a License-Included (standard cloud-only) version\n\nNo corresponding license management or compliance requirements related to consumption of cloud services\n\nExisting licenses and support applied toward equivalent Cloud Services; allows customers to leverage unused supported licenses for a lower rate BYOL version of a Cloud ServiceLimited – to Cloud Services with a BYOL version and license types qualified for BYOL use\n\nDiscounted – BYOL versions of Cloud Services are substantially discounted and at lower rates than License-Included versions\n\nRequires strict inventory control measures to ensure license compliance\n\nIdentify BYOL Opportunities\n\nMany organizations have made large investments in on-premises tools and applications by purchasing Perpetual or Term software licenses. Not leveraging the existing license entitlements when migrating a workload from on-premises to the cloud would often lead to organizations duplicating the cost of a software solution in the cloud. The goal would be to use Oracle BYOL for licenses under active support to migrate these licenses to the public cloud environment where appropriate and avoid paying additional on-demand fees to cover the Oracle license fees.\n\nMany organizations have excess Oracle licenses that were historically purchased for workloads that may have been retired since. These excess licenses may be available to use as BYOL for workloads that may have been created in the cloud computing environment. By using excess licenses that the organization owns and has under active support, the organization may avoid paying additional on-demand fees to cover Oracle licenses.\n\nSome workloads created in the cloud have a steady state nature. A TCO analysis should be performed to determine the most cost-effective method of licensing the workload, either by using on-demand licensing or alternatively procuring Oracle Term or Perpetual licenses under existing organizational Oracle agreements.\n\nOracle BYOL allows you to use eligible Oracle licenses in any authorized public cloud environment.\n\nBYOL eligibility depends on the license model and whether the license has active support license edition.\n\nSome organizations have an Unlimited License Agreement (ULA). Each Ordering Document under a ULA (order) may specify licensed products for Unlimited use and the corresponding Unlimited Deployment Period of such licensed products – these licensed products must be assessed whether they are suitable for cloud use post certification process. At the end of the ULA, customers must notify Oracle whether they intend to (a) extend the ULA, or (b) certify the ULA and complete the ULA certification process (to end with the certified amounts of the products specified in the order).\n\nTransition period: Oracle allows customers to run on-premises and BYOL for up to 100 days. After that, a customer cannot run both on-premises and BYOL with the same license.\n\nOracle customers should consider all public cloud platforms when deciding which is the most cost-effective and best choice to move the Oracle workload.\n\nOracle customers who will utilize Oracle Cloud or Oracle Cloud @ Customer need to assess whether purchasing new Oracle PaaS and IaaS Universal Cloud Credits or using BYOL is the most cost-effective choice for them.\n\nAssess BYOL Feasibility\n\nFinOps should evaluate the license cost of the solution and determine whether the use of BYOL would increase its cost effectiveness.\n\nTo assess the cost of BYOL, FinOps should collaborate with ITAM to understand whether there are licenses available and if so, at what cost.\n\nOther sources that may be consulted to advise on the license positions and feasibility are:\n\nOracle Global License Advisory Services (GLAS): Provides advisory services via two teams 1) Software Investment Advisory Services (SIA) and 2) Digital Transformation Consulting (DTC). Both SIA and DTC provide no-cost advisory services to assist Oracle customers with licensing, cloud and mobility program reporting, analysis, knowledge transfer and solution guidance.\n\nOracle Partner Network (OPN) consultants and advisors: There are many ITAM/SAM advisors who are part of the OPN and Oracle has launched a certified SAM Partner Program to further develop its advisor community.\n\nwww.oracle.com/partnernetwork/program/\n\nhttps://partner-finder.oracle.com/catalog/\n\nIndependent consultants and advisors – there are independent ITAM/SAM advisors who are outside of the Oracle Partner Network as well; a good place to discover these advisors would be professional ITAM/SAM communities.\n\nhttps://itassetmanagement.net/\n\nhttps://iaitam.org/\n\nITAM should be consulted to understand the compliance requirements of using BYOL, the tools that would need to be implemented and the processes required to maintain compliance while using BYOL.\n\nDefine BYOL Policies\n\nBYOL: www.oracle.com/cloud/bring-your-own-license/faq/\n\nOracle Support Rewards (OSR): www.oracle.com/cloud/rewards\n\nPaaS IaaS Universal Credits Service Descriptions: Oracle UCM v090723\n\nImplement BYOL Management Tools\n\nOracle recommends a number of third-party tools for the tracking and auditing of their software: Tooling | License Management Services | Oracle\n\nTo ensure continuous compliance when using BYOL, it is recommended that tools are evaluated and implemented within 90 days or less to enable software license compliance tracking.\n\nCollaboration between FinOps and ITAM should be ongoing to ensure that ITAM can track the license usage as determined by the inventory tools in the cloud.\n\nOCI License Manager has BYOL tracking and management capabilities as well: OCI License Manager (BYOL)\n\nEducate and Communicate\n\nUsing BYOL may generate significant financial benefits to the organization, however, the risk of non-compliance with Oracle license agreements will increase.\n\nITAM Practitioners and FinOps Practitioners need to closely align to ensure compliance and cost optimization of resources.\n\nStakeholders must be educated on the risk versus reward of using BYOL licenses and installation of BYOL licenses must be closely monitored.\n\nOperate\n\nITAM/FinOps on-premises deployment/cloud consumption review cycle is set at a (weekly/monthly/quarterly) cadence\n\nManage and optimize deployment/consumption and related TCO\n\nMonitor/assess BYOL and OSR versus alternative options\n\nSet controls and governance decisions and automate (refine process).\n\nMaintaining Compliance\n\nWhen using Oracle BYOL, there are several key points to consider for license management and compliance:\n\nITAM/FinOps must manage both the on-premises and cloud deployments to ensure there are adequate licenses to cover both platforms.\n\nIf the organization has signed an Oracle Unlimited License Agreement order (ULA), the ULA can be used for BYOL, which can reduce costs.\n\nTypically, at the end of a ULA, the organization that entered into the ULA is required to certify the number of licenses that it has in use (installed and running) at the end of the ULA. However, Oracle excludes all BYOL deployments in public cloud environments from being included in the ULA certification upon exit. Oracle workloads in the cloud will need to be separately licensed once the ULA has come to an end.\n\nITAM should review the Oracle licensing agreements for usage limitations as these will continue to apply post transition to BYOL.\n\nOracle has launched a License Manager function for Oracle BYOL, but it only covers a limited set of Oracle licenses.\n\nDefinitions\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): A diverse portfolio of Oracle managed cloud services made available in both public and private clouds. These cloud services encompass Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).\n\nOracle Universal Credits (UC): Oracle Universal Credits is a flexible buying and consumption program for specific Oracle services. It provides a predictable, consistent way to pay for any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) service in any region, including future releases of cloud services.\n\nOracle Cloud Pay As You Go (PAYG): Pay as You Go services allow quick provisioning with no commitment, and charge only for IaaS and PaaS services used. There is no upfront commitment and no minimum service period. Any cloud infrastructure and platform services consumed are metered and billed based on that consumption.\n\nAnnual Flex: The Annual-Flex Oracle Universal Credits model requires an annual commitment to Oracle, in which customers receive a discounted rate and have 12 months to burn down the credits. Any unused credits at the end of each annual period will be forfeited.\n\nFunded Allocation Model: Oracle allows the flexibility to fund an annual amount to Oracle as specified in the “Funded Allocation Value”, which is to be applied towards the future usage of eligible Oracle IaaS and PaaS Cloud Services; this is a limited availability model, typically available for Public Sector customers.\n\nPerpetual license: A perpetual license is a license type available after paying a one-time license fee that allows continued use of the software program for as long as the licensing organization continues to comply with all terms of the license agreement.\n\nTerm license: A term license is a license type available for a specific (limited) period of time, during which the licensing organization is allowed to access and use the software.\n\nRestricted license: Some products may carry a Restricted Use clause where the license can only be used under a set of documented conditions, such as with a specified program.\n\nOCPU: OCPUs represent physical CPU cores. Most CPU architectures, including x86, execute two threads per physical core, so 1 OCPU is the equivalent of 2 vCPUs for x86-based compute in Oracle Cloud.\n\nVCPU: Virtual CPU is the number of processors that are allocated to a virtual machine.\n\nECPU: Elastic CPU is a new billing metric for Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing. An ECPU is based on the number of cores per hour elastically allocated from a pool of compute and storage servers. An ECPU is not explicitly defined in terms of an amount of physical hardware; it is a durable pricing metric which is not tied to the exact make, model, or clock speed of the underlying processor.\n\nLicense Mobility: Oracle License Mobility is a program that allows customers to use their existing software licenses for Oracle (PaaS) cloud offerings, including Oracle Database, Middleware and Analytics.\n\nActive Support: BYOL to PaaS qualifying licenses must have an active support agreement for the CSI / license agreement. Unsupported licenses cannot be used for Oracle BYOL license mobility programs.\n\nUnlimited License Agreement (ULA): An on-premises licensing model that recognizes customer commitment to Oracle products and builds in flexible future license growth.
