        "text": "Red Hat Summit 2024, Denver and Austin, Texas - May 6, 2024 —\n\nRed Hat, Inc., the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, and Oracle today announced the general availability of Red Hat OpenShift on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Compute Virtual Machines (VMs). Red Hat OpenShift is the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes for architecting, building, and deploying cloud-native applications. Offering a distributed cloud of 69 regions and counting, OCI can run Red Hat OpenShift in the location and operations model that best meets customer needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The new offering builds on the collaboration between Red Hat and Oracle that began with the certification of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for OCI bare metal and Oracle VMware Cloud Solution workloads.\n\nThe combination of Red Hat Enterprise Linux certification and Red Hat OpenShift gives customers the confidence to install, migrate, and run Red Hat OpenShift workloads on OCI, supported by existing and transparent support agreements between Red Hat and Oracle. Red Hat OpenShift on OCI is supported for customer-managed installations using validated configurations of Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine.\n\nCustomers can now extend their Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem to include installations on OCI, managed from their Red Hat portal. Customers can choose from multiple installation methods, including Red Hat OpenShift Assisted Installer, command line, and agent-based, which enables installation in air-gapped environments. Oracle is providing Container Storage Interface (CSI) software that enables OCI storage integration with Red Hat OpenShift, and Cloud Control Manager (CCM) software that enables API interoperation between OCI and Red Hat OpenShift platform.\n\nOCI’s distributed cloud includes Oracle Government Cloud regions in the U.S., U.K., and Australia; OCI Dedicated Regions at customer-controlled sites; partner-enabled Oracle Alloy regions; Compute Cloud@Customer in customers’ data centers; and Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud. Red Hat OpenShift versions 4.14 and 4.15 are validated for installation on OCI Compute flexible virtual machine shapes, available in each of these offerings. This deployment flexibility is especially critical for organizations in industries with complex regulatory environments such as telecommunications, finance, and healthcare, as well as organizations operating across multiple jurisdictions. OCI Compute flexible virtual machine shapes and OCI Block Storage auto-tuning volumes optimize performance at one-half the compute and one-third the storage prices of other hyperscalers, respectively. Bare metal validation is planned in the future.\n\nLearn more about Red Hat OpenShift on OCI at the Red Hat Summit on May 6-9 in Denver, Colorado.\n\nAbout Red Hat OpenShift\n\nRed Hat OpenShift, the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes, brings together tested and trusted services to reduce the friction of developing, modernizing, deploying, running and managing applications—delivering a consistent experience across public cloud, on-premise, hybrid cloud, or edge architecture. Red Hat OpenShift is available as a turnkey application platform from major cloud providers to empower customers with the flexibility to modernize and scale in the cloud of their choice.\n\nRed Hat Summit\n\nJoin the Red Hat Summit keynotes to hear the latest from Red Hat executives, customers and partners:\n\nThe cloud is hybrid.
