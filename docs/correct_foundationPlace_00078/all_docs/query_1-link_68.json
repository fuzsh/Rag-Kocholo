        "text": "“One small step for VMware & Oracle , one giant leap for VMware & Oracle mutual customers”\n\nVMware is thrilled to announce a new strategic alliance with Oracle Corp to support our mutual customers’ hybrid cloud strategies.\n\nThe centerpiece of this relationship is a new service that will be offered by Oracle called Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.\n\nFull text of the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution announcement and press release can be found here :\n\nhttp://www.vmware.com/go/vmware-oracle-cloud\n\nThis service will enable customers to run VMware Cloud Foundation on Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud infrastructure. But equally important for the thousands of customers running Oracle software on VMware today in their data centers, Oracle and VMware have entered into a new mutual support agreement for currently supported Oracle products running on VMware environments.\n\nQuote from the mutual support agreement. “Oracle shall, using reasonable efforts, support Oracle customers with active support contracts running supported versions of Oracle products in Oracle supported computing environments who encounter problems when running those products on VMware virtualized environments.”\n\nOracle on VMware customers can now run and implement with enhanced confidence that two of their most strategic vendors are fully aligned and are committed to addressing support issues when running Oracle software in VMware environments.\n\nThis announcement was made by Larry Ellison, CEO Oracle Corporation at the keynote on Monday September 16th, 2019.\n\nVideo snippet of Larry Ellison announcing the VMware Oracle Partnership Announcement at OOW Sept 16th, 2019 can be found here .\n\nFull video of Larry Ellison talk about VMware at the Day 1 Keynotes at Oracle Open World can be found here.\n\nJohn Gilmartin, GM and SVP , ISBU VMware re-iterated the value of the strategic alliance between VMware and Oracle in the keynote on Tuesday September 17th, 2019.\n\nFull video of John Gilmartin on stage with Oracle execs on Day 2 keynote at Oracle Open World can be found here.\n\nCustomer Support for Oracle on VMware\n\nAdditionally, customers will have access to Oracle technical support for Oracle products running on VMware environments. When the Oracle support statement is updated, it will enable customers to achieve quicker time to resolution of issues.\n\nOracle will support customers with active support contracts running supported versions of Oracle products in Oracle supported computing environments.\n\nhttps://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oow19-oracle-and-vmware-091619.html\n\nFrom Reuters :\n\nOracle Corp and VMware Inc on Monday announced a deal designed to resolve years of tension over how Oracle handles technical support for VMware users and make it easier for them to move to Oracle’s cloud computing service. The two companies said that Oracle would offer technical support to customers who run its applications on top of VMware.\n\nOracle and VMware have clashed in the past over the issue. Oracle said on Monday it would now provide support for those situations.\n\n“Customers don’t want to deploy two products unless it’s supported by both vendors. This was a stumbling block for the past two decades,” said Sanjay Poonen, chief operating officer for customer operations at VMware, said in an interview. “Our relationship with Oracle is significantly better than it was 20 years ago. It’s a new day.”\n\nIn addition to the above , VMware & Oracle had 3 booth theater sessions , 2 sessions at the The Exchange Lobby (Moscone South) – Cloud Infrastructure Theater , September 18th , 10.15 am – 10.35 am and 1.15 am – 1.35 pm to reiterate the same message.\n\nVideo recording of the VMware & Oracle Team booth theater presentation at the Dell Booth on Sept 18, 2019 can be found here .\n\nVideo snippet of VMware & Oracle Team answering customer questions at the Dell Booth on Sept 18, 2019 can be found here .\n\nPlease go to the VMware and Applications Blog site and specifically to the “Oracle on VMware One-Stop-Shop” blog for an FAQ on the enhanced support agreement and the strategic alliance between Oracle and VMware.\n\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/apps/oracle\n\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/apps/2017/01/oracle-vmware-collateral-one-stop-shop.html\n\nhttps://www.vmware.com/solutions/business-critical-apps/oracle-virtualization.html\n\nhttps://www.oracle.com/cloud/VMware/\n\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/announcing-a-certified-vmware-solution-on-oracle-cloud"
