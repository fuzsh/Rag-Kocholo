        "text": "The Oracle Arena is an indoor arena located in Oakland, California, and is the home of the Golden State Warriors. With a total capacity of 19,596, it is the largest of the three NBA arenas in California and the oldest arena in the NBA. The venue also hosts many other events, such as concerts and family shows. Oracle Arena underwent a huge $100 million renovation in 1996, with a complete redesign of the interior of the building. The capacity was increased, and 72 luxury suites and three exclusive clubs were added. The AEG community foundation runs programs at the venue which involve anyone in the community, especially families and children, encouraging fund raising and educational programs."
