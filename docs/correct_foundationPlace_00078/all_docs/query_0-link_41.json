        "text": "REDWOOD CITY — Oracle said Tuesday it will build a home on its corporate campus for an innovative charter high school — a first in Silicon Valley’s growing devotion to education.\n\nThe new building will house the fledgling Design Tech High School, which will move from its current site in Burlingame into the new, 64,000-square-foot building in 2017, where there will be room for 550 students and 30 staff.\n\nIn one act of generosity, Oracle is solving one of the most pressing problems any charter school has, said Emily Bertelli, spokesman for the California Charter Schools Association.\n\n“Access to adequate school facilities is one of the most significant challenges facing charter schools today,” she said. “It’s exciting to see a new partnership like this one that will hopefully allow the school to meet their current and future educational programs.”\n\nThe past few years have seen Silicon Valley tech companies become deeply involved in education initiatives, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s backing of a new preschool and K-8 school in East Palo Alto, announced last week, and his donation of $100 million to New Jersey schools.\n\nDesign Tech will reach out to minorities and girls, two underserved groups in science and technology. The school drew Oracle’s interest at a conference the company held last year.\n\n“They stood out as rock stars” said Colleen Cassity, executive director of the Oracle Education Foundation.\n\nOpen for little more than a year, Design Tech is already in its second temporary home, a space owned by the San Mateo County Office of Education.\n\nBut in two years, the school will move into a gleaming, sinuous structure that will sit on nearly three acres near the Belmont Slough on part of Oracle’s sprawling Redwood Shores headquarters site. The company will own the building. It is not disclosing the cost of what is clearly a multimillion dollar endeavor.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz said Tuesday that the company’s founder, Larry Ellison, told her 17 years ago “he’d love to have a school where students learn to think.”\n\nDesign Tech is a public school and is open to anyone in California. The staff and operations will be funded by the local high school district, grants and some private funding. It will focus on “STEAM” subjects — science, technology, engineering, arts and math, subjects that have become a popular cause in Silicon Valley. Oracle volunteers will work closely with Design Tech students on science and technology projects.\n\nThe new building stems from a relationship between the Oracle Education Foundation and Design Tech that grew over the past year following an Oracle-organized conference of nine local high schools, including Design Tech.\n\n“It was the beginning of a partnership that grew and grew over time,” Cassity said. Behind the affinity between the school and the foundation was a problem-solving protocol called “design thinking” that the foundation is interested in and the school teaches.\n\nThe school was cofounded by its executive director Ken Montgomery, a Stanford grad with a doctorate in administration and policy analysis, and a veteran of more than a decade of teaching, largely in San Diego.\n\nAccording to Design Tech’s website, “design thinking, also known as human-centered design, is rooted in the belief that all problems, even seemingly intractable ones, are solvable.”\n\nMontgomery said Tuesday that he founded the school to put design thinking into practice. He said he found it a powerful tool as a teacher. But although “tech” is its middle name, Design Tech will not be a traditional tech school, he said.\n\nEvery student will get a laptop computer, he said, but technology isn’t a goal but a means.\n\n“It’s not a technology school in the traditional sense,” Montgomery said. “We believe the world is changing so quickly and unpredictably, any specific skill might become obsolete. We teach mindset, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity and collaboration.”"
