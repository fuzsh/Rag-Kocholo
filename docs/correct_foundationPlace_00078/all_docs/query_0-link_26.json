Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nOracle did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, in the thick of the pandemic, the company relocated from Silicon Valley — its home since 1977 — to Austin, Texas. At the time, the company said it would help offer workers more flexibility.\n\nThe announcement follows Oracle's recent shift to the healthcare industry. In 2022, the company bought the medical records company Cerner for about $28 billion.\n\nOther health companies in the Nashville area include HCA, HealthStream, and Change Healthcare. The healthcare companies in the city generate more than $97 billion in revenue, according to the Nashville Health Care Council.\n\nOracle had already announced plans for its $1.2 million office space in Nashville. It will cash in on incentives from the city and state for its expansion, including tax reimbursements and grants. It is set to join other tech giants such as Meta, Apple, and Amazon that have expanded into the Music City.\n\nRead next\n\nWatch: AI has the power to transform everything from workflows to entire companies, but a safe and ethical approach is needed to unlock it\n\nOracle\n\nAdvertisement"
