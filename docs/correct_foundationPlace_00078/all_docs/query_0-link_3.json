        "text": "Continuous adaptation\n\nBy design, d.tech was built to respond to the needs of both students and educators. Amid the pandemic, d.tech reopened its campus, offering a flexible schedule that enabled students to focus on their daily academic and extracurricular priorities.\n\nThe school’s success wouldn’t have been possible without the d.tech faculty, whose relentless optimism and commitment to their students transformed a moment of crisis into an opportunity for growth and learning.\n\nStudents making a difference\n\nA social media alert to help people find COVID-19 vaccine appointments, a tutoring club to help Afghan refugees practice speaking English, an environmental advocacy project showcasing the impact of recycling through a colorful mural—these are just a few of the projects d.tech students are contributing to the world, each one making a positive difference.\n\nIntersession: Learning beyond campus\n\nThe Intersession program is a defining d.tech educational experience. Three times a year, for 60 hours each time, students explore new disciplines and industries through classes offered by nonprofits, businesses, and professionals. Students choose from a wide range of classes such as photography, entomology, cooking, and event venue operations. Every Intersession, Oracle Education Foundation offers classes on technologies such as neural networks, web applications, data science, and more.\n\nOracle Volunteers at d.tech\n\nOracle Volunteers feel at home at d.tech, donating their time and talents to support students year-round. Last year, Oracle Volunteers developed software to improve scheduling for Intersession classes. The application, called Exploration Station, streamlined the student and faculty experience and enabled the program to continue virtually and in person throughout the pandemic."
