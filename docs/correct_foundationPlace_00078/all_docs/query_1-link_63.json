        "text": "What Is Oracle Database?\n\nOracle Database (Oracle DB) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) from Oracle Corporation.\n\nBusinesses require scalable, high-performance databases now more than ever. Many leverage Oracle DB to drive business applications for online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing, and business analytics. IT teams also need on-demand performance from these databases to serve development, testing, analytics, and business-continuity needs.\n\nHow Oracle DB is Faster with All-flash\n\nWe don’t always think about the hardware supporting our database management solutions, but it matters. The more compute and storage resources your RDBMS consumes, the harder it is on your IT infrastructure. If you’re still working with a data lake of spinning disk drives, it’s only a matter of time until you encounter a hardware failure or I/O bottleneck.\n\nFortunately, data storage technology is constantly evolving. NVMe storage is now more affordable and accessible than ever before. Here are some ways NVMe storage solutions can enhance Oracle DB:"
