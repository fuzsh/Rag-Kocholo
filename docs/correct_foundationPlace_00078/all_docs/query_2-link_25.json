        "text": "Oracle Corporation is an American MNC formerly known as Software Development Laboratories (1977–1979), Relational Software Inc. (1979–1982), and Oracle Systems Corporation (1982–1995) headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company deals basically in database software, Cloud computing, a relational database management system. The company was founded by Larry Ellison, Bod Miner, and Ed Oates. In 2019, Oracle was the second-largest software company by revenue and market capitalization.\n\nInitially, in 1977 the company was co-founded by Larry Ellison with Bod Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL) in Santa Clara, California. By 1978 Oracle’s first version 1 was written in assembly language (AL) running on PDP-11 under RSX-11 in 128K of memory. Officially Oracle does not release version 1. In 1979 SDL named itself RSI (Relational System Inc) and moved to Menlo Park, California. The same year oracle released its first Commercial RDBMS.\n\nIn 1982 RSI was renamed Oracle System Corporation under the Vice Presidency of Umang Gupta who wrote the business plan for the company. Oracle was rewritten in C language for portability in 1983 and released as Oracle v3. Soon after in 1984 oracle v4 released with a unique capability of reading consistency. Later in 1987 UNIX-based oracle applications. In 1988 oracle induced PL\\SQL in its v6 with hot backups, embedded PL\\SQL procedural engine, and support for row-level locking. In 1989 oracle relocated its headquarters to Redwood Shores, California.\n\nOracle Products\n\nThe Oracle product comes in a number of flavors:\n\nEnterprise Edition (EE) – The flagship Oracle offering with a vast array of tools and features for the large corporation.\n\nStandard Edition (SE) – Oracle SE contains the basic database management functions for small- and medium-sized shops at a far lower cost than the EE.\n\nStandard Edition One (SEO) – Oracle SEO is specially-priced for single CPU servers used by small businesses.\n\nOracle Express (XE) – Oracle Express contains some DBA features, including basic read-only replication."
