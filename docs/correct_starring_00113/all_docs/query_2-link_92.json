A hell of a career. He was in everything from Silkwood, Short Cuts, and The Right Stuff to Road Trip and Joe Dirt, and great in all of it.\n\nAh, damn. I was pretty sure Remo would dodge death. But if he can’t, no one can.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nI was always disappointed that Remo Williams didn’t catch on. I loved the books when I was in college and he really looked liked the character in the book art as I recall.\n\nLiked him in everything I saw him in. Carry the torch, Jon Bernthal.\n\nHe’s great. Loved him in The Player. Remo Williams was that mid-80s movie HBO had that you couldn’t escape from.\n\nRIP."
