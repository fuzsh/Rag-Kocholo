        "text": "American actor (1942–2022)\n\nFor other people with the same name, see Frederick Ward (disambiguation).\n\nFreddie Joe Ward (December 30, 1942 – May 8, 2022) was an American character actor. Starting with a role in an Italian television movie in 1973, he appeared in such diverse films as Escape from Alcatraz, Southern Comfort, The Right Stuff, Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann, Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, Tremors and Tremors 2: Aftershocks, Henry & June, The Player, Swing Shift, Short Cuts, and 30 Minutes or Less.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nFreddie Joe Ward was born in San Diego on December 30, 1942.[1][2] He was part Cherokee.[3] His father was an alcoholic criminal who was repeatedly imprisoned and his mother left him when Fred was three.[4] He was then raised by his grandmother until his mother had rebuilt her life and remarried a carnival worker.[4] Before acting, Ward spent three years in the United States Air Force. He was also a boxer (breaking his nose three times) and worked as a lumberjack in Alaska,[5][6] a janitor, and a short-order cook. He studied acting at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio after serving in the U.S. Air Force. While living in Rome, he dubbed Italian movies into English and appeared in films by neorealist director Roberto Rossellini.[7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nWard became an actor after studying at Herbert Berghof Studio and in Rome. While in Italy, he worked as a mime. Upon returning stateside in the early 1970s, Ward spent time working in experimental theatre and doing some television work. He made his first American film appearance playing a cowboy in Hearts of the West (1975). His first major role came in the Clint Eastwood vehicle Escape from Alcatraz (1979) as fellow escapee John Anglin.\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nWard played a violent National Guardsman in Walter Hill's Southern Comfort (1981). His first starring role in a motion picture was Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann (1982). He then starred as astronaut Gus Grissom in The Right Stuff, in the action movie Uncommon Valor with Gene Hackman, and in the drama Silkwood (all 1983).\n\nAfter co-starring roles in Swing Shift (1984) and Secret Admirer (1985), Ward played the title hero in the action movie Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, which was directed by Guy Hamilton. The film was supposed to be the first of a series based on The Destroyer series of novels.[8] Though the movie was well promoted and he appeared on several movie magazine covers, it only grossed $15 million.[9]\n\nWard played in a few low-budget productions until he returned to major cinema in 1988 as a cop in Off Limits, as Roone Dimmick in Big Business, and the father of Keanu Reeves' character in The Prince of Pennsylvania.\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, Ward starred as Earl Bassett in the monster movie Tremors, as the American erotic writer Henry Miller in Henry & June (with Uma Thurman), and as cop Hoke Moseley in his self-produced Miami Blues (with Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh). That year he also played an FBI agent in Dennis Hopper's film Catchfire.\n\nAfter playing private detective H.P. Lovecraft in the 1991 HBO film Cast a Deadly Spell alongside Julianne Moore,[10] Ward co-starred in the thriller Thunderheart, the Hollywood satire The Player, the mystery-drama Equinox and the TV western-comedy Four Eyes and Six Guns, for which he won a Cable ACE Award. He also did a cameo in Bob Roberts, starring Tim Robbins.\n\nWard's leading roles include Lt. Brann in the two-character-thriller Two Small Bodies, fisherman Stuart Kane in the Robert Altman film Short Cuts (for which the whole ensemble won a Golden Globe; both 1993), a dangerous criminal in the comedy Naked Gun 33+1⁄3: The Final Insult (1994), the sailor in the French-avant-garde-drama The Blue Villa (1995), his reprised role in Tremors II: Aftershocks and the special agent in Chain Reaction (both 1996). He also appeared as Sheriff Bud Phillips in Best Men, as Dave Reimüller in ...First Do No Harm with Meryl Streep (both 1997) and as Domenico Venier in Dangerous Beauty (1998).\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nWard was seen in many motion pictures, TV shows and videos in 2000. He starred in the action-thriller The Chaos Factor and appeared in the gangster movie Circus, the teen movie Road Trip and the horror sequel The Crow: Salvation.\n\nIn 2001, Ward was nominated for a Video Premiere Award as the best male actor for the direct-to-video-production Full Disclosure. He also co-starred in Joe Dirt, Summer Catch, Wild Iris, the mini-TV-series Dice and the comedic Corky Romano.\n\nIn 2002, Ward appeared in Sweet Home Alabama, Enough and Abandon. He had the starring role in Birdseye and signed in for the TV pilot for the drama Georgetown with Helen Mirren, but the series was never made. After roles in The Last Ride, 10.5 and Coast to Coast (all 2004) he took a short break from acting and returned as a guest in the TV series Grey's Anatomy and ER (2006 and 2007). He was next in the ensemble drama Feast of Love, the thriller Exit Speed, Management with Jennifer Aniston, The Wild Stallion DVD and as the boss Ashcroft in Armored.\n\nWard guest starred as Ronald Reagan in the French political thriller L'affaire Farewell (2009). He appeared in 30 Minutes or Less, guest starred in the TV series United States of Tara, In Plain Sight and Leverage in 2012. In 2013, he had a guest role in 2 Guns starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWard married Marie-France Boisselle in 1995. They resided in Los Angeles. He had one son, Django Ward, a singer and guitarist, from his previous marriage to Silvia Ward.\n\nWard and his wife Marie-France both filed for divorce in August 2013,[11] but they reconciled later that year.[12]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nWard died on May 8, 2022 at the age of 79.[4][13][14][15]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\n1993: Special Volpi Cup – Short Cuts (recipient)\n\n1993: Golden Globe Special Ensemble Cast Award – Short Cuts (recipient)\n\n1994: CableACE Award – Four Eyes and Six Guns (nominated)\n\n2001: Video Premiere Award – Full Disclosure (nominated)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1973 The Age of the Medici (L'età di Cosimo de Medici) Niccolò de' Conti Episode: \"The Power of Cosimo\" (\"Il potere di Cosimo\") 1974 Cartesius Unknown TV movie Ginger in the Morning Truck Driver 1975 Hearts of the West Sam Uncredited[4] 1978 Quincy, M.E.
