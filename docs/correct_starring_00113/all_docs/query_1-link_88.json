        "text": "The devastating death of Fred Ward on May 8, 2022, was tragic news for fans of the 79-year-old star's work. Ward had no shortage of serious actor accolades and acting credits, including a notable final role in his lengthy résumé.\n\nThe actor’s last movie appearance was in the 2013 buddy cop movie \"2 Guns,\" where he starred opposite Hollywood A-listers Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Ward plays Rear Admiral Tuwey in this story about a mission to retrieve a narcotics shipment from a major drug lord.\n\n“2 Guns\" is a light-hearted buddy cop comedy with a 65 percent critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film co-stars James Marsden, Bill Paxton, Paula Patton, and Edward James Olmos, making it clear that Ward ended his big-screen career on a pretty cool note."
