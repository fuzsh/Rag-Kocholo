        "text": "Greetings all and sundry!\n\nWith a New Year just making itself known with surprisingly dense fog, unseasonably cold wind and weather rattling panes of glass. I’ve taken to curling up in a favorite leather chair, Beverage close at hand and delving into some ideas and topics that have been seeking sunlight in my gray matter. With a steadily occupied, though unsung purveyor of his chosen raft, trade and art. Making consistently small ripples in films that when first released fared less well than expected, Though, with the passage of time. Have become minor classics. Several of which fall into the realm of what I call “Guy Films”. While all of my selections fall into:\n\nTwo Favorite Things!: Ensemble Acting & Fred Ward\n\nFirst seen as one of a group of cell block mates who befriend Clint Eastwood’s Frank Morris in Don Siegel’s Escape From Alcatraz from 1979. There was something about his elder Anglin brother’s slovenliness and gruff, straightforward delivery that raised my eyebrow. An undercurrent of patience while being coiled tight as a spring inside. That made him a decent foil for Mr. Eastwood as the plot slowly unfolds amongst the Cat & Mouse games played with the prissy, fastidious Warden, Patrick McGoohan. Mr. Ward is but a small cog in a larger vehicle of “Men Behind Bars” entertainment. Making his actions and words memorable amongst a large and diverse cast.\n\nMaking him a third or fourth choice of Walter Hill two years later. In the culture clashing, Testosterone laden, lost in the Louisiana swamps gem, Southern Comfort. Playing Corporal Lonnie Reece. One of nine men sent out on an Army National Guard weekend Maps and Orientation exercise that starts to go wrong very early on. And only get worse as they wander deeper into the foggy, damp and miserable swamps. Not high enough on the Chain of Command for his often cautionary words to betaken seriously. Opposite Keith Carradine and Powers Boothe. Who are in charge and deeply enmeshed in their own personal pissing contest.\n\nCreating a sometimes fairly accurate look at the foibles and responsibilities of running a cohesive squad as little “sickening factors” like bad weather and loss of communications make themselves known. And add to the tension and pressures of less than friendly contact with those who hunt, fish, live and thrive in a six or seven map grid coordinates of the assigned “exercise area”. Making Mr. Ward a larger part of a smaller film where mystery and suspense play heavily. And brings about an ending no one really sees coming!\n\nWhich brings us to a minor Docu~Dramatic marvel helmed by Phillip Kaufman and adapted from Tom Wolfe’s best-selling tale.\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\n\nA criminally neglected, caught between cinematic technologies offering that stylishly chronicles the evolution of “The Space Race” and its knights in shining armor. The Mercury Astronauts. From the very late 1950s and its quiet, though incredibly gifted and ballsy, Captain Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard. Rarely more soft-spoken or better!) breaking the sound barrier in the tiny Bell X-1 aircraft above what would later be Edwards Air Force Base. To Russia and its ground breaking Sputnik satellite and first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin. Who put a face to the coming political, economic and technological war to come.\n\nThe balloon goes up and volunteers are sought from the military ranks. Pilots, of course. Though engineers would have equal footing later on. All ramrodded by a sadly caricatured LBJ. Air Speed Record setters like Marne pilot, John Glenn (Ed Harris). Hot Naval Aviator, Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), Air Force Korean War Ace, Gus Grissom (Mr. Ward). Test pilot, Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid), Numbers cruncher, Wally Schirra (Lance Henricksen) and Deke Slayton (Scott Paulin).\n\nBrought together and quickly made famous through a lucrative ad campaign, cutesy of Life magazine. While enduring physical, mental and psych evaluations that would weld this group contained egos against the starched, silent, efficient tyrant, Nurse Murch (Absolutely perfect, Jane Dornacker!) of New Mexico’s Holliman Aeronautic Medical facility.\n\nAllowing director, Kaufman to construct a tale that doesn’t deviate much from what I remember of that halcyon era of my young life. With a superb cast of hungry talent being close to dead ringers for those being portrayed, Especially Mr. Ward and his lantern-jawed perpetual “five o’clock shadow. Ed Harris’ too close to perfect “Clean Marine”, John Glenn. Scott Glenn’s spot on Naval fighter jock, Al Shepard. And Dennis Quaid’s prankster kid brother, Gordon Cooper.\n\nLeading the charge on their own egos and volition at first. Then becoming a cohesive unit in the locker room, “Man versus Monkey” debate. With Mr. Ward’s gruff Gus changing the discussion from questionable late night activities to the elephant in the room. What goes up first, trained pilots or smaller, more expendable chimps? It’s an excellent example of logical layered dialogue. Waylaid by Gus, but added onto by all seven astronauts deciphering “What Gus is trying to say.”\n\nThen later bringing the fruits of their debate to life. With major changes to nomenclature, job descriptions, functions, abilities and related buzz words as the first prototype “Capsule” is rolled out for inspection. Kicked off by Gus and his initial “Where’s the window?” before Dr. Von Braun and a clutch of “Our German scientists”. As Cooper, Glenn and Shepard steer and manipulate important concessions to their liking with their deal breaking, “No bucks. No Buck Rogers!” As a small pond of photographers and reporters wait impatiently just inside the hangar and out of ear shot.\n\nTwo fine examples of the ensemble art in a film filled with many more. Most noticeably amongst the men, but the wives also have their times to shine! Early in the film with their “Maintaining an even strain” tea party at Muroc. Led by Trudy Cooper (Pamela Reed) and Betty Cooper (Veronica Cartwright). Their later acceptance of stuttering Annie Glenn (Mary Jo Deschanel). And the “impromptu” discussion of Gordo Cooper’s future between Trudy and Nurse Burch. Heard only in muffled whispers by Gordo fidgeting in the waiting room outside. Though it is Barbara Hershey who rules and delivers in wondrous ways as Glennis Yeager! Mixing sensuality and a deep vein of concern. With the ability to elegantly, effortlessly keep her risk taking husband in line.\n\nNow. What Makes his Film Good?\n\nA very little messed with screenplay by director, Kaufman. Taken from Mr. Wolfe’s tome. Whose first inkling were hinted at with the author’s original tale, The Truest Sport: Jousting with and Sam and Charlie. And what is the natural progression of a Navy or Marine Aviator? Mr. Wolfe plunges deep and reveals the intricacies and fraternity of those first men shot into ballistic trajectory. And later earth orbits.\n\nFrom its hard scrabble beginnings at Muroc and later, Edwards Air Force Base. To Holliman and Cape Canaveral. The attention to detail is exquisite. As are the dialogue and exceptional Old School model work in the development of the Bell X-1 and later versions. And the friendly competition between Major Yeager and Chris Crossfield (Scott Wilson) as to who is the faster man on earth.\n\nCinematography by Caleb Deschanel captures the dusty griminess of the desert around Pancho Barnes’ local watering hole and steak house. Shifts gears to glimpses of the splendor that resides in the very thin envelope between sky and space. To the shiny sterility of laboratories,science and technology as the Mercury project swings into full gear.\n\nHighest marks for Editing by Glenn Farr. Most notably in keeping scenes just as long as they have to be. While juggling split seconds of finely meshed model effects that surpass whatever much more expensive computer constructs were available a the time!\n\nArt Direction from W. Stuart Campbell. And shifting style Set Decoration by George R. Nelson. Music and sound track by Bill Conti is sporadically of its time. When not showing off a veteran’s touch with brass and wind heavy full orchestration.\n\nWhat Makes This Film Great?\n\nHaving the time, patience and wherewithal to assemble a proper cast. Avail them of some of the best dialogue of the 1980s. More than a thumbnail sketch of the characters each would portray. And allow them the opportunities for best efforts. Letting the chemistry come along naturally. Especially where male egos are concerned. While the wives form their own support committees for their husbands, And themselves. Delivering an unvarnished look at what it takes to be “Mrs. (Insert Rank and Last Name Here)”. The wife of a fighter. And adding to the “strain”; experimental pilot. Very heady and near taboo stuff for the early 1960s!"
