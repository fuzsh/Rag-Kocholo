        "text": "Education today is too Type X- meaning the emphasis on greater rewards for doing what you should do anyways is based on extrinsic rewards. The education system seems to be heavily based on carrots and sticks. The biggest way to motivate someone seems to be by dangling something, such as a carrot, in front of someone 's face or poking them with a stick. If you want a student to do something, why are they motivated with some type of compensation such as an A in the class? In his book, Drive, Daniel H. Pink divides motivation into three categories that evolved over time- Motivation 1.0, 2.0, 3.0. using these theories to challenge this motivation of carrot and sticks.\n\nIn chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Author Daniel Pink introduces two types of motivators that he refers to as, “Human operating systems”. Times have changed, and business models are changing as well. Just like we need to upgrade our computer software when it begins to fail. We also need to upgrade our human operating systems, when our current method is not keeping up with the ever-changing business world. The concept of reward and punishment to encourage employees to be more productive is an outdated way of managing people. In order to create a better work environment and increase productivity, we need to upgrade our idea of motivation to include autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nAfter read the Drive, the surprising Truth about What Motivates Us which wrote by Daniel H. Pink, it making me rethinking a lot of how the way I understand the world. The topic in this book is kind like renew people’s opinion about how will the money motivation’s way works in the future, through Daniel Pink’s novelty idea which are breaking the traditional common sense. However, I personally think that the book's reading value is not high for people who are working at the level of management or higher position, they cannot exactly get a good idea of how to motivate employees from this book.\n\nIntrinsic motivation is gaining more recognition in the workplace. Books like Driven by Daniel Pink talk about the scientific data that supports the notion that humans are not wired to be rewarded with more money, but instead a sense of purpose. The connection between intrinsic motivation and working independently is that by working in a team there is less individual contribution, therefore limiting the sense of ownership in a project. When a person works independently they set their own goals and deadlines (Halvorson) while forced to comprehend the task at hand clearer. The quality of the work is higher in part because the success of the work is left entirely on one person, but also because individuals find reasons to remain motivated and\n\nPink's take on self-determination theory and its affects on motivation are very captivating. We usually acknowledge only two drives that inspire action with the first being biological drive, which is intrinsic. The second drive, which has more to do with the business workplace than the biological drive, being material incentives, things such as salary and punishment; extrinsic motivators. Under this perception, work is considered agony and careful structures of incentives and disincentives are needed to control employee sluggishness. What Pink discusses in this book is that there is evidence of that third drive Harlow found during his research.\n\nI plan to use my engineering knowledge with one of the major car companies and work to improve the safety of vehicles. Having been employed in manual labor, I know that there is an immense need for labor everywhere. Moreover, this labor does not require any significant mental capacity. Working at Teague was benefiting the company, but I did not feel like I was doing something impactful with my work. I was profiting the company but not fulfilling any of my dreams or aspirations. Recently, I read the book Drive by Daniel Pink. The novel explains that each human has three primary methods of motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. These are the three things I am searching for in a company. Autonomy, the ability to have some level of independence\n\nMotivation 2.0 is not working anymore because it does not combine with new businesses. Pink is showing how motivation 2.0 doesn’t work and arguing that we need to move to motivation 3.0. Motivation 2.0 responds to rewards and punishments (carrots and sticks). It is not compatible with how the businesses are organized on what we do, what we think and also what we do. Motivation 3.0 is where humans have to try to learn to be creative and to better the world. The external rewards and punishments are not working for heuristics, but are for algorithmic. To be able to solve any problems you need to depend on the intrinsic motivation is creativity.\n\nWhile watching “The Puzzle of Motivation” by Dan Pink, I was very intrigued. Throughout the entire talk, there were several interesting points that were made. It really interested me when Pink talked about the group that was rewarded. Pink stated that if the contestants were in the top 25% of the fastest times, they would be rewarded five dollars. With this incentive, most would hope to do well, if not better than the person that would not be rewarded. Pink then goes on to point out the results. How much faster did the group that was offered a reward actually do? On average, it took them three and a half minutes longer. This really stood out to me because when offered a reward for a task, normally a person would be more motivated and thus do better. What amazed me even more was that this isn’t just a one time thing. This is has been replicated over and over for nearly 40 years. As Pink says around 04:33, “These contingent motivators -- if you do this, then you get that -- work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don 't work or, often, they do harm.” These rewards that are being offered are being used to attempt to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, but instead it’s proving to do the opposite. It’s proving to dull thinking and block creativity.\n\nMotivation can be defined as the desire or inspiration to carry out specific tasks or to do something. Motivation is required when goals are being set and more so in their execution. In a work setting, motivation can be defined as a process through which individuals choose between alternative forms of behavior with the aim of achieving personal objectives. The goals sought by individuals can be extrinsic or relatively tangible such as monetary rewards and promotion, or intrinsic or intangible such as self esteem or job satisfaction (Armstrong, 2006). In learning, the desire to attain good grades is what motivates a student to study hard everyday as they prepare for the exam. On the other hand, for a teacher to put his best foot forward, he\n\nDuring the summer in June I finally went to worlds of fun. The trip there felt like the longest ride ever. We had five people in the car for three hours and it was June so it was a very hot day the day we drove up there. It was around 98 degrees outside and five people scrunched up in a car was bad. I could feel like droplets of sweat come from my head and drip down my face. I smelled the sweat in the car which just covered the entire car with funk. The windows in the car was rolled up and the A/C was on, and everyone was getting cranky. I could hear everyone in the car tossing back and forth trying to get comfortable but no one could. It was about as tight as a can of sardines.\n\nA theory that supports motivation is the self determination theory. In the self determination theory people need to grow and gain fulfillment by a drive in them. Self Determination is the process of deciding how to act on ones environment. When one is trying to overcome a challenge or encountering a new experience a person wants to gain the knowledge to succeed over the new challenge. When self determination theory is in focus internal factors are at play; a person is primarily focused on the need to gain knowledge or independence. There are three factors that contribute to a student’s self determination and the needs are linked to the student’s\n\nDaniel Pink makes a solid, science built point regarding motivation 3.0 in his book “Drive”. For the 21st century we are in need of more people that allow themselves to have autonomy, purpose and mastery in their life to become successful and achieve happiness in their careers. Able to look at my future career as a specialist instructor/teacher in a different point of view. After reading every chapter I was able to see how I can apply some of these methods to achieve my goals and also be happy in my career. Most of us look at our future and think we need to pick a career that can offer us a 6 digit yearly income, without realizing if that career will bring us happiness. Drive was able to make me realize when looking at my future career I"
