        "text": "The post-Second World War economic growth of the western countries was much faster than the prewar growth rates. The credit for this goes to the technologies invented during the war and after it. The introduction of new technologies to the traditional economic sectors changed several aspects of the businesses and the market dynamics. Especially, in the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century this transition of technology-related and technology-driven economic sectors started to dominate for the first time. However, there was no proper model or framework of these changing business landscapes. The academicians provided several theories and models to streamline the emerging businesses where machines started playing important roles and the manpower needed a lot of skills and practices to keep the businesses competitive. In those changing business scenarios, employee motivation was found to be an important aspect of strategic management. Several models of motivation were proposed by the economists and psychologists of the time. Motivation used to be regarded as the key for productivity and quality. The genesis of Porter and Lawler's model is very much related to that thought of cause and effect of industrial productivity. Porter and Lawler used the expectancy theory provided in Vroom (1964) to frame a process-based model. In fact, their model is an extension of Vroom's expectancy theory. They considered productivity as a function of the expectations of the employees and they are directly related (Porter and Lawler, 1968). Their work gave the perception that in order to enhance their productivity, companies have to satisfy the employees through appropriate rewards and remunerations. They classify those rewards and remunerations to intrinsic and extrinsic forms. Intrinsic rewards are the feel-good factors, reputation and the stature given by the employer for the achievement. Whereas the extrinsic ones are the increment in the salary, perks and the promotion in recognition of the deeds.\n\nThis study adopts a qualitative method of data collection. Our argument is on the important role non-financial rewards play on a motivated workforce. The obtained data was from secondary sources viz, books, journals, newsletters, magazines, term papers, and etcetera. Abraham Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs, guided this study. We understand that, humans as emotional beings are motivated by several factors. What may motivate one may demotivate another. From this study, the following findings where obtained: that there are other factors aside financial rewards that motivates employees in the organization. Some of these factors include, flexible work, summer hours, giving birthday off, once in a while giving of meals, snacks and treats, financial wellbeing support, discounts on commonly used essentials and etcetera. Submissively, for employers, management, organizations and government to get the best from employees vis-avis job performance, subsidies on transportation should be made available, and the need for a flexible working hours should be considered, especially for employees whose work are way far from home.\n\nMotivation is the “psychological forces that determine the direction of a person’s behavior in an organization, a person’s level of effort, and a person’s level of persistence in the face of obstacles.” The inclusion of the word ‘forces’ as used above, explains how motivation can have either a ‘pull’ or ‘push’ effect. This would mean that motivation is aimed at gaining the trust of the employee so that he/she in turn would be willing to positively affect the growth and success of the Organization. Managers achieve this differently, depending on the best win-win factor(s) at their disposal; such as offering the employee an acceptable monetary offer. An employee may be motivated by the desire to acquire more money to meet up some social obligations such as having an expensive wedding celebration for instance. This can make him take on extra job or be willing to work ‘overtime’. The desire to earn job promotion can also be a determining factor for some employees to wish to study for a higher degree or belong to accrediting professional associations, and take professional exams. It is possible for an employee to demonstrate greater organizational commitment and overall productivity when motivated. Research has proved that motivation can increase productivity/bottom line. There are also issues that arises due to lack of motivation – some of which are mostly borne by the employee such as employee ‘burnout.’ Will employers continually seek avenues to engage their workers in the most positive motivating manner into the next millennium? There is a growing tendency that suitable employees will outmatch available job positions – will this not lead employers to play down the demands for employee motivation? If this happens, will there still be needs for more research on motivation models? With increasing technology in communication and more employees deciding to work from home, especially in social marketing networks – will there not be low demand for job seekers? There is the likelihood that more and more employees would experience burnout as they try to overwork themselves in trying to keep their job in a highly job-seeking competitive environment. The future of employee motivation is full of grey areas requiring more research insights.\n\nMotivation is the moving factor and the reason for carrying out the defined activities, the personal development, the realization of the work process. To make one decision the individual chooses between two or more options, depending on the desire for the final result and the achievement of the set goals. The motivation for labor is conscious and/or unconscious depending on the received satisfaction and willingness to achieve definite and benefits. At the beginning of his career, every employee is confronted with the dilemma of whether the choice of work is appropriate, whether he is prepared to perform the assigned tasks, whether he is ready for the responsibilities that accompany the work process. Effective staff management depends to a large extent on how to steer people in a particular direction and what steps to take to motivate them to reach their horizons, which implies the propulsion of populations of value Landmarks, human energy from positive impulses or building a complete system of business projects to achieve personal goals, a sense of common purpose and strategy. Theoretical-the applied dimensions of motivation most often bring to the fore: The potential of the person (or group) and the strength of their motivation. This dependence means that the lack of quality training and the ability to carry out an activity cannot be replaced by the highest degree of motivation to obtain positive results. Knowing the theories of labour motivation can give confidence to workers and their managers about the implementation of activities and tasks based on thought or physical processes. Motivation for work and fulfillment of the assigned tasks is the driving force for the development of the society, for the development of the economy, for the development of science."
