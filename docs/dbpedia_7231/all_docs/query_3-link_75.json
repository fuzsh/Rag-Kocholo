        "text": "THINK PINK: Daniel H. Pink enters the extended hardcover nonfiction list at No. 16 with “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.” Pink (inset) achieved full guru status with “A Whole New Mind” (2005), a paean to right-brain thinking that spent more than 29 weeks on the paper­back nonfiction list, thanks in part to a nod from Oprah Winfrey. (She distributed copies to Stanford’s graduating class after her 2008 commencement speech.) In “The Adventures of Johnny Bunko” (2008), billed as “America’s first business book in the Japanese comic format known as manga,” Pink reached out to the youth crowd with the story of a frustrated desk monkey who conjures up a tough-talking career counselor goddess by snapping open a pair of magic chopsticks.\n\nIn “A Whole New Mind,” Pink’s mantra was “abundance, Asia and automation.” In “Drive,” it’s “autonomy, mastery and purpose.” Winfrey, he writes, is a Type I personality, motivated by intrinsic rewards rather than the money and approval that so-called Type X’s chase after. And you can be one too! Easy first steps include throwing away your “cookie-cutter” fitness regime, making your own personal motivation poster (kittens optional) and giving yourself regular performance reviews. Pink also extracts lessons from books like Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals” (Lincoln: totally Type I) and Joshua Ferris’s dark office novel “Then We Came to the End,” which is not, it turns out, a satire of Pink-like thinking but “a cautionary tale for the demoralizing effects of the Type X workplace.”\n\nGET HAPPY: Pink offers an enthusiastic blurb for Gretchen Rubin’s “Happiness Project,” which enters the hardcover how-to and advice list at No. 2. The book derives from Rubin’s long-running blog, which once offered some useful advice on how to read more, beginning with this paradoxical tip: “Quit Reading. I used to pride myself on finishing every book I started. No more. Life is short.”\n\nHER WAY: Zadie Smith, whose essay collection “Changing My Mind” is reviewed on Page 11 this week, recently confessed to NPR that she doesn’t write every day: “I wish I did more than anything, and I wish I had the compulsion. But in my defense, I think that novels should feel very necessary to the people who write them. I just realized quite early on that I’m not going to be the type who can write a novel every two years. I think you need to feel an urgency about the act. Otherwise, when you read it, you feel no urgency, either. So I don’t write unless I really feel I need to, and that’s a luxury.”\n\nFICTION FOLLIES: There’s a sudden flood of new titles on the fiction list, all from hardened best-seller writers. Julie Garwood’s “Sizzle,” Jayne Anne Krentz’s “Fired Up” and Jude Deveraux’s “Days of Gold” scratch the romance itch. More action-oriented types can take comfort in Stephen Hunter’s “I, Sniper,” Tami Hoag’s “Deeper Than Dead” and James Rollins’s “Altar of Eden.” Jennifer Schuessler"
