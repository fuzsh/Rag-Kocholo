Our goal wasn't to write a long synopsis that you'd have to slog through. The idea is to save you time.\n\nIf you like our super concise and entertaining summaries, please give us a good review!\n\n\"The 5 Minute Book Summaries\" is part of the ReadSmartly series. Our motto is \"Read Less, Know More!\"\n\nWe only cover authors we admire, so if you like the summary, we encourage you to delve deeper and buy the full book."
