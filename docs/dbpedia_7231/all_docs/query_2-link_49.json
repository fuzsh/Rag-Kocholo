Words of wisdom may be just the thing you need to boost your confidence, shift your 9-to-5 mindset, and motivate you. Does your workload also have you feeling like you don’t have any time to read? Have you blown through your Daily Wellness playlist and all the motivational podcasts? Tune into an audiobook.\n\nFeaturing titles from Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, Jenn Lim, Ben McKenzie, and Gary Vaynerchuk, these 12 motivational audiobooks range from blueprints for success to tales about the inner workings of the business world. So find a selection that inspires you and start listening on Spotify.\n\nBeyond Happiness: How Authentic Leaders Prioritize Purpose and People for Growth and Impact\n\nWritten and narrated by Jenn Lim\n\nThe cofounder and CEO of Delivering Happiness updates its namesake model with the aim of showing organizations of every kind how to cultivate a culture that can adapt to change, be highly profitable, and support all its people.\n\nOver the course of Beyond Happiness, author Jenn Lim sets out to show how bringing your whole self to work allows you to do your best work every day, no matter what role you play at your company, or what crisis might come at you next. Making the argument that true happiness comes from living your true purpose, Lim points to case studies that show how companies can help individuals align their purpose with the company mission.\n\nEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud\n\nWritten by Ben McKenzie and Jacob Silverman\n\nNarrated By Ben McKenzie\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, TV star Ben McKenzie says he was the perfect mark for cryptocurrency: a dad stuck at home with some cash in his pocket, worried about his family, armed with only the vague notion that people were making heaps of money on something he—despite having a degree in economics—didn’t entirely understand. Lured in by the promise of taking power from banks, possibly improving democracy, and a touch of FOMO, McKenzie dove deep into blockchain, Bitcoin, and the rest of the cryptocurrency world.\n\nBut after scratching the surface, he started to question if it was all a scam. In Easy Money, McKenzie enlists the help of journalist Jacob Silverman for a caper and exposé that points to what he says are the climactic final days of cryptocurrency now upon us. Weaving together stories of average traders and victims, colorful crypto “visionaries,” Hollywood’s biggest true believers, anti-crypto whistleblowers, and government agents searching for solutions at the precipice of a major crash, Easy Money delivers an on-the-ground look into cryptocurrencies’ inner workings.\n\nThe 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure\n\nWritten and narrated by Grant Cardone\n\nIn the eyes of author Grant Cardone, extreme success lies beyond the realm of normal action. He believes it requires breaking from the status quo and removing luck and chance from the business equation. And with The 10X Rule, he wants to show you how.\n\nWith step-by-step guidance on how to achieve phenomenal success, this audiobook explains the amount of effort needed to achieve and sustain success. Cardone says that four degrees of action exist, and in order to achieve your dreams, you must learn to operate at the fourth degree of action: massive action. The 10X Rule aims to help you dissolve fear, increase your belief in yourself, eliminate procrastination, and provide you with an overwhelming sense of purpose.\n\nRest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less\n\nWritten by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang\n\nNarrated by Alex Sims\n\nOverwork is the new normal. Rest is something to do when the important things are done, but it seems like they are never done. Looking at different forms of rest, from sleep to vacation, Silicon Valley futurist and business consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang dispels the myth that the harder we work the better the outcome.\n\nCombining rigorous scientific research with a rich array of examples of writers, painters, and thinkers—from Darwin to Stephen King—Rest challenges our tendency to see work and relaxation as antithetical. “Deliberate rest,” as Pang calls it, is the true key to productivity and will give us more energy, sharper ideas, and a better life. This audiobook offers a roadmap to rediscovering the importance of rest in our lives, and a convincing argument that we need to relax more if we actually want to get more done.\n\nReset: Powerful Habits to Own Your Thoughts, Understand Your Feelings, and Change Your Life\n\nWritten by Debra Fileta and Christine Caine\n\nNarrated by Debra Fileta\n\nWant to break free from unhealthy habits and replace them with positive patterns?

It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Newport says deep work can make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship.\n\nInstead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four “rules,” for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.\n\nA mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes listeners on a journey through memorable stories, ranging from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business-class ticket to Tokyo to work on a book from the air. For anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world, this is a must-listen audiobook for a motivated workday."
