        "text": "«Drive» is a book by American psychologist Daniel Pink, which was first published in 2009. In it, the author explores what motivates people at work and in life. Pink argues that traditional motivation methods based on rewards and punishments are not effective in the long term. Instead, he proposes three \"inner motivators\": autonomy — the need to take control of one's own life; mastery — the desire to become better at what you do; purpose — the need to feel that your work has meaning and makes a difference in the world. The psychologist argues that when people feel motivated by these internal factors, they are more productive, creative, and satisfied with their work.\n\n«Drive» has become a bestseller and has been translated into many languages. It is praised for its clear presentation of scientific research and practical advice on how to create a more motivating work and life environment.\n\nFor the Ukrainian language, just as for the book, there should be no borders. We offer a wide selection of quality literature in the USA and Canada. Our goal is to provide readers with the opportunity to enjoy their favorite works in Ukrainian, promote the craftsmanship of Ukrainian authors, and the quality of Ukrainian publishing beyond the borders of the Country that changes the world."
