        "text": "An idea worth spreading\n\nMotivating is a critical aspect of leadership in any field, but especially important in health care. Health care is delivered in teams, and most of the time, the individuals on the team report to different people. Traditional rewards (or punishments) are often unavailable (and probably ineffective at changing long-term behavior). The skills of influencing and motivating are key to building and nurturing a great team."
