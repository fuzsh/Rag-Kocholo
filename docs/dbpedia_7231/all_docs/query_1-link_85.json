Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.\n\nDrawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâand how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:\n\n*Autonomyâthe desire to direct our own lives\n\n*Masteryâthe urge to get better and better at something that matters\n\n*Purposeâthe yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves\n\nAlong the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.\n\nDrive is bursting with big ideasâthe rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live."
