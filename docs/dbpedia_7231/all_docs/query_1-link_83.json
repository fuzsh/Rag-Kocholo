        "text": "Synopsis of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\n\nBy Daniel H. Pink\n\nChapter 2: Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work...\n\nOvercome \"functional fixedness\" — seeing something as having only one function [page 41]\n\nGoals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased intrinsic motivation. Use care when applying goals in your organization [page 50].\n\nThe very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short-term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long-term effects on the organization [page 56].\n\nLikewise, several studies show that paying people to exercise, stop smoking, or take their medicines produces terrific results at first — but the health behavior disappears once the incentives are removed. However, when contingent rewards aren't involved, or when incentives are used with the proper deftness, performance improves and understanding deepens [page 57].\n\nChapter 2a: ...and the Special Circumstances When They Do\n\nAny extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete. Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project — and offering it as a contingency — will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem [page 64].\n\nChapter 3: Type I and Type X\n\nWe have three innate psychological needs — competence, autonomy, and relatedness [page 70].\n\nChapter 4: Autonomy\n\nManagement isn't about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It's about creating conditions for people to do their best work [page 84].\n\nHire good people and leave them alone [page 93].\n\n\"homeshoring\" (working from home) [page 101]\n\n\"Anybody who wants to rise in the ranks and lead a team must assemble people willing to work with them.\" [page 103]\n\n\"We're born to be players, not pawns. We're meant to be autonomous individuals, not individual automatons.\" [page 106]\n\nType I for Individuals: Nine Strategies for Awakening Your Motivation\n\nWhat's your sentence? [pages 154-155] For example, Abraham Lincoln's is \"He preserved the union and freed the slaves.\" Franklin Roosevelt's was \"He lifted us out of a Great Depression and helped us win a world war.\"\n\nType I for Organizations: Thirteen Ways to Improve Your Company, Office, or Group\n\nConduct an autonomy audit [page 166].\n\n...anybody at any time can award a colleague a fifty-dollar bonus [page 169].\n\nPlay \"Whose purpose is it anyway?\" [page 171] Ask each person to write down his or her one-sentence answer to the following question: âWhat is our companyâs (or organizationâs) purpose?â Collect the cards and read them aloud. What do they tell you? Are the answers similar, everyone aligned along a common purpose?\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nRSA version of Drive:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&feature=youtu.be"
