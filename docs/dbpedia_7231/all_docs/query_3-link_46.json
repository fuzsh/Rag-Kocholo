        "text": "In the book Drive by Daniel H Pink he talks about various things that could come in handy. Pink talks about how people should change to Motivation 3.0 and leave behind Motivation 2.0.Motivation 3.0 is for someone to continue with their life and have a better future with doing things that you love and would want to do for your rest of your life. Which Motivation also talks about Type X behavior which leads to three types of behavior autonomy mastery and purpose, this explains how people use them to become someone better in their life and show us how that involves with Motivation 3.0. This is something I keep in consideration, that’s why I consider myself in having a Type I behavior that can lead as well with Motivation 3.0.\n\nIn the introduction and chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Daniel H. Pink expressed how behavioral science can change the common understanding of people’s driving force and suggests a more helpful way to better performance. Pink mentioned that there are two main drives that are powered by behavior. First is the biological drive which comes from within individuals and the second drive comes from without rewards and punishments the environment provides for performing in particular ways. However, a scientist named Harry F. Harlow came up with a third drive after experimenting with monkeys and Harlow called it the “intrinsic motivation.” Harlow said that to completely comprehend the human condition, people have\n\nRyan, R. M. and Deci, E. L. (2000) in their studies of motivation claim that motivation is dependent on multiple different factors and is valued because of its consequences. They believe that people can either be motivated by an external coercion (extrinsic motivation) or simply because of their internal interest in an activity that urges their actions- intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is the natural tendency of people to seek out answers to phenomena and it is the inherent propensity that people have to take actions. The importance of intrinsic motivation is to the point that this essay will be mainly focusing on this subject along with the ample of practical examples that have been seen in the “Eddie, The Eagle”\n\nWhile watching “The Puzzle of Motivation” by Dan Pink, I was very intrigued. Throughout the entire talk, there were several interesting points that were made. It really interested me when Pink talked about the group that was rewarded. Pink stated that if the contestants were in the top 25% of the fastest times, they would be rewarded five dollars. With this incentive, most would hope to do well, if not better than the person that would not be rewarded. Pink then goes on to point out the results. How much faster did the group that was offered a reward actually do? On average, it took them three and a half minutes longer. This really stood out to me because when offered a reward for a task, normally a person would be more motivated and thus do better. What amazed me even more was that this isn’t just a one time thing. This is has been replicated over and over for nearly 40 years. As Pink says around 04:33, “These contingent motivators -- if you do this, then you get that -- work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don 't work or, often, they do harm.” These rewards that are being offered are being used to attempt to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, but instead it’s proving to do the opposite. It’s proving to dull thinking and block creativity.\n\nRing Ring.Ring Ring. I awoke from my nap.Being Mayor of Fakersville isn't Easy.Creak.The Oldest door in the oldest building in the town Made that sound Every Time it Opened. “Mr Wilson,Someone is Calling You.” That is My secretary Jade. She is a little off. Something is just wrong with her.Something is Wrong with this whole town. It just isint normal.As I slowly pick up the phone wondering what incident happened now This Is the voice I hear. “Mr.Wilson,We need you down here right now boss.” “What happened Steven?” “Just Get down To Highway 92.” Steven is are Chief of A police. He’s not really good but he is the only one I got.But anyways let’s get back to the story.Great I thought. Another accident to make this town look\n\nAlthough intrinsic motivation has numerous benefits, few drawbacks of intrinsic motivation should also be considered as well. An intense form of intrinsic motivation can reach to the point that employees can completely lose track of time and space, completely ignore authority and other important tasks, as well as not having enough time to learn or perform other essential tasks while learning and enjoying a particular academic activity. When performing an enjoyable task, a person can lose track of space or self-awareness. Individuals motivated by intrinsic gratification seek an experience for itself, rather than for anticipated rewards. The process is considerably more important to them than the resulting product or outcome, which has them working often\n\nMotivation is the force that makes us do things, whether accomplishing personal goals or completing tasks at work. Most people are motivated as a result of their individual needs being satisfied, which gives them the inspiration to perform specific behaviors for which they receive rewards (Kinicki & Williams, 2011). These needs vary from person to person, as everybody has specific needs to be satisfied. When we consider factors that determine the motivation of employees, many of us think of a high salary. This answer is correct for the reason that some employees will be motivated by money, but mostly wrong for the reason that it does not satisfy other needs to a lasting degree (Bizhelp24, 2010). This supports the idea that human\n\nThe pink theory did surprise me; I thought being rewarded would make a person work harder. That is not the case. It blocks creativity and narrows your focus. Also, how he descried motivation as attaching a candle to the wall so the wax doesn’t dip for a reward. It is true though now after reading this, you got to make the person want to do the job it needs to excite them. Right now at work we have a football game going on, if we make certain benchmarks and depends on how many we make we get a field goal or a touch down. It is going on for three months, it started a month ago. The list of the people who make field goals and touch downs is getting shorter and shorter each week. I think people are getting bored with it and are over it. I know\n\nOne of the first authors that dealt with the sources of motivation was Frederick Taylor who focussed on the overall productivity of an organisation. He linked this productivity to the effort an employee puts into their work which in turn is dependent on monetary rewards (Taylor, 1911). This theory was established in the context of the industrial age and thus is outdated for today’s analysis but it still provides a basic assumption which is often referred to by other authors. The total neglecting of a worker’s intrinsic motivators is a starting point for discussion for authors that conducted research in that area after Taylor."
