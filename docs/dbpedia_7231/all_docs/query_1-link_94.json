        "text": "The truth is you should be motivated to read this book.\n\nDaniel Pink is an author and journalist.\n\nThe big idea of his book is that intrinsic motivation is stronger than contingent incentives and autonomy leads to engagement while control only leads to compliance.\n\nPink demonstrates this idea through a series of stunning case studies and psychological studies.\n\nBut, IMHO, the book could have been better structured and written – and thereby more impactful.\n\nRATING: C."
