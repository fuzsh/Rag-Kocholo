        "text": "To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth about Moving Others\n\nDaniel H. Pink. Riverhead, $26.95 (272p) ISBN 978-1-59448-715-6\n\nPink (A Whole New Mind) has a new message and it is one most people may not want to hear: \"We're all in sales now.\" Like discovering your favorite professor in a box, his fast-moving screed is packed with information, reasons to care about his message, how and why to execute his suggestions, and it's all accentuated with meaningful examples. He introduces a number of key concepts, such as \"social cartography\" and an update of Robert Cialdini's \"contrast principle\", to illustrate the importance of sales. Pink then discusses \"how to's\" via \"motivational interviewing\" and doles out specific tasks, such as learning how to obtain crucial information by asking better questions. His citations of relevant research studies, quizzes, exercises, and admonitions keep readers involved, active, and ready to reach for additional resources. For those tempted to turn away, Pink's examples of companies that didn't remain current, like Encyclopedia Britannica (remember them?), are a wakeup call and really drive his point home. Even if readers only absorb Pink's section on types of sales pitches, they'll understand why this book deserves a good, long look.
