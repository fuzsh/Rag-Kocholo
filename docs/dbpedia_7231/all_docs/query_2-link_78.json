It’s also a great way to become the best version of yourself and inspire others to do the same.\n\nThere’s no better time to curl up in a comfortable armchair with your favorite pet in your lap, drink a cup of tea, and dive into some of the best business books of 2023.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Benefits of Reading Business Books\n\nBest Business Books for Startups\n\nBest Business Leadership Books\n\nBest Business Management Books\n\nBest Books on Business Strategy\n\nBest Books About DEI in Business\n\nBest Innovation Books\n\nBest Business Books for Agencies\n\nThe Benefits of Reading Business Books\n\nNo matter how successful you’ve been in your business or job, how much time you spent in school, or how amazing your team might be, you’re bound to face challenges as you move through your career.\n\nBusiness books — whether they be about starting a business, leading or managing a business, or improving your business — can help you see the problems ahead and create strategies to overcome them.\n\nMost of these books are written by people who have experienced challenges in the business world and lived to tell the tales. Who better to learn from than someone who has already beaten whatever you’re dealing with (or will deal with in the future)?\n\nThere are books for every stage of your career, and here are our favorite reads for those interested in startups, management, DEI, and more.\n\nBest Business Books for Startups\n\nIf there's any silver lining to the economic turmoil we’ve faced, it's that all that unrest has inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs to bring new solutions to market. Starting a new business has a high failure rate — but with the right books, you can increase your chances of surviving.\n\n1.
