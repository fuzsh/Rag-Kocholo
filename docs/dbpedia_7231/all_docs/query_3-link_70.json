        "text": "Discover what it takes to achieve your unique definition of success.\n\nHere are 10 of Walking the Talk's recommended books on success and achievement.\n\n5 Dysfunctions of a Team | Patrick.M Lencioni\n\n\"In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.\n\nKathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.\n\nThroughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nThe Achieving Society | David C. McClelland\n\n\"2010 Reprint of 1961 edition. David C. McClelland (1917- 1998) was an American psychological theorist. Noted for his work on achievement motivation. David McClelland is most noted for describing three types of motivational need, which he identified in his 1961 book, The Achieving Society: 1. achievement motivation, 2. authority/power motivation, 3. affiliation motivation. His now classic book provides a factual basis for evaluating economic, historical, and sociological theories that explain the rise and fall of civilizations. \"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nDrive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us | Daniel.H Pink\n\n\"Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like money--the carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink in Drive. In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction--at work, at school, and at home--is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.\n\nDrawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does-and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation--autonomy, mastery, and purpose--and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nHow to Perform under Pressure: The Science of Doing your Best when it Matters Most | Hendrie Weisinger & J. P. Pawliw-Fry\n\n\"Nobody performs better under pressure. Regardless of the task, pressure ruthlessly diminishes our judgment, decision-making, attention, dexterity, and performance in every professional and personal arena. In Performing Under Pressure, Drs. Hendrie Weisinger and J.P. Pawliw-Fry introduce us to the concept of pressure management, offering empirically tested short term and long term solutions to help us overcome the debilitating effects of pressure.\n\nPerforming Under Pressure tackles the greatest obstacle to personal success, whether in a sales presentation, at home, on the golf course, interviewing for a job, or performing onstage at Carnegie Hall. Despite sports mythology, no one \"rises to the occasion\" under pressure and does better than they do in practice. The reality is pressure makes us do worse, and sometimes leads us to fail utterly. But there are things we can do to diminish its effects on our performance.\n\nPerforming Under Pressure draws on research from over 12,000 people, and features the latest research from neuroscience and from the front line experiences of Fortune 500 employees and managers, Navy SEALS, Olympic and other elite athletes, and others. It offers 22 specific strategies each of us can use to reduce pressure in our personal and professional lives and allow us to better excel in whatever we do.\n\nWhether you’re a corporate manager, a basketball player, or a student preparing for the SAT, Performing Under Pressure will help you to do your best when it matters most.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nThe Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self Control | Walter Mischel\n\n\"Renowned psychologist Walter Mischel, designer of the famous Marshmallow Test, explains what self-control is and how to master it.\n\nA child is presented with a marshmallow and given a choice: Eat this one now, or wait and enjoy two later. What will she do? And what are the implications for her behavior later in life?\n\nThe world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth. But is willpower previewed, or can it be taught?\n\nIn The Marshmallow Test, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life--from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, The Marshmallow Test will change the way you think about who we are and what we can be.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nSwitch: How to Change things when Change is Hard | Chip & Dan Heath\n\n\"Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?\n\nThe primary obstacle is a conflict that’s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems—the rational mind and the emotional mind—that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort—but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.\n\nIn Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people—employees and managers, parents and nurses—have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:\n\n● The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients.\n\n● The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping.\n\n● The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service.\n\nIn a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nAwaken the Giant Within | Anthony Robbins\n\n\"‘Tony’s incredible understanding of the world, people and human nature make him the ultimate like coach. He knows what it takes to make people excel… and win!’ – Andre Agassi\n\n‘Robbins is a mass of walking energy and passion.’ – Time Out\n\nAre you in charge of your life? Or are you being swept away by things that are seemingly out of your control? In AWAKEN THE GIANT WITHIN, Anthony Robbins, the bestselling author of UNLIMITED POWER, shows the reader how to take immediate control of their mental, emotional, physical and financial destiny.\n\nFuture praise for Tony Robbins:\n\n‘A fascinating, intriguing presentation of cutting-edge findings and insights… including the growing consciousness that true success is anchored in enduring values and service to other.’ – Stephen R. Covey, Author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nThe Carpenter: A story about the greatest success strategies of all | Jon Gordon\n\n\"Michael wakes up in the hospital with a bandage on his head and fear in his heart. The stress of building a growing business, with his wife Sarah, caused him to collapse while on a morning jog. When Michael finds out the man who saved his life is a Carpenter he visits him and quickly learns that he is more than just a Carpenter; he is also a builder of lives, careers, people, and teams. As the Carpenter shares his wisdom, Michael attempts to save his business in the face of adversity, rejection, fear, and failure. Along the way he learns that there's no such thing as an overnight success but there are timeless principles to help you stand out, excel, and make an impact on people and the world. Drawing upon his work with countless leaders, sales people, professional and college sports teams, non-profit organizations and schools, Jon Gordon shares an entertaining and enlightening story that will inspire you to build a better life, career, and team with the greatest success strategies of all. \"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nMindset: The New Psychology of Success | Carol Dweck\n\n\"After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.\n\nIn this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.\"\n\nRead this book. . .\n\nThe Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal | Jim Loehr & Tony Schwartz\n\n\"The number of hours in a day is fixed, but the quantity and quality of energy available to us is not.
