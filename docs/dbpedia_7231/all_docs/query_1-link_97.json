        "text": "In the book Drive by Daniel H Pink he talks about various things that could come in handy. Pink talks about how people should change to Motivation 3.0 and leave behind Motivation 2.0.Motivation 3.0 is for someone to continue with their life and have a better future with doing things that you love and would want to do for your rest of your life. Which Motivation also talks about Type X behavior which leads to three types of behavior autonomy mastery and purpose, this explains how people use them to become someone better in their life and show us how that involves with Motivation 3.0. This is something I keep in consideration, that’s why I consider myself in having a Type I behavior that can lead as well with Motivation 3.0.\n\nIn Drive by Daniel H. Pink he explains that motivation 3.0 is energy that is intrinsic. We as human being have a purpose in life and we need motivation to push and strive to find our purpose. The key to motivation is autonomy, its the freedom to do a task when, where, and however you like. i agree that autonomy is important because to work in a place where something is done the same over and over is really boring there no changes and theres no fun. To be in a work place that allows freedom give you the chance to explore and be creative, allows you to have more fun so you don't hate the task and not be motivated to complete it.\n\nIn the introduction and chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Daniel H. Pink expressed how behavioral science can change the common understanding of people’s driving force and suggests a more helpful way to better performance. Pink mentioned that there are two main drives that are powered by behavior. First is the biological drive which comes from within individuals and the second drive comes from without rewards and punishments the environment provides for performing in particular ways. However, a scientist named Harry F. Harlow came up with a third drive after experimenting with monkeys and Harlow called it the “intrinsic motivation.” Harlow said that to completely comprehend the human condition, people have\n\nChoices are such things that most people value making. In this case, I valued choosing a book from the list of summer reading selections. One afternoon, I took a trip to the nearest Barnes and Noble bookstore and sat down to research each book on the list. After about an hour and a half, I decided to read Daniel Pink’s Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us because it interested me the most, and I had previously been seeking anything that could motivate me in everyday life. When I first started reading the book, I felt intrigued about the information Pink was presenting. There was data I did not know about, and continuing to read was the only way to discover more. The process of leafing through the text was quite enjoyable, and stories of people and corporations that changed throughout time fascinated me. By the end of the book, I was extremely motivated and excited to start applying what I had read to my life.\n\nIn chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Author Daniel Pink introduces two types of motivators that he refers to as, “Human operating systems”. Times have changed, and business models are changing as well. Just like we need to upgrade our computer software when it begins to fail. We also need to upgrade our human operating systems, when our current method is not keeping up with the ever-changing business world. The concept of reward and punishment to encourage employees to be more productive is an outdated way of managing people. In order to create a better work environment and increase productivity, we need to upgrade our idea of motivation to include autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nEver since I began my teaching career, I have been fascinated with the topic of motivation and the role it plays in student learning. Daniel Pink’s book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, has been on my personal reading list for a couple of years now, and I was elated to find that it was one of the recommended books to read for this assignment. I have often wondered why some of my students, and even one of my own children, are more internally driven than others to complete a given task. Now that I am in the process of becoming a school administrator, my curiosity about what motivates adults has been heightened, as well. In the hopes of finding some insight, and perhaps the answers to some of my burning questions, I\n\nIn chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, author Daniel Pink introduces two types of motivators that he refers to as, “Human operating systems”.

Throughout the entire talk, there were several interesting points that were made. It really interested me when Pink talked about the group that was rewarded. Pink stated that if the contestants were in the top 25% of the fastest times, they would be rewarded five dollars. With this incentive, most would hope to do well, if not better than the person that would not be rewarded. Pink then goes on to point out the results. How much faster did the group that was offered a reward actually do? On average, it took them three and a half minutes longer. This really stood out to me because when offered a reward for a task, normally a person would be more motivated and thus do better. What amazed me even more was that this isn’t just a one time thing. This is has been replicated over and over for nearly 40 years. As Pink says around 04:33, “These contingent motivators -- if you do this, then you get that -- work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don 't work or, often, they do harm.” These rewards that are being offered are being used to attempt to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, but instead it’s proving to do the opposite. It’s proving to dull thinking and block creativity.\n\nThe success of any business depends on the productivity and satisfaction of its employees. Employees need to be motivated to work. Motivation can be defined as the inner force that drives individuals to accomplish personal and organizational goals. Motivation can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. For an individual to be motivated in a work situation there must be a need, which the individual would have to perceive a possibility of satisfying through some reward. Intrinsic motivation stems from motivations that are inherent and arise from performing the task of the job itself, which the individual gets a feeling of either positive or negative motivation as a result of\n\nMotivation in the workplace is one of the major concerns that managers face when trying to encourage their employees to work harder and do what is expected of them on a day-to-day basis. According to Organizational Behavior by John R. Schermerhorn, James G. Hunt and Richard N. Osborn the definition of motivation is \"the individual forces that account for the direction, level, and persistence of a person's effort expended at work.\" They go on to say that \"motivation is a key concern in firms across the globe.\" Through the years there have been several theories as to what motivates employees to do their best at work. In order to better understand these theories we will apply them to a fictitious organization that has the following\n\nMotivation is the number one driving force behind anything and everything an individual does each day. “Motivation is the desire to do the best possible job or to exert the maximum effort to perform an assigned task. Motivation energizes, directs, and sustains human behavior directed towards a goal.” (Honor, 2009). Motivation can determine the outcome of projects, goals, and can set limits on what an individual can obtain or what they believe they can obtain. Motivation often is the deciding factor on how successful a project in an organization is, and an individual’s needs and desires can both influence a person’s motivation greatly. Motivation can also determine how well an individual does in school, college, or university.\n\nMotivation is the force that makes us do things, whether accomplishing personal goals or completing tasks at work. Most people are motivated as a result of their individual needs being satisfied, which gives them the inspiration to perform specific behaviors for which they receive rewards (Kinicki & Williams, 2011). These needs vary from person to person, as everybody has specific needs to be satisfied. When we consider factors that determine the motivation of employees, many of us think of a high salary. This answer is correct for the reason that some employees will be motivated by money, but mostly wrong for the reason that it does not satisfy other needs to a lasting degree (Bizhelp24, 2010). This supports the idea that human\n\nMotivation is a very broad term that is discussed in a variety of settings. There is the motivation to perform in a business setting, the motivation to perform on the field of competition, the motivation to provide for friends and family, and the motivation to accomplish goals that have been set. These are all various motivations that any one person can be involved with at any time. According to Maslow, motivation always exists within a person and in various forms, “...motivation is constant, never ending, fluctuating, and complex, and that it is an almost universal characteristic of practically every organismic state of affairs” (Maslow, 1954). As complex as motivation seems, it is everyone’s intention to identify their personal\n\nIn the book “DRIVE - the surprising truth about what motivates us”, Daniel Pink says that people will not do a better job if they’re offered a reward. They will do a better job if given the opportunity to work on their own time, be creative and do good. He states, “The secret to high performance and satisfaction is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, learn and create new things and to do better by ourselves and our world”. He speaks about a whole new way that companies should look at human motivation. The book discusses three main components of motivation- autonomy, mastery and purpose. Autonomy describes how people want to be\n\nOsland, et al. (2007) provide a good introduction to three basic motivational content theories. The first theory is Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs that proposes man is motivated by a lack in the one or more of the five common needs. The needs that Maslow identifies are physiological, safety, social belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization. Maslow believed that one fills needs from the most basic (like food and water) to the highest level (self-actualization). Maslow’s ideas are easy to relate to and attempt to provide an all-inclusive approach to the concept of motivation; however, there is little evidence to support the idea that man cannot have self-actualization without the other more basic needs first satisfied. The second content theory Osland, et al. discuss is McCelland’s learned needs. McCelland states that man is motivated by one of three things: achievement, power, or affiliation – or a mixture of the three. Each of these needs can possess a negative or positive connotation or implementation, but it is argued that people motivated by affiliation make better leaders. The third theory presented is McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y. McGregor asserts that Theory X people or employees are inherently lazy and must be controlled and forced to act, whereas Theory Y people are self-controlled, motivated, and ambitious."
