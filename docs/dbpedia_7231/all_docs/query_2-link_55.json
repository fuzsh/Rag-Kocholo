        "text": "Description\n\nThe legendary college football coach and analyst, Lou Holtz once said: “When all is said and done, more is said than done.” These few, yet extremely profound words explain one of the biggest predicaments that individuals face today. Many of us say we want to be successful, happy and influential. Yet, very few of us follow up what we say—whether said to others or ourselves—with specific actions that move us directly toward those goals. The idea of being successful is an attractive dream that fills us with positive emotions. Whereas the actions required to be successful (at work, in our relationships, in sports competition, etc.) are often difficult and lengthy.\n\nSo what do we need to bridge this gap between what we say we want, and what we must do to achieve it? We need goal-oriented motivation. This specific kind of motivation is the fuel that takes us across the long and often uncertain bridge to our desired destination in life. What would it mean to you to learn how to develop this kind of motivation on-demand, sustain this motivation through the difficult periods of life, and instill this motivation so intricately into your daily life that you make the very idea of motivation unnecessary? All of that and more is available to you in this cutting-edge, all new program from personal development expert and motivation master, Brian Tracy."
