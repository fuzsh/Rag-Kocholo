        "text": "Provocative and fascinating -- MALCOLM GLADWELL\n\nPink is rapidly acquiring international guru status . . . He is an engaging writer, who challenges and provokes * * Financial Times * *\n\nA bold and persuasive call to bring our understanding of human motivation out of the realm of folklore and into the realm of science . . . Drive will make you rethink everything you do to motivate yourself and those around you -- RICHARD WISEMAN, author of 59 Seconds and Quirkology\n\nInspiring * * Guardian * *\n\nPunchy and energetic * * Financial Times * *\n\nWhat really drives high performance? In this eye-opening book, Daniel Pink draws on 40 years of science to offer some surprising answers. He shows the limits of carrots and sticks and explores the hard-headed power of autonomy, mastery, and purpose to help us work smarter and live better -- CHRIS ANDERSON, author of The Long Tail and Free\n\nAs Dan Pink's new book Drive argues, financial incentives are no longer enough to give a business an edge: in an economy driven by ideas and creativity, it's more effective to give workers a sense of purpose, of mastery, of autonomy over their time and their tasks. Because the only certainty in the decade to come is that disruptive change is going to continue to catch out businesses that are unprepared * * Daily Telegraph * *\n\nDrive drives a stake through the bedrock of classic \"if-then\" motivational theory. It demonstrates in an entertaining way how self-motivated rewards provide their own behavioural alchemy, exposing the mismatch between what science knows and business does -- JAMES BORG, author of Persuasion: The Art of Influencing People\n\nDrive is the rare book that will get you to think and inspire you to act. Pink makes a strong, science-based case for rethinking motivation - and then provides the tools you need to transform your life -- DR MEHMET OZ, co-author of You: The Owner's Manual\n\nPink's ideas deserve a wide hearing. Corporate boards, in fact, could do well by kicking out their pay consultants for an hour and reading Pink's conclusions instead * * Forbes * *"
