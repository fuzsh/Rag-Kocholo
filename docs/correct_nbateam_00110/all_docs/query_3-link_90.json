        "text": "For any other player, getting suspended over a food fight with an assistant coach would take the cake as their most memorable moment.\n\nBut for Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard J.R. Smith, his latest incident with Damon Jones is just another drop in the soup bowl. Nobody was surprised when the circumstances of Smith's one-game suspension emerged, which speaks to just how high he has set the bar.\n\nThe Henny God is a champion, one of the most proficient shooters in NBA history, and a decorated 14-year veteran, but perhaps best known for a countless list of off-court stories.\n\nHere are some of his most memorable moments.\n\nLover and a fighter\n\nGood ol' J.R. is always getting himself into trouble, from his comically forward texts to his love-hate relationship with Rihanna.\n\nSmith is the king of the 'shoot your shot' movement both on and off the court. He was exposed for sending an inappropriately direct message to a woman he was chatting with after asking if she wanted ... ya know.\n\nAnd who could forget his love affair with Rihanna where the two were rumored to be together during his tenure with the Knicks? After that went haywire, J.R. gladly exposed her apparent bandwagon fandom of LeBron James, earning All-Petty first-team honors. Maybe that relationship with RiRi was just a pipe dream?\n\n- Wael Saghir\n\nGiving up on the play\n\nThe NBA certainly holds a more friendly atmosphere among the players than in previous generations, but Smith took that to the extreme during a game against the Bucks last season.\n\nWith just under three minutes left in the second quarter, Smith opted to greet Jason Terry on the Bucks bench, thinking play hadn't resumed yet out of a timeout. Unfortunately for the Cavs, it had resumed, and the man Smith was guarding, Tony Snell, took the pass for an easy bucket. When asked what happened afterward, it was a classic J.R. answer.\n\n\"I didn't even know I was in the game,\" Smith said, as per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com. \"My bad.\"\n\n- Dane Belbeck\n\nThe misadventures of Chinese MJ\n\nJ.R. was just one of dozens of players who took their talents overseas to the Chinese Basketball Association during the 2011 lockout, but nobody left behind more memories (and ill feelings) than Smith.\n\nLet's go over the positives: Smith once scored 60 points with 14 threes off the bench; he had a 52-point, 22-rebound, 11-triple, and seven-assist masterpiece; and he averaged nearly 35 points across 34 memorable games. His mind-blowing performances earned him the nickname of \"Chinese MJ.\"\n\nThe negatives? There's almost too many to count. For starters, he missed nearly 80 practices during his time there, which led to a legal dispute over $1 million in fines. He took unexplained trips to Shanghai, Beijing, and London, while also making unreasonable demands.\n\nHis sister also became a problem. Not only would Smith take her shopping instead of showing up for team functions, but she also brawled with fans after a no-call in one of her brother's games. Angry fans then stormed Smith's bus and delayed their departure for nearly an hour as they demanded an apology.\n\nJ.R. was probably just bored with the whole experience. He racked up a $3,000 tab in his hotel room just because he wanted to test the limits to which he would be served.\n\n- William Lou\n\nMan of the people\n\nFor a millionaire athlete, Smith is nothing if not accessible. In the early morning hours of May 31, 2012, the then-Knicks guard tweeted he was hitting the streets of Manhattan for a bike ride.\n\nEventually getting together a crew on the Upper West Side, a peloton of what he later said was 22 people took in the sights of wee-hours New York City.\n\n- John Chick\n\nA cheery champion\n\nSmith celebrated his first ever NBA title by taking off his shirt and basically not putting one on again for the whole summer. \"Shirtless J.R. Smith\" was first seen partying at a Las Vegas nightclub with his teammates, some of whom he even inspired to remove their tops. Shirts were apparently optional at the Cavaliers' championship parade, where Smith said: \"Nah.\"\n\nHe continued to make the same casual fashion statement whether he was at a pool party, concert, or waiting to be re-signed. His shirtless summer became such a big deal that he started selling T-shirts so others could wear his naked torso, someone made a video game demo about it, and then-President Barack Obama requested Smith wear a shirt when the team visited the White House (spoiler alert: he obliged).\n\n- Victoria Nguyen\n\nHacked by himself\n\nIt was the early morning of June 8, 2017, and the Cavaliers now found themselves down 3-0 to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.\n\nSuddenly, at 12:04 a.m. ET, an innocuous tweet surfaces on Smith's Twitter. It reads: \"Cavs in 7.\"\n\nBut, rather than own the bold take as some show of support for his on-the-brink team, Smith immediately deleted the tweet and hilariously pinned it on some mischievous hacker before admitting: \"I like the way he's thinking.\"\n\nWhoever it was, they looked like a genius on the levels of Nostradamus when the Cavaliers handily won Game 4. That was short-lived, though, when the Warriors won Game 5 and locked up their second championship in three seasons.\n\n- Jonathan Soveta"
