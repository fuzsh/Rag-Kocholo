        "text": "Smith recorded 24 points (9-20 FG, 6-11 3Pt), six rebounds, three assists and one steal across 33 minutes during Sunday's 120-110 win over the Cavaliers.\n\nSmith was the leading scorer in the Hornets' regular-season finale Sunday. His 24 points and six made threes were both career highs as he saw extended playing time with Charlotte sitting multiple rotational players. Over the last two games of the season, Smith averaged 19.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists over 31.0 minutes per contest.\n\nSmith finished with 15 points (5-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three rebounds and two assists in 29 minutes during Friday's 131-98 loss to the Celtics.\n\nSmith's 15 points Friday marked the first time he's reached double-digit scoring since Feb. 9 against the Bucks. He's spent time in the G League with the Greensboro Swarm, but with the Hornets down several players due to injury, Smith could see another heavy workload in Sunday's regular-season finale against the Cavaliers.\n\nSmith finished with four points (2-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt), three rebounds and one assist across 18 minutes in Wednesday's 89-86 loss to the Trail Blazers.\n\nSince being recalled from the G League on March 4, Smith has averaged just 2.3 points in 8.1 minutes, shooting 28.9 percent from the field. Prior to the All-Star break, the 19-year-old's numbers were considerably better, as he averaged 6.6 points in 15.8 minutes and shot 40.6 percent from the field. Despite his poor shooting lately, expect the rookie to receive playing time as the season winds down with LaMelo Ball (ankle), Seth Curry (ankle) and Cody Martin (ankle) out for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Hornets recalled Smith from the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Thursday.\n\nSmith will be available for Thursday's game versus the Bucks. The rookie guard is averaging 6.5 points, 1.5 assists and 1.0 rebounds in 16.4 minutes across his last 10 appearances for Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets recalled Smith from the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Wednesday.\n\nThe arrival of several new players last week in the aftermath of the trade deadline resulted in Smith getting pushed out of the rotation and assigned to Greensboro, where he'll likely get the chance to play extended minutes. Though he's back with Charlotte for Wednesday's game versus Atlanta, Smith is uncertain to re-emerge in head coach Steve Clifford's rotation.\n\nThe Hornets assigned Smith to the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Monday.\n\nIn the wake of Thursday's trade deadline, the Hornets essentially overhauled their second unit. After appearing in each of the previous 28 games and averaging 18.3 minutes, Smith didn't leave the bench in Saturday's 115-106 win over the Grizzlies, and Nathan Mensah, Leaky Black and Bryce McGowens were also spectators after having previously been included in the rotation. Meanwhile, new arrivals Vasilije Micic, Seth Curry, Grant Williams and Davis Bertans all had roles off the bench in the win. Smith's demotion to the G League likely signals that the Hornets will stick with the new veteran group as their core players on the second unit for Monday's game against the Pacers.\n\nSmith racked up 12 points (4-10 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and one steal over 21 minutes during Friday's 126-106 loss to Oklahoma City.\n\nSmith's skinny frame and lack of true point-guard instincts give him a learning curve as a rookie, but his three-point shooting has been off-the-charts. He connected on just 33.8 percent of 4.2 threes per game during his one-and-done campaign at Arkansas last year, so his 47.9 percent clip through 94 attempts thus far is a revelation.\n\nSmith logged eight points (3-4 FG, 2-3 3Pt), two rebounds and two assists across 15 minutes during Monday's 128-125 victory over Minnesota.\n\nSmith was conducive to good ball movement and offensive activity for the Hornets on Monday, although he provided his scoring value by being a reliable spot-up man in the corner. The rookie profiles as a two-way sparkplug at the moment and is forming an exciting foundation, connecting on 45.5 percent of 77 three-point attempts thus far\n\nSmith finished Monday's 119-112 overtime loss to Chicago with 15 points (6-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt), four rebounds, three assists and one steal across 32 minutes.\n\nThe 27th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft has forced his way into a significant role in the backcourt rotation over the last few weeks with an impressive performance from beyond the arc. Over the last eight games, Smith has drained multiple three-pointers six times and shot 58.1 percent from long distance, averaging 9.5 points, 2.3 threes, 2.1 boards and 1.8 assists in only 18.6 minutes a night from the second unit. LaMelo Ball (ankle) is closing in on his return, which will shake things up, but Smith's current run will make it tough for coach Steve Clifford to return the rookie to the end of the bench.\n\nSmith closed with six points (2-3 FG, 2-3 3Pt), one assist and two blocks across 14 minutes during Tuesday's 111-104 victory over Sacramento.\n\nWith Charlotte shorthanded, Smith has played double-digit minutes in nine straight games, averaging 8.1 points on 45.2 percent shooting during that stretch. He should continue to garner a modest bench role as long as LaMelo Ball (ankle), Brandon Miller (hip) and Gordon Hayward (calf) remain out, but Smith isn't producing enough to be on fantasy radars in standard leagues.\n\nSmith will remain in the second unit for Tuesday's game against the Clippers.\n\nComing off a 19-point outing in Saturday's loss against Denver, Smith could have a relevant role with Brandon Miller (ankle) inactive. He could factor into small-ball lineups for Charlotte with Mark Williams (back) out.\n\nThe Hornets recalled Smith from the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Thursday.\n\nSmith spent just a few days in the G League but will now rejoin the parent club. Over eight appearances with the Hornets this year, he's averaged 4.0 points in 7.1 minutes per game.\n\nSmith (ankle) has been ruled out for Monday's game against Maimi.\n\nAs expected, Smith has been downgraded from doubtful to out and will miss a second straight game. The rookie hasn't been a consistent part of the rotation, so his absence shouldn't impact fantasy.\n\nSmith (ankle) has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Raptors.\n\nAs expected, Smith has been downgraded from doubtful to out. It's unclear when exactly he sprained his ankle, but he scored 14 points in Greensboro's blowout loss to Capital City on Thursday. Smith hasn't been a regular part of Charlotte's rotation, so his absence shouldn't have a fantasy impact.\n\nThe Hornets list Smith as doubtful for Friday's game against the Raptors with a right ankle sprain.\n\nSmith was called up from the G League's Greensboro Swarm earlier in the day, but he doesn't look like he'll be on track to play Friday against the Raptors while he manages the ankle injury. Even when healthy, Smith hasn't been a regular member of the Charlotte rotation during his rookie season. He's appeared in eight of the Hornets' first 19 games, averaging 4.0 points and 0.6 rebounds in 7.1 minutes per contest.\n\nThe Hornets assigned Smith to the Greensboro Swarm of the G League on Thursday.\n\nSmith's assignment to the Swarm marks his second of the season. The rookie guard has been an inconsistent part of Charlotte's rotation and should receive extended playing time in the G League."
