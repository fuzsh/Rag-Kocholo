        "text": "J.R. Smith News\n\nCavaliers Waive J.R. Smith\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have waived veteran guard J.R. Smith, clearing the way for Smith to join a contending team. Smith averaged 6.7 points and shot just 30.8 percent from the field last season, but played in just 11 games for Cleveland. A healthy Smith could be a decent bench piece for a playoff team, but he's unlikely to find a role where he'll be more than a team's fourth or fifth guard. That means Smith's fantasy stock is likely to vary wildly on a game-to-game basis, making him someone not worth rostering in most league formats. The only exception would be if Smith doesn't sign with a contender and prioritizes signing somewhere where he'll receive minutes, though it's unclear if a team like that exists.\n\nJul 16\n\nJ.R. Smith Logs Productive 39 Minutes On Tuesday\n\nCleveland Cavaliers shooting guard J.R. Smith, who missed practice with an illness on Monday, was perfectly fine on Tuesday night against the Hornets, leading the team with a plus-26 rating and scoring 13 points with three triples in 39 minutes. He shot 3-for-7 from deep and 5-for-13 overall. Smith also recorded his fifth consecutive game with at least one steal and had his third block in the last four games. He's now scored 10-plus points in four of his last five outings, finding some consistency after a rough start to the year. If he doesn't get rested on the second night of a back-to-back situation, then Smith has a great matchup on Wednesday against a defensively poor Wizards team.\n\nNov 14\n\nJ.R. Smith Will Play on Tuesday\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith (illness) is not listed on the injury report for Tuesday's game against the Charlotte Hornets. He missed Monday's practice due to an illness, but has been removed from the injury report. Cedi Osman (back) and Kyle Korver (foot) will be sidelined for this game. Smith should see some extra playing time alongside Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood.\n\nNov 13\n\nJ.R. Smith, Kyle Korver Miss Monday's Practice\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guards J.R. Smith (illness) and Kyle Korver (foot) did not participate in Monday's practice. Both players are being considered questionable for Tuesday's game against the Charlotte Hornets. Neither player is a reliable fantasy option, but should continue to see chances with the Cavs tanking. Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and possibly David Nwaba should see more chances with the Cavs roster banged up.\n\nNov 12\n\nJ.R. Smith Ruled Out on Friday\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guard/forward J.R. Smith (elbow) has been ruled out of Friday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Smith was dealing with a hip issue in the preseason, but now has elbow soreness. It's unclear how serious this issue is right now, but Smith could be sidelined a few more games. Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood will handle the shooting guard duties against Minnesota. Cedi Osman should see minutes in the mid 30s in this one.\n\nOct 19\n\nJ.R. Smith Ruled Out for Wednesday\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith (elbow) has been ruled out for Wednesday's season opener against the Toronto Raptors. He was already doubtful heading into this one, so it's not surprising to see him officially ruled out. Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood should see extended run without Smith in the rotation. Smith isn't worth owning in just about any leagues right now.\n\nOct 17\n\nJ.R. Smith Records 10 Points In Game 4\n\nCleveland Cavaliers shooting guard/small forward J.R. Smith scored all 10 of his points in the first half as his club got swept in the finals to end their season. Smith converted 3-for-8 from the floor and played some excellent defense throughout this game on Kevin Durant to contain the superstar to just 20 points. We will have to see if Smith can bounce back next season after his Game 1 blunder, as he is on the books for two more years with the Cavs and is owed nearly $31 million over those two seasons.\n\nJun 9\n\nJ.R. Smith With Decent Outing\n\nCleveland Cavaliers shooting guard/small forward J.R. Smith came out firing in this one, but his club still managed the Game 3 loss to the Golden State Warriors. Smith started the game hot, scoring five of the Cavs first eight points en route to 13 total points on the night. Smith also chipped in four rebounds with three steals in his 33 minutes of action. We know Smith will come out firing in Game 4, which makes him a serious look for fantasy owners. If he can get hot, he can definitely be worth an add to your DFS lineup.\n\nJun 7\n\nJ.R. Smith Quiet in Game 2 Loss\n\nCleveland Cavaliers shooting guard/small forward J.R. Smith could not make up for his Game 1 mistake scoring just five points in 31 minutes of action as his club lost Game 2. Cleveland fans were hoping to see the sniper turn up in this one to put his Game 1 mistake behind him but it was not Smith's night. He was non-factor in this one and we can hope the wing player can turn it around as the series moves back to Cleveland where hopefully the home fans can help Smith to get going again.\n\nJun 4"
