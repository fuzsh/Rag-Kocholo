        "text": "According to multiple reports, the Charlotte Hornets are re-signing guard Seth Curry to a one year deal.\n\nNo word on the terms of the deal, but typically deals reported like this are for the veteran minimum, which is close to $3 million for Curry.\n\nYou can keep those Curry #30 jerseys out of the closet for at least one more year. The Hornets brought Seth home as part of the trade that sent PJ Washington to the Mavericks and also brought home Grant Williams. Curry only appeared in eight games for the Hornets before an ankle injury ended his season. He never caught his rhythm and only hit 32.1% of his 3-point attempts, but that’ll climb next season. He’s a career 43.1% 3-point shooter and hadn’t finished a season with a 3-point percentage below 42% prior to last season.\n\nSeth joins a crowded guard rotation, but his ability to play both guard positions will surely get him time throughout the season, even if he’s not a regular rotation player. He’s probably best as an off ball guard, but he can handle the ball and run bench units if called upon to do that.\n\nThe Hornets now have LaMelo Ball, Vasilije Micic, Reggie Jackson (for now?), Tre Mann, Josh Green, Seth Curry, Cody Martin, and Nick Smith Jr. as their guard rotation. Every player in that group is a quality NBA player (except for NSJ, for now…). That’s not something the Hornets have been able to say in recent seasons.\n\nThis move was reportedly always in the cards, even after the Hornets waived Curry before the start of free agency. Now he’s back playing for his hometown team in front of his dad. If nothing else, it’s a move that’s going to improve fan morale."
