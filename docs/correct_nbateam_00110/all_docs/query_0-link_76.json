        "text": "Two weeks after J.R. Smith announced on Instagram he was re-signing with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team provided confirmation on Wednesday.\n\nSmith and the Cavaliers agreed to a two-year deal, Northeast Ohio Media Group’s Chris Haynes reported. Smith will earn $5 million next season and hold a player option on the second year. The deal will also have a no-trade clause.\n\nSmith opted out of the final year of his previous contract with the Cavaliers in June, foregoing the $6.4 million he would have been owed during the 2015–16 season. Smith had been expected to return to the Cavaliers, although the team was reportedly offering him less than $6.4 million.\n\n• MORE NBA: Raptors win big in Jonas Valanciunas extension | Grades\n\nIn his Instagram post, Smith wrote:\n\n2015-16 NBA schedule: Top 50 games\n\n​“Happy to say that I am returning to the Cavs! It’s been a long ride this summer but I can say for sure, well worth the wait. When I opted out of my contract, I wanted to understand the landscape of the NBA and where I fit best. The Cavaliers had things they needed to do in order to piece together a championship caliber roster. I ended up deciding that instead of potentially securing a larger deal elsewhere, I wanted to rejoin an incredible organization in pursuit of the ultimate goal, an NBA championship. Thank you to the Cavaliers for making this happen. Can’t wait to get started! #TheLand”\n\nSmith, 30 next month, was traded to the Cavaliers on Jan. 5 by the New York Knicks, coming to Cleveland with Iman Shumpert in a three-team blockbuster that also included the Oklahoma City Thunder. In 46 games with the Cavaliers, he averaged 12.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists over 31.8 minutes per game. He shot 42.5% from the field and 39% from three-point range.\n\n• MORE NBA: SI Roundtable | Al Horford Q&A | 30 best contracts\n\nThe Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference before losing to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.\n\nOver his 11-year NBA career, Smith has averaged 13.2 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists with New Orleans, the Denver Nuggets, Knicks and Cavaliers.\n\nLeBron James also acknowledged Smith’s return on Twitter after his Instagram post.\n\n- Mike Fiammetta"
