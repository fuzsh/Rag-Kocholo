        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE — Nick Smith is the second Arkansas basketball player and freshman off the board in the 2023 NBA Draft.\n\nA native of Jacksonville, Smith was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the No. 27 overall pick in this year’s draft. Razorbacks guard Anthony Black was taken No. 6 overall by the Orlando Magic.\n\nWith Smith’s selection, Arkansas has a pair of first-round draft picks for the first time since 1992 — 12 years before either player was born.\n\n“Terrific first step, excellent in transition, and he can create his own,” ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas said. “Good vision, but what I like best about him, he's got a competitive nature to him that is different from most really good players.\n\n“He's a lottery pick.”\n\nSmith was the first Razorback to declare for the draft after the team’s Sweet 16 loss to UConn in March.\n\n“I don’t think that Arkansas Razorback fans, I don’t think that college basketball fans and I certainly don’t think NBA evaluators got to see what they’re going to see in the future,” Arkansas coach Eric Musselman said last week on the Aaron Torres Sports Podcast. “Great competitor and a guy that I think has got incredible upside.”\n\nA projected top-five pick prior to the 2022-23 season, Smith’s time at Arkansas was marred by a knee injury that forced him to miss 19 games and ultimately caused him to slide in the draft.\n\nMusselman added that Smith injured the knee during the team’s foreign tour last August. Smith did not play in Arkansas’ first 6 games, played the following 5, then missed 13 more before re-joining the team on Feb. 11 for the stretch run.\n\nHe averaged 12.4 points on 37.2% shooting and 35.3% from three-point range, and 1.6 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 0.9 steals in the final 12 games. For the season, Smith put up 12.5 points on 37.6% shooting and 33.8% beyond the arc.\n\n“He’s going to surprise a lot of people because of the season he had dealing with an injury,” Musselman said.\n\nESPN projected Smith at No. 22 in its latest mock draft, and Sam Vecenie of The Athletic projected him as the No. 26 pick.\n\n“Smith was a top-three recruit in the class last season and has real off-ball scoring creativity,” Vecenie wrote. “His high school tape is quite strong. His range is a bit wide, but I’m willing to bet that last season is a bit more of an aberration than people think.”\n\nSmith reportedly had pre-draft workouts with several teams, including the Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls.\n\nCharlotte also drafted Smith's former AAU teammate and Alabama star Brandon Miller with the second pick of the draft."
