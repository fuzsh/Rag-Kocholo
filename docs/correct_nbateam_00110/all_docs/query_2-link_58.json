        "text": "Why He’s Interesting: Smith and Cleveland are in the midst of a love affair. It didn’t take long for the swoon-worthy, smooth-shooting baller to enter our hearts after joining the team in a 2015 trade. After helping the Cavs win the 2016 NBA championship by averaging 10.6 points and 1.4 steals per game in the Finals, the one-time bad boy further embraced the city with shirtless hugs and high-fives during the victory parade and autograph signings around town this summer. He’s also settled down, getting married and announcing that he and his wife are expecting their second child — his third.\n\nHome Towns: Central New Jersey born and raised, Smith feels more kinship for Cleveland than other cities such as Denver, New York City or New Orleans where he’s played. “You can tell a lot of people here care. They really care about the sports teams, but they care about people in general. It reminds me a lot of home. If you work hard, people respect you for it.”\n\nWild Child: Smith’s reputation before coming to Cleveland was as a partier who didn’t reach his full potential. But his new marriage and a kiddo on the way has contributed to changing that narrative. “I can honestly say everything’s coming around — career-wise, family-wise. From where I was at three or four years ago is just totally a different space. I’m just so comfortable, and everything is moving the right way.”\n\nWhat to Expect: Smith, who’s full name is Earl Smith III, already has two young daughters, so he’s hoping for a baby boy this time. “Just so I can keep the legacy going. I’m the third. It’d be cool to have a fourth. If it’s a girl, I’m cool with that. My girls take care of me.”\n\nParental Guidance: Smith’s teary post championship thanks to his father — on Father’s Day no less — was an emotional moment for all involved. “This wouldn’t be possible for me if he didn’t take the time out to show me everything he knew about the game. He’s my biggest inspiration.”\n\nNo Shirt, No Problem: “As a kid I never wore a shirt — like never. Whenever we played shirts and skins, I was always on the skins team. Shirts and socks or shoes: I’d never have either one on.”\n\nGolf Galaxy: The avid golfer thrives on that game’s similarities to shooting a basketball. “There’s so many obstacles and angles that I think is so similar.” While his short game is on point, Smith’s long game could use some work. “I can hit the ball a mile, it’s just hard for me to keep it straight.”\n\nVisiting Team: As NBA champions, Smith and the Cavs were invited to the White House in November to be honored by President Barack Obama. Smith and LeBron James geeked out over some of the more than 200-year-old books and other artifacts inside. “Bron and I took a few glances at different books. We kind of jotted them down to see if we can look them up on iBooks or something.”"
