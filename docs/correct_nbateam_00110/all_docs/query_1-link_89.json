        "text": "Hornets' Nick Smith: Leading scorer off bench Sunday\n\nSmith recorded 24 points (9-20 FG, 6-11 3Pt), six rebounds, three assists and one steal across 33 minutes during Sunday's 120-110 win over the Cavaliers. Smith was the leading scorer in the Hornets' regular-season finale Sunday. His 24 points and six made threes were both career highs as he saw extended playing time with Charlotte sitting multiple rotational players. Over the last two games of the season, Smith averaged 19.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists over 31.0 minutes per contest.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Leads bench in scoring vs. Boston\n\nSmith finished with 15 points (5-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three rebounds and two assists in 29 minutes during Friday's 131-98 loss to the Celtics. Smith's 15 points Friday marked the first time he's reached double-digit scoring since Feb. 9 against the Bucks. He's spent time in the G League with the Greensboro Swarm, but with the Hornets down several players due to injury, Smith could see another heavy workload in Sunday's regular-season finale against the Cavaliers.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Back with Hornets\n\nThe Hornets recalled Smith from the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Wednesday. The arrival of several new players last week in the aftermath of the trade deadline resulted in Smith getting pushed out of the rotation and assigned to Greensboro, where he'll likely get the chance to play extended minutes. Though he's back with Charlotte for Wednesday's game versus Atlanta, Smith is uncertain to re-emerge in head coach Steve Clifford's rotation.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Impressive three-point efficiency\n\nSmith racked up 12 points (4-10 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and one steal over 21 minutes during Friday's 126-106 loss to Oklahoma City. Smith's skinny frame and lack of true point-guard instincts give him a learning curve as a rookie, but his three-point shooting has been off-the-charts. He connected on just 33.8 percent of 4.2 threes per game during his one-and-done campaign at Arkansas last year, so his 47.9 percent clip through 94 attempts thus far is a revelation.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Hits two triples in win\n\nSmith closed with six points (2-3 FG, 2-3 3Pt), one assist and two blocks across 14 minutes during Tuesday's 111-104 victory over Sacramento. With Charlotte shorthanded, Smith has played double-digit minutes in nine straight games, averaging 8.1 points on 45.2 percent shooting during that stretch. He should continue to garner a modest bench role as long as LaMelo Ball (ankle), Brandon Miller (hip) and Gordon Hayward (calf) remain out, but Smith isn't producing enough to be on fantasy radars in standard leagues.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Ruled out\n\nSmith (ankle) has been ruled out for Monday's game against Maimi. As expected, Smith has been downgraded from doubtful to out and will miss a second straight game. The rookie hasn't been a consistent part of the rotation, so his absence shouldn't impact fantasy.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Downgraded to out\n\nSmith (ankle) has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Raptors. As expected, Smith has been downgraded from doubtful to out. It's unclear when exactly he sprained his ankle, but he scored 14 points in Greensboro's blowout loss to Capital City on Thursday. Smith hasn't been a regular part of Charlotte's rotation, so his absence shouldn't have a fantasy impact.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Nursing ankle injury\n\nThe Hornets list Smith as doubtful for Friday's game against the Raptors with a right ankle sprain. Smith was called up from the G League's Greensboro Swarm earlier in the day, but he doesn't look like he'll be on track to play Friday against the Raptors while he manages the ankle injury. Even when healthy, Smith hasn't been a regular member of the Charlotte rotation during his rookie season. He's appeared in eight of the Hornets' first 19 games, averaging 4.0 points and 0.6 rebounds in 7.1 minutes per contest.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Back to NBA\n\nCharlotte recalled Smtih from the G League's Greensboro Swarm on Friday. Smith's second G League assignment of the season lasted just one day. The rookie recorded 14 points (5-6 FG, 4-5 3Pt), three assists and one rebound during Greensboro's blowout loss to Capital City on Thursday.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Returns to G League\n\nThe Hornets assigned Smith to the Greensboro Swarm of the G League on Thursday. Smith's assignment to the Swarm marks his second of the season. The rookie guard has been an inconsistent part of Charlotte's rotation and should receive extended playing time in the G League.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Recalled to Charlotte\n\nSmith was called up to Charlotte's main roster Tuesday evening. Smith made his G League debut with the Greensboro Swarm earlier in the day Tuesday, delivering 21 points, three rebounds and three assists in a win over Capital City. His matinee cameo ends with a return to the Hornets, where he's averaged 4.0 points in 7.1 minutes per game across eight appearances this season\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Assigned to G League\n\nThe Hornets assigned Nick Smith to the Greensboro Swarm of the G League on Monday. This is the first G League assignment of the season for Smith. The rookie hasn't been utilized much in Charlotte, appearing in eight games with an average of 7.1 minutes per contest.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Perfect from three in win\n\nSmith recorded a career-high nine points (3-4 FG, 3-3 3Pt) along with one rebound and one block across 14 minutes in Thursday's 129-128 victory over the Nets. It appears Smith will get more opportunities off the bench after an MRI confirmed LaMelo Ball sustained a right ankle sprain, sidelining him for at least a week. In Smith's last six games, he has averaged 8.7 minutes per game, so expect that to trend upwards in the immediate future.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Scores career-high eight points\n\nSmith supplied eight points (3-4 FG, 2-2 3Pt) in five minutes during Tuesday's 115-91 loss to the Knicks. Smith played in just his seventh game of the season Tuesday, scoring a career-high eight points in five minutes. The Hornets recently lost LaMelo Ball to what is being described as a serious ankle sprain. While Smith is still buried on the depth chart, there is a chance the Hornets may opt to see what they have in Smith, especially if their current trajectory holds. He is clearly not someone who needs to be prioritized, but the situation warrants at least some attention.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Scores 11 points\n\nSmith produced 11 points (4-10 FG, 0-2 3PT, 3-4 FT), five rebounds and two turnovers in 20 minutes of Tuesday's 113-109 preseason loss to Miami. Smith certainly had his moments, and he showed plenty of promise during Summer League. The rookie guard is expected to spend some time in the G League this season with the Hornets loaded at guard, so he's unlikely to have a fantasy impact in most leagues early on.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Will get some run in G League\n\nSmith (undisclosed) is expected to get some playing time in the G League this season, Sam Perley of NBA.com reports. Smith, the 27th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, was a lot of fun to watch at Summer League before he was shut down. However, the Hornets have a ton of depth at guard with LaMelo Ball back in action, so it will be hard for the rookie to carve out playing time at the NBA level early on in his career.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Won't play Saturday\n\nSmith is unavailable for Saturday's Summer League game against the Timberwolves due to an undisclosed reason, Sam Perley of the Hornets' official site reports. Smith had been one of Charlotte's Summer League standouts. The rookie forward will likely compete for a depth role at the forward position in 2023-24.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nHornets' Nick Smith: Solid production against Warriors\n\nSmith tallied 14 points (6-13 FG,1-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) five rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes during Wednesday's 98-83 Summer League loss to the Warriors. After going 5-for-14 from the field in his Summer League debut against San Antonio, Smith bounced back with some solid efficiency Wednesday. His three-point shot remains a concern, but he has flashed an ability to get to the rim.\n\n... See More ... See Less"
