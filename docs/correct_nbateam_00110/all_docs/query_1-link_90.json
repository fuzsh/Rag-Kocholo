        "text": "Arkansas Razorback and North Little Rock graduate Nick Smith Jr. was selected No. 27 overall in the NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nSmith is the second Razorback to be drafted in 2023, after by the Orlando Magic.\n\nThis is the first time multiple Razorbacks have been selected in the first round since 1992.\n\nSmith saw his draft positioning slide from the a projected middle-round pick to the end of the first round.\n\nComing out of high school, Smith was the top recruit in the entire country before committing to play for his home-state Hogs.\n\nHowever, injuries saddled his freshman season, causing him to play in only 17 games. In those games, Smith Jr. averaged 12.5 points and 1.6 rebound."
