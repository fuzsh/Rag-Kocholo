Smith is out against the Charlotte Hornets because of a sore right ankle.\n\nThe Cavaliers said Smith tweaked the ankle Friday night against Washington. Mike Dunleavy will start at shooting guard Sunday for the defending champions, who are 7-1 and have the best record in the Eastern Conference.\n\nSmith is averaging 10.5 points and had made 36 per cent of his 3-point attempts. Dunleavy, who is starting for the first time this season, is 7 of 23 from the 3-point line and is averaging 4.4 points."
