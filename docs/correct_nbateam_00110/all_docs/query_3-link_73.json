        "text": "Throughout the season, the Cleveland Cavaliers and their fans had the utmost confidence in J.R. Smith. Well, not exactly Smith the player per se, he was exiled from the team in late November, but rather his contract. Smith's arrangement with Cleveland was unique, where a team could send the Cavaliers close to $15 million in bad money and then waive Smith before July 1, where he would then only count for $3.8 million against their salary cap for the 2019-20 season.\n\nCleveland had their first opportunity to move Smith at the annual trade deadline but nothing came to fruition. It was a little disheartening to not see a trade happen but Cleveland general manager Koby Altman felt sure that they could still get something for Smith.\n\nWe have a trade chip in J.R. Smith, and his contract, where we can take on some money that other teams are trying to get some cap relief from,” said Altman during his end of season availability. “We are actually the only team in the NBA that can provide guaranteed cap relief until July 1. We can guarantee that right now and we actually had a phone call (Thursday) on that trade chip, so, we’re going to keep on being aggressive adding those assets because we do eventually want to consolidate and be really good at some point.”\n\nThat's fine, though the Cavaliers could try again at the 2019 NBA Draft and try and obtain future assets. Team's like the Miami Heat were interested in Smith and were reportedly even offering the No. 13 pick for Cleveland to take back a contract like James Johnson's. But, the draft came and went and much like the trade deadline, Smith is still a member of Cleveland's roster.\n\nBut it's not like Altman wasn't trying to move the disgruntled shooting guard. According to Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor, the Cavaliers had a few offers on the table but they were reluctant to pull the trigger. The reason is that any future money the Cavaliers take on will put them over the luxury tax, which would have harsh penalties for a repeater like Cleveland. That doesn't make a lot of sense for a team that Vegas has projected to win only 24.5 games next year.\n\nIs it disappointing that Cleveland was unable to flip Smith's contract for future assets? Absolutely. It's even more frustrating knowing he has been paid for the majority of the season just to stay away. There's still time for Altman to try and make something out of nothing, but at this point it seems likely that the team will just waive Smith. After that, he is expected to join the Los Angeles Lakers to play alongside Cavaliers legend LeBron James.\n\nEven though the end of Smith's time in Cleveland will go down as a weird chapter in Cavaliers history, but it also isn't the first time something like this has happened. Remember Brendan Haywood's time with the Cavaliers? If you blinked, you probably missed it. In the 22 games he appeared in, Haywood averaged 1.6 points and 1.3 rebounds in just 5.4 minutes per game.\n\nAt this point, you’re probably wondering, \"Who cares about some fourteenth man that barely played for the Cavaliers?\" Well, while Haywood's time in Cleveland was unremarkable, his biggest selling point was that he had a non-guaranteed salary worth $10.5 million that was considered a trade asset. There were talks that the Cavaliers were trying to flip Haywood to the Los Angeles Clippers for Jamal Crawford or to the Brooklyn Nets for Joe Johnson. At the time, the Cavaliers needed both shooting and wing depth and either Crawford or Johnson would have been perfect additions.\n\nBut, at the time nothing substantial happened on the Haywood trade front for Cleveland. The Cavaliers ultimately ended up sending Haywood, along with Mike Miller and two second-round picks to the Portland Trail Blazers and received a receive $10.5 million and a $2.85 million trade exception. After such lofty expectations, it felt underwhelming for sure to get an exception for Haywood.\n\nThere is a silver lining though as the Cavaliers were able to use part of Haywood’s exception to take on Channing Frye’s contract in a three team trade with the Orlando Magic. At the same time, the Cavaliers created another exception by sending Anderson Varejao to Portland which eventually became Kyle Korver.\n\nFrye was vital in both establishing locker room chemistry as well as the team’s consistent status as a title contender. The same can be said of Korver. The Cavaliers have also used exceptions in the past to acquire players like Timofey Mozgov who made contributions similar to Frye and Korver. So while Haywood’s contract didn’t produce an immediate impact player, the Cavaliers were able to eventually with Frye and eventually Korver.\n\nNevertheless, that's why situations like Smith's and to an extent Haywood's should serve as a cautionary tale for the Cavaliers and their fans. Despite the high value that Cleveland fans put on both contracts, it became clear on two separate occasions that other organizations don't feel the same way. But, there is no rest for the weary. The Cavaliers will likely have to go through this rodeo again this summer and all throughout next season.\n\nOn July 1, the Cavaliers will have five expiring contracts on their payroll. They are Tristan Thompson ($18.5 million), Brandon Knight ($15.6 million), Jordan Clarkson ($13.4 million), John Henson ($9.7 million) and Matthew Dellavedova ($9.6 million). This seems like the perfect storm for the Cavaliers, as there will be plenty of pressure internally and from the fans externally to flip all of these expiring deals for assets. And with how Smith's situation was handled, Cleveland will likely try their hardest to do so. But this time around, fans should temper their expectations.\n\nThompson is the most likely to be traded with the team recently signing Larry Nance Jr. to a four-year, $44.8 million extension and Kevin Love to a four-year, $120 million extension. Financially, it makes zero sense to try and sign Thompson to an extension and commit the majority of their payroll to their big men. After that, Clarkson is almost a guarantee to go thanks to his bench scoring, followed by Knight to a team that could use a bench point guard and finally Henson to a team that needs a reliable big man in the middle.\n\nEasier said than done though for the Cavaliers if history is any indicator. It will be tough to move all of these contracts, and realistically Cleveland probably won't. As long as Cleveland can move a few of them it's a step in the right direction. Even if it ends up being like Haywood's situation, where it can become a more valuable asset down the line. Fans should never count out Altman, as he seems to thrive best whenever he's under pressure and has continuously produced results."
