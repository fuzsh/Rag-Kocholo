        "text": "16-year NBA veteran and former 6th Man of the Year, J.R. Smith, is finally fulfilling his dreams of becoming a college athlete.\n\nSmith was drafted straight out of St. Benedict’s Prep High School with the 18th-pick in the 2004 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets. After a 16-year NBA career, Smith is finally going back to school.\n\nThe two-time NBA champion has enrolled at North Carolina A & T, and is a walk-on freshman on their golf team.\n\n“It’s going to be fun. Obviously different environments from playing in front of 20,000 people to playing in a college golf gallery. But it’s still as nerve-wracking as shooting a free throw in front of 5,000 instead of making a five-foot putt in front of three. So it all correlates the same for me,” Smith told reporters in an online news conference.\n\nThe idea of J.R. Smith playing competitive golf sounds more far-fetched than it actually is. The former McDonald’s All-American has been playing for 12 years. “As being a shooter and with golf, it correlates to trying to hit different shots,” Smith said.\n\nNorth Carolina A & T Aggies Men’s Golf Coach, Richard Watkins confirmed that Smith was an asset. “The performance of my golf team just got a helping hand because the young man in question is definitely a good player,” Watkins commented.\n\nThe Aggies’ first golf match comes September 24-25 at the Black College Coaches Association Invitational in Newnan, Georgia.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE29\n\nLEGIT1\n\nWOW5\n\nLOL2\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK5\n\nShane Lowry raced out to a hot start on Thursday’s opening round of the Open Championship. On Friday, the Irishman was in cruise control and earned himself a two-stroke lead through ten holes when disaster struck.\n\nThe former Open winner hit his tee shot in some high grass, and made an error on his second shot, with the ball shooting left into a gorse bush.\n\nAfter he hit the shot, Lowry blamed a cameraman for the miscue.\n\n“As I was over the ball I could just see you putting your f—kin’ camera up. Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F—k sake!”\n\nHe’d gone on to make double bogey on the hole and is still tied for the lead as things stand.\n\nMore from the 19th Hole\n\nShane Lowry says this prevalent criticism surrounding Rory McIlroy ‘makes his blood boil’\n\nBrandel Chamblee on why he feels Rory’s game ‘deteriorates in the biggest moments‘\n\nTiger Woods aims brutal dig at Colin Montgomerie\n\nNew here?\n\nFind out more about GolfWRX and the GolfWRX forums.\n\nWhile you’re here, check out the latest Three Swing Challenge.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE35\n\nLEGIT10\n\nWOW4\n\nLOL5\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP3\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK25\n\nLIV golfer Tyrrell Hatton has never been shy about voicing his opinion on golf course setups. Back in 2022, the Englishman voiced his displeasure with the hallowed grounds of Augusta National.\n\n“You can hit good shots here and not get any reward for it. It’s unfair at times,” Hatton said. “I don’t agree with that. If you hit a good shot, you should end up near the hole — not short-sided into a bunker because of the slopes that they’ve created and stuff. Yeah, I don’t think it’s a fair test at times, and when you hit good shots and you’re not rewarded for it, it shows.”\n\nThis week, Royal Troon is under fire from Hatton.\n\nAfter his opening round of 73 (+2), he sounded off on the course.\n\n“They didn’t put any tees forward. You can’t reach any of the par-5s on the front nine. Was it 15 or 16, the par-5, you’re hitting a 4-iron off it. Tell me a good par-5 where you’re hitting 4-iron off the tee. There isn’t one.\n\n“Even though they’ve moved the tee back on 17, which I think is a shame, it’s still with the wind today, you’re hitting 5-iron and hoping it can stay on the green. Rory obviously hits it a lot higher and further, and he was hitting 7-iron there. It doesn’t change the fact that it’s a tough hole, and it’s still hard to hit that green. I think it’s a good thing that the wind was playing down because they probably would have left the tee at the back if it was into off the left. Then do you want to watch guys hit 3-wood into a green that’s hard enough to hit with 7-iron?”\n\nHatton is still firmly in the mix prior to his second-round tee time and will look to make a move to get into position for the weekend.\n\nMore from the 19th Hole\n\nShane Lowry says this prevalent criticism surrounding Rory McIlroy ‘makes his blood boil’\n\nBrandel Chamblee on why he feels Rory’s game ‘deteriorates in the biggest moments‘\n\nTiger Woods aims brutal dig at Colin Montgomerie\n\nNew here?\n\nFind out more about GolfWRX and the GolfWRX forums.\n\nWhile you’re here, check out the latest Three Swing Challenge!\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE10\n\nLEGIT4\n\nWOW3\n\nLOL4\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP3\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK34\n\nSince his incredible victory at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No.2, Bryson DeChambeau certainly has a case to be considered one of the biggest stars in golf. The 30-year-old has grown in popularity due to his success on social media and his popular YouTube channel that appeals to the everyday golfer.\n\nDespite the success and current form on the golf course, DeChambeau got off to a tough start at this week’s Open Championship. The LIV golfer opened with a +5 first round at Royal Troon and struggled to get the wind right all day.\n\nAfter the round, Bryson spoke to the media about his struggles, initially blaming his equipment.\n\n“I’m not at 190 ball speed, so particularly when I’m hitting driver or 3-wood, those clubs are built for around that speed, that 190 ball speed, and my 3-wood around 180, so colder, firmer conditions the golf ball is not compressing as much.\n\nMore from the 19th Hole\n\nShane Lowry says this prevalent criticism surrounding Rory McIlroy ‘makes his blood boil’\n\nBrandel Chamblee on why he feels Rory’s game ‘deteriorates in the biggest moments‘\n\nTiger Woods aims brutal dig at Colin Montgomerie\n\nNew here?\n\nFind out more about GolfWRX and the GolfWRX forums.\n\nWhile you’re here, check out the latest Three Swing Challenge!\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE4\n\nLEGIT1\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP3\n\nOB1\n\nSHANK11"
