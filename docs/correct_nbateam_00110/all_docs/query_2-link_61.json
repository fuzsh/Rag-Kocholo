        "text": "[jwplayer 5F1r2EyF-z6KDnl0B]\n\nAlthough Carmelo Anthony has gotten most of the attention with regards to friends of LeBron James who are currently not in the National Basketball Association, a key member of his most recent championship also currently finds himself without a job in the world’s best league. After J.R. Smith spent most of last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers in exile after playing only five games with the Cavs clearly tanking, the artist known as J.R. Swish has yet to be signed by another team.\n\nSmith spent the Labor Day weekend in Los Angeles playing with LeBron, but former Cavaliers assistant coach and current Lakers assistant Phil Handy had a message for several teams about J.R. Smith and why he should be on a team.\n\nLeBron, as well as Kevin Love, echoed Handy’s support for Swish. (via Cavaliers Nation)\n\nThe Lakers currently have the maximum amount of 20 players currently on their roster heading into training camp, including the injured DeMarcus Cousins and Dwight Howard’s non-guaranteed contract. Smith may be an interesting name to watch for the Lakers should a spot on the roster open up given LeBron’s support, as well as having an ally on the coaching staff in Handy."
