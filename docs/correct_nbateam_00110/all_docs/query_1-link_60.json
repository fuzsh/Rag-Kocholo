        "text": "Once J.R. Smith determined his recent pursuits would make compelling fodder for a docuseries, one of his first calls was to former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate LeBron James. Smith, who played 16 seasons in the NBA before becoming a collegiate golfer, pitched James on a story about dealing with adversity not just as an athlete, but also in the classroom.\n\n“I still remember in third grade when a teacher asked me to stand up and read in front of the class,” Smith said. “I knew from that day that I wasn’t like everybody else.”\n\nSmith’s lifelong battle with dyslexia and ADHD, along with the recent challenges he’s faced on the golf course, is featured in “Redefined: J.R. Smith,” a four-part docuseries presented by Prime Video Sports and produced by Uninterrupted that will premiere April 4. James and Maverick Carter, who co-founded Uninterrupted, were among the project’s executive producers.\n\nThe 37-year-old Smith is now in his sophomore season at North Carolina A&T, a historically black university. He’s one of seven golfers on the Aggies’ roster, and the oldest by more than a few years. In the spring of 2004, Smith had committed to North Carolina before ultimately opting to forgo college and declare for the NBA Draft. The Freehold Borough, N.J., native was selected directly out of high school by the Hornets with the 18th overall pick that year.\n\nNearly 20 years later, Smith has reprioritized education. As a freshman last year, he earned a 4.0 grade-point average and was named the Aggies’ Academic Athlete of the Year after walking on to the men’s golf team.\n\nNothing about the experience has been a layup, though. Smith said he had essentially no golf experience prior to 2010, when Basketball Hall of Famer Moses Malone — also a former preps-to-pros NBA star — encouraged him to participate in a charity golf event. Smith played a lot in the years that followed, but never competed.\n\n“It’s different when you’re out there playing with your boys versus when you’re trying to win a tournament,” he said.\n\nIn the classroom, Smith’s flawless GPA doesn’t tell the full story. The workload has been daunting, and his learning disabilities are still a daily fight. He’s grown comfortable talking about them publicly only after years of therapy.\n\n“When me and [my therapist] started unpacking everything and discussing what I would have to do to get to where I could have the type of impact that I want, that’s when we came up with the concept of evolving over your fears,” Smith said, “which is what the documentary is really about.”\n\nDespite Smith’s on-court successes — he averaged 12.4 points per game, was named Sixth Man of the Year in 2012-13 and won two NBA titles — he said the insecurities he faced when he was younger continued to hold a grip.\n\n“I want to show people that you can overcome your fears and be successful, but you have to take that first step,” said Smith, who said he had plenty of creative control during the project as the docuseries’ producers strove for authenticity. “That’s what I felt like I did, was take the first step of going back to school.”"
