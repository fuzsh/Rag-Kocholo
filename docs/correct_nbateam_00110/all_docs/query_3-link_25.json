        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA pure scorer. Can dominate going to the hoop (with fantastic leaping and dunking ability) or hitting from beyond the arc (with top-tier range). His passing is underrated and he flashes a knack for steals. A phenomenal athlete with explosiveness and uncommon skill. Heats up in a hurry. Can carry a team for one game and disappear the next. His defensive effort has been challenged by his coaches. Sometimes goes for the flashy play instead of the efficient one. Plays out of control sometimes. Occasionally gets into trouble, both on and off the court."
