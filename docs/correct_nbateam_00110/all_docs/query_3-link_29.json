        "text": "Prime Video Sports dropped the first episodes of a new series featuring a well-known HBCU student-athlete.\n\nRedefined: J.R. Smith, a four-part UNINTERRUPTED docuseries following the retired NBA star as he pursues a college education and new athletic passion at North Carolina A&T.\n\nThe docuseries premiered Tuesday exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.\n\nThe docuseries following Smith is a powerful reminder that one can overcome even the most brutal setbacks and achieve success with determination and resilience.\n\nDrafted to the NBA straight out of high school at 19 years old, Smith suddenly finds himself without an NBA team to call home and is searching to redefine his life and career.\n\nThe series picks up with Smith as he sets a new intention for himself, getting a college education and pursuing a new athletic passion as a member of the men’s golf team at North Carolina A&T, the nation’s most prominent HBCU.\n\nSmith shared his perspective of what it means to attend an HBCU at this chapter in his life.\n\n“I mean, to be able to like to do it at an HBCU is everything because kids who look like me and grew up like me get to see me, a person of quote-unquote a large following who hasn’t always been in the good eye of the following, from the public eye anyway,” Smith told Hypebeast about the project. “And for them to see me taking my education seriously, I think it only emphasizes more for them, and I can be the role model I want to be.\n\n“And I think they perceive it well. So around campus and stuff is great; I can’t complain, honestly. It’s a great group of people and a great place.”"
