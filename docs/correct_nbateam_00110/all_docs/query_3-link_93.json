        "text": "J.R. Smith is one of the new guys on a team in flux.\n\nHis focus is playing hard and bringing energy to the floor, the new Cavaliers guard said.\n\nBut, of course, this is J.R. Smith. He will do something else, too.\n\n“When in doubt, my motto is, ‘shoot the ball,’ ” Smith said before making his Cavaliers debut during Wednesday’s 105-93 loss to Houston at Quicken Loans Arena. “So, when in doubt, I’m going to shoot it.”\n\nSome people associated with the Cavs may read that comment and smile. Some might get chills from fear.\n\nSmith brings a gunner’s reputation and a history of strange behavior to the Cavs after Monday’s three-team trade that centered around Dion Waiters going to Oklahoma City and Smith and Iman Shumpert coming to Cleveland from the Knicks.\n\nOne thing is certain: Smith is not boring.\n\nA reporter mentioned that Smith was known to be “colorful,” to which Smith said, “I think that’s just the tattoos.”\n\nAnother reporter mentioned that new teammate Shawn Marion believes Smith should not have been fined $50,000 for untying the shoes of Marion and Detroit’s Greg Monroe during games last season.\n\nSmith did not hesitate, answering with a smile, “He should have paid half of it then.”\n\nThe 29-year-old Smith was charming and thoughtful with media Wednesday, which belies his sometimes erratic behavior on and off the court.\n\nWhile the Cavs gave consideration of the risk Smith’s presence could be in the locker room, general manger David Griffin believes any worries are unfounded.\n\n“There’s always concern when you’re adding any piece to your locker room, let alone a piece that’s been, let’s call it, volatile in his career,” Griffin said. “... One of the things we heard from everybody — players that played with him, coaches that coached him — his issues have never been as a teammate. He competes. And his teammates like him because he lays it on the line for them. That’s not been his issue. Does he take too many shots sometimes in the wrong places? Absolutely. A lot of players do that and have done that. But J.R. comes to battle. He competes on a consistent basis. That was something that mattered to us.”\n\nSmith struggled shooting the ball in his Cleveland debut. He was 0-for-5, although three of the misses were tough clock-related attempts. A career 37.0 percent shooter from the arc, Smith seems to be a good fit to play with LeBron James once the four-time MVP returns from injury.\n\n“I think it will be great,” said Smith, who mentioned that he has a good relationship with James since they are both Dallas Cowboys fans. “For a person that can space the floor, they really can’t double, they really can’t help that much. We’ve got shooters all around. When he does kick the ball, (I’ll) just try to make something happen with it.”\n\nSmith said he felt mixed emotions when he heard he was traded to Cleveland. He hated to uproot his family and say goodbye to friends from playing the past 3 1/2 seasons in New York. But the opportunity to go from a team with the worst record in the NBA to one with championship aspirations is exciting for Smith, whose debut came as news of the Cavs acquiring Denver center Timofey Mozgov was developing.\n\n“I believe we can be one of the best teams in the league, if not the best,” Smith said. “It’s just going to take a lot of hard work and dedication from each and everyone of us. A lot of buying in. We’ve got the big fella coming from Denver. It will be a great team to watch.”\n\nSmith, the 2012-13 NBA Sixth Man of the Year when he averaged 18.1 points a game for New York, will play in a reserve role as of now, according to Cavs head coach David Blatt.\n\nBlatt had dinner with Smith and Shumpert on Tuesday night and came away impressed. He does not seem concerned about any kind of attitude problem with Smith.\n\n“I think you can just look a guy in the eye and you get a sense for what his feeling is about being in a new situation and about suddenly a change,” Blatt said. “… J.R. is a guy that a lot of our guys know. They have a lot of good things to say about him.”\n\nWAITING ON SHUMP\n\nShumpert, who came to the Cavaliers along with J.R. Smith from the Knicks in Monday’s trade, is at least two weeks away from making his Cleveland debut. Shumpert dislocated his left shoulder Dec. 12 and has not played since.\n\n“He will begin doing therapy that is not contact related,” Griffin said. “He was doing contact (drills) in New York. Our medical staff feels like that was a little aggressive. So we’re going to try to get him to a point where we get him through practices before he sees game action, but we do anticipate that he’s two to three weeks away.”\n\nShumpert, who was in town earlier Wednesday, did not speak to reporters.\n\nSO LONG, DION\n\nKyrie Irving said he had not reached out to Waiters yet since Monday’s trade. The relationship between the two was a constant source of speculation with the thought that Waiters was jealous of the attention Irving received.\n\nIrving spoke highly of Waiters on Wednesday.\n\n“He’s truly a talent, truly a tremendous teammate,” Irving said. “I’m just happy he’s in a situation he can thrive (in). It’s just part of the business at this point. It’s out of our control. I’m happy he’s happy and hope he does well in OKC.”\n\nSaid Kevin Love about Waiters, “I was a fan of Dion. (I) sat next to him on the plane — good laughs. I enjoyed having him as a teammate.”\n\nLeBron James said he hates losing “brothers” through the business of basketball. Lou Amundson and Alex Kirk also were part of Monday’s three-team trade, and point guard A.J. Price was waived for the second time this season Wednesday.\n\nAbout Waiters specifically, James said, “It sucks that it just didn’t work out for him here on this team. We wish him the best in OKC.”\n\nHIGH SCHOOL TIES\n\nIrving, 22, attended St. Patrick High School in New Jersey, while the 29-year-old Smith attended nearby Saint Benedict’s Preparatory.\n\n“I don’t really like Saint Benedict’s, but I’m happy to have him as my teammate, as well as Shumpert,” Irving said. “They bring a lot to the table. I’m looking forward to them both being healthy and giving us a different edge going forward.”\n\nSaid Smith about Irving, “Even though he’s a St. Pat’s guy, Kyrie is a Jersey kid, so I’ll give him his little credit.”\n\nCavs forward Tristan Thompson is a native of Canada but played part of his high school career at Saint Benedict’s as well.\n\nReach Josh at 330-580-8426 or josh.weir@cantonrep.com"
