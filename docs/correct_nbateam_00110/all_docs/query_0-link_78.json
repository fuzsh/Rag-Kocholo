        "text": "The Petcash Post is a daily brief that breaks down the business of athletes, sports, and NIL.\n\nJoin 24,435 others and get exclusive access to the newsletter üîë ‚Äî it‚Äôs free!\n\nThis past weekend I was watching the Masters and they did a wonderful feature on JR Smith and his transition from the NBA to college golf.\n\nIt got me interested in a few things:\n\nWhat has JR‚Äôs career looked like as a businessman?\n\nWhat motivated him to become a student-athlete again?\n\nAre there any NIL implications or interest from brands?\n\nDoes he have future plans in golf and life?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve found is quite interesting (and compelling).\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down üëá\n\nSome Background Info\n\nJ.R. Smith grew up in Clarksburg, New Jersey and attended 3 different high schools before transferring to Saint Benedict‚Äôs Preparatory School.\n\nHe played football, basketball, and baseball during his high school years, but eventually decided to focus solely on basketball because he believed it was the greatest path for his career.\n\nIn 2004, Smith declared for the NBA Draft. He did so after reneging on a commitment to play for coach Roy Williams at UNC.\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets (now the Pelicans) drafted Smith as the 18th pick in the first round. He signed a 3-year, $3.1 million deal.\n\nHe immediately made an impact winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month three times, however, his relationship with the head coach deteriorated and was traded to the Bulls and then the Nuggets within a 7 day span.\n\nJR played a crucial role for the Nuggets consistently being in contention for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year and also the Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nOver the years, he would play for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls (China) and then for the New York Knicks.\n\nLater, he teamed up with Lebron James and followed him to a championship in Cleveland and another one with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020.\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA in 2021, JR Smith made a unique move back to college.\n\nBut what fueled this?\n\nJR‚Äôs Motivation\n\nSmith was never a superstar in the NBA, but he still made a lucrative living during his 15 years in the league.\n\nThroughout his career, Smith earned more than $90 million in salary alone.\n\nHe‚Äôs also enjoyed an array of endorsement deals, including one with American clothing brand Supreme‚Äîa deal that sparked an unusual dispute between Smith and the NBA over a leg tattoo that ran afoul of intellectual property policies.\n\nDespite a very successful NBA tenure that included making over $90 million, he regrets spending so much of that money in a materialistic way, and wishes he had given back more to those less fortunate.\n\n‚ÄúI felt like I had everything, but I still wasn‚Äôt whole with me, because I knew there was something missing,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so trained, so embedded to have an egocentric mindset, to worry about myself, worry about me, worry about mine. When you make over $100 million in your career, is giving $5 or $10 million going to change your lifestyle?‚Äù\n\nSmith didn‚Äôt realize that his materialistic spending was a problem until after he walked away from the NBA.\n\n‚ÄúAthletes make their schools‚Ä¶ millions and millions over again‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut the $50,000 to $100,000 you give to HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) ‚Äî it changes lives.‚Äù\n\nAnd this new mindset is what launched JR Smith into possibly his greatest achievement to date.\n\nJR Smith Takes on College and NIL\n\nSince he never went to college, JR saw immense value in coming back as a student-athlete.\n\nHe decided to enroll at HBCU North Carolina A&T and was cleared to play golf in August.\n\nIn his college debut, he birdied 2 of the first 5 holes and ended up finishing the tournament at 29 over. This landed him in 81st place.\n\nBeing a former NBA star comes with a lot of publicity and excitement for brands in the golf world.\n\nSmith signed a deal with Excel Sports for NIL representation earlier this year and is looking to earn endorsement opportunities under the NCAA's new name, image, and likeness parameters.\n\nIt's understandable that companies are looking to take advantage of Smith's celebrity ‚Äî he has taken the golf world by storm during his time at North Carolina A&T.\n\nDespite this interest, there are no publicly disclosed deals.\n\nKeep in mind that under the NCAA‚Äôs rules, Smith can't promote his sponsors at NCAA-sanctioned events, but he can appear in commercials and make references to his affiliation on social media.\n\nOne of the hardest things about NIL (especially in golf) is that many of the deals will be with apparel or equipment companies.\n\nFor example, Adidas can‚Äôt sign JR to a deal since North Carolina A&T is Nike. It would be hard for TaylorMade to do a deal with JR since he can‚Äôt promote it during any matches or events.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nJR Smith has big plans for the future.\n\nHe plans on playing golf all summer and coming back next year improved. One of his goals is to play a round with Tiger Woods to receive some feedback.\n\nBasketball players are arguably the best athletes in the world and the transition to golf is a logical one. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that if JR sticks with it he could be a major force across the collegiate golf space.\n\nWhile golf is going great, one of JR‚Äôs best achievements is his 4.0 GPA.\n\nHis emotion in this video says it all:\n\nHappy Monday. I hope you had a great weekend!\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt answered these 9 questions, please do so as it helps me write content that you‚Äôre interested in (answers are anonymous).\n\nGoogle Form (9 Quick Questions)\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/30/jr-smith-supreme-tattoo-nba-rules\n\nhttps://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/j-r-smith-commits-to-unc\n\nhttps://www.sportscasting.com/jr-smith-regrets-spent-90-million-nba-fortune/\n\nhttps://www.essence.com/news/jr-smith-ncat/"
