Smith will best be known as an eccentric individual whose penchant for bad on-court decision-making cost his team a Finals Game, but he was still a coveted role player for years who won two NBA Championships; Cleveland in 2016 and Los Angeles in 2020.\n\nSmith’s individual highlights include finishing in the top ten four times in 3-Point Field Goals, winning the 2013 Sixth Man of the Year, and earning three consecutive Rookie of the Month Awards in 2005. He won’t make the Hall, but he is more famous than many who did."
