        "text": "On the night of November 26, 2008, a kid named Pat had 8 hours to kill between basketball practice and his flight home from college for Thanksgiving. Most students had already left campus earlier that week and his teammates had all left for home after that evening’s practice. Pat was pretty much the only person on campus. So he went to the fridge, called-upon his buddy Keith Stone, turned on some ghetto hip-hop and decided to start a season on NBA 2K9.\n\nPat fancied himself a great video game General Manager — thus, he decided to draft his team. He picked the Warriors as his team — he appreciated coach Don Nelson’s “Run & Gun” mentality on offense and laissez-fair approach to defense. His team ended up with the 29th pick in the draft and no chance at a star like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, etc. Pat watched as the top players and many of the talented youngsters came off the draft board. Finally, it was his turn to pick . . .\n\nNo one really knows what exactly transpired over the next hour of drafting, but the results were both horrifying and legendary. If the draft had been made public, Pat may have been lobotomized. For years, people have speculated as to what went through his mind that night.\n\nFinally, nearly 8 years after that fateful night, Pat decided to break the silence and come clean about the formation of the All Get Mine Team.\n\nRound 1 — Michael Beasley a/k/a “B-Eazy”\n\n“I loved B-Eazy’s bucket-getting ability first and foremost. I also loved the fact that the virtual Beasley couldn’t possibly wake-n-bake as often as the real life Beasley.”\n\nRound 2 — Stephen Jackson a/k/a “Captain Jack”\n\n“I needed a leader — the type of guy who would have his teammate’s back if said teammate ran into the stands and started punching fans. Sure he might fire a gun off at a strip club every now and then, but hey, Tim Duncan once called him the ‘ultimate teammate’ and Fat Joe had his back. That was good enough for me.”\n\nRound 3 — Zach Randolph a/k/a “Z-Bo”\n\n“Who doesn’t love them some Z-Bo? Other teams were worried about his affinity with strip clubs. Whatevs — I wanted my guys at strip clubs. First off, they have excellent buffets and I wanted my players to be well-nourished. Second, the more money they blow at strip clubs, the harder they’ll play for that next big contract.”\n\nRound 4— Ben Gordon\n\n“Ben Gordon invented the 3 Monocle….’nuff said.”\n\nRound 5— JR Smith a/k/a “Pipe”\n\n“They say a DM is worth 1,000 words . . . .”\n\n[Virtual Doris Burke interviewing a slightly intoxicated Pat]:\n\nDB: So Pat, at this point, your roster consists of Michael Beasley, Stephen Jackson, Zach Randolph, Ben Gordon, and JR Smith — are you at all concerned with the mercurial nature of these players?\n\nP: No.\n\nDB: Do you know what the word “mercurial” means?\n\nP: Next question.\n\nDB: Are you concerned that none of your players pass very often — if at all?\n\nP: Last time I checked, you can’t get an assist without a guy puttin’ the ball in the bucket. That’s what my team specializes in — gettin’ buckets and throwin’ suck-its.\n\nDB: Last question before we let you get back to drafting, are you concerned with some of your players’ off-the-court issues?\n\nP: Listen, unless NBA 2K9 has added strip clubs, weed, and snitches to its “Season Mode”, then I ain’t worried ‘bout nothin’!\n\nRound 6 — Stephon Marbury a/k/a “Starbury”\n\n“Hey, if you’re crazy enough to live stream yourself eating Vaseline, then you’ll always have a spot on the All Get Mine Team.”\n\nRound 7 — Tim Thomas a/k/a “The Mailbox”\n\n“Not gonna lie — I made up that nickname, but it’s a fitting one. Tim Thomas had a bad rap for mailing-it-in and was a regular member of the All Postage Stamp Team (cudos to Bill Simmons). But ya know what? If you were talented enough to make nearly $100 million over 12 years in your chosen profession without trying hard — then more power to you. Plus, he sometimes wore a double-headband.”\n\nRound 8 — Ricky Davis a/k/a “Get Buckets”\n\n“His nickname alone guaranteed ole’ slick Rick a spot on the squad. If that wasn’t enough, Ricky Davis is the protagonist in 2 of the greatest “Get Mine” moments in history. First, he once berated a rookie LeBron James for not passing him the ball enough and later had the following to tell reporters:\n\n“I thought LeBron James was just going to be another addition to help me score.” ~ Ricky Davis\n\n“And second, he once shot the ball off his own team’s basket to try to get the final rebound he needed for a triple-double — the epitome of the ‘Get Mine’ mentality.”\n\nRound 9 — Bonzi Wells\n\n“We couldn’t only have 1 member of the Jail Blazers on the team (Z-Bo). Plus, I didn’t have to worry about virtual Bonzi complaining about the team’s fans.”\n\nRound 10 — Chris Andersen a/k/a “Birdman”\n\n“Two words: Neck tattoos. Love ’em. You get a neck tattoo and you’re relegated to being a professional athlete, drug dealer, or rapper . . . and that’s it. If you’re that confident in yourself, I want you on my team. Birdman got suspended from the NBA for 2 years for abusing hard drugs. During his suspension, he doubled-down on himself and got a massive ‘Free Bird’ tattoo on his neck. Welcome home Birdman, welcome home.”\n\nRound 11 — Sebastian Telfair a/k/a “Bassy”\n\n“Bassy is actually Starbury’s cousin — people forget that. We keep it in the family on the All Get Mine Team.”\n\nRound 12 — Eddie House a/k/a “Casa”\n\n“Love Eddie Casa — how can you not love a guy that dropped 61 points in a game at Arizona State?”\n\nRound 13 — Bill Walker a/k/a “Wild Bill”\n\n“Before he started tearing his ACLs, Wild Bill was the greatest dunker in high school basketball history — pretty sure he threw down a windmill every time he dunked. Just watch him.”\n\nRound 14 — Ronald Murray a/k/a “Flip”\n\n“Game Over.”\n\nRound 15 — Darius Miles a/k/a “D-Miles”\n\n“I needed at least 1 guy who could play some defense and D-Miles was great at stealing things — like the SAT in that cinematic masterpiece The Perfect Score.”\n\nWhen he got back from Thanksgiving Break, Pat played about 9–10 games against the computer — winning all of them by 20+ and scoring 130+ per game. A couple of his buddies happened upon him playing these games and were baffled by the success of this gimmicky playing style. From that point forward, Pat only played against humans. He took on all challengers and systematically laid waste to every one of them.\n\nThe regular season came to a close and the All Get Mine Team finished with a 28–1 record. After averaging a league-leading 37ppg, JR Smith took home MVP and 6th Man of the Year honors. Michael Beasley won Rookie of the Year after posting a 26/12 stat line. The 6 aforementioned 3-point shooters all averaged double-figures as well.\n\nThe All Get Mine Team continued its torrid run through the first 3 rounds of the playoffs — sweeping each series. However, Pat’s adversaries had improved dramatically — 1 in particular (we’ll call him “Tim” to protect his likeness), came increasingly close to upsetting the All Get Mine Team.\n\nThe Finals would feature the All Get Mine Team versus a LeBron James-led Pistons squad that had the 3-point shooters to match them shot-for-shot. Tim happily grabbed the joysticks for Games 1–3.\n\n“I know I said JR Smith was the greatest video game player ever in NBA 2K9 — I was wrong — LeBron was utterly unstoppable, especially against the matador defense of the All Get Mine Team. Pretty certain he had 108 points in Game 1. Somehow we pulled off a stunning, come-from-behind, 1-point victory in triple-overtime with Ben Gordon hitting a heavily-contested 3-pointer at the buzzer (my memory is both a blessing and a curse). It was awesome — but I knew that we were going to lose some games in that series after Game 1. They had exposed another loophole in the game — no one could steal the ball off LeBron and, if you were patient enough on drives, he could get you a dunk (and often an And-1) on every single play.”\n\n“Game 2 was another overtime classic featuring an at-the-buzzer shot — this time by Jose Calderon for the Pistons (I couldn’t tell you what I did last weekend, but I remember this like it happened yesterday). LeBron had like 92 points. JR Smith had 79. It was the first time the All Get Mine Team had lost since Thanksgiving.”"
