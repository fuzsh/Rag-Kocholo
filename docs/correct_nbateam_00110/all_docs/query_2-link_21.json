        "text": "JR Smith, the newest member of Team Oakley, shares family, golf, and partnership with Oakley. This former professional basketball player, who re-enrolled in college at 36 to pursue his passions for golf and education, exemplifies the power of ambition and resilience. Beyond his athletic and academic pursuits, Smith’s journey is marked by a deep understanding of eye health’s critical role in achieving excellence in sports and life. His collaboration with Oakley underscores a mutual dedication to enhancing vision protection and performance for athletes worldwide. Moreover, Smith’s impact extends into his community, where he actively engages in initiatives that inspire and support young athletes to chase their dreams, prioritize their health, and value their education. Dive into the story of JR Smith and discover how his partnership with Oakley and his community involvement are shaping the future of sports and making a lasting difference in the lives of many.\n\nIn Partnership with EssilorLuxottica\n\nWhat’s Covered?\n\nFrom Competitive Sports to Family Values\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nGreetings, fellow optometry enthusiasts, and welcome to Defocus Media, the leading podcast in optometry. Here, we explore the most compelling topics, cutting-edge technology, stylish eyewear, practice management, and more. So, sit back, relax, and let’s defocus.\n\nHello, everyone! It’s your favorite optometrist, Dr. Darryl Glover. Today, I’m thrilled to have a real star with us. What’s happening, my friend?\n\nJR Smith:\n\nI’m good. How about you?\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nI’m doing fantastic, thank you. Today, we’re chatting with JR Smith, a name many of you recognize as an NBA champion and a golfer among his many talents. For those who may not be as familiar with JR Smith, would you mind sharing your background and how you ventured into sports?\n\nJR Smith:\n\nI was born and raised in New Jersey. I’ve been engrossed in football, basketball, and baseball all my life. Being one of six siblings, there’s always been a strong sense of competition in the family, especially being the eldest brother—I couldn’t let my younger siblings outdo me.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nBeing one of six siblings sounds like competitiveness is in your nature.\n\nJR Smith:\n\nIt’s something innate. My father was one of nine children, with four boys among them, which only added to the competitive atmosphere. Practically all my aunts and uncles have at least four or five children, so our family is quite large. This environment of competition extended to nearly every sport—football, baseball, basketball—you name it. Whether it was catching up to someone or having someone try to catch up to me, it was a constant challenge. Those family reunions were quite the spectacle.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nIt must have been exciting, especially the family pickup games.\n\nJR Smith:\n\nOh, definitely. Those games were a major part of our family gatherings until I was around 14 or 15 years old.\n\nThe Power of Partnership: JR Smith and Oakley’s Impactful Collaboration\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nI’d love to dive into basketball stories with you, but I’m more curious about your golf journey and partnership with Oakley. Seeing you decked out in Oakley gear always catches my eye. Tell me more about how this partnership came about and what its impact was on your life.\n\nJR Smith:\n\nSeveral brands were interested in partnering with me, but I needed to know who was truly invested in the community and eager to address systemic issues. Oakley stood out by providing products, offering innovative ideas, and encouraging more community involvement. This partnership has exceeded my expectations. Talking about inclusivity is trendy now, but Oakley is about taking action and making a difference.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nAbsolutely, it’s about putting your money where your mouth is and seeing real action.\n\nTransitioning from the Basketball Court to the Golf Course\n\nJR Smith:\n\nExactly. Oakley has supported my diverse interests—basketball, golf, snowboarding, and more. They’re not limited to one sport or activity; they cater to a broad range of interests, from gaming to mountain biking. This versatility is what I love most about Oakley; they provide a platform that supports various passions, which is vital for inspiring the youth.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nThat’s incredible, the way an iconic brand like Oakley can offer the perfect solution for any activity—whether you’re in the classroom, on the field, or in the gym. It becomes a part of who you are, a part of your DNA, which is truly remarkable. Shifting gears a bit, I want to touch on golf. My father, who has passed away, was a big golf enthusiast. Playing a whole round with him was a profound moment in my life. Golf is notoriously challenging, and your transition from basketball to golf is particularly fascinating to me. It reminds me a bit of Michael Jordan moving from basketball to baseball. Can you share how this transition occurred, especially at North Carolina A&T, and what sparked your interest in golf?\n\nJR Smith:\n\nMy experience at A&T has been incredible. The support from students and the community has been overwhelming. It’s amusing to think I’m the oldest on the golf course now, when I used to be the youngest on the basketball court.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nIt’s quite a shift, from being the youngest on the court to now being the oldest on the field.\n\nJR Smith:\n\nAbsolutely, it’s a bit of a twist. I was the youngest player on my team for the first seven or eight years in the NBA, and now, I’m the eldest in golf. But being the “OG” has its perks. I get to share life experiences and knowledge, which is much more meaningful than just providing financial support. Giving my time and engaging directly with the community and the younger players has been really rewarding.\n\nThe Impact of Golf on Personal Growth and Community\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nIt’s truly remarkable to see how mentoring and getting to know these young individuals can have such a profound impact, not only on them but also on yourself. It sounds like it’s been a transformative experience for you, enhancing how you function as a father, spouse, brother, and son. Partnering with Oakley to give back to them, considering all they’ve done for you, is a testament to your growth.\n\nSo, how did your interest in golf ignite? Was it something you picked up from your peers?\n\nJR Smith:\n\nActually, yes, in a way. I was in Houston with Rashard Lewis, another former NBA player. He was an incredible shooter and introduced me to golf at his foundation event. Initially, I had no interest, but he invited me to show support. My upbringing emphasized the importance of giving back, especially to someone I respected like a big brother. It was at this event that I met Moses Malone, who truly introduced me to golf. Despite my hesitation, his encouragement led me to take a swing, and just like that, I was hooked.\n\nThe Role of Eyewear in Enhancing Athletic Performance\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nIt’s amazing how a single experience can spark such a passion. Now, with your partnership with Oakley, I’m curious about the eyewear technology that aids your game. What makes the Oakley frames you wear so effective?\n\nJR Smith:\n\nMy awareness of eye care was minimal until I realized three of my daughters needed glasses. Through them, I learned the importance of proper vision. Initially, I didn’t wear sunglasses while playing, but partnering with Oakley changed that. Wearing their sunglasses, I’ve noticed a significant difference in my game, especially in spotting the ball, reading the greens, and tracking the ball’s flight. It’s been a game-changer, allowing me to see more clearly and perform better on the course.\n\nIndeed, realizing the stark contrast in visibility with the right eyewear compared to my previous skepticism has been a game-changer. The difference is like night and day, significantly improving my performance, especially around the greens and with putting. Hitting the correct lines is crucial, and the lens technology has been a tremendous help.\n\nJR Smith:\n\nAbsolutely, the improvement in my game thanks to the lens technology is undeniable. And the comfort? That’s been a revelation. I used to struggle with sunglasses causing pressure points, but with Oakley’s design, especially the Oakley Frogskins and BiSphaera, I barely notice I’m wearing them. They fit like a glove and stay put during swings, which was a concern of mine.\n\nDr. Darryl Glover:\n\nComfort is critical, especially as we get older and value it more. It’s good to hear that Oakley is addressing these issues and that you’re developing solutions."
