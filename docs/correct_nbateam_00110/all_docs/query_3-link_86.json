        "text": "\"I'm not doing this to prove nobody else wrong... I'm really proving to myself that I can do it.\" Amazon has unveiled an official trailer for a compelling new sports documentary series titled Redefined: J.R. Smith, made by filmmaker Philip Knowlton. The four-part series coming to Prime Video soon is about an athlete shifting from one sport to another. J.R. Smith, the two-time NBA champion (for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers) who's gotten \"a lot of ink\"\" for changing his focus from basketball to golf, is the subject of this doc. Redefined: J.R. Smith will follow the retired player as he pursues a college education and new athletic passion – golf – at North Carolina A&T. At the age of 19, after being selected in the NBA draft, finds himself without a team to call his own and is looking to redefine his future. The series comes from LeBron James and Maverick Carter as executive producers at their Uninterrupted banner. This looks like an inspiring story about following your passions & fighting for your place, no matter who you are. Check it out.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Amazon's series Redefined: J.R. Smith, direct from YouTube:"
