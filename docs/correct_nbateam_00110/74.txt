J.R. Smith is a former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He played high school basketball at Saint Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark.

Smith was selected by the New Orleans Hornets with the 18th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft and went on to play for several teams, including the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers.

He won two NBA championships, with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020.

Siblings

J.R. has three brothers and two sisters.

His younger brother Chris Smith briefly played alongside him on the New York Knicks in 2013-14.

Chris faced criticism from Knicks fans for making the team’s roster, with some believing it was due to his connection to J.R. rather than his own merit.

However, Chris said he felt he earned his spot.

The Knicks were criticized for signing Chris to a guaranteed contract, which was seen as an attempt to appease J.R. rather than a basketball decision.

Chris had a difficult time establishing himself in the NBA and was eventually released by the Knicks.

He struggled with the negative media attention and feeling neglected by some teammates after being cut.

J.R. has been supportive of his brother Chris and believes teams may have been hesitant to sign him due to the media scrutiny in New York, though J.R. also felt Chris needed to put in more work.

Despite the challenges, J.R. has maintained a positive relationship with his brother and continues to support him in his basketball endeavors.
