Hundreds of thousands of Yemeni children do not receive education under governmental supervision, said the Yemeni prime minister.

Abdul Qadir Bajamal was addressing a gathering organised by the ministry of education to honour prominent teachers on Teacher's Day.

He estimated the number of students who receive education in these underground religious schools at 330,000. "With the teachers, we will confront the reactionary and backward culture in Marran and Al Muzamat mountains," Bajamal said in reference to the areas where a two-week rebellion was put down last week. These secret schools take an extreme approach of the religion, but that is not the biggest issue.

"Our biggest problem is illiteracy. We are suffering from political and knowledge and cultural illiteracy."

Illiteracy in Yemen, estimated at about 60 per cent, is among the highest in the Arab world. He criticised the medical and educational syndicates, dominated by the opposition Islah party.

"We have not heard any one of them asking for laboratories or technical support for schools. All that they demand is a pay rise as if they were syndicates of porters."

Bajamal warned of dividing education on a sectarian basis, saying "this division will only tear and damage the homeland".

Bajamal also ordered the ministry to bring all kinds of education under its authority and supervision.

"We are not against religious education. We are free people, but we are against extremism, fanaticism, tribalism and sectarianism."
