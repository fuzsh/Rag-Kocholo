rank #1 ·

Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi (1920–7 July 1981) (Arabic: قحطان محمد الشعبي‎) was the first President of the People's Republic of South Yemen. Al-Shaabi's National Liberation Front (NLF) political organisation wrested control of the country from the British and won political supremacy over the opposition Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) in 1967. On 30 November 1967, the protectorate of South Arabia was declared independent as the People's Republic of South Yemen with al-Shaabi as President. Al-Shaabi held the presidency until 22 June 1969, when a hard-line Marxist group from within his own NLF seized control. He was replaced by Salim Rubai Ali (Salmin) and jailed, then placed under house arrest until the 1970s, and lived quietly in Aden from his release until his death in 1981.

Salim Rubai Ali (Arabic: سالم ربيع علي; ca. 1935 – 26 June 1978) was the head of state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) from 22 June 1969 until his surrender and execution by firing squad on 26 June 1978. Rubai Ali led the left wing of the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (NF), which forced the British to withdraw from South Arabia on 29 November 1967. Rubai Ali's radicals gained dominance over the more moderate President Qahtan al-Shaabi's elements, allowing Rubai Ali to seize power; he retained the title of Chairman of the Presidential Council throughout his term, even as the NF changed the name of the country from the People's Republic of South Yemen to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1970.
