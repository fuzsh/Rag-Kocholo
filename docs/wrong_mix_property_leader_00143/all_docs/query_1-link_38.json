Subsequently, the whole family of Al-Habib Umar leave Lisk towards the village of Al-Huraidhah. When the group arrived at the village Manwab, then Al-Habib Umar said: “Should you proceed to Huraidhah, because I wanted to stop in a place my wife in this village”. The group then went on his way to the village of Al-Huraidhah, while the Al-Habib Umar stopped and settled in the village Manwab for one week.\n\nAl-Habib Abdul Rahman father of Al-Habib Umar’s began to feel ill on arrival in the village he Huraidhah, and since his arrival sick, so he was afraid that his end, while Habib Umar nothing in his hand, so when Al-Habib Umar arrived , then he rebuked Al-Habib Umar, but Al-Habib Umar asking why and apologize profusely for the delay, so that his father would forgive him.\n\nAnd the pain that caused the death arrives, Al-Habib Abdul Rahman fear that Al-Habib Umar did not pay attention to his brothers who are still smaller than other mothers, because he knew his step mother Al-Habib Umar did not love him as generally women. At the time of his father worried about it, then Al-Habib Umar who know for Khasaf, so he approached his father and he said: “O my father, quietly do you think about your family, Insya Allah I will love my brothers more than love myself “. Then the heart of Al-Habib Abdul Rahman became excited and he prayed for Habib Umar virtue, especially at that time, he was watching the afterlife, of the prayer of a father for his pious pious too, will be the same as the prayer of the Prophet for his people, especially Al-Habib Abdul Rahman when it is sick, Prophet once said: “If you visit those who are sick, then ask for prayer for you”.

Sheikh Abdullah then immediately left, then came Habib Umar to apologize. Al-Habib Umar said: “O Sheikh Abdullah, this village is the village of you and me in this village only newly arrived foreigners”. Sheikh Abdullah said: “Not so, O my lord, even this village is yours and I do not have any right after the hosts were here”.\n\nAl-Habib Isa Bin Muhammad Al Habsyi said: “Indeed, Al-Habib Umar has a close relationship with Sheikh Abdullah Bin Ahmad Al-Afif. And Sheikh Abdullah had said to him: “Indeed, Huraidhah is our village, but we leave it to you”. Mentioned that Sheikh Abdullah never ask for clothes (Libas) from Al-Habib Umar, then he said: “The amount of your love, it is enough”.\n\nIn both chapters in the book A’raas Taajul mentioned, that Al-Habib Ahmad Bin Hassan Al-Atthas never mentions the story of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Ahmad Al-Afif: “In the village Huraidhah, Sheikh Abdullah Al-Afif has a palm garden, when Al-Habib Umar arrived in the village, then Sheikh Abdullah vowed to give it to the palm gardens of Al-Habib Umar. When it is expressed to Al-Habib Umar, then he said to the residents Huraidhah: “O inhabitants, how do you think about the vows of Sheikh Abdullah?” Answer population Huraidhah: “In our opinion, votive Sheikh Abdullah is true”. Habib Umar replied: “Well, this land I received but I was a present back to you all as a vow of me, then accept the land from me”. There is one among them who said to him: “Why do not you give it to your family?” Said Al-Habib Umar: “Someday my grandson child will have this village all”.\n\nTeachers of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nHe studied from people who’ve studied from Sayyidina Syeikh Abu Bakr Ibn Salim, especially of his sons, namely Al-Habib Muhdhor Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr Al-Habib Hussein Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr and Al-Habib Hamid Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr .\n\nAl-Habib Umar also been studied from Habib Muhammad Bin Abdurrahman Al-Hadi, from Sayyid Umar Ibn Isa Al-Samarkandi Barakwah Al-Maghribi who is buried in the village of Al-Ghurfah.

In addition, he likes to visit the pious people of Ahlul Bait and of the family of Al-Masyaikh and pious people.\n\nAl-Habib Umar highly exalt and honor his teacher named Al-Habib Hussein Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr Ibn Salim. Thus also, when Al-Habib Umar heard the name of the teacher who is called the person, then his face changed as teacher glorify this one, even sometimes Al-Habib Umar spoke with Al-Habib Hussein Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr in the middle of a ceremony, while both unintelligible speech of others.

Then he said: “O Umar, someone who does not understand the gesture, then he will not be able to take advantage of like the light and who explain the words that are clear with words more clearly, sometimes it can add to hearing more more confused “. Furthermore, Al-Habib Umar said: “Arise fear in my heart that my teacher said words after words were deliberately aimed at me”.\n\nAl Habib Umar respect his teacher namely Al-Habib Hussein Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr Bin Salim, he even more favor Al-Habib Umar from his brothers and his friends. Al-Habib Hussein never stand to honor people, as well as for Al-Habib Umar, it is nothing but due to the high position of Habib Umar.\n\nOn a day of Al-Habib Umar with a group of leaders Alawiyin come to Al-Habib Hussein Bin Sheikh Abu Bakr Ibn Salim, at the time of Al-Habib Umar is the only one of the most humble and simplest ang wear, plus again both eyes can not see. When Al-Habib Hussein Al-Habib Umar saw was in the back of the group, the Al-Habib Hussein changed his face, then he said to the people who are leading from the group: “Surely you just prefer the outward appearance, and you do not want to glorify the most noble in proper position, when you know the glory of this man, namely Al-Habib Umar, certainly the position you are nothing, you will necks bow and spirit as well as the bodies you’ll miss him “.

The situation is the same as the link between the closely intertwined with each other, so that if the chain of existing bottom-driven, then the chain is in most ataspun will move, and vice versa. It is due to the close link between the one with the other, as well as linkages Nasab Ahlul Bait, intertwined with each other closely. Praise be to God who makes them good role models for us and we also link closely with those still “. Al-Hakim narrated from Saddad Bin Aus, he said:” When we were on the side of the Prophet, then he said:\n\n“Lift up your hands and say ” Lailaha illallaah “.

Thoriqah they prefer the shut down, humble ‘, not to indulge the passions, gentle, do not want to be known especially prominent themselves, because they feel that they themselves are not going to be a good person but only by the grace and mercy of God. These properties still followed by their descendants, especially the trustees have accrued, knowledge and love of virtue and worship deeds. Anyway Al-Habib Umar always follow in the footsteps of the pious elder, he always follows the noble manners as manners of the Prophet.\n\n“And verily thou upon the manners of the great”.\n\nIf he increased the frequency of worship are mandatory and Sunnah, then he followed what was mentioned by Imam Ghazali in Rub’ul Worship in the Ihya ‘. Similarly, if he wants to follow the sunnah and improve intentions and motivations, then he followed what was explained by Imam Ghazali in Indigenous Rub’ul in Ihya ‘. As if he wanted to stay away from the manners and behavior that is not good, then he followed what his council by Imam Ghazali in his book Rub’ul Muhlikat in Ihya‘. As if he wanted to follow the moral diredhai by God, then he will follow what is explained by Imam Ghazali in Rub’ul Munjiyat in Ihya ‘and another to seek additional information from other books.\n\nHe was always happy and smiling to all people, both for small children as well as adults, to every man feels himself as his kin. He always welcomed everyone according to their respective needs and patient though he faced many problems from them, everyone loved and be cared by him, he likes intestate to delight small children, he said: “If you can not please children small to give something, then give it to them even though a red gravel, so that they rejoice. “.\n\nHe likes grant requests and love endure the hardship of people in the hope that it can be fun family man who was helping it. Sometimes he forced himself to go to their homes, so that none of his students who told him, that he had elderly, because the elderly and it is pretty damning, but he answered: “We went to their homes, to benefit and usefulness them and we hope from God, so that every house that we enter God will forgive the occupants of the house “.\n\nIf there are two people came to the council of Al-Habib Umar, then he ask to both, who among older, once notified to him, then he let the older seated at the right hand of his younger are invited to sit on the left so that he can honor his age. According to respectively, then both pleased and be delighted with the tremendous excitement, then he spoke with both of them according to their thinking abilities of each. His morals are like that cause everyone bowled to him and his character is often called.\n\nAl-Habib Umar often visited Wadi Al-Qasar Amed and to invite residents to the path of Allah and to unite people in the dispute between them. For the purposes of this one, he sacrificed a lot of wealth and power. And very patient with those who rampart, he almost never angry, but God’s prohibition underestimated by someone, if it happens, then he is very angry, to be seen of his face.\n\nAl-Habib Umar always encourage people to diligently do deeds of worship and attend the Friday prayer and the group, he always advocated good deeds and prohibiting unjust deeds. He did not want to get into the house that the owner likes to do badness and do not want to attend their invitation, till they are willing to change their habits.\n\nAl-Habib Umar often visited Wadi Dou’an, a habit that he did from the beginning and he never forgo it except at the end. He never visited Wadi Dou’an departed from Al-Lisk with ride camels and accompanied by Al-Faqih Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Al-Asbuhi Bajamal. In a visit to Wadi Dou’an he never visited the Sheikh Ahmad Ibn Ali Ibn al-Nu’man village Hajrain Hajrain, then Sheikh Ahmad joined with him towards Qaidun to visit the tomb of Sheikh Sa’id Ibn Isa Alamudi.\n\nBecause the number of travel and trips taken by Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas to preach and to reconcile the people, then he said: “I am in the world is a stranger, it is not required of me doing the Friday prayers in a village was. He prefers ride donkey in most of his time and in his way in the middle of a very hot day. In every way, he always brings the book Ar-Risala by Imam Al-Qushayri in one hand, while on the other hand holding the book Al ‘Awarifu Al Maarif and the books like a fortress for the Sufis “.\n\nAl-Habib Umar always spend time to remembrance all branches of science, for the purposes of this one, he likes to spend time one full night. Sometimes arrived at dawn, while he was explaining the nature of various kinds of divinity (Hakaik) to his student. Anyway no one of time miss him, but he miss the worship and studying or listening to a reading. Usually if there is a group of people sitting in the evening with him, then he served them, until when they broke up, then he said to Sheikh Ali Baras: “O ‘Ali, is there anyone else besides us?”. If you answered no, then he said: “Give me the book, for we read together”.\n\nAl-Habib Umar never specializes read or teach a particular book. Al-Habib Umar Bin Al-Hussein Atthas said: “One day, I went with my father, my hand holding the reins of his vehicle, while the one hand holding a book, while he delivered to us the various branches of science through his oral, it is like a swift flowing water. When we told him: “Why do not you let us read or studied a book to you?” Then he said: “Accept that you like science is flowing from one container, even without a book”. He said to the teacher: “Teach my children to read the book of papers Syeikh Abu ‘Amr”.\n\nAl-Habib Umar very concerned for his brothers teach young abandoned by his father’s death. In advance we explained that Al-Habib Umar very concerned to teach and educate his brothers were still small, especially to understand the Quran. He encourages them to seek knowledge and love teacher told his brothers to hit them, if they do not pay attention to the lesson.\n\nEven he himself had hit his brother with his own hands, until he managed to read the Koran properly. He had sent his brother Al-Habib Aqeel to Hajrain to learn from Syeikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Umar al-Afif, until finally Al-Habib Aqil able to teach after he returned to the village Huraidhah. Every day Al-Habib Umar mosque committees attending Aqil Al-Habib after returning from religious visit to the grave of his father.\n\nWhen Al-Faqih Ibn Abdul Kabir Sheikh Abdul Kabir Baqais visit him that when he was still in the learning age, then he said: “Hi, Abdul Kabir name has lived, then revive science”. Speech he told Abdul Kabir for diligent study. With his advice, then Abdul Kabir managed to gain knowledge as much as possible until he was called Al-Faqih. Al-Habib Umar used to notify the birth of Sheikh Abdul Kabir who was still in the womb of his mother, and his father died. When the family will divide the estate of his father, at the time of Al-Habib Umar said: “Indeed, the fetus is in the mother’s womb is a boy, then save part of his estate”. It turns out that what was said by Al-Habib Umar is true.\n\nAl-Habib Umar had signaled to one of his followers, Muhammad Ibn al-Huraidzi Hishn to learn to read the Koran despite advanced age, due to have received blessings from Habib Umar, then he was given the ease by Allah. There was someone if attending to learning in council of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas, then he is much talk, so he interrupted majlis, strangely if held reading a book, then that person drowsy to sleep. Therefore, if one is present, then the Al-Habib Umar said to his companions: “Give me the book and let’s read the book, so that the person is silent because sleepy”.\n\nAl-Habib Umar ordered to issue a charity palm (Rutob) before it becomes dry dates. When it is said that some scholars say that the unauthorized issuing zakat palm before it becomes dry, then Al-Habib Umar said: They that our scholars and clerics, ask the poor, the dates are still wet or dried dates are they like “. Once answered, that they love is dates are still wet, then the opinion of Al-Habib Umar accepted by them and implemented by all the villagers.\n\nAl-Habib Ali Ibn Hussein al-Atthas mentions in his book Taajul A’raas juz 1 p 708, that Al-Habib Umar Ibn Abdurrahman Al-Atthas have disagreed with expert jurisprudence in three issues. First Al-Habib Umar argued to put the corpse in the grave head and if the body was being lowered into the grave should be lowered her legs first. Second, Al-Habib Umar argued that one does not have to intend when he makes his hand as a container for collecting water about to perform ablution (intention I’tiraf) although according to expert opinion Fiqh, that person is required to intend otherwise the water becomes musta’mal. The rationale used by Al-Habib Umar, a man who took the water when they wanted to perform ablutions, then he does not wash his hands into the water, because it does not have to intend. Third, Al-Habib Umar found someone permissible issued zakat palm when it is still wet palm fruit (rutob), although the scholars do not allow such a way, the reason Habib Umar is still wet palm fruit is preferred that the poor, rather than dried palm fruit.\n\nAlso mentioned Al-Habib Umar recommends people do pray unseen after Friday prayers finished. The time is after the priest shut his pray with greetings and after dhikr, it was announced to perform supernatural prayer for those who have died of all Muslims. This kind of tradition is still being done villagers Huraidhah and other villages who had heard fatwa Al-Habib Umar.\n\nAl-Habib Umar like to hear qashidah Al-Habib Abdullah Ibn Alwi Al-Haddad, the beginning of the stanza is: If this qasidah echoed by someone in front of Habib Umar, then he’s like telling people to repeat it, because he was thrilled and amazed qasidah it.\n\nAfter Al-Habib Umar died, then Al-Habib Abdullah Ibn Al-Haddad Alwi send someone to visit the tomb of Al-Habib Umar and told him to read qasidah mentioned above were in the tomb of Al-Habib Umar. When the man did what was ordered by Al-Habib Abdullah Ibn Al-Haddad Alwi, then he fell asleep for a moment, then suddenly there is a piece of bread that is still warm in her lap. Available when he awoke he was surprised by the presence of two slices of bread be faced, after being around him, it turns out no one was near, so he believes that the two pieces of bread it was the intercession of the Al-Habib Umar as a sign that read qasidah that have been heard by Al-Habib Umar and his pilgrimage come true. Then the piece is eaten while the piece again distributed to the children. Al-Habib Umar and his teacher, Al-Habib Hussein Ibn Syeikh Abu Bakr Ibn Salim forbid people to smoke cigarettes and forbid it.\n\nAl-Habib Umar like telling people to improve irrigation practices and fields. He is very pleased with those who like to irrigate their fields and he always prayed for their virtues, but he was not pleased with those who are lazy to put an end to their fields.\n\nAl-Habib Umar always advise people to diligently planting palm trees. In the village of Al-Qasar Reliable and produce a lot of dates. due to frequent Al-Habib Umar encourage people to plant it. Usually he advised to provide within ten steps or fifteen steps between a palm tree with the other.\n\nMany of the gifts that flow to Al-Habib Umar, but he does not want to accept it, but only a fraction thereof. Even if there is someone who gives nadzar palm trees to him, so he sometimes rejected. He did not want to accept the gift of a rule, if there is a ruler to give a gift or gifts to him or that has to do premises rulers, so he always turned them down by a sweet and smooth.\n\nAl-Habib Umar always submissive and willing to anything desired by God. Al-Habib Umar always simple in a way dressed, eat drink and place of residence. He likes to wear white clothes rugged, woven in the country, not made of India. He never wear black, apart from when the son of his death, but he also wore white and red clothes to show he was not difficult for the death of his son. When asked, why he was dressed so, then he said: “Surely the devil told us to show a sense of difficulty, but we reject that he be disappointed”.\n\nUsually if Al-Habib Umar was given a gift of fine white cloth, then use it as a pedestal he sat on his ride until it looked Damaged cloth. Usually when he was rewarded with a dress too long part of his hand, then he cut it to the extent of the palm of the hand. It is because he is imitating life traces of Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib who always cut off the hands palms up to the limit.\n\nIf Al-Habib Umar wanted to build a house, so he has asked the architect to awaken the bathroom in front of his house so that people who see it will understand, how vile the life of the world that always they received it, when he architec has finished building the walls of his house, then he was ushered into the building. After measuring the height of the building he felt had enough, so he told him to build the roof. The location of his house at the top of the village. When villagers asked for consideration Huraidhah him, where his house to be built, so he has asked them to build a house at the top of the village near the house of Sheikh Ali Ibn Salamah Basahil. Because he is very closely related to Sheikh Salamah known as the guardian of the wara‘, a worship and a very close relationship with Al-Habib Umar, so Al-Habib Umar often visited her. Al-Habib Umar said: “If I’m not afraid of fire, would I be happy in a hut”.\n\nHe was not overly concerned about food, he would eat anything that gets easily, not infrequently he starve if there is no provision that ate. Mentioned that on a night-law wife of Hussein, he does not provide dinner for Al-Habib Umar, because he thinks that Al-Habib Umar had dinner at home Salim, son. Likewise, the wife of Salim did not prepare dinner for Al-Habib Umar, because he thinks that Al-Habib Umar has been eating at home Hussein. Incidentally night aides came out with a piece of bread to eat the cow, so he took the majority, saying: “This is my supper”. Al-Habib Umar simply said: “Dates and cucumbers are better than porridge halal goat (harisah) which subhat“.\n\nOn a day when he visited Wadi ‘Amed, then he stopped at the house of one of his followers in the village. The villagers were happy to accept the presence of Al-Habib Umar, so they make porridge asidah for him. When the villagers were still busy making porridge asidah, one of the daughters of them came with a plate of food for him, he was just a little bribe. Not long after the porridge prepared asidah villagers had been completed, then they serve it to the presence of Al-Habib Umar, but he is not the least of porridge asidah feed it, so they asked him to taste it, but he rejected it with a smooth, saying: “There was a princess who brought food fruit chinese lote me, I have to eat a little and it I had enough sense “. This story is one proof of the simplicity of Al-Habib Umar in terms of food.\n\nNature posture of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nAl-Habib Ali Ibn Hassan Al-Atthas ever mention of Al-Habib Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Bafaqih, Qoidun Sahib, about the nature of self-Al-Habib Umar as follows: “Al-Habib Umar Body of medium, handsome face, his beard wide, if a look at him, then he will see the authority and the fragrant smell of him “.\n\nAl-Habib Umar fond of wearing perfume. He said: “From the size of the perfume favorite, so I want to present a vessel containing perfume, then I’ll wear it all”. Due to the magnitude of his penchant used a perfume, the fragrant smell of his sweat. On the left gastric Al-Habib Umar was a ring of black color.\n\nAl-Habib Umar as a Sheikh and Murabbi\n\nAl-Habib Umar is a Sheikh, a murabbi and a preacher to God in his actions and said he said. Al-Habib Umar once said: “When I was asked to be a preacher, then I reject it for various reasons”. Then said to me: “We will make you a companion and help that will be there with to fulfill your duty”, pointing to Sheikh Ali Baras. So I accepted it and Sheikh Ali Baras will help me and support me “.\n\nHabib Umar said: “Verily the resources to get the light God has not diminished at all for generations to come at the end of time, but they come with a perforated vessels”.\n\nIn the beginning, Sheikh Ali Baras busy helping Al-Habib Umar in conveying his message. On a day when Sheikh Ali Baras sitting on the side of Al-Habib Umar, so he asked him: “What book do you have?” Said Sheikh Ali Baras: “The book is in my hands is Bidayatul Hidayah”. Al-Habib Umar said: “Read the book”. Then Sheikh Ali Baras read his sermon. Furthermore, Al-Habib Umar said to Sheikh Ali Baras: “Stop right there, I have given you” diploma “in the field of Shari’a, Tareqat and Essence, it is a diploma awarded received all coincide at the time of prayer”.\n\nHabib Isa Ibn Muhammad Al-Habsyi said: “Usually if someone comes with good intentions to Al-Habib Umar, then he will receive all complaints and menghormatnya to reveal sacred, noble qualities like these that good intentions and beliefs strong rarely owned by other guests and sanctity he seldom seen except a really obediently, good intentions and strong sound belief “.\n\nSheikh Ali Baras once told Al-Habib Umar: “Although you often visit the Wadi ‘Amed and other villages, but strangely not many are guided by the fact of you, and I’m sure that if an indigent meet with you for sure he would become Muslims “. Al-Habib Umar replied: “If I meet a heart like you, of course I can deliver it to God in the shortest period of time, but I find people who only talk about:” Habib will go, Habib will come “. In other words do not have the preparation and confidence in him “.\n\nMentioned that one day there was a student came to him with the intention to appeal the decision from him. Before the disciples tell him what is in his heart, so in a way he kasyaf answer what will be asked by the disciples: “O people, most human beings should abandon what he had to do, no one can come to me unless you want to inquire about mundane problems such as rainmaking, want a child or ask for opinions, but every student who comes to me with good intentions to get the problems that noble, surely he will get virtues that he wanted “.\n\nThere was a pious of the inhabitants of a village Hadzyah named Ahmad Ibn Abdillah Bajusair, he was a teacher of the Koran for small children. Usually if villagers Syibam pilgrimage to the place of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas, then they stopped in the village Hadzyah and will pass through the house’s teacher of the Koran, as well as when they come home from his place. At one time, the teacher said to one of the nearby: “I see Syibam resident who went to the Al-Habib Umar in a state of a particular face, and they go home with a different face of the face before. Why is that? “When the speech teacher of the Koran was delivered to Al-Habib Umar, then he said:” Say to him, sometimes human duties as teacher of the Koran like you, sometimes an educator, whether he did not understand that I like crocodiles, their eggs on land and he remained at sea and maintaining enough eggs with a view “.\n\nAl-Habib Ahmad Ibn Hashim Al-Habsyi said: “Formerly I and As-Sayyid Abdullah Al-Haddad frequent visits to Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas, not long, then Al-Habib Abdullah received divine radiance (Futuh) before I got it , so my interest to him is reduced. When I stir my situation to Habib Umar, then he faces me and pray me to get like that found Al-Habib Abdullah Al-Haddad. So since then I will get a divine radiance.\n\nAl-Habib Abdurrahman Ibn Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas said: “When I came out of the village Ahrum, then I met a wandering Darweesh being. At that time he was about to cross the street. When I saluted him, then he said, welcome O so and so. He called my name and he showed his delight with me even though I’ve never met him at an earlier time. I asked him, how do you know my name, even though you have never been acquainted with me? “The man replied:” How did I not know you, in case you are the son of our teacher, Al-Habib Umar Bin Abdurrahman Al-Atthas. Surely your father often came to our country are unseen and his name is better known in our area than anywhere you “.\n\nHabib Ahmad Ibn Hussein Ibn ‘Umar said: “I’ve been told by someone who I do not doubt the honesty that he had met with a Darweesh of Sind country in Africa who said:” Al-Habib Umar Bin Abdurrahman Al-Atthas frequent visits to the country our in Sind to teach us Sufism and science Tareqat and he is widely known in our country “.\n\nSheikh Abdullah Ibn Abdurrahman Ba’ubad said that when he was with Sheikh Ali Baras and thirteen companions came to the Al-Habib Umar, then the first one I saw was his face light very bright, so I do not remember going to my presence, because I see myself him like a brilliant pearl white, and his face emits a bright light, then the resulting desire not to be parted from him all my life. We had settled in his place for a few days. When he gave us permission to go home to our village, so he said to me: “O my son, the place and the fountain and the trip is only one kind, whoever wants separates me from Sheikh Ali Baras, then he will not make a profit “.\n\nAl-Habib Abdullah Ibn Al-Haddad Alwi said: “When I visited the Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas, then I saw in him, the existence of the properties contained in the elders of his up on themselves Prophet”.\n\nHabib Isa Ibn Muhammad Al-Habsyi and the other billah wise, many said that the personal circumstances of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas and follow-up is much different from the other guardian figures. Although the circumstances and his position is very high, but he was more than happy to humble, gentle, warm-hearted to everyone and a very high morals in which very few people have a certain character like him.\n\nWhen mentioning the nature of Al-Habib Umar, Ibn Ahmad Habib Zein Al-Habsyi said: “Many of his comrades who received the virtue of Al-Habib Umar, many people who become his disciples and many were receiving talkin dhikr and receive khirqoh from him “.\n\nThe books are been booked by Habib Umar Al-Atthas to learn\n\n· Az Zubad papers Syeikh Ibn Ruslan.\n\nHabib Umar always send our children to memorize the book nadzom Zubad.\n\n· Bidaayatul Hidaayah Imam Ghozali papers.\n\nSheikh Ali Baras never read the book Bidaayatul Hidaayah preamble before Habib Umar, then he gave a diploma to Sheikh Ali Baras so that God may open branches ma’rifat him.\n\n· Al Minhaaj writings of Imam Nawawi.\n\nSheikh Abdullah Ibn Umar Ba’ubaid said: “When I visited the place Habib Umar, he said to me:” I’ve read the book Al-Irshad, writing Sheikh Ismail Al-Muqri “. Then he said to Sheikh Ali Baras: “O Ali, read him the book of Al-Minhaaj, papers Imam Nawawi and also read the book to your companions, because the book is a blessing and give futuh, Insha-Allah, because the constituent a Trustee Qutub and he prayed for each reader, may be blessed “.\n\n· Ar Risalah papers and Awarifu Qushayri Imam Al-Maarif writings of Imam Al-Saharwurdi. Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas always read both books wherever he goes. Said he: “Ar treatise and Al-Awarif and books seemed very important to read, because both include suppliers spiritual nourishment for experts Tasawwuf”.\n\nFeel self-sufficient of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nHe is known to be very wara‘. He did not want to ever receive any gift from the ruler, do not ever want to be invited to eat and drink, to any just having coffee with the ruling, he even refused charcoal fuel that comes from the ruler. Acts against the rejection of the Sultanate of Badr Ibn Abdillah Al-Katsiri when it comes to visit him, someday I will mention in a separate chapter. He did not want to eat from giving people a way bussines usury ‘. There is a visit him in Wadi Amed, then he is welcome to stop at the home of a family Basulaib, while they do not want to give the inheritance for daughters, then stroked refused to stop and he said: “How am I going to stop at the home of the do not want to give the inheritance to his daughters? Yet God told gave the Quran, Allah says: “God ordained for you about the division of inheritance for your children, which is part of a boy together with part two daughters”.\n\nThe man said: “Starting from today, I will give inheritance for daughters”. Then Habib Umar would stop at that house and he prayed for the man’s family, so they were given a blessing and happiness “.\n\nAt a time when he visited the home of a family in the village Basuwaid Anaq. Then he met with an over whelming response, and he was given a pumpkin. He asked: “Where did you get this pumpkin?” The man replied: “I plucked from a garden belonging to endowments”. He said he: “Well, we are not allowed to eat from the garden which has a present (waqf), because the garden has a present it belongs to all Muslims”. The man said: “From now on I am no longer willing to eat from the garden which has diwakafkan, and how the results that I have eaten in earlier times?” Habib Umar said: “To redeem the past, then take care of the garden , then share the results for the Muslims “. So since then, the garden has diwakafkan it started as possible “.\n\nHabib Umar did not want to accept the will of a property unless he has explain really about willing heirs. At one time there was a woman who willed most of her jewelry worth three Uqiyah. When she died the property owner, the property which will was given to him, but he would not accept it until after clarifying the pleasure of the heirs of the will treasure “.\n\nMentioned by Sheikh Ali Ibn Salim Al-Junaid, that his father named Salim never borrowed a donkey for vehicles to drive Habib Umar who would go to the village Lahrum. Surprisingly, when she reached the middle of the journey, the donkey stopped and sat in the desert, when the air is very hot at that time. Sheikh Salim said: “I’m almost at this ass, but he stopped me and said that the owner is not willing he ass beaten”. Then he said: “Hold her head and I’ll help you, so he goes”. Similarly, when the donkey was strike back, then Salim was about to hit him, but he turned it down, and he helped her to get her to walk “.\n\nAnd if it had been entered at prayer time, while the imam was near him, then he drove and said: “Go thou to become a priest, you are not permitted to sit here, if your duties as a priest the time has come”.\n\nSense of humble Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nAl-Habib Abdullah Ibn Alawi Al-Haddad said: “That man (Al-Habib Umar) that his tree planted on the basis of humble and gentle, so stems like it too”. It shows both the nature of his character.\n\nAl-Habib Abdullah Ibn Alawi Al-Haddad said: “When we visited the village of Habib Umar Huraidhah into place, we saw Habib Umar to be very humble ‘, none of the big guys who can keep his temper like that. Once tawadhu his temperament, despite his high position, till he can not be distinguished by comrades other seat. In the middle his council, he does not sit in a special place, do not wear special clothes, so he is no different with his friends sitting others. When you wake up because there is hunger and seat occupied others, belaiu not angry and did not tell him to move, he even sit somewhere else, until I once said: “It would not politely you against this priest”.\n\nAt one time, residents Syibam scrambling to shake hands with him, a man who when he saw the simplicity of Habib Umar and sense of humble clothes, then he said: “A man like this, we are in the Tarim not invited to shake hands with him”. When the speech was heard by Habib Umar, then he said: “It is inappropriate words, because that is in the Tarim only people face-face like the moon”. He repeated many times.\n\nOn a day when people come to a place Habib Umar to congratulate him on the birth of his child, while the population of the city was no one comes, they are the ones who rampart and leave at prayer and Friday, then there one of the villagers who heard that Habib Umar had a son, and he said ass have children, a speech mocking and very inappropriate. Hearing ridicule him, Habib Umar was not angry, even Habib Umar went to that house with his seven friends. His arrival makes it very joyful person, so that he became very amazed to his gentle manners. Habib Umar’s visit on Friday morning. When Habib Umar was about to come out, so he asked the man and his friends who did not want to attend Friday prayers: “Why did you not attend Friday prayers, but have nice clothes and fragrant smell?” They replied: “are we allowed to attend Friday prayers to wear nice clothes and fragrant?” Habib Umar replied: “No”. Then they go out together to attend Friday prayers with feeling happy and satisfied because of the character and behavior of Habib Umar.\n\nA Benefactor of Al-Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nHabib Umar Al-Atthas known as a very cheap hand, so the house is always flooded with all walks of life who need his help. A benefactor of Habib Umar never distinguished people, everyone likened his ministry, he’s either indigent or high-ranking officials. Habib Umar particularly concerned to feed people, so ordered aides to keep some of the crops for later when coming famine. So if there are people who need help, surely their needs can be met. Although the magnitude of a benefactor Habib Umar, but he never brag in front of the weak. His always provide services to vulnerable people with compassion, so they never shame to him. Similarly, Habib Umar never force myself to entertain his guests, his sometimes poor, serve him meat when he had it. Sometimes his ruler, serve him sober, even he prefers the weak from the ruler. This is evident in his treatment of the Sultan Ibn Muhammad Al-Badr Katsiri. That he did so deliberately did not feel in the heart of the Sultan that he needed the help of the Sultan or want to get closer to him.\n\nSometimes if there are people distinguished visiting him, while he does not have a proper meal was served for them. But he did not hesitate to request assistance or loans to slaughter a goat for dinner guests who regarded it, so they are not disappointed when the tribute or the cuisine is considered insufficient.\n\nAl-Habib Umar as told by his son, Al-Habib Abdullah always leave or keep a portion of the annual harvest for the famine, although most people do not pay attention to this. Therefore, if a lot of people who beg food aid at his home when the famine comes, then it is not surprising because he has long been preparing to face a food crisis like that. In the current food crisis has engulfed his people, then he is helping people who need food. Among them, there are each time fed directly at his home, but there are also sent food to their homes, especially for families who can not ask someone for help, but the famine that forced them to look for help and also to strengthen the friendship.\n\nSometimes, there are a number of guests who came to his home at the end of the night, and he welcomed them with hospitality. Usually when there are guests at the end of the night, he woke his wife to prepare dinner for guests who arrive late in the evening, sometimes he kept most dinner, perhaps preparatory guests come. Usually if the staple food running low, so he and his family would not eat staple. He and his family choosing food substitute, being the staple food given to other people who need it, especially for the guests who come to his house. If the staple food is completely discharged, then he gave food in any form without shame.\n\nHabib Umar was not happy effacing him\n\nHabib Umar was known as a man who always conceal their features and perseverance of worship. Similarly, Habib Umar always bequeath it to his students.\n\nHabib Umar like seclusion from society.

With the power of God, prayer beads that change seemed to be a big snake that crawled in between them so as to seek refuge in his presence. Then they ask for forgiveness from Habib Umar and receive calls for peace.\n\nMentioned that there is a debtor and the creditor complained both to Habib Umar problem.

When the brothers were reported to Habib Umar, then they are advised to give the right neighbor, but both refused even against Habib Umar with full brash so Habib Umar said to them: “You shall we enter into a sea of never-edged”. As a result of Habib Umar’s words, one of the brothers had changed his mind so that he attacked his brother, and his brother joined the unconscious so that the two are mutually Draw a sharp weapon, finally stabbing each other until they both died in disgrace.\n\nHabib Umar always think positive\n\nKnown by many people that Habib Umar always positive minded and opinion may be a good clue. He saw the eyes of the heart. Because it’s a lot of people who always ask his opinion. For those who follow his opinion and wisdom, then he will be happy. In contrast to those who violate the opinion that he was not a bit of regret and loss. Among his opinion that the benefit is the opinion he gave to Syeikh Muhammad Ibn Hussein al-Huraidhi to memorize the Koran. While he was older and he was given a receipt then ease by God.\n\nAmong the opinion he is the Sheikh Muhammad Al-Amiri late-Nahdi to plant palm trees in one place called Dhahirah, but the opinion of Habib Umar was considered weak by most people.

Sheikh Abdullah understand the meaning of the instructions he was, so he dug a well, and he built a mosque on the site. After that, he reported what he did to Habib Umar. With the blessing of Habib Umar, the wealth of Sheikh Abdullah returned to normal.\n\nWhen residents Syibam asked Habib Abdullah Al-Haddad, where a good prayer in the mosque or in the mosque Bamika Abdullah belongs to someone else, then Habib Abdullah Al-Haddad encourages people to pray in the mosque of Abdullah Bamika because the mosque was built on the instructions of a guardian of God, namely Habib Umar Al-Atthas.\n\nIt also said that when most of the population of the tribe came to Habib Umar Nahdi about the length of the season heat in their village, until their date palm orchards many dry. Habib Umar encourage them to remain patient in their village, they were forbidden to move to another place, hopefully soon Allah will send rain to their village. Finally, by following the instructions Habib Umar to remain patient, it is not long before Allah sends down water for the villagers, so that irrigation for gardens of dates they run smoothly again as before.\n\nMentioned that Sheikh Omar Bin Ahmad Al-Hilabi Al-Juaydi always closely linked and fully confident to Ahbib Umar, and never violate his opinion. Therefore Habib Umar pleading to God for the good of Sheikh Omar Al-Hilabi and for his grand children. At a time when this Umar Sheikh Habib Umar stopped in place, then he was welcomed by him. It was just before the harvest season. When he asked permission to leave the place Habib Umar, then he said: “O Umar, if you arrive at your village, then panenlah and take the results kurmamu tree”.\n\nInstructions Habib Umar was carried out as well as possible by Sheikh Omar without a doubt, because of the strong accord against Habib Umar, whereas if the harvest now, then the result will be reduced to village residents loudly rebuke, even among those there who think Syeikh Umar was crazy, luckily he still appreciates the instructions Habib Umar.\n\nA short time later when troops stormed grasshopper palm trees villagers, all results will be harvested by the villagers so that they regret Damaged their fate because they do not get the crop at harvest dates it, while Sheikh Umar had harvest before the army of locusts stormed the plant.

After he was somewhat forced, then Habib Umar said: “We hold you to your home in order to avoid charges that will happen alleged theft your village population to your brothers and your family”. So what was said by Habib Umar was indeed the case, so the Sheikh Ma’ruf avoid charges of theft. But not too long alleged theft was drawn by villagers Hajraian, because thieves can actually be immediately arrested.\n\nOn a day when he gathered with community leaders of his people, so he advised them to immediately improve water channels used to irrigate their dates. Habib Umar’s advice was carried out by his people even though the month is the holy month of Ramadan.

Not long from it, then he is sick and died, so the amount of food that he hide it so the traveler’s dishes the old man’s body.\n\nHabib Umar’s attitude towards the ruling\n\nHabib Umar was known as a man who is not afraid of the authorities. He likes to advise them despite the advice he sometimes felt bitter by the authorities. And he always refused granting or their dishes, thus was firewood of them he did not want to use it. One day, when the messenger Sultan Badr Al-Badr Katsiri informed that the Sultan would visit him in Huraidhah, then he told me that he would come to the Sultan of where he was, therefore he will ask the Sultan to remain where he now resides. Habib Umar then immediately left and he sent his servant to bring coffee, wood and fire, which was for him to drink coffee in the Sultan, because he does not want to drink any of the Sultan or the property of the ruler. After he was confronted with the Sultan of Badr, then he gave him useful advice about the world and the afterlife. At that time, the Sultan sent his servant Badr coffee mixed with honey and asked to be served to Habib Umar and his entourage. Once cooked for a long time, then the Sultan ordered his aides to his serve immediately before Habib Umar. When the maid to look into where the water is being cooked, he was surprised because in place of water, the water and the honey was not there so he immediately reported to the Sultan of Badr. Reports of the maid was made Sultan Habib Umar Badr realize that very steeper sense of wara’ and he felt that the water was exhausted due to the large coffee his intercession. Finally Sultan Badr immediately apologize to Habib Umar. Badr Sultan said: “Why do we invite you to drink a cup of coffee from our course, you do not want?” Habib Umar replied: “Indeed, if we do not take care of myself, of course, we will not be able to do that”. Usually if the authorities ask for opinions from Habib Umar, then he gave an honest opinion, although the suggestion he was deemed not please him.\n\nMentioned when there is a ruler in Hadramaut said to Habib Umar: “We always remember you and expect prayer, O Habib Umar”. Habib Umar replied: “We do not fear you will be subjected to interference from the west and east citizens, unless there is a man who abused their rights to pray, for the prayers of the oppressed will be granted by God. At that moment my prayers may not be useful for you “. Habib Umar Al-Atthas known as someone who does not want to accept any gift from the ruler shape. Even so every gift given to Habib Umar then he took them with him to give it again next karamah to who gave him a respectful manner so that gives not feel offended or wherewithal to the poor. Habib Umar was very attentive to his followers who love him. Linkage feeling Habib Umar on his followers who love very big. This problem is known about many people. Among these are as narrated by Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Bamasymus following: “When I was little, I had to travel in a vast desert and arid with a group entourage. When we arrived at a place that is no water, so we feel very thirsty, so our group fled and I was left alone in the middle of a barren desert can not overtake them. Then not long I get a spring so I drink water with your heart’s content. I think that spring is plain old spring water taken, then I continued my journey and I get people to leave I’d been fighting over water in a fountain. Then they lie down because of tired and thirsty. When they saw me coming, they menyilahkan I drank in the spring, but I said that I had been drinking at a spring that had you been through it. They were surprised that my words, because they feel that it does not have springs apart from where they were at that time. Once I was an adult, when I met with Habib Umar, then he asked me: “O Muhammad, you remember when you were in a desolate place and you almost died of thirst, then you soon find springs and you take it up? “Habib Umar’s speech reminded me that it was an intercession of him”. Sheikh Muhammad Bamasymus also mentioned that one day when we and Sheikh Ali Baras and his entourage visited the village of Habib Umar in Huraidhah, so he has asked us to continue the journey to the bottom of the Hadramaut. When we arrived in the city of Tarim, I’m sick to not be able to follow the group Sheikh Ali Baras. Then he asked, then when I got to the village Dhibiy, my pain grew louder until I pengsan. At night when I was in a state of sickly, I heard Habib Umar being cleared his throat at his home in Huraidhah while I am now in Wadi Dhibi. So at the moment there goes my followers and my health been recovered. It was none other than due to his sanctity.\n\nNarrated by Sheikh Salim Ibn Abdul Qawi that his father’s name was Abdul Qawi Bin Muhammad Baqais, that one day Sheikh Abdul Qawi run on a mountain with a friend. When both of them will rise to the top, then they find a way to be passed in order to get to the top. Brief said, both have a narrow road towards the top. The road was only able to pass a course. When his first ride, suddenly a large stone fell down. Incidentally at that time Sheikh Abdul Qawi going up to the top so that the large stone that passes through the narrow streets that Sheikh Abdul Qawi felt threatened and he was shocked. Fortunately, at that moment he remembered to Habib Umar that he called out the name of Habib Umar Al-Atthas. With the permission of Allah, the stone was already behind him until he was spared. Surely it is the incident as evidence of God’s help and their sanctity Habib Umar Al-Atthas.\n\nSalmin noted that Sheikh Ibn Umar and his friends went to Yemen. They ride horses. Sheikh Salmin known as the advanced rider. When the group passed through a beach, suddenly the horse ridden by Sheikh Salmin walk along the waterfront. Incidentally at that time there were waves crashing Sheikh Salmin horse, to horse Sheikh Salmin dragged out to sea until his friends deeply regrets his circumstances were dragged into the middle of the ocean. They can not give the slightest relief on Sheikh Salmin. Incidentally Sheikh Salmin who are facing death was recalled to Habib Umar that he shouted the name of Habib Umar and he vowed if he was saved from the danger of death was God, then he will give you the price of the horse to Habib Umar. By the grace of God, then he seems to be saved by someone who was riding a horse. After he survived, he mounted his horse which had been dragged into the middle of the ocean. Not too long he can pursue his friends until they stunned and delighted. Then he tells what he found and he fulfill his vow to Habib Umar. It also said that Muhammad Ibn Al-Huraidhi Hushin ever taught by Habib Umar Al-Atthas to memorize the Quran despite his advanced age, with conviction, then he made the suggestion Habib Umar and finally he can memorize the Koran by rote. One day, Muhammad Ibn Al-Huraidhi Hushin these late nights with friends. Incidentally at that time being merosak locust season crops.

Arriving in the cave of the torch of them pose a fire burning in the surrounding areas. It appears that the fire was underestimated by them, so they ignore it. After the fire continues to expand, they have no way out of the cave so that they are sure that they will perish. So at that time they remembered to Habib Umar, then they beg forgiveness of Allah with connect (tawassul) to Habib Umar. So with the love of God countered one of the loopholes of the cave was open so stretched way out for them from the cave. That is one of the umpteenth story of sanctity Habib Umar. Habib Ali Ibn Hasan al-Atthas: “The story of Muhammad Ibn Hushin experienced and friends in the cave was very similar to the story of the Israelites three men who were trapped in the cave as mentioned in the hadith of Bukhari”. This situation even more frightening. Habib Umar compassion towards animals.\n\nHabib Umar very fond of animals. This is evident from the following events. He mentioned when into his house, so he asked a number of food taken for the sake of his family owned for his new donkey ride.\n\nIt also said that Habib Umar forbade Sheikh Salim Al-Junaid to hit the donkey that strike in a very hot place. He told Sheikh Salim to lift the donkey’s neck and Habib Umar help him. Although donkey broke down many times, but still prohibits Syeikh Habib Umar Salim to hit him.\n\nAt one time, there was a of Lahrum who bring their livestock herds hard to beat. So he came to Habib Umar. When he was about to shake hands with Habib Umar, then Habib Umar refused to shake hands with him. Habib Umar replied: “I do not want to shake hands with you as hand pain”. Then the men were asked: “For what?” He replied: “From the pain of the blow when you beat your cattle earlier”. When the man apologized to Habib Umar then he strongly advised him that he does not repeat the offense. Disturbances affecting Habib Umar Al-Atthas. A person who has the task as well as enforcement Preachers truth, then the interference-interference not least, even he heard a man say to him: “What a delicious you, O Habib Umar, because you will not be a sort of no man who dared to hate you”. Then he said: “Tell me Lailaaha illa sentence as those who hate Habib Umar”. It shows the many people who are hostile to him. People who annoy and hurt Habib Umar was not the sake only of people outside, but from the people in his own house, that of his own wife. The story is as follows: On a night you come home to a group of Habib Umar. Then he woke his wife and told her to make the evening meal for his guests, but his wife rejected. Habib Umar asked him gently but his wife decided otherwise. Habib Umar finally forced out of his neighbor’s house for help so that his wife cooking dinner for his guests. Then the neighbor’s wife was pleased to make dinner for guests Habib Umar. Habib Umar painful not only occur during Habib Umar was still alive, but after he wafatpun, not a few who instigate and berate him.

The traveler’s corpse he conducted the reading of the Koran and finished many times and it lasted eight days in his grave side. It shows how big his intercession. Right at the burial Habib Umar, the atmosphere in the village was overwhelmed cloudy and rainy. The departure of Habib Umar banya poets evoke the desire to pour their grief in verses beautiful poem. Among the poems of Al-Faqih Umar Ibn Qadim.\n\nSome dream about the state of Habib Umar after he passed away in the night Right death of Habib Umar Al-Atthas, one of the pious family in Tarim Ba’alawi dream as if the moon and the sun fell on the ground Ba’alawi family, in fact he heard about the death news Habib Umar. Mentioned by Sheikh Abdullah Bin Sheikh Ali Bin Abdullah Baras, he said when Sheikh Ali had died, then Syeikh Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Bamasymus dreams met with Sheikh Ali Baras and he asked him: “Where are you meeting with Habib Umar?” Answer Sheikh Ali Baras: “I was shaking hands with Habib Umar near the Throne of God”. Mentioned by a family Bawazir, that he had a dream in one night as if doomsday had arrived. At that moment as if humans were gathered in the field Mahsyar, their number very much. When they were in the middle of the field Mahsyar, suddenly there was a fire under Hadraumaut, while the Angels lead people with very long iron. When people see a fire and a long chain, then they ran into a spot in Wadi Amed, then I see no light descending from heaven like a white cloud coagulating. When I ask: “What’s happening?” Then said: “This is the light of the Supreme Majesty who want to judge men on the field Mahsyar. At that moment I saw Habib Umar stood under the light beam, while Angel Ridwan was on his right side. Similarly, Angel Malik comes with a grim face. Then I saw Habib Umar invoke the intercession to God for the people of Muhammad: “O our Lord, they are the people of Muhammad, they come to you with a witness that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad the Messenger of Allah testifies that they establish prayer, pay zakat, Ramadan fasting, Hajj worship, charity, connecting ties with family, enforce Amar Ma’ruf and Nahi Munkar, away from immoral acts, for fear of thee. If you torment them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, You Exalted, the Most Wise.\n\nSpeech Habib Umar was denied by Angel Malik: “O our Lord, they are not as stated by Habib Umar. They left the prayer, do not want to pay the zakat, fasting and pilgrimage not, and they always violate prohibitions You. Habib Umar once again repeated his request and Angel Malik was repeated denial anyway, until finally God says: “For the sake of my glory, I have received a request Habib Umar and I am pleased to forgive them”. Allah says: “O Angel Ridwan, open the door of heaven and invite them into it”. Then Angel Ridwan rise and merry and execute the command of God to him. Meanwhile, Malik Angel looks very grim. said the man who dreamed it: “At that moment, as if I was standing with them by holding clothes Habib Umar and I am very afraid that I said to Habib Umar:” O Habib Umar, talk to Angel Ridwan so I entered heaven with him “. Habib Umar said: “Go thou with them into heaven because of my prayers have been accepted by God for this uma”. I said: “Talk to Angels Ridwan to bring into heaven, because I’m afraid of my sins are very much”. Habib Umar said: “O Angel Ridwan, bring these people into heaven”. Ridwan angel replied: “Let it go together”. When Angel Ridwan took my hand and led me into heaven, then I woke up because it feels very happy “.\n\nAphorisms of Habib Umar Al-Atthas\n\nHabib Umar once said: “Pay attention to the good habits that you want, died in the habit of it, because it’s still in the habit you like it, and pay attention to the bad habits that you do not want his death in such habits, because it distracts the habit”.\n\nHabib Umar said: “If you see an always well-behaved, then rest assured that the firm your religion”\n\nHabib Umar said: “The sources of knowledge will not be reduced at all of the later generations, but in general they come up with a leaking container, so it does not acquire knowledge except a little.”\n\nHabib Umar said: “Most people who come to bring vessel which can be inadequate in a month’s time, there were inadequate only 8 days, there is also the insufficiency of the day, but there also can be inadequate throughout his life”.\n\nWhen he heard the words of the Prophet: “One sometimes charitable virtues up between him and heaven only stay an inch, but in the divine provision, he was designated as the inhabitants of Hell, so he did the deeds of charity dwellers of Hell, until he went to in Hell. Someone sometimes charitable crimes up between him and Hell just stay an inch, but in the divine decree, he was assigned as prospective residents heaven, until he entered into heaven “. Comments Habib Umar: “Someone who always do deeds expert heaven, mostly will enter into heaven, for he has done is the epitome lahiriyah batiniyah deeds. If he was to go to hell, it rarely. It was like a man falling from a place that is not too high, of course, that person will not be dangerous. Similarly, one who does deeds population hell, most of it will go to hell. But when he entered into heaven, it rarely happens once. It was like a man who fell from the top of the mountain, mostly going to die “.\n\nHabib Umar said: “The one who does good deeds, but he likes to eat the forbidden, then he is like a man who took a jar of water with a flat, alias will get no reward at all”.\n\nHabib Umar said: “It used to be among men, no one came to bring complete with oil lamps and the matches that the preparations are complete, so that the teacher can ignite. But now, many of which came to the teachers but they do not carry any teacher can turn on “.\n\nHabib Umar said: “Patience is the result was positive. God will always give a positive result for a patient who. Thank God what is God’s will for sure be determined, and what will be done God, then it will be done “.\n\nHabib Umar said to a group of peasants: “Does the farmer will sleep soundly at night, when in the evening there is a division of water for their rice fields that can irrigate their fields?” They replied, “No one will sleep among us. “Habib Umar said:” Let those who want to leave his salvation in the Hereafter, in order to get a splash of grace in the middle of the night “.\n\nWhen recited verses Sheikh Abdul Hadi Assudi: “Who love Suad, should always do not sleep at night”. Habib Umar gave his comment: “Who loves Huraidhah, then he does not sleep at night, meaning that anyone who loves a, then he should follow his journey, because following the person’s behavior as a sign of love to him”.\n\n11. Habib Umar said: “May you always bring your heart to God and you should always bring your heart to God and you should put their trust in Him wholeheartedly, because God knows wherever you are.”\n\nHabib Umar said: “Satan can tempt people from any side he never anticipated”.\n\nHabib Umar said: “Dates or cucumber from a lawful source better than pureed meat from doubtful sources”.\n\nHabib Umar said: “Do not care about the world and its inhabitants and do not be jealous anyway with clothing or food that is owned by its inhabitants”.\n\nOne day, when many people were saying to Habib Umar condolences on the death of his young son, then he said with an expression that was filled with wonder: “What a disaster lightly in religion according to you, but you never condolences suppose I’m late pray together means too late to pray in congregation is more worthy to be sad over someone death little boy “.
