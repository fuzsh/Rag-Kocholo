        "text": "Field Marshal Ali Abdullah Saleh (Arabic: علي عبدالله صالح‎; born 21 March 1942[2][3][4]) is the first President of the Republic of Yemen. Saleh previously served as President of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) from 1978 until 1990, at which time he assumed the office of chairman of the Presidential Council of a post-unification Yemen. He is the longest-serving president of Yemen, ruling since 1978,[5] and the longest-serving non-royal national leader in the world as of November 2011.[6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Rise to power\n\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Ties with Iran\n\n3 Current status\n\n3.1 2011 Yemeni protests\n\n3.2 Assassination attempt, aftermath and return\n\n4 See also\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nRise to power\n\nSaleh was born in the town of Cameno,[2] in the Al-Ahmar family — the ruling family of the Hashid tribal confederacy. Saleh is a Zaydi Shia Muslim.[2] He is a \"non-Hashimi\" Zaydi (not a direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandfather), and would not have been eligible to rule under the Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen that ruled the country until 1962.[7]\n\nSaleh obtained less than an elementary school education.[2] He joined the North Yemeni armed forces in 1958 and the North Yemen Military Academy in 1960,[1] and became a corporal.[2] Three years later, he was commissioned from the ranks as a second lieutenant.[1] In 1977, the President of North Yemen, Ahmed bin Hussein al-Ghashmi, appointed him as military governor of Ta'izz.[2]\n\nAfter al-Ghashmi was assassinated on 24 June 1978, Saleh was appointed to be a member of the four-man provisional presidency council and deputy to the general staff commander.[1][2] On 17 July 1978, Saleh was elected by the Parliament[citation needed] to be the President of the Yemen Arab Republic, chief of staff and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[1]\n\nCareer\n\nOn 10 August 1978, Saleh ordered the execution of 30 officers charged to be part of a conspiracy against his rule.[2]\n\nSaleh was promoted to colonel in 1979, elected the secretary-general of the General People's Congress party on 30 August 1982, and re-elected president of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1983.[1]\n\nThe decline of the Soviet Union severely weakened the status of South Yemen, and, in 1990 the North and South agreed to unify after years of negotiations. The South accepted Saleh as President of the unified country, while Ali Salim al-Beidh served as the Vice President and a member of the Presidential Council.[8][page needed]\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh was a long-time ally of Iraq's Saddam Hussein and supported Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. After Iraq lost the Gulf War, Yemeni workers were deported from Kuwait by the restored government.[9]\n\nIn the 1993 parliamentary election, the first held after unification, Saleh's General People's Congress won 122 of 301 seats.[10]:309\n\nOn 24 December 1997, Parliament approved Saleh's promotion to the rank of field marshal.[1][2] He is currently the highest-ranking military officer in Yemen.[2]\n\nSaleh became Yemen's first directly-elected president in the 1999 presidential election, winning 96.2% of the vote.[10]:310 The only other candidate, Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha'abi, was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi, a former President of South Yemen. Though a member of Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.[11]\n\nAfter the 1999 elections the Parliament passed a law extending presidential terms from five to seven years, extending parliamentary terms from four to six years, and creating a 111-member, presidentially-appointed council of advisors with legislative power.[1] This move prompted Freedom House to downgrade their rating of political freedom in Yemen from 5 to 6.[12]\n\nIn July 2005, during the 27th anniversary celebrations of his presidency, Saleh announced that he would \"not contest the [presidential] elections\" in September 2006. He expressed hope that \"all political parties – including the opposition and the General People's Congress – find young leaders to compete in the elections because we have to train ourselves in the practice of peaceful succession.\"[13] However, in June 2006, Saleh changed his mind and accepted his party's nomination as the presidential candidate of the GPC, saying that when he initially decided not to contest the elections his aim was \"to establish ground for a peaceful transfer of power\", but that he was now bowing to the \"popular pressure and appeals of the Yemeni people.\" Political analyst Ali Saif Hasan said he had been \"sure [President Saleh] would run as a presidential candidate. His announcement in July 2005 – that he would not run – was exceptional and unusual.\" Mohammed al-Rubai, head of the opposition supreme council, said the president's decision \"show[ed] that the president wasn’t serious in his earlier decision. I wish he hadn’t initially announced that he would step down. There was no need for such farce.\"[11]\n\nIn the 2006 presidential election, held on 20 September Saleh won with 77.2% of the vote. His main rival, Faisal bin Shamlan, received 21.8%.[1][14] Saleh was sworn in for another term on September 27.[15]\n\nIn December 2005, Saleh stated in a nationally-televised broadcast that only his personal intervention had preempted a U.S. occupation of the southern port of Aden after the 2000 USS Cole bombing, stating \"By chance, I happened to be down there. If I hadn’t been, Aden would have been occupied as there were eight U.S. warships at the entrance to the port.\"[16] However, transcripts from the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee state that no other warships were in the vicinity at the time.[page needed]\n\nTies with Iran\n\nIn April 2000, Saleh visited Tehran to cement Iranian-Yemeni military relations, and to support Iran in its dispute with the United Arab Emirates over the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. Saleh, a Shia, prayed at the mausoleum of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.[17][18]\n\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq toppled Saddam Hussein and created concern in the region that other leaders would follow suit; as a result, on 15 May 2003, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami visited Iran's two regional allies, Syria and Yemen, to strengthen Iran's regional security links.[19]\n\nIran continued to garner support from Yemen well into December 2010, with Mahmoud Ahmedinejad meeting with Saleh on Iran-Yemen cooperation, whereupon Saleh confirmed his support for Iran's nuclear energy program.[20]\n\nAs the Sunni southern secessionist movement accelerated from 2007 onward, emboldened by Southern Sudan's secession in February 2011, Saleh increasingly turned to Iran for support.[21] Iranian officials see Saleh as critical to preserving Shia rule over formerly independent Sunni South Yemen, which encompasses the strategic port of Aden, and have expressed their support for his crackdown on Sunni southern separatists \"in order to preserve territorial integrity\".[20]\n\nCurrent status\n\n2011 Yemeni protests\n\nMain article: 2011 Yemeni protests\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, protesters demanded Saleh end his three-decade-long rule because of his perceived lack of democratic reform, widespread corruption and the human rights abuses carried out by him and his allies.[22]\n\nOn 2 February 2011, facing a major national uprising, Saleh announced that he would not seek reelection in 2013, but would serve out the remainder of his term.[23] In response to government violence against unarmed protesters, eleven MPs of Saleh's party resigned on 23 February.[24] By 5 March, this number had increased to 13, as well as the addition of two deputy ministers.[25]\n\nOn 10 March, Saleh announced a referendum on a new constitution, separating the executive and legislative powers.[26] On 18 March, at least 52 people were killed and over 200 injured by government forces when unarmed demonstrators were fired upon in the university square in Sana'a. The president claimed that his security forces weren't at the location, and blamed local residents for the massacre.[27]\n\nSaleh fired his entire Cabinet on 20 March 2011, but asked them to remain as a caretaker cabinet until he could form a new government.[28] On 22 March, Saleh warned that any attempt at overthrowing him would result in civil war.[29]\n\nOn 23 April 2011, facing massive nationwide protests, Saleh agreed to step down under a 30-day transition plan in which he would receive immunity from criminal prosecution.[30][31] He stated that he planned to hand power over to his Vice President, Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi as part of the deal.\n\nOn 18 May 2011, he agreed to sign a deal with opposition groups, stipulating that he would resign within a month;[32] On 23 May, Saleh refused to sign the agreement, leading to renewed protests and the withdrawal of the Gulf Cooperation Council from mediation efforts in Yemen.[33][33]\n\nAssassination attempt, aftermath and return\n\nOn 3 June Saleh was injured in an RPG attack on his presidential compound, which killed four body guards and injured the prime minister, deputy prime minister, and the governor of Sanaa. The man responsible for speaking at Saleh's public events was reported killed. Saleh suffered burns and shrapnel injuries, but survived, a result that was confirmed by an audio message he sent to state media in which he condemned the attack, but his voice clearly revealed that he was having difficulty in speaking. Government officials tried to downplay the attack by saying he was lightly wounded. The next day he was taken to a military hospital in Saudi Arabia for treatment.[34] According to U.S. government officials, Saleh suffered a collapsed lung and burns on about 40 percent of his body.[35] A Saudi official said that Saleh has undergone two operations: one to remove the shrapnel and a neurosurgery on his neck.[36]\n\nOn June 4, 2011, Vice President Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi was appointed as acting President, while Saleh remained the President of Yemen.[37]\n\nOn July 7, 2011, Saleh appeared for the first live television appearance since his injury. He appeared badly burned and his arms were both bandaged. In his speech, he welcomed power-sharing but stressed it should be \"within the framework of the constitution and in the framework of the law\".[38]\n\nOn September 19, 2011, he was pictured without bandages, meeting King Abdullah.[39]\n\nOn September 23, 2011, Yemeni state-television announced that Saleh had returned to the country after three months amid increasing turmoil in a week that saw increased gun battles on the streets of Sana'a and more than a 100 deaths.[40]\n\nSaleh said on October 8, 2011, in comments broadcast on Yemeni state television, that he would step down \"in the coming days\". The opposition expressed skepticism, however, and a government minister said Saleh meant that he would leave power under the framework of a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative to transition toward democracy.[41]\n\nSee also\n\nCabinet of Yemen\n\nReferences\n\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh profile from the National Information Center of Yemen, (in French)\n\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh official Yemen government website\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh collected news and commentary at Al Jazeera English\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh collected news and commentary at The Jerusalem Post\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh collected news and commentary at The New York Times\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh at the Notable Names Database\n\nAli Abdullah Saleh Family in Yemen Govt and Business, Jane Novak, Armies of Liberation blog, April 8, 2006\n\nTimeline: Saleh's 32-year rule in Yemen, Reuters, 22 March 2011\n\nIn Yemen, onetime foes united in opposing President Saleh, Sudarsan Raghavan in Sanaa, The Washington Post, 25 March 2011\n\nProfile: Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh, BBC News, 23 April 2011\n\nPolitical offices Preceded by\n\nAbdul Karim Abdullah al-Arashi President of North Yemen\n\n1978–1990 Succeeded by\n\nHimself\n\nas President of Yemen Preceded by\n\nHimself\n\nas President of North Yemen President of Yemen\n\n1990–present Succeeded by\n\nIncumbent Preceded by\n\nHaidar Abu Bakr al-Attas\n\nas President of South Yemen"
