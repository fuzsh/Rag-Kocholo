        "text": "Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] (listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician and leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP). He rose to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later Führer in 1934. During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria—then part of Austria-Hungary—and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support. Hitler sought Lebensraum (\"living space\") for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his longtime lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later, on 30 April 1945, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army; their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims who he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history. Hitler's actions and ideology are almost universally regarded as evil. According to historian Ian Kershaw, \"never in history has such ruination—physical and moral—been associated with the name of one man.\"\n\nAl Sharpton, whose full name is Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr., was born on October 3, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York. He is a renowned American civil rights activist, Baptist minister, television/radio show host, and former White House advisor. Sharpton's interest in activism began at the tender age of four when he was licensed as a Pentecostal minister. His flair for advocacy continued to burgeon during his teenage years as he became the youth director of New York's Operation Breadbasket, an organization focused on promoting economic fairness for African Americans. Sharpton's influence grew in the 1980s and 1990s as he led several high-profile protests that exposed racial and social injustices. He played significant roles in advocating for justice in cases like the Central Park Jogger case, the Crown Heights Riot, and the case of Amadou Diallo, a Guinean immigrant shot by the New York City Police Department. His relentless activism led to the establishment of the National Action Network (NAN) in 1991, an organization dedicated to promoting political and economic justice, maintaining a direct action approach against racism, and providing extensive support to victims of crime. Apart from his activist role, Sharpton has made significant strides in politics and media. In 2004, he sought the Democratic nomination for President, where he used his platform to raise issues affecting African Americans. On the media front, Sharpton had a stint as a radio talk show host before transitioning to television. He hosted PoliticsNation, a night-time talk show on MSNBC, where he discussed American politics and civil rights. Through his multifaceted career, Sharpton has left an indelible mark on American society, solidifying his legacy as a prolific civil rights leader and influential public figure.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy. Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country. Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.\n\nAl Gore, a name synonymous with environmental activism, had his roots in politics. Born on March 31, 1948, Gore was raised in Washington D.C., where he was exposed to the political atmosphere from an early age. His father, Albert Gore Sr., was a U.S. Representative and Senator from Tennessee, a legacy that Al Gore would continue. Graduating with a degree in government from Harvard University in 1969, Gore made his entry into politics as a U.S. Representative in 1976. He served as a representative until 1985, then moved onto the U.S. Senate until 1993. Gore's political career reached its zenith when he became the Vice President of the United States under President Bill Clinton in 1993. He served two terms as Vice President, during which he was deeply involved in several policy decisions, particularly those related to the environment. However, despite his successful political journey, Gore is perhaps best known for his work on climate change. Post his vice-presidency, he dedicated himself to raising awareness about global warming, turning into a global advocate for environmental issues. In 2006, Gore released An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary focusing on the dangers of climate change. This film, which was both critically acclaimed and commercially successful, catapulted Gore to international fame as an environmentalist. His efforts were recognized globally when he was co-awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, alongside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for their collective efforts to disseminate knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for counteracting such change. With a life marked by relentless service, Al Gore stands as a testament to the power of conviction and dedication.\n\nAl Franken, born on May 21, 1951, in New York City, rose to prominence as a comedian, writer, and political commentator before transitioning into politics. A graduate of Harvard University, Franken first gained fame as one of the original writers on the acclaimed television show Saturday Night Live, where he worked from its inception in 1975 until 1980, and again from 1985 to 1995. During his tenure at SNL, Franken won multiple Emmy Awards for his contribution to television writing, further cementing his status as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. Franken's career took a significant turn in 2008 when he was elected as a United States Senator from Minnesota for the Democratic Party. His transition from comedy to politics was notable, as it demonstrated his ability to leverage his platform and influence to impact public policy. Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Franken was known for his progressive stance on issues such as healthcare, education, and climate change. His time in office was marked by his commitment to fighting for middle-class families, championing women's rights, and advocating for clean energy solutions. However, Franken's political career was not without controversy. In 2017, he resigned from the Senate following allegations of sexual misconduct. This event marked a significant setback in Franken's career, leading him to step out of the public eye. Despite this, Franken continues to contribute to societal discourse through various platforms, including hosting a weekly political podcast."
