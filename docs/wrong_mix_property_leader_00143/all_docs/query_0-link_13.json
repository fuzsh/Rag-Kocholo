        "text": "Faruq al-Kamali\n\nMohammed Ben Sallam\n\nThe year 2000 started with holding the Local Council Elections and approving the Election Law plus the formation of the Election Supreme Committee (ESC).\n\nIt also witnessed the formation of a new government, the appointment of new diplomatic missions, as well as members of the Shura Council. In the security field the kidnapping and explosion incidents continued to take place amid several tribal conflicts.\n\nThe September 11 terrorist attack on the WTC heavily cast its shadows on Yemen as 20 soldiers were killed in Mareb during a hunt down of some suspected supporters of al-Qaeda network.\n\nThe tribal clashes repeatedly occurred in areas such as Mareb, Amran, Beidaa, Sanaa and Hajja. The reasons for clashes varied from confrontations over ownership of land to tribal blood feuds, etc. The clashes that took place between Jahm and al-Jedaan tribes in July resulted in the killing of several people from the two sides. The war was also renewed in October as a result of a dispute over a piece of land located between the two tribes.\n\nThe fierce confrontations between Wadeaah and al-Ussaimat tribes in Amran over a piece of land in July and August resulted in the death of 25 people and injury of 100 others. Similar tribal conflicts also took place in different areas of Amran and Hajja claiming the lives of many people.\n\nThe President of the Republic ordered the Shura Council last July to set up an ad hoc committee to tackle tribal feuds, especially after the expansion of the tribal war zone. Later, the committee discussed many issues related to tribal blood feuds and issued many recommendations in this respect, but could not reach a general reconciliation among the warring tribes.\n\nSecurity-related incidents\n\nThe acts of explosions and armed confrontations continued to take place in Aden. Many explosions took place during the new year celebrations of 2001. Three different explosions occurred targeting the night club of the Continental Hotel, the building of the state-owned Saba News Agency and a church, but no casualties were recorded.\n\nIn May, a booby trapped car exploded in Aden while the President was attending the 11th anniversary celebrations of re-unification of Yemen. In the same month a dynamite warehouse exploded in al-Suaida district resulting in the death of 17 persons, the injury of many others plus the destruction of a truck and 11 shops close to the place of the incident.\n\nIn July, 8 persons were killed and 5 others were injured in Sanaa during armed confrontations between Aal Nashtan tribe and persons loyal to Sheikh Abdulah bin Hussein al-Ahmar, speaker of the parliament.\n\nMadbah district in Sanaa witnessed heavy fighting between the residents of the area and some military officials who attempted to forcibly take pieces of land belonging to some citizens. Also, in June fierce armed confrontations took place between the security forces and the retired colonel Yahya al-Muharess and his sons. The clashes killed 5 persons and injured 3 others. Al-Muharess was said to have commanded a gang which had perpetrated tens of crimes.\n\nKidnappings\n\nThe circle of kidnapping continued to take place. The acts of abduction included Yemeni citizens this time. In January an armed group from Bani Dhabian tribe kidnapped the eldest son of the former Mayor of the Capital-Secretariat. The kidnappers demanded the implementation of a number of development projects in their tribal areas. Businessman Ali Mohammed Numan al-Qubati was also abducted in January from the city of Hudeida as a result of a dispute between him and the Military Economic Corporation in Hudeida. At the end of May, al-Zaidi tribes of Mareb kidnapped Carl Christian, a German national, who was studying Arabic in Sanaa, and took him to Mareb. Carl was then released on June 11 after the mediation of some tribal figures. In the same month the same tribe abducted five persons from Sanhan, the hometown of president Saleh. Following the incident contingents of the armed forces heavily shelled the area, where the hostages had been held captive.\n\nOn July 27, a group of al-Zaidi tribe kidnapped the German Commercial attach√©, Rainer Berns, from Sanaa. He was released two months later.\n\nOn 28, a tribal group from al-Zaidi tribe kidnapped German Carl Lienart, 55, to their tribal area in Mareb. The abduction of Mr. Carl coincided with the visit of president Saleh to Germany. Carl was then released on December 8 after a contingent of the Yemeni special forces besieged the hideout of the abductors and arrested one of them.\n\nJabbir Ali Satir failed in February to hijack a Yemenia airplane after the airplane crew foiled his attempt and arrested him.\n\nElections\n\nThe ruling party, General People Congress (GPC), won the local council elections while the Islah party ranked second. Following consultations with the opposition parties, the newly amended Election Law was lastly approved and the ESCwas later formed in November. The ESCincluded 7 members appointed by the President and 15 others who were nominated by the parliament.\n\nNew Government\n\nFollowing the local council elections the new government of Abdulqadir Bajamal was formed on April 4. It replaced the government of Dr. Abdulkareem al-Iryani. The newly appointed government included one female minister, Dr. Waheeba Fareaa who was given the Ministry of Human Rights. Three new ministries were created. These were the Ministry of Human Rights, Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research and the Ministry of Technical Education & Vocational Training.\n\nYemeni-Saudi Relations\n\nThe Yemeni-Saudi relations witnessed good development after the signing of the Jeddah Border Treaty in June 2000. Crown Prince, Abdulah bin Abdulaziz headed a large Saudi delegation in his visit to participate in the anniversary of Yemens reunification celebrations. The visit was followed by president Salehs visit to Riyadh. President Saleh, during his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, repeated his invitations to Saudi businessmen to invest in Yemen, affirming that they would be rendered care and assurances.\n\nSheikh bin Shajea, a leading Sheikh of Dahm tribe, continued warning the German company, entrusted with the demarcation of the Yemeni-Saudi borders, not to approach the borders of his tribe. Dahm tribe claimed that it would be deprived of 10000 km of its land according to the agreed on border treaty.\n\nOn security, the Yemeni-Saudi committee, in charge of implementing the border treaty, held its last meeting in Sanaa last October.\n\nYemen and combating terrorism\n\nThe September 11 incidents have had a strong impact on both the Yemeni people and government. Yemen has already been suffering from terrorism. However, the Yemeni government has been up to the occasion and has denounced all kinds of terrorism including the Israel terror against the Palestinian people. It has also called for extraditing Abu Alhamza Almissri suspected of masterminding acts of terror in Yemen.\n\nWith the view of clarifying the stance of Yemen towards terrorism, President Ali Abdulah Saleh paid visits to Germany and France after holding a summit with the US president George Bush in Washington. President Saleh had earlier pointed out that Yemen was a victim of terrorism and that the Yemeni economy had greatly been affected by the suicide crash against the WTC and the Pentagon on September 11.\n\nIn Brief\n\nJanuary 2001\n\n-Tribes in Mareb seized a number of oil tankers and threatened not to allow any others to go to Mareb.
