        "text": "Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi President of South Yemen\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nQahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi (1920–7 July 1981) (Arabic: قحطان محمد الشعبي‎) was the first President of the People's Republic of South Yemen. Al-Shaabi's National Liberation Front (NLF) political organisation wrested control of the country from the British and won political supremacy over the opposition Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) in 1967. On 30 November 1967, the protectorate of South Arabia was declared independent as the People's Republic of South Yemen with al-Shaabi as President. Al-Shaabi held the presidency until 22 June 1969, when a hard-line Marxist group from within his own NLF seized control. He was replaced by Salim Rubai Ali (Salmin) and jailed, then placed under house arrest until the 1970s, and lived quietly in Aden from his release until his death in 1981.\n\nSouth Yemen independence activists · 4T\n\nPeople from Lahij Governorate · 3T\n\nNasserists · 27T\n\nSalim Rubai Ali President of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen)\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nSalim Rubai Ali (Arabic: سالم ربيع علي; ca. 1935 – 26 June 1978) was the head of state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) from 22 June 1969 until his surrender and execution by firing squad on 26 June 1978. Rubai Ali led the left wing of the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (NF), which forced the British to withdraw from South Arabia on 29 November 1967. Rubai Ali's radicals gained dominance over the more moderate President Qahtan al-Shaabi's elements, allowing Rubai Ali to seize power; he retained the title of Chairman of the Presidential Council throughout his term, even as the NF changed the name of the country from the People's Republic of South Yemen to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1970.\n\nCommunism in Yemen · 8T\n\nYemeni socialists · 7T\n\nYemeni Marxists · 4T\n\nAbdul Qadir Bajamal Yemeni politician (1946–2020)\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nAbdul Qadir Bajamal (Arabic: عبد القادر باجمال‎; February 18, 1946 – September 7, 2020) was the Prime Minister of Yemen from 31 March 2001 to 7 April 2007. He was a member of the General People's Congress party and was appointed as Prime Minister by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Previously he served as Foreign Minister from 1998 to 2001.\n\n2020 deaths · 11,737T\n\nPeople from Sana'a · 40T\n\nGovernment ministers of Yemen · 27T\n\nAbd Al-Rahman Al-Mahrami Yemeni Salafi leader and member of Presidential Leadership Council\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nAbd Al-Rahman Al-Mahrami (Arabic: عبدالرحمن المحرمي: born 1980), known as Abu Zaraa'a Al-Mahrami, is a Yemeni Salafi leader who has served as a member of the Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council since 7 April 2022. He is the commander of the UAE-backed Southern Brigades."
