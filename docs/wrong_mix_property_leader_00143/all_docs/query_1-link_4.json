Most of the fighting has taken place in Sa'dah Governorate in northwestern Yemen although some of the fighting spread to neighbouring governorates Hajjah, 'Amran, al-Jawf and the Saudi province of Jizan.\n\nThe Yemeni government alleged that the Houthis were seeking to overthrow it and to implement Shī‘a religious law. The rebels counter that they are \"defending their community against discrimination\" and government aggression.[44] The Yemeni government has accused Iran of directing and financing the insurgency.[45]\n\nIn August 2009, the Yemeni army launched a fresh offensive against Shia rebels in the northern Sa'ada province. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by the fighting. The conflict took on an international dimension on 4 November 2009 as clashes broke out between the northern rebels and Saudi security forces along the two countries' common border and Saudis launched an anti-Houthi offensive. The rebels accuse Saudi Arabia of supporting the Yemeni government in attacks against them. The Saudi government denied this.[46] Houthi leaders claim that United States involvement in the war started on 14 December when the US launched 28 air raids.[6]\n\nGeneral Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar commanded the Yemeni security forces during the conflict and led all the government offensives from 2004 until 2011, when he resigned his post to defend protesters during the 2011 Yemeni uprising.[47]\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 1962, a revolution in North Yemen ended over 1,000 years of rule by Zaydi Imams, a branch of Shia Islam, who claimed descent from the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad. Sa'dah, in the north, was their main stronghold and since their fall from power the region was largely ignored economically and remains underdeveloped. The Yemeni government has little authority in Saada.[48]\n\nDuring Yemen's 1994 civil war, the Wahhabis, an Islamic group adhering to a strict version of Sunni Islam found in neighboring Saudi Arabia, helped the government in its fight against the secessionist south. Zaydis complain the government has subsequently allowed the Wahabis too strong a voice in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, for its part, worries that strife instigated by the Shia sect so close to Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia could stir up groups in Saudi itself.[48]\n\nAlthough it has received little international coverage, the conflict essentially pits Yemen's Sunni-majority government against Shia fighters, a conflict that has added significance for many Arab countries worried about the rising influence of Shia-ruled Iran.[48]\n\nThe last five years of fighting against the armed Houthi group were sparked in 2004 by the government's attempt to arrest Hussein al-Houthi, a Zaydi religious leader of Shabab Al Mu'mineen and a former parliamentarian on whose head the government had placed a $55,000 bounty.[48]\n\nTimeline[]\n\nRound 1: June–September 2004[]\n\nFrom June to August 2004, government troops battled supporters of al-Houthi in the north.[49] Estimates of the dead range from 500 to 1,000.[30] On September 10, Yemeni forces killed al-Houthi.[50] Since then, the rebellion has been led by one of his brothers, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi.[51] His father, Badr Eddin al-Houthi, took over the position as the group's spiritual leader.[52]\n\nRound 2: March–May 2005[]\n\nBetween March and April 2005, some 1,500 people were killed in a resurgence of fighting between government forces and supporters of the slain cleric.[30]\n\nIn May 2005, the rebels rejected an offer of a presidential pardon by President Ali Abdullah Saleh after their conditions for surrender were refused by the government and minor clashes continued. On May 21, the government released estimates of the impact of the rebellion, announcing that it was responsible for 552 deaths, 2,708 injures, and over USD 270 million in economic damages.[51]\n\nOn, 23 June 2005, the rebels' military commander Abdullah al-Ruzami surrendered to Yemeni authorities. after tribal mediators worked out a deal with the government.[52]\n\nRound 3: November 2005 – early 2006[]\n\nA third round of fighting broke out from November 2005 until early 2006. During this round, the pro-government Hamdan tribe, led by Sheikh Abdullah al-Awjari battled with pro-Houthi tribes and Houthis tried to assassinate a Ministry of Justice official in Dhamar. The fighting was ended before the Presidential elections that year[53] and in March 2006, the Yemeni government freed more than 600 captured Shī‘a fighters.[54] There was no data with regards to casualties in 2006, but they were said to be significantly lower than those of the previous year.[30]\n\nRound 4: January–June 2007[]\n\nA new spate of fighting broke out on January 28, 2007, when militants attacked multiple government installations, killing six soldiers and injuring 20 more.[55][56]\n\nFurther attacks on January 31, left six more soldiers dead and 10 wounded.[57] A further ten soldiers died and 20 were wounded in an attack on an army roadblock near the Saudi Arabian border on February 1.[58] Though there was no official confirmation of militant casualties in the attacks, government sources claim three rebel fighters were killed in a security operation following the January 31 attacks.[59]\n\nIn February, the government launched a major offensive against the rebels involving 30,000 troops.[19] By February 19, almost 200 members of the security forces and over 100 rebels had died in the fighting.[60] A further 160 rebels were killed in the subsequent two weeks.[61] A French student was also killed.[62]\n\nA ceasefire agreement was reached on June 16, 2007. The rebel leaders agreed to lay down arms and go into exile in Qatar (by whom the agreement had been mediated), while the government agreed to release rebel prisoners, help pay for reconstruction and assist with IDPs returning home.[63]\n\nIn total some 1,500 people were killed by the conflict in 2007, including 800 government troops, 600 rebels and 100 civilians.[30]\n\nRound 5: March–July 2008[]\n\nArmed incidents resumed in April 2008, when seven Yemeni soldiers died in a rebel ambush on April 29.[64] On May 2, 15 worshippers were killed and 55 wounded in a bombing at the Bin Salman Mosque in Sa'dah as crowds of people left Friday prayers. The government blamed the rebels for the bombing, but Houthi's group denied being responsible.[44][65] Shortly after the attack, three soldiers and four rebels died in overnight skirmishes.[66]\n\nOn May 12, clashes between Yemeni soldiers and rebels near the border with Saudi Arabia killed 13 soldiers and 26 rebels.[67]\n\nDuring fighting in May 2008, a total of 1,000 government forces were killed and 3,000 injured. Some 70,000 people were displaced by the fighting.[30]\n\nPresident Saleh declared an end to fighting in the northern Sa’dah governorate on July 17, 2008.[68]\n\nRound 6: August 2009 – February 2010[]\n\nMain article: Operation Scorched Earth\n\nYemeni troops, backed by tanks and fighter aircraft, launched a major offensive, code-named Operation Scorched Earth,[69] against the rebel stronghold in northern Yemen on August 11, 2009, after the government promised to use an \"iron fist\" against the rebels. On September 17, more than 80 people were killed in an air raid on a camp for displaced people in northern Yemen.[70]\n\nThe conflict took on an international dimension late in the month. Clashes were reported between the Houthis and Saudi security forces near the border.[71] Also, Yemeni officials captured a boat in the Red Sea that was transporting anti-tank shells and, according to some reports, five Iranian \"instructors\" sent to help the Houthis.[72] Various official Iranian sources responded, calling this claim a politically motivated fabrication, and stating that the ship was traveling for business activities carrying no consignment.[73] In early November the rebels stated that Saudi Arabia was permitting Yemeni army units to launch attacks from across the border at a base in Jabal al-Dukhan, charges which were denied by the Yemeni government.[74] In late October, heavy clashes in the area of Razih led to the Houthis capturing two military headquarters and killing Yemeni commander General Amr Ali Mousa Al-Uuzali[17] In early November, General Ali Salem al-Ameri and regeonal security chief Ahmed Bawazeir were killed in a Houthi ambush as they were returning from Saudi Arabia.[18]\n\nThe conflict spilled into neighbouring Saudi Arabia for the first time since erupting in 2009 on November 4 when rebels shot dead a Saudi security officer in a cross-border attack. The rebels took control of a mountainous section inside Saudi Arabia, in the border region of Jabal al-Dukhan[71] and occupied two villages inside Saudi territory.[75][76] Saudi Arabia’s news agency said that rebels had entered Saudi territory and attacked patrols, and that a second soldier later died from wounds sustained in the same clash.[77][78] On November 5, Saudi Arabia responded by launching heavy air strikes on rebels in northern Yemen, and moved troops nearer the border. Saudi government officials said only that the air force had bombed Yemeni rebels who had seized a border area inside the kingdom, which they said had now been recaptured. The officials said at least 40 rebels had been killed in the fighting. The Saudi government adviser said no decision had yet been taken to send troops across the border, but made clear Riyadh was no longer prepared to tolerate the Yemeni rebels.[77] The Saudi assault continued the following day, as Saudi residents near the southern border of Jizan Province were evacuated.[79] At the same time, a Houthi spokesman reported to the media that they had captured Saudi troops.[80] On 16 November, Yemen killed two Houthi commanders, Abbas Aaida and Abu Haider. On 19 November, Yemeni forces took control of al-Malaheez, killing the local commander Ali al-Qatwani.[81]\n\nHouthi leaders claim that U.S. involvement started on 14 December when the U.S. launched 28 air raids.[6] At least 120 people were killed and 44 injured by the alleged US air raids on the regions of Amran, Hajjah and Sa'dah in North Yemen. New air raids on 18 December killed 63 civilians, including 28 children and injured at least 90 people.[82] U.S. President Barack Obama claimed he had authorised the strikes against al-Qaeda.[83] On 20 December, Saudi air strike killed some civilians. According to a spokesman for the Houthis, a Saudi attack killed 54 people in the town of Al Nadheer in the northern province of Sa'dah. The group also claimed that Saudi forces were advancing on the nearby town of Zawa, also in Sa'dah, and had fired more than 200 shells.[84]\n\nOn December 22, the Houthis stated that they have managed to repulse Saudi Arabian forces trying to infiltrate into the province of Sa'dah, killing an unspecified number of Saudi soldiers in a battle in the border region.[85]\n\nThe fighting between Yemeni and Saudi forces and Houthis killed at least 119 Yemeni government forces, 263 Houthis, 277 civilians and 7 foreign civilians.[30] Saudi casualties were confirmed at 82 at the time.[86] With more soldiers killed in subsequent clashes and missing soldiers being found dead, however, the casualties rose to 133 killed by January 23, 2010. The number of missing was put at six.[34]\n\nIn early January 2010, the Houthis chose the Iranian cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to mediate in their political standoff with the Yemeni government and to find a solution to the conflict. This choice was criticized by Saudi cleric Mohammad al-Arifi, a preacher at Riyadh’s central mosque, who dismissed al-Sistani as “an infidel and debauched.” The remarks by the Saudi cleric were considered extremely insulting by Shi’as around the world, causing major outrage in some Shi'a populated countries like Iraq, Iran and Lebanon.[87][88]\n\nOn January 13, 2010, Operation Blow to the Head was launched in an attempt by the government to capture the city of Sa'adah. Security forces claimed they killed 34 and arrested at least 25 Houthis, as well as killing al-Qaeda in Yemen leader Abdullah al-Mehdar within the next two weeks of fighting.[89]\n\nOn January 25, 2010, the Houthis offered a truce[90] and withdrew from 46 positions which they held in Saudi territory. Houthi leader Abdul Malek al-Houthi said they would stop fighting to prevent further civilian casualties and the withdrawal was a gesture for peace,[91] but warned that if the Saudis were to continue fighting the Houthis would go over into open warfare. A Saudi general announced that the Houthis had stopped fighting and were not on Saudi land anymore and that in response the Saudis also stopped fighting saying, \"The battle has ended by God's will.\" But the Saudi king denied the Houthis had withdrawn saying they were forced out, and declared military victory for the end of their conflict with the Houthis.[92] There have however been allegations that the Saudis launched new air raids on January 29, thus breaking the truce.[93]\n\nOn January 1 the Yemeni government offered a conditional cease-fire. The cease-fire had five conditions which were the re-establishment of safe passage on roads, the surrender of mountain strongholds, a full withdrawal from all local authority property, the return of all military and public equipment seized during hostilities and the release of all the detained civilians and soldiers. On January 30, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi released a video wherein he blamed the government for the recent round of fighting but said that: \"Nevertheless, and for the fourth time, I announce our acceptance of the [government's] five conditions [for an end to the conflict] after the aggression stops ... the ball is now in the other party's court.\"[94] After the truce was accepted on January 30, however, there were still some clashes between the Houthis and both Saudi and Yemeni forces.[95] Therefore, on January 31 the Yemeni government rejected the truce and launched a new round of attacks, killing 24 people.[96]\n\n2010 conflict with pro-government tribes[]\n\nIn April, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam declared that they had captured the Manaba district in Sa'dah and that government forces did not put up much resistance. Government troops declared they had killed 30 Houthis which tried to penetrate into Harf Sufyan District.\n\nOn July 17, 2010, the Houthis warned on their website that the government was preparing for another offensive against the Houthis. They said the government had been digging trenches from the Sana'a to Sa'ada. They claimed the army was trying to amass servicemen in villages and that soldiers in Amshia Bsfian region were creating an army stronghold on Mount Guide. The report came as the Yemeni government blamed Houthi fighters for recent ethnic clashes which had killed 11 people, including two soldiers and for the kidnapping of two people in a market.

Iran, they say, has secretly landed arms on the Red Sea coast. In October, 2009, Yemen’s government said its navy intercepted an arms-carrying Iranian vessel. Yemen’s state-controlled press claims Houthi rebels have been trained in an Iranian-run camp across the Red Sea in Eritrea. Yemen’s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, says members of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hizbullah militia are teaching them. The Yemeni authorities also darkly note that the Houthis’ long-time leader, Hussein al-Houthi, who died in battle in 2004, used to visit Qom, one of Shia Iran’s holiest cities.[155] None of these accusations have yet been borne out by independent observers and the Iranians deny any involvement.\n\nAlarabiya.net quoted well-informed sources as saying that \"the president of the former South Yemen (Ali Salim al-Bidh) conducted a secret visit to the Lebanese capital Beirut last October (2009), and tried to contact figures close to Hizbullah aiming to win its support for the Huthi rebels, and for South (Yemen's) secession.\" The sources added that those Hizbullah-allied figures \"informed al-Bidh that the party's top officials do not want to meet with him and that they do not approve the attribution of Hizbullah's name with what is happening in Yemen, or to appear as supporting to any rebellion.\" Ibrahim al-Mussawi, Head of Hizbullah's Media Unit, told Alarabiya.net that his party denies the report about an alleged secret visit.[156]\n\nHigh-ranking officials from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard were said to have secretly met with Huthi rebels and Hizbullah in Yemen to coordinate joint military operations against Saudi positions along the border. Pan-Arab Asharq al-Awsat daily said Arab and Egyptian sources uncovered that a number of intelligence services in the region have learned of the three-way meeting which also aimed at developing a plan to escalate the military situation along the Saudi-Yemeni border. It said the high-level meeting which took place in November, 2009 was the most prominent evidence of \"direct Iranian involvement\" in the support of Huthi rebels financially, militarily and logistically.[157]\n\nYemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Kurbi on 13 December 2009 urged Iran to crack down on Iranian groups he accused of aiding Huthi rebels in northern Yemen and held Iran's government partly to blame. He said: \"Religious (Shiite) circles and groups in Iran are providing aid to the Huthis,\" However, Iran has repeatedly denied such accusations.[158]\n\nOn 25 May, Iran first deployed warships to the Gulf of Aden to combat piracy in Somalia.[159] On 20 January 2010, On 18 November, a second group of Iranian warships came to the Gulf of Aden, at the same time as Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade on Houthi-controlled coasts and launched a crackdown on Houthi ships delivering weapons to the Houthis.[159] Iran dispatched its 5th fleet to the Gulf of Aden.[160] Some have alleged that the Iranian Navy is operating there to help supply the Houthis with weapons and counter the Saudi naval power in the area rather than to fight Somali pirates.[159]\n\nUnited States[]\n\nOn December 2009, According to The New York Times, the United States has provided weapons and logistical support to Yemeni government strikes against suspected hide-outs of so-called Al Qaeda within its borders. The officials said that the American support was approved by President Obama and came at the request of the Yemeni government.[161] Houthis claimed in a statement that the U.S. has used modern fighter jets and bombers in its offensive against the Yemen fighters.[6]\n\nHouthi leaders however claim that US involvement started on 14 December when the US launched 28 air raids.[6] At least 120 people were killed and 44 injured by the alleged US air raids on the regions of Amran, Hajjah and Sa'ada in North Yemen, a Houthi leader was quoted as saying: \"The US air force perpetrated an appalling massacre against citizens in the north of Yemen as it launched air raids on various populated areas, markets, refugee camps and villages along with Saudi warplanes, The savage crime committed by the US air force shows the real face of the United States. It cancels out much touted American claims of human rights protection, promotion of freedoms of citizens as well as democracy.\"[162] The Houthi claimed that new air raids on 18 December killed 63 civilians, including 28 children and injured at least 90 people.[82]\n\nOn June 17, 2011, following Friday prayers, tens of thousands of protestors rallied in Sa'dah against US interference in Yemen.[163]\n\nThe houthis blamed US intelligence forces of carrying out a bombing in August 2011 which killed 14 Houthi fighters.[123]\n\nOther[]\n\nJordan: It has been alleged that Jordan deployed commandos to fight alongside the Saudis during their offensive in Northern Mount Al-Dukhan and that Saudis sent the Jordanian commandos to fight in Northern Yemen. They also sent auxiliary units to support Saudi forces.[2] By December 2009 it was alleged that over 2,000 Jordanian soldiers were fighting at the front.[4]\n\nMorocco: King Mohammed VI of Morocco is alleged to have sent hundreds of elite fighters, mainly para-troopers to trained for counter-insurgency operations to aid the 2009-2010 Saudi offensive.[4]\n\nPakistan: It was alleged in Pakistani newspapers that the government of Pakistan had sent 300-man Special Forces unit to join Yemeni counter insurgency operations in Sa'dah.[5]\n\nHumanitarian effects[]\n\nIn April 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that the conflict had created 77,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sa'dah Governorate.[164] By order of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the Saudis are to shelter and build 10,000 new homes for the war-displaced people.[165][166][167]\n\nUse of child soldiers[]\n\nMain article: Military use of children\n\nUNICEF and Islamic Relief Worldwide were reported as condemning Al-Houthi rebels for abusing children by forcing them to fight for their cause.[168][169] In November 2009, over 400 children walked to the UNDP office in Sana'a, to protest against Houthi abuse of children's rights.[170] The Yemeni military has also been accused of employing children under 18 in its ranks.[171]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of wars 2003–current\n\nList of modern conflicts in the Middle East\n\nHuman rights in Yemen\n\nMilitary of Yemen\n\nZaidiyyah\n\n2009 South Yemen insurgency\n\n2011 Yemeni protests\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
