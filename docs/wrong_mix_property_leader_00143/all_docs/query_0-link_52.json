Statistical statements to the victims of the Yemeni regime forces: 24 - 128 Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) Annual Report 2011 Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) issued its annual report for 201 1, which is the culmination of the monthly reports of the same year, including an objective assessment of the southern citizen enjoyment level of his rights and his fundamental freedoms, which are guaranteed internationally, and noting the development of such rights in the South Yemen. The process of the monitoring and documentation of human rights violations, which are constitute one of the aimed mechanisms at reducing its commission, and as a method of its protection and encouragement to respect, as well as reservation of guarantees for the rights of victims from the violations, and to deter the perpetrators. Therefore, the Southern Observatory leads his mission that seeks to inform public opinion, domestic and international reality and the reality of the rights and freedoms of the southern citizen under the deterioration of the political and economical situation, which is the citizen its victim, and does not find who protects his rights and freedoms, reminding the pledges international community to protect human rights, especially in light of the circumstances of the state's inability to protect their citizens. Year 2011 witnessed a number of serious violations committed by the forces of the Yemeni regime against the Southern citizen, was formed on the whole real threat to his life and his livelihood and public tranquility. Southern citizen is living today between the jaws of power and violations of the forces of lawlessness horrible. It is exposed daily to the work of repression and torture by those forces. At the same time is no longer comfortable with his life from the persistence of security imbalances and repeated armed incidents, and no trust someone who has a responsibility to protect him. In the absence of safety and security disappear the rest of the rights and freedoms and thus do not reassuring and tranquility of living in general. The southern citizen suffered during the year 2011 many of the deprivation of his rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to freedom of expression, which exposure of hundreds of citizens for killing, detention, repression and torture, because they are spirited way of peaceful demonstrations as a form of expression to collective aspirations for self- determination and the restoration of their independent. We can clarify that violations committed in this year have not been upwards over the previous year, but also cruel and terrible methods of commission. Compared to last year have increased the proportion of deprivation of the right to life \"extrajudicial killings\" to four times and the wound leading to injuries to three different times ('). 1. Introduction: For as long as there was keen to access basic rights and freedoms of the human, the society are life enjoy a safe and stable. And vice versa, the absence of such rights inevitably endangers the lives of that community to degradation and disorder. The stability and evolution of communities is linked to the extent of its rights and fundamental freedoms. This is sought by humanity, which emphasized the need to enjoy their human rights and freedoms to bringing life to ensure a safe See the monthly reports of the Observatory on the web site... http://sohr-aden.org and stable. However, the rights in southern Yemen today is eager passion of his rights and freedoms denied to them over the years, which reflected her absence to lay down his life living and security and stability. The life of the citizen have become subject to the South, surrounded by danger from all sides, whether the security, political, or economic, because of the violations committed against him and persecution by the forces of the Yemeni regime unchecked legal stop or religious scruples or moral limits of them. We have witnessed in 201 1 a surge in the pace of human rights violations in South Yemen as the forces of power not only of committing acts of repression and abuse typical right of citizens of South Yemen, but has stepped up the ferociousness of the commission of many abuses and persecution of serious, innovative techniques emerging in the brutality of the commission, to fall short in describing them to the category of crimes against humanity that were not to the level of crimes genocide ( 2 ). The growing volume of such violations and persecution of gross right of the southern citizen reveals what holds the Yemeni regime of hatred towards the South, and confirms the methodology in the absence of rights, which is indifferent to the legal provisions be it local or international, disguised to its commitments to the international community to respect human rights. With this, the system may be abandoned for those international obligations, and practiced the fraud and slander on the international community as violations of his forces for human rights abuses as an individual, and is not interested in, ( 3 ). And the fact that this system did not succeed in circumventing the international community, and his humanitarian record is naked in the subject of suspicion and contempt,according to the UN Security Council Resolutions No. 2014 in the year of 2011, and the Human Rights Council (a/hrc/res/ 18/19), which has stressed the need for to conduct impartial investigations, independent and comprehensive in line with international standards about the abuses of the violations of human rights, calling on the Yemeni government to respect its international commitments ( 4 ). This is what is called the resort to the Yemeni regime under false pretenses to obtain immunity for the president and his staffs from prosecution ( 5 ). However, the complicity of others is that the project itself is a crime victim to the right to deprive them of their rights, in return for granting the perpetrators to escape from the punishment ( ). 2. Methodology of the monitoring and documentation: The Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has taken on hampered the adoption of monitoring and documenting the violations of the Yemeni forces against the citizens of South Yemen, and reporting to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the international community represented the international human rights protection. It is so revealing light on what committed by Yemeni forces of abuses of power to remain a witness to the horror 6 Definition of crimes against humanity (Rome Declaration of the International Criminal Court). Address by Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Human Rights Council at its eighth century. • UN Security Council Resolution No. 2014 to 201 1. Immunity Act No. 1 of 20 12 ■ - Statement by Human Rights Watch on January 23, 2012 . and cruelty of the commit methods, especially if the regime is working for international control through the media blackout and confusion on the fact and reality and restrictions on civil society organizations from detecting them. The Southern Observatory senses its duty of humanitarian towards the victims of the dead and wounded and arrested . All those who violated the political rights and civil rights, was determined to remove cover of the media blackout and the removal of noise imposed on those violations, and to uncover the truth of what is being done in South Yemen against the citizens. The Southern Observatory manages over the course of two years to contribute his work to clear the situation of human rights in South Yemen, and indicating the behavior of Yemeni authorities against those rights, which is connected to the suffering of victims of these violations against freedom and democracy and human rights in the world. The Southern Observatory is clarifying the source of the truth of what is going on in the South Yemen without discrimination or favoritism, and Pursuing transparency and credibility in the adoption of humanitarian issues. The Southern Observatory issued its annual report for 2011, which is the second annual report, which is based on his information to keep up the daily course of events related to human rights and on the following correspondents and field reports of its activists inside the country (South Yemen), and what it had received from reports of the victims violated their rights, as well as broadcasts and news agencies, newspapers, media and news websites. The monthly reports of the Observatory for the past year was based upon the preparation of this annual report, which is the result of the work of monitoring and documenting over the period from January to December 2011. The Southern Observatory was keen on including in his report a number of persecutions and violations related mainly to political and civil rights, being a high priority because they pose a direct threat to human life, such as murder, injury, arrests, torture, and armed assault on the cities and villages, above the emitters concern over the rights of other economic, social, such as the rights of women and children and discrimination in public office, etc., are also occupies a place in the separate reports. As it notes the apologizing to overcome several cases of violation that occurred during the time period in response to a shortcut, with the possibility of reference within the monthly reports ( 7 ). 3. Cases of violations in 2011: Within the framework of monitoring and documenting the violations committed against the citizens of the South. The Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has been able during the year 2011, monitoring and documentation of 280 violations of the right to life by extrajudicial killings to rise attributed to the three and a half times from last year is set at 77 cases , also documented 784 cases of injured, to increase its rate to three and a half times from last year is set at 237 cases, has also been monitoring and documenting 567 cases of arbitrary arrest long activists of the southern movement was mostly for cases of torture and abuse in the transaction, also was hit 174 units of houses and civilian facilities to cases of destruction of damage degrees. 7 - - To view the monthly reports for the year 201 1, please return to the website of the Observatory under the southern link (( http : //sohr- aden.org) All of these grave violations committed against southern citizens and offered their lives at risk, which refers to the systematic commission of policy followed by the Yemeni regime, and it describes abuses or violations committed individually. This policy is the confirmation of the Yemeni government, which is not respect human rights and to renounce its international obligations towards it. The Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) find it appropriate to call the Office of the United Nations and International supervisory mechanisms to work to stop these gross violations and to defense of human rights in South Yemen and the protection of fundamental freedoms, and to hold the international humanitarian organizations responsible for keeping silent about violations of the Yemeni authorities for those rights and freedoms, and we call them to get off the field of truth and justice for the victims of such violations and bring perpetrators to the international justice. 4. Political background of motivated violations: The political background of the Yemeni regime forces to target the southerners is more serious violations and denial of fundamental rights and freedoms, included in the concepts of varying the nature of relations between the political system in Republic of Yemen and among the citizens of the South, who have had an independent state, which is known internationally, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen entered in the political unit partnership with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1990, which ended in failure and that unit was the result of the Yemeni regime launched the 1994 war by military forces invaded the territory of the South, and they are practiced the policy of occupation ( 8 ), towards its citizens and its territory and wealth. At a time in which the Yemeni political system saw that subjected of the South to its dominance is to strengthen the unity between the two countries, see Southerners that their land is under occupation of the military forces of the Yemeni regime, and it is their right to claim the national project, the departure of those troops and the return of their independent state. While the people of the South are looking to achieve their rights and freedoms of the legitimate national, the Yemeni regime did not pay attention to those aspirations, but he faced the ugliest methods of oppression and abuse. He sees it as a threat to its interests in the South to the annexation of his barn, and that it addresses all which has the power of military and security policies and incentives and intimidation in order to grip on the capabilities of the southerners. To this end, it worked to deprive Southerners from their rights not only civil and political but also economic and social development. And sought to blur the identity of the South historically and culturally, ensuring their privacy, cultural and social, including the courage to change the geopolitical map in the demographics of the South. By contrast, the people of the South held its intention to continue their struggles to extract their legitimate national rights, using method of peaceful struggle. Where the oldest on the organization itself through the mobility of a mass through which the establishment of peaceful - Recognition of Gen. Ali Mohsen in Suhail TV May 2011. events of rallies and protest demonstrations and rallies calling for the right of the people of the South in the enjoyment of all rights of the waste, particularly the right to self-determination and the return of an independent state. They insist on UN Security Council Resolutions numbers 924 and 931 for the year 1994, which remainder all to do not use of force and claim them to resolve differences by peaceful means ( 9 ), and the General Assembly resolution on the right of self- determination ( °). 5. The nature of human rights violations in South Yemen: Steadfastness of the people of the South and their sacrifices for freedom brought the southern issue to the ears of the regional and international community. It has been the case for the South during this year a remarkable understanding of international legitimacy, culminating in the holding of meetings between representatives of many of the international delegations and the leaders of the peaceful southern movement ( ). This comes as a result of international understanding to the suffering of the people of the South from the oppression and the denial of rights, and the results of the security situation and living by the repressive policies of the Yemeni security authorities. In the name of the unit exercised the most heinous methods of persecution, the name of security and violate people's lives, and on behalf of the absence of law the rights and freedoms taken away. There is in the South the law of force rather than the force of law. This encourage others to accounts of their own that also contribute to destabilize security and stability by engaging in violence and intimidation of citizens, in the hope of the return of the citizen to bet on the forces of power again and subservience it, that's what led to the deterioration in the security situation and the disruption of life and suffering of the citizens of collective punishment of electricity, poor water supply and scarcity of materials in the fuel and spare communication and disabilities of the roads ( 12 ). The southern citizen became a victim of those situations in which they are egregious violations of his rights. He is trying to express his rejection of such violations through peaceful protests, and the expression of anger for what he has reached the conditions of personal and home conditions and the deterioration of contempt and inferiority. All of these protests were met with violence and repression excessive, and even using firearms against its participants, and the detention of hundreds for long periods without charges or trial, as has been hidden many of them, and some were tortured while judging others to long prison terms after unfair trials, were killed and wounded hundreds protesters during peaceful protests, but the cities and entire villages have become military targets for the weapons of the armed forces ( 13 ). The Yemeni power forces have worked on chaos in the security situation in the southern provinces, through the creation of a security imbalances, including bombings and shooting 9 - UN Security Council Resolutions 924 and 93 1 numbers for the year 1994. 10 - General Assembly resolution No. 673 for the year 1952. 11 - The meeting with delegates of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the commander Hassan Ba'oum., and a number of leading a delegation of the European Union and the U.S. delegation. - The preamble to Security Council Resolution 2014: \"It expresses its deep concern also about the high numbers of people internally displaced and refugees in Yemen ... and the growing disruption of supplies and basic social services. 13 - Statement, Human Rights Watch on January 23, 2012 . 8 random to terrify the citizens, as well as encourage the phenomenon of carrying weapons, and silence for some actions, if not at the behest of them by some armed groups to tamper with public tranquility and cut off roads and highway robbery of the car and the seizure of private land. This is what the citizens summoned to condemn these behavior to aware of that stands behind it is the authority itself, in order to straining the situation and thus provide a pretext for further repression and abuse ( 14 ). The phenomenon of the spread of the forces of terrorism of armed militias is also affecting on the status of the citizen the South. These groups claim to support Ansar Alshariah, who are also practicing acts contrary to human rights values and morals of the southern citizens, thereby encouraging them to expand the militias in several southern provinces and districts to control the number of cities and villages, and their impact on tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes in order to preserve their lives ( 15 ). With hundreds of people signed the victim of armed clashes between the militias and the forces resisting the authority of the Prosecutor, so that the citizen is the victim of armed violence, which are used the various types of heavy weapons including flights invasive. All of these battles did not result in any wins remember to Army authority, the result is that the civilian population are the main victims of these battles. The size of the civilian victims of such acts by the military forces, stresses that the power did not define human rights standards of any importance, which is committed many serious violations under the pretext of fighting terrorism. In contrast, the armed militias that call themselves \"Ansar Alsharia\" are also practiced violations against the right of citizens, under the pretext of applying the provisions of the law, of extrajudicial killings and cut the hands, as well as terrorize the citizens and subjected to its hegemony. The patriotic opposites of the South and southern public opinion see in these events scenario stands behind the Yemeni regime to direct public opinion, and to regional and international that the South in the case to break ties with it, which will turn to the area of influence of the forces of \"Ansar Alsharia\" associated with membership relations of Al-Qaeda( 16 ). In these conditions, the human rights in southern Yemen is absent entirely, where these conditions pose a real threat on the lives of the southern citizens, and remains the citizen is deprived of its right to security and stability and living reassuring, losing his right to freedom of expression that the event is trying to exercise through peaceful marches face repression and force excessive dispersed, with many cases where firing live bullets on the participants. 6. The reality of human rights in South Yemen: 14 - See message \"National Council of Aden,\" addressed to the Acting President of the Republic on 4 January 20 12 15 - Chairman of the Committee permit relief to the displaced. - Statement of the Supreme Council of the mobility of the peaceful and the people of the cities as well as a statement Jaar and Zanzibar. The Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) expressing concern about the reality of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the South, because the violations of those rights had exceeded the legal character to live up to the crimes against humanity for poor citizens. Year 201 1 witnessed deteriorated situation in all spheres of political, social and economic, which was broken by security conditions unruly, in that the southern provinces turned into scenes of violence and armed attacks by incidents of explosions, assassinations, shooting indiscriminately increased citizens scarier and concern for their lives and tranquility. Also there are a number of districts, which are in the complete absence on the presence of the Yemeni state, if not some of which have been controlled by armed militias of \"Ansar Alsharia\", turned to the squares of a real war, which destroyed buildings and government installations and private, and became the victim the civilian population, who have not been carried out in front of bodies and only driven from their homes and towns to search for safe places. If we turned for the reality of human rights in the South during the year 2011, we conclude following trends: 1) The Yemeni regime is no longer bound by the provisions of the laws passed on the protection of human rights, but that he committed violations of the articles of its constitution the year. The South is not governed by law, because the law is absent in most cases. There is no respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms provided for by the constitution ( 17 ) is not a commitment to the provisions of Criminal Procedure which do not permit the arrest of a citizen without legal justification, but on the contrary, there is a suppression of anyone who tries to claim their rights ( 18 ). 2) The Yemeni government does not respect its international obligations towards itself. They are committed various types of violations without regard to the provisions of international deprive such violations. This is what led the Human Rights Council to call on the Yemeni government to honor their commitments ( 19 ). 3) The approach to the forces of the Yemeni rights and fundamental freedoms of the South became stems from the perspective of hatred and revenge. Foster policies that humiliation, and as a Certified systematically to subjugate the citizens of the South. There is no punishment or accountability for the perpetrators of violations ( 20 ). 17 - Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. And Article 172 of the Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Yemen, No. 1 3 of 1 994. 1 8 - Assurances of the Minister of Human Rights, Ms. nymph known in an interview with the newspaper \"26 September\" on January 26, 2012 AD, \"the existence of a large gap between legal provisions and their application to the land of the facts, emphasizing that human rights in Yemen and in violation of wasted.\" \"- Human Rights Council resolution at its eighteenth number a/hrc/res/ 18/19 20 - Aden News Agency \"about us\" February 8 .. Said a communique issued by the Monitoring Committee and follow-up in the peaceful movement in Hadramaut that \"every official and popular, which intervened in the case of a detainee Hussein Kassar I thought that the report Fahad Al-Haj, acting director of the Criminal Investigation Department Shahr and who has close family relationship with the Minister of Interior will receive his punishment, but the opposite happened, where still Fahad Al-Hajj out of the hands of justice and enjoys his freedom, while still detained Kassar in prison. \" 4) The gross violations of human rights in South Yemen, has exceeded its size and nature of such a grave to live up to the level of crimes against humanity. The murders have increased and extrajudicial ferocity and cruelty, but those offenses are committed by targeting directly during marches and peaceful events. 5) The use of the Yemeni armed forces to some of the bombing of cities and villages in the southern Yemen as a terrorist attacks, putting their lives at risk real, and pushes them to flee in search of places to save their lives harbored that have become unprotected. According to the International Classification it is genocide against civilians ( 21 ). 6) There is an increase in the size of human rights violations compared to last year, as the method of committing cruelty and ferocity of his masters. The reasons for this return to the hysterical and the loss of the system to go haywire due to the continued escalation of the protests by the People of the Southern Movement. 7) The human rights exposed most violent in the South, under the pretext of \"fighting terrorism\". And are about the authorities do not assess the weight of international standards for the protection of human rights during counter terrorist acts which fell causing hundreds of civilian casualties, and thousands of people displaced from their towns, and serious harm in their homes and their property, where the air strikes and artillery shelling the civilian population of children and women and the elders. 7. Immunity law as Adoption of committing abuses: Aware of the Yemeni regime for atrocity, which is committed serious violations of the rights and freedoms. For a peaceful approach to the revolutionary, and an escape from what could be interpreted to him his fate, the turned the system to save his passing of the law to protects themselves, so that the oldest of the Yemeni Parliament to pass a law giving the President the system and his immunity from prosecution at the local level enabling them to evade punishment ( 22 ), disguised as per the principles of justice and fairness and to all human and moral values, exceeding the rights of victims and guardians of blood right in particular, and abandoning the right of society, as well as the provisions of the law and domestic laws and international conventions, which do not allow the perpetrators of impunity, including the UN Security Council Resolution No. 2014 to the year 2011, on Yemen which stressed the need for a thorough investigation independent and impartial. Also the perspective of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations emphasized on not granting any immunity to ensure full accountability ( 23 ). This procedure is to disregard the right of victims of criminal offenses against human rights. This law loss the victims' rights, and the people of the south has expressed his rejection of him. 21 - See the definition of genocide. (Wikipedia), the free encyclopedia. As well as (the Rome Declaration of the International Criminal Court). 22 - Immunity law No. (1) for the year 20 12. 23 - UN Security Council Resolution 2014 to 201 1. The Southern Observatory is seen in this law, a dangerous precedent, and reflects the extent of the tyranny of this system on the rights of the people as a whole. It committed against this people, creating an impression among Arab public opinion and international community ( 24 ). The existence of a reference to that \"the law of a sovereign,\" have been inventing a new field in the science of jurisprudence, has never found that the law above the Constitution, but the Constitution is the sovereign law only, as it derives directly from the nation's sovereignly, sovereign absolute. The constitution is social contract is the property of the nation which is approved and issued. Therefore, the law of immunity loss of sovereign status, and thus it is to have lost its legitimacy. And an explanation of what could result in the law of immunity, the issue is an explicit recognition of the existence of gross violations of human rights, and that recognition of both embraced the same that covered by the immunity committing these violations, and therefore this recognition in danger of legal repercussions in international courts, the fact that provisions of the law of immunity has closed the door to resort to means of redress and for thus victims of human rights the right to refer directly to the international courts ( 25 ). The Southern Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) expressed in a statement on the issuance of this law, for retaining the right to adopt the rights of all victims of violations of human rights before the international community, so as to bring the perpetrators to just punishment. It also renewed its conviction to give the President of the Yemeni regime the immunity to escape from punishment at the local level. As a disregard of the blood and pain and suffering of victims of human rights violations, not approved by any law and do not even moral or human law. It noted that the rule of legality and legal emphasizes the invalidity of any law or agreement contrary to the principles of justice and fairness of mind, what if they are related to the blood of man ((what is built on falsehood is false)) ( 26 ). 8. Areas of human rights violations in South Yemen: * Deprivation the right to life by killing and wound extrajudicial: There were many methods of killing by Yemeni forces: direct method of killing, indiscriminate killings, bombings, sniper fire and shelling houses. As an examples: what happened to the citizen Sadia Abdulsatar Al Moktov in the city of Almukalla - Hadhrami on 13 January 201 1 by the kit military, as well as the young Visan Ahmed Bakhit, who run over by a military patrol on 16 January 2011. 24 - Jamal Bin Omar the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Yemen said \"the decision of the Security Council in Yemeni affairs did not give any of the immunities one but urged the punishment of officials involved in the murders and the like.\" See \"Eden of Tomorrow\" on December 13, 201 1. 25 - Permit Ms. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as the statement of the human eye and Wright Watch on January 29, 2012 AD. - See Observatory statement issued on January 1 1, 2012 concerning the law of immunity. The Yemeni authority forces in is steering mechanisms deadly to the issuance of the southern movement of peaceful activists, describing them as \"separatists.\" Where the crimes claimed during the current year 2011: 346 cases of dead and 722 cases of offensive injured. The victims were involved in peaceful protests, or were victims of indiscriminate shelling of their homes. All of those cases took place without justification requires committed, and the victims were not on alert pose a threat to the perpetrators. Despite the Yemeni forces progress on the commission without prior warning, and without resort to the methods of deterring non-lethal to control those protests or dispersed, but is sure that the forces power is used snipers to target the southern movement activists during their participation in peaceful demonstrations, such as what happened to the martyr Radfan Mans on Tuesday 21 June, as well as the young woman Kwaiah Alamudi on the 28 October 2011. Although the crimes are forbidden, and denounce the human conscience, but the perpetrators remain out of control and are not held accountable for what they had done, and reported them, the judicial authorities are the other does not care about those communications and do not open an investigation around her, though she had to so they do not provide follow-up serious for the perpetrators to bring them to justice, such as what is happening with the issue of Martyr Ahmed Darwish. Southern families of the victims in most cases do not dare to report them, for fear of what could be done to them from harm, in addition to the certainty that their communications that are useless., The fact that power is power no matter how varied functions, and in many cases it is prevented funeral bodies Martyrs only under certain conditions, as what happened to Martyrs Jalal Nasir, though the funeral, and what happened to the funeral of the martyr Ahmed Darwish on June 24, cite the impact of Dr. Giap Ali Alsaadi and 24 wounded participants, and also the funeral of the martyr Hamid Hussein Hamid and RamziHamadoun on 16 August 201 1, and many others. - Many cases is prevented Offered First Aid, by shooting, and many of them have died because of bleeding the blood of their injuries, as an example: what happened to the young martyr Hail Walid Hail the sons Almualla - Aden. Also the number of the wounded are arrested, such as what happened to the wounded Saleh Abdel Basset Alshuhiri and the wounded Ahmed Mohamed Farag and Mohamed Alkazmi. And some of the wounded are being detained in hospitals from medical, such as what happened to the injured Nasser Ali Alkathi and the wounded, Ali Hassan Al-Saadi, without regard for the sanctity of the hospital or wounded in the right treatment.

On Thursday, March 31th, mass demonstrations took in solidarity with the families and relatives of the victims over south Yemen with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people who chanted slogans condemning terrorism in all its forms waving black banners and pictures of the victims and the state flags of the South. The protesters called the international community to form an independent international investigation committee to investigate this and other crimes conducted by the regime of Sanaa particularly the massacre of the village of Almaajalah which took place in December 2009 and claimed the lives of dozens of innocent victims as a result of the bombing of Aero. The Southern Observatory for Human Rights has already communicated this to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and other international humanitarian organizations asking them to conduct an international investigation to investigate Incinerator of factory October 7th for ammunition. * Doubtful suffocating gas used against protesters: The human rights activist Ahmed Rabezy, reported fainting suffered by young demonstrators in the city of Aden as a result of tear gas fired by security forces.

It is denied by the international laws as a gross violation of human rights and the perpetrator should not escape punishment . This kind of violation is very often committed by the regime forces as collective punishment against the peaceful movement activists and their supporters. This act of violations and arrogance are free from the most basic legal procedures and the result is that the victims remain without legal protection and often with unknown destiny or place of detention. Southern citizens are today at high risk of arrest and deprivation of liberty in the case of the participation at peaceful protest activities. Detention facilities in southern Yemen were full of detainees pending their support for the peaceful national movement. So that the security forces use arrest campaigns even in the middle of the night in search of activists and their supporters causing fear and panic among families, children and people in the neighborhood. This year, wide campaigns of arrests affected many of the leaders and activists of the southern movement as well as many opinion makers, journalists and writers, hundreds of southern citizens were arrested without distinction between a man and woman or between adults and children, such as the child Mahyoub Abdul Aziz, aged fifteen years. While prisons are filled with political detainees, the authorities deny the existence of political prisoners, however, at the same time release of some of them. It also does not disclose the number of detainees, the places of detention or the reasons for their imprisonment. A lot of the detainees were distributed to prisons and detention centers with of multiple criminals. As the detention is not in accordance with clear bases some of the detainees are released after a short period and some others after longer period of detention without charge, including the detainee Mohammed Jamaan Auhan, detained for more than eight months without a specific charge. While others are released after being forced to sign written pledges to deprive them from practicing their political activities in order to use this against them later and bring them to trial as violation of these commitments. To stress here, that many of the detainees have been subjected to physical and psychological torture as well as severe and degrading treatment. Detainees were interrogated in the middle of the night and blindfolded, transferred from one place to another without informing them about the name of the transferee. Also, many of whom have been deprived of medical examination or medical care or even visit from family members and other most basic rights. Many of the detainees has nothing to set aginst such violations but to declare a hunger strike, such action was used e.g. by the detainee, Mahmoud Mohammed Junaid, and many others. An example of such violations committed by the regime forces against the leaders, activists and supporters of the peaceful southern movement are the leader Hassan Ahmed Ba'oom, president of the Supreme Council of the Southern Movement who spent ten months in detention, deprived of basic rights, including visit of family members and health care. The network \"spectrum of news\" cited an unnamed senior security member in Sanaa, \"that his health continues to deteriorate seriously as a result of his need for urgent surgery in one of his legs, where an iron stab was put to him in Egypt last year and that this may lead to his death, especially that he was suffering from chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Hi is at the age of more than 70 years \"(). The Southern Observatory for Human Rights appealed on Friday, April 22nd, to the international humanitarian organizations urging them to intervene for the immediate release of the leader Ba'oom, to save his life from. On Saturday 26 February, security forces launched a campaign of arrests on some leaders of the southern movement who were at the house of Ali bin Ali Shukri in the and arrested him and Ambassador Qassim Askar, Dr. Yahya Shaif Shuaibi, Dr. Aidroos Yahr and Dr. Salah Abdul- Khaliq. According to disclosure by the Council of the peaceful southern movement in the province of Hadramaut, it was found that there were 81 detainees, including many children and elderly held in solitary power without legal protection, knowing that the authorities refused to disclose the true number of detainees, which is according to the website \"Echo of Eden\" much higher. (See the statistical detection of detainees annex). The Web site, \"Mareb Press\" reported that a delegation representing human rights organizations briefed on the situation of political and other prisoners in the central prison of the city of Mukalla revealed the bad state of prison conditions and that detainees and other prisoners deprived of rights set forth legally, suffered from coarse transactions and malnutrition . They complained of prolonged imprisonment despite the expiration of their sentences suffered a lot, especially detainees of the southern movement. Investigations showed evidence of tortures on their bodies of detainees, as the human rights activist, Fouad Rashid, a member of the delegation of human rights organizations visiting the prison, confirmed. He and his colleagues considered the central Mukalla prison as the worst prison in the country, lacking the most locally and internationally recognized basic humanitarian standards. Aden News agency reported that the security forces stationed in the northern entrance of the city of Aden arrested on Friday, the first of April, Dr. Ali Jarallah YafI, media officer of the Supreme Council of the peaceful southern movement as he was leaving the city of Aden towards his residence in Alfayoush, Lahj. On Thursday, November 17, security forces arrested the leader in the southern movement, Sheikh Hassan Bannan Aldyuli, member of the presidency of the Supreme Council of the peaceful southern movement. He, two of his bodyguards and two further persons, Khaled Saleh Muzahim and Hydra Juneidi, were arrested during their presence in the town of Sheikh Othman. * Physical torture to death: Acts of torture, whether physical or psychological, as well as degrading treatment are internationally prohibited and the Yemeni government has to respect this. However, many activists of the southern movement were exposed to various types of torture and abusive treatment. In many cases torture resulted in to death. As examples of this: Tawfiq Hamdi, southern soldier in the traffic police was killed in Aden on Monday, January 17 after being arrested and tortured in prison Criminal Investigation Directorate Department Khormaksar, as reported by Aden News Agency. Mohammed Awad, the son of a worker from the city of Mukalla, Hadramout governorate died on Thursday, October 20, in the prison of the Criminal Investigation Directorate of Mukalla in mysterious circumstances. Aden news agency reported that Mohammed Awad was picked up from his home a week before his death. The prison administration remained silent about the reasons for his death, knowing that the prison is famous for his acts of torture committed against southerner detainees. The political activist Mutee Naji Annaqeeb died on Sunday, April 17 in the city of Zanzibar as a result of the physical and psychological torture throughout the period of his arrest from February last year. The 20 years old student Salim Said Bahisama who was studying engineering in India died on November 19, under mysterious circumstances in a political security prison after two months of his detention arbitrary during his visit to Yemen according to the site \"Mareb Press\". According to his Father and family, he did not suffer from any disease. * The use of hunger strike by the detainees: Because detainees are deprived of basic rights of political prisoners, subjected to torture, psychological pressure, transactions and prohibition of access to legal counsel and prevention of visits by family members, political detainees are forced to seek strike as a way to express their protest. As an example, it was announced that the detainees in the prison of the city of Mukalla on Saturday, 26 March, started hunger strike to protest against the transactions. The Web site, \"Sada Aden\" reported that the families of those arrested southern activists, Sail Ahmed Basidik, Fadhl Mohammed Alsalahi, Salem Fadel al-Abadi, Abdullah al-Jabri, Zaki Ahmed Saleh, Abu Bakr Said Saad and others, pointed out that the detainees will not stop the hunger strike until their release and holding to account those who arrested them without charge. They appealed to human rights organizations to intervene to save their lives. Sail Basidik was seen in prison insisting to remain on hunger strike while the family of Alsalahi said that the authorities will be held responsibility for deterioration of his health condition due to the hunger strike. ; Cases of abductions and enforced disappearances: Violation of the right to live in security and safety became very common in South Yemen especially for political activists and supporters of the southern movement. Kidnapping of a political opponent and hiding them is reported very often. This practice was condemned by the Universal Declaration of the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances that any act of enforced disappearance \"is considered a crime punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their extreme seriousness in the eyes of the criminal law (). Despite the criminalization of international law as well as the Yemeni constitution abductions and enforced disappearance, the security forces of the ruling political authority continuously resort to kidnappings and forced disappearances of southern political activists. We present in this space some violations in kidnapping and enforced disappearances of activists of the Southern Movement: Sheikh Mohammed Abed Rabbo Al Mansouri, Head of the Council of the wounded peaceful movement Bayhan Department was kidnapped on Friday, February 1 1 , by Authority forces, in the city of Crater from the province of Aden and was taken to an unknown destination, accompanied by six members of the province of Dalh. The lawyer Natheer Hassan appealed to local and international human rights organizations to urgent intervention and pressure on the Yemeni government to uncover the fate of a wounded activist who was kidnapped by Yemeni forces from the hospital in Aden. Hassan stated in a press release published by the agency news of Aden \"Anna\" Tuesday, 8 February, that the Yemeni security forces carried out on Wednesday the wounded Bassam Sayel Bin Muheisen from the Republic Hospital in Aden and took him to an unknown destination. Adding that the wounded Bassam underwent surgery on the same day he was kidnapped and was still in critical condition because of a gunshot on his abdomen by the Yemeni army in Habilain city on 20 January. The Yemeni Organization for Defending Rights and Democratic Freedoms considered that the citizens Jabl Nasser Alsammi, Mohammed Hassan Madram, Saleh Ahmed Ali, Nasser Al-Qadi, Ali Daraan Saleh, Waddah Mohammed Saleh Alasbahi, Waddah Saleh Mohsen Almshadli are among the persons disappeared involuntarily. In a communication on Wednesday, March 2, was mentioned that they were arrested without a warrant or call by any officials, taken to an unknown destination or informing their families about their stay. However, the security services denied knowing where they were. • Violations of the right of collective expression and suppression of peaceful demonstrations: The freedom of expression is a fundamental human right recognized internationally through which people are able to communicate their opinions and beliefs to others. This right can be practiced through a variety of ways, individually or collectively, directly or indirectly, through writing or audio. There are no restrictions limiting the enjoyment of this right which reflects the real human freedom. It was agreed that the international community would consider any violation of this right a crime whose perpetrators should not escape punishment. The regime forces of Yemen, which provides a crude way to suppress demonstrations of the southern who try to express their opinions in an organized events which face repression, violence and excessive force is not with deadly shooting. Several international organizations calling for freedom and defense of human rights to expressed their disapproval of what committed by the regime forces of Yemen. The European Union mission in Yemen condemned \"the use of violence against peaceful protesters, calling on the Yemeni authorities to stop attacks of security forces and armed groups supporting the government against peaceful protesters\". In the city of Almansura, a peaceful march rallies attended by hundreds of young people of the city was launched on Thursday 22 February and walked around the main street towards the central market of the city. Authority security forces fired live bullets and tear gas into demonstrators and launched a campaign of arrests in their ranks. In the city of Habilain, armed elements belonging to the ruling party fired live bullets on Wednesday, March 23, a student march calling \"Freedom for the South\". Children were wounded among them one called \"Radfan\" as reported on by \"Sada Aden\". On the first Tuesday of March, started a mass student march in the city of Sayun and walked around the city streets towards the historic Sayun Palace. Aden news agency said that the security forces began firing live bullets on them and tear gas on the protestors injuring six of them. Security force supported by tanks and armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers attacked on Monday, December 12, the \"Square of demonstrations\" in Khormaxer where activists and supporter of the southern movement began a sit. The website \"Altaif ' reported that Yemeni security forces deployed troops along the place to prevent thousands of supporters of the \"Southern Movement\" from participation in the sit. They fired live bullets and tear gas and used water cannons, injuring a numerous of young protesters. Later on, hundreds of young people gathered on the Square and removed the picture of the Yemeni president and raised the flags of the previous State of South Yemen and named the square \"Independence Square\". » Armed attacks and the bombing of safe cities and villages: Repeated armed attacks on some of the cities and villages throughout South Yemen last year caused severe damages in particular the cities of Jiaar and Zanzibar from the province of Abyan, which are under the control of militia, the so-called \"supporters of sharia\". The Authority forces also attacked these two cities several times increasing the demolition of living quarters under the pretext of fighting terrorism disregarding all human rights standards particularly by air strikes that do not distinguish between civilians and militant persons. An intensive aerial bombardment was carried out by the Yemeni Air Force on Wednesday, September 7, causing the death of two girls from the city of Jiaar. The Web site, \"Aden Alghad\" reported that the shelling had targeted residential neighborhoods, government buildings and public markets and many other civilian facilities including the Institute for Health Sciences, Hotel \"Track\", local bank and a primary school and. This caused the displacement of dozens of families outside the city of Jiaar. In addition to dozens of families who were displaced two days earlier after the air strikes that resulted in at least 13 dead civilians. The number of displaced families to the province of Aden, which stretched schools and camps, reached 108 000 according to official resources. The real number is expected to be higher as many families joint their relatives and therefore were not included in the official statistic. The city of Habilain and other cities/ villages of the Directorate of Radfan were exposed different times of the year to armed attacks repeatedly using various types of heavy weapons in the bombing which led to killing and wounding several people in the region including children and women and damaging many private and public buildings. It was difficult for the inhabitants to bear a safe life, in contradiction; the practices of the regime forces have struck terror and fear among the people. At the morning of Tuesday, December 6, military aircraft flew over the city of Abyan penetrating the sound barrier, raising fear and terror among, as reported by Aden news agency. » displaced of Abyan province call for relief: We cannot miss it here to recall the suffering of the people of the cities of Jiaar, and Zanzibar. The people of those two southern cities suffered from loss of home, security, poverty and destitution in their lives. Their homes were bombed and the services they were expecting from the government to survive were provided. There is no electricity, no water or only rarely, no fuel or any basic services and communications. However, the silence is applied on them from all the local, regional and international levels. In a letter sent by the people of the two cities to the public, was metnioned that \"we hold the remnants of the regime in Sana'a full responsibility for what is happening in the province of Abyan, the killing of innocent children, women and elders and the displacement of the population, destroying homes and destruction of farms as well as continue the siege for several months without fault of their own\", asking for help to save them from perdition. The Southern Observatory Has transmitted their appeal to the ears of the international organizations, calling for aid and help to relieve this plight and save their lives. The responsibility lies with everyone, without hesitation or lingered to prevent a humanitarian disaster as a result of the suffering of the people in an area where no government or humanitarian organizations can save them . » Restrictions on press freedom and attacks on the journalists: Press freedom is an internationally guaranteed right and the press is customary acknowledged as the fourth power. It reflects the real course of the society and observes the attitude of the authorities and their respect to low and its practice. Therefore, restricting the freedom of press is not covered by law and its violation is an illegal act punishable by law. However, the press and journalists in South Yemen had been during the current year has been exposed to many violations, many journalists were arrested, tortured and subjected to trial and prosecution. Furthermore, newspapers and publications were confiscated, also, many websites were closed and many editors exposed to humiliation, harassment and threats. All of this reflects the lack of respect to press by the Yemeni authorities especially against the southerner journalists, newspapers and websites when which covered the activities of Southern Movement. Newspaper \" Alayyam\" that represented the pulse of the southern Street, is still closed since mid- 2009 awaiting the decision of the governing authorities after reveal of false allegations presented to the trial which is proceedings for more than two years. The security authorities have failed to achieve their goal in the conviction of the newspaper publisher and journalist Hisham Bashraheel. At the same time, the veteran journalist Hisham Bashraheel is still subjected to many violations of his rights and his professional life. On Monday, 10 January, security forces arrested the journalist Fuad Rashid, the former assistant editor of the newspaper \" Almasallah\" while he was covering a mass demonstration organized by women in the city of Mukalla demanding the release of political detainees. It is worth mentioning that the journalist Fuad Rashid has established a news website known as the \"Mukalla Press\" which covers the events of the southern movement. The International Committee to Protect Journalists has already requested the Yemeni authorities to release Fuad Rashid. On Saturday, January 15, the security forces fired on the journalists Bint Almukmal and \"Abu Muhammad Al-Hadrami\", correspondents of the TV channel \"Aden Live\", known as pro- Southern Movement channel during their coverage of the funeral ceremony of martyr Musada Al-Makhtuf who was killed by the military crushed kit.

They were using wireless phones used by members of intelligence units and political security services. They robbed him ten thousand riyals, a memory card, CD-ROM and a university books. On Sunday, April 10, the web site \"Adenalghad\" reported that the Yemeni security service established a special unit which mission is to break down news websites of the peaceful Southern Movement and websites of Yemeni oppositional parties. The budget of this unit was supposed to be more than $ 5 million. Abu Omar Al-Yaf i, managing editor of Aden Times news website told that his web site was attacked on Saturday, April 9 attack from pirate calling himself \"Hacker of the youth of Al-Tagheer\".

On Tuesday 25 June, security forces arrested in the province of Lahj the foreign journalists Jan Oron Johnson, 29 years old, and holding a New Zealand passport. He entered Yemen illegally through Somalia. The \"Al-Arabiya Net\" reported that the authorities had already deported some foreign journalists. Noting that in the fifteenth of last March, six foreign journalists were deported according to a statement of the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate, including Oliver Holmes (British journalist) who works for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"Time Magazine U.S.\", Healy Sotiland Edward (American journalist) who works for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Joshua Martic (photographer U.S.) and Portia Walker (British press), who work for the \"Washington Post\" and \"Matlgraf ' and Patrick Sims (American journalist) who work for \"Outside Magazine\" and Marcoda Lauro, an Italian photographer. 9. Recommendations: - The Southern Observatory for Human Rights sees that to stop the in South Yemen violations and to defend on their right to self-determination. This right guaranteed by international conventions, and adopted by the international community is a sacred right of the people. - It believes that the political issue of South containing among other fundamental rights and freedoms of the people in the South Yemen. It is right to be dealt according to its political background and international legitimacy. Therefore, the Southern Observatory calls Yemeni government to recognize the southern issue in accordance with the realities of political and international legitimacy, and to meet the requirements of that recognition, to give people the southern right to self-determination. - Freedom of expression is a fundamental right, so the Southern Observatory calls Yemeni government to stop firing of live bullets at the demonstrators and not to use excessive force against peaceful demonstrations. And it calls them to bring the shooters on the participants to justice, and to granting the lucrative compensation to those affected. - We call also on the Yemeni government to release all political prisoners at the disposal of the Southern Movement, and among them the leaders of the southern movement, Sheikh Hassan Banan member of the presidency of the Supreme Council of the southern movement of the peaceful liberation, and Ahmed Omar Almarkashi. And we call them open an investigation of each of the crimes of torture against the political prisoners. - The Southern Observatory strongly condemns all military attacks on the cities and villages of the South, and calls Yemeni government to stop immediately these acts, and holding perpetrators accountable, and fair compensation for those affected by them. It also calls them to return its armed forces to their barracks and raise the points of military and security on public roads and not to the militarization of civilian life for citizens. - We call on the Yemeni government not to restrict the press and journalists, and to giving them the freedom of expression without restrictions or pressure, and to revoke the suspension decision of Alayam newspaper and other newspapers and online news sites. - We call on the Yemeni government to fulfill its international obligations towards human rights, and to respect the freedoms of the southern citizens, and not restricting them to express their political rights and civil rights, including their right to self-determination. - We call upon the High Commissioner for Human Rights of United Nations, and other international organizations concerned with the defense of human rights that pays special attention to the human rights situation in the South Yemen. And at a time after our alerting the High Commission recommendation of our annual report for last year and it goes ahead and opened an office in Sana'a, so we call them to do not use the office to provide logistical support, but to grant him a full term to ensure the monitoring violations, and to open a branch in the governorate of Aden,(South Yemen), through which the citizens can be assured the international control on the fundamental rights and freedoms. - After failing of the Yemeni government in the formation of a national commission to investigate the violations under the Human Rights Council resolution at its eighteenth number A/HRC/ 18/21, so the Southern Observatory calls on the international community to adopt the recommendation of the work the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Judge formation of a neutral, transparent and independent international commission to investigation all violations committed in South Yemen, and to consider it as a mechanism, which can be relied upon in not escape the perpetrators of such violations of punishment . We point to the view that the Yemeni regime forces had committed violations against the people of South, which is shameful in particular the killing and wound extra-judicial arrests and enforced disappearances and torture. 10 .
