        "text": "Five Italians taken hostage by tribesmen in Yemen were released unharmed early today after six days in captivity.\n\nThe three Italian women and two men were rescued when government troops cornered the six kidnappers and forced them to surrender.\n\nThe gunmen had seized the tourists on Sunday in the Marib region, 75 miles north-east of the capital Sana'a, in an attempt to force the government to release detained members of their al-Zaydi tribe.\n\nWithin hours, the kidnappers were persuaded to release the three women, but they refused to go until their male companions were also freed.\n\nAfter their release, the five were flown straight to Sana'a, where they appeared looking pale and exhausted but otherwise in good health. They will return to Italy \"as soon as possible\", an Italian government spokeswoman said. Italian media said they would probably arrive home tomorrow.\n\nOne of the freed hostages, Maura Tonetto, said that after a night on the move, the kidnappers found themselves surrounded by Yemeni government forces and gave up quickly.\n\n\"During the past 24 hours, we were moving from one mountain to another and then we were put inside a hut with two kidnappers while the other four were going out to check the situation,\" she said.\n\n\"Finally at around 5am, we heard firing and the noise of a helicopter. When the kidnappers saw the government troops moving in, two of them, who were armed with Kalashnikovs, held the rifles above their heads and then put them down on the ground. The soldiers arrested the kidnappers and took them to the helicopter.\"\n\nAnother of the women, Patrizia Rossi, said that even though they had not been physically harmed, their captors had pointed machine guns at them and were \"always threatening\".\n\n\"When we saw we had been freed, there was a total [emotional] breakdown [among the hostages],\" she said.\n\nThe Yemeni prime minister, Abdul Qadir Bajamal, had initially announced that the government would not negotiate with the kidnappers, but it pursued the dual policy of military pressure and negotiation through tribal mediators.\n\nEarlier this week, the government deployed a large number of troops, backed by helicopters, around the kidnappers' district and cut off water supplies.\n\nThe kidnappers objected to the encroaching troops and threatened to kill the hostages if the government used force. It is thought they became discouraged when the chiefs of the al-Zaydi tribe came out against the abduction.\n\nTribal mediator Jebal Teanan, who first announced the hostages' release, said one of the six kidnappers, Marai al-Amiri, was a member of the local district council.\n\nThe Italian government thanked the Yemeni authorities for their handling of the situation and relatives of the hostages were jubilant at the news they had been freed.\n\n\"We're thrilled,\" Luca Bottillo, son of released hostage Enzo Bottillo, told the Apcom news agency. \"I found out from my mother, then the foreign ministry confirmed it.\"\n\nTribesmen often resort to kidnapping to try to force concessions from the government in Yemen. Hostages are normally released unharmed, but several were killed in 2000 when Yemeni soldiers carried out a botched attempt to free them."
