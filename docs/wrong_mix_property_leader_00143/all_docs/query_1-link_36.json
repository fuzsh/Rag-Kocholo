Unlike Ibrahim, who became computer literate in a short period of time, his older colleagues at the ministry rely on younger fellow workers to help them complete their tasks.\n\nThe government's plans for training Yemeni civil servants on basic computer skills in order to keep them abreast to best practices in information technology (IT), as well as modernize their institutions, began in the 1980s, when other parts of the world were also going electronic. Although Yemen is still lagging in terms of producing an \"on-line\" population, with only about 15 percent of its population having access to Internet, this issue is not the major obstacle that has prevented Yemeni civil servants from using technology to complete their tasks.\n\nSome say there is an age gap. Mohammed Mahdi, 27, a reporter working for the government-run Yemen TV channel, said computers are available, but only young people use them. In spite of being trained properly in computer skills, the majority of employees over the age of 45 continue to deal with papers, Mahdi said.\n\n\"They are unwilling or unable to deal with computers,\" he said. Mahdi thinks it's generational and having not grown up with computers, many find them intimidating. Mahdi, who usually helps his older colleagues to complete computer-related tasks, said his older colleagues \"feel embarrassed for being unable to deal with computers, so they resort to papers,\" and then their younger colleagues enter the data into computers.\n\nThe National Data Center, in a report published in 2010, said 80 percent of the state-run institutions in Yemen have been computerized but that doesn't mean people are necessarily accepting of the technology. Mohammed Murshed, 49, has a supervisory role at the Ministry of Youth. His job does not require a computer, but he has received training courses. However, he still isn't able to operate a keyboard with a sense of efficiency. \"If I need to type a letter, I ask my colleagues for help,\" he said.\"I write it down on paper and then it is typed up.\" Murshed is not alone sticking to this traditional way. Lots of the government employees say they have only dealt with handwritten documents their entire government careers.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the National Data Center in 2001, about 25,000 people, including the computer operators, work in the IT job market, a number that is likely much higher now. The center attributed the increase of the workforce in this sector to the high number of graduates in computer science fields as well as the rise in computer training courses. Yet in spite of this progress, the government only recently gained complete Internet access in all ministry buildings in Sana'a in 2009, when the Yemeni government began to create web pages for the state-run institutions.\n\nOne shortcoming of this service, called \"electronic gates,\" is that the pages are not interactive. Citizens do not easily have access to information through the \"gates.\" If anyone needs to obtain official information, it has to be done through a personal request at a governmental institution and then the information is released on paper.\n\nA project called the \"Electronic Government\" was launched in 2003, during the premiership of Abdulqadir Bajamal, with an estimated budget of $60 million. The project was supposed to electronically provide civilian services like applying for identification cards, but the project ultimately failed in large part due to a lack of trained staff, those behind the project say. In 2012, the Yemeni government decided to revive the project and implement it in 2014-2015.\n\n\"The [success of the] strategy depends on the training the state employees will receive to deal with technology and the Internet,\" said Engineer Ahmed Al-Awjari, the head of the executive team for the Electronic Gate Project, which launched the ministries' websites.\n\nHowever, Al-Awjari does not see the problem of computer illiteracy among state employees as the only problem though. He said, even with trained employees, dealing with a population who are not computer literate and looking for information can be a huge headache.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Al-Awjari said the government could build centers to offer electronic services.\n\n\"We are keen to employ young people in such centers,\" he said. \"They can be a medium between the illiterate citizens and the government.\"\n\nCopyright Yemen Times.
