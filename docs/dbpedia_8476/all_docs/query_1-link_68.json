        "text": "The South West has long been an inspiration for writers and\n\nfilm-makers so why not\n\nfollow in their footsteps and explore some literary landscapes when you visit?\n\nThe height of Poldark fever might be over now, but the series has gained Cornwall many new fans with its beautiful filming locations, ranging from the spectacular coves in the far south west to the rugged beauty of Bodmin moor. Charlestown harbour has featured prominently - especially in the last series, but you may also recognise it from many other productions including The Eagle has Landed, Hornblower & Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca, to name just a few.\n\nDaphne Du Maurier is one of the regions most famous writers, and tales of smuggling in Jamaica Inn were not only set at the famous inn near Bodmin, but the Inn and surrounding Bodmin Moor has been used for filming for 3 different versions of her story - including the original Hitchcock version. Most recently, the area around Hartland in North Devon has been used for filming of a new Netflix version of Rebecca.\n\nClovelly and the Hartland peninsula have also been the star of many other TV and film productions. Explore the grounds of Hartland Abbey and you will find Blackpool Mill Cottage - used in the BBC productions of Sense and Sensibility and The Night Manager. You may also recognise Clovelly's beautiful cobbled streets & harbour from the recent film Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society (the majority of which was filmed in various North Devon locations).\n\nFurther down the coast, Port Isaac is a must visit for Doc Martin fans, as the main filming location for the series which is now in its 15th year! Spring is usually a good time to visit if you want to catch them filming. Port Isaac is also home to the (now famous) shanty singers The Fisherman's Friends - and you can still hear them sing on the Platt during the summer.\n\nLocal stories have long been a source of inspiration, with the legend of a Black Dog at Hound Tor on Dartmoor inspiring Arthur Conan Doyle's Hound of The Baskervilles. A drive across the moors towards the prison at Princetown on a foggy Dartmoor day will get you into the Sherlock Holmes spirit!\n\nDartmoor is also home to the pretty village of Iddesleigh, more famous as the home of Michael Morpurgo's War Horse. Inspired by stories told in his local pub (The Duke of York - also does great food by the way!) by WW1 veterans, the story of War Horse was largely based on a neighbouring family farm. The farm is now the site of The War Horse Valley Country Farm Park.\n\nWant more ideas?\n\nExplore Lorna Doone country in Exmoor, including the lovely villages of Lynton & Lynmouth.\n\nFollow the Tarka Trail to explore the rivers where Henry Williamson set Tarka the Otter."
