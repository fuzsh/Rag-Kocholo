        "text": "Having set his own standards, Alfred Hitchcock must be judged by them; and, by them, his \"Jamaica Inn\" (at the Rivoli) is merely journeyman melodrama, good enough of its kind, but almost entirely devoid of those felicitous turns of camera phrasing, the sudden gleams of wicked humor, the diabolically casual accumulation of suspense which characterize his best pictures. Without them, Hitchcock is still a good director, imaginative and cinema-wise, but with no more individuality than a dozen others in his field and subject, like them, to the risk of having a mere actor run away with the film.That had never happened to Hitchcock before. His pictures always were his. But \"Jamaica Inn\" will not be remembered as a Hitchcock picture, but as a Charles Laughton picture. It bears the Laughton stamp as unmistakably as \"The Thirty-nine Steps\" bore Hitch's. Perhaps that is the root of the evil, if it is an evil. For Hitch never faced a player his size before (and we're not thinking only of gross tonnage). With two such stalwart individualists battling on a bare sound stage they might have come to a draw. But Laughton had more than weight on his side: he is co-owner of the producing firm, Mayflower Productions, and in the film he wears costume and a putty nose. No director can spot Mr. Laughton a putty nose and still hope to lead him by it.With Laughton setting the pace then, which is jolly enough, though slower than Hitch would have ordered it, \"Jamaica Inn\" has become a pardonably free translation of Daphne Du Maurier's romantic novel about the disreputable tavern on the Cornish coast in the eighteenth century where an innocent country girl, seeking her Aunt Patience, found herself in a den of ship-wreckers and murderers led by her uncle under the secret patronage of the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan. The unmasking of the squire (who loves nice things—and never lets us forget the strain of insanity in the Pengallan breed) is a matter less of suspense than of straightforward narration, but the tale-spinning has been glib and picturesque.Mr. Laughton's relish of the squire—it was a clergyman in the novel, but no matter—is infectious. Conscious as we were that he was overplaying him unashamedly, there is that to Mr. Laughton's ogling, lip-pursing, strutting, nostril-dilating style which makes the offense altogether endearing. We can't recall when we've ever held a monster in such complete affection. But, of course, Mr. Laughton's Laughtonism has slowed things down. He is such a bulky man to get into motion. We had the impression, as the film rolled on, of Hitch rushing the action to his doorstep and then having to wait three or four minutes for Laughton to answer the bell. Actually, the wait must have told more on Hitch than it did on us.There are other virtues. Maureen O'Hara, who is lovely, has played Mary Yellen well this side of ingenue hysteria, with charming naturalness and poise, with even a trace of self-control in her screams. Leslie Banks is capital as Joss Merlyn, the wrecker ringleader, with a fine crew of cutthroats around him—Emlyn Williams, Wylie Watson, Edwin Greenwood among them. Marie Ney as the girl's aunt, Robert Newton as the undercover man, George Curzon as one of Sir Humphrey's blanker friends are splendid in their degree. We enjoyed it all, Mr. Laughton most, but it doesn't seem like Hitchcock.\n\nJAMAICA INN, based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier; screen play by Sidney Gilliat and Joan Harrison; dialogue by Mr. Gilliat; continuity by Alma Reville, with additional dialogue by J.

For the surprising success of this operation, the young principals, Jackie Cooper and Betty Field, must be liberally credited, but to our perhaps biased eyes the real protagonist of the piece, the center and cynosure, the dramaturgic proscenium who holds the entire fragile structure together by his absolute comical rightness, is Vaughan Glaser, from the original stage production.Mr. Glaser's inspired portrait of an elderly high school principal—the weary dignity, the monumental patience (which has seen every possible form of bad boy, heard every possible excuse), the pedagogical deliberation (not unmixed with hamminess), the taste for neatly turned and rhetorically conclusive sentences, the ability to strip a lying pupil to the skin with ruthless professional logic—is not only the most perfect comical characterization of the year, but is something encountered only once or twice in a generation. So flawless has Mr. Glaser become, by dint of long polishing at his performance (\"What a Life\" played for a year and four months on Broadway), that there is something almost eternal about his conception of Mr. Bradley. If you have gone as far as high school in your academic studies, you will remble in your boots when Mr. Glaser speaks, or looks at you over the tops of his bifocals.In various other ways—in the absence of the false emphasis of stardom, for instance—\"What a Life\" comports itself more like a segment from adolescent scholastic life than like a movie. A humorously exaggerated and commercially canny segment, it goes without saying, but nevertheless an authentic segment. A problem boy with an unlimited capacity for getting in Dutch (isn't he all of us?); the handsomest and brightest student (who, gratifyingly, turns out to be a tuba stealer); the prettiest girl (after she removes her brace)—what more convincing characters could one demand for sheer, stark, gripping drama?Betty Field, who is also from the cast of the stage play, is nostalgically charming and high-schoolish; like Mr. Glaser, she is a tribute to Mr. Abbott's casting genius. Jackie Cooper, who perhaps has too much movie experience behind him, is still adequate as Henry Aldrich, the perennial scapegoat. But if you think \"What a Life\" is the only good comedy on the Paramount program, we advise you to grip the sides of your chair and sit through Russ Morgan's orchestra (don't weaken, no matter what happens) till you reach the miraculous haven of Jimmy Durante, who, in some ways, we insist, is the funniest man in the world. And if you don't think so, even after sitting through a swing orchestra, there must be something funny about you.\n\nAt the ParamountWHAT A LIFE, screen play by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder based on the Play by Clifford Goldsmith; directed by Theodore Reed; a Paramount production.Henry Aldrich . . . . .

Nora CecilJust the faintest shadow of \"The Thin Man\"—and of two collateral predecessors—is being cast by the little mystery-comedy, now at Loew's Criterion, name of \"Fast and Furious.\" But this time it is the detective team of Joel and Garda Sloane which is doing the gagging and sleuthing; and, in the roles of Joel and Garda S., it is not Melvin Douglas and Florence Rice, as it was in \"Fast Company,\" which was the first in the Sloane & Co. Detective Agency series, nor is it Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell, as it was in \"Fast and Loose,\" the second. It is Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern. So the shadow is very, very faint.In other words, Metro seems to be stretching an original idea to infinity—a suspicion which is practically confirmed by the plot of \"Fast and Furious.\" It is a perfect specimen of unoriginal attenuation—all about the gay young detective and his wife who get mixed up in a shadily run beauty contest, which results in a couple of murders, a couple of limp comedy situations and an interminable lot of chasing about leading nowhere. Mr. Tone and Miss Sothern banter through it in the manner of third-string substitutes who know that the game is hopelessly lost."
