        "text": "To males of a certain age, one of the indelible images of the early 1960s was Ursula Andress rising out of an azure sea onto a perfect white sliver of beach. She wore a white bikini and a knife on a belt. That was, of course, inDr. No, the first James Bond film. As a student in cold and gray New England, I was thinking not just, “Who is that?,” but also, “Where is that?” I had never even been on a plane, but this looked like exactly where I wanted to go. That beach scene became my definitive tropical fantasy. Whenever I turn a corner and hit a blast of cold winter wind, it pops up still.\n\nDr. No was set in Jamaica, and that scene was shot on its sleepy, lush northeast coast, just east of Ocho Rios. This part of Jamaica, the parishes of Portland and St. Mary’s, is often nowadays referred to as “The Other Jamaica,” presumably to distance it from the part with all the murders—sections of Kingston, the capital—and the part with the cruise ships, ganja touts, and loud mega-resorts. That part includes the likes of Sandals and Hedonism II (“breaking the boundaries of other nudist resorts”). Jamaica is a large island, about the size of Connecticut, and has room for a variety of places. I’ve been going to “the other Jamaica” for more than 30 years now.\n\nIan Fleming lived just up the beach from thatDr. No scene, at his estate, Goldeneye. He went there every winter to write a James Bond novel. Today, Goldeneye is an exceptional, boutique-size resort hotel run by music-business legend and pioneering hotelier Chris Blackwell. He founded Island Records and was the guy who made Bob Marley the first international reggae star. Marley bought Goldeneye from Ian Fleming’s estate in the late 1970s, and sold it to Blackwell in 1981.\n\nJamaica was a British colony until 1962. After World War II, it developed a reputation not just for peace and warmth, but also as a place to escape the sexual and artistic uptightness of England and North America—a bit of Tangier in the Caribbean. It drew a heady mix of the first-generation jet set: Graham Greene, Truman Capote, Lucian Freud, Peter O’Toole, Sophia Loren, and Audrey Hepburn among them. Near Ian Fleming lived Noël Coward, who had a home, Blue Harbor, as well as a hillside retreat called Firefly. Further east, in Port Antonio, lived Errol Flynn. He arrived in swashbuckler style when his yacht docked in Kingston during a storm in the 1940s, and decided to stay on. Flynn proclaimed Port Antonio to be more beautiful than any woman he had known. He purchased a hotel and a ranch and—local legend has it—won Navy Island in Port Antonio’s harbor in a rum-fuelled card game.\n\nJamaica offered these A-list visitors a vibrant social scene with a good bit of mischief: cocktails, adultery, ganja, even nude bathing in Coward’s pool. There were also adventures aplenty to be had in the mountains and rivers along the series of stunning bays that run up and down the coast. Nothing in the Caribbean could compare, and it was entirely under the mainstream radar.\n\nThe scene got a boost in 1960, when Garfield Weston, a Canadian cookie manufacturer, opened the exclusive Frenchman’s Cove Resort on a 45-acre property set around one of Jamaica’s most beautiful beaches, just east of Port Antonio. Said to be the first all-inclusive resort in the world, it was, as one magazine article from 1971 put it in a headline, “Only for the Very, Very Rich.” It was reported to cost a whopping $1,650 a week back then, with a two-week minimum that included everything under the Jamaican sun; caviar, fine wine, a personal chef, transportation, water sports, laundry. Frenchman’s Cove was a landscaped tropical fantasy set along the sea with 18 secluded cottages, called “homes,” made of hand-hewn coral stone with copper roofs. No cars were allowed; instead, each guest was given an electric golf cart. Cash was not allowed to change hands. It was written that a staff of 120 served a maximum of 72 guests. Most visitors stayed a month, and it was booked solidly for years. Guests included Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Jackie Gleason, Dean Martin, and Queen Elizabeth: “the right kind of people,” according to Grainger Weston, Garfield’s son, who ran the resort. Adjacent to Frenchman’s was San San, a then elite residential enclave, where Baron von Thyssen and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan had large estates.\n\nAll this had wound to an end by the mid-70s, when Michael Manley, Jamaica’s prime minister, began to champion an in-your-face form of socialism, regularly praising his northern neighbor, Fidel Castro. Radicals declared, “Tourism is whorism.” The economy sank, lawlessness rose, and tourists and capital took flight. Jamaica became a much rougher place. Out with Noel Coward. In with “Get Up, Stand Up” and “The Harder They Come.” As the rise of reggae defined a new Jamaican cultural identity, the country entered a difficult period. Musicians began streaming in—the Stones, the Clash, Johnny Cash, Paul Simon—but the jet set moved to new hot spots, such as Mustique and St. Barth’s. When tourists did return, they came back mostly to the new beach resorts, which kept foreigners locked safely away from Jamaica and the Jamaicans.\n\nThe good news is that, 40 years on, little has changed on the northeast coast. A new main road was built, but that’s about it. The area is still mind-blowingly gorgeous and very rural, and people are wonderfully friendly. It is the older, slower Caribbean of yesteryear. Hand-made signs advertise rum shacks like the First and Last Bar and the Wet Dream Bar. The sign for Frenchman’s Cove, now a shadow of its former self, stands battered and rusted in an overgrown gully. Port Antonio, colorful but with no gift shops and few tourists in sight, has the character of an African town. The landscape is overpowering, dense and jungle-like, in iridescent green. This “Other Jamaica” has stayed stuck in time while much of the rest of the Caribbean has leaped forward. According to the Caribbean Journal, tourism in places like Barbados and the Bahamas now accounts for 40 to 50 percent of their G.D.P.s. Places like St. Maarten are already considered over-developed. Many smaller islands are as tourist-reliant as theme parks.\n\nToday in Jamaica, a determined group of entrepreneurs is betting that the retro, easy-in-the-islands, way-off-the-beaten-track charm of the northeast make it ripe for a subtle revival. They sense a market for more adventurous travelers seeking a Caribbean alternative whose delights are relatively tourist-free. These folks have begun to build a new network of fashionable hotels and restaurants, are happy to organize “bespoke” excursions for their visitors, and cleverly play on the high-level glamour of the old days.\n\nTake the new, private-jet-friendly Ian Fleming International Airport, in Oracabessa. It is just a couple of miles from Chris Blackwell’s chic Goldeneye. Blackwell, who once led the revival of another once forgotten destination, Miami’s South Beach, has been the original catalyst and booster for this Jamaica. Rather than lock people away, his hotel properties celebrate Jamaica’s culture, music, food and drink, and natural beauty, along with its famous low-key vibe.\n\nIn more remote Port Antonio, a protégé of Blackwell’s, Jon Baker, an English music businessman, began a one-man resurgence in what locals call “Portie.” Charming, creative, and energetic, with his tattoos and oversize glasses, he almost seems like a character from a Guy Richie movie. Baker helped create the new Errol Flynn Marina there and in 2005 transformed his property in San San into a small, award-winning hotel and recording studio, called GeeJam. The hotel T-shirt, which proclaims “It Ain’t About the Golf,” aptly sums up the mentality of people willing to drive three hours from Kingston on twisting roads through the Blue Mountains. With partners Steve Beaver (yet another music veteran) and Michael Lee-Chin (an international businessman and Port Antonio native), Baker just renovated the classic old Trident Hotel into 13 luxurious villas and is beginning work to transform its eccentric neighbor, the Trident Castle, an architectural oddity rented in the past to music groups like Arcade Fire. Baker is also restoring the rundown villas that cling to the verdant hillsides of San San, to expand the community of eccentrics there. Buy or rent, Baker will manage the upkeep and keep the supply lines open.\n\nI went back to Port Antonio for a week in April. I stayed at the Trident, hit their new jazz club, and ate at GeeJam. One of the great pleasures was slowly cruising the pot-holed back roads in my rental car. The scenery was among the most beautiful I have ever seen. All in all, it was quite a trip down memory lane for me. One day I drove to Frenchman’s Cove’s small idyllic beach. After these many years, the man at the gate actually remembered me and let me in for free. At the corner of the beach, a small river empties into the sea. Hanging there on an almond tree at the river’s last bend was a small rope to swing on, Tarzan-style. It was the same rope I watched my two children playing on for hours decades ago. Another day, I drove into the mountains and hiked and swam up a river behind Reach Falls through a rainforest. The high point was rafting down the Rio Grande from the Blue Mountains through bamboo groves and banana fields to the sea, a trip first popularized by Errol Flynn. Halfway down I stopped for a coconut-curried crayfish lunch and over-proof rum punch at a stand run by a woman named Belinda. I had known her mother, Betty, when she ran it. Washing off with a swim in the crystal-clear river afterwards, I marveled that I had all this to myself.\n\nThe larger delight is just being somewhere that hasn’t changed. How rare these days. The storied characters of yesteryear have long left the scene (except Noel Coward, who is buried on a hillside at Firefly) but the beauty they came for remains intact and unspoiled. One day I met up with Luke Flynn, Errol’s handsome and very able 30-something grandson. He drove me up to the family’s farm and showed me his grandfather’s home, high up on a hill. Designed by the same architect responsible for Frenchman’s Cove, it’s mid-50s modern—tasteful, but now a carcass of its former grand self, ravaged by hurricanes, windows blown out, and riddled with mold and wasp nests. I noticed a door off the upstairs barroom that opened right over the pool. No stairs. Probably much used in its day. Luke’s grandmother, Patrice Flynn, had just passed away, and Luke seemed energized by the prospect of rebuilding the 2,000-acre property into an exclusive retreat along the lines of what Blackwell has done with Goldeneye. In another sign of things to come, Andrew Chapman, the restaurateur behind Harlem’s hot Red Rooster eatery, just purchased the Aga Khan’s Ti Amo property on nine acres in San San and is redeveloping seven of the villas there into what he says will be “a jungle spa with a culinary sensibility.” Like others, he finds the beauty and the lack of tourists and commercialism in Portland “something very magical.”\n\nJon Baker seems a man possessed as he runs nonstop from one project to another, sensing his dream may actually be coming to pass. Uptown Kingston’s creative class and many an A-list musician are regulars now, and this new scene is more musical than literary. Rihanna, Katy Perry, John Legend, Alicia Keys, Dave Stewart, and many others have booked into Baker’s tropical studio. When I got back to New York, I caught Snoop Dogg in a documentary, taking his turn in northeast Jamaica and pondering a conversion to Rastafarianism. He seemed pretty happy. Fifty years on, the scene may be a bit more Dr. Dre than Dr. No, but the allure is what it always was."
