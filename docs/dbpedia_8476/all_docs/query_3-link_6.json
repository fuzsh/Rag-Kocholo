We drink some Lemongrass tea on the deck while listening to the sound of waves against the cliff below and we are tempted to take a dip in the sea.\n\nThe Turtle Watch\n\nOne thing we missed, as we weren’t in the right season, but a must see if you are:\n\nThe Turtle Watch: Experience the miracle of watching and helping to ensure that a nest of baby turtles make their safe passage to see. This is a once in a lifetime experience for many and the most active months for hatchings are August, September and October.\n\nA night to remember\n\nThe evening comes and a memorable night follows. Dining at the outdoor restaurant crossing the beach with 15 other guests, we drink, we laugh, hear good and hilarious stories, the food is delicious and all that with the music of a merry Jamaican band covering old famous songs in the background. This is a night to remember!\n\nThis article was about Jamaica, Jamaica Inn resorts and spa.
