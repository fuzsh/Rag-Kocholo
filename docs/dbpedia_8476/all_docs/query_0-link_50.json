Your Personal Information\n\nWe will use the personal information you provide us in connection with your stay, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n\n2. Guests\n\nHotel guests are permitted to bring guests with them to the property, although please be aware that during very busy times we may have to restrict guest access to certain areas of the Hotel at our discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, Hotel guests must follow the on-site guest policy as it relates to use of the pool. Guests may not enter the Hotel without a Hotel guest being present. Hotel guests are responsible for ensuring their guests follow all Hotel rules and policies, and can be asked to leave the Hotel if their guests violate such rules or policies. Hotel guests should not congregate in groups of more than 6 within the Hotel unless such group is associated with a pre-booked event at the Hotel.\n\n3. Privacy for Guests\n\nGuests and patrons must not disturb or solicit others in the Hotel with whom they are not personally acquainted.\n\n4. Audio/Video Sound\n\nAny audio and video, including, but not limited to, movies, videos, songs, music, internet calls, presentations and all other audio must only be played through headphones and should not be audible to any other guest present. Internet calls must only take place in designated areas. Music, television, and all other entertainment enjoyed in guest rooms should not be audible outside of the room. All music at the Hotel will be volume controlled by the Hotel.\n\n5. Press/Social Media\n\nUnless otherwise agreed to in writing between the Hotel and a guest, the Hotel operates a strict no press policy both on and off the hotel premises. Hotel guests will be held accountable if they or their guests disclose or identify any other guests who are in the Hotel without their permission, whether in any press or social media including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and on personal blogs.\n\n6. Illegal Drugs/Substances/Items\n\nNo Hotel guest or patron shall purchase, use, ingest, possess, sell or otherwise distribute illegal drugs or other substances, or attempt to do any of the same. No Hotel guest or patron shall ask any Hotel staff for illegal drugs or other substances while on Hotel premises, or in the immediate vicinity thereof. If any of the actions above prove true, the relevant Hotel guest or patron will be removed from the Hotel.\n\nNo guest or patron shall purchase, sell, use or possess any object which is dangerous, illegal or offensive while on Hotel premises or in the immediate vicinity thereof, including, but not limited to, firearms and weapons.

No animals or pets are permitted in restaurants, or in bar spaces at the Hotel except for trained service animals. Guests are solely responsible for any damages and/or cleaning costs caused by their animals.\n\n8. Accidents and Injuries\n\nWe want all our guests to relax and enjoy the activities and facilities available at our Hotels. Hotel guests agree to observe the Hotel rules and any signs published or displayed at our Hotels at any time; to only swim in designated areas; to only use all facilities, including but not limited to, the pool and gym during the posted hours of operation; and to take reasonable precautions when traveling around the grounds or using the facilities at the Hotel.\n\nIf a guest has an accident or suffers any injury at the Hotel, please report this as soon as possible to a member of staff and, in any event, within 24 hours of the incident.\n\n9.

Hotel reserves the right to prohibit or limit smoking in any area of the Hotel premises at any time at its sole and absolute discretion. Any violation of this policy is subject to a smoking fee and/or removal from the Hotel.\n\nThis policy is not intended to stop people from smoking, but to regulate where they smoke and how it affects others. Hotel reserves the right to designate certain outside areas of the Hotel premises as smoking areas and to change the location of such areas at any time. However, all guests are requested to respect the wishes of other guests with respect to smoking, and to refrain from smoking when requested to do so.\n\n11. Noxious Odors\n\nAny items that cause a strong smell, including but not limited to, candles, incense, essential oils (including diffusers and vaporizers) or any other items or fragrances are strictly prohibited.
