Mary is forced to move into Jamaica Inn with her aunt Patience after her mother dies. But her aunt is under the spell of her brutal husband, Joss, and Mary soon discovers Jamaica Inn is the centre of a smuggling ring.\n\nThe three-part series airs over consecutive nights and also stars Joanne Whalley, Shirley Henderson, Sean Harris and Matthew McNulty.\n\nJamaica Inn is on BBC One on Monday 21, Tuesday 22 and Wednesday 23 April at 9pm.\n\nWatch the trailer for Jamaica Inn below:"
