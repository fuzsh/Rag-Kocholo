        "text": "From Doc Martin to Poldark, Cornwall is a star\n\nThe list of Cornwall film locations is quite extensive. Whereas Doc Martin, Fisherman’s Friends, Wycliffe and Ladies in Lavender are set amongst pretty village locations; Rebecca, Jamaica Inn and Poldark tap into the stunning rugged coastline and desolate native moorland.\n\nCornwall’s beautiful scenery has been used as a backdrop to a number of high-profile films and tv series, the earliest known to be in 1899 when Manacle Rocks near the Lizard became the focus of a short black and white documentary film called Wreck of S.S. Paris. Within a short amount of time, Cornwall was being promoted as a holiday destination reachable on the new steam train line operated by Great Western Railways and the silent black and white documentary film Scenes in the Cornish Riviera was promoted in 1904.\n\nThe first really famous film to be shot in Cornwall was Alfred Hitchcock’s interpretation of Daphne Du Maurier’s tale of smuggling: Jamaica Inn. The original was filmed at Bolventor on Bodmin Moor, the location of the famous Jamaica Inn Coaching Inn. The novel proved so popular that a television series starring Jane Seymour was made in 1983, and another adaptation in 2014, which led to criticism of the mumbled Cornish accent! This adaptation was also filmed around the real Jamaica Inn and various sites on Bodmin with the beach scenes taking place around Newquay.\n\nScenes from George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon were filmed on Holywell Bay beach in Newquay.\n\nSimilarly, Cornish-born author Rosamunde Pilcher saw two of her novels come to life when Coming Home was filmed for television in 1988 and The Shell Seekers in 1989, which was subsequently remade in 2006.\n\nIn recreating the Nancherrow Estate and the complex story of Coming Home a number of different locations were used including Prideaux Place in Padstow, Lamorna, Penzance, Porthgwarra Godrevy, Lelant, Marazion and St Michael’s Mount.\n\nRosamunde Pilcher’s best-selling novel, The Shell Seekers included scenes at Port Isaac, Padstow and St Michael’s Mount. The original television series starred Angela Landsbury as Penelope Keeling, with Vanessa Redgrave taking the role in the remake.\n\nAlthough not Cornish inhabitants, Mary Wesley and Susan Howatch authors of The Camomile Lawn and Penmarric respectively, were drawn to the county.\n\nThe Camomile Lawn depicts the beautiful Roseland Peninsula and was adapted for television and released in 1992 with a cast of notable actors including Felicity Kendal and Tara Fitzgerald. Broom Parc House in Veryan, and the village of Portloe, both on The Roseland Peninsula were used as film locations.\n\nPenmarric, which was screened in 1979 uses the locations of Botallack and St Just in order to make the most of the Cornish tin mines, telling a tale of deception fuelled by a promised inheritance.\n\nCharlestown features in many films and television series. The historic 18th-century harbour, complete with its authentic tall ships, makes for an easy adaptation to yesteryear. Mansfield Park was filmed there in 1999 and Moll Flanders (1996), The Eagle Has Landed (1976) and the famous television series, The Onedin Line (1971), all used the harbour for some of their scenic locations.\n\nThe Three Musketeers (1993) made use of the harbour along with the picturesque locations of Polzeath, Lanhydrock House, Boconnoc, Pelyn and Pentire.\n\nHornblower (2002), also made use of the harbour, Falmouth, Pendennis Castle, St Mawes and Rame Head.\n\nNewquay became the backdrop for the television series Echo Beach, with Jason Donavan and Martine McCutcheon in the lead roles. The town has also had bit parts in its fair share of films including The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour (1967), The Eagle Has Landed (1976), an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches (1990) and in the surf film Blue Juice (1995). Just down the road from Newquay at Watergate Bay, The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns was filmed in 1999.\n\nCornwall’s rugged cliffs and soulful sea have set the tone for many a haunting tale. The Mystery of the Marie Celeste was filmed in Falmouth in 1935, followed by the The Uninvited in 1944. The much criticised and controversial film, Straw Dogs (1971) starring Dustin Hoffman, was filmed at Lamorna and St Buryan, whilst the 1979 version of Bram Stoker’s Dracula was filmed at Carlyon Bay. In 1988 several locations including Kynance Cove, Mount’s Bay and West Penwith were used for an adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Devil’s Foot."
