        "text": "Moby-Dick\n\nBy Herman Melville,\n\nFrom my list on to read on a cruise vacation.\n\nBy Sue Baic Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nSince spending much of my childhood on the Cornish coast, I’ve been fascinated by the ocean. Fortunately, I get to spend a lot of time at sea these days working as a cruise enrichment speaker! I’ve done 36 cruises so far aboard 15 different ships over the past 8 years. Much as I love visiting ports all around the world, I particularly enjoy a full day at sea with some time to relax and read in. I hope you enjoy your cruise and the books on this list as much as I have!\n\nSue's book list on to read on a cruise vacation\n\nWhy did Sue love this book?\n\nI could almost smell the sea and feel the spray on my face when I read this great American classic from 1851. I only discovered it recently when it was our book club choice and I’m wondering now why it took me so long!\n\nMelville draws on his experience working on a whaling ship and his writing is about the oceans is so descriptive. D. H. Lawrence called it \"\"the greatest book of the sea ever written\" and I’d agree. I loved the detailed and realistic accounts of whaling and life aboard ship.\n\nI also learned a lot from the exploration of class, social status, vengeance, and the meaning of good and evil. It’s a long read with a lot of detail, but I enjoyed the plot and found the ending totally gripping.\n\nBy Herman Melville,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n21 authors picked Moby-Dick as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMelville's tale of the whaling industry, and one captain's obsession with revenge against the Great White Whale that took his leg. Classics Illustrated tells this wonderful tale in colourful comic strip form, offering an excellent introduction for younger readers. This edition also includes a biography of Herman Melville and study questions, which can be used both in the classroom or at home to further engage the reader in the work at hand.\n\nPreview\n\nOn Writing\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nFrom my list on getting any writer started in the industry.\n\nBy James Phelps Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am passionate about this book list because it helped me get where I am today, a multiple-times bestselling author and an award-winning senior reporter. I began working as an overnight police round reporter before moving into sports, where I became one of Australia's best news-breaking rugby league journalists. I was then appointed News Corp Australia's Chief National Motorsports Writer and traveled the world chasing Formula 1 story, as well as covering Australia's V8 Supercar races. Everyone has to start somewhere, and for me, this list of books helped me begin and continue to grow to reach the level of success that I have.\n\nJames' book list on getting any writer started in the industry\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nIt’s 2005, and it’s my first day at The Daily Telegraph. I still couldn’t believe they had hired me as a cadet journalist. The smile I was wearing–from ear to ear–suddenly vanished when the Chief of Staff walked over and said, ‘Phelpsy, a bus has just crashed in Egypt. We have been told that there may have been some Australian tourists on board. Punch out 500 words and give it to me in an hour.’\n\nI turned to my computer screen, looked down at my keyboard, and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I was doing. I’d never had any writing training, and my experience was limited to the gibber I had been submitting to the paper (for free) for the past year in the hope of landing a job. After ten minutes of writing a word or two, deleting them, and then doing it again, I…\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n23 authors picked On Writing as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTwentieth Anniversary Edition with Contributions from Joe Hill and Owen King\n\nONE OF TIME MAGAZINE’S TOP 100 NONFICTION BOOKS OF ALL TIME\n\nImmensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King’s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.\n\n“Long live the King” hailed Entertainment Weekly upon publication of Stephen King’s On Writing.

Lauder Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a young adult fantasy author and paranoid survivalist. I have spent years curating items for my end-of-days go-bag, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than hanging out in universes that are about to go bang!\n\nC.L.'s book list on dystopian novels to make you cling to your duvet and worship your walls\n\nWhy did C.L. love this book?\n\nLegends are made of powerful stuff, and nothing has greater power than a total flip in perspective. I still recall the gut-punch end to this book, though it’s been decades since I read it.\n\nRobert Neville is a vampire hunter by day and a tormented man by night. As seemingly the only living human in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Robert faces depression, isolation, alcoholism, and his undead neighbor, Ben Cortman, who appears outside Robert’s front door each night chanting, \"Come out, Neville.\"\n\nBut when Robert is finally captured, and the truth of his situation is revealed, he gets a good look at the world through the eyes of the undead and is forced to ask himself, who am I? What have I become?\n\nBy Richard Matheson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked I Am Legend as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn acclaimed SF novel about vampires. The last man on earth is not alone ...Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth ...but he is not alone. Every other man, woman and child on the planet has become a vampire, and they are hungry for Neville's blood. By day he is the hunter, stalking the undead through the ruins of civilisation. By night, he barricades himself in his home and prays for the dawn. How long can one man survive like this?\n\nPreview\n\nFrankenstein\n\nBy Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,\n\nWhy did Randy love this book?\n\nPerhaps the most classic work of horror fiction in both literature and cinema. As an English teacher, I find that there is so much fodder for lessons prevalent in this book–nature vs nurture, the dangers of forbidden knowledge and playing God, the arrogance of science, and who the real monster is. I particularly love the difference between The Monster in the novel and the film, its articulation, desires, abilities, and even its physical appearance. Few written works have been more seminal.\n\nBy Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n43 authors picked Frankenstein as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOne of the BBC's '100 Novels That Shaped Our World'\n\n'That rare story to pass from literature into myth' The New York Times\n\nMary Shelley's chilling Gothic tale was conceived when she was only eighteen, living with her lover Percy Shelley on Lake Geneva. The story of Victor Frankenstein who, obsessed with creating life itself, plunders graveyards for the material to fashion a new being, but whose botched creature sets out to destroy his maker, would become the world's most famous work of horror fiction, and remains a devastating exploration of the limits of human creativity. Based on the third…\n\nPreview\n\nNight Film\n\nBy Marisha Pessl,\n\nFrom my list on sleuths who have enough problems without a mystery to solve.\n\nBy Kat Hausler Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love to see complicated characters rising to the occasion. People in real life generally have a lot going on just handling the day-to-day, and they aren’t waiting around for adventure, romance, or mystery to find them. It feels very human to me to see characters struggling with more mundane things like social situations, worrying about their appearance, or holding down a job, rather than only focusing on the plot arc, and that’s the type of character I also focus on as a writer. My latest protagonist, Simon, definitely has enough problems without a missing-person case to solve, so he may be what got me thinking of this topic.\n\nKat's book list on sleuths who have enough problems without a mystery to solve\n\nWhy did Kat love this book?\n\nSomething that really drew me into this book is how slippery the sense of danger is: Is journalist Scott McGrath only risking further legal trouble with Stanislas Cordova if he continues to research the suicide of the mysterious director’s daughter, or is he up against something far more evil?\n\nAfter his last encounter with Cordova destroyed his career, reputation, and marriage, Scott McGrath should be worrying about other things… but he can’t help himself. I was also intrigued by his shifting motivations: Is he driven by a need to know the truth, seeking revenge, fascinated by the story, or trying to protect himself and his loved ones?\n\nMany scenes felt like optical illusions where I could see entirely different truths depending on what perspective I looked at them from.\n\nBy Marisha Pessl,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Night Film as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY\n\nNPR • Cosmopolitan • Kirkus Reviews • BookPage\n\nA page-turning thriller for readers of Stephen King, Gillian Flynn, and Stieg Larsson, Night Film tells the haunting story of a journalist who becomes obsessed with the mysterious death of a troubled prodigy—the daughter of an iconic, reclusive filmmaker.\n\nOn a damp October night, beautiful young Ashley Cordova is found dead in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances…\n\nPreview\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nBy Charles Dickens,\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nYou cannot mention a coming-of-age novel without mentioning this classic.\n\nPip is an orphan who meets an escaped prisoner in a graveyard, does him a good deed, then is made a gentleman from an inheritance he knows nothing about. All of us enter our youth with great expectations and some of us are lucky enough, or unlucky, to meet our own beautiful Estella or the damaged and doomed Miss Havisham or the worldly and wise attorney Mister Jaggers.\n\nSet in London where the worlds of extreme poverty and privilege co-exist side by side, we experience this world firsthand as Pip does wondering, all the time, if we can survive it unscathed. Ignore all other movie adaptations since they will only disappoint. Screen the 1946 version directed by David Lean. It is a great film.\n\nBy Charles Dickens,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked Great Expectations as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'His novels will endure as long as the language itself' Peter Ackroyd\n\nDickens's haunting late novel depicts the education and development of a young man, Pip, as his life is changed by a series of events - a terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor - and he discovers the true nature of his 'great expectations'. This definitive edition includes appendices on Dickens's original ending, giving an illuminating glimpse into a…\n\nPreview\n\nLet the Right One in\n\nBy John Ajvide Lindqvist, Ebba Segerberg (translator),\n\nFrom my list on horror with child protagonists that are not for kids.\n\nBy Katie Marie Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nHorror is my passion and most things I read and everything I write fits neatly into the genre. But I am also passionate about telling stories from a unique perspective, or if not entirely unique then at least one that is underused. My novella A Man in Winter is told from the perspective of an elderly chap with dementia for instance. I have also found that many people think books with child protagonists must be children’s books and it makes me sad to think of all the wonderful work is being missed out on, I hope that my list has convinced you to try one of the above books.\n\nKatie's book list on horror with child protagonists that are not for kids\n\nWhy did Katie love this book?\n\nSo much of Lindqvists writing is fantastic, but this has to be my favorite. I read it while in university and then I re-read it and re-read it until one of my housemates asked why it was taking me so long to read a single book then seemed confused when I admitted that every time I finished it I just started it again.\n\nI love the take Lindqvist has on the vampire as a ‘monster’ Eli is complex and sympathetic, dangerous and vulnerable it’s a wonderful balancing act. But what I enjoyed most of all was that Eli, while being hundreds of years old, is physically and mentally, twelve. Their long life did not make them an adult in a child’s body, they literally stunted their growth and that makes them so compelling.\n\nBy John Ajvide Lindqvist, Ebba Segerberg (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked Let the Right One in as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJohn Ajvide Lindqvist’s international bestseller Let the Right One In is “a brilliant take on the vampire myth, and a roaring good story” (New York Times bestselling author Kelley Armstrong), the basis for the multi-film festival award-winning Swedish film, the U.S. adaptation Let Me In directed by Matt Reeves (The Batman), and the Showtime TV series.\n\nIt is autumn 1981 when inconceivable horror comes to Blackeberg, a suburb in Sweden. The body of a teenager is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at…\n\nPreview\n\nOutlander\n\nBy Diana Gabaldon,\n\nFrom my list on thriller/suspense escapism with strong female protagonists, full of grit, sass, and humour.\n\nBy Teresa M. Schulz Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have always had a wicked imagination and loved to tell stories. Unfortunately, this had me naively believing in fairy tales and happy endings. Cinderella has a lot to answer for. My kind heart and trusting nature were a magnet for bad men, and boy, did I suffer because of it. The term “Viking Berserker” comes to mind. This is why I have a passion for reading about strong women. I’ve learned (through reading books – such as those on my recommended list) that to survive, you have to have hope for a better future, and inspiring people – within inspiring stories – can often give you that hope.\n\nTeresa's book list on thriller/suspense escapism with strong female protagonists, full of grit, sass, and humour\n\nWhy did Teresa love this book?\n\nThe Author’s style is totally immersive. It begins with time travel through standing stones, and the genres multiply from there. The story has a good pace, plenty of action and adventure, humour, and a hunky scotsman… what else could you ask for?\n\nIn all seriousness, the main character is a feisty WW2 nurse who, when challenged, is ready to voice her opinions with plenty of sass. She is also strong, skilled, kind-hearted, and downright funny at times. She reminds me a lot of myself.\n\nBy Diana Gabaldon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n33 authors picked Outlander as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The first book in Diana Gabaldon’s acclaimed Outlander saga, the basis for the Starz original series.\n\nOne of the top ten best-loved novels in America, as seen on PBS’s The Great American Read!\n\nUnrivaled storytelling.

Her New York Times bestselling Outlander novels have earned the praise of critics and captured the hearts of millions of fans. Here is the story that started it all, introducing two remarkable characters, Claire Beauchamp Randall and Jamie Fraser, in a spellbinding novel of passion and…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\n\nBy Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss (translator),\n\nFrom my list on books to read when living on a small island.\n\nBy Tristan Nettles Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up reading, mostly due to a speech impediment that left me awkward and shy. I was lucky enough to experience world travel at a young age. My parents' divorce set me on a different path. Five middle schools and seven high schools later, I volunteered as a Marine Corps infantryman. I left the USA in 2015 to travel the world, from Micronesia to Nepal to Honduras and even Ukraine, where I fought with the Ukrainian Foreign Legion.\n\nTristan's book list on books to read when living on a small island\n\nWhy did Tristan love this book?\n\nThis is the single greatest work of fiction ever written, reaching heights close to perfection. A life-changing read with utterly fascinating plots and caricatures that swallows hours with joyous ease.\n\nThis book is the book I set all other books against as the ultimate judge to decide its ultimate rating, thus making the Count of Monte Cristo the perfect ten.\n\nBy Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n13 authors picked The Count of Monte Cristo as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe epic tale of wrongful imprisonment, adventure and revenge, in its definitive translation\n\nThrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of If.

Dumas' epic tale of suffering and retribution, inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment, was a huge popular success when it was first serialized…\n\nPreview\n\nTess of the D Urbervilles\n\nBy Thomas Hardy,\n\nWhy did Joy love this book?\n\nTess of the D'Urbervilles has the dual quality of a being great work of literature, and a polemic which faces the issues of poverty and oppression—an incredibly honest, balanced portrayal of all aspects of rural life. Many of my personal problems reflected the traumas faced by the tragic heroine.\n\nBy Thomas Hardy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Tess of the D Urbervilles as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHarperCollins is pround to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.\n\n'My life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances! When I see what you know, what you have read, and seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am!'\n\nChallenging the hypocrisy and social conventions of the rural Victorian world, Tess of the D'Urbervilles follows the story of Tess Durbeyfield as she attempts to escape the poverty of her background, seeking wealth by claiming connection with the aristocratic D'Urberville family. It is through Tess's relationships with two very different men that Hardy tells…\n\nPreview"
