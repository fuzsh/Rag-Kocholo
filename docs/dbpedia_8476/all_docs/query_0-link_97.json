        "text": "A LEADING campaign group has demanded British tourists boycott hotels and resorts that deny Jamaicans access to beaches across the island.\n\nThis comes after two of Bob Marley’s children, Ziggy and Cedella Marley backed Jamaica Beach Birthright Environmental Movement’s (JABBEM) drive, calling for all of Jamaica’s beaches to be made accessible to local people.\n\nJABBEM was launched following reports that some local Jamaicans were being turned away from beaches in the Caribbean country.\n\nThe group’s president, Dr Devon Taylor, is a Biomedical Research Scientist and an environmental and social justice advocate and says he is thankful to Ziggy for using his voice to amplify the issue.\n\nHe told The Voice he would like to see similar actions that Jamaicans took against Apartheid in South Africa in the 80s and 90s, now taken concerning the issue of beach access.\n\nHe said: “A lot of music was made, we did a lot of protests and we let our voices be heard.\n\n“I think it is time, that when you vacation in Jamaica you ask your resort ‘can a Jamaican walk over your property to get to the beach?’ and if they say ‘no’ then you say ‘well I can’t stay here.’”\n\nDr Taylor wants tourists to “take action” and “put their money where their mouth is” and tell hotels and resorts they won’t be booking holidays with them, if Jamaicans are denied access to the beach.\n\nHe also said travellers should exercise their “economic power” to create the change they want to see, as they have alternatives with the growing number of quality Airbnb’s available across the island.\n\n“Jamaica’s economic model basically says that Jamaicans and tourists cannot coexist on the same beach,” he explained.\n\nHe continued: “Every hotel that comes, adopts that same model.”\n\nDr Taylor, who is from Steer Town, in the parish of St Ann, said he has witnessed first-hand parts of the North Coast of Jamaica lose all access to its beaches.\n\nHe said: “Growing up we had access to several beaches along that corridor we’re are just a mile and half outside of Ocho Rios.\n\n“What we have witnessed over a period of twenty years is we have lost all access.\n\n“So communities in Steer Town and Mammee Bay South have no access to the sea, it has all been closed off by the development and commercialisation of the coast by hotels, villas and private residence”\n\nHe added: “They have completely barricaded the community, so Steer Town is landlocked!”\n\nHe said: “Seeing my community impacted, we had to do something.”\n\nAccording to the president of JABBEM, the campaign is gathering pace and is being supported by other parishes like Portland, St Mary and St Thomas.\n\nDr Taylor claims there are two cases in the courts in Jamaica, to retain access to the beaches and to also protect access to a popular beach.\n\nThe social and environmental justice advocate said that placing a limitation on the amount of beach front land foreign investors can purchase should be something the government considers.\n\nHe said: “The limitation should be a partnership with Jamaicans and you cannot own more than 50 per cent, so you will be on 49 per cent and 51 per cent stays in the hand of a Jamaican.”\n\nDr Taylor applauded Brits of Jamaican heritage who have a desire to invest in their home country and said the process of purchasing land needs to be more “transparent to the diaspora” so investment can be a reality.\n\nHe said: “Coastal land tends to change hands into the same socio-economic class in Jamaica and the ones that the government has they are not selling it to Jamaicans.”\n\n“Our government has not targeted the Jamaican diaspora as investment partners,” he said.\n\nSinnéad Jackson, 20, is from New Cross, southeast London, and is of Jamaican descent and has a lifelong dream to purchase land ‘back home’ but doesn’t know where to start.\n\nSpeaking to The Voice, she said: “My dad has property out there that he wants to leave to his children who are born here but we know nothing at all about how it works out there.\n\n“Even if we wanted to buy another property or sell it we got no idea how to do that.”\n\nMs Jackson’s mother has a property on the island and says she has to contact her father in Jamaica who understands how the system works and he has told her “you are getting ripped off and are paying too much Land Tax.”\n\nThe Freelance Journalist says the Jamaica High Commission should be doing more to inform Brits with Jamaican roots how to acquire land.\n\n“A lot of us want somewhere to stay that is not touristy and we want our own place, but we don’t even know how to acquire one,” she said.\n\nThe 20-year-old said if she knew the right steps of how to buy land in Jamaica it would be something that she would “definitely” do.\n\nShe added: “If it was easier and clearer how to purchase property it would be a lot more popular amongst us who are British but have Caribbean heritage.”\n\nMs Jackson said Jamaicans who live on the island should be given priority to purchase land in the country and then those in diaspora.\n\nShe said: “There should definitely be restrictions on how much people from overseas can buy.\n\n“Otherwise they are going to continue to buy up all the beaches and all the land and before you know it, locals won’t be able to go and enjoy the beauty of the country.”\n\nDr Taylor also believes coastal land should be protected and kept in a trust for Jamaican people and not sold.\n\nHe added: “We are witnessing one of the greatest transfers of wealth of the country into the hands of private companies and that is almost criminal because you will find one day the country is landlocked and you cannot buy it back because its multinationals that control it and they will ask for a lot of money for it.\n\n“You will find one day the country is landlocked and you cannot buy it back!”\n\nJABBEM’s campaign and advocacy was created to challenge the Beach Control Act 1956, which Dr Taylor says is a “colonial era legislation” which “ does not give Jamaicans any right to walk along the beaches no right to swim or really access it.”\n\n“It is written in law and that law has been sitting there for the last 67 years and no government at all has made any amendments to make that wrong become a right,” he said.\n\nHe added: “We must rid our emerging constitution of all discriminatory laws that were colonial hand overs that still impact the psychological state of Jamaica.”\n\nDr Taylor says any hopes of removing the legislation will require court action.\n\nIn the coming months, he says a legal defence fund will be set up and he is encouraging the Jamaican diaspora in the UK, to help contribute to the fund and use their voices to call for “constitutional protection for beach access.”\n\nHe also urged the global Jamaican and Caribbean community to sign the online petition to protect beach access for Jamaicans.\n\nHe says his campaign is clear, and he wants “general and unfettered” rights of access to all beaches in Jamaica and for that to be constitutionally protected.\n\nHe said now is the time for Jamaicans to have general rights of access which means “non-conditional” or that “no permission is required.”\n\nDr Taylor is also a senior research and drug discovery scientist in Immunology and says since Jamaica’s Emancipation in 1838, there has not been any serious land reform, meaning, most of the descendants of enslaved Africans have “experienced being landless and homeless” as a result of colonialism.\n\nHe says as Jamaica moves towards becoming a republic, “internal reparations” of land rights for Jamaicans must also put on the table to ensure the people can benefit from “development, wealth, power and independence” that comes with being a landowner.\n\nDr Taylor said the beach access issue will also have a detrimental impact on Jamaica’s natural resources and environment.\n\nHe said: “The removal of all the forestry that exists on the coastline, which is a living ecosystem, has consequences on the biodiversity on the coast.\n\n“It’s bad environmental policy to commercialise so much acreage on the coastline that is going to have climate change consequences and that is going to be a bill that the country is going to have to deal with.”\n\nJamaica is the third-largest Caribbean island, with a total land area of just under 11,000 square kilometers.\n\nAccording to the Jamaica Information Service, the government is the largest owner of land in Jamaica, with the majority of the land assets vested in the Commissioner of Lands."
