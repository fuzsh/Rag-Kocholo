        "text": "I have always loved hotels. And it’s no surprise I want to read books set in hotels because one of the things I missed in this pandemic is staying in a hotel. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not a big spender, but I make sure I stay in a nice hotel when I’m travelling (which is not very often, so it is a treat). I truly believe it may be my only luxury. And I hope reading books set in hotels will offer me some kind of comfort over these times.\n\nI tried to include books set in hotels from many genres, but these are primarily historical fiction or literary fiction. I’m always on the lookout for translated fiction, so you’ll find authors from around the world and so books set in hotels around the world. I can never read horror stories, so cult a book like Stephen King’s The Shining is not on the list. I also didn’t include A Room With a View and Jamaica Inn because they are hugely popular choices among books set in hotels.\n\nThere is something strange and magical about hotels. It may be the previous guests’ lingering energies or the stories the rooms have kept for all those years. Whatever it is, whenever I stay in a hotel (luxury or shabby), I feel excited and happy. And reading books set in hotels are not that different. I hope you’ll find a book to your taste and enjoy it a lot. I know the theme books set in hotels may not be for everyone, but I realised that books set in hotels are actually wonderful stories, and you may enjoy them more than you think.\n\n15 Beautiful Books Set In Hotels\n\nCheck out my other lists about books!\n\n10 Uplifting Books\n\nGreat Novels by Poets\n\nFeel-Good Cozy Mystery Series\n\nSummer Books – 20 Sexy Novels\n\nAutumn Books – 20 Cozy Novels\n\nWinter Books- 20 Atmospheric Novels\n\nSpring Books – 20 Lovely Novels\n\n20 Captivating Gothic Books\n\nJapanese Books Under 200 Pages\n\n20 Best Campus and Academic Novels\n\n25 Intriguing Dark Academia Books\n\n20 Literary Romance Novels\n\n20 Best Food Culture and Food History Books\n\nComforting Food Memoirs\n\nTop 5 Haiku Books\n\n15 Best Eco-fiction Novels\n\nPerfect Christmas Books\n\n20 Best Turkish Books\n\nStandalone Fantasy Books\n\nFantasy Book Series\n\nNovels Based on Mythology and Legends\n\nTarot Books to Learn From\n\nBooks About Astrology\n\nBooks About Esotericism\n\nBooks for Book Clubs\n\nMagical Realism Books\n\nMindfulness Books\n\nCaptivating Reincarnation Books\n\nRemarkable Break-Up Novels\n\nBooks for Travel Lovers\n\nBrilliant Mythology Books\n\nEgyptian Mythology Books\n\nTrain Journey Books\n\nBooks Set in Museums\n\nBooks Set in Hotels\n\nBooks Set on Islands\n\nBooks Set in Forests\n\nNovels Set in Ancient Egypt\n\nNovels Set in Bookshops\n\nNovels Set in Libraries\n\nBooks Set in the English Countryside\n\nBooks Set in Edinburgh\n\nBooks Set in Oxford\n\nBooks Set in Istanbul\n\nBooks Set in Rome\n\nBooks Set in Portugal\n\nBooks Set in Egypt\n\nBooks Set in Greece\n\nBooks Set in Mexico\n\nBooks Set in South Africa\n\nBooks Set in New York\n\nBooks Set in Paris\n\nBooks Set in Barcelona\n\nBooks Set in Berlin\n\nNovels Set in China\n\nBooks Set in Tokyo\n\nBooks Set in Bali\n\nNovels Under 100 Pages\n\nNovels Under 150 Pages\n\nNovels Under 200 Pages\n\nNovels About Older Woman, Younger Man Relationships\n\nNovels About Fortune Telling\n\nNovels About Translators and Interpreters\n\nNovels About Books\n\nBest Books About Books\n\nNovels About Vincent Van Gogh\n\nNovels About Leonardo da Vinci\n\nBooks About Picasso\n\nNovels About Marriage\n\nNovels About Food\n\nNovels About Writers\n\nNovels About Music\n\nBooks About Witches\n\nBooks About Divorce\n\nNovels About Ernest Hemingway\n\nBest Books About Birds\n\nBest Books About Walking\n\nBest Books About Tea\n\nBooks on Social Issues and Identity\n\nNovels About Scents & Perfume\n\nExciting Thriller Novels of All Time\n\nBooks on Art and Creativity\n\nMind-Expanding Philosophy Books\n\nHistorical Fiction Novels\n\nBeautiful Poetry Collections\n\nPowerful Books About Peace\n\nBeautiful Romance Novels\n\nAre there any books set in hotels that you’d like to add to this list?
