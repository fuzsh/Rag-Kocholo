I have always loved hotels. And it’s no surprise I want to read books set in hotels because one of the things I missed in this pandemic is staying in a hotel. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not a big spender, but I make sure I stay in a nice hotel when I’m travelling (which is not very often, so it is a treat). I truly believe it may be my only luxury. And I hope reading books set in hotels will offer me some kind of comfort over these times.

I tried to include books set in hotels from many genres, but these are primarily historical fiction or literary fiction. I’m always on the lookout for translated fiction, so you’ll find authors from around the world and so books set in hotels around the world. I can never read horror stories, so cult a book like Stephen King’s The Shining is not on the list. I also didn’t include A Room With a View and Jamaica Inn because they are hugely popular choices among books set in hotels.

There is something strange and magical about hotels. It may be the previous guests’ lingering energies or the stories the rooms have kept for all those years. Whatever it is, whenever I stay in a hotel (luxury or shabby), I feel excited and happy. And reading books set in hotels are not that different. I hope you’ll find a book to your taste and enjoy it a lot. I know the theme books set in hotels may not be for everyone, but I realised that books set in hotels are actually wonderful stories, and you may enjoy them more than you think.
