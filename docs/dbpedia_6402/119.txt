We Dive At Dawn tells the story of the British submarine crew of the Sea Tiger who are on a mission to sink the German battleship Brandenburg. The movie is a depiction of the bravery, camaraderie, and sacrifice of the submariners who risked their lives for their country.

The movie begins with the Sea Tiger crew being assembled for their mission. As they are about to leave the dock, one of the crew members is arrested for being drunk, but the captain decides to take him along. The submarine then sets off on its dangerous mission, facing multiple obstacles and dangers along the way, including enemy warships, aircraft, and mines.

As the Sea Tiger nears the target, they encounter a German destroyer and are forced to dive. Despite the danger of depth charges, the crew manages to evade the destroyer and continues with their mission. However, as they approach the Brandenburg, they discover that it is not alone and that there is another battleship, the Karlsruhe, nearby. The Sea Tiger has to navigate the perilous waters and the enemy ships to get to their target.

Throughout the mission, the crew shows courage, quick-thinking, and unity. The tension of the mission is heightened by the claustrophobic, cramped conditions of the submarine, and the constant threat of danger. The crew is tested several times as the mission takes an unexpected turn, and they have to improvise to fulfill their objective.

Despite the odds stacked against them, the Sea Tiger crew shows determination to complete their mission. They are willing to risk it all for their country, and their bond strengthens as they work together to achieve their goal.

The film also touches on the moral implications of war, as the crew grapples with the consequences of their mission. Captain Taylor, played by Mills, is conflicted with the idea of killing hundreds of German sailors, even if it's in the pursuit of victory. The film presents a nuanced approach to the morality of war, depicting the human cost of conflict.
