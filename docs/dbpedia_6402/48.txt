Review by anonymous (posted on 8-Jun-2006)

Most WWII submarine movies were done in Hollywood after the war. This one was made during the war in Britain. The differences are telling. Although entirely a fictional account, the story told is one of the better of the genre. The British sub is sent on a near suicide mission to sink a large German battleship. This is pretty good stuff here. The movie has some of the same claustiphobic feeling of Das Boot. The side plots concerning the crew's lives on shore are well told. The action sequences are done in typical stiff-upper lipped British style, which in this case, works very well. Little gloss here. Little gloss needed. (Do you hear that, Hollywood?) Altogether, this is good story telling. I consider it to be one of the better WW II sub movies, easily competing with movies like "Run Silent, Run Deep" which is near the top of my list.
