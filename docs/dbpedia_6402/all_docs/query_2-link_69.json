        "text": "On this day in history 05/03/24. In 1970 the world premiere of The Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúLet it Be‚Äù documentary film directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, takes place in New York City. Let It Be is a 1970 British documentary film starring the Beatles and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. The film documents the group‚Äôs rehearsing and recording songs in January 1969 for what was to become their twelfth and final studio album Let It Be. The film includes an unannounced rooftop concert by the group, the last public performance of the four together. The film was originally planned as a television documentary that would accompany a concert broadcast. When plans for the concert broadcast were dropped, the project became a feature film production. Although the film does not dwell on the dissension within the group at the time, it provides some glimpses into the dynamics that would lead to their break-up. The Beatles won an Oscar for Let It Be in the category ‚ÄúOriginal Song Score‚Äù, which Quincy Jones accepted on their behalf. The soundtrack also won a Grammy for ‚ÄúBest Original Score‚Äù. Only Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were named as recipients by the Recording Academy due to the belief that they were the sole composers. They mistakenly overlooked Starr‚Äôs writing credit on the song ‚ÄúDig It‚Äù. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of 12 critics‚Äô reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating ‚Äúgenerally favorable reviews‚Äù. Now you know.

Directed by the legendary D. W. Griffith in 1913, this short drama film delves into the complexities of the human spirit, masterfully capturing the essence of motherhood and the inexorable strength found within it. Though over a century old, the film's narrative remains timeless, evoking a profound sense of empathy and connection. Preserved in the hallowed halls of the Museum of Modern Art's film archive, this cinematic treasure continues to inspire and move audiences. Its preservation is not merely about maintaining a piece of film history but about keeping alive the emotional depth and artistic beauty that it represents. The film serves as a poignant reminder of the silent era's ability to convey powerful stories through gesture, expression, and the pure visual storytelling that forms the bedrock of cinema as we know it today. The existence of \"The Mothering Heart\" in the modern era is a blessing, providing contemporary viewers a window into the past where every frame is a canvas and every movement a brushstroke of human experience. To watch it is to be reminded of our shared humanity, the struggles and joys of life, and the universal bond of motherhood that knows no bounds of time. It's a deeply emotional experience, encapsulating the grace and resilience of the human heart.\n\nA good book, providing a comprehensive history and assessment of the U.S. film industry in the 1950s. The author, noted film historian Foster Hirsch, brings his passion for movies to this lengthy but informative and holistic topical history. A wide spectrum is covered, to include a history of the major film studios, detailed information on the many technological developments, overviews of the famous movie stars, both newcomers and veterans, as well as a detailed assessment of the red scare and its affect on Hollywood. The only major topic not getting its own unique section in the book was the industry‚Äôs interaction with television. However, this history was integrated into many other components of the book, so the information is there, though distributed. I especially appreciated how Hirsch uses particular movies to highlight certain themes (artistic, business, cultural, technological, etc.) through a synopsis of the movie and the personal history of the people who created, made, acted in, or otherwise worked on it. A great book for understanding the dynamics of a major American cultural edifice of the 1950s.\n\nEl Film Production Presents In the turbulent aftermath of Castro‚Äôs revolution in Havana, two skilled spies, Isabel and Jorge, are tasked with infiltrating the United States by posing as a typical American family. Their mission: to raise Raul Castro's nephew, Alex, as their own child, integrate him into U.S. society, and prepare him for a future role in manipulating American politics from within. As their carefully constructed facade begins to fray, they must navigate the dangerous waters of espionage and family loyalty, all while facing mounting threats and unexpected challenges.\" Disclaimer: This story is a work of fiction. While it incorporates real historical figures and locations, including Fidel Castro and images of Cuba, the narrative, characters, and events are fictionalized. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, or actual events is coincidental. The depiction of espionage and related activities is purely imaginative and does not reflect actual historical events or real-life operations. The use of real locations and figures is intended to provide a backdrop for the fictional story and should not be interpreted as an accurate representation of historical facts.\n\nAnd, as both Maurice Blanchot and Samuel Beckett have taught us, waiting is the very condition of thinking, of questioning ‚Äî and as one is attending to the work of Wesley Leon Aroozoo (which is always a film, regardless of what it first appears to be), if one is paying attention, the question of what exactly are attending to is never far from one. Of whether the film is a documentary of Mr Aroozoo‚Äôs trip to Japan; a testimony to Yasuo Takamatsu and his undying fidelity to his wife; an indictment of neo-liberal Japan‚Äôs indifference to the loss of life; of the tsunami as a figure that opens socio-economic questions in the polis that we call Japan; and so on and so forth. And whilst the fact that multiple forms, a variety of questions, within a film is certainly not new, what stands out is Mr Aroozoo‚Äôs sensitivity to the singularity of each of these forms. Such that he is willing to respond ‚Äî responsibility and ethics being never far from his work, his approach ‚Äî to each of these possibilities without attempting to reconcile them, pull them under a totalitarian gesture of the author. Which means that Wesley Leon Aroozoo is not attempting auteur cinema ‚Äî but something even more interesting. Where, what he is doing is calling into question the very possibility of the author herself. Where his work, his film, is nothing more ‚Äî and infinitely nothing less ‚Äî than cinema as such https://lnkd.in/gSGCb9ss\n\nOscar 2024: Get to Know the Films Nominated for the Main Prize Presentation: As the expectation works for the impending Oscar 2024 service, film lovers all over the planet are anxious to investigate the artistic magnum opuses that have gotten selections for the lofty principal prize.

Most current films, through the bloody drift of their content, the weakness of their plots and their technological trumpery ‚Äì useless high-tech ‚Äì reveal an extraordinary contempt on the part of film-makers for the tools of their own trade, for their own profession: a supreme contempt for the image itself, which is prostituted to any special effect whatsoever; and, consequently, contempt for the viewer, who is called upon to figure as impotent voyeur of this prostitution of images, of this promiscuity of all forms beneath the alibi of violence. ‚ñ™Ô∏è There is in fact no real violence in this, nothing of a theatre of cruelty, but merely a second-level irony, the knowing wink of quotation, which no longer has anything to do with cinematic culture, but derives from the resentment that culture feels towards itself, that culture which precisely cannot manage to come to an end and is becoming infinitely debased - a debasement being raised to the power of an aesthetic and spiritual commodity, bitter and obsolescent, which we consume as a 'work of art' with the same complicity with which we savour the debasement of the political class. The sabotaging of the image by the image professionals is akin to the sabotaging of the political by the politicians themselves.‚Äù ‚Äï Jean Baudrillard, Fragments #baudrillardnow #jeanbaudrillard #fragments #cinema\n\nWhen it comes to the world of cinema, few names are as revered as Martin Scorsese. üìΩÔ∏è This legendary director, who finally clinched the Best Director award for \"The Departed,\" has been a consistent nominee throughout his illustrious career. But is this recognition truly indicative of his best work? Let's dive into Scorsese's cinematic journey. üéûÔ∏è From the raw intensity of \"Raging Bull\" to the spiritual exploration in \"The Last Temptation of the Christ,\" Scorsese's films have always pushed boundaries and challenged audiences. His work on \"Goodfellas\" is often hailed as one of the best adapted screenplays, showcasing his versatility behind the lens. Even in the 2000s, Scorsese continued to shine, with nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for films as diverse as \"Hugo\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" But let's not forget his recent work on \"The Irishman\" in 2020, which once again put him in the spotlight. üçø So, while \"The Departed\" may have won him the coveted Best Director award, it's clear that Scorsese's true genius lies in his consistent ability to captivate audiences with his storytelling prowess, regardless of the genre or era of his films. In the end, isn't that the true measure of a great director? Repost this if you enjoyed gaining insight into Scorsese's journey and recognition in the film industry. #ScorseseBestDirector #AcademyAwardsRecognition #ClassicCinemaDiscussion"
