        "text": "It’s finally here!!!! My first children’s book — reading age 7-12 years.\n\nFrom the publisher’s site:\n\nA finely-told, full-color illustrated book about childhood cancer\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO FLY WITH A GARGOYLE?\n\nToby didn’t ask to move halfway around the world to the Czech Republic with his mom and step-mom. He certainly didn’t ask to get sick.\n\nBut now, at the start of fifth grade, Toby finds himself being treated for cancer in a hospital far from his friends and familiar surroundings. He starts feeling trapped until a strange creature offers him an escape.\n\nA feline-shaped gargoyle has come to life! All Toby has to do is step through the window.\n\nFollow Toby on his night of adventure as he flies over enchanting Prague with his gargoyle guide, and learns he’s not alone at all.\n\nWritten by author Sherri Cook Woosley, and illustrated by artist Elena Moroz, Postcards from a City of Monsters is part of Improbable Press’ “Postcards” series, an imaginative fantasy set talking about issues important to kids, and which includes Postcards from a Lake Monster, a book about autism.\n\nBook publishes – and sale ends – August 29, 2024\n\nThere’s a sale right now — 20% off on pre-orders until AUGUST 29th. ORDER HERE.\n\nLet me know if you order a copy so I can personally thank you. I appreciate all the support for this topic which is very close to my heart.\n\nLove,\n\nSherri\n\nHey! I hope you are enjoying the pool, eating ice cream from a local dairy, and reading some intriguing books. I recently read The Pilgrim (thriller) by Terry Hayes and I’m about halfway through Godkiller (fantasy) by Hannah Kaner. I post my progress on both Goodreads and Storygraph like I’m a hunter and the books are my prey.\n\nMid-July and I’ve recovered enough optimism to start planning again! I’m excited to share that Mother’s Instinct will be released August 21st by e-Spec books and Postcards from a City of Monsters will be released August 29th by Improbable Press. Mother’s Instinct was fun to write because it was a What If? novel. Many people know that my Master’s Capstone centered on the role of women in medieval Irish and Welsh mythology. Okay, so what if I’d stayed in academia? What if I got to pursue sightings of an actual creature still haunting a remote Irish island? What if I took my daughter with me and she developed a connection with this deadly cryptid?\n\nPostcards has been a long time coming. If you’ve followed me then you know I first started posting over two years ago. The publisher nominated this story for a Pushcart prize (yaayyyy!!) back when it was included in the anthology Dark Cheer: Cryptids Emerging and it represents an important part of my life….when my daughter’s cancer treatment affected everything. So this story draws on both my experience of living in Prague (I went there to be an English teacher when I was 19 years old) and being a mother of a child with cancer. But the story is about a boy who wants to escape the hospital and the gargoyle who helps him. The illustrations by Elena Moroz are fabulous. Simply breathtaking in the way she captured what was in my imagination.\n\nEach publisher chose the date so it is a coincidence that they are releasing only a week apart. For Postcards, the publisher is timing the release to coincide with Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month. This is also right as I’m starting a new school year… so I’m trying to promote the books now. What does that mean? Well, pre-orders are WONDERFUL THINGS. Preorder Here If you purchase a copy of Mother’s Instinct NOW then it pushes my book higher on the release day so that more people see it. If more people see it, then more may buy it. If more people buy it then my publisher is happy. If my publisher is happy then they may invite me to write another project for them. Then, and only then, do I get to be happy.\n\nI’ll post again when Improbable Press has their preorder page up — should be at the end of July.\n\nIn the meantime, I’ve also put together my schedule of appearances for the rest of 2024:\n\nFri. July 26th/Sun. July 28th Shore Leave 44 Lancaster, PA\n\nSat. September 15th Bel Air Festival of the Arts Bel Air, MD\n\nSat/Sun September 28-29 FrightReads Millersville, MD\n\nSat., November 2nd Authors & Artists Bel Air, MD\n\nSun. November 17th Books and Brews Market Street Brewery Havre de Grace, MD\n\nNov 21-24 National Council of Teachers of English Boston, MA\n\nFinally, I sold another story to Abyss & Apex and that story about kelpies will be coming out online on January 1st, 2025.\n\nFor fun: a throwback to the summer that I taught Goat Yoga.\n\nLove,\n\nSherri\n\nI had a fantastic weekend at Balticon in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore (this is exactly what gets burned down in my book Walking Through Fire, by the way). It was nice to see people again, to snack on cannolis in Little Italy and enjoy a paleta, a Mexican frozen treat made from strawberries and then dipped in chocolate.\n\nMy panels (and fellow panelists) were fun and we had spirited discussions.\n\nI moderated: Keeping Your Anitheroes Likable\n\nI moderated: What Should I Read Next\n\nI was a panelist for: Magic in the Ancient Mediterranean\n\nI was a panelist for: Gods as Characters\n\nI also had a reading and chose to read from “Swan Dive” in Musings of the Muses and then the first chapter of my upcoming novel, Ashes of Regret.\n\nOne note about reading the first chapter. I asked certain of my high school students to critique the content and I was pleased as an author to receive the feedback about what was confusing or what could be changed, but as a teacher I couldn’t have been more proud. Seriously, I’m amazed by my students and the skill and energy they bring to working with language and determining the elements of a story.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is the cover for Ashes of Regret. I will launch the novel at Shore Leave this July.\n\nLove,\n\nSherri\n\nI love this time of year! Friends, family, and food are the heart of the holiday and I appreciate the emphasis on gratitude and the opportunity for me to grow by choosing to focus on the good and not the setbacks. For example, this year has been the year of anthologies for me. I have short stories in: Black-Eyed Peas on New Year’s Day, Thrilling Adventure Yarns 2021, Once Upon a Dystopia, Dark Cheer: Cryptids Emerging, AND an acceptance for an anthology forthcoming in Spring, 2022.\n\nCheck out this beautiful cover!\n\nMy short story “Gargoyles of Prague” is being included in the anthology DARK CHEER: CRYPTIDS EMERGING Volume Blue. The story is based on my experience of being a mother of a child with a life-threatening illness and the year I spent teaching English in Prague, Czech Republic. It will be released in early December by Improbable Press. Please enjoy this excerpt:\n\nWhen the hospital door closed behind his mothers, Toby stepped closer to the window. In the gloam, the urban landscape had morphed from buildings into mysterious shapes. Grit – rock against brick – scraped outside his seventh story window. Curious, Toby leaned his forehead against the cold glass to see better. No locks on windows this high; only solid panes.\n\nSuddenly gray claws came into view and dug into the brick wall to find purchase. Wings the same shade smacked against the window. Then a gray face, chiseled, filled the window. A feline face with carved nose, eyes, and whiskers. Wings pressed tightly to its back. Sharp teeth and a tongue that hung out in mid-pant. A statue. One of the creatures that decorated so many of Prague’s ancient buildings.\n\n“Come out,” the gargoyle said. The voice sounded like it looked: coarse and solid.\n\nToby’s hands trembled. “I don’t know how.”\n\n“Yes, you do.”\n\nMore good news! Improbable Press has chosen to turn my short story into an illustrated children’s book! I will share details soon, but I’ve seen the artist’s portfolio and I can’t wait to see what she does with Toby and my gargoyle and the incredible Charles Bridge.\n\nAND…I have another story acceptance for an anthology centered on Greek mythology and history.\n\nFor those who have stuck with me after reading my novel Walking Through Fire, I have the rights back from the publisher and I sent off the draft of ASHES OF REGRET (Book 1.5 that features Tamaki) for a final editorial readthrough. I’m also working with a graphic designer for the cover and a map!\n\nFinally, I had the opportunity to be a guest on MOUTHFUL OF GRAFFITTI, a podcast for musicians and authors hosted by Brad Cox. Take a listen here as I talk about our pandemic chickens, local festivals, and more about the inspiration for “Garygoyles of Prague.”\n\nI have a lot of plans for 2022 in the works and I can’t wait to share them with you as we get closer.\n\nEnjoy the holiday and enjoy a good book!\n\nLove,\n\nSherri\n\nThe Baltimore Science Fiction Society will hold Balticon 55 as a free virtual convention Memorial Day weekend, May 28-31, 2021. The guest of honor is Seanan MacGuire. Seanan was the winner of the 2010 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, and her novel Feed (as Mira Grant) was named as one of Publishers Weekly’s Best Books of 2010. In 2013 she became the first person ever to appear five times on the same Hugo Ballot. To prepare for the con, I’m currently reading her novel MIDDLEGAME.\n\nI’ve had the honor of participating in this convention for several years. This year I will be a moderator, a reader, and a panelist. I’m incredibly excited about my panel topics. Check out my schedule:\n\nFriday, May 28th\n\n2:30 PM Traditional Storytelling and Genre Fiction\n\nWhy am I a panelist: My Master’s Thesis was on the role of women in medieval Irish and Welsh texts. The myths began as oral stories and I’ve been trained to recognize techniques in the books that are a result of that origin\n\n4:30 PM Reading: Sherri Cook Woosley\n\nShould I read from an upcoming novel in my Misbegotten series or should I read from a short story?\n\nSunday, May 30th\n\n11:30 AM Tell Me What to Read Next (Moderator)\n\nWhy am I a moderator? As part of the Charm City Spec reading series, I have a familiarity with contemporary speculative fiction. I hope everyone leaves our discussion with a huge To-Be-Read list!\n\n2:30 PM The Motivations of Monsters\n\nWhy am I a panelist? I love the idea of discussing how monsters have evolved in fiction to represent fears of each generation. My background in world mythology and fairy tales will help to be specific about monsters from various time periods and various cultures.\n\n7:00 PM Writing Compelling Villains\n\nWhy am I a panelist? This is a time ripe for writing anti-heroes and villains because of the rage against what is happening in our society. From Holly Black’s The Cruel Prince series to Sarah J. Maas’s A Court of Thorn and Roses series to Baru Comorant, we have characters making devastating — and horrible — choices for the greater good. Does the end justify the means or is that just something that villains say?\n\nI hope to “see” you at Balticon this weekend!\n\nLove,\n\nSherri\n\nGIVEAWAY There are two ways to win.\n\nComment on this blog or sign up for my author newsletter here and you’ll be automatically entered into the drawing for a copy of THRILLING ADVENTURE YARNS 2.\n\nBONUS: The first person to figure out the discrepancy between the release picture and my Western story will win a copy of Thrilling Adventure Yarns 2021 AND a $25 Amazon gift certificate. Email taste of sherri @ gmail. com (no spaces) with answer. Ann Hanlin won this part of the contest. The story is a Western, but I had an ENGLISH saddle in the picture.\n\n*The GIVEAWAY lasts until midnight (EST) Sunday, April 25th. US only.\n\nI’m very excited to interview my friend Kelli Fitzpatrick! We roomed together at Taos Toolbox, a two-week writing workshop, in 2018 and have been friends ever since.\n\nSherri: So, we should have had a chance to catch up at Farpoint Convention this year, but unfortunately the con had to be virtual due to the pandemic. What have you been up to?\n\nKelli: My tie-in story for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea just released in the Turning the Tied charity anthology from the International Association for Media Tie-In Writers. The Star Trek Adventures Shackleton Expanse sourcebook for which I was a contributing writer will be releasing this summer from Modiphius Entertainment.\n\nSherri: Nice! Let’s talk a little bit about your experience as an author for Star Trek. As a fan, who are some of your favorite characters and why?\n\nKelli: My favorite Star Trek character is Captain Janeway since I grew up watching her and was inspired by her leadership. I also love Voyager’s EMH for his quirky personality and the themes of personhood the show explores with his character. Other favorites include Jadzia Dax on DS9, and Discovery’s Jet Reno and Captain Pike.\n\nSherri: Captain Janeway was certainly an inspiration! As an author, how is writing for Star Trek different than, say, writing an original story?\n\nKelli: When writing tie-in fiction for a franchise like Star Trek, I must fit my story into existing canon, which means doing research and adhering to that universe’s established values, history, and laws of physics. Tie-in fiction also requires capturing each canon character’s unique voice. For example, I wanted the Doctor Crusher in my Strange New Worlds story to sound exactly like the Doctor Crusher fans know.\n\nSherri: That makes sense. What changes have you seen in the newer series? How is that a reflection of society?\n\nKelli: The new Star Trek series have given us solid representation of marginalized identities both on screen and in the writers’ room, resulting in a refreshing absence of male gaze and a distinct focus on the themes of justice and consequences. I think this updated perspective reflects our evolving society, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the increasingly unavoidable fallout of unchecked capitalism and runaway climate change. Science fiction is a commentary of the moment in which it is written, and Star Trek continues to be a compelling example.\n\nSherri: You’re an author and an educator. How do you see these roles interconnecting?\n\nKelli: Teaching and writing are both about guiding people into strange new worlds. For teaching to be effective, teacher and student must cooperate to accomplish growth, and the same is true of author and reader: they create shared meaning together in a beautifully collaborative act. In both of my careers, I see a common thread of hope for the future—I write Star Trek stories because I believe a better world is possible. I teach the next generation to make that possibility into reality.\n\nSherri: What authors do you admire and why?\n\nKelli: I really admire the works of Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler, Brooke Bolander, and Amal El-Mohtar. Their stories all engage with concepts of gender, justice, unorthodox love, and the best and worst of human nature, often from unexpected or subverted angles. Their prose is engaging and filled with striking imagery.\n\nSherri: If you were teaching a “Literature of Science Fiction” class, what novels and short stories would you use?\n\nKelli:\n\nNovels:\n\nThe Fifth Season (2015) by N. K. Jemison\n\nThe Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (2014) by Becky Chambers\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep (1992) by Vernor Vinge\n\nDawn (1987) by Octavia Butler\n\nThe Dispossessed (1974) by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nNovellas:\n\nThis is How You Lose the Time War (2019) by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\n\nThe Only Harmless Great Thing (2018)by Brooke Bolander\n\nShort stories:\n\n“Number Thirty-Nine Skink” (2017) by Suzanne Palmer\n\n“How the Damned Live On” (2016) by James Sallis\n\nThe Golden Apples of the Sun (1953) collectionby Ray Bradbury\n\nSerialized audio dramas:\n\nThe Sea in the Sky (2020) by Jackson Musker\n\nSteal the Stars (2017) by Nat Cassidy\n\nNo lineup could encompass the full diversity of sci-fi literature, and there are certainly problematic elements in some of these works, but I think these texts would serve as useful conversation points for analyzing the myriad ways sci-fi stories function, whose voices are being represented, and how the genre of “what if?” has evolved and will continue to evolve over time. Hopefully I’ll get to teach this class someday!\n\nSherri: I’d love to teach that class, too!\n\nSherri: I’m also happy to share that both Kelli and I have stories in the newly released anthology THRILLING ADVENTURE YARNS 2021. TAY 2021 is an array of 27 stories in the classic pulp style, replete with action and adventure, chills and thrills, mystery, Westerns, and much more! It can be purchased here, or you can enter the GIVEAWAY. Kelli, what was your inspiration for your story?\n\nKelli: My sci-fi noir story is titled “The Shadow Lady of Docktown” and it follows the adventures of a mercenary spy and her flying robot sidekick who uncover a police conspiracy. The story is set in the shadow of a great bridge, and a good chunk of it takes place inside a cathedral. I wanted to create a setting that channels the high-contrast aesthetic of noir as well as a kick-ass female anti-hero readers could root for.\n\nSherri: Awesome! Where can people find your stories? Where can folks sign up for your author newsletter or find you on social media?\n\nKelli: All of my stories are listed on the Publications tab of my website KelliFitzpatrick.com, with links to view or purchase. There is a newsletter sign-up box on the bottom of the home page of my website, or you can sign up for my newsletter here. You can find me on Twitter: @KelliFitzWrites."
