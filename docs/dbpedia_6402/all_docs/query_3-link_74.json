        "text": "Happy happy BOOK DAY, friends!\n\nI feel like I read a ton this month, so if I‚Äôm being honest, I was surprised when I sat down to do this post, and it was only four books. I really thought I read six. Random side note, but I must have double checked my notes four times to make sure. I *think* the reason that it felt like I read so many was that I read a variety, and they were all really, really good. Spoiler alert: there isn‚Äôt a bad book in the bunch today üôÇ .\n\nBefore we dive in, don‚Äôt forget that this year we now have A BOOK CLUB!!\n\nOnce a month, we will have a dedicated blog post for our monthly Book Club chat.\n\nIf you read March‚Äôs book, make sure you go back and take part in our discussion plus see what book we‚Äôll be reading in April.\n\nOkay, now, on to my MARCH 2024 reads!\n\nBook #1 this month was:\n\nThe Heiress by Rachel Hawkins\n\nAs many of you know, this was our MARCH BOOK CLUB pick! If you have read this book, please head to THIS POST to discuss. I you haven‚Äôt read this book, let me give you a few deets and also encourage you NOT to read the Book Club post as it does contain spoilers.\n\nCurious about The Heiress? Here is my little summary should you also want to dive in‚Ä¶\n\nThis novel is about a man returning home with his wife to his family‚Äôs manor after being gone for many, many years. The thing is, his very wealthy family is quite complicated. His mother had been widowed four times over, his extended family does not want him to return, and his wife‚Äôs enthusiasm for the trip far exceeds his own. This novel has twists and turns and in my opinion, is more ‚Äúsuspense‚Äù and less ‚Äúthriller‚Äù. It‚Äôs not scary, it‚Äôs just twisty and very entertaining. Other than some strong language, there is nothing really rated R about this one. Because it is a thriller, I don‚Äôt want to give anything away, but let‚Äôs just say, I was pleasantly surprised and grateful for the epilogue at the end. It‚Äôs a fun, easy to read book.\n\nBook #2:\n\nThe Lazy Genius by Kendra Adachi\n\nWell goodness, I LOVED THIS ONE!!\n\nI have heard The Office Ladies podcast chat about this author and her ‚Äúlazy genius‚Äù ways to make lives easier, so I decided to read her book. I know that she too has a podcast, but I wanted to read her book first and then start listening (which I‚Äôm doing now!). I love this woman! I feel like for the most part, I have my family‚Äôs life ‚Äútogether‚Äù enough, but after reading her book and learning about her ‚Äúlazy genius‚Äù ways, I‚Äôve made some really fabulous changes to simplify and streamline our family. Truly, I was jotting down notes left and right and have already started implanting so many of her very easy and practical strategies. I was so enthusiastic about this one that I immediately told Erika to read it and my mom too (it is not just for young families!).\n\nThere were just so many fabulous little nuggets of wisdom in this one.\n\nHere are just a few of my notes on this book:\n\n1: I love that the author‚Äôs goal is to encourage you to ‚Äúlearn what matters and skip what does not matter to you‚Äù. Yes and amen! This will look different for EVERY PERSON.\n\n2: ‚ÄúLife is about being real when you have it together and when you don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre BOTH real.‚Äù I personally thought that was a mic drop moment.\n\n3: ‚ÄúThe small choices we make over and over every single day contribute more to a meaningful life than the big decisions do.‚Äù I feel very, very passionate about this statement. I have a lot of ‚Äúbig‚Äù moments in my life, but by reading this blog, I hope you see that it‚Äôs truly the little details that really bring me the most joy.\n\n4: I decided, thanks to this book, to start using her ‚Äúpick one gift idea and repeat it all year‚Äù mantra. Ashby and Mades have both gone to friends‚Äô birthday parties this month, and I have now gifted everyone the same thing (Mades has another one tomorrow and guess what? Same gift!). This was such an easy little detail that was taking just a bit too much brain space for me. I love how now, I‚Äôve simplified this.\n\n5: Thanks to this book, we now have after school charcuterie boards at my house for the little girls. I have blogged specifically about this topic today as well, so make sure you CHECK OUT THAT POST for more details.\n\nI could keep going and going and going, but instead, you should read the book. Stat. Loved it!\n\nBook #3:\n\nThe Unfortunate Side Effects of Heartbreak and Magic by Breanne Randall\n\nMy sweet friend Lauren kept telling me to pick up this novel as it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor the fans of Practical Magic and Gilmore Girls‚Äù. Um, SOLD!\n\nYou guys, it was SO CUTE!! This little chick lit read was the perfect easy/happy/delightful novel to read this month. From the very first page, I was sucked into the charm.\n\nJust so you know, this is not about ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù (a topic that doesn‚Äôt interest me), it‚Äôs about a charming little town and all the people who live and work there in their adorable little shops (very downtown McKinney or Nantucket sounding) and the family who owns the little bake shop doesn‚Äôt just put ‚Äúlove‚Äù into their baking, but a little ‚Äúhappy magic‚Äù. Every detail made me want to step inside this fictitious world. I loved the description of their cozy home, their garden and yard, their bake shop‚Ä¶there is, of course, a little family drama, a little romance and just oodles of charm.\n\nIf you want something sweet and happy to read, here you go.\n\nAnd finally‚Ä¶\n\nBook #4:\n\nExpiration Dates by Rebecca Serle\n\nWell, as you know, I just adore this author üôÇ .\n\nIn 2020, I named her book In Five Years in my TOP THREE for the entire year!\n\nIn 2018, I named her novel The Dinner List one of my favorite books of the year, and in 2022, I was OBSESSED with her novel One Italian Summer as well. If you haven‚Äôt read any of these three novels, you should start with THOSE BOOKS before any of the ones today. All three of these Serle novels are BRILLIANT.\n\nNeedless to say, I had already pre-ordered Serle‚Äôs newest novel and timed my other book reading for the month so that the day it was released, I could immediately start Expiration Dates. Now, I really enjoyed this book, but it was by far my least favorite from this author to date. Do I think you should still read it? YES! Do I think it stands up to her other three? No.\n\nSerle has this very specific kind of writing style where her books can have a slight ‚Äúfar fetched‚Äù element to them, but they just w-o-r-k even if it‚Äôs not 100% realistic. This novel is about a young woman who receives expiration dates for each of her relationships. Now, let me be clear, I am going to not explain much further because there was a big twist that I didn‚Äôt see coming that really sucked me in even deeper (and I was already sucked in!). This novel is very original, very thought-provoking and much deeper than what lies on the surface. Why didn‚Äôt I love it as much as the others? I don‚Äôt know? The story wasn‚Äôt as strong? It needed an epilogue to tie up some loose ends? The sub characters didn‚Äôt quite have enough depth? Or maybe I just really, really loved the other three?\n\nIf you‚Äôre a fan of hers already, read it‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre new to her books, here are four you should dive into.\n\nOkay, that wraps up BOOK REVIEW DAY!\n\nOne more thing though before we go. You know that I don‚Äôt normally tell you what I‚Äôm reading going into the next month, buuuuut I‚Äôm going to share my first book with you that will be on our April Book Review next month‚Ä¶\n\nI picked this book up yesterday here on Nantucket and while I waited for my coffee, I started reading a few pages‚Ä¶and then, I couldn‚Äôt put it down. I sat on a bench in front of the coffee shop for almost an hour reading and during that time not one but TWO different women walked past me and said ‚ÄúOh my gosh, I could not put that book down!‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt finished it year (I‚Äôm hoping to do that on the flight home today!), but so far, I think it‚Äôs fantastic!\n\nWhew!
