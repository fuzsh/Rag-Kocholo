(We aren’t kidding around in the headline for this piece!)\n\nOK, this is your absolute last warning….\n\nNow that we’ve taken care of that business, let’s dive into the biggest movie plot twists of all time!\n\n“No, I am your father.” “Soylent Green is people!” “Rosebud.” “What’s in the box?” “I see dead people.”\n\nThose are all lines of dialogue related to some of the most shocking revelations in film history. They might have been the clue to the twist, or perhaps they were the twist itself, but either way, they packed a punch with audiences.\n\nIn an interview with Jake Hamilton, The Sixth Sense and Split filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan — the master of twist endings — explained his process to creating an impact. “What you’re left with at the end of the movie should tell you what you saw…. When you stick the landing you’re giving them the keys to say, ‘This is how to interpret everything that you watched,'” he said.\n\nBelow, take a look at some of the most memorable film twists ever.\n\nWritten by Patrick Brzeski, Tyler Coates, Ryan Gajewski, James Hibberd, Hilary Lewis, Kimberly Nordyke, Lexy Perez, Christy Piña, Carly Thomas and Etan Vlessing"
