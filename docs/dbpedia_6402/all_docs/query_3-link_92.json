        "text": "Just when you think you have read everything possible about WWII, a book comes out that completely surprises you. I had no idea about the economic battle that was waged as part of the effort to beat the Germans, and not only end the war, but prevent future wars. This book may be heavy on economics, but it is completely surprising and riveting.\n\nAnsel Luxford and his wife Angela are living a comfortable life. He is a successful tax attorney, and they are raising their beautiful new baby in their own home. However, they want to do more to help as war is raging in Europe. Ansel finds a way to join a clandestine team within the Treasury Department that is tasked with undermining the German economy.\n\nThis book reads more like a thriller with spies and traitors battling Nazis and Fascists amidst the halls of the US Government and the boardrooms of Wall Street. Some of the economic explanations are a bit involved, but they add to the understanding of how this plot came together. A thoroughly enjoyable story and a view into a relatively unknown battlefield during the War. This is a work of fiction based on actual characters and incidents.\n\nMy thanks to NetGalley and Random House for an advance ecopy. My opinion is my own.\n\nIn 1939, Ansel Luxford has everything a person could want--a career, a spouse and a new baby. However he is obsessed by a belief that Europe is on the edge of a war that will grow to consume the world. The United States is officially proclaiming neutrality in any foreign conflict, but when Ansel is offered an opportunity to move to Washington, D.C., to join a clandestine project within the Treasury Department that is working to undermine Nazi Germany, he uproots his family overnight and takes on the challenge of a lifetime. To thwart the Nazis, Ansel and his team invent a powerful theater of battle: economic warfare. Money is a dangerous weapon, and Ansel's efforts will plunge him into a world full of espionage, peril, and deceit. He will crisscross the globe to broker backroom deals, undertake daring heists, and spar with industry titans like J.P. Morgan and the century's greatest economic Britain mind, When Ansel's wife takes a job with the FBI to hunt for spies within the government, the need for subterfuge extends to the home front.\n\nThis novel is is a gripping thriller about the mysterious powers of money, the lies worth telling to defeat evil, and a hidden war that shaped the modern world. I would never had expected this novel to inform me about the powers of money. It is a little surprising for me to think of money as having a power that was addressed in the novel. It’s an amazing novel.\n\nWhenever I come across a book by Graham Moore mixed emotions follow. Do I really want to tackle the extraordinary linguistics, mental gymnastics and dedicated attention that are required?! And each and every time I dive in I am astounded by how interesting Moore can make a dry topic. He did it with electricity in The Last Days of Night and he has done it again with Keynesian Economics in The Wealth of Shadows. Wrapped up in a shadowy WWII semi-historical story the characters come alive in their deviousness, their duplicity, their ego driven quest to be right. But is it for themselves, for love of country or something very different? The story is so well told that I was never quite sure who was really the outlier, who was the contrarian, who was playing who against who, who was going to give everyone up for the glory, the money, the politics, the virtue, the constancy of belief. Whose theory is going to be believed and put to use and how is going to get done?\n\nI didn’t race through this book and I admit to rereading pages multiple times but I never wanted to put it down. I loved so many of the quotes, especially those cherry picked gems spoken by The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffet. There is little that is more interesting than historical fiction when it is well told. Moore has created this great thriller about the people who came together and their plan to destroy Nazi Germany through the use of economics.\n\nMany thanks to Random House and NetGalley for a copy of this thought provoking book.\n\nThe Wealth of Shadows\n\nA Novel\n\nby Graham Moore\n\n(This review is based on an ARC sent to me by NetGalley)\n\nFrom the author’s note:\n\n“An economic writer requires from his reader much goodwill and intelligence and a large measure of cooperation”\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nThis is a work of historical fiction but contains quite a bit of history.\n\nAccording to the author every major character depicted in the novel existed This is a story about economic warfare In Minnesota, government employee Ansel Luxford is horrified at the looming Nazi threat and he goes to work for the U.S. Treasury Department with a plan to fight Hitler when the hostilities began with Hitler invading Poland.\n\nThe United States was neutral but needed to find a way to provided critical goods to France and Great Britain. The largest single source for the novel is The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White and the making of a New World Order by Benn Steil.\n\nOnce America is in the war, talk turns to the future: Could a world bank and an international monetary fund prevent future global conflicts?\n\nUsing meticulous research, the author recounts a little-known aspect of the fight against the Nazis. The reader learns about economic theory, with vigorous debates about the value of the dollar versus sterling.\n\nThe Wealth of Shadows will appeal to readers who like historically based thrillers.\n\nDNF @15%\n\nOhhhhhhh this book is absolutely not for me. At all. I had to listen to the beginning twice and I still have no idea what is really happening and my confusion just grew because I just didn't understand and I was left frustrated and with little desire to read this book.\n\nI have Dyscalculia and so books that deeply involve maths or concepts of finance are really difficult for me and I should have done more research [and will do so in the future] before accepting this book. I am disappointed, but also glad I recognized what the issue was early on so I didnt continue on in frustration.\n\nI am sure this is a magnificent book [I am seeing so many good reviews about it] and even though I cannot read it, I will be recommending it to my friends and family.\n\nI was invited to read.review this book by the publisher [Random House Publishing Group/Random House] and I thank them, NetGalley, and Graham Moore for the opportunity to read this ARC.\n\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android\n\nWealth of Shadows ✨ REVIEW ✨\n\nIf you would’ve told me that a WW2 “mostly true” historical fiction story showing the financial underbelly of the government’s motives leading up to the war, I would’ve assumed it would be heavy and slow. But no! Waging financial war on the Nazi’s while trying to remain neutral is riveting stuff! This book is based on real people working in the US Treasury Department , it’s fascinating for the average (financially interested) person and it’s full of espionage and twists and thriller-esque moments. It’s no wonder the author has written award-winning screenplays (hello, The Imitation Game) because he makes us care about the characters and feel invested in the scenes used push the story forward. You’ll find yourself googling the main players, wanting to verify and know more once the book ends.\n\nDon’t miss the Author’s Note at the end where each chapter is addressed— and you see what actually occurred vs the places he added some embellishment. You’ll be shocked, you’ll learn about the origins of the World Bank and you’ll be the most investing person at your next party. Who knew to expect this? I can’t wait to backtrack and read his first novel, The Last Days Of Night.\n\n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\nThank you to my first (eeeek!) @netgalley read (and thank you to @randomhouse ) for the ARC. All opinions here are my own.\n\nI really like how Graham Moore writes. Regardless of the subject, I'm always glued to the page. It may be because of his work as a screenwriter but it really feels like a movie when I'm reading his books. It just flows so well; the pacing is really well done even if all we're following is conversation about economics. But I found it really thrilling.\n\nI love that he finds interesting point of views to known events. I loved that we got to see the current war through the perspective of a lawyer but at the same time the technical eyes were still there (which I loved). I really like how he merges the historical facts with a specific field and just goes for it. It's just so interesting to follow the characters finding ways to combat Germany's aggression during WWII using economy.\n\nI just really loved the book\n\nThank you Netgalley, author, and publisher for the ARC.\n\nThis novel is based on a true story. Ansel Luxford is tasked to bring down the Nazi regime via economics. He moves to Washington, DC to work on the strategy. His wife and baby accompany him. Soon his wife gets a job at the FBI which might conflict with the work Ansel's doing. Manipulating funds to bring down the Nazi regime is an aspect I never heard of before. This is a fascinating story which I doubt many have heard before this book was published earlier this year.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the chance to read prior to publication.\n\nSet at the precipice of World War II, this book follows a clandestine group in America tasked with preventing the Nazi Regime from taking over Europe without breaking the stance of neutrality. This is primarily done through economic warfare and because of their actions, many of the institutions and policies they set in place are still there today. Overall, an interesting historical fiction novel highlighting a relatively unknown group of people who played a part in ending WWII. There is a lot of economic theory and legal wording discussed and some sections require closer attention to grasp what's being explained, but it's very interesting to see the groundwork for what we see today.\n\nThis book would be of interest to those who :\n\n*find economics interestng\n\n*enjoy pre WWII history interesting\n\n*are interested in learning new aspects to the rise of WWII\n\n*learning about the US's little known tool they used against Germany - the US Treasury\n\nI wouldn't call this a thriller like The Last Days of Night or fascinating insight into a little known historical figure like The Imitation Game, but it was interesting learning about how the US used so many ways to try to stop Hitler and the rise of the Nazi's. \"Good guys\" and \"bad guys\" aren't always clearly wearing white hats or black masks. And I learned a lot about economics which I still find somewhat interesting.\n\nEvery chapter begins with a quote and can't suggest enough that readers should pay attention to these gems!\n\n\"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\" - Warren Buffet\n\n\"When goods do not cross your borders, soldiers will.\" -Frederic Bastiat\n\n\"Teach a parrot the words 'supply' and 'demand' and you've got an economist.\" - Thomas Carlyle\n\n\"Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\" - Warren Buffet\n\n\"I would never read a book...I don't want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that. I think, if you wrote a book...it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.\" - Sam Bankman-Fried\n\nMy thanks to Net Galley and Random House for an advanced copy of this e-book.\n\nI asked for this book because it was written by Graham Moore. I really didn’t know if I was up for yet another WWII book. What is with all of the WWII books right now? But I like the writer so I dove in. I liked the story of the war no one sees. The brains behind the war. There have been other stories told about the other side of war. The brain side. I was fascinated by the things people came up with to take down the enemy on a whole different field of battle. If you are getting a little burned out on war books but love a good nerdy, mathy plot, don’t’ pas this one by.\n\nThe Wealth of Shadows, by Graham Moore, is a historical thriller set during World War 2. This novel has an interesting spin on the typical war story by focusing on a different group of characters, the economists and lawyers, who attack the Nazis behind the scenes with weapons that aren’t guns and bombs. There is also an extended plan put into place that will establish a post-war world that economically allies countries in such a way that should prevent future wars.\n\nWhat’s fascinating about his story is the inclusion of historical figures and events interspersed into the narrative. The author does something unique by clarifying the distinction between the fiction and non-fiction elements. Though it contains heavier, mathematically focused content at times, it’s a unique premise. The Wealth of Shadows wasn’t quite a bingeable and captivating as the author’s previous book, but it’s still an engaging and intriguing story. If you are a fan of historical novels, especially those with a suspenseful twist, this is a must read for you!"
