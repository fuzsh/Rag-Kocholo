I think I need a break.\n\nLife has been pretty stressful for me and unfortunately, my blog and my desire to blog has taken a hit. I love writing reviews for the books I read, but I’ve found that I can’t find the motivation or the creativity for anything else. I know that some of you like my reviews while others are here more for the creative posts, which is fine, but I find myself solely reading books to write reviews about them instead of reading them because I want to.\n\nIf you haven’t noticed, my TBRs tend to be full of ARCs I’ve agreed to read or blog tours I’m participating in. While I love doing these, I think I flew too close to the sun, and I’m finding myself feeling drained. Reading is becoming more like a chore than a hobby and blogging is starting to follow suit.\n\nI don’t want to myself burnt out and lose joy in these things, so I think a break would be best for me.\n\nI will still post in October for the things I’ve agreed to post for, but I’m not going to be sticking with the five days a week schedule I’ve been doing. If I decide to write a review for a book I read or think of a fun post I want to do, then I will do them, but I’m not going to hold myself accountable if nothing inspires me.\n\nI’m going to call this a mini hiatus – I’m not sure how long I’m going to take a break for, but the plan right now is just for the month of October. My friend Alexa did one in August and I could tell it really helped her fall back in love with reading and blogging. Not needing to focus on content oddly helps you focus on content if that makes any sense.\n\nI think this will be good for me. While I’m obviously nervous all my hardwork will just fall down the drain, I know that taking a step back and giving myself time again will ultimately be a good thing. I’ve been consistently blogging five days a week for over a year and a half now, with maybe a vacation week here and there, so this is going to feel very weird for me. I hope you choose to stick around for when I come back and enjoy the few posts that go up while on hiatus!\n\nBefore I depart, I want to say thank you to everyone for all your support. It means the world that so many people read my words and my thoughts and stick around to read more. I could never imagine the growth of this blog or the opportunities that have opened up from blogging or even the friends I’ve made in the community. I appreciate everyone who’s left a nice comment, or consistently liked every post I put out, and I couldn’t be more thankful!\n\nThank you all for all your support and I look forward to seeing you all again in November!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReview: Lakesedge\n\nI’m not going to lie, when I got an email with a link to download this book from the publisher, I didn’t even read the synopsis.

A lot of sad, stressful things happened in a short amount of time and I’m still not recovered from it. On Monday morning, we woke up to find out our fish had died. I gave my fiance that fish as a present 4 years ago and he was with us through everything. He was a blood parrot cichlid named Smiley and he was so lively. He would swim up to greet you and do tricks, like flipping upside down for us. We are both so sad that he passed. And that was just the icing on the shit week I’ve been having. I won’t even go into the other stuff I’ve been dealing with, but I’ll summarize with lots of tears and lots of arguing. Not fun.\n\nI’m going on and on about life. You’re not here for that.

Sky Breaker isn’t living up to what I wanted. I remember liking Night Spinner, the first book, but this one jumped right back in so I was very confused.

Hopefully Spells Trouble is better.\n\nWATCHING\n\nI watched a few episodes of Shadow and Bone, but I want to be able to sit down and binge it, so I’m waiting until I move and things calm down.

Time is flying by so quickly and this month was no exception. Looking back at what I read, I was not only shocked at how much I read, but the fact that I was forgetting the books I read this month. Time is moving so slow and so fast at the same time, I can’t keep up. Anyways, here’s what I read for April and if you want to see what I plan to read in May, check out my TBR here!\n\nI also linked all of the reviews that are posted for these books, so if you want to read my thoughts, check out the reviews below!\n\nTell Me My Name by Amy Reed\n\nGenre: YA Thriller\n\nRating: 1 // 5 stars (DNF @ 42%)\n\nGoodreads\n\nA Dark and Hollow Star by Ashley Shuttleworth\n\nGenre: YA Fantasy\n\nRating: 4.5 // 5 stars\n\nGoodreads\n\nIn Deeper Waters by F.T.

It felt like I had read nothing, but looking back, I actually got through a lot more. I basically finished my TBR last month which was surprising and awesome at the same time. I need to keep up this momentum into May!\n\nWhat was your favorite book you read in April? It’s so hard to pick, but I think it would have to be a three way tie between Our Last Echoes, What’s Not to Love, and The Ones We’re Meant to Find. And These Feathered Flames is a very close second!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nARC Review: Counting Down With You\n\nI have been on a contemporary kick and this book scratched all of the itches I had!

Wish me luck.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nARC Review: What’s Not to Love\n\nAh high school. It’s so bizarre to think I graduated six years ago. I haven’t walked the halls or gone to classes and yet this book pulled me right back in and I loved it.
