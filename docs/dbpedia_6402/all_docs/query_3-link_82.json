        "text": "Resting Witch Face by Juliette Cross\n\nDo you love steamy fantasy romances, paranormal elements, and all the LOL moments? Then you need to pick up this series by Juliette Cross!\n\nIt’s called Stay A Spell and it follows a coven of sister witches in New Orleans as they find their meant-to-be, happily ever after beaus. In the New Orleans they live in, there are supernaturals divided into factions of witches, werewolves, vampires, and reapers. It’s SO much fun. Six books are currently out and I’ll quickly recap them below before we completely jump into all things Resting Witch Face.\n\nResting Witch Face, book 5 in the series, is the story of Jules, the eldest of the Savoie sisters, Enforcer of New Orleans, and siphon witch with telekenetic powers, and Ruben, NOLA's Vampire Overlord— FINALLY! We’ve gotten so many hints towards these two over the past several books and I’m so happy we’re finally with them! And, overall, I’ve just loved how easy it is to get lost in this series... Whenever I've picked up one of the books, it truly has never *felt* like I was reading and that's just the best kind of story, right?? But, before we dive in further, let’s recap the current books in the series.\n\nThe Stay A Spell Series So Far\n\nFirst, we have Wolf Gone Wild, book 1, which follows Mateo (a werewolf and artist) and Evie (one of our sister witches and curse breaker). It’s spunky and fresh and oh, have I mentioned?! This is 100% a steamy, steamy romance series.\n\nNext is Don’t Hex and Drive and you guessed it, book 2. It follows Isadora (another of the Savoie sister witches and a witch with healing powers), and Devraj (a vampire and Strygon, a legendary vampire warrior). This book is charming and sweet and has a compelling underlying mystery (as book 1 does).\n\nAfter that is Witches Get Stitches and yes, book 3. It follows Violet (one of the sister twins and powerful seer) and Nico (a werewolf and singer/songwriter) as they expertly avoid their feelings for each other, open a tattoo shop together, and try to find a way to permanently help the werewolf community. Nico is actually Mateo’s cousin, too!\n\nBook 3.5, Walking In A Witchy Wonderland, is an anthology and a swoony, magical holiday glimpse into the lives of our favorite couples (and couples to be)! We get 5 short stories that happen alongside and within the confines of the first 3 novels with the cleverest titles and the most bewitching moments.\n\nAlways Practice Safe Hex, book 4, is Livvy and Gareth's story where we get to learn more about Grims! It’s safe to say I am fascinated by them. This next installment in the Savoie Sisters' world is simultaneously dark and edgy yet beautiful, sincere, and meaningful. It definitely has darker themes, so check those content warnings before diving in.\n\nTap on the book cover to check out my full reviews on Instagram!"
