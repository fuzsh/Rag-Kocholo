        "text": "\"The original is classic, but the remake is masterful.\"\n\nRecently, I asked the BuzzFeed Community to share a movie remake they like more than the original. The results were interesting, to say the least.\n\n*NOTE* Not every remake is a line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake. It can be argued that some of these are re-imaginings and reboots. Don't stress over it too much. I am counting it if it is a movie with the same premise and title.\n\n1. \"The first movie I think of is the remake of The Parent Trap (1998).\"\n\n2. \"Denis Villeneuve’s Dune (2021) is much better than the original Dune. I love both of them, but the original is more nostalgic as opposed to a captivating film. The acting in the new one is better, as is the CGI. I feel a stronger connection with the characters. Overall, just a better adaptation.\"\n\n3. \"The Lion King (2019). I am a huge fan of grounded realism, and the voice talent was solid. The mood is there, there is more substance filled into this film, and it closes a handful of plot holes. It really feels like you're out there experiencing the world. I was immersed from start to finish, big and small. Sure, the humor is different, but the expansion of certain elements such as 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' being an ensemble, were some of my favorite highlights that made the film thrive.\"\n\n4. \"Mean Girls (2024). I love Reneé Rapp and she did so well.\"\n\n5. \"I have to say The Invisible Man (2020) with Elisabeth Moss. It was a damn good movie! It was a very interesting way to use the concept of the original Invisible Man (1933) as a basis for a more modern, sophisticated horror film!\"\n\n6. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is better than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Johnny Depp is just creepy enough, the oompa loopas were definitely better, and I love the backstory.\"\n\n7. \"The Karate Kid (2010) because Jackie Chan is a true martial artist and they expand the depth of the teacher.\"\n\n8. \"Ghostbusters (2016) with the gals. The original cast was great, but you know what, so were Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon. Chris Hemsworth was hysterical as their assistant, too. I don’t understand the hate for this movie at all and never will.\"\n\n9. \"I'm gonna get roasted for this, but I genuinely liked the Beauty and the Beast (2017) more than the original. Emma Watson's acting in it is meh but everyone else was so wonderful. I loved the songs, the beast was great, the scenery was beautiful. It's become kind of a comfort film.\"\n\n10. \"Pride & Prejudice (2005). They did a good job of condensing the story to some of the more crucial parts while still communicating the classic love story. The cinematography is beautiful and the actors gave superb performances.\"\n\n11. \"Scarface (1983) is probably the greatest remake of all time since most people don't even know that there is an original movie.\"\n\n12. \"The Woman In Black (1989) might stick closer to the book's plot, but I vastly prefer the 2012 version. The Woman had pretty much stopped bothering to kill children in the original, so bringing back that threat made the whole thing much scarier.\"\n\n13. \"True Grit (2010) is much better than the John Wayne version from 1969. I usually badmouth remakes, but this one is an exception.\"\n\n14. \"A Star is Born (2018). I prefer the music in this one with songs like 'Shallow,' 'Black Eyes,' 'Always Remember Us This Way,' and many more. I like the acting better as well.\"\n\n15. \"Cinderella (2015). It had more backstory and depth than just 'man sees pretty woman and fancies himself in love.' We got to see Ella's life prior to the arrival of her step-mother, and more of the Prince's life, too, which I think added to the story. And let's be honest, the ballroom scene is just breathtaking!\"\n\n16. \"The Producers (2005) remake is so much better than the 1968 film.\"\n\n17. \"Point Break (2015) is so much better than the original. Admittedly, the acting in the new one is atrocious (you can’t beat Patrick Swayze in that role), but man…those stunts and the cinematography are breathtaking.\"\n\n18. \"Possibly controversial, but I'm going to go with the Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) being better than the original. Whilst the original is more intense and has put me off playing the board game version for as long as I live, the remake is just more appealing to me.\"\n\n19. \"The new It (2017) is so much better.\"\n\n20. \"The remake of Carrie (2013) with Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. The original is classic but the remake is masterful.\"\n\n21. \"I'm gonna go with David Cronenberg's The Fly...Cronenberg takes the premise and adds gory, gross realism to it and adds a level of tragedy not found in the original that just makes it more compelling.\"\n\n22. \"Little Women (2019) is a superior remake that far exceeds the original. It was never boring or slow and had me honestly completely convinced it would end differently. Also, every time Meryl Streep came on screen I was immediately addicted. She really is one of the greatest actresses of all time.\"\n\n23. \"Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria. I love the original Dario Argento version, but more as a campy horror flick. But Guadagnino's was just a crazier and more gut-wrenching experience. It took the basic plot of the original and expanded on it so much, and while the gore of the original is substantial, this one had some scenes that were just...wow.\"\n\n24. \"Dredd. It seemed more real and Karl Urban did a great job. I also liked the original.\"\n\n25. \"Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween—so dark and psychological; so intense compared to Carpenter's original.\"\n\n26. \"The Man Who Knew Too Much. Maybe it’s because the original is in black and white and the remake is in color, but I get the feeling Hitchcock felt better about doing it with James Stewart…and it shows.\"\n\n27. \"Sabrina (1995). Harrison Ford threaded the line between aloof & warm better than Humphrey Bogart.\"\n\n28. \"Don (2006) is better than the original Don (1978). The new one has better visuals, better fight sequences, and most of all, a better ending twist.\"\n\n29. \"Friday the 13th (2009) is a greatest hits album of the first four.\"\n\n30. \"The original Dawn of the Dead (1978) by George R. Romero was a classic. It was a great weekend midnight movie. However, Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (2004) turned it into an action movie with amazing zombie gags, great acting, and an incredible music score. I can watch it over and over.\"\n\n31. And lastly, \"John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). One of Kurt Russell's iconic performances in one of Carpenter's best-directed films. No CGI, fantastic practical effects by Rob Bottin.\"\n\nI bet there is a remake you like more than the original. Let me know in the comment section below (And be nice to one another!).\n\nShare This Article"
