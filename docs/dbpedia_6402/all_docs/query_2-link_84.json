The Art Cinema was the first moving picture house in Pittsburgh to commercially show art movies until competition from other city theaters led to its conversion to an adult movie house in the 1960s. As part of its mission to transform the Cultural District, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust purchased and restored the facility leading to further conversions of run-down properties along the Liberty Avenue corridor. With a total of 194 seats, including a fully restored balcony, the Harris Theater officially opened to the public for movies and live performances on November 9, 1995. The theater is one of the few that has retained 35mm film projectors that are utilized regularly.\n\nThe Harris was named through a gift from the Buhl Foundation after John P. Harris, co-founder of the Nickelodeon—the first theater solely dedicated to the showing of motion pictures—and a Pennsylvania State Senator. The Harris Theater features contemporary, foreign, and classic films.\n\nFilms For All\n\nThe Harris Theater has installed the necessary equipment to provide closed movie captioning and audio description to patrons for digital films that offer these features. Films with captioning and audio description available will be noted when available.\n\nSupport the Harris Theater and Become a Member!\n\nHelp keep the projectors running at the Harris Theater by making a membership gift to support the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
