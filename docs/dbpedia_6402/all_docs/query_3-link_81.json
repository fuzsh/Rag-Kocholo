        "text": "Struggle for the northern frontier and other lost tales of old Florida\n\nMy three books uses turkeys as part of the story.\n\nNative American iconography, behavior, feathers and food (everyone loves turkeys) and includes turkeys as pets for the early settlers of Florida.\n\nBook front & back page\n\nAmazon link: to Book One of FREEDOM'S QUEST trilogy.\n\nThe link is for the paperback book -\n\nAuthor's discussion (that's me) on You Tube of a book review on Amazon\n\nWell, I did it.\n\nI wrote Three books of fictional stories set in various time frames of old Florida.\n\nBook One FREEDOM'S QUEST is on Amazon.\n\nI was delayed when the publishers told me I had to split the story into three manuscripts.\n\nBook One:\n\nHernando de Soto's dispirited army leaves the fog shrouded Appalachian mountains and enters the corn rich lands of the south eastern United States. Facing increasing hostility, Soto sends sends his scouts on a dangerous assignment to Tampa Bay.\n\nLuis Castillo, the emotionally distraught Captain of the scouts leads his team through a land ravaged by war and disease. A quest that eventually leads him to the Indian River Lagoon south of Cape Canaveral and the town of Ulumay inhabited by the Native Americans known as Ais.\n\nWhat? Bad language!\n\nLanguage and violence warning.\n\nPerhaps that was a poor choice; however, I kept the rude language because when I was in the armed forces, we often spoke similar words. It wasn't pretty. Perhaps it was a lack of manners. But it is how we talked. And I suspect that anytime someone is under a great deal of stress, the cruder the language.\n\nThe violence? Freedoms Quest is a collection of sometimes violent stories and stories of hope that redefine the lost history of Florida.\n\nFlorida History:\n\nThe subject matter was not complicated. I have always been an avid history buff, as reflected in my two (so far) websites.\n\nThe Evil of Hernando De Soto, a brief talk on my YouTube Channel\n\nArt (above) by the State of Florida at Ichetucknee Springs\n\nThe massacre of prisoners at Matanzas Inlet.\n\nSeptember 29, 1565, Men√©ndez orders the execution of the Huguenots.\n\nPainting credit: Unknown. I took the picture in the Jacksonville Museum.\n\nThe basic overview:\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Florida's violent past, the Freedom's Quest series is a panoramic vision that follows the history of three families as conquistadors, slaves, Native Americans and soldiers. Stories of violence and hope that redefine the lost history of Florida and the desperate struggle against the incursions across the northern frontier.\n\nWhile the characters are purely fictional, the storied facts and events told in the stories are true.\n\nMy goal was to capture how people may have responded to these events and tell their stories in a manner altogether different than how history has been taught.\n\nHernando De Soto's four year rampage across southeastern North America\n\nBook One\n\nHernando De Soto's rampage across southeastern North America was recorded in the Journal of Elvas. Soto's use of 500 chained native Americans to carry baggage was planned and evil.\n\nDiseases swept the New World, often destroying entire communities of the Native Americans of the Mississippian culture before ever coming into actual contact with a live European.\n\nAt Matanzas inlet on the east coast of Florida, the Spanish murdered their French prisoners of war.\n\nBook Two: End of Empire\n\nThe King of Spain offered freedom to English slaves who would flee to Spanish Florida and swear service to the King.\n\nThe raids into Florida by Native Americans allied with the English depopulated Florida of the original native Americans already devastated by European diseases.\n\nBloody Fort Mose was & raid and counter raid.\n\nThe wreck of the treasure \"Plate\" fleet on the Florida east coast was the most significant sinking of gold and silver in history.\n\nBook Three\n\nThe American incursions into Florida culminated in events such as the explosion of the Negro Fort on the Apalachicola River & the death of 300 men, women, and children by an American gunship.\n\nThe destruction of the African community of Angola by Native Americans from the north, resulted in both Africans and Seminoles fleeing to the Bahamas.\n\nAndrew Jackson's incursions into Spanish Florida and the costly seven-year-long \"Second Seminole war\" were devastating events.\n\nBook Two: Available on Amazon November 2023\n\nMy apology at how I used the Native American names for clans and tribes.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, I kept to the standard history book Anglicized names of the indigenous peoples, with a complete understanding these names were seldom, if it all, how native peoples actually referred to themselves or their tribal affiliations.\n\nThis is a work of fiction. The tribal names are used only as representative of a region. The people are purely fictional and do not refer to and are not meant to be representative of any Indigenous People of the New World.\n\nAnd the references to the origins of the Seminole Nations of Florida or Oklahoma are purely conjectured with no intention of conveying any facts.\n\nThe stories do intend to convey the incredible blending of cultures in the new world of the Americas. At least for those who would survive the experiment.\n\nI made a separate page for the \"World building of lost Florida\" trips, mostly a photographic journey through areas of Florida. Call me a modern day William Bartram.\n\nAbout the author\n\nBruce Ryba, amateur historian, flintknapper, explorer, and expedition kayak racer. Fisherman.\n\nWhile serving in the United States Air Force, a serendipitous assignment to humid Cape Canaveral, Florida resulted in careers, first as a diver for the Air Force Eastern Test Range and then as a communications specialist at Kennedy Space Center during the Space Shuttle Program.\n\nAnd the chance to dive into Florida's lost stories.\n\nDawn on the Missouri River\n\nAll characters in Freedom's Quest are the product of my imagination and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.\n\nHave you heard of Kindle Vella?\n\nAmazon/KDP encourages writers to join and write serial stories.\n\nTo read the serial stories, the first three chapters are free and KDP will charge tokens to view the next chapters.\n\nPlease check out my dystopian Science Fiction stories \"Woodpecker\"\n\nBeware. The stories may redefine the word dystopia. (The future, past and present blend as travels are reincarnated as fallen astronauts and fallen angels, DNA experiments, vamps, demons and old gods.)\n\nChapters 1-3 are no cost & does not to hurt look if you are into my blend of stories. Then flee.\n\nOr look anyway and see if you might want to join Kindle Vella with your own stories!"
