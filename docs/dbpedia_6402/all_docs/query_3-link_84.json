A life-long lover of classic literature (and life-long Penguin Classics superfan), Elizabeth has played a key role in bringing new contemporary voices to Penguin Classics, including Elif Batuman, Claire Vaye Watkins, Brandon Taylor, Joy Harjo, Rachel Syme, Kate Bolick, and Gloria Steinem. While she is constantly working to strengthen Penguin Classics’ impressive roster of feminist voices, she is also excited about expanding the traditional idea of the “canon” to include more underrepresented voices, and is especially interested in publishing more Latinx, Black, Asian, and Indigenous authors in Penguin Classics. She was heavily involved in the creation of the prestigious Penguin Vitae series and is actively looking for contemporary writers to contribute to future classics that will be added to the ongoing series. Her list for Penguin Classics includes The Women’s Suffrage Movement by Sally Roesch Wagner, A Nation of Women by Luisa Capetillo, The Portable Anna Julia Cooper edited by Shirley Moody-Turner, and The Gates Ajar by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, as well as new editions of beloved classics like Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence, Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady, Kate Chopin’s The Awakening, Rona Jaffe’s The Best of Everything, James Welch’s Winter in the Blood, E.M. Forster’s A Room with a View, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wall-Paper. Elizabeth also manages the @PenguinClassics Instagram and would love if you gave it a follow!"
