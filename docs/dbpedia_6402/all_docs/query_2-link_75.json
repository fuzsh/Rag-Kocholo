Martin.\n\nThe historic Jean Cocteau Cinema is not just an eclectic arthouse theater and bar, it is a unique event space that is truly transforming the entertainment scene in Santa Fe and is a mainstay of the Santa Fe community in the Railyard District. We are hosts to artists, singers, comedians, magicians, drag kings and queens, and of course, authors! We aim to create a unique experience by pairing films with curated themed cocktails at our full bar, to having customizable charcuterie amidst the expected movie theater concessions. Whether you’re looking for a unique event in Santa Fe, or want to rent the cinema for your very own party—the Jean Cocteau Cinema has it all!\n\nWe are NOW OPEN 3pm-10pm Wednesday thru Monday (closed Tuesday unless stated)\n\nThe Jean Cocteau Cinema is now open WEDNESDAY-MONDAY from 3PM-10PM! So even if you don’t have time for a show, you can hangout with our brilliant bartenders at the Jean Cocteau Cinema Lobby Bar, which is tucked away inside our theatre lobby and is fully stocked with wine, beer on tap, and everything to create a memorable craft cocktail or mocktail with friends, family, or colleagues before an event. Plus, don’t miss out on themed drinks every weekend or for special programs!"
