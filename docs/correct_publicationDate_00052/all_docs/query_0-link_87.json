Beginning with dozens of plays and musical comedies produced in the 1960s and 70s, Card's first published fiction appeared in 1977--the short story \"Gert Fram\" in the July issue of The Ensign, and the novelette version of \"Ender's Game\" in the August issue of Analog.\n\nThe novel-length version of Ender's Game, published in 1984 and continuously in print since then, became the basis of the 2013 film, starring Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, Hailee Steinfeld, Viola Davis, and Abigail Breslin.\n\nCard was born in Washington state, and grew up in California, Arizona, and Utah. He served a mission for the LDS Church in Brazil in the early 1970s. Besides his writing, he runs occasional writers' workshops and directs plays. He frequently teaches writing and literature courses at Southern Virginia University.\n\nHe is the author many sci-fi and fantasy novels, including the American frontier fantasy series \"The Tales of Alvin Maker\" (beginning with Seventh Son), as well as stand-alone science fiction and fantasy novels like Pastwatch and Hart's Hope. He has collaborated with his daughter Emily Card on a manga series, Laddertop. He has also written contemporary thrillers like Empire and historical novels like the monumental Saints and the religious novels Sarah and Rachel and Leah. Card's recent work includes the Mithermages books (Lost Gate, Gate Thief), contemporary magical fantasy for readers both young and old.\n\nCard lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his wife, Kristine Allen Card. He and Kristine are the parents of five children and several grandchildren.\n\nTitle: The Shadow Quintet : Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant, and Shadows in Flight\n\nAuthor(s): Orson Scott Card\n\nISBN: 9780765376831\n\nCopyright 2013\n\nRelease Date: September 24, 2013\n\nPublisher: Tor Publishing Group\n\nCountries: United States, Canada | Learn more about available countries\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFormat: mobi,ePub | Learn More about our supported formats\n\nDragonmount is a proud provider of DRM-free eBooks.
