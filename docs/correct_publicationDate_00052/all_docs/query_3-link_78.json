        "text": "“Ender’s Game” by Orson Scott Card is one of those books that falls along the lines of “an oldie but a goodie.” The book is fantastic, startling, and heartbreaking all at the same time.\n\nThe story takes place some time in the future, but the exact time is unknown. “Ender’s Game” chronicles the life of the young boy Andrew “Ender” Wiggin.\n\nIn this two-child society future, having a third child and being that third child, who is referred to as a “Third,” is frowned upon. Ender just so happens to be a Third.\n\nAt home, he is tortured by his cruel older brother, Peter, and protected by his overly-loving sister, Valentine.\n\nIn the book, the Earth has survived two alien attacks from a species nicknamed “buggers.” Many think there will be a third invasion, so they take necessary precautions and build a massive army filled with skilled professionals and geniuses.\n\nThere is one surprising aspect to this army. They consist of children in the age range of six to twelve years old. The concept seems crazy, but it’s just crazy enough to actually work.\n\nThese children are taken from their homes and trained in battle school with the rest of this child army. The government looks for specific kids in an attempt to breed geniuses. Ender Wiggin is among these genius kids.\n\nOver the course of approximately five years, the reader accompanies Ender as he discovers how to deal with bullies in battle school, lead his own battle team, and eventually live up to his full potential.\n\nIf you are looking for a futuristic book that throws you major curveballs, then this is the right book for you. Even though it was written in 1985, I recommend it considering how well it was written. Read it fast so you can see the big-screen adaptation coming out on November 1st."
