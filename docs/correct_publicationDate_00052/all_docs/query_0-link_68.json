        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author Orson Scott Card!\n\nOrson Scott Card is the author of the widely read novels Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, and Speaker for the Dead. Devoured by adults and younger readers alike, the acclaimed novels are increasingly used in schools.\n\nHe has recently released the novel Wakers, the first novel of a brand new series that follows a teen who wakes up on an abandoned Earth to discover that hes a clone. Laz finds himself surrounded by hundreds of other clones, all dead, and quickly realizes that he too must be a clone of his original self. Laz has no idea what happened to the world he remembers as vibrant and bustling only yesterday, and he struggles to survive in the barren wasteland hes now trapped in. But the question that haunts him isnt why was he created, but instead, who woke him up and why?\n\nIn addition to this and other science fiction novels such as his young adult Pathfinder series (Pathfinder, Ruins, Visitors), Card writes contemporary fantasy (the Mithermages series, Magic Street, Enchantment, Lost Boys), biblical novels (Stone Tables, Rachel and Leah), the American frontier fantasy series The Tales of Alvin Maker (beginning with Seventh Son), poetry (An Open Book), and many plays and scripts, including his \"freshened\" Shakespeare scripts for Romeo & Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Merchant of Venice.\n\nCard was born in Washington and grew up in California, Arizona, and Utah. He served a mission for the LDS Church in Brazil in the early 1970s. Besides his writing, he teaches occasional classes and workshops and directs plays. He frequently teaches writing and literature courses at Southern Virginia University.\n\nCard currently lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his wife, Kristine Allen Card, where he remains an avid watcher and critic of film and television, as well as books and music.\n\nYou can find a signed copy of Wakers as well as a collection of other Orson Scott Card signed books below.\n\nOrson Scott Card Book List and Awards\n\nHis website: www.hatrack.com\n\nSimilar authors: Kevin J.
