According to Card he used a pseudonym for \"Gert Fram\" because he already had three other works appearing in the same issue. He used the penname Byron Walley again in various other publications for LDS magazines such as the Friend and the New Era as well as the short story \"Middle Woman\" in Dragons of Darkness.[23] Card used the names Frederick Bliss and P.Q. Gump when he wrote an overview of Mormon playwrights for the Spring 1976 issue of Sunstone magazine. According to Card he used these pseudonyms because the article included a brief reference to himself and his play \"Stone Tables\".[23] He used the name Brian Green in the July 1977 fine arts issue of Ensign magazine. He used this name for his short play \"The Rag Mission\" because he had three other pieces appearing in the same issue.[23] Card used the name Noam D. Pellume for his short story \"Damn Fine Novel\" which appeared in the October 1989 issue of The Green Pages.[24]"
