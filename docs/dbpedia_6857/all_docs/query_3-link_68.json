        "text": "My mother has early onset Alzheimer’s. She received this diagnosis several years ago, when there were already signs of cognitive decline. Had I read the ‘Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer’s Disease’ inset in our textbook back then (Benokraitis 2015:470), I would have recognised those signs — e.g., memory loss and disorientation as to time and place — for what they were, instead of reacting so peevishly to what I took to be something that she could control. In any event, some months after her diagnosis she called me up and explained that she wanted me to have powers of attorney over her affairs; she foresaw then that a time would come when she could no longer run her own life. In the years since I’ve taken up this responsibility, I’ve found that it requires a delicate balancing act between doing what she can’t do for herself, on the one hand, and trying not to strip away all her feelings of agency, on the other (e.g., controlling her access to her own life’s savings).\n\nI haven’t always gotten this balance right — far from it, in fact: I’m often too quick to patronise her, or to dismiss her pleas for more control. And this is a dilemma that’s well portrayed in Ran: I think of the conflict between Hidetora and Taro, which occurs fairly early on (so no real spoilers there) over the right of the former to retain his personal retinue within the castle walls, along with the insignia and title of ‘Great Lord’. We can see that stripping these things away would be to strip Hidetora not only of the trappings of his success and station, but of his very identity; they are the markers of a long, bloody climb to the top. But we can also readily understand Taro’s concerns and desire to assert his own authority, to be his own man. So this is one example of the way in which Ran dramatises the issues facing families in later life — among them depression and dementia among the elderly, caregiving of elderly relatives, caregiving styles, sibling relationships in later life, generational transitions— in a way that adds flesh to what would otherwise be an awfully dry textbook recitation of facts and figures.\n\n(Another classic dramatization of these issues is of course Shakespeare’s King Lear, which grew into one of Kurosawa’s most important source materials about a year or two after he had begun work on the screenplay for Ran back in the seventies. I was surprised to read — I no longer remember the source — that it was not the original inspiration.)\n\nBut of course, even though Kurosawa deals with these topics brilliantly, he’s also asking the most profound questions any human being can ask. What do parents owe to their children, and what do children owe to their parents? How do we balance the obligations and responsibilities of family with all our other needs, desires, and ambitions? What do we owe to each other in general? And finally, what sense are we to make of a world that is so often cruel and unjust? Ran suggests answers to all of these questions — although as with any great work of art, understanding these answers takes a great deal of excavation and interpretation, and deciding whether we agree with the magisterial director can be a lifelong work of reflection.\n\nYou will see, then, that Kurosawa is a masterful storyteller; but the video essay below is very helpful in terms of understanding and appreciating some of the things that Akira Kurosawa does as a filmmaker. Bonus insights for you if you’re a fan of the Marvel Avengers franchise. Note: There are some visual spoilers in the essay, however, so you shouldn’t watch this until you’ve seen the whole film.\n\nFurther Reading/Notes Toward a Personal Canon\n\nDebussy, Claude.

In this podcast, Hughey discusses his analysis of ‘white saviour’ films — a bit removed from our main concerns, but here you can get a sense of how a sociologist might approach the study of film, as opposed to, say, a film critic or a film historian.\n\nKing Lear. 1973.
