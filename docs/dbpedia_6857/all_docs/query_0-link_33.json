        "text": "Love him or hate him, there’s no denying that the Bard of Avon has left an indelible imprint on fiction ever since he put quill to parchment. While I don’t know how it’s possible not to enjoy the works of Bill Shakespeare, I do accept the fact that he has his fair share of detractors, even by those I respect intellectually. Like I said though, I’m a big fan and have been ever since I saw the Mel Gibson film production of Hamlet in middle school (a production I ironically don’t think is all that great these days). My favorite play by Shakespeare though is King Lear. There’s something about its immense darkness, mixed against an epic family drama with perhaps the greatest villain Shakespeare ever wrote, that makes for a play that I can read again and again and again and always find some new passage or scene that’s infused with immense meaning.\n\nThe wonderful thing about Shakespeare’s plays is that they are so timeless and universal in their themes that they can be freely adapted as new artists and visionaries see fit. West Side Story, Baz Luhrman’s modern take on Romeo and Juliet, the Ethan Hawke Hamlet, Mekhi Phieffer’s O. It’s a terrible film but even 10 Things I Hate About You is an adaptation of Taming of the Shrew. You can change the era, the setting, and even some characters, but his stories still shine through and still make for entertaining escapes to this day. Akira Kurosawa is the premier auteur of Japanese film-making and no one from those tiny islands has come close to dethroning him. Rashomon, Yojimbo, and Seven Samurai still stand as some of the most famous films in the history of foreign cinema. I just finished his adaptation of King Lear, his magnum opus, Ran (which is Japanese for Chaos). It is now the single best foreign language film I’ve reviewed for this blog. Sorry, Fellini.\n\nRan, as I said, is a semi-loose adaptation of King Lear. Set in feudal Japan, Ran follows the demise of the once-powerful Ichimonji clan. The head of the clan and leader of Japan, is the now old and sickly Hidetora. After gathering his three children together (and his advisors), Hidetora announces that he is ceding his authority to the throne, and leaving his eldest son, Taro, in charge of the nation. He also leaves a castle and land to his middle child, Jiro. His youngest son, Subaro, was supposed to inherit land and a castle as well, but he spoke honestly and bluntly to his father about the dangers of dividing the land this way and the impending destruction. For his honesty, Hidetora banishes Subaro. At the behest of his Lady Macbeth wife, Kaede, Taro eventually banishes his father from the castle and Jiro quickly follows suit. Eventually fratricide and all out war breaks out in the kingdom as brother turns against brother and Hidetora descends into total madness.\n\nThe cinematography in this film is beyond breathtaking. Much like Fellini, Kurosawa is one of the undisputed masters of visual artistry in his films, and this film puts his particular skill set on display like no other picture. Whether its the use of color during the beautifully orchestrated battles or simply the masters use of background and location shoots, nearly every scene in the film is full of the kind of visual grandeur that most directors are lucky to capture in their best scene in their best films. For a film full of such artistry and beauty, it’s astonishing how horrifying and and barbaric the battle sequences are. Even though the blood looks suspiciously like red paint, it doesn’t change just how intense every single fight was. All of Kurosawa’s experience with historical epics came into play during each of the exquisitely choreographed battles.\n\nIn the original play, Edmund stood out as one of the best villains that has ever been written. He is so perfectly manipulative and ambitious that despite being a lowborn son of bastard birth, he nearly centralizes all of the power of England around himself. Ran flips around the genders of most of the major players of the play, and Edmund becomes Lady Kaede. She is definitely one of the best female villains in the history of cinema. When she coldly asks for the head of Jiro’s previous wife and insists that it is properly salted, you know she has more ice in her veins than any of the men in the film. The Fool in King Lear also distinguished himself as one of Shakespeare’s more cleverly written supporting characters, and Hidetora’s androgynous fool, Kyoami, steals every second that he’s on screen. It is actually the scenes between Kyoami and Hidetora that I felt Kurosawa was most completely channeling the style and power of Shakespeare.\n\nYou need to watch this movie. There are no if’s, and’s, or but’s about this. It combines the best of the historical epic genre with the visual artistry of one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema with one of the greatest tragedies ever written. It’s samurais meets Shakespeare. I’m not really sure how you can possibly go wrong there. I think this was my 95th movie for this blog. This is going to be one of only 5 movies to get the score that I’m about to bestow on it, so that should hopefully speak leagues about its quality. The only person that I can’t recommend this to are those who can’t sit through foreign films with subtitles, but then, you probably aren’t into good movies in the first place as it is. So, rent this movie from where ever you rent movies from. You need to do it right now.\n\nFinal Score: A+"
