Akira Kurosawa took the story and remade it into this highly regarded, blood splattered 'Period of the Warring States' epic.\n\nAfter years of ruthless slaughter, Hidetero splits his kingdom amongst his sons seeking a peaceful retirement, but his life descends into chaos as he is unable to escape the corruption within his own family and the torment within his soul."
