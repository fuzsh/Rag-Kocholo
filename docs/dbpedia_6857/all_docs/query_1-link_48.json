        "text": "Akira Kurosawa's widely acclaimed film ''Ran'' will not be nominated for an Academy Award as Best Foreign Film, and the story of how it came to be left out is one of good intentions and missed opportunities.\n\nThe case is especially poignant because the film, which tells the King Lear-like story of an arrogant and cruel feudal lord driven mad by the betrayal of two his three sons, has won high critical praise. Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, called the work ''a film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation.' ''\n\nAt the heart of the problem was the international effort that went into the making of the film. Mr. Kurosawa, considered a maverick in the Japanese film-making world, has long sought money from outside Japan to help finance his films.\n\nFor ''Ran,'' he turned to Serge Silberman, the producer of such films as ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' whose Greenwich Film Company is based in Paris. Mr. Kurosawa also lined up a Japanese co-producer and distributor, Nippon Herald Ace of Tokyo.\n\nWhen the time came to submit the film for an Academy Award nomination, it appears that the film's producers did not fully understand the ground rules by which foreign films may be considered.\n\nOne Film From a Country\n\nUnder the current procedure, foreign countries may each submit one film to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be considered for nomination as Best Foreign Film. The countries select their nominee by various methods. In Japan, for example, the choice is made by the Japan Movie Producers Association, an organization of the five major Japanese film production companies, which solicits applications from Japanese producers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
