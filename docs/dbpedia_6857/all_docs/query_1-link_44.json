        "text": "''Ran'' was shown as part of this year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared Sept. 27 in The New York Times. The film opens today at Cinema 1, Third Avenue at 60th Street.\n\nAKIRA KUROSAWA'S ''Ran'' (''Chaos'') is a film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' ''Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance'' and Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible.'' Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ''Ran'' has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\n\nKurosawa resists the description of ''Ran'' as his ''version'' of ''King Lear,'' in the manner of his free, 1957 adaptation of ''Macbeth,'' titled ''Throne of Blood.'' However, he won't have an easy time disentangling his film from Shakespeare.\n\nKurosawa's ''Lear'' is Hidetora, the head of the Ichimonji clan, a once ruthless, now exhausted warlord who has spent his entire life subjugating his rivals and consolidating a vast dominion that he now, at the age of 70, wants to turn over to his three sons, on whose kindness he depends. Taro and Jiro, the two older sons, both ambitious, agree to their father's terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. When Saburo, the youngest son, points out that by so dividing the lands, Hidetora is setting up conditions that will inevitably lead to disaster, the furious father sends Saburo into exile."
