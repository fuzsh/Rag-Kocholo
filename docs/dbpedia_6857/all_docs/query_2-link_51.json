        "text": "Shōgun has always been difficult for me to sit back and enjoy. For many people in the generation before me, this tome of a novel published by James Clavell in 1975, was their introduction to Japan and the world of samurai. By the time I learned of its existence, I had a few years of study under my belt and struggled the separate history from fiction. I only ever watched the 1980 miniseries starring Richard Chamberland and Toshiro Mifune for a paper in college, and even then, it was too long, and I struggled to finish it. I’ve grown since then, mainly because I’ve walked the same path of writing a historical fiction novel. I know how difficult it can be to start out, writing down every bit of information learned from the hours of research, only to realize that it’s starting to read like a historical narrative. The fight to keep it 100% historically accurate put blinders on my creativity and stilted my writing. It was only after taking a few writing classes that I realized that no historical fiction book is ever going to be that accurate. No one has a glass ball to gaze back into the past and write down every word and every event as it happened. As an author, you’re going to take some liberties because it’s your own story. It’s your own perspective on the events. Since I allowed myself that grace with my own work, I thought I would try to do my best to keep this in mind with the reboot of Shōgun. This is Clavell’s interpretation of the events that led up to the Battle of Sekigahara, coming from his own unique perspective and life experience. Books, like art, are subjective. Not everyone is going to like it.\n\nYet, it’s so hard to shut out my historical knowledge. While I understand that this is a work of fiction, because I know who their historical counterparts are, I can’t help to point out the obvious wrongs. Sugiyama (Maeda Toshiie) is on the Council of Regents, but historically, he would’ve been dead for about a year around the time the novel begins. Ohno Harunobu (Ōtani Yoshitsugu) apparently converted to Christianity, yet I’ve only found one claim regarding this on Japanese Wikipedia and even then, it’s a stretch. Ohno, along with Kiyama ukon Sadanaga (Konishi Yukinaga), are on this same Council, yet historically, they were just supporters of Ishida Mitsunari and sat on neither of the two councils that were created by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. And, let’s face it, the real Mitsunari wishes he had the power and influence his Shōgun counterpart has. The problem is that understanding this era is a blessing and a curse. While it does help to figure out the historical counterpart to make sense of things in your head, it deviates from history just as much to create its own world, making it difficult to use history as a guide. People who have no knowledge of the history might be alright but be forewarned: keeping up with the names will be difficult.\n\nOne thing that bothered me about this reboot before it even began was the comparisons to Game of Thrones. While the HBO series was popular for a time, tacking this onto the title of reviews from critics makes me want to throw my computer in the trash.\n\nWe’ve already gotten this comparison once regarding Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan and we all remember how that went down. It’s also feudal Japan, so of course it’s going to have the same elements that made George R.R. Martin’s series popular, because newsflash, his Song of Ice and Fire is based off a very similar time in England. Feudalism will always make for exciting stories with complicated political systems and deep world building. And war. Don’t forget war.\n\nI also understand that the comparison to Game of Thrones was done to bring in viewers who normally wouldn’t watch something like Shōgun. This, however, drums up an image of what audiences should also expect from the show, such as cursing, violence and sex. While violence is an obvious one (I mean, it’s war after all), and I’m not naïve enough to believe that none of these men, foreign or Japanese, never cursed (although probably not the same ones we’d use today), the sex is the one I take most issue with. I made this statement before when talking about Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan: I’m no prude by any means, but why do we have these scenes? It’s definitely not for shock factor anymore because it’s in every mature television show and film. I get “sex sells”, but audiences have come to expect it and frankly, they’re not needed. We’re treated to one in the first episode and it’s so out of the blue that if it was removed, it would not affect the story all that much. Maybe it comes into play later, I don’t know, but rarely do these scenes add anything to a story. Considering how past comparisons fared and the image it conjured up in my mind, the Game of Thrones tag on reviews is the equivalent of comparing every extremely difficult video game to Dark Souls. We get it. You like something. Move on.\n\nWith those rants aside, I thought I would talk about my initial thoughts regarding the reboot. The biggest praise for Shōgun has been its visuals. I think Godzilla Minus One ruined me for I have not found the visuals for this to be all that spectacular. It’s CGI, and it’s rather obvious too. I know this was done to help the audience gain an understanding of what Japan looked like in 1600 (which is nice for us history people trying to visualize castle towns for research), but it was rather obvious at times that it was computer generated. Adding onto that, it was dark. This isn’t just Shōgun, for a lot of Hollywood’s television shows and films have taken on darker color palettes recently and it just makes it gloomy viewing. I know this isn’t supposed to be a happy time in Japanese history, but Japan is a beautiful country. Why mute it with such a lack of color and dark tones? This is more of just a complaint about how things are being produced in Hollywood today more than a critique on Shōgun itself, so take it what you will.\n\nThere were a few things that stuck out to me while watching the first two episodes. One was the more modern dialogue. I get why this was done and honestly, it’s not a complaint. If we tried to make every historical fiction piece sound like the era it takes place in, it would be rather difficult for modern audiences to understand. Updating the language helps keep the story relevant throughout the ages. Yet, there’s one area that I think it could’ve been improved upon, and that’s the Catholic/Protestant language. While it’s a small complaint, it has different connotations in 21st century America than it did in 1600 Europe. Mainly, both saw each other as being the true church and the other as heretics or corruptors. These terms are more modern than the era the story takes place and I think it could’ve been worked out a bit differently, but for the purposes of the story, it works.\n\nI may not be a prolific as other Japanese history content creators out there on identifying period correct clothing and armor, but I do have an eye for different types of guns, and I noticed an interesting little problem. Though it was rather blurred in the scene where Rodriguez pulls the pistol on Blackthorne, it looked rather different than the guns that would’ve been available at the time. Adding more insult to injury, the character promotional poster of Blackthorne (and in the official trailer) show him with two pistols that are outside of the era. They’re flintlocks and they’re about thirty years too early. While their origins don’t have an exact date, most agree that they came from France sometime in the early 17th century. While they were around for a time, their popularity didn’t really spike until decades later in the 1630s. Just a little too late for Rodriguez and Blackthorne to be toting them around like Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nI’ll end this on a high note, for the casting couldn’t have been better. Sanada Hiroyuki is great as Toranaga and Néstor Carbonell is fantastic as Rodriguez. Hira Takahiro, who many might recognize as Shima Sakon from 2017’s Sekigahara, makes a convincing and detestable Ishido Kazunari. Though so far, the interaction has been brief, the tense exchange between Mariko and her husband, Toda Buntaro, was perfect.\n\nThough it may seem like I had some complaints, I understand that this is just the beginning of the series and some of my reservations could disappear by the end of it. I’m fighting the urge to write an article about the things Shōgun gets wrong historically, because, let’s face it, people have already done this and I’m trying to be a bit more compassionate to a work I never really liked. After going through the writing journey myself, I understand. I can’t wait to see how the rest of the series plays out and will write a full review when the series ends in April 2024.\n\nSpecial thanks to my Dad for helping me out with identifying the guns used in the show thus far. He builds muzzleloaders as his retirement hobby and knows a thing or two about the history of firearms. It’s always fun when our passions come together for a short time even though they’re worlds apart. Thank you, Dad."
