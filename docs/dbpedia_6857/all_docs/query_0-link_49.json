King Lear's counterpart is an elderly 16th-century warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai), who announces that he's about to divide his kingdom equally among his three sons. In his dotage, he falls prey to the false flattery of his treacherous sons (Akira Terao and Jinpachi Nezu), while banishing his youngest son (Daisuke Ryu), the only member of the family who loves him enough to tell him the unvarnished truth. Deftly employing all of the techniques associated with his long career, Kurosawa creates a powerful portrayal of a kingdom coming apart at the seams. Ran is a masterwork of one of the world's great directors.\n\nDVD - The Criterion Collection\n\nNew, restored high-definition digital transfer\n\nWidescreen\n\nCommentary by film historian Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa\n\nAudio commentary by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince\n\nAn appreciation of the film by director Sidney Lumet\n\n\"A.K.,\" a 74-minute making-of film by director Chris Marker\n\n\"Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create,\" a 37-minute documentary\n\n\"Image: Kurosawa's Continuity,\" a 35-minute video piece\n\nNew video interview with actor Tatsuya Nakadai\n\nOriginal theatrical trailer\n\nNew essay by film critic Michael Wilmington\n\nNew and improved English subtitle translation\n\nCurator's Comments:\n\nRoger Ebert's essay on this DVD Classic.\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nColor\n\n160 minutes\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nRated: R\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nLanguage: Japanese with English subtitles\n\nGenre: Drama/War\n\nlibrary pricing and ordering"
