        "text": "IT would be difficult to imagine a more appropriate way to open the 23d New York Film Festival than with the two showings, which are scheduled for tonight at Lincoln Center, of Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran'' (''Chaos''), a film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' ''Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance'' and Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible.''\n\nThough big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ''Ran'' has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\n\nKurosawa resists the description of ''Ran'' as his ''version'' of ''King Lear,'' in the manner of his free, 1957 adaptation of ''Macbeth,'' titled ''Throne of Blood.'' However, he won't have an easy time disentangling his film from Shakespeare.\n\nAccording to Kurosawa, ''Ran'' had its initial inspiration in the true story of a 16th-century Japanese warlord, which, as he worked on it, became increasingly associated in his imagination with the titanic fall of Shakespeare's Lear. There certainly are major differences between ''Lear'' and ''Ran,'' but there also are enough parallels to prompt comparisons, which may not always be illuminating. ''Ran,'' at least as read in the English subtitles that translate the Japanese dialogue, is not a piece of dramatic literature. It's a visual masterwork whose manners, which sometimes look old-fashioned, recall virtually the entire history of epic cinema.\n\nKurosawa's ''Lear'' is Hidetora, the head of the Ichimonji clan, a once-ruthless, now-exhausted warlord who has spent his entire life subjugating his rivals and consolidating a vast dominion that he now, at the age of 70, wants to turn over to his three sons, on whose kindness he depends. Taro and Jiro, the two older sons, both ambitious, agree to their father's terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. When Saburo, the youngest son, points out that by so dividing the lands, Hidetora is setting up conditions that will inevitably lead to disaster, the furious father sends Saburo into exile.\n\nUnlike ''Kagemusha,'' Kurosawa's rather difficult-to-follow 1980 film, which the director has called a ''dry run'' for the more elaborate and expensive ''Ran,'' the politics and relationships in the new film are, though complex, always comprehensible. As in ''King Lear,'' what, under other, far more ordinary conditions, would simply be a family squabble becomes a meditation on the human condition.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
