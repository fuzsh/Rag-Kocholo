        "text": "Noun\n\nThe name of something, like a person, animal, place, thing, or concept. Nouns are typically used as subjects, objects, objects of prepositions, and modifiers of other nouns.\n\nI finished the study.\n\nI = subject\n\nMaggie wrote the dissertation.\n\nthe dissertation = object\n\nThe author presented the results in Chapter 4.\n\nin Chapter 4 = object of a preposition\n\nHis research findings can contribute to social change.\n\nresearch = modifier\n\nVerb\n\nThis expresses what the person, animal, place, thing, or concept does. In English, verbs follow the noun.\n\nIt takes a good deal of dedication to complete a doctoral degree.\n\nShe studied hard for the test.\n\nWriting a dissertation is difficult. (The \"be\" verb is also sometimes referred to as a copula or a linking verb. It links the subject, in this case \"writing a dissertation,\" to the complement or the predicate of the sentence, in this case, \"hard.\")\n\nAdjective\n\nThis describes a noun or pronoun. Adjectives typically come before a noun or after a stative verb, like the verb \"to be.\"\n\nThe diligent student completed her assignment early.\n\nDiligent describes the student and appears before the noun student.\n\nIt can be difficult to balance time to study and work responsibilities.\n\nDifficult is placed after the to be verb and describes what it is like to balance time.\n\nRemember that adjectives in English have no plural form. The same form of the adjective is used for both singular and plural nouns.\n\nA different idea\n\nSome different ideas\n\nINCORRECT: some differents ideas\n\nAdverb\n\nThis gives more information about the verb and about how the action was done. Adverbs tells how, where, when, why, etc. Depending on the context, the adverb can come before or after the verb or at the beginning or end of a sentence.\n\nHe completed the course enthusiastically.\n\nEnthusiastically describes how he completed the course and answers the how question.\n\nSteven recently enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Communication program at Walden.\n\nRecently modifies the verb enroll and answers the when question.\n\nThen, I verified that most of my sources were peer-reviewed.\n\nThen describes and modifies the entire sentence. See this link on transitions for more examples of conjunctive adverbs (adverbs that join one idea to another to improve the cohesion of the writing).\n\nPronoun\n\nThis word substitutes for a noun or a noun phrase (e.g. it, she, he, they, that, those,…).\n\nSmith (2014) interviewed the applicants as they arrived.\n\nthey = applicants\n\nHe was interested in ideas that were never previously recorded, not those that have already been published.\n\nHe = Smith; that = ideas; those = those ideas\n\nDeterminer\n\nThis word makes the reference of the noun more specific (e.g. his, her, my, their, the, a, an, this, these,…).\n\nJones published her book in 2015.\n\nThe book was very popular.\n\nPreposition\n\nThis comes before a noun or a noun phrase and links it to other parts of the sentence. These are usually single words (e.g., on, at, by,…) but can be up to four words (e.g., as far as, in addition to, as a result of, …).\n\nI chose to interview teachers in the district closest to me.\n\nThe recorder was placed next to the interviewee.\n\nI stopped the recording in the middle of the interview due to a low battery.\n\nConjunction\n\nA word that joins two clauses. These can be coordinating (an easy way to remember this is memorizing FANBOYS = for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or subordinating (e.g., because, although, when, …).\n\nThe results were not significant, so the alternative hypothesis was accepted.\n\nAlthough the results seem promising, more research must be conducted in this area.\n\nAuxiliary Verbs\n\nHelping verbs. They are used to build up complete verbs.\n\nPrimary auxiliary verbs (be, have, do) show the progressive, passive, perfect, and negative verb tenses.\n\nModal auxiliary verbs (can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would) show a variety of meanings. They represent ability, permission, necessity, and degree of certainty. These are always followed by the simple form of the verb.\n\nSemimodal auxiliary verbs (e.g., be going to, ought to, have to, had better, used to, be able to,…). These are always followed by the simple form of the verb.\n\nResearchers have investigated this issue for some time. However, the cause of the problem has not been determined.\n\nprimary: have investigated = present perfect tense; has not been determined = passive, perfect, negative form\n\nHe could conduct more research, which may lead to the answer.\n\nThe modal could shows ability, and the verb conduct stays in its simple form; the modal may shows degree of certainty, and the verb lead stays in its simple form.\n\nFuture researchers are going to delve more into this topic. They are about to make a breakthrough discovery.\n\nThese semimodals are followed by the simple form of the verb.\n\nOrder of Adjectives\n\nIf more than one adjective is used in a sentence, they tend to occur in a certain order. In English, two or three adjectives modifying a noun tend to be the limit. However, when writing in APA, not many adjectives should be used (since APA is objective, scientific writing). If adjectives are used, the framework below can be used as guidance in adjective placement.\n\nDeterminer (e.g., this, that, these, those, my, mine, your, yours, him, his, hers they, their, some, our, several,…) or article (a, an, the)\n\nOpinion, quality, or observation adjective (e.g., lovely, useful, cute, difficult, comfortable)\n\nPhysical description\n\n(a) size (big, little, tall, short)\n\n(b) shape (circular, irregular, triangular)\n\n(c) age (old, new, young, adolescent)\n\n(d) color (red, green, yellow)\n\nOrigin (e.g., English, Mexican, Japanese)\n\nMaterial (e.g., cotton, metal, plastic)\n\nQualifier (noun used as an adjective to modify the noun that follows; i.e., campus activities, rocking chair, business suit)\n\nHead noun that the adjectives are describing (e.g., activities, chair, suit)\n\nFor example:\n\nThis (1) lovely (2) new (3) wooden (4) Italian (5) rocking (6) chair (7) is in my office.\n\nYour (1) beautiful (2) green (3) French (4) silk (5) business (6) suit (7) has a hole in it.\n\nCommas With Multiple Adjectives\n\nA comma is used between two adjectives only if the adjectives belong to the same category (for example, if there are two adjectives describing color or two adjectives describing material). To test this, ask these two questions:\n\nDoes the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written in reverse order?\n\nDoes the sentence make sense if the word “and” is written between them?\n\nIf the answer is yes to the above questions, the adjectives are separated with a comma. Also keep in mind a comma is never used before the noun that it modifies.\n\nThis useful big round old green English leather rocking chair is comfortable. (Note that there are no commas here because there is only one adjective from each category.)\n\nA lovely large yellow, red, and green oil painting was hung on the wall. (Note the commas between yellow, red, and green since these are all in the same category of color.)\n\nPosition of Adverbs\n\nAdverbs can appear in different positions in a sentence.\n\nAt the beginning of a sentence: Generally, teachers work more than 40 hours a week.\n\nAfter the subject, before the verb: Teachers generally work more than 40 hours a week.\n\nAt the end of a sentence: Teachers work more than 40 hours a week, generally.\n\nHowever, an adverb is not placed between a verb and a direct object. INCORRECT: Teachers work generally more than 40 hours a week.\n\nMore Detailed Rules for the Position of Adverbs\n\nAdverbs that modify the whole sentence can move to different positions, such as certainly, recently, fortunately, actually, and obviously.\n\nRecently, I started a new job.\n\nI recently started a new job.\n\nI started a new job recently.\n\nMany adverbs of frequency modify the entire sentence and not just the verb, such as frequently, usually, always, sometimes, often, and seldom. These adverbs appear in the middle of the sentence, after the subject.\n\nShe frequently gets time to herself. (The adverb appears before the main verb.)\n\nINCORRECT: Frequently she gets time to herself.\n\nINCORRECT: She gets time to herself frequently.\n\nShe has frequently exercised during her lunch hour. (The adverb appears after the first auxiliary verb.)\n\nShe is frequently hanging out with old friends. (The adverb appears after the to be verb.)\n\nAdverbial phrases work best at the end of a sentence.\n\nHe greeted us in a very friendly way.\n\nI collected data for 2 months."
