        "text": "Akira Kurosawa stands as one of the most important film makers of the 20th century. A master of his own medium, Kurosawa’s powerful composition serves to inspire many artists and film makers internationally. The Magnificent Seven is a remake of Seven Samurai, A Fistful of Dollars is a remake of Yojimbo (which Kurosawa successfully argued in a lawsuit against the film), even American pop culture landmark, Star Wars, drew influence from his 1958 film The Hidden Fortress after George Lucas attended a screening in film school. Akira Kurosawa’s influence on film as an art form is undeniable and ever growing as more artists discover his volume of work. With his influence so wide reaching, one could wonder where Kurosawa himself finds inspiration. Just as many of his films have transcended cultural barriers, Kurosawa’s own interests reflect this vision. Arguably Kurosawa’s greatest epic, Ran, finds power in its synthesis of 14th century Japanese Noh drama and William Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of King Lear.\n\nRan captures the structure of King Lear and reconstructs a new vision of the narrative set in feudal era Japan. Hidetora, representing Lear, moves to divide his kingdom among his three sons. The eldest son Taro, the second son Jiro, and the youngest son Saburo, they represent and align extremely close with Lear’s daughters being Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia respectively. Whereas Lear motions for a display of love from his daughters, Kurosawa draws on Mōri Motonari’s parable of three arrows, Hidetora asks on his sons for a display of strength and unity within each other. Unlike Motonari’s parable, perhaps in a reflection of Kurosawa’s own ever growing, cynical perspective of life, Saburo breaks the arrows upon his knee, showing what he perceives as the weakness of the lesson and disrespecting Hidetora’s wisdom in the process; leading to his exile like Cordelia’s in turn. This leads to catalyze the events of the film, mirroring that of the play with Taro’s wife, Lady Kaede, representing Edmund.\n\nKurosawa finds strength in his allusion to King Lear in the destruction of Hidetora’s character who mirrors Lear’s own demise. As Jiro’s and Taro’s armies clash in battle and Hidetora marches out of his castle, now in flames, having not been able to commit harakiri (a Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment), he joins the storm as Lear. In his piece The Bow is Bent and Drawn: Kurosawa’s Ran and the Shakespearean Arrow of Desire Samuel Crowl describes this moment. “Hidetora’s rage in the storm has been triggered by the battle just fought between Taro and Jiro’s forces. He wanders through the carnage of the savage battle shouting ‘I am a messenger from heaven. This is heaven’s war. Smash the rebels . . . have no mercy. This is heaven’s punishment. Come on, I will give you a taste of destruction.’ This is Kurosawa’s vision of Lear’s desire for the ‘all shaking thunder’ to ‘strike flat the thick rotundity of the world . . . that makes ungrateful man.” This imagery of Hidetora cursing heaven or nature for war brought on by his sons reinforces the comparison made to Lear’s calls to the storm in Act 3 scene 2. Hidetora’s outlook reflects the moment in which Leer’s challenge to the storm becomes resentful acceptance. I think to the line “Here I stand your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.” Hidetora is Leer in this moment. Literally marching away from his kingdom, made slave to the destruction brought by the wanton conquest his children wrought. The film is able to convey this state of infirmity through the framing of his departure. Hidetora does not rapidly flea, but slowly marches beyond his walls without direction; Completely defeated.\n\nHidetora’s or Lear’s descent is also portrayed physically through the use of makeup paying homage to Noh theatre. In the beginning of the film Tatsuya Nakadai, portraying Hidetora while in makeup allowing him to portray a character much older than he really is, there is a sense of vibrance to his visage paired with the bright colored outfits of the opening scenes. As the film progresses Nakadai begins to wear makeup giving the appearance of a traditional Noh mask which would represent a spirit, demon, or otherworldly creature. In his article, Kurosawa vs Shakespeare for the British Film Institute Ben Nicholson describes Kurosawa’s technique. “Kurosawa returns to the tension between western naturalism and Noh to express Hidetora’s spiral into madness. His makeup gradually thickens and becomes more stylized to recall the recall the recognizable motifs of the theatre as he is beset by peril and when he reaches his apparent nadir amid the incredible battle scene on the slopes of Mount Fuji . . . As he roams the wastelands in the driving wind and rain, he acts as a near perfect illustration of Kurosawa’s brilliantly cinematic relationship with Shakespeare” Kurosawa synthesizes Japanese tradition with Western storytelling further emphasizing the degradation of the self in the figure of Leer, through Hidetora. As Hidetora’s physically loses his humanity he begins to closer resemble a traditional Japanese spirit.\n\nOne could argue that Akira Kurosawa’s embrace of Western storytelling in the form of figures like Shakespeare could be attributed to the timeless longevity and international appeal of his films. The ability to synthesize one’s own culture with that of another allows for the creation of a new vision within the framework of a classic work. Kurosawa’s Ran as an interpretation of Shakespeare’s Tragedy of King Lear speaks to the timeless aspect and international love for Shakespeare’s work. The idea that work written some 400 years ago could be adapted in 1985 in a far off foreign nation, in a different language, without losing the intention of the production shows that Shakespeare’s work doesn’t speak to British struggles, or English struggles, but to universal Human struggles."
