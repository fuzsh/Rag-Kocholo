An account of confession and revenge set against the backdrop of a new democracy, emerging from a long period of dictatorship. A former political prisoner suffered at the hands of a captor whose face she never saw, but whose voice and mannerisms she recalls with terrifying clarity. Years later, and as if by fate, she acts as judge and jury to a man she believes to have been her oppressor. She struggles to find a form of reconciliation for the experience that she and others, have endured.
