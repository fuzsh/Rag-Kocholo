        "text": "Runnin' On E\n\nWith production on his next film delayed, Vince searches for ways to amuse himself. Andrew tells Ari he's ended his affair with a co-worker, but Ari has Lloyd keep an eye on him anyway. Drama auditions actresses to play his new love interest on 'Five Towns'; Jamie-Lynn takes Turtle shopping for back-to-school clothes; and a bored E contemplates his next move.\n\nGreenzo\n\nAs part of a GE-wide green initiative, Jack (Alec Baldwin) has come up with the idea of creating a green mascot for NBC -- a Philly Fanatic-looking character named Greenzo. When Greenzo's eco-friendly preachiness gets obnoxiously out of hand in The Girlie Show offices, it's Liz (Tina Fey) who gets fed up the most with this ridiculous character. Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) is planning his annual house party, a boring little soiree where Liz has been the only one who ever showed up in the past. Tracy (Tracy Morgan) wants the party to be a success for Kenneth, so he spreads a few little rumors to get the event hopping. What starts out as simple office gossip gets out of control. Also stars Jane Krakowski, Lonny Ross, Judah Friedlander, Scott Adsit, Katrina Bowden, and Maulik Pancholy. With special guest stars Meredith Vieira and David Schwimmer."
