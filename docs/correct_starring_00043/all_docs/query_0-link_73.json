        "text": "0713 john cusack in 2012.JPG\n\nJohn Cusack, in a scene from the action film '2012.'\n\n(Columbia Pictures)\n\nThe question for the spectacle-prone director Roland Emmerich (\"10,000 B.C.\") is simple: What now?\n\nSeemingly in constant competition with his own body of work, Hollywood's master of disaster blew up the White House in 1996's \"Independence Day.\" So in 2004's \"The Day After Tomorrow, \" he one-upped himself by inflicting a new Ice Age on Manhattan. Now, in his latest, \"2012\" -- a surprisingly sturdy apocalyptic thriller built on his trademark over-the-top, outsized effects sequences -- the whole planet gets Emmeriched.\n\nDown goes Vegas. Down goes St. Peter's Basilica. Down goes Los Angeles, sloughing off into the sea. Down goes the Washington Monument. Down goes the White House (again). Down goes 99 percent of humanity, either swallowed up, blown up or burned up.\n\nThere's a whole world of destruction going on in the film's jaw-dropping, eye-popping and ridiculously excessive special-effects sequences. But there's a whole lot of entertaining going on amid the relentless action, too, as \"2012, \" for all of its faults, ends up being relentlessly watchable as well, a summertime popcorn spectacle plopped down in the middle of the fall movie season.\n\nIt wouldn't take much effort to pick apart \"2012\" merely for the sake of doing so. There's the general Hollywood predictability. There's the graceless dialogue. There are the ham-handed emotional elements, in all their eye-rolling glory. Above all, however, is the rampant ridiculousness of it all, rooted as it is in shaky Hollywood pseudo-science.\n\nThe film is based on the fact that the Mayan calendar -- a remarkably advanced system, scientists agree -- appears to on Dec. 21, 2012. The only explanation, according to the hysteria-prone, is that the world will end on that date. It's a dubious conclusion -- ancient prophesies leave lots of room for interpretation -- but adherents have found what they say are corroborating prophesies in other ancient works.\n\nFor Emmerich's purposes, they're all correct, as scientists discover in \"2012.\" Specifically, they learn that solar super-radiation has separated the Earth's crust from the mantle, freeing the crust to rotate willy-nilly. North becomes south, south becomes north, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nAlong the way, \"2012\" becomes the mother of all disaster movies, with a little \"Poseidon Adventure\" here, a little \"Earthquake\" there, a dash of \"Airport, \" a whole lot of \"Towering Infernos.\"\n\nIn keeping with disaster movie convention, diverse characters find themselves thrown together and must combine their talents to survive. Chiwetel Ejiofor (\"Red Belt,\" \"Talk to Me\") is the scientist who first realizes what is happening. John Cusack (\"1408,\" \"The Martian Child\") is the divorced father of two who is desperate to escort his family to safety. Oliver Platt (\"Frost/Nixon,\" \"The Martian Child\") is the bureaucrat who wants to save his hide. And Woody Harrelson (\"Zombieland,\" \"Transsiberian\") is, as Platt puts it, one of \"the nutbags with the cardboard signs (who) had it right all the time.\"\n\nThe running time of \"2012\" is more than 2 1/2 hours, so the end might not be as nigh as impatient movie-goers might hope. As briskly paced as it is, however, it's a surprisingly fast-moving 21/2 hours.\n\nOf course, hell probably will freeze over before -- wait, \"hell will freeze over\" ... somebody get Roland Emmerich on the line.\n\n_______\n\n2012"
