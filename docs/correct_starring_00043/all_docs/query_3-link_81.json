        "text": "Thandie Newton made her West End debut last night in Ariel Dorfmans Death of the Maiden at the newly named Harold Pinter Theatre. The Jeremy Herrin directed-production, that was originally staged at The Royal Court in 1991, sees Bafta award-winning Newton play Paulina Salas, in the political thriller that runs until 21 January 2012.\n\nThandie stretches her thespian muscles as former political prisoner Paulina who, having suffered at the hands of her captor, seeks justice upon her release. The Crash actress stars alongside Tom Goodman-Hill and Anthony Calf in the staging that has been re-vamped 20 years after its world premiere  which gained Juliet Stevenson an Olivier award in 1991.\n\nFollowing the curtain call, Thandie, her parents (who described her performance as first class) and husband, producer Ol Parker partied at Haymarkets Mint Leaf restaurant  thought the leading lady made sure she wasnt out too late, as she would have to do it all again this evening.\n\nIsla Cunningham\n\nNext: Actress lights up BFI London Film Festival"
