        "text": "Camp Refoogee\n\nStan's determined to send a reluctant Steve to summer camp. The only one he finds is in Africa, and it's a refugee camp. Back in Langley Falls, Francine and Roger pretend to be a married couple at events around town, but they can't agree on their backstory.\n\nFreefall\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the harried staff struggles with a shortage of doctors. Abby treats an HIV-positive woman, Loren (Amy Pietz - \"Caroline in the City\"), who is hemorrhaging and may be pregnant. A horrifying accident very nearby threatens to engulf everyone in the hospital. Nearby, Lewis is unaware that her ex-husband, Chuck (recurring guest star Donal Logue), is involved in the flaming disaster. Meanwhile, Romano threatens to file a serious complaint against the brash Pratt and continues to taunt Abby with tough medical questions--even as she wonders what Carter might be doing that same day in Africa.\n\nMakemba\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the chilly emergency room staffers do their best to observe the holiday while a crusading Carter does the same--half a world away in a rundown Congolese medical clinic. Flashbacks reveal his relationship with Makemba \"Kem\" Likasu (recurring guest star Thandie Newton - \"Mission: Impossible 2\"), a beautiful African AIDS worker, as their clashes over meager resources slowly give way to a deep love affair. As Carter adjusts to the heat, filth and dangers of the region, he keeps in touch with his Chicago friends and embarks on a personal mission to help a pregnant mother who is dying of AIDS. Despite the anti-American sentiments of his French comrades, Carter remains determined to bring the joy and love of Christmas to the local children of Kisangani. Emmy Award-winning executive producer John Wells wrote the episode.\n\nGet Carter\n\nCarter makes the mistake of bringing his naÃ¯ve girlfriend, Kem (recurring guest star Thandie Newton), to observe the emergency room. Kem makes an impact--wanted or not--almost everywhere she wanders, ranging from an AIDS ward to the classroom and even in an unsanctioned ride with the paramedics. Pratt experiences a difficult night and questions his abilities as he treats a variety of patients, including a young boy who broke his back while sledding in the snow and an elderly man with fluid in his lung. Meanwhile, Gallant accompanies the paramedics and is nearly shot in a violent domestic dispute, during which he befriends a frightened boy. And Weaver dedicates a new center to Romano that has everyone talking.\n\nTouch and Go\n\nCarter returns to County General to hearty welcomes. Although Abby is shocked to learn that Carter's beautiful African girlfriend, Kem (recurring guest star Thandie Newton), is already pregnant with Carter's child, Abby has moved on with her life as well, going back to medical school. Meanwhile, Pratt's day starts off badly when Gallant finds out that Pratt has been having sex with Valerie (recurring guest star Joy Bryant), Gallant's attractive sister. Frustrated Pratt is repeatedly overruled on medical decisions until he heroically keeps an accident victim alive while a vital MRI is taken. But Pratt then rashly attempts to intubate the patient's son, who suffers from osteoporosis, and ends up breaking the young man's neck, permanently paralyzing him. Also, Kovac informs Weaver that he is quitting to return to Africa. And Sam feels like she neglects her young son, who is misbehaving in school."
