        "text": "OPENING TODAY\n\nOPENING TODAY\n\nJohn Carter\n\n(in 3-D, 2-D and Movies 16's XD)\n\nDirected by Andrew Stanton - who won Academy Awards for writing and directing \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Wall-E\" - this is a sweeping, action-filled adventure set on mysterious and exotic planet Barsoom (Mars). Based on the classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose imaginative stories inspired so many filmmakers, this film centers on John Carter (played by Taylor Kitsch), a war-weary, former Civil War military captain who becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands. Co-stars Dominic West, James Purefoy, Samantha Morton, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Bryan Cranston, Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Haden Church.\n\nRated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nSilent House\n\nAn unsettling horror film starring Elizabeth Olsen as Sarah, a young woman who finds herself sealed inside her family's secluded lake house. With no contact to the outside world, and no way out, panic turns to terror as events become increasingly ominous in and around the house. Directed by the filmmaking duo of Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, the duo who also gave us the terrifying \"Open Water,\" the new film uses meticulous camera choreography to take the audience on a tension-filled, real-time journey, experienced in a single uninterrupted shot. The film is based on \"La Casa Muda,\" the official Uruguayan entry in the Best Foreign Language category at the 84th Academy Awards.\n\nRated R for disturbing violent content and terror - Tinseltown 17 and Movies 16.\n\nA Thousand Words\n\nEddie Murphy stars as Jack, an agent whose fast-talking and totally insincere patter is his chief weapon. But it irritates his assistant Aaron (played by Clark Duke) and threatens his marriage to Caroline (Kerry Washington). Trouble arrives when he agrees to represent guru and author Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis), who presents a magical Bodhi tree, which sheds one leaf for each word Jack speaks. Jack learns, perhaps too late, that when the tree sheds its 1,000th leaf, he will die.\n\nRated PG-13 for sexual situations including dialogue, language and some drug-related humor - Tinseltown 17 and Movies 16.\n\nCONTINUING THIS WEEK\n\nAct of Valor\n\nKerns Rating: Two and one-half stars\n\nGift-wrapped in red, white and blue patriotism, this began as a training film for U.S. Navy SEALS. However, co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh decided to use some of the footage, and all of the SEALS, and instead transform their footage into a recruitment poster masquerading as an action-packed commercial movie. To their credit, the action sequences are never boring, beginning with the rescue of a kidnapped CIA agent and the discovery of clues unveiling a terrorist plot against the United States. But any scenes meant to develop tension without the use of firearms falls flatter than yesterday's pancakes, thanks to the stars' inability to act, perform or sell their scenes in believable fashion. Actually, those portraying bad guys wind up giving the best performances. Away from the theater, American citizens owe much to our country's Navy Seals, especially after their taking out Osama bin Laden. They are heroes. The right thing to do would be to make movies about them, rather than movies with them.\n\nRated R for strong violence including some torture, and for language - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nThe Artist\n\nKerns Rating: Five stars\n\nI wrote late last year: \"If 'The Artist' is named the Best Picture of 2011 - a likely possibility - it will not be because the film itself is perfect, but rather because it provides a perfect reminder of why we love the movies, and how the medium was born and gradually grew up.\" It deserved each of its 10 Academy Award nominations, especially the one earned by Jean Dujardin (another winner) as 1927 silent film star Georges Valentin. \"The Artist\" is not really a silent film by any means. The original music (another win) by Ludovic Bource helps tell the story, and French writer-director Michael Hazanavicius effectively uses slight noises and spoken dialogue. The story follows Valentin's fall into oblivion, poverty and alcohol when he refuses to accept history's move from silent films to talkies. Only a fan whom he helped transform from flapper into a star (the wonderful Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller) stands by him. One can bathe in the influence of 'Singin' in the Rain,\" with a salute to \"Sunset Boulevard\" (with James Cromwell as a loyal chauffeur). The movie is almost over before it finally solves the mystery of why Valentin risks his career by taking a personal stand against talking pictures. What works best is the delightfully retro world of early motion pictures, back when dames had moxie and the debonair hero always arrived with a confident smile and a pencil-thin moustache. Also providing laughs is terrific, comic support by Valentin's dog, his loyal Jack Russell Terrier.\n\nRated PG-13 for a disturbing image and a crude gesture - Tinseltown 17.\n\nDr. Seuss' The Lorax (in 3-D and 2-D)\n\nA 3-D animated movie based on the 1971 storybook by Dr. Seuss. The film is narrated by a greedy entrepreneur who, despite warnings from the tree-loving Lorax (voice of Danny DeVito), strips a forest of its Truffula trees to manufacture clothing. The results are catastrophic: All the animals leave and nothing is left. Also features the vocal work of Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, Betty White, Ed Helms and Rob Riggle. Co-directed by Chris Renaud, Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul.\n\nRated PG for brief mild language - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (in 2-D and 3-D)\n\nNicolas Cage returns five years after the original \"Ghost Rider\" as Johnny Blaze, still struggling with his curse as the devil's bounty hunter. He has been hiding in a remote part of Eastern Europe, where he is recruited by a secret sect of the church to save a young boy (Fergus Riordan) from the devil (Ciaran Hinds, replacing Peter Fonda). At first, Johnny is reluctant to embrace the power of the Ghost Rider, but it is the only way to protect the boy and possibly rid himself of the curse. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor co-direct, based on the Marvel Comic.\n\nRated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some disturbing images, and language - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nGone\n\nAmanda Seyfried stars as Jill, who returns home from her night shift to find her sister's bed empty. She is convinced that the serial killer from whom she escaped two years ago, has come back for her sister. The police see no proof and do not believe her, and so Jill sets out to find her sister with time running out.\n\nRated PG-13 for violence and terror, some sexual material, brief language and drug references - Movies 16.\n\nJourney 2: The\n\nMysterious Island (in 3-D and 2-D)\n\nKerns Rating: Two and one-half stars.\n\nAn improved, amusing follow-up to 2008 remake \"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" The new 3-D family adventure begins when 17-year old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) receives a coded distress signal from his grandfather (Michael Caine), an explorer on an island that should not exist, There are strange life forms, mountains of gold, deadly volcanoes and plenty of secrets and deadly traps. Sean's stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) goes along, joined by a helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman) and his daughter (Vanessa Hudgens). The film takes for granted that what Jules Verne wrote about was real.\n\nRated PG for some adventure action, and brief mild language - Tinseltown 17.\n\nProject X\n\nThe film follows three seemingly anonymous high school seniors as they attempt to finally make a name for themselves. Their idea is innocent enough: Let's throw a party that no one will forget. But nothing could prepare them for what happens at their party. Word spreads quickly, and dreams are ruined, records are blemished and legends are born. The producers (publicists) submit the film as a \"warning to parents and police everywhere.\"\n\nRated R for crude and sexual content throughout, nudity, drugs, drinking, pervasive language, reckless behavior and mayhem, all involving teens - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nSafe House\n\nKerns Rating: Four stars\n\nA movie in which no CIA safe house is safe, and a bored rookie operative (played by Ryan Reynolds) may finally become an agent if he can only keep rogue spy/\"house guest\" Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) alive long enough to make it to another so-called safe house. The problem, naturally, is that during Frost's 10 years off the grid, he has built a file of corruption within the governments of multiple countries - and it could even be his own government responsible first for some very realistic waterboarding, followed by almost non-stop action and fire-fights. \"Is this even legal?\" asks Reynolds in an early scene; he'll lose that naivety while determined not to lose his prisoner. The movie comes across like a combination of John Woo gunfights and Jason Bourne hand-to-hand combat, helped by cinematographer Oliver Wood, who photographed Woo's \"Face/Off.\" Direction by Daniel Espinosa is first rate, as is the acting.\n\nRated R for strong violence throughout and some language - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nThe Secret World\n\nof Arrietty\n\nKerns Rating: Four stars\n\nA new screen adaptation of \"The Borrowers,\" the popular children's fantasy story by Mary Norton, only this time with a modern Tokyo setting thanks to it being scripted by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi. The movie is suitable for anyone old enough to pay attention, and runs the gamut of dramatic, humorous, charming and sad emotionally. Title character Arietty is a thumb-sized girl who lives with her mom and dad beneath the floorboards of an old country home. They have no idea whether they are the last of their race, and exist day to day as borrowers, occasionally risking their lives - even cats and crows can be dangerous - to engage in hunting excursions for such items as sugar and tissue paper. Their primary rule: Do not ever let a bean (human being) see you. But the film also takes a turn into a possible friendship between Arietty and Sho, a frail human child facing a heart operation.\n\nRated G - Movies 16.\n\nThis Means War\n\nKerns Rating: Two stars\n\nOne of the year's dumbest screenplays. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play fellow CIA agents and BFFs, although their friendship takes a hit when they learn they are dating the same girl, a marketing researcher played by Reese Witherspoon. Never mind that these guys are supposed to be tracking a terrorist, a fairly easy job considering the fact that they killed his brother and the terrorist has since vowed revenge. Instead, they spend a week diverting who knows how much in federal funds to track and attempt to foil one another's dates. Meanwhile, Witherspoon has had so much fun with both men that she is considering using sex as a tie-breaker. Witherspoon is fun to watch, well, at least until she starts devising tie-breakers. Pine and Hardy are gifted actors, but this script makes sure that neither character is a particularly nice guy. We just don't buy it.\n\nRated PG-13 for sexual content including references, some violence and action, and for language - Tinseltown 17 and Movies 16.\n\nTyler Perry's Good Deeds\n\nWesley (played by Tyler Perry) always has done what is expected of him, whether taking over his father's company or becoming engaged to beautiful but restless Natalie (Gabrielle Union). He is jolted out of his predictable routine when he meets Lindsey (Thandie Newton), a down-on-her-luck single mother who works on the cleaning crew in his office building. He offers to help her get back on her feet, and the good deed sparks his courage to pursue the life he really wanted.\n\nRated PG-13 for sexual content, language, some violence and thematic material - Tinseltown 17 and Movies 16.\n\nThe Vow\n\nThe movie enters on a married woman (played by Rachel McAdams) who loses all recent memory in an automobile accident. She struggles to rebuild her identity, while her husband (Channing Tatum) tries desperately to win her heart a second time.\n\nRated PG-13 for a car accident scene, sexual content, partial nudity and some language - Tinseltown 17, Movies 16 and the Stars and Stripes Drive-In.\n\nWanderlust\n\nThis comedy from producer Judd Apatow stars Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston as an overextended, stressed out Manhattan couple. When Rudd's character is downsized out of a job, they stumble upon Elysium, an open community populated by colorful characters who care only about being happy - and where money, careers and clothes are options only if you want them.\n\nRated R for sexual content, graphic nudity, language and drug use - Tinseltown 17 and Movies 16.\n\nThe Woman in Black\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, formerly our favorite young wizard, plays attorney Arthur Kipps in a classic ghost story. He is forced to leave his young son and travel to a remote village to attend to the affairs of the recently deceased Eel Marsh House owner. Working alone in the old mansion, he uncovers the town's tragic and tortured secrets, and fears escalate when he discovers that local children have died under mysterious circumstances."
