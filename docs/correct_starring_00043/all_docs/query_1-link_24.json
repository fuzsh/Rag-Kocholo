Casting of the two male roles is still to be announced.

It was also subsequently produced on Broadway, in a different production starring Glenn Close, and adapted into a film.\n\nAccording to press materials, the play is \"an account of confession and revenge set against the backdrop of a new democracy, emerging from a long period of dictatorship. Newton play Paulina Salas, a former political prisoner who suffered at the hands of a captor whose face she never saw, but whose voice and mannerisms she recalls with terrifying clarity. Years later, and as if by fate, she acts as judge and jury to a man she believes to have been her oppressor. She struggles to find a form of reconciliation for the experience that she and others, have endured.\"\n\nNewton was most recently seen in \"Huge,\" Ben Miller's directorial debut starring award-winning British actor Noel Clarke and Johnny Harris. She is currently filming \"Good Deeds,\" written, starring and directed by Tyler Perry. Earlier this year, Newton also appeared in \"Vanishing on 7th Street\" directed by Brad Anderson in which she starred opposite Hayden Christensen and John Leguizamo. Other recent credits include \"For Colored Girls,\" the adaptation of Ntozake Shangeâ€™s choreopoem directed by Tyler Perry for LionsGate in which she starred opposite Whoopi Goldberg, Kerry Washington, Janet Jackson and Kimberly Elise; and the independent psychological thriller \"The Retreat\" opposite Cillian Murphy and Jamie Bell, directed by Carl Tibbetts.\n\nDirector Jeremy Herrin has directed Polly Stenham's plays That Face and Tusk Tusk, David Hare's The Vertical Hour, Michael Wynne's The Priory and Richard Bean's The Heretic, all for the Royal Court. He is currently represented by Much Ado About Nothing at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre with Eve Best and Charles Edwards.
