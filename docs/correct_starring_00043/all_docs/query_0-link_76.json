        "text": "DirecTV has released an extended first look trailer for its upcoming Thandie Newton-starring drama “Rogue,” the satellite service’s first solo foray into a scripted series, ahead of its debut on April 3.\n\nNewton, in her first regular TV role, stars as Grace, an Oakland detective who, after her son’s murder, goes back undercover in order to investigate the crime boss (Marton Csokas) who had a hand in his death. Ian Hart, Jonathan Holmes, Claudia Ferri, Joshua Sasse and Martin Donovan also star.\n\nAfter resuscitating the ailing “Friday Night Lights” and keeping it going for three more seasons with NBC and picking up “Damages” from FX for two, “Rogue,” is DirectTV’s first attempt at creating its own series from the ground up. The show’s set to premiere on DirecTV’s The Audience Network, a channel exclusively available to subscribers. After first being planned as a three-part miniseries with the BBC, the show, which was created by Matthew Parkhill (“The Caller”) was picked up by DirecTV, who are looking to compete with premium cable channels such as HBO and Showtime’s current premium dramas.\n\nIf you don’t want the events of the first few episodes spoiled, you should probably sit this one out, but otherwise, check out the full 10-minute preview below."
