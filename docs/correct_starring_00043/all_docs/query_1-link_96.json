        "text": "In Hollywood, the year's end marks a time of out with the old and in with the new.\n\nStudio chiefs will no doubt be happy to put 2011 far behind them.\n\nCertainly some cash-cow blockbusters, including installments of \"Harry Potter,\" \"Transformers,\" \"Twilight Saga,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" \"Fast Five\" and \"Mission: Impossible\" franchises, emerged with millions, but overall, the slate of last year's movies, with exceptions such as \"The Help,\" ranged from mild to mediocre.\n\nThat may all change in the next 12 months.\n\nExpect two edgy big-budget adaptations - \"Mirror Mirror\" with Julia Roberts (March 16) and \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" with Charlize Theron (June 1) - of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" Also on the way is the hard-hitting \"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\" with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton (March 2).\n\nGeorge Lucas' \"Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace\" and James Cameron's \"Titanic\" will be rereleased in 3-D. Look for them Feb. 10 and April 6, respectively, with the rest of the \"Star Wars\" titles in line for 3-D rebirths.\n\nAlso getting the pop-off-the-screen treatment is the Disney favorite \"Finding Nemo 3-D\" with the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (Sept. 14), as is \"Leatherface 3-D\" (Oct. 5) with Bill Moseley and Marilyn Burns, who star in Tobe Hooper's 1974 favorite \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"\n\nTo no one's surprise, comic-book superheroes won't be in short supply in 2012.\n\nThey include \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" with Nicolas Cage (Feb. 17); \"The Avengers\" with Robert Downey Jr. (May 4); \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" with Andrew Garfield, who's taking over the role from Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone (July 3); and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" with Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway (July 20).\n\nAlso, expect some remakes. They include Len Wiseman's \"Total Recall\" with Colin Farrell (Aug. 3), Pete Travis' \"Dredd\" with Karl Urban in a remake of \"Judge Dredd\" (Sept. 21), Dan Bradley's \"Red Dawn\" with Chris Hemsworth (Nov. 2), and Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" with Leonardo DiCaprio (Dec. 25).\n\nAnd Ridley Scott's \"Prometheus\" (June 8) is reportedly a prequel to \"Alien,\" although the British director has never confirmed that.\n\nHere's a look at 25 very promising titles set to arrive between Jan. 13 and Dec. 31 (with all dates subject to change).\n\nThe anticipated titles are:\n\n1. \"The Iron Lady,\" with Meryl Streep in a biopic of British leader Margaret Thatcher.
