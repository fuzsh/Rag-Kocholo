        "text": "Thandie Newton is one of the top actresses in the world. She has starred in several films such as Mission Impossible 2, Crash, For Coloured Girls, and Beloved.\n\nWho is Thandie Newton – the woman, not just the actress? While she is a household name in the entertainment industry, there is more to her than just acting. Here is more about her childhood to her ethnicity, royalty roots, family, career, and net worth.\n\nThandie Newton profile summary\n\nName: Melanie Thandiwe Newton\n\nDate of birth: November 6, 1972 (48 years)\n\nPlace of birth: London, United Kingdom\n\nEducation: Downing College, Cambridge\n\nProfession: Actress\n\nHusband: Oliver Ol Parker (married 1998 - present)\n\nEarly life\n\nThandie Newton (real Melanie Thandiwe Newton) was born on November 6, 1972, in London, United Kingdom. There had been rumours that her birthplace is in Zambia. However, this is not true; her parents lived and worked in Zambia but visited London.\n\nThandie Newton is of Zimbabwean and British ancestry. Her mother is of Shona ethnicity - one of the largest ethnic tribes in Zimbabwe – while her father is of British descent.\n\nThandie spent three years as a child in Zambia, where her parents worked in the healthcare sector. However, her parents would later move back to England – with her father taking up the family business. She then spent the rest of her childhood in Penzance, Cornwall.\n\nThandie Newton attended St. Mary’s Roman Catholic school and later a private school – The School of Claire – in Penzance. She has admitted to feeling out of place while growing up, especially while attending catholic school. To start with, she was a black girl with African roots attending an all-white school. She was also an atheist in a Catholic school operated by nuns.\n\nGrowing up in Penzance was not easy for Thandie, despite the beautiful environment. She was a victim of racial abuse by bullies – the town was primarily white in racial composition. She also faced a lot of pressure to fit in. For example, her name Thandiwe – an African name meaning 'beloved' - was 'whitewashed' to a more western version – Thandie. It is only recently that she has reclaimed her real name.\n\nWhile growing up, Thandiwe attended Tring School for the Performing Arts, where she studied dance. Later, after finishing her secondary education, she enrolled at Downing College in Cambridge. In 1995, she graduated with a Social Anthropology degree from the institution.\n\nCareer\n\nThandiwe started her career in the film industry in 1991, with her debut role in the movie Flirting. She would later land another role in 1994, acting alongside Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the film Interview with the Vampire. However, her breakthrough came in 1995 when she played the role of Sally Hemings in Jefferson’s film in Paris.\n\nFollowing her Jefferson in Paris role, Thandie was cast in the filmed Beloved as a titular character. She played alongside other top stars – Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey. Later, she would land another role in Mission Impossible 2 and several other films.\n\nAside from the big screen, Thandie Newton also landed roles in television shows. Her first significant TV role was in 2003, where she played the character Makemba Likasu in ER. Other prominent TV roles she has had include Rogue (2013), The Slap (2015), and her most memorable one, Westworld (from 2016).\n\nThere are several other Thandie newton movies and TV shows. They include:\n\nThe Young Americans\n\nIn Your Dreams\n\nThe Journey of the August King\n\nThe Leading Man\n\nGridlock’d\n\nBesieged\n\nIt Was an Accident\n\nThe Truth About Charlie\n\nShade\n\nThe Chronicles of Riddick\n\nW. (as Condoleezza Rice)\n\nRetreat\n\nAmerican Dad\n\nLine of Duty\n\nBig Mouth\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nVanishing on the 7th Street\n\nGringo\n\n2012\n\nThe Pursuit of Happiness\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story\n\nGood Deeds\n\nHalf a Yellow Sun\n\nFamily\n\nThandie Newton is a recognizable public figure, especially following her successful career in the film industry. But, what is her personal life like? Below is a look at her family life – from parents and siblings to husband and children.\n\nParents and siblings\n\nThandiwe Newton’s parents are Nyasha Newton (birth name Grace Nyasha Jombe) and Nick Newton. Nyasha is an African princess, the daughter of the Shona tribe chieftain from Zimbabwe.\n\nShe migrated to London in 966, where she worked as a nurse. Nick Newton, on the other hand, was a rock band guitarist. After his band disbanded, he moved to London to find work, where he met Nyasha.\n\nAside from Thandiwe, her parents also gave birth to another child – and her younger brother – Jamie Newton. Unlike Thandie, he was born in Zambia before their parents moved back to England.\n\nIs Zoe Saldana related to Thandie Newton?\n\nZoe Saldana is another top actress; people mistake her for Thandie or her sister due to their likeness. They are so alike that Zoe Saldana admitted to her mother confusing her with the Westworld star.\n\nHowever, Thandie and Zoe are not related by blood despite their appearance. They met the first time on the red carpet, which was awkward. However, they have since become friends and contact each other regularly. Zoe even went as far as to say they have become 'sisters'.\n\nHusband and children\n\nIs Thandiwe married? Yes. Thandie Newton’s husband is Oliver 'Ol' Parker, a British film screenwriter, director, and producer. He is best known for his work in Loved UP, In Your Dreams, Imagine Me & You (2005) and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, amongst others.\n\nThandie and Parker met on the set of BBC’s TV show In Your Dreams – where he was a scriptwriter. They got married in 1998 and have been together since then (23 years), making theirs one of the longest celebrity marriages.\n\nThe couple has three children together – Nico Parker, Ripley Parker, and Booker Jombe Parker. All of Thandie Newton’s children have unique names. Her daughters, Ripley and Nico, are named after a movie character (Ellen Ripley from Alien Films) and a singer (Nico). Her son’s name (Jombe), on the other hand, is a tribute to her African roots.\n\nOne of Thandie Newton’s daughter – Nico – has also followed her parent’s footsteps in the film industry. She is a budding actress who got her debut role in the 2019 Walt Disney film Dumbo. She also landed a second role in the 2020 TV show The Third Day.\n\nNet worth and earnings\n\nWhat is Thandie Newton’s net worth?
