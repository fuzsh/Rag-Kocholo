        "text": "You’re 29 years old (give or take). A few years ago, you were just a small town girl from Mississippi a-majorin’ in theatre at a prestigious, private university in a tony enclave near Big D. Now, your first full-length, professionally produced play has made the leap to Broadway, dazzled critics and audiences alike, and captured the Pulitzer Prize. Did I mention that you’re only 29 years old, and that this is your first full length professionally produced play?\n\nThe playwright is none other than SMU alumna Beth Henley, and the play is Crimes of the Heart, the darkly comic yet somehow still life-affirming saga of the troubled McGrath sisters: Lenny (Lenora), Meg, and Babe. When the play begins, childlike Babe has just shot her older politico husband, thereby prompting lonely eldest sister Lenny to reach out to estranged middle sister Meg to come back home. Seems Meg’s been out in Hollywood trying to make it as a singer but not having much luck, which, for her, is par for the course. Meg’s life has been seemingly cursed ever since she found her mother’s dead body oh-so-many years ago, the victim of an apparent murder-suicide. You see, Mrs. McGrath not only hanged herself, she hanged the family’s old yellow cat along with her. The girls, whose dad skipped town years earlier, leading to the mother’s eventual mental unrest, were raised by their granddaddy–now deathly ill himself–and he might not have done such a bang up job: Meg has spent a lifetime trying to suppress her feelings by courting as much pain as possible; Lenny is so self-conscious about her own body that she’s allowed herself to become an old woman well before her time–she’s actually only 30, but her sensibility is that of a woman well-past retirement age; finally, Babe was barely past her high school majorette phase when she jumped at the chance to wed a powerful wealthy man. Only later did she realize that she was out of her league in a loveless marriage. Unfortunately, Babe’s temporary solution leads to an even bigger dilemma, and that’s where the story begins.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Crimes of the Heart made Beth Henley a darling of the theater world. Besides winning the Pulitzer, it was nominated for a bunch of Tony awards, including Best Play–and two nods for Best Featured Actress: Mia Dillon (Babe) and Mary Beth Hurt (Meg); the cast also included Dallas’s own Peter MacNicol as Babe’s earnest young attorney. Later, future Oscar winner Holly Hunter would make her Broadway debut when she stepped into the role of Meg…but more about Hunter later. Eventually, Crimes of the Heart was made into an Oscar nominated film starring a trio of powerhouse talents: Diane Keaton (Lenny), Jessica Lange (Meg), and Sissy Spacek (Babe), all of whom were previous Oscar winners. Spacek secured another nod as did Dallas’s own Tess Harper in the role of Chick, the sisters’ prissy, meddlesome cousin. Henley wrote the screenplay and earned a Oscar nod for her efforts as well. She also worked with no less than rock star-turned-director David Byrne on the screenplay for 1986’s True Stories, which was filmed in and around the Dallas area.\n\nOf course, the trouble with starting your career at the absolute pinnacle is that there really isn’t anywhere else to go but down, and that’s exactly what happened to Henley with her next Broadway play, The Wake of Jamey Foster, which opened in October of 1982. Despite a cast of such reliable talents as Hunter, Anthony Heald, Patricia Richardson (another SMU alumna), Belita Moreno (SMU again), and the great character actor Stephen Tobolowsky (another Dallasite, as well as an SMU grad and occasional Henley collaborator), the play received scathing reviews and closed after only 12 performances. That’s apparently the problem with success that comes too early–but not necessarily too easily–in a career: everyone starts waiting, almost eagerly, for the other shoe not to just drop, but to plummet.\n\nHenley managed to recover ever so slightly with her next venture, The Miss Firecracker Contest, which never made it to Broadway but instead enjoyed a modest run off-Broadway beginning in 1984. It also helped put Holly Hunter on the map. The Miss Firecracker Contest, with Hunter as a young woman hell-bent on rehabilitating her tarnished reputation by becoming a beauty queen, closed in 1985; by 1987, Hunter, who’d only had tiny parts in a few films, was starring in both Raising Arizona and Broadcast News. She received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in the latter. She followed Broadcast News with the film version of The Miss Firecracker Contest, simply retitled Miss Firecracker (1989). The movie was also future Oscar winner Tim Robbins’s next gig after bolstering his rep with a knock-out performance, so to speak, in 1988’s Bull Durham. Miss Firecracker was also the premiere offering from Corsair Pictures, which was the short-lived production arm of the former United Artists theater chain (which has since morphed into Regal Cinemas, but I digress). I would say that most people have not heard of Miss Firecracker, with Hunter’s…crackerjack performance, which is too bad. I’ll always have a soft-spot for Crimes of the Heart, mainly because I’m such a huge fan of all three leading actresses, but Miss Firecracker gets to me on a gut-level. It’s one of the best movies that almost nobody has ever heard of, let alone seen.\n\nHunter plays Carnelle Scott, a small town misfit scraping by, so to speak, at the local catfish farm–that is until her tardiness gets her dismissed in the first several minutes of the movie. Carnelle is an orphan who was raised by her aunt, but now the aunt too has passed away, and Carnelle lives alone in a ramshackle Victorian home that has seen better days. Carnelle has also seen better days. When she was a child, Carnelle suffered from ringworm and used to cover her head with a cap festooned in yellow feathers. She also idolized her two older cousins: Delmount (Robbins), the would-be philosopher with a self-defeating violent streak that’s somehow manifested in an unruly head of hair, and Elaine (Mary Steenburgen), perhaps the most legendarily beautiful woman to ever wear the crown of Miss Firecracker, the queen of the town’s annual Fourth of July celebration. These many years later, with Elaine and Delmount long gone, and Carnelle all too aware that she’s about to be too old to enter a beauty pageant, she decides to make her move. If nothing else, she wants to prove to the townspeople that she’s no longer the promiscuous tart she had been a few years earlier. Plus, almost more than anything, she hopes that some of her cousin’s luster will rub off on her in the form of the beautiful red evening gown that helped the latter on her way to victory several years earlier. Seeing Elaine in her pageant finery waving at an adoring crowd from high atop a parade float is one of Carnelle’s most cherished childhood memories–in a childhood, don’t forget, without a lot to cherish. As it turns out, Elaine comes back home to give a speech at the pageant although she also has other things on her mind; likewise, Delmount, who’s also only been scraping by, returns home with a plan to change his destiny and, perhaps, to help Carnelle change hers as well.\n\nI think Hunter’s particular greatness in this role is how she truly understands that Carnelle is on a journey. See, Henley is a tricky writer. She’s from the South, of course, and she pokes fun at the South, so the task for any actor is to find the truth that’s often buried deep down in the characters in order to keep them from spilling over into mere camp–or even banally inspirational. The movie was shot in the summer of 1988 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Hunter was exactly 30 years old at the time, and while 30 is hardly over the hill, Hunter is quite effective at registering someone much, much younger. Carnelle’s exact age is never mentioned in the movie though Henley’s notes in the published edition of the play puts her at 24. Nonetheless, there are times when Hunter’s awkward body language–it helps, of course, that’s she’s super petite (5’2″)–and her wide open face suggest someone even younger than that: a person who’s perhaps chronologically a young adult but who’s still very much a lost, abandoned, and even naive child–even with her somewhat checkered past. Carnelle looks up to Elaine with nothing but profound and unabashed admiration. At other times, such as when she’s surrounded by a flurry of activity at the pageant’s headquarters, Carnelle looks like a kid in the world’s biggest toy/candy store. She can hardly believe it’s all really happening for her. In one other sequence, she turns misty-eyed watching another contestant’s talent act. That’s the part of Carnelle that wants to be loved, and she sees in other people’s beauty what she can’t see in herself. No playwright can get all of that on the page. Oh sure, the details for such are all in the blueprint, the raw text, but it takes the subtlies of acting to manifest it so sublimely for the audience’s pleasure.\n\nHunter is quite amazing at times. At one point, Carnelle is certain she has flubbed the preliminary round of judging, thereby curtailing any actual involvement in the pageant, and her heartbreak is devastating and genuine–look at the bulging, straining muscles in her neck as she wails on and on about her disappointment. This isn’t an actress who’s pretending or just going through the motions. No, every fiber of her being is fully in the moment, at one with the character’s suffering–however comic it might seem from the outside looking in, at a safe remove. (Of course, her guilelessness practically obliterates that remove.) Carnelle’s despair is soon dispelled–another sterling moment–and, ta-da!–she’s pageant-bound. (Though some of my friends and I have often wondered if Carnelle’s entry to the next level of the pageant is not motivated in part by a desire by the officials to maintain the peace with cousin Elaine.) At any rate, Carnelle soon gets her big chance to impress the audience (both in the pageant and those watching the movie) and the judges with what is called a “marching tap dance routine to the Star Spangled Banner,” and it’s a doozy, I assure you, with Hunter rising to the nearly impossible challenge of actually going through the motions of the choreography but also “selling” the idea that this is something genuinely artistic and beautiful rather than flat-out ridiculous–and she does all that. By the end of the routine, she’s positively radiant.\n\nI won’t give away too much more–as in whether or not Carnelle wins the pageant–but I will reiterate that Carnelle is on a journey, and she has to have the full experience of the pageant in order to grow into who she truly is. It is in these scenes that Hunter astonishes as she continually plumbs the depth of her character’s core. There’s a feistiness, sure, but there’s also strength, determination, a surprising amount of tenderness, and, yes, grace.\n\nThere are three main supporting characters, but let’s start with the two that are closest to Carnelle, at least by blood, and they are Elaine and Delmount. Mary Steenburgen brings Carnelle’s snooty cousin Elaine to brilliant life, which probably isn’t as easy as Steenburgen makes it look; good acting never is. Now, some people might argue that as Streenburgen plays her, Elaine is much too much a phony, but I think that’s something easily explained–and absolutely right. Of course, Elaine is a phony, a pretentious snot with a Southern accent as thick and sweet as molasses–but rather than make her a mere bitch, Steenburgen pulls back Elaine’s facade just enough for the audience to get a glimpse of her soul: her every word and every gesture are calculated to a fare-thee-well, so watching her as she tries to navigate one awkward encounter after another is delightful. It’s all a performance with Elaine, an effect. That much is obvious. What I get out of it is that Elaine has been raised to be a people-pleaser, and that training likely figured into her pageant success and her seemingly perfect marriage–but where has all that dutiful daughter/beauty queen/wife stuff left Elaine? Is there a part of herself she can hold onto when she thinks no one is looking? Steenburgen rises to the challenge of going where Henley leads her in order to show that Elaine is only human. Of course, practically the only person in the community that is not enthralled with Elaine is her brother Delmount. In this piece as well as in Crimes of the Hearts, a recurring theme in Henley’s work is that even when siblings grow into otherwise mature adults with rich and varied experiences, they lapse into their old established childish behavioral patterns when they’re forced into close quarters. In this, Steenburgen and Robbins are right on target. They seem to be having fun portraying mutual antagonism, which is really the point. If Delmount and Elaine didn’t get some psychological satisfaction out of their petty skirmishes, they wouldn’t keep them going, would they? I’ve always thought Robbins’s appeal in his early comic roles is that for the longest time, he had a baby face, doughy and unformed, atop a fully adult body–at 6’5′, he is reportedly the tallest ever Academy Award winner. Of course, those twinkly blue eyes add immeasurably to his charm. This man-child quality is perfect for Delmount, a grown man who talks a good game but still has nightmares, no doubt from watching his own strong-willed mother literally morph into some kind of beast before finally passing away. For Delmount, love comes in unexpected ways, and it allows him to relax for awhile.\n\nAfter Elaine and Delmount, the third key supporting character is Carnelle’s seamstress, a sweet young woman from impoverished conditions (“She lives down by the river”) who, incredibly, began sewing outfits for frogs–as opposed to expensive dolls–when she was just a child. Besides this particular quirk, Popeye has a medical condition that, as her nickname suggests, causes her eyes to bulge out just a bit–and that’s just one part of her affliction. Don’t worry. I won’t spoil the surprises in her story. She gets a chance to explain the whole thing to Delmount in one of the movie’s best scenes. Now there’s, for lack of a better word, a twist to all of this. Director Thomas Schlamme saw fit to cast the great Alfre Woodard in the role. Woodard, for the uninitiated, is African-American. Henley did not write the character with any specific race or ethnicity in mind. Indeed, a Latina, Belita Moreno, played the role off-Broadway, but that was simply incidental. Another friend of mine, a white actress if there ever were one, played the part several years ago (a few years after the movie) in a local production–not that there’s anything wrong with that. By the way, some of my best friends are white. Why am I mentioning this? Well, it’s because I love Woodard, and I think she is marvelous in this role. Her Popeye is such a sweet presence, and her budding romance with Delmount is one of the movie’s many delights. The problem is that because Popeye is a little naive, ditsy even (dare I say childlike), and has, you know, those big bulging eyes, some critics originally lambasted Schlamme and/or Woodard and/or Henley for verging perilously close to the old “pickaninny” caricature of black females not unlike, say, Butterfly McQueen’s portrayal of silly, mouthy, slow-witted “Prissy” in Gone with the Wind. Well, I guess that’s one way of looking at it, but I think Woodard just shines in the role. It’s certainly not her fault that the role is written the way it is, right? My friend played the role much differently than Woodard’s approach, but she couldn’t change the essence of the character: an earnest country bumpkin. Woodard, with her, yes, soulful eyes, beautiful smile, and overall savvy as an actress, makes the role her own–and something far more resonant than a simple stock character. (Personally, I was horrified by the pickaninny-ish caricature of former Secretary-of-State Condolezza Rice served by Thandie Newton–via director Oliver Stone–in W, the 2008 biopic of then prez, George W. Bush.) Plus, it would be ridiculous to make a movie about life in small town Mississippi without a single person of color in a major role. Not only that, Henley’s approach has always been equal opportunity in that she manages to poke fun at almost everyone, black/white, young/old, whatever; the other pageant contestants are a pretty motley bunch, to be sure, with all kinds of oddball flourishes. It’s the job of the actors/actresses to humanize these characters, and that’s exactly what Woodard does. Popeye isn’t a pickaninny; she’s just Popeye. Schlamme and Woodard take a risk here–not the least of which includes depicting an interracial couple, in the 1980s no less, without a single mention of race to be found between them.\n\nThe cast is rounded out by a handful of reliable character actors and a few eager newcomers. First is no less than Scott Glenn, almost unrecognizable as Mac Sam, Carnelle’s sometime squeeze, a carny operator plagued by a lifetime of health issues and rotten luck. He looks like a hippie burnout who never recovered from the 1960s, more dead than alive, actually, yet Glenn invests the character with such tenderness. It’s not a big role, not a flashy one, but Glenn makes a vivid impression. This is the same tough guy that was so riveting as the baddie in Urban Cowboy (drawing comparisons to Clint Eastwood, as I recall); one of his next screen appearances–after Miss Firecracker–was as button-down FBI investigator Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs. What a smart actor.\n\nNext, the late Trey Wilson has a ball playing “Mr. Benjamin Draper,” one of the pageant’s most visible movers and shakers. Draper is the proverbial big fish in a small pond, and anyone who has seen Wilson in his colorful roles in Raising Arizona and Bull Durham knows that the man has no qualms about portraying a buffoon though he’s capable of much more than that, presenting Draper as a lovesick Southern gentleman still nursing a boyhood crush. Of course, Wilson didn’t invent the character. Henley was there to provide the blueprint, but, again, it’s up to Wilson to take Henley’s conceits and find a way to make them endearing to/for audiences, and he does so in fleeting moments with telling gestures; meanwhile, Texas’s own Ann Wedgeworth (a Dallas transplant by way of Abilene) pops up for a few scenes as the pageant’s Mother Hen, the woman whose job it is to mentor the eager, if unformed, hopefuls in their pursuit of that certain Firecracker “spark.” Never mind that Miss Blue seems a bit frazzled, worse for wear, herself. She’s like one of Tennessee Williams’s faded Southern belles with all of the tics and none of the baggage. Wedgeworth has played eccentric characters such as this one on more than one occasion–she had a small role in the same year’s Steel Magnolias–but, of course, directors hire her because she’s good at what she does, and her mere presence–the recognizability of her face if not her name–creates a sense of expectation about a character before the actress even opens her mouth–though her distinctive twang just sweetens the pot. Amy Wright, who’d just been seen as William Hurt’s late blooming sister, Rose, in The Accidental Tourist (1988), is a hoot as one of the town’s leading busybodies, Missy Mahoney; she and her sister Tessy, played by future Tony nominee, Veanne Cox, will likely one day inherit the title of the town’s oddball spinsters. These two are so superficially interchangeable that townspeople can’t tell them apart, referring to each of them only as “Mahoney girl,” at one time or another, yet their temperaments are quite different. Missy is a stuffy prude while Tessa is still at the giggly schoolgirl age. Ever-reliable character actor Bert Remsen drops in for a brief bit as Delmount’s particularly gruff and nasty immediate supervisor at his already unpleasant job. Look carefully as well, and you’ll see Houston’s Greg Germann, years before he hit it relatively big as Ally McBeal’s ex-husband, and, yes, that’s no less than Brent Spiner (as “Data” on TV’s Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time of this film) clocking-in for barely more than a walk-on as a preacher. Angela Turner, a leggy blonde, plays Caroline Jefferson, the allegedly prettiest girl in town. She has all the right stuff, that one, though Henley has given her a quirk or two as well. Finally, gorgeous Lori Hayes scores in the smallish role of a Sally Chin, a contestant who performs her talent act with considerable aplomb and actually looks stunning while doing so.\n\nAs noted, Thomas Schlamme directs the film. His resume at the time consisted of TV work, and he has only directed one feature film since Miss Firecracker: 1993’s So I Married an Axe Murderer starring Mike Meyers and Nancy Travis (a dud). On the other hand, over the past two decades, Schlamme has distinguished himself as one of the most respected of all TV directors, having garnered scads of Emmy and DGA awards for his work on Tracey Takes On…, Sports Night, and, most famously, The West Wing (on which he also served as a co-producer). There’s no doubt that he knows how to bring out the best in his actors. On the other hand, the first chunk of the movie is mostly visually flat. It’s not horrible, but it’s not especially inspired either. Well, part of that is just the reality of having to film some of the earlier scenes in an old rundown Victorian house that is not especially photogenic. Of course, when Bruce Beresford shot Crimes of the Heart, he spruced up his location into Victorian gingerbread loveliness. Schlamme could have had his design team perform a similar makeover, but he didn’t, and his approach seems true to the material even if it doesn’t offer much in the way of eye candy. That noted, there is one interior shot that works like a charm for me, and that’s a closeup of Miss Popeye as she peers through the glass panel of the front door, a panel that is partially obscured from the inside by sheer drapery. The beauty of this image always takes me by surprise, and then I wonder how long it must have taken to light it. The movie becomes much more visually interesting once the action switches to the annual Fourth of July shindig, which, of course, includes the pageant. Schlamme and production designer Kristi Zea work together to create a county fair that’s colorful and exciting without lapsing too far into kitsch or caricature. It looks and feels like the real deal rather than a Hollywood manufactured set. Furthermore, as the festivities stretch from morning to night, Schlamme and cinematographer Arthur Albert create some movie magic, perfectly capturing the mystical quality of a lazy summer evening in the country: at once soothing and mysterious like the fabled “blue hour” of lore.\n\nAgain, as someone who has both read the play and seen it performed live, I have to say that the movie is actually an improvement on the original text. Of course, Henley does the usual job of “opening up” the story. The action in the stage version unfolds either in the old family home or backstage at the pageant. The movie takes place all over Yazoo City, Mississippi (a real town, btw) with plenty of pageant coverage both on and offstage–and those scenes are some of the movie’s most fun and/or memorable. Liberating the action in this way allows Henley to more fully develop things that were sketchy or only hinted at in the text–and that includes introducing a few new characters. Of course, sometimes writers and directors fail when they are too literal in their handling of an adaptation, forgetting the value in the power of suggestion. In Henley’s case, the approach works because it allows her to pare away some of the stagey, expository dialogue and instead frees her to focus on the visual element, showing her characters in the business of doing whatever is they’re doing without having to over-explain themselves. Henley has also, wisely, rethought much of the material, playing with chronology, lifting small snippets of dialogue from given passages and recontextualizing them, and, best of all, tinkering with some of the characters’ motivations, which gives the story some Tennessee Williams-style heft. (Yes, I have referenced Tennessee Williams twice in this piece though I fought myself over it.)\n\nDuring the 1989/90 awards season, Steenburgen was the only Miss Firecracker cast member to receive any kind of accolade: a Best Supporting Actress nomination per the Chicago Film Critics Association. Well, good for her. Steenburgen was actually having a good year in ’89, what with her fabulous performance in this film along with her role opposite Steve Martin in the more well-known, well-liked, Parenthood. [Steenburgen is a previous Best Supporting Actress winner for 1980’s Melvin and Howard.] I happen to think that Robbins, Woodard, Glenn, Steenburgen, natch, and, especially, Hunter all give award worthy performances in this film, but, of course, it’s no surprise that they were overlooked (Steenburgen’s one nod, aside). Okay, so, no Oscar nomination for Hunter. I get it, but what about a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy? Really? Well, no, of course not. Awards are tricky business. With so many films competing for attention, it often takes more than good work alone for a movie to be considered a worthy contender–and in 1989, Miss Firecracker was barely even a blip compared to the likes of Steel Magnolias and Driving Miss Daisy (also based on high profile plays about the South). This movie just wasn’t a hit, not even relative to its tiny budget. For me, the bigger mystery is how Miss Firecracker was allowed to fail in the first place. Again, it was Hunter’s follow-up to her Oscar nominated performance in the popular Broadcast News as well as Robbins’s first feature after his breakthrough in Bull Durham–not to mention the possible allure of Steenburgen, Glenn, and Woodard, hardly unknowns. More confusing is how the mighty United Artists theater chain dropped the ball with its own product. As noted, UA briefly got into–or back into–the production end of movies with Corsair Pictures, so it seems that with all the muscle of one of the biggest–if not the biggest–exhibitors behind it, the movie should not have lacked for anything in the way of distribution or marketing, two major hurdles for most “sensitive” low-budget films, but that was apparently not the case. Btw: this experiment did not last long, as Corsair only released a few more films before closing for good. The company might have fared a little better with Michael Caine in A Shock to the System. Well, there’s a reason why these monopolies were dismantled in the first place.\n\nI, of course, was a UA employee for many years, and I sure did my part to help sell the movie as it was my theatre’s 1989 second quarter project picture. Indeed, this was one of the first big promotional campaigns on which I took a leading role. I worked every possible angle I could from arranging tie-ins with local businesses to decorating the lobby, etc. I’d seen the movie weeks in advance of its opening, and I loved it so much that I just wanted to do all I could to help it succeed. It was a tricky chapter in my own life, full of both old doubts and dreams of many new possibilities, and, similar to Carnelle, I just wanted to make my own mark in a business that I loved while I had the chance. To that end, I succeeded even if the movie did not, earning first place in our region, which meant a nice plaque and a cash bonus. By now, Miss Firecracker is more than 20 years old, and the play upon which it is based is almost 30 years old. Almost everyone has gone on to bigger and better things: Hunter triumphed in 1993’s The Piano, earning virtually every accolade available including an Oscar; Robbins went on to divide his time between acting and writing/directing. He won a Best Supporting Actor for the tragic–dark and tragic–Mystic River, but only after earning a Best Director nod for 1995’s fact-based Dead Man Walking (for which his then longtime lady-love Susan Sarandon won her Best Actress Oscar); Woodard, as noted in the sidebar, has primarily distinguished herself in television, as has director Thomas Sclamme. Steenburgen, who’d already won a Best Supporting Actress for Melvin and Howard (1980) long before Miss Firecracker, stays busy with television work also though she had a role in last summer’s smash hit, The Help.\n\nBeth Henley still hones her craft in the wonderful world of theater though she has not had an official Broadway play in years and years. I often wonder if Henley was really writing about herself to a certain degree in Miss Firecracker. Is she Carnelle, the Mississippi girl who’s determined to get the heck out her small town and make it big, or is she more like Elaine, the girl who got out, hit it big, and then had to regroup when things got tough? Does it even matter anymore? In my book, she’ll always be a winner.\n\nThanks for your consideration…\n\nBeth Henley at the Internet Broadway Database:\n\nhttp://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=4521\n\nBeth Henley at the Internet Off-Broadway Database:\n\nhttp://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=people&keyword=name&first=Beth&last=Henley&middle=\n\nA review of Henley’s The Jacksonian in the LA Times:\n\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/theater-review-the-jacksonian-at-geffen-playhouse.html\n\nToday is my birthday. Most anybody who knows me well knows that I share a birthday with Paul. Sir Paul McCartney of The Beatles, that is. Well, this has always been a lucky thing for me–and I’ve never had to stop and think for a minute when asked that inevitable question, “Who is your favorite Beatle?” Well, it’s Paul, baby, all the way. Always has been; always will be. Of course, besides being one of the most legendary and fabulously successful musicians/recording artists of all time, Paul is also an Oscar winner. Oh sure, he’s acted in a number of films, but his Oscar is a rather bittersweet thing as he and his bandmates (John, George, and Ringo) shared a win for the Let It Be soundtrack, the documentary that more or less captured on film the beginning of the end of the Fab Four. Sad face. McCartney also boasts nominations for the classic “Live and Let Die” (for the 1973 007 film of the same name), and the title tune to the 2001 Tom Cruise/Cameron Crowe oddity, Vanilla Sky. A number of film scholars believe Paul and the gang should have been honored by the Academy for 1964’s A Hard Day’s Night [1], but, of course, as I wrote about earlier regarding the Bee Gees and the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, sometimes it takes Uncle Oscar awhile to catch up with pop culture; after all, from the Academy’s perspective, the real British musical invasion of 1964 was all about whether My Fair Lady or Mary Poppins would capture all the golden glory.\n\nI also share a birthday with Roger Ebert (yeah, okay, I guess), and Carol Kane, whom I wrote about several months ago when her 1975 Oscar nominated offering Hester Street was ushered into the National Film Registry. I also celebrate my special day with Isabella Rossellini. Yep, today Isabella Rosellini turns a whopping 60 years old. Well, good for her. Of course, in many ways, this Swedish-Italian model-turned-actress has been better known for her, um, say, complicated personal life rather than her output in the wonderful world of films.\n\nShe’s famously the daughter–a twin, in fact–of the luminously beautiful Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman (a three time Oscar winner), and Italian director Roberto Rossellini. Among his many honors are an Oscar nomination for the Paisan screenplay, a shared Grand Prize for Rome, Open City at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, and a quartet of nominations for the Golden Lion, the top award at the Venice Film Festival; he won for The Great War; he was nominated for Stromboli, the film that first paired him–scandalously–with Bergman. Ms. Rossellini, on the other hand, was once married to Martin Scorsese though he never featured his wife in any films. After divorcing Scorsese, Rossellini enjoyed a long-term relationship with director David Lynch and a subsequent fling with mercurial actor Gary Oldman. Lynch, of course, featured Rossellini in 1986’s “arthouse” instant classic Blue Velvet, and then again in 1990’s Cannes Golden Palm winner, Wild at Heart. The weird thing is that when Lynch used his beautiful lady-love in his films, he always turned her into a grotesque creature, which seemed cruel to me–as though he were jealous of her marvelous good looks and wanted to punish her. On the other hand, since Rossellini was, at that time, so well known for being the face of beauty in a slew of Lancome ads, maybe she relished the opportunity to liberate herself from all that in order to get down and dirty. Perhaps.\n\nRegrettably, with Rossellini well past the age of 40, good parts are often hard to find though she has eked out a perfectly respectable filmography per her work on/in the likes of Chicago Hope (Emmy nomination), Death Becomes Her (Saturn award for Best Supporting Actress), and The Saddest Music in the World. I like Rossellini best, however, in Cousins, director Joel Schumacher’s gorgeous adaptation of the 1975 French film, Cousin Cousine.\n\nCo-written by Jean-Charles Tacchella and Danièle Thompson, Cousin Cousine is a modern-day pastoral comedy about a man and a woman, incidentally cousins by marriage, who turn to each other for strictly platonic comfort when they realize that their respective spouses are cheating with each other. In an ironic twist, the cheated-upon eventually become lovers as well, which is a complication that the two original adulterers never saw coming as their fling was about nothing more than cheap sex. Love is another matter entirely. When released in the states in 1976, Cousin Cousine was greeted with enthusiastic reviews and, for the times, generous ticket sales, that is, generous considering its subtitles and limited distribution. The Academy was so impressed that its various branches nominated the film in three categories: Best Foreign Language Film, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actress, Marie-Christine Barrault in the role of the virtuous–to a point–romantic heroine. Interestingly, even though fair-haired Barrault was singled out by the American Academy, the French had a much different take, instead showering honors on dark haired vixen Marie France Pisier as the flighty adulteress–she won the Cesar award for Best Supporting Actress; Barrault wasn’t even nominated. I have to say I agree with the French on this one. I missed Cousin Cousine when it first played in Dallas–a quick run designed to capitalize on the film’s Oscar nods, no doubt–but I caught up with it in the spring of ’79 at the old Granada theatre, and I was riveted by Pisier though I thought Barrault was pretty and charming–but an Oscar nomination? Really? [2] Pisier segued to the lead in the lavish film treatment of Sidney Sheldon’s The Other Side of Midnight, a flop aside from its Oscar nominated costumes by famed Irene Sharaff; Barrault appeared as one of three women battling for space in Woody Allen’s consciousness in the uneven–if fascinating–Stardust Memories (1980).\n\nSchumacher’s 1989 translation pretty much follows the original’s template–only with a title that’s actually worse. Who wants to see a movie about cousins falling in love with each other? That’s what the title suggests even though, again, the two leads are only cousins-in-law. I mean, that might have been fine for Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes in Gone with the Wind, but nobody went to see the 1939 epic because of those two knuckleheads. Schumacher’s movie might have just as well been titled Three Weddings and a Funeral, actually, because that’s pretty much the scenario as major chunks of action occur at various family gatherings.\n\nEven with that teensy-misgiving about the title, Rossellini is a delight in the role that helped Marie-Christine Barrault garner a nod back in the 1970s. This is not the kind of part that screams acting awards, Barrault’s success aside, because it doesn’t traffic in big emotions. Rossellini’s Maria is an introvert. Sure, she’s beautiful, but it’s the antithesis of 1980s glitz and glamour: no over-moussed scrunchy perms; no high-fashion “power” makeup. No Lacroix. Instead, Rossellini is a woman prone to keeping to herself and that means dressing down in almost shapeless pastel colored clothes with her chin length hair smoothed back away from her face. It’s almost as though she wants to disappear into the background. Of course, there’s always that knockout bone structure and those dreamy eyes. Maria might want to retreat into the woodwork–she knows her marriage is a sham, and has known it for a long time though she thinks she can salvage her disappointment by being a good mother–but her basic goodness and her capacity to love are always smoldering just beneath the surface, thereby making it impossible for another man not to be attracted to her; her husband is just too inside his own head to see her as she truly is. Indeed, hubby even goes so far as to place Maria on a pedestal to his own detriment.\n\nAgain, a lot of the “acting” that Rossellini is required to do consists of being sad throughout chunks of the movie. Of course, it’s probably easier to merely look sad rather than to convey genuine sadness, and that’s where Rossellini excels: outwardly, yes, there’s body language–but how do you get inside such a reticent character? Rossellini’s deeply expressive eyes pretty much do the trick. Of course, this sad, almost strange, woman is being wooed by a man who’s an unabashed romantic, and it’s fun watching him tease the fun-loving, dare I say girlish, side into fruition. If Maria were to blossom too suddenly, the audience wouldn’t buy it, so Rossellini modulates, building from being tentative to more fully assertive one gesture, one giggle, one sidelong glance, at a time–and when she finally allows herself to feel true unabashed joy, it’s dazzling, miraculous even. Also, when a director casts an actor/actress with a face capable of registering so much with little or no fuss, it cuts down on the need for lots of dialogue, thereby rendering the film more cinematic as evidenced in a near wordless sequence set at a commuter train depot: a complete story in itself. This is a performance so “natural,” so unaffected, that it doesn’t even seem like acting, which, of course, is what makes it so extraordinarily intriguing. Of course, fans of Barrault will say her performance works in the same way that Rossellini’s does, and that the artless unaffected quality is part of its charm–and why Barrault scored an Oscar nomination. Maybe, but I don’t remember caring about Barrault’s character, or her happiness, the way I did, and still do, with Rossellini’s interpretation. I think she somehow manages to take the character and/or level of performance to the so-called next level. Also, as an aside, I think that by writing Maria as an Italian and/or casting an actress with Rossellini’s heritage, the filmmakers maintain much of the original film’s European sensibility, or flavor, if that makes any sense.\n\nEven so, Rossellini isn’t appearing in a love story all alone in a vacuum. She has a leading man, of course, and he’s played by none other than Ted Danson, who at the time of this film was enjoying huge success on TV’s Cheers, besides recently co-starring in yet another American remake of a French film, the hugely popular Three Men and a Baby, per France’s Three Men and a Cradle [3]. Danson is ruggedly handsome–he was once the Aramis man in ads–and he looks just about right as Larry, the laid-back guy who dreams of getting away from it all though he’s still very much in a rut: he’s in the second of two bad marriages, and he hasn’t had much luck with jobs ever since he decided he wasn’t cut-out for the corporate rat race. He and Rossellini have a lovely rapport, and Danson’s considerable charms are also needed to get past the parts of the script that present Larry as the perfect dad to a teenage son. I’m not saying being a great dad is a bad thing–I would never say that–but I just think this particular script strains a bit too much to make sure audiences know that however lacking Larry is in some areas, he is beyond reproach as a parent. I don’t know that I need to know all that.\n\nAs with the French source material, the original cheaters are played by a couple of scene-stealers. First up: Sean Young as Larry’s spouse, Tish. Yes, it’s popular these days to make fun of Young for her, well, peculiar antics, and the truth is she was already garnering unfavorable press around the time this movie was produced and/or released; however, her work in Cousins shows that whatever she is now, she has given a few fine performances in the past. (Remember how good she was in Blade Runner?) Tish is a knockout who believes people only value her for her beauty, so she spends a lot of time, and exerts a lot of energy, trying to convince others of her worth. The trouble is that, aside from being good at her job, she isn’t really sure about who she is on the inside. As such, her emotions are all over the place, and Young registers those changes swiftly and commendably–and when Tish realizes that she’s made one mistake too many, she plays heartbreak beautifully and unexpectedly; I think audiences even root for her in the end. Meanwhile, get a load of a pre-CSI William Petersen as Tom, Maria’s (Rosselinii) husband. He’s a car salesman, and, indeed, a smooth operator, but he has a short fuse, and he’s so eaten up with envy and keeping up with the Joneses that he’s his own worst enemy. Plus, he’s a serial philanderer, and Petersen, playing a such a vile individual, does a wonderful job of showing a man whose ongoing thirst for sex (or conquest) is almost painfully funny. Watch his eyes and lips twitch at the idea of visualizing Young in her black underwear. Marvelous. These two are seemingly perfect for each other–except they’re really not. Here again, I would have easily given nods to both Young and Petersen for their performances in this film: they do the nearly impossible by playing naughty misfits that are subtly comic–and, therefore, potentially believable–rather than outrageously comic. In Cousins, the outrageous comedy is saved for Lloyd Bridges as Danson’s rambunctious uncle–and a potential new love interest for Rossellini’s widowed mother. Lloyd attacks this gregarious role like a pit-bull, playing all the way to the back row and milking each and every laugh for all its worth. His almost every line has the zest of one of octogenarian Sophia Petrillo’s unfiltered zingers on The Golden Girls (per Emmy winner Estelle Getty). It’s a little too corny for my tastes–plus, this grandpappy makes some questionable choices with Danson’s son that we’re supposed to find somehow charming, but it’s not enough to ruin the picture. As I recall, Paramount actually sprang a few bucks for a Best Supporting Actor campaign on Lloyd’s behalf. If it had paid-off, it would have been great because it might have bought more attention to the film.\n\nFurthermore, the delightful cast is completed by the likes of Norma Aleandro, Keith Coogan, and Gina DeAngeles. Aleandro is the sensational Argentine actress who earned international acclaim, including Best Actress honors at Cannes, for the harrowing The Official Story in 1985 [4]; two years later, she scored a Best Supporting Actress nod for Gaby: A True Story. In Cousins, she plays Rossellini’s strongly opinionated mother, Edie, and the two women spar convincingly in one thoughtfully written scene in which Edie thinks it’s the right time for a good ole heart-to-talk though Maria views the situation differently. Coogan, grandson of the one and only Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester in the old Addams Family TV show among others) and the star of such hits as Adventures in Babysitting and Toy Soldiers in his own right, has fun with his role as Danson’s teenaged angsty-multi-media artist who wears his heart on his sleeve; he also looks cool in his vintage threads. (In pains me to add that he’s now in his 40s.) Finally, let me just stop and praise Gina DeAngeles, a pip of an actress who once played a character listed as “Old Crone” in Moonstruck. This, um, rather old, eccentric actress first caught my attention in Woody Allen’s Broadway Danny Rose (1984), playing the domineering matriarch of a bunch of hoodlums. Then, in almost rapid succession, she popped up in Allen’s Radio Days (1987), the aforementioned Moonstruck, Cousins, and a few others. I know almost nothing about the woman, like how long she’d been acting when she started appearing in movies, but I’ve been obsessed with her for years. I even wrote a prominent film magazine one time and asked when the editors might decide to do a feature on her. The editors’ response was that I should watch as many of her movies as possible. Oh well. She looks like the Italian version of Lillian Carter (mother of President Jimmy Carter), and she can be almost frighteningly intense with her steely gaze, yet at the same time, her comic timing is razor-sharp. I bet in her whole lifetime, she never told a joke that fell-flat. How she was ever overlooked for a guest spot on The Golden Girls is beyond me. At any rate, her role in Cousins is basically that of a one-woman Greek–make that Sicilian–chorus. She seemingly knows all and tells all.\n\nCousins is directed by Joel Schumacher, and, yes, like Sean Young he has become an easy target. Many film enthusiasts blame him for destroying the Batman franchise that Tim Burton had launched (or relaunched) so successfully in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Schumacher apparently went from bad (Batman Forever) to worse (Batman and Robin) and seemed to tarnish his reputation forever in some circles. True, this man has directed a lot of overblown junk in his day, but, don’t forget, before he “ruined” Batman, he directed Susan Sarandon to Oscar nominated glory in the 1994 adaptation of John Grisham’s The Client (a movie that seemed to work for both the public and the Academy–always a plus). Plus, he created quite a stir–in a good way–when he cast Colin Farrell, then an unknown quantity to many US. moviegoers, as the lead in 2000’s Tigerland. Schumacher’s work with actors in Cousins is yet more proof that he is not a hack by any means.\n\nFurthermore, the movie is visually sublime, full of nifty touches, one of the most interesting being “Weddingland,” a matrimonial theme park which is the setting for one of the movie’s best sequences. Cousins was filmed in and around Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, and in spite of years of trying, I’ve never been able to track down the actual location of the Weddingland sequence, but it’s a stunner. [Since I wrote this piece–several years ago–a reader has alerted me to the backstory of the real-life Weddingland, a by now long defunct attraction originally known as Fantasy Garden World in Richmond, British Columbia. According to sources, this one has had a contorted history.) Of course, Schumacher’s background is in visual merchandising: he graduated from the Parsons School of Design and had worked as a department store window dresser before he broke into the movie biz–first as a costume designer [5]. At any rate, there’s something fascinating in the Weddingland sequence in which almost every shot seems to be perfectly coordinated with Rossellini’s creamy pastels and her beautiful sash (a gift from her husband in an act of contrition) [6], and/or her mother’s floral prints. Look closely: the mother’s cigarette is lavender and matches the colors in her dress. Another scene in a chic restaurant seems entirely designed to bring out the blue in Lloyd Bridges’s eyes. Perhaps best of all is the sequence in which Larry and Maria enjoy a breezy motorcycle ride en route to a lake for an afternoon getaway. The gorgeous natural scenery and thrilling aerial shots, along with Rossellini’s uninhibited beauty and the giddily rhapsodic strings in Angelo Badalamenti’s luscious score, make the whole thing divinely over-the-top, like the world’s most fabulous perfume commercial or an attempt to out French-i-fy French cinema at its own game. Later, and this is important, there is a shot of Rossellini soaking in all the beauty of the lake from a cottage porch, a shot in which the audience clearly sees Maria through Larry’s eyes, that is without a doubt one of the most breathtaking images I have ever seen in a movie–the setting, the lighting, and composition instantly bring to mind Maxfield Parrish’s intensely saturated mythological vistas, and I would be willing to bet that this was exactly Schumacher’s intent–and, fortunately, he doesn’t overplay his hand: the shot builds and then is gone in an instant, with Schumacher wisely leaving the audience wanting more. (Unfortunately, unless you watch the movie on pretty large TV, the impact of its stunning visuals will be diluted–per that slim lavender cigarette of Aleandro’s; on the big screen, it is/was almost too sublime for words.)\n\nBecause Cousins wasn’t a huge hit in its day, it is hardly surprising that it fell short with the Academy as well though the critics were generally kind to Rossellini. (I’m including a link to Roger Ebert’s review.) Of course, whether it was a hit at all is a matter of interpretation, I guess. Per the Internet Movie Database, the film cost an estimated $13 mil (these are 1988/89 dollars, mind you) and pulled in around 22 million in the U.S., a number corroborated by Box Office Mojo. Of course, 22 mil is obviously more than 13 mil, but once you factor in the costs of marketing and distribution, generally about half as much as the production costs, you’re left with a meager profit, if any. I don’t know that I trust the way the figures have been reported for this movie–mainly because I know too much about the business of reporting grosses works. At any rate, I remember playing this movie back in the day, and I remember that it performed quite well for us, maybe playing for as many as 10 weeks. The theatre I worked in at the time definitely knew how to crank up the THX sound for summer and holiday blockbusters, such as Return of the Jedi (1983), Fright Night (1985), Top Gun (1986), Aliens (1986), Batman (1989), and Independence Day (1996), but our bread and butter demographic during the rest of the year was the Far North Dallas Ladies-Who-Lunch-Bunch, and, believe me, when the women in this crowd liked a movie, such as this one, they would come in droves, week after week [7]. That’s the interesting thing about the biz: a movie can perform quite splendidly in some markets while only doing middling business in others. The old UA would always do well on this kind of movie even if other theatres did not. (On the other hand, kiddie movies were always hit and miss with us even when they were gangbusters everywhere else.)\n\nAs I have noted in previous articles, 1989 was a highly competitive year for actresses with the Oscar line-up including at least three candidates that were right on the money, and a pair of likeable lightweights [8]. There were several omissions from films with far higher profiles than Cousins, so Rossellini’s exclusion not shocking, especially since someone had already been nominated for a movie using the same material. Oscar doesn’t generally “do” remakes, the recent revision of True Grit, starring Best Actor nominee Jeff Bridges, aside. That noted, even given Rossellini’s predicament, and the omissions of Sean Young, William Petersen, and, okay, Lloyd Bridges, I think Cousins should have been better promoted by Paramount: cinematography (Ralf Bode), music (Badalamenti [9]) , art direction (Mark S. Freeborn/Linda Vipond), and, heck, even screenwriter Stephen Metcalfe’s faithful adaptation.\n\nI’m glad I own a DVD copy of Cousins. Similar to the Ladies who Lunch, I can watch it again and again, sometimes keeping it in the machine for repeat viewings. It’s something pretty that helps me unwind after a stressful day. Still, I do wish there were some extras: interviews with Schumacher, Rossellini, and the rest of the cast, or even an audio commentary. Something. It’s one thing for a movie to be overlooked by the Academy. It happens. It’s quite another for such a beautiful film to be so shabbily treated by the studio that made it. Doesn’t Isabella Rossellini deserve just a tad more respect regarding her only conventional romantic leading lady role in a mainstream Hollywood film? In a word: oui.\n\nThanks, Isabella, and happy birthday to you…\n\nRoger Ebert’s review of Cousins:\n\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890210/REVIEWS/902100302\n\n[1] – I’ll leave it to the experts to debate the Oscar worthiness of the Yellow Submarine score and/or its individual songs–except that since the title tune was not unique to the movie, it was not eligible.\n\n[2] – By the way: the Best Actress Oscar that year went to Faye Dunaway (Network); the competition also included Liv Ullman (Face to Face), Sissy Spacek (Carrie), and Talia Shire (Rocky).\n\n[3] – The 80s was definitely the decade in which remakes of French films seemed like a good idea to American producers and/or studio heads. A few others include The Toy (1982, adapted from Le Jouet), The Woman in Red (1984 from Pardon mon affaire), and The Man with One Red Shoe (1985 – The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe).\n\n[4] Technically, Aleandro tied with Cher (in Mask) for the Cannes honor.\n\n[5] An early Schumacher job was as costumer on Woody Allen’s Interiors; he also wrote the screenplay for the original Car Wash; his other credits as a director include Lily Tomlin’s satirical The Incredible Shrinking Woman, along St. Elmo’s Fire, The Lost Boys, and Flatliners. Always a slick stylist, Cousins is softer than Schumacher’s usual bag of tricks, but by the time he got to the Batman movies, he was far too impressed with himself, throwing way too much at the screen.\n\n[6] – Actually, Maria’s Weddlingland ensemble represents a bit of a compromise as the character sports gifts from both her husband (Tom) and her soulmate (Larry).\n\n[7] – Add to Cousins the following films that were big favorites of the ladies who lunch at the old UA (i.e., multitudinous repeat viewings over several weeks, if not months): The Accidental Tourist (1988), The Big Chill (1983), The Bodyguard (1992), Children of a Lesser God (1986), 84 Charing Cross Road (1987), Moonstruck (1987), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Steel Magnolias (1989), The Woman in Red (1984), John Sayles’s Baby, It’s You (1983), and anything starring Bette Midler; of course, Titanic (1997) played to all demos–and even though it seems unlikely to think so, Driving Miss Daisy (1989) had great legs, as they say in the biz, and attracted scads of moviegoers young and old alike–not just little old ladies.\n\n[8] The three heavyweights, in my opinion, were Jessica Tandy (the winner–for Driving Miss Daisy), Jessica Lange (Music Box), and Isabelle Adjani (Camille Claudel). The lightweights, to me, were Michelle Pfeiffer (The Fabulous Baker Boys) and Pauline Collins (Shirley Valentine); neither were bad, but I don’t think they were exceptional. Collins is an interesting case: her movie was released by Paramount, and, again, per Box Office Mojo, earned a scant 6 million in ticket sales, far less than even Cousins, but because Collins had won the Tony for the stage version of Shirley Valentine, I guess Paramount opted for the prestige factor and invested in a real campaign. (Skeptics will likely ask whether it isn’t possible that Academy voters simply preferred one actress to another and that all this other stuff is beside the point. Of course, there’s always that, but, there again, Oscar campaigning is very much a reality, and at the end-of-the-year, it’s hard for movies to get noticed without some kind of push by the studios, and not all films are promoted equally. Simple as that.) Collins was also Globe nominated, btw. Certainly, onstage it was a powerful role as Collins more or less enacted all the characters in a one-woman show; however, with the movie considerably “opened” for the screen and cast with terrific supporting actors such as Tom Conti, Bernard Hill, Joanna Lumley, and Alison Steadman, Collins’s performance somehow seems less remarkable as does the material itself. Among the high profile actresses overlooked that year: Andie MacDowell (sex, lies, and videotape), and Sally Field (Steel Magnolias), among others.\n\n[9] – The lush romanticism of Badalamenti’s score for Cousins is atypical of his more well-known work for director David Lynch in such “eerie,” for lack of a better word, projects as Blue Velvet (1986) and TV’s Twin Peaks, which followed Cousins by a year."
