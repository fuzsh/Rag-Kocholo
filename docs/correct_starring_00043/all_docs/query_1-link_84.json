        "text": "Actress Thandie Newton is clearing the air on why she’s no longer working on “Magic Mike 3.”\n\nIn a recently released statement, a rep for Thandie Newton denied allegations that she was fired from the third installment of the popular movie series. Following Thandie Newton’s departure from the film “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” rumors circulated that a heated exchange with the film’s star Channing Tatum led to Thandie being fired from the project. According to an inside source, the former co-stars argued about Will Smith infamously slapping Chris Rock. Reportedly, the source stated:\n\n“They fell out over the debacle at the Oscars…I was on set. I watched her and watched him. They were in and out of the house where we were filming having this confrontation.”\n\nThe source continued and alleged that Channing Tatum, 41, was irate following the altercation. Cutting Thandie, 49, out of the movie series he is a producer for – stating in so many words:\n\n“I am not working with her anymore….It’s my movie, so she’s off the movie.”\n\nChanning has starred as the movie’s main character since the first “Magic Mike” installment was released in 2012. The source also claimed that since Channing is the number one guy on set, he was given the final say. Additionally, the insider added the movie’s director, Steven Soderbergh, attempted to diffuse the situation to no avail.\n\nDespite reports that the blow-up ended Thandie’s time on set, Warner Bros and Thandie’s legal team has denied these claims. The network stated the “Westworld” star left after 11 days on set to “tend to family matters”. While a rep for Thandie stated:\n\n“This report is completely inaccurate.”\n\nAccording to reports, Thandie was replaced by actress Salma Hayek, 55, following her departure from the film.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Thandie splitting from the Magic Mike set? Leave them in the comments!"
