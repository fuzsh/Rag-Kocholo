        "text": "Having developed the brand of its Audience Network around shows like “Damages” and “Friday Night Lights,” which it has shared with or inherited from other broadcasters, the satellite television provider DirecTV said on Thursday that it had ordered its first original scripted series, one that rests on the slender shoulders of the actress Thandie Newton.\n\nMs. Newton, who has appeared in films including “Crash,” “Beloved” and “Mission: Impossible 2,” will star in the new series, called “Rogue.” DirecTV said in a news release that the series would focus on Ms. Newton’s character, a “morally and emotionally conflicted cop” named Grace, who is wrestling with the possibility that she may have contributed to the death of her son while she conducts an illicit affair with a high-ranking criminal who may have also been involved. “Rogue” is planned to start production in August and make its debut on the Audience Network in the summer of 2013.\n\nDirecTV previously showed the final seasons of the high school football drama “Friday Night Lights,” in a co-production with NBC, on what was then known as the 101 Network, changing its name to the Audience Network last year. It also took over on “Damages,” a legal thriller starring Glenn Close and produced by Sony Pictures Television, after that series was dropped by the cable channel FX.\n\n“Rogue” will be produced by the independent studio Entertainment One Television and Greenroom Entertainment."
