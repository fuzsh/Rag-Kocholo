After learning that both men went to performing arts high schools, Newton said, “That’s interesting,” considering they both spent time as actors and rappers. She went on to reveal, “Donald has what Tupac had without the self-harming element.” Newton recalled Shakur carrying around anger and generational trauma because of what his mother, Afeni Shakur, a jailed member of the Black Panthers, went through."
