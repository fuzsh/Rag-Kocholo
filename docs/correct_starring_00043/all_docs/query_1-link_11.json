        "text": "Gabrielle Union talks about her new movie, “Good Deeds,” a romance drama where she co-stars opposite Tyler Perry and Thandie Newton.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Lions Gate Entertainment)\n\nOne of today’s hottest stars, Gabrielle Union, continues to shine. She will soon appear in Screen Gems’ “Think Like a Man,” based on Steve Harvey’s book “Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man,” which is slated for release on March 9, 2012.\n\nGabrielle’s impressive film credits include the critically acclaimed “Cadillac Records,” “The Perfect Holiday,” “Tyler Perry’s ‘Daddy’s Little Girls,” “Deliver Us from Eva,” “Love and Basketball,” “The Brothers,” “The Honeymooners,” and “She’s All That.”\n\nShe made her television debut on the hit sitcom “Moesha,” before going on to guest star on such series as “ER,” “Dave’s World” and “The Steve Harvey Show.” Shortly thereafter, Gabrielle had a recurring role on two WB hit shows, “Sister, Sister” and “7th Heaven.”\n\nShe also stirred things up on “Friends” when she played a love interest to both “Joey” (Matt LeBlanc) and “Ross” (David Schwimmer). In that role, Gabrielle marked the first African American love interest on the series.\n\nGabrielle’s passion for acting is rivaled by her involvement as an ambassador for the Susan G. Komen Foundation, as well as her support for the Young Survivor Coalition (YSC) and the Rape Treatment Center (RTC) at UCLA.\n\nShe helped found a program called “A Step for Success” which helps to raise funds for the economically challenged Kelso Elementary School located in Los Angeles. Gabrielle now serves as a brand ambassador for Neutrogena and is featured in its national television and print campaigns.\n\nA native of Omaha, Neb., Gabrielle currently resides in Los Angeles. Here, she talks about her new movie, “Good Deeds,” a romance-drama where she co-stars opposite Tyler Perry and Thandie Newton.\n\nWhat interested you in collaborating with Tyler again and in playing Natalie in “Good Deeds?”\n\nOnce I read the script, the biggest thing was that I loved how he didn’t make her a bitch. My character’s usually the villain in this sort of romantic drama.\n\nI was very happy that Tyler made her a normal person who has a great career, great friends and who comes from a great family. So, in this case, maybe the relationship’s just not working instead of my character’s being an evil shrew.\n\nHow was it working with this cast?\n\nPhylicia [Rashad] is an icon, and she’s amazing. Just being able to watch her work up close is like taking a master class in acting.\n\nThandie was great, and having Beverly Johnson play my mother was huge, and a nice ego boost. The whole experience felt like being in a big, happy, well-functioning family.\n\n“Good Deeds” is a film about a “defining moment.” Has there been such a moment in your life or career you’d like to share?\n\nIn my life, when I got divorced. I sort of realized that I hadn’t been making sound choices which were the best for me to pursue my hopes and dreams and aspirations and passions.\n\nI had been living the life that society tends to dictate for women of a certain age. You marry the person who asks you, even though he may or may not be the best one for you.\n\nAround the time that I got divorced, I had an epiphany that there is no blue ribbon or gold medal for living someone else’s life, for fulfilling someone else’s dreams. It doesn’t make you happy. You just end up with a life that’s not yours. So, I decided to follow my dreams and my passions and to always have an adventure, no matter what it is.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nTwitter.\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\nIt’s called “Singleholic.”\n\nWhat’s the last song you listened to?\n\n“Groove Me,” by Guy.\n\nWhat is your favorite dish to cook?\n\nCollard greens.\n\nWho is your favorite clothes designer?\n\nWhoever’s giving out free stuff. [Laughs]\n\nWhen you look in the mirror, what do you see?\n\nMy mom.\n\nHow often do you get back to Nebraska to see her?\n\nPretty often. I go back quite a bit, although I don’t announce my visits, in order to protect our privacy.\n\nWhat’s it like to lose your anonymity? Can you go to the mall or a movie theater?\n\nI can go, but you go with the understanding that people are going to know who you are, and may or may not respect your privacy. The time when I most want privacy and my anonymity is to do things like buying tampons.\n\nIf you could have one wish instantly granted, what would that be for?\n\nMy wish for the world would be to end violence against women. My wish for myself would be for peace of mind.\n\nWhat is your earliest childhood memory?\n\nPlaying catch with my dad.\n\nWho was your best friend as a child?\n\nThere were ten of us. We were called The Bash Crew.\n\nWhen did you realize that you had made it?\n\nI haven’t made it yet.\n\nHow do you get through the tough times?\n\nI eat.\n\nWhat key quality do you believe all successful people share?\n\nGreat communication skills.\n\nWhat excites you?\n\nA great sporting event.\n\nWhat was the best business decision you ever made, and what was the worst?\n\nMy worst was co-signing on a car loan for someone who had an aversion to paying their bills. My best, probably, was taking the role of Muddy Waters’ wife in “Cadillac Records.”\n\nHow did your first big heartbreak impact who you are as a person?\n\nI think the impact is that you become a little hardened and you protect your heart a little more. You’re not as open, or so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n\nI was only broken up with once. He just happened to go on to become famous. So, the story has lived on in infamy. Jason Kidd dumped me two weeks before the junior prom.\n\nI kind of hoped he’d go off and no one would ever hear of him again. But, in this case, he went on to a Hall of Fame career in the NBA.\n\nWhat is your favorite charity?\n\nGosh, I can’t pick a favorite. I’m a Susan G. Komen global ambassador. I speak on behalf of Planned Parenthood as well. I love UCLA’s Rape Crisis Center. Me and my girls have our own nonprofit, called A Step for Success. I truly love them all.\n\nWhat has been the biggest obstacle you have had to overcome?\n\nGetting raped.\n\nWhat advice do you have for anyone who wants to follow in your footsteps?\n\nStay in school. You have the rest of your life to act.\n\nDo you ever feel pigeonholed or pressured to not change creatively?\n\nWhat’s interesting is that producers, directors and writers tend to typecast me in terms of whatever movie they’ve seen me in most recently.\n\nWhat price are you willing to pay for a cause that is bigger than your own self interest?\n\nI’ve lost a lot. I’ve lost money, and my reputation has taken a hit for taking the high road to protect my dignity, to protect children, and for other good causes. But I don’t think there’s ever too steep a price for doing the right thing.\n\nHow do you want to be remembered?\n\nAs someone who was genuinely happy and who smiled a lot."
