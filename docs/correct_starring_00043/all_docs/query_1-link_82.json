        "text": "Roland Emmerich may have failed to set the world alight with his last flick, 10,000 BC, but this hasn’t stopped him putting together an all-star lineup for his next project – the apocalyptic sci-fier 2012.\n\nThe film, which will be written by Emmerich and Harald Kloser, already has John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor on board and now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, boasts the likes of Danny Glover, Thandie Newton and Oliver Platt too. The film tells the story of an apocalyptic event that threatens the future of mankind. Cusack will play an academic researcher looking to prevent said apocalypse from occurring, and Ejiofor a science advisor to the US President, with Dannny Glover set to play the President, Thandie Newton his daughter and Oliver Platt as his chief of staff.\n\nDespite this sterling cast, expectations are somewhat measured for Emmerich’s movie. Shooting to fame with Independence Day and Stargate, the German director has failed to deliver a hit for some time, his last three efforts being the underwhelming Godzilla, the lacklustre Day After Tomorrow and the misfiring 10,000 BC. With a decent script, though, and a stellar cast such as this, 2012 could be the rejuvenating hit the writer/director sorely needs.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNo related posts."
