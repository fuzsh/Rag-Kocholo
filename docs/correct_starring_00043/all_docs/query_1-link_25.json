        "text": "Is it a hot take to say that Chris Pine is an underrated actor? I mean, sure he’s been in massive blockbusters like “Wonder Woman” and the “Star Trek” franchise. He’s also not struggling to find work, as he has a number of films lined up. But he might not actually be mentioned in the Top 3 Actors Named Chris (Hemsworth, Evans, Pratt all come to mind, with their respective Marvel roles pushing them over the top). But no matter how you slice it, there’s no denying that Pine is a solid actor that deserves a ton of recognition. Hopefully, he will find that starring opposite another underrated actor, Thandie Newton, in the upcoming film, “All the Old Knives.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Wonder Woman 84’: Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah Is Finally Unleashed In New DC FanDome Trailer\n\nAccording to Deadline, Pine and Newton are set to headline a new Amazon thriller, “All the Old Knives,” which will be directed by Janus Metz. The film is based on the novel of the same name from author Olen Steinhauer, who also wrote the script for the adaptation. “All the Old Knives” centers on two ex-lovers, one a current CIA operative and the other an ex-spy, who reminisce over dinner about their lives together and the missions they went on. Of course, you can’t get two spies involved in a dinner and talk about the old days for very long before violence breaks out, and that’s exactly what happens.\n\nAs mentioned, the film is set to be directed by Metz, who is probably best known for helming the drama, “Borg vs. McEnroe.” The Danish filmmaker also recently helmed episodes of the acclaimed Amazon series, “ZeroZeroZero.”\n\nInterestingly, this is a project that Pine has been attached to for a while now. Previously, back in 2017, it was reported that he was going to star opposite Michelle Williams in the film. Obviously, over the years, that has changed.\n\nREAD MORE: Thandie Newton Agrees With ‘Crash’ Criticisms & Says It “Neutralized The Very Real Rage” That Black People Feel\n\nPine has no shortage of projects in development. First, he’s set to star in Olivia Wilde’s new thriller, “Don’t Worry Darling.” He’s also signed on to headline a reboot of “The Saint.” There’s also a new biopic about Walter Cronkite, “Newsflash,” as well as yet another film, “Violence of Action.” Oh, and let’s not forget “Wonder Woman 1984” and the eventual “Star Trek” sequel, if that ever gets made.\n\nNewton is also really busy currently, with a starring role in HBO’s hit series, “Westworld.” She also recently appeared in films such as “The Death and Life of John F. Donovan” and Lucasfilm’s “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” Newton will next appear in the upcoming sci-fi film, “Reminiscence,” where she’ll star opposite Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson.\n\nThere’s no release date set for “All the Old Knives,” but with Pine and Newton, this is definitely a film we’ll be keeping an eye on."
