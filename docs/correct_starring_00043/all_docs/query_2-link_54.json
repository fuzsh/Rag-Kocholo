        "text": "I don't know about this third Riddick movie. Literally, I don't know very much about it at all. News of its existence had hit my ears, but I just thought Hollywood was kidding. The whole project sounds like an idea from a parallel universe, where you just nod and accept what they do over there because you don't want to step outside the bounds of culturalÂ relativism. In any case, Universal is releasing it in both regular theaters and IMAX September 6, 2013.\n\nI actually like the first two Riddick films, but even if this third one turns out incredible, I feel like its potential culturalÂ excitementÂ level has a remarkably low glassÂ ceiling due to the fact that no one asked for the last film, no one saw that film, and even more no one asked for this one.\n\nAnd yet Universal feels they have something big enough to put on IMAX screens. I hope they're right. Whether people see it or not has little bearing on how much enjoyment I get from the film. The images released so far look awesome, too. I may question why this film was made, but I'm curious enough to be glad it was, even though it feels about a hair away from being another Lockout.\n\nSeptember feels like a smart month for this kind of film as well. Temperatures start to cool, the warm explosions of summer are but a distant memory, and theaters begin to fill with Oscar dramas exploring the human condition. A wild romp across the rusted cosmos with aÂ monosyllabicÂ xtreme sports athlete might be just what the doctor ordered."
