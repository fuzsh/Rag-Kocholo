        "text": "Actress Katie Holmes began following Thandie Newton after the latter's recent remarks about Tom Cruise.\n\nKatie,41, had been married to Cruise from 2006 to 2012 and they share a daughter, 14-year-old Suri.\n\nThe Dawson's Creek star only recently began following Thandie, 47, this week.\n\nIn an interview published on Tuesday by Vulture, Thandie had shared her experience of working with Tom and a colourful story about their time together on the set of Mission: Impossible II.\n\nShe played Nyah Nordoff‑Hall opposite Cruise's Ethan Hunt in the 2000 action thriller.\n\nWhen asked about her work on the film and why she never returned for the sequels, Thandie was rather candid.\n\nShe said: \"Oh, I was never asked. I was so scared of Tom. He was a very dominant individual. He tries superhard to be a nice person.\n\n\"But the pressure. He takes on a lot. And I think he has this sense that only he can do everything as best as it can be done.\"\n\nThandie also revealed of a strenuous rehearsal for a scene that was not going well when shooting - where Tom asked her to play him and vice-versa.\n\nShe explained: \"It just pushed me further into a place of terror and insecurity. It was a real shame.\"\n\nHowever, the most memorable element of Thandie's comments on Tom had to be her description of a growing spot on his face while they were filming one night.\n\nThandie recalled: \"I remember at the beginning of the night, seeing this slight red mark on his nose, and by the end of the night, I kid you not — this is how his metabolism is so fierce — he had a big whitehead where that red dot was.\n\n\"It would take anyone else 48 hours to manifest a zit.\n\n\"I saw it growing, and it was like the zit was me, just getting bigger and bigger.\"\n\nThe no-holds-barred account seems to have gone down a treat with Katie.\n\nThe actress won custody of her and Tom's daughter Suri in 2012, with sources telling the New York Post that Holmes feared her ex-husband would try to abduct his daughter.\n\nThere were also detailed reports that Holmes feared Cruise's associates in the Church of Scientlogy.\n\nA friend of the actress told the New York Post in 2012: \"Katie saw all the pressure. They [Scientologists] are professionals at pressuring people to be quiet.\"\n\nTom was previously married to actress Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990.\n\nHe went on to marry actress Nicole Kidman the same year and the pair went on to adopt two children: Isabella and Anthony.\n\nTom filed for divorce from Nicole in 2001 around the time she suffered a miscarriage.\n\nThandie praised Nicole in the interview she gave with Vulture, crediting her for her part in Mission: Impossible II.\n\nShe said: \"Nicole was a huge advocate for me.\""
