The film unravels the centuries-long life of Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), a reluctant vampire, as he recounts his tale to a modern-day journalist (Christian Slater). Turned into a vampire by the charismatic yet ruthless Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise), Louis grapples with his new existence. Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a child turned into a vampire, adds another layer of complexity to their unconventional family dynamic. This Gothic horror-drama, based on Anne Rice's popular novel, earned two Academy Award nominations and remains an iconic entry in the vampire genre.\n\n5\n\nJohn Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet\n\nReleased : 2009\n\nDirected by : Roland Emmerich\n\nIn the disaster movie 2012, the world faces an apocalyptic cataclysm of biblical proportions.

A pivotal car accident links these disparate lives together, setting off a chain reaction of events that challenge their perspectives on race and humanity. This film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Picture."
