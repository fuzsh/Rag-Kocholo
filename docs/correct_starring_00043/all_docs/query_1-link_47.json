        "text": "What would you say if I told you that in 2012 there will be a Kennedy back in the White House; California finally falls into the Pacific; and the Vatican literally becomes a holy roller?\n\nIf you answered “Roland Emmerich,” you’d be right on the money. But then, who else would have the cojones to flatten 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with the aircraft carrier JFK, or turn the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica into a bowling ball?\n\nWho does this guy think he is? Osama bin Laden? No, more like Michael Bay, only with a bigger budget, better actors and special effects guaranteed to blow your mind. Not that you’ll have much of a mind left by the time his “2012” runs its destructive course. But who needs a brain when we’re all gonna die three years hence anyway?\n\nWho says so? The Mayans, that’s who. Check their ancient calendar. It runs out Dec. 21, 2012, which means they either exhausted their printing budget or ever-so-nonchalantly were informing their descendants when the end of days would be at hand.\n\nEmmerich, ever the cockeyed pessimist, subscribes to the latter. And to his credit, he’s created his blow-up-the-world epic early enough to die a very rich man once his blockbuster completes its theatrical and home video run sometime next year.\n\nAs for the rest of us, “2012” certainly entertains in a so-bad-it’s-good way, but it also makes us pissants privy to what happens to the fat cats and lucky dogs with fortunes significant enough to survive the apocalypse.\n\nAt least we can take peace in knowing that following our violent, fiery deaths the likes of John Cusack’s divorced dad and Oliver Platt’s power-hungry presidential chief of staff will inherit the Earth – or what there is left of it once angry old Sol (the villain of the piece) and Emmerich are done crushing landmarks like a 5-year-old smashes his Legos.\n\nThey do it gleefully, too. Which is surprising because you’d think Emmerich would have had enough of this kind of stuff after blowing up the world twice before in “Independence Day” and “The Day After Tomorrow.” I mean, how many times can you fell the White House and Malibu mansions without getting bored?\n\nNot a problem when you’re as easily amused as Emmerich, who easily amuses us with his laughably bad dialogue and preposterous characters and situations. It’s bombastic, but it’s the sort of bombast moviegoers love: instantly forgettable fluff that keeps you on the edge of your seat as long as Emmerich doesn’t allow you a moment to think. Which, to his credit (is that the right word?), isn’t very often.\n\nWith a running time of slightly more than 21/2 hours, that’s impressive. But a lot of that ability to divert must be credited to his sprawling cast, which also includes Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Tom McCarthy, Thandie Newton and Danny Glover as a black president as doomed as every black president on TV’s “24.”\n\nWhich reminds me: Why do all these calamities – be it the comet in “Deep Impact,” the terrorist attacks on “24,” the economic meltdown – occur when a black man is in the Oval Office?\n\nAh, but I digress form the idiocy at hand. And that would be “2012,” which begins as all disaster movies do with a rapid, vapid introduction to the major players. In this case, we have the scientist and politicians on one side, including Platt’s chief of staff and Ejiofor’s government geologist; and the everymen – Cusack’s failed writer, his ex-wife (Peet) and her new plastic surgeon boyfriend (McCarthy) – on the other.\n\nAs the White House covertly takes steps to save the pampered tushies of the rich and powerful, the schlubs like Cusack and his broken family are forced to take drastic measures – like stealing jumbo jets and conversing with crazy government conspiracists (Woody Harrelson in the film’s funniest role).\n\nEmmerich, who co-wrote the script with Harald Kloser, pretty much plays the same scene over and over, as Cusack, Peet, McCarthy and their bed-wetting brats escape calamity after calamity, always in the nick of time.\n\nThe only thing that differs are the locations, as the story hopscotches from India to Washington to L.A. to Rio to Wyoming to China and Tibet. And wherever it goes, massive destruction follows.\n\nBut don’t blame Emmerich when the Earth begins to crack and shake and molten lava turns Yellowstone into Jellystone. No, blame the sun. Turns out it’s as mad as hell and it’s not going to take it anymore. So it begins emitting enough excess energy to heat our planet’s core to a temperature high enough to trigger massive earthquakes, tsunamis and highly amusing melodrama.\n\nAs is the case in all disaster movies, evolution dictates that survival is achieved not by the fittest, but the highest income, be it corporate CEOs paying a king’s ransom to board the last ship out, or the actors portraying them. Sorry, George Segal, you lose on both counts.\n\nThe big winners are those of us who prefer their disaster movies served with generous amounts of cheese and ham. And on that count, “2012” more than succeeds. And so what if it’s high in empty calories? You’re not going to be around much longer anyway.\n\nReach Al Alexander at aalexander@ledger.com."
