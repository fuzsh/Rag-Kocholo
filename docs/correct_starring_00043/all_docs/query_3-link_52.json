        "text": "In other words, which cast members are returning to the show and who’s new for season two?\n\nWho’s returning?\n\nDolores Abernathy - Evan Rachel Wood\n\nWho does Evan Rachel Wood play? Original host Dolores was one of the focal points of season one, with her journey to self-awareness becoming a central storyline in the show. Her travels with William took up most of the first series, but now she has her freedom and a thirst for revenge - so what does she have planned?\n\nWhat else has Evan Rachel Wood been in? Rachel Wood starred in the 2008 drama The Wrestler directed by Darren Aronofsky, where she played embittered wrestler Mickey Rourke’s daughter. She also starred in the George Clooney-directed political thriller The Ides of March alongside Ryan Gosling. A child actor, Rachel Wood had her first leading role aged nine in Digging to China, and attracted critical acclaim for her role as a troubled teen in 2003's Thirteen.\n\nMaeve Millay - Thandie Newton\n\nWho does Thandie Newton play? Newton plays the sentient android Maeve, the former madam of a brothel in Sweetwater who became self-aware throughout the first season of the show. She was last seen returning to the park after deciding to track down her daughter, another host who she'd lived with during her earlier years in Westworld.\n\nMore like this\n\nWhat else has Thandie Newton been in? Among other roles, the British actress has starred in the fourth series of BBC drama Line of Duty where she played DCI Roz Huntley. She was also nominated for a BAFTA for her role in the 2004 Best Picture winner Crash and is set to make an appearance in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story.\n\nBernard Lowe – Jeffrey Wright\n\nWho does Jeffrey Wright play? Wright plays the character of Bernard, the head of programming at Westworld and an artificial recreation of the park's co-creator Arnold Weber. With Anthony Hopkins’ Ford now dead, Bernard is free from his control and will likely play a pivotal role in the upcoming season.\n\nWhat else has Jeffrey Wright been in? The actor starred in the Bond films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace alongside Daniel Craig before starring with Jennifer Lawrence in the Hunger Games sequels. Wright also starred alongside Evan Rachel Wood in George Clooney’s Ides of March.\n\nTeddy Flood – James Marsden\n\nWho does James Marsden play? Flood is a good-guy host with a dark past, who spent most of his time searching for the missing Dolores in season one. Flood, like all the hosts, learns a lot about himself throughout the course of the first season, leading him to self-awareness going into season two. Expect him to be an important part of the revolution in season two.\n\nWhat else has James Marsden been in? The Oklahoma-born actor is most famous for his role as Scott Summers or Cyclops in the original X-Men movies. Marsden starred in the original trilogy of films and reprised the character for a cameo in X-Men: Days of Future Past. He has also appeared in films including Enchanted and Superman Returns.\n\nCharlotte Hale - Tessa Thompson\n\nWho does Tessa Thompson play? A large portion of season one focused on Delos, the company that owns Westworld, attempting to push out Robert Ford, the park's creator. Pivotal to this plot was Thompson’s board exec Charlotte Hale, whose attempt to remove Ford from the board led to tensions within the Westworld staff. With the hosts having risen up this season, expect Hale’s position to be particularly treacherous.\n\nWhat else has Tessa Thompson been in? Thompson starred in the Ava DuVernay-directed Selma before her breakout role in the Rocky sequel Creed. More recently, she was seen starring as the drunken warrior Valkyrie in last year's Thor: Ragnarok alongside Chris Hemsworth, and in Netflix sci-fi Annihilation with Natalie Portman.\n\nWilliam - Jimmi Simpson\n\nWho does Jimmi Simpson play? Simpson stars as William, the younger version of The Man in Black. William begins his time at Westworld as a moral and conscientious visitor, but as time passes he becomes more selfish, violent and obsessed with the park's hosts. William takes a particular shine to Dolores, leading to his older self’s villainous actions.\n\nWhat else has Jimmi Simpson been in? Simpson is known for his recurring role in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia where he plays the strange and hilarious Liam McPoyle, and as a hacker in Netflix series House of Cards. More recently, Simpson starred in the acclaimed USS Callister episode of the satirical anthology Black Mirror on Netflix, and was nominated for a BAFTA for his performance.\n\nThe Man in Black – Ed Harris\n\nWho does Ed Harris Play? Harris plays the older incarnation of William, known in the Westworld park as The Man in Black. The Man in Black has a sadistic nature, often wishing the park's \"games\" were more challenging, and ended season one gleefully anticipating the hosts' attack.\n\nWhat else has Ed Harris been in? Harris has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars three times for his roles in Apollo 13, The Truman Show and The Hours. He also starred in the science fiction film Snowpiercer and the 2017 thriller Mother! among many other performances.\n\nAshley Stubbs – Luke Hemsworth\n\nWho does Luke Hemsworth play? Stubbs is the head of security at Westworld, and considering the hosts rebelled at the end of season one he'll probably be pretty busy in the new season. Stubbs was abducted by hosts in his last appearance, and it's assumed the new episodes will reveal how he escaped.\n\nWhat else has Luke Hemsworth been in? Before being cast in Westworld, Hemsworth starred in the Australian soap Neighbours. More recently he cameoed as the God of Thunder in Thor: Ragnarok, where he played a fictionalised version of the role his brother Chris made famous during a scene in the film.\n\nHector Escaton – Rodrigo Santoro\n\nWho does Rodrigo Santoro play? Hector is an outlaw within Westworld who is wanted for multiple massacres within the park. The vengeful gang leader has a close relationship with Maeve and is one of the hosts bent on survival in the new season.\n\nWhat else has Rodrigo Santoro been in? Santoro played the role of Xerxes I in the swords and sandals epic 300, before starring as Jesus in the 2016 remake of Ben-Hur. The Brazilian actor also starred in the 2003 romantic comedy Love Actually, where he played the role of Karl opposite Laura Linney, and Lost.\n\nLee Sizemore - Simon Quarterman\n\nWho does Simon Quarterman play? Quarterman stars as the narrative director of the park responsible for the stories or loops that the hosts are part of. His key role in the subjugation of the hosts is likely to make him a key target during the uprising. Could his days in Westworld be numbered?\n\nWhat else has Simon Quarterman been in? The British actor had a role in the 2012 supernatural horror film The Devil Inside and has starred in many TV shows during his career, including Midsomer Murders, Holby City and EastEnders as well as the miniseries Victoria & Albert.\n\nAngela Sarafyan - Clementine Pennyfeather\n\nWho does she play?\n\nA host formerly working in Maeve's whorehouse, Clementine was lobotomised in the last series and now acts as a zombie-like lieutenant for Dolores.\n\nWhere have I seen her?\n\nThe Armenian-American played one of the Egyptian coven of vampires in the Twilight movies, and also appeared in American Horror Story as Alice.\n\nLogan – Ben Barnes\n\nWho does Ben Barnes play? In season one, Logan was a veteran guest at Westworld who indulges his darker instincts in the park's more sinister storylines. Closely connected to William/The Man in Black, expect Logan to be a key player in the story going forward.\n\nWhat else has Ben Barnes been in? Barnes starred in the The Chronicles of Narnia films Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader and a 2009 adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s classic The Picture of Dorian Gray before landing his role in Westworld.

The Norwegian actress starred in the 2014 film Hercules alongside Dwayne Johnson and also appeared in the TV movie adaptation of Terry Pratchett’s Going Postal.\n\nAngela - Talulah Riley\n\nWho does Talulah Riley play?

In season two Riley has been upgraded to a main character, and so we expect Angela will break free of her loop and join the revolution.\n\nWhat else has Talulah Riley been in?
