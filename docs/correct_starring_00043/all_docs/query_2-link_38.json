        "text": "Thandiwe Newton reclaims real name\n\nThe actress formerly known as Thandie Newton is reclaiming her real name: Thandiwe (pronounced “tan-DEE-way”). The 48-year-old actress, whose full name is Melanie Thandiwe Newton, told British Vogue that her name was misspelled in the credits of her first movie “Flirting,” co-starring Nicole Kidman, in 1991, and it stuck for 30 years. Ironically, she played a character named Thandiwe, but told the publication that she’ll be credited as Thandiwe Newton in all future projects. “That’s my name. It’s always been my name. I’m taking back what’s mine,” she told the magazine. Newton, who’s been nominated for two Golden Globes and won an Emmy Award, is known for roles in “Westworld,” “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” “Crash,” “2012,” “Mission: Impossible II,” and “The Pursuit of Happyness.”\n\n‘Loki’ trailer\n\nTom Hiddleston returns as Marvel’s God of Mischief in the first trailer for “Loki,” a new Disney+ series set after the events of “Avengers: Endgame.” The show is described as a fish-out-of-water story about Loki, who’s recruited by Owen Wilson and the TVA (Time Variance Authority) to fix reality after he stole the Tesseract. “Loki” premieres June 11 on Disney Plus.\n\n‘SNL’ highlights\n\n“Saturday Night Live” tackled recent controversies surrounding Rep. Matt Gaetz (played by Pete Davidson), Pepe Le Pew (Kate McKinnon) and Lil Nas X (Chris Redd) in a Britney Spears (Chloe Fineman) talk show skit. Other “SNL” highlights included host Daniel Kaluuya trying to convince his family to get the Covid-19 vaccine, “Weekend Update” on President Joe Biden’s new “New Deal,” a viral video apology parody, and a marketing meeting about Beanie Babies.\n\nMORE BUZZ:\n\nNew ‘Black Widow’ trailer teases Natasha’s secrets (SF)\n\nAI software writes ‘new’ Nirvana song (RS)\n\nJeezy marries Jeannie Mai (BB)\n\n‘Big Ang’ star Linda Torres dies at 62 (E!)\n\nZack Snyder shares deleted Joker ‘We Live in a Society’ clip (SF)\n\nJourney band members settle $10M lawsuit, will go ‘Separate Ways’ (BB)\n\nKevin Durant fined $50K for derogatory language with Michael Rapaport (E!)\n\n‘Bridgerton’ star Rege-Jean Page will not return for season 2 (SF)\n\nBhad Bhabie breaks OnlyFans record, earns $1M in 6 hours (BB)\n\nJustin Bieber releases surprise gospel EP on Easter (RS)\n\nRicky Martin shows off massive leg tattoo (ET)\n\n‘The Right Stuff’ canceled after 1 season on Disney+ (SF)\n\nThe Weeknd donates $1M for Ethiopia hunger relief (BB)\n\nArmie Hammer departs Broadway show (RS)\n\nZendaya voices Lola Bunny in new ‘Space Jam: A New Legacy’ (SF)\n\nJessica Simpson says she tested positive for Covid-19 (BB)"
