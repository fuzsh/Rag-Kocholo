Thandie Newton has admitted that she forgot how to act.

The actress, who stars alongside John Cusack in the big-budget blockbuster 2012, has said that she became frazzled during the filming of major action scenes.

The 37-year-old told The Mirror: "The only really big action scenes I was involved in were two water sequences - one where I'm in a corridor and this huge tidal wave comes bursting down towards us. It was amazing but I forgot to act because gallons of water were rushing down from floor to ceiling towards me.

"The director had to shout "cut" and all the water went down. I don't even know where it drained to. Then ten minutes later, we did it again and the water comes rushing round the corner, blasting down the set."

As for enjoying her time on the film's set, she added: "On 2012, when I'd finished a scene I'd go back to my trailer and just collapse. There were huge sets, lots of cameras and it was kind of exhausting."

2012 is currently playing in US and UK cinemas.
