Early Life

Melanie Thandiwe Newton was born on November 6th of 1972 in Westminster, London, England. Her mother was a princess of Zimbabwean royalty, and her father was a lab technician with English heritage. Her middle name Thandiwe later became Newton's stage name, and it means "beloved" in the Nguni language of the Bantu people.

As a young girl, Newton attended a Catholic school. Due to her race and her family's atheism, she was quickly ostracized and made to feel like an outsider. She admits that she was asked to sit out of school photos, and she was often humiliated for a number of reasons. As a young girl, Newton also studied dance in London. After graduating from secondary school, she attended Cambridge and earned a degree in social anthropology.

This film was also notable because it starred Oprah Winfrey.

In 2000, Thandie Newton worked with Tom Cruise once again in "Mission: Impossible 2," almost a decade before working with him on "Interview with the Vampire."

Her next film was "Good Deeds," and she followed up with roles in TV series like "Rogue" and "The Slap."

Thandie was singled out for praise by critics, winning a vast number of awards in recognition of her performance. In 2018, she booked the role of Val in the film "Solo: A Star Wars Series," which is widely considered to be one of the worst Star Wars films of all time.
