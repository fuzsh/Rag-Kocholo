And that’s not including all the TV series Netflix picks up from broadcast and cable networks. Below is our regularly updated guide to the 50 best shows on Netflix in the United States. Each recommendation comes with a secondary pick, too, for 100 suggestions in all. (Note: Netflix sometimes removes titles without notice.)\n\nWe also have lists of the best movies on Netflix, Max and Amazon Prime Video, along with the best TV and movies on Hulu and Disney+\n\n‘A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder’ (2024)\n\nBased on a series of young adult mystery novels by Holly Jackson, this charming and poignant coming-of-age drama stars Emma Myers as Pip, a somewhat sheltered British schoolgirl who investigates the death of a popular classmate. As she awkwardly plays detective, Pip learns more about the secret lives of her peers and neighbors, and slowly begins to realize how little she really understands about the world. According to our critic, the show’s real intrigue is “not its mystery, really, but how much Pip truly does grow and change before our very eyes.” (Netflix’s kooky adaptation of Giovanni Boccaccio’s influential 14th century story collection “The Decameron” is another tale of people learning about themselves by stepping outside their usual social boundaries.)\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n‘Your Honor’ (2020-23)\n\nBryan Cranston plays the ethically compromised New Orleans judge Michael Desiato in this crime thriller, which features an outstanding supporting cast that includes Michael Stuhlbarg, Hope Davis, Carmen Ejogo, Rosie Perez and Isiah Whitlock Jr. When Desiato’s son gets involved in a hit-and-run accident — where the victim is the son of a prominent mob family — the judge’s attempted cover-up quickly gets messy, with each illicit act necessitating another, putting his family in further danger. Our critic said of Cranston, “He’s attuned to every micro-flash of emotion in Desiato — grief, anger, panic, determination — and lets us see every mental adjustment he makes to knit his story together faster than it can unravel.” (For another twisty and pulpy crime series, watch “Prison Break.”)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
