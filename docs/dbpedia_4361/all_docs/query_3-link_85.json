They do this in order to keep their old subscribers around and entice new ones into signing up. But no matter how exciting these additions may be, there are far too many services for any of us to subscribe to them all. Thankfully, paid services aren’t the only choices — many free alternatives have started popping up all over. One of the best options is The Roku Channel, and the service is adding a bunch of free movies to its library in February.\n\nThe Roku Channel added 27 new movies back in January, including Back to the Future, Taxi Driver, and Hook. Another 29 movies will join the library in February. Some highlights are American Hustle, Moneyball, The Hurt Locker, and Punch-Drunk Love.\n\nThey are all free to watch on The Roku Channel. You can access The Roku Channel on nearly any smart device. The service is also available online at TheRokuChannel.com.\n\nIn addition to on-demand movies and shows, The Roku Channel also features a number of live channels.
