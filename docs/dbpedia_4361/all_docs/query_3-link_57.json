Monfort Street, Greensburg, to be utilized as a storage and rehearsal space pending a performance space.\n\nExactly 27 years later, the TCP Board toured the former Wesleyan Church at 634 W. Main Street, Greensburg, and found it appropriate for a community playhouse.\n\nDuncan spearheaded a capitol campaign to purchase the building, and the rest is history.\n\nTree County Players 2024-2025 season offers something for everyone with several community partnerships.\n\n—Mystery at the Museum: Murder at the Manor (community partnership with the Historical Society of Decatur County), September 6 to 8. Directed by Karen Matthews and Lauren Huffmeyer.\n\n—Almost, Maine, October 3 to 5. Directed by Megan Gehrich and Rocky Miano. Written by John Cariani, Almost, Maine is a series of nine short plays surrounding love and relationship dynamics, specifically the sadness and hilarity of love.\n\n—Front and Center Players: Variety Show (community partnership with The ARC of Decatur County), November 1 and 2. Directed by Jennifer Maddux, Carrie Shumaker and Bryan Collins.\n\n—A Merry Country Christmas, December 6 and 7. Directed by Dennis Fogle.\n\n—Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, February 6 to 9. Directed by Jeff Lincourt. As news spreads of a murder in London, a group of seven strangers finds itself snowed in at a remote countryside guesthouse. When a police sergeant arrives, the guests discover, to their horror, that a killer is in their midst. One by one, the suspicious characters reveal their sordid pasts.\n\n—Feldman Music Studio: Student Showcase (community partnership with Feldman Music Studio), April 12. Directed by Willie Feldman.\n\n—MTI's Raise Your Voice: A Youth Musical Theater Revue, June 12 to 15. Directed by Amy Borns and Morgan Straber.\n\n—TCP's Youth Theater Camp, July 23 to 25.
