He’s exceeded his own expectations as he continues to thrive in the comedy arena, as he still basks in the success of his critically acclaimed comedy special Chappelle's Home Team - Earthquake: Legendary for Netflix lauded by the New York Times as the funniest comedy special of that year.\n\nEarthquake made his way into the households and hearts of his loyal fanbase in the 90’s at the height of television programming for the urban comedian. Shows like BET’s Comic View, HBO’s Def Comedy Jam, glimpses of Laffapalooza and Shaq’s All-Star Comedy Jam became fan favorites. Earthquake’s DVD collection of comedy specials made him the stand-out comedic talent of that era. Those specials include, About Got Damm Time, Walter Latham Presents, From the Outhouse to the Whitehouse and These Ain’t Jokes for Showtime.\n\nAs a result, his presence on the comedy circuit added a relatable and celebrated point of view that resonated with thousands of fans, and he found his sweet spot-on numerous tours and club dates. Never leaving a fan disappointed, ‘Quake’ (as he is affectionately known), quickly became a closer or multi-headliner fixture on some of the biggest tours in the country.\n\nIn addition to the television talk show circuit and digital platforms, Comedian Earthquake has been featured on primetime television as well. Notably, his first real look as a recurring character was as the beloved ‘Uncle Mike’ from the hit sitcom, ‘Everybody Hates Chris’. He then enjoyed a string of special appearances and more recurring roles including Bounce Network’s, ‘In the Cut’, ‘Rel’ for Fox Television, and HBO Max’s ‘South Side’. Most recently Quake is enjoying recurring roles on CBS’ ‘The Neighborhood’ starring Cedric the Entertainer and preparing for the third season of the breakout hit series, ‘Johnson’ for the Bounce network which had garnered over five-million views per episode in its first season. Additionally, Earthquake can also be spotted on HBO Max series entitled, Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.\n\nEarthquake has enjoyed the film arena as well. His film credits include animated favorite ‘Barnyard’, ‘Something Like a Business’ with Kevin Hart, ‘Getting Played’ with Vivica Fox, Ice Cube’s ‘The Longshots’ and the Kevin Smith cult classic ‘Clerks II’ with a recent appearance in Mario Van Peebles indie-project, ‘Armed’, and a new film project entitled ‘Bed-Ridden’, for which he nabbed the leading role.\n\nAs an extension of his film work, Quake has provided voicing for the ‘Barnyard’ film made-for-television program ‘Back at the Barnyard’ for Nickelodeon and voicing for global brands Nike and Beats by Dre respectively.\n\nIf all of this were not enough, Earthquake hails as the host of his uber-popular radio show Quake’s House for Kevin Hart’s Laugh Out Loud Network which is housed on Sirius XM Channel 96. Celebrating its fifth season, Quake’s House airs Monday through Thursday and is the quintessential house of funny. The chat ranges from current events to the man-women complexities of romantic life and people tune in to hear Quake’s off-the-cuff banter and celebrity drop-ins.\n\nPresently, Earthquake is filming various projects and preparing for his new comedy special. A Washington D.C native resides in Los Angeles and continues to sell out rooms on the comedy circuit, on nationwide tours and remains a favorite among top-tier stand-up comedy talent. As he enjoys arguably the biggest year of his career, Quake will continue to make television appearances giving his fans glimpses of his work on popular programming.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nIn 2008, Sidney took his first steps onto the comedy stage in Phoenix, marking the beginning of an illustrious career that would leave audiences in stitches across the nation.

It was during one of his lowest points he began to pray to God and surrender his life to Him. It was at this moment his Spiritual Awakening began. Things started to happen that did not make sense. He started to hear, see and feel things that were “not of this world.” Teachers showed up out of nowhere, making it seem as if he was on a divinely guided path which contained some sort of predestined plan. Anthony was told he was a psychic medium, and so began his development with Spirit.\n\nAnthony bridges the gap between the living and the deceased. He can hear, feel and see souls on the other side to bring you the closure you may need from your loved ones.\n\nYou can find Anthony on the road doing live events throughout the country or at home in NJ doing private readings and mentoring students.

With all due respect to the late James Brown.\n\nHofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' \"Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson\", Showtime's \"White Boyz in the Hood\", VH1's \"Countdown\", Sundance's \"On the Road in America\", and ABC's \"Barbara Walter's Special\", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of \"Laughs\" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally.\n\nOne of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan.\n\nAfter hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers.

His third album (\"Dark Side of the Room\") was the first ever pay-what-you-want\" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts.\n\nHofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook (still the world record), 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores.\n\nWhile Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons."
