Whether he's discussing his failed relationships, ranting about the trials and tribulations of being an unwed father, or reminiscing over the insanity that was his childhood, Myke always manages to find the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nHis ability to find the funny in any situation has made him a favorite in venues throughout the country, having been selected to perform at \"The World Series of Comedy\" in Las Vegas, NV., \"The Boston Comedy Festival\" in Sommerville, MA., and \"The Laugh Your Asheville Off Comedy Festival\" in Asheville, NC.
