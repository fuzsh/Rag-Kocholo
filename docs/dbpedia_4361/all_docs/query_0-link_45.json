        "text": "The Service Bulletin article \"Seeking a Forest Service Song\" concerns the search for an appropriate Forest Service song and has this to say: \"The Ranger Song,\" to a tune from Rio Rita, has now become identified with the Forest Service in the minds of thousands throughout the country through its use for more than a year as the signature song for the radio drama, \"Uncle Sam's Forest Rangers.\" It is a lively addition to our repertory. But since it is used with music from a popular musical comedy, we can not claim it exclusively as our own.\" (Forest Service, Service Bulletin, vol. 17, no. 8, April 10, 1933, p. 4-5)\n\nAn earlier article states: \"Several requests have been received from radio listeners for the words to the Forest Rangers' song used weekly as a signature piece with the \"Uncle Sam's Forest Rangers\" program. The song was \"swiped\" from the musical comedy \"Rio Rita,\" and with the connivance of the National Broadcasting Company, Uncle Sam's Forest Rangers appropriated it for their own. Since many members of the Forest Service might also like to know the words, they are given herewith.\"\n\nForest Rangers' Song\n\nWhen we rangers ride the trail / In sunshine, wind or snow or hail\n\nWe're always ready / We're true and steady.\n\nThere's a friendly laugh, a joke, / We're cheery until we see a smoke,\n\nAnd then we'll fight, sir, / To get it right, sir.\n\nWe never leave a fire till no spark is to be seen;\n\nOur job's to guard the timber, keep the forest green.\n\nchorus:\n\nWe're all pals together, /Comrades, birds of a feather\n\nRootin' pals, tootin' pals, / Ridin' pals, fightin' pals.\n\nIn rain or sunshine.\n\nPals! Say there brother, / Pull for each other --\n\nAlways play the game, fight the flame\n\nFor we all belong to the Forest Rangers\n\nMan to man.\n\n(from Service Bulletin, vol. 16, no. 23, June 6, 1932)\n\nOur mimeographed copy of the following song has a handwritten note that says, \"I don't know why or when the name was changed to \"The Lucky Ranger.\" Originally just \"Ranger's Song.\"\" (Sorry, we don't know who the \"I\" is!)\n\nThe Lucky Ranger\n\nby P.S. Lovejoy\n\n(tune: Johnnie and Frankie)\n\nO once there was a ranger / Who always did his best\n\nHe wore the Service uniform / And a badge upon his vest\n\nHe had no interest / Save in his forest.\n\nHe had his breakfast early / Two hours before daylight\n\nHe hit the trail at sun-up / And kept it up till night\n\nAnd half the night / He'd read and write.\n\nO he was in demand / When trouble was in sight\n\nFor he could run a Whizzer / And he could also fight\n\nHell or high water / It was all right.\n\nHis pride was that he knew / His work from A to Z\n\nFrom Abies to zylem / The Manual and sub E\n\nAnd every part / He knew by heart\n\nHis mind was automatic / He never liked debate\n\nHe never hesitated / And never was too late\n\nHe could not make / A mistake.\n\nHe thought the world was skookum / But asked two things from life\n\nThat he should own a forest / And that he find a wife\n\nFor to marry / Was necessary.\n\nOne day a tourist's daughter / Got lost out in the brush\n\nThe 'phoned in to the Ranger / And he was there with a rush\n\nThey needn't worry / For he would hurry.\n\nHe tracked her down a canyon / And up a mountain side\n\nAnd if he hadn't found her / She certainly would have died\n\nBut she was plucky / And that was lucky.\n\nFor when the ranger saw her / A great big grizzly bear\n\nHad run her up on a pile of rocks / And he was a-keeping her there\n\nAnd now the Ranger / Was in great danger.\n\nBut the Ranger ran right up / And pulled his forty-five\n\nAnd the air turned blue with the smoke of it / But the bear was still alive\n\nThe fighting / Was exciting.\n\nThe Ranger's guns were empty / So he pulled his Bowie knife\n\nFor the bear was coming for him / And he had to save his life\n\nAnd for a fight / That was all right.\n\nBut the Ranger he was losing / For he didn't have the weight\n\nThe girl saw things were desperate And she was most too late\n\nBut she was coming / And coming running.\n\nThe bear was bleeding badly / But the Ranger was all in\n\nWhen the bear hit him an awful smash / And it looked just like a win\n\nBut in a clem / Cherche la femme.\n\nThe bear reached for the Ranger / Who had fainted with the shock\n\nWhen the girl ran a hairpin down his ear / And beaned him with a rock\n\nThe with the knife / She took his life.\n\nThe Ranger's leg was broken / But they had to get outside\n\nSo the girl she carried him fifteen miles / And all the way she cried\n\nFor she was sad / And also glad.\n\nShe nursed the ranger well / And then one moonlight night\n\nHe said, \"My dear, I love you / You certainly can fight\n\nYou saved my life / Please be my wife.\"\n\n\"O yes indeed\", she answered / \"But you certainly were slow\n\nI'd rather marry a Ranger / Than any man I know\n\nAnd I'd rather marry you / Than carry you.\"\n\n\"But we will have to wait, dear / For a while at least I fear\n\nFor I have no Ranger Station / And it may take me a year\n\nThe Supervisor / Is a miser.\"\n\n\"No! I can't wait so long / And anyway don't you care\n\nWe will get married tomorrow / For Pa is a millionaire\n\nPick out your forest / And get the best.\"\n\nWell he thought of the old Uinta / And the Routt and the Medicine Bow\n\nThe Blackfeet and the Coeur d'Alene / The Crook and the Durango\n\nBut they all had / Too blamed much snow.\n\nHe thought of the Uncompahgre / The Gila and the Kern\n\nThe Modoc and the Klamath / But he was afraid they'd burn\n\nAnd also / The Ochoco.\n\nHe wanted to make certain / There should be no mistake\n\nSo he took a trip to the Kootenai / And then to the Fishlake\n\nAnd the Lolo / And the Mono.\n\nThe Leadville was too high / The Kansas was too low\n\nSo he passed up all of District Two / And still was on the go\n\nTo look still more / Became a chore.\n\nBut he said, \"I am a Ranger / And the forest is my home\n\nI must find one that suits me / And until then I must roam\n\nIt will be fun / To own one.\"\n\nHe went to the Pacific / And climbed up Mount Ranier\n\nHe looked around all Puget Sound / And then he said \"I fear\n\nThat each is rainier / Than Ranier.\"\n\nThe Datil was too dry / The Chelan was too wet\n\nThe Inyo was awful dry / The Chugach wetter yet\n\nIn melancholy / He slipped his trolley.\n\nYear after year he wandered / Till he forgot his wife\n\nTo find a perfect forest / He gave up all his life\n\nHe never knew that / He could not do that.\n\n(pitch in minor)\n\nOut in the scaler's cabins / Nights when the wind is high\n\nThe Scalers tell each other / \"There's that Ranger goin' by\n\nPoor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nDays when the fires are working / And there isn't any sky\n\nAnd there is no grub or water / They here him goin' by\n\n\"Poor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nNoons when the crew finds water / And the cigaretts are made\n\nThey damn their job and the party chief / But they do not want to trade\n\n\"Poor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nUp at the Lookout Station / With his heliograph and phone\n\nThe Lookout talks to the Guards below / And they say \"He's all alone\n\nPoor cuss / He envies us.\"\n\nWhen the Beartrap District Ranger / Meets up with the one below\n\nThey damn the Supervisor / But they let the other know\n\n\"Poor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nWhen the Utah Supervisor / Meets one from District Three\n\nThey damn the District Foresters / But in this they agree\n\n\"Poor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nWhen the District Heads foregather / To hear the Big Chief tell\n\nWhat they have next to tend to / They all think \"Go to hell\n\nBut the poor cuss / He's worse off than us\"\n\n(back to major)\n\nThe Swartzwald suits the German / The Zielwald suits the Swiss\n\nThe Brittish like the Punjab / And it all comes down to this\n\n\"Poor cuss / Worse off than us.\"\n\nAnd some folks like the hardwoods / And some prefer the pine\n\nand some folks like the mixed woods / And I like spruce in mine\n\n\"My forest / Is always best.\"\n\nAnd some folks like forests level / And some prefer them rough\n\nAnd some want a little and some want lots / And each is good enough\n\n\"My forest / Is always best.\""
