He started hitting stages two weeks after 9/11, so he understands the importance of lightness in dark times—not that these are dark times—everything’s great! (Fearful Face Emoji...) He has a wide range of external targets for his misdirection but is also not afraid to put himself on blast. He has produced and hosted a variety of comedy showcases in LA so he’s no stranger to taking the bullet and loves to get the party started. He is featured on First Nations Comedy Experience on Amazon, a showcase for indigenous comics. His father, Martin Fierro, a gifted saxophonist who played with The Grateful Dead and many other bands, was Apache and Tarahumara. His mom is a New York Jew.

In 2022, Chalepah obtained her MFA in Creative Writing from the Institute of American Indian Arts.\n\nIn addition, she is a mother of four, a cat mom, and a member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma.
