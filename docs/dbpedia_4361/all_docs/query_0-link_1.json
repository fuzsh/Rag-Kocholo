        "meta_description": "When Mac (Jerry O'Connell) goes to the northwestern Montana wilderness to join the National Forest Service as a ranger in 1919, he is little more than a cocksure 17-year-old, but his tough-as-nails boss, Bill Bell (Sam Elliott), sees to it that he becomes a man. Since Bell has a reputation for being the best ranger, Mac wants nothing more than to follow in his idol's footsteps -- though it often leads to some missteps. As time passes, the two develop a friendship, but Mac has much to learn.",
