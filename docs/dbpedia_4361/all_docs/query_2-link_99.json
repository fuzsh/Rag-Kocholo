        "text": "Get Your Teenagers Excited About St. Louis\n\nTravel can enhance a teenager’s self-esteem, education and worldview, but it’s not always easy to find activities that appeal to them. We’re here to help with that.\n\nThese St. Louis attractions will challenge teens physically and mentally, give them freedom to explore on their own and introduce them to interesting people.\n\nMost teenagers’ moods also depend on how well they sleep and eat. Check out our recommendations for places to stay and places to eat in the St. Louis area and start your trip off on the right foot.\n\nJump to:\n\nEntertainment Complexes\n\nAt Amp Up Action Park, there’s guaranteed fun at every turn. Zip around a custom-built track in the most technologically advanced indoor kart in the world and complete a heart-pounding adventure in the three-level, black light-lit laser tag arena. There’s also an elevated ropes course, axe throwing, arcade games and pickleball. Play as you go or purchase a two-hour pass, and when you get hungry, stop by the Filling Station Cafe or Trackside Tavern for bar bites, pizza, sweet treats and more.\n\nArmory STL, a new entertainment complex in Midtown, is massive – and we’re not exaggerating. The venue has almost 6 acres of flexible indoor space, where everyone in your group will find an activity that they enjoy. Armory STL boasts the largest indoor TV screen in Missouri, a state-of-the-art sound system, arcade games and other activities such as cornhole, table tennis and four-square badminton. There are also putting greens, adult seesaws and a bright-green, two-story slide. Hungry? The kitchen serves up delectable dishes such as the spicy bacon and egg burger with crispy shallots and Sriracha mayonnaise; the brat, apple and Cheddar press with caramelized onions; veggie tacos with roasted sweet potato, black beans, avocado, pickled onion and avocado-yogurt sauce; a pulled pork chip board; and creamy garlic wings. For those 21 and older, there’s approximately 500 feet of bar space where you can order your drink of choice. Overall, the vibe is fun and casual, and entrance is free.\n\nHoused in the 100-year-old Century Electric Co. factory in Midtown, City Foundry is a buzzing hangout that features a European-style food hall populated by chef-driven restaurants and unique boutiques filled with locally made products. The site also includes Alamo Drafthouse and Puttshack. “Not another multiplex,” the former aims to preserve the film-watching experience. It boasts 10 screens and more than 930 luxury recliners, along with a full bar and local food specials – think St. Louis-style pizza, toasted ravioli and gooey butter cake. From the makers of Topgolf, the latter modernizes mini golf with patented technology, Instagram-friendly aesthetics and world-class cuisine. Sandbox, a futuristic, full-body, virtual-reality experience, is another entertainment option at City Foundry. Inspired by Star Trek’s Holodeck, Sandbox’s original worlds will make you feel like you’re living inside a game or a movie.\n\nFor unlimited fun under one roof, head to Main Event in Chesterfield. From bowling to laser tag and billiards to mini golf, every activity and game is designed to bring family and friends together. You can also play arcade games, immerse yourself in a virtual reality experience, test your skills on the indoor ropes course and show off your smarts in one of the miniature escape rooms. If you’re in the area on Monday, take advantage of Main Event’s all-you-can-play promotion – it’s just $12.99 a person!\n\nRecreational Activities\n\nTake flight at Adventure Valley, where 10 zip lines will propel you through a beautiful, wooded ridge in Jefferson County. On one zip line, which is more than 1,100 feet long, you can reach speeds up to 50 miles per hour! If you would rather keep your feet on the ground, Adventure Valley also has a paintball park, which is open on Saturdays and Sundays for those 12 and older. Don’t underestimate how fun it can be to team up with your loved ones and play in a paintball tournament.\n\nNeed a good read? Apotheosis Comics & Lounge has some of the best comic books and graphic novels for teenagers on its shelves. The locally owned and operated specialty bookstore also hosts events such as game nights, comedy shows and literary discussions.\n\nIs it safe to paddle the Mighty Mississippi? Big Muddy Adventures, a world-class St. Louis-based adventure company, is often asked that question, and the answer is a resounding yes. The professional outfitter provides access to the wild wonders of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers with its full fleet of canoes and kayaks. Whether you want to do a microadventure in downtown St. Louis, embark on a full moon float to a beautiful, uninhabited river island or add a bike ride along the Katy Trail to your aquatic adventure, river trips with Big Muddy Adventures are always memorable.\n\nConcentration, creativity and collaboration. Perception, patience and persistence. Your team will need these skills to break out of Escape Challenge St. Louis, where ordinary rooms are turned into engaging mysteries. Perfect for problem-solvers aged 12 and older, the scenarios are specifically designed to give guests a unique escape experience. So, gather your group and see if you can beat one of the high scores.\n\nGrab your balls – we’re going bowling! Flamingo Bowl, the bowling mecca of downtown St. Louis, features Art Deco décor, colorful designs and a vibrant atmosphere that even teenagers find fun. The lounge also serves late-night eats such as toasted ravioli, pretzel bites, tacos and pizza to keep them happy.\n\nBelieve it or not, St. Louis has a thriving ski scene. Located in Wildwood, approximately 30 miles west of downtown St. Louis, Hidden Valley is a winter playground for adventure-seekers from near and far. The resort has two peaks and 16 trails as well as state-of-the-art snowmaking machines to create the perfect base when Mother Nature has warmer plans. Ski and snowboard rentals are available, and Hidden Valley also boasts the largest snow-tubing hill in Missouri. The Polar Plunge Tubing Park offers guests an opportunity to soar down the snowy hill without a care in the world.\n\nWe’ll spare you the bowling puns, and get straight to the point: Pin-Up Bowl is fun at any age. Now owned by Washington University in St. Louis, the intimate bowling lounge in the Delmar Loop is filled with bowling memorabilia and 1940s pin-up girl collectibles. Monday through Sunday, it’s open until the wee hours of the morning, and Tuesday through Saturday, the kitchen keeps cooking until 2 a.m.\n\nWater slides, wave pools and lazy rivers – Raging Rivers WaterPark is a kid’s paradise and the perfect place to cool off if you’re visiting St. Louis during summer. Send your teenagers sailing down the Mississippi Monster, Cascade Body Flumes and Swirlpool and then relax in a rented cabana with an ice-cold drink.\n\nFor the best views of the Gateway Arch and St. Louis’ working riverfront, climb aboard one of the Gateway Arch Riverboats. Both the Becky Thatcher and the Tom Sawyer are 19th-century replicas, transporting you to a time when steamboats ruled the river. Cruises are narrated by captains from the National Park Service, who bring the history of the Mississippi River to life. Whether you choose a one-hour day cruise or a two-hour dinner cruise, you’ll learn about the river’s role in the country’s history as well as its impact on St. Louis’ economy to this day.\n\nOpen since September 2021, RYZE Adventure Park in Maryland Heights offers more than 100 obstacles, plus a heart-stopping zipline and a death-defying free fall, on its four-story Adventure Tower. Are you up for the challenge? The Adventure Tower isn’t linear, so you can make your own course, picking and choosing the activities and obstacles that you want to do. If you would rather keep your feet on the ground, check out the 18-hole state-of-the-art miniature golf course, which glows with neon lights at night. RYZE also has a spacious covered patio with a TV – that’s usually showing a St. Louis sporting event – and a large, turfed area where you can play yard games such as cornhole, washers and giant Jenga.\n\nEverybody scream! Six Flags St. Louis boasts nine exhilarating rollercoasters (six steel and three wooden) with more than 22,000 feet of combined track. Located in Eureka, the amusement park continues to add attractions, appealing to thrill-seekers of all ages. Need to cool off? Head to Hurricane Harbor, a waterpark inside Six Flags St. Louis, where you can experience zero gravity on the Typhoon Twister, compete for first place on the Wahoo Racer and set sail on Gulley Washer Creek.\n\nBesides the glorious collection of books that it holds, the St. Louis Public Library – Central Library offers unparalleled beauty through a masterful blend of classical and modern architectural styles. Built in 1912, the flagship spans an entire city block, standing proudly as a monument to the past and a cultural beacon for the future. Throughout the year, the library hosts art exhibitions and other events, such as Teen Video Game Night, and if you have time, you can join one of the architectural tours to learn more about the exquisite examples of both Beaux-Arts and Neoclassical architecture at the library.\n\nTo warm up in the winter, both shaky skaters and seasoned professionals enjoy taking laps around Steinberg Skating Rink. Situated in the sprawling acreage of Forest Park, it’s the largest outdoor skating rink in the Midwest. After you glide around the festively lit venue, snuggle up with hot chocolate by a fire pit.\n\nFore! Topgolf has two locations in the St. Louis area – one in Midtown and one in Chesterfield – where you can perfect your swing in climate-controlled hitting bays. Using complimentary clubs, take aim at the giant outfield targets and let the high-tech balls score themselves. At the end of the day, it’s not about your swing or your score, though; it’s about having fun with people you love.\n\nLet’s roll. Fun, food and drinks await! Open for more than 50 years, Tropicana Lanes remains one of the top bowling destinations in the Midwest, and on weekdays, you can bowl as much as you want for $15 a person.\n\nReady, set, go! At Victory Raceway, the electric go-karts reach speeds up to 45 miles per hour on the indoor racetrack. There are no two-seaters, though – everyone drives!\n\nGreat Outdoors\n\nSprawling across almost 300 acres of pristine farmland, nestled among rolling hills and spotted with glistening lakes, Brookdale Farms offers an abundance of adventures no matter the season. Explore a flourishing maze of sunflowers, pick homegrown pumpkins or show off your ice skating skills. Brookdale Farms also offers canoe, kayak, raft and inner tube rentals so that you can experience the magic of Missouri rivers on a float trip – a summer rite of passage for locals and visitors alike.
