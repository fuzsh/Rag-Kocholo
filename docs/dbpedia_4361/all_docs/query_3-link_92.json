        "text": "The heartbeat of American country music and a beacon of Southern hospitality, Nashville is a charming city that has a lot to offer. From its world-renowned music scene to its delicious food, there’s something for everyone in Music City.\n\nInfamous for its tantalizing Southern fare, with a reputation for some rather wild partying (looking at you, Printers Alley), contrasted by a long and rich history, and you’ll find that the Tennessee capital can deliver a smorgasbord of activities to keep you entertained.\n\nFrom the ever-buzzing Downtown area to the quieter neighborhoods that line the Cumberland River, Nashville delivers a far more diverse experience than its music-centric reputation might have you believe.\n\nOutside of the infamous music scene, adventure and nature lovers can rejoice; the Tennessee State capital is within striking distance of some of the most picturesque hiking trails and outdoor adventure activities in the area – from the Cheatham Wildlife Management Area and Harpeth River State Park on the west to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a few hours drive east, there’s plenty of opportunities to get off the beaten path and explore.\n\nThrow in independent museums (The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Johnny Cash Museum are both quintessential), a slew of galleries, and the world-renowned Grand Ole Opry, and you’ve got the makings of a perfect city break.\n\nCountry music enthusiast or not, Nashville is sure to charm and surprise you with its unique blend of history, culture, food, and fun. So whether you’re on the hunt for adventure, food, music, or moonshine, as you’ll quickly find out, there’s by no means a shortage of diverse things to do in Nashville.\n\n1 – Kickstart your trip with a street-art tour\n\nAs a city that oozes artistic talent and creativity, it’s no surprise that Nashville is home to a vibrant and ever-growing street art scene. And what better way to explore it than with an in-the-know local leading the way and showing off all of the city’s hidden gems?\n\nWhether you jump on an open-aired golf buggy, wander by foot, or combine the two, with several different companies offering tours through hipster districts like East Nashville, you’re sure to get your fill of stunning murals, graffiti art, and Instagram-worthy backdrops (including the iconic WhatLiftsYou Wings Mural).\n\nAnd while East Nashville is, without doubt, brimming with the best street art in the city, don’t limit yourself to just one area – other districts such as Germantown (very walkable, and with a fabulous foodie scene to boot) and 12South are also home to some incredible pieces that are sure to light up the social media feed.\n\nNot only is it a great way to explore the city and learn about its vibrant arts scene, but it’s also a whole lot of fun! And with most tours lasting between 2 and 3 hours, it’s the perfect activity for a sunny afternoon.\n\nstreet art tours in Nashville\n\n2 – Step inside the incredible Ryman Auditorium\n\nIf country music is Nashville’s soul, then the Ryman is the ‘Mother Church of Country Music’. This iconic concert venue was first opened in 1892 and has seen some of the biggest names in music grace its stage, including the likes of Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Garth Brooks, and Billie Holiday.\n\nRyman Auditorium tickets\n\nA tour of this historic building is a must for any music lover, with guided tours taking you through the auditorium itself as well as sharing stories and anecdotes about the people who have graced its stage.\n\nYou’ll also get to see the dressing rooms, green room, and some of the iconic memorabilia on display, arguably none more famous than Dolly Parton’s dazzling rhinestone-studded jacket that she wore during her legendary 1973 performance.\n\nDon’t miss the on-site museum either; showcasing 125 years of history (including its era as the home of the Grand Ole Opry), the immersive attraction uses a rare and captivating mix of special effects, holograms, and archival footage to present country music stars including Darius Rucker and Shery Crow. Even if country music isn’t your thing, thanks to the auditorium’s architecture and rich history, a tour of the Ryman is sure to be a highlight of any trip to Nashville.\n\nAnd, obviously, don’t forget the roster of live shows! With events almost every night, simply check the calendar to see who’s gracing the stage during your stay.\n\nRyman Auditorium tours\n\n3 – Get a taste of Nashville on a food tour\n\nNosh in Nashville will make your mouth water — it’s just a fact. The Southern state prides itself on its delectable slow-roasted barbecue and hot chicken, as well as local beers and signature cocktail: the Bushwater!\n\nBut those are just the tip of the iceberg. Dig a little deeper and you’ll discover a melting pot of culinary influences, from Cajun and Creole to Italian and Mexican – and, of course, no shortage of Southern comfort food.\n\nThe best way to sample all that Nashville’s culinary scene has to offer is on a food tour, which will not only introduce you to some of the city’s best eats but also give you a behind-the-scenes look at how they’re made.\n\nFrom learning about the history of hot chicken and sampling some of the city’s best at Hattie B’s or Prince’s (depending on the tour) to indulging in a sweet treat or two (or three) on the Downtown dessert crawl (keep room for a scoop at Mattheessen’s), there’s a tour to suit every taste.\n\nOne of the big drawing cards of a locally-led food tour; besides stopping into a handful of the fan-favorite eateries (and passing by quintessential landmarks like the capitol building, Cumberland River, Germantown, and Nissan Stadium along the way), friendly guides will show you the low-key stops that only the locals know about.\n\nfood tours in Nashville\n\n4 – Make your way to the Country Music Hall of Fame\n\nPut on your cowboy hat, follow the story of country music’s humble folk roots before it shot into stardom, and find all sorts of memorabilia along the way! From Elvis’ Cadillac limousine to instruments belonging to the likes of Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood, plenty of selfie opportunities await!\n\nMoreover, the Hall of Fame – one of the world’s largest dedicated American music museums – is brimming with modern musical artifacts and interactive multimedia elements to bring the music to life. Ideal for both kids and adults, this is one place where you can easily spend an entire afternoon.\n\nThe Country Music Hall of Fame is open every day from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm, and till 6 pm on the weekends. It’s located right in the heart of SoBro, a stone’s throw from the main haints in the Arts District.\n\nSo if you’re planning on also checking out the Ryman Auditorium, the Johnny Cash Museum, the National Museum of African American Music, the Walk of Fame Park, or any of the other music-focused downtown attractions, they make for convenient back-to-back stops.\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame tickets\n\n5 – Take a memorable train trip with the Tennessee Central Railway Museum\n\nThe whistle sounds. The wheels clack. The landscape rolls by, with a beautiful machine cutting through it. There’s nothing like a train trip, and you can get a feel for it at the Tennessee Central Railway Museum, which showcases some of the finest machines of yesteryear.\n\nThis charming, volunteer-run museum is filled with remarkable memorabilia and well-preserved items from decades past. It’s especially well-known for its collection of historic railway vehicles, from engines to cargo cars to cabooses.\n\nWhile there’s a little bit of everything here, the collection specializes in cars from the “Silver Age” of recreational railway travel in the 1940s and 50s. And the best part is that you can do more than look at the trains… you can ride them!\n\nThe museum runs regular jaunts for certain holidays, including Mardi Gras, Easter, and the Christmas season. And there are plenty of other fun adventures throughout the year, from wine tastings to moonshine tours.\n\nYou can even go way back in time with a murder mystery, where your train ride becomes the chance to solve a mysterious crime, Agatha Christie style. It’s a ride on the rails that you won’t soon forget!\n\n6 – Take an insightful trolley tour through the city\n\nMost major cities around the world have those cliche double-decker red busses rolling around – the hop-on, hop-off kind that allows tourists to sightsee at their own pace. While Nashville has one of those too, it’s a far more unique, and charmingly Southern alternative: the old-school trolley.\n\nDating back to the late 1800s, these vintage-style cars offer an authentic – not to mention picturesque – way to tour the city and learn about its history and culture. And unlike other sightseeing options, you won’t have to worry about hoofing it up hills or battling for sidewalk space with fellow pedestrians.\n\nA step back in time, these green and red vehicles offer an authentic look at what public transportation used to be like. History lesson aside, by jumping onboard one of Nashville’s quaint trolleys, you’ll learn all about the city’s top attractions, landmarks, and sights.\n\nTours typically last around 90 minutes, featuring live commentary on over 100 points of interest along the way, including the State Capitol, the Hermitage (home of Andrew Jackson), Broadway, the Gulch, and more.\n\nIdeal for first-time visitors, the informative excursion is a great way to start your trip and discover the slew of things to do in Nashville. Plus, with a 20-minute stop at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park (a historic square with a regular farmers’ market), you can grab a quick snack or drink to recharge before rolling into the next neighborhood.\n\nNashville trolley tours\n\n7 – Roll a Segway through downtown Nashville\n\nFor the uninitiated, combining the fun and freedom of riding a scooter with the convenience and stability of walking, segways offer an innovative (and eco-friendly) way to explore the main haunts of Nashville without getting too exhausted in the process.\n\nBy joining one of the myriad segway tours that zoom through downtown and the surrounding areas (each with its distinct character), you can see top sights like the State Capitol, Legislative Plaza, Bridgestone Arena, Nissan Stadium (home of the Tennessee Titans), and much more.\n\nMost operators will give you a quick training session before setting off on your adventure, so even first-timers should have no problem getting the hang of things. And with small groups and knowledgeable guides, you can be sure to get the most out of your experience from an educational perspective too.\n\nWhile every tour is a little bit different, on the longer ones (roughly 2.5 hours) you can expect to cover close to 5 miles of Nashville’s highlights, covering must-see landmarks (in addition to the aforementioned) like the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Country Music Hall of Fame, Bridgestone Arena, Fort Nashborough and the Bicentennial Mall. What’s not to love?\n\nsegway tours in Nashville\n\n8 – Spot A-listers on a celebrity bus tour\n\nThe Tinseltown of the MidSouth; with deep-seated music and entertainment roots, it’s no wonder that celebrities – both homegrown and imported – often flock to Nashville. From A-listers attending the Grammy Awards or CMA Music Festival to up-and-comers filming movies and TV shows in town, there’s always a chance you might spot a celeb while strolling down Broadway or enjoying a Nashville night out.\n\nOf course, the best way to see if any celebrities are currently in town (and get a behind-the-scenes look at some of Music City’s most popular resident A-listers’ homes) is by taking a celebrity bus tour.\n\nA starpower explosion, these tourist-friendly buses will take you through the affluent neighborhoods where, if you’re lucky, you can spot the likes of Taylor Swift, Kid Rock, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, Toby Keith, and Jared Followill from Kings of Leon — just to name a few! Even if you don’t see a famous face, the chance to witness their (lavish) houses and learn about their lives in Nashville is reason enough to grab a ticket.\n\nNashville homes of the stars tours\n\n9 – Step back in time with a Civil War history excursion\n\nMusic aside, the Tennessee capital is also renowned for its role in the Civil War, with over 150 major battles and skirmishes fought in the state. A fascinating part of American history, a guided tour focusing on this period unveils the (often hard) truths about this tumultuous time, as well as the pivotal role Nashville played in the Union’s victory.\n\nExpect to see battlefields, cemeteries, monuments, and more while learning about key events like the Battle of Franklin (one of the war’s bloodiest – renowned as being the five most intense hours of the war) and President Abraham Lincoln’s visit to Nashville shortly after its fall to Union forces.\n\nAt the time, the Carter House was Federal headquarters and the Lotz House was a field hospital, both with bullet and cannonball holes in their walls until this day. Each of these houses are mainstay stops on civil war tours, with myriad stories, artifacts, and personal accounts brought to life by expert guides between each point of interest.\n\nNashville civil war tours\n\n10 – Spend the afternoon at the Tennessee State Museum\n\nLike stepping back in time – to multiple eras in this state’s loaded history – a visit to the Tennessee State Museum brings Tennessee’s rich and diverse bygone generations to life. The arguable highlight, the Tennessee Time Tunnel presents an interactive timeline that succinctly captures the region’s dramatic past, covering everything from the state’s pre-Colonial days right through to the Civil War and Reconstruction, with plenty of multimedia exhibits and old-school artifacts (like cars) to gawk at.\n\nHowever, for a different historical lens, check out the ‘Tennessee Transforms’ exhibit: through photography, fashion, technology, and music, it covers how the state has changed drastically since World War II.\n\nThrow in permanent exhibitions dedicated to First Nations, Natural History (both plants and animals), and Change and Challenge, as well as a constant roster of rotating exhibitions to complement, and you’ve got yourself one of the more educational things to do in Nashville!\n\nThe family-friendly attraction is located at the top end of the Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, right next to the Nashville Farmers’ Market. And the best part? It’s free!\n\n11 – Treat yourself to an ethereal candlelight concert with epic soundtracks in beautiful venues\n\nWhen you think of Nashville, you inevitably think of country music. But there are tons of other great genres to enjoy during a night out in the city! From John WIlliams film scores to The Nutcracker, you never know what your ears will be treated to. And with the Candlelight Concerts series, you can enjoy a venue that matches the glory of the tunes!\n\nThis popular set of events, which has become a hit in cities around the world, seeks to combine world-class musical performances with an intimate atmosphere, and the effect is truly magical.\n\nSettle into your seat surrounded by the flickering flames of hundreds of candles, as world-class musicians serenade you with gorgeous works.\n\nWhile there are lots of traditional orchestral pieces, you can also vibe to interpretations of more modern artists such as Coldplay and Beyonce. And if you’re visiting during the holidays, there are some excellent themed concerts, offering the perfect soundtrack for Christmas cheer or a cozy Valentine’s Day.\n\nBest of all, the shows take place at various venues around the city, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the historic architecture and world-class acoustics that this musical metropolis has to offer.\n\ncandlelight concerts in Nashville\n\n12 – Compete for bragging rights in an escape room!\n\nAre you ready for that “I Escaped!” feeling?

Here’s how it works: At The Escape Game, you and your team will work together to find clues, solve puzzles, and complete a mission.

As one of the earliest recording studios in Nashville, it has been used by some of music’s most prolific names, including Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, and Chet Atkins – just to name a few.\n\nMost famously, however, this little studio at 1611 Roy Acuff Place is the birthplace of the iconic ‘Nashville Sound’, instantly recognizable by its backing vocals and strings.\n\nFollow the superstars who walked the halls; the infamous artists who took country music – and Nashville – to the top.\n\nA guided tour of the studio offers visitors a behind-the-scenes look at where these legends recorded some of their most famous tracks, as well as an insight into the music recording process. As you walk the recording studios you’ll be dying to belt out a number!\n\nHot tip: Nashville is a web of musical landmarks, with every notable studio, bar, and live music venue having its own place in history. So rather than just visiting Studio B, consider a more comprehensive experience that combines a few of these iconic spots – like the Country Music Hall of Fame and Hatch Show Print – into one.\n\nRCA Studio B tours\n\n14 – Taste the iconic whiskey at Jack Daniel’s Distillery\n\nOne for the thirsty travelers (you’re on vacation, after all), a visit to Jack Daniel’s Distillery sells itself as one of the quintessential things to do in Nashville. As the oldest registered distillery in the United States (dating all the way back to 1866), a tour here is as much about the history and heritage as it is about the whiskey itself.\n\nDue to its location in Lynchburg, about an hour and a half drive south of Nashville, most people opt to take a tour as part of a day trip from the city.\n\nOn the tour, you’ll learn all about the whiskey-making process (and the difference between bourbon and whiskey), see first-hand how Jack Daniel’s is bottled and distributed, and – of course – sample a few glasses of the good stuff at the same time. Choose a tour that combines all this goodness with a BBQ lunch and some live entertainment for a day well spent.\n\nFun fact: the distillery is actually located in a dry county, so, until rather recently when laws changed, you couldn’t do a sample on-site. Fortunately for whiskey fans, that’s all changed, and not only can you taste the very best of Jack Daniel’s during your tour, but you can pop into the gift shop on site to stock up on a couple of bottles (or even your own barrel of whiskey that will get you around 240 bottles of Jack) before heading back to Nashville.\n\nJack Daniel’s Distillery tours\n\n15 – Scratch that automotive itch at the Lane Motor Museum\n\nA petrolhead paradise, the Lane Motor Museum is a must-visit for anyone with an interest in cars – and even if you don’t consider yourself a gearhead, it’s still a fascinating place to explore.\n\nWith everything from microcars and motorcycles to military vehicles and trucks on display, culminating in more than 150 vehicles in total, there’s plenty to see. And in a region that’s headstrong on Americana, this international slice of culture provides a well-appreciated change of pace.\n\nWhile the majority of the cars on show date back to pre-1960, there are also a handful of more modern vehicles dotted around the museum too.\n\nThe family-friendly attraction, which you’ll find over in South Nashville (about 15 minutes drive from downtown) makes itself unique with quirky exhibits and off-beat cars including a propeller cars exhibit, and the ‘hobby gone wild’ series which boasts peculiar vehicles you won’t find anywhere else.\n\nBoasting the title of the largest collection of European cars and motorbikes in the nation, rev-heads are quick to add this to their list of things to do in Nashville!\n\n16 – Head to the birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll on a day trip… Go walking in Memphis\n\nJust a short drive away from Nashville (about four hours), Memphis – the birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll – is the perfect day-trip destination for those looking to get off the beaten path and explore a little more of what Tennessee has to offer.\n\nThis vibrant city on the Mississippi River is best known as the home of Elvis Presley and Graceland, but there’s so much more to see and do here.\n\nWander down Beale Street – the heart and soul of Memphis’ music scene – and pop into one of the many bars and clubs that line the street, walking in the footsteps of names like Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Or learn about Memphis’ fascinating civil rights history with a trip to the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nFor something a little different, take a walk through Elmwood Cemetery, one of America’s most beautiful burial grounds, or explore the city’s unique food scene with a Memphis barbecue tour.\n\nWhatever you do, make sure to leave some time to explore Graceland, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the United States. This Elvis-themed complex includes the 14-acre mansion where The King lived, as well as his gravesite, a museum dedicated to his life and career, and even a replica of his private jets – a must-visit for any music fan.\n\nTourist tip: rather than planning your own getaway, take the stress and hassle out of the planning process by opting for a pre-planned Memphis tour from Nashville that takes care of all the logistics for you.\n\nMemphis tours from Nashville\n\n17 – Admire the gardens and sculptures at the Belmont Mansion\n\nAn iconic Italian-esque villa stepped in history and beauty, and measuring an impressive 18,000 square feet (with 36 rooms) on Nashville’s Belmont University campus (making it Tennessee’s biggest house).\n\nThe Belmont Mansion was once the summer home of wealthy slaveholding couple Adelicia and Joseph Acklen – after Joseph died, Adelicia became known as one of the wealthiest women of the antebellum South. This home is one of the rare few that follows a woman’s story.\n\nA visit to this 1850s-era home feels like stepping into a time capsule to life in Tennessee before the Civil War; with docents scattered around to tell of the history, the tour takes you through some of the most opulent rooms in the house – like Adelicia’s Bedroom, the mostly unaltered Library (featuring a 20th-century gramophone), the light and airy French-style Drawing Room, and more – with fascinating clocks scattered throughout.\n\nYou’ll also learn about the Acklen’s extraordinary lives, their philanthropy, and their roles in the slave era.\n\nThe gorgeous Italian-esque villa in its heyday boasted expansive gardens, a fine art gallery, a bowling alley, and a zoo! Today, the house hosts functions and events, so check the website to see if anything special’s on during your visit; but the main attraction remains the peaceful, sculpture-lined gardens.\n\nBelmont Mansion tours\n\n18 – Race around Nashville on an exciting scavenger hunt, checking off all the city highlights along the way\n\nFed up with those run-of-the-mill, slow-paced walking tours? Want to ditch the tourist crowds and see what the real Nashville is all about? If you consider yourself an adventurer at heart (or are just looking for a unique way to spend an afternoon), then a fast-and-furious scavenger hunt beckons.\n\nWith challenges ranging from finding local landmarks to completing fun photo tasks, solving puzzles and cracking riddles, and more, this is a far more interactive way to see the city from a whole new angle – and prove your sleuth skills in the process.\n\nNot only will you get an insider’s look at some of the city’s most popular areas (like Broadway, The Gulch, and 12South), but you’ll also discover a bounty of hidden gems that even locals don’t know about.\n\nWhile each tour is different – you can specialize in certain themes or regions if you like – most are hosted from your smartphone and battle you against the clock as you skirt your way through the city’s major drawcard.\n\nWith over 75 categories of hunts to choose from, you’ll never run out of detective options.\n\nHot tip: since you’ll be covering a lot of ground, be sure to wear comfortable shoes and come armed with plenty of water (and maybe even a snack or two).\n\nscavenger games in Nashville\n\n19 – Sign up for a private pontoon boat cruise\n\nWhile a river cruise (see #69) is always a delight, if you prefer to have a little more privacy and control over your own Nashville experience, then a private pontoon boat rental is the way to go.\n\nIdeal for anything from family gatherings and birthday celebrations to corporate events and bachelor/ette parties, these boats can come complete with their own captain so all you need to do is sit back, relax, and soak up the incredible views of the river banks downtown or the bounty of Nashville’s azure lakes (Radnor Lake, Percy Priest Lake, and Old Hickory Lake being the three main ones nearby).\n\nIf you opt for a party boat on the Cumberland River, the vessel is all yours and equipped with speakers and coolers filled with ice so you can BYO drinks and snacks. On the flip side, if you rent a boat on a lake, you’ll likely also get to organize complimentary water-sports activities for your time on the lake – think waterskiing, wakeboarding, and tubing.\n\nRegardless of how you spend your day, be that relaxing and working on the tan or quenching that thirst for thrills (or drinks), make sure to stick around for the sunset!\n\nboat tours in Nashville\n\n20 – Peruse the Picasso pieces at the Frist Art Museum\n\nThis monolithic museum on the site of Nashville’s grand ole 1930s post office, the famous Frist Art Museum is an artistic masterpiece in and of itself. Listen on the National Register of Historic Places and encompassing more than 24,000 square feet, the art museum is one of the largest in the United States.\n\nAnd it’s not just the building that’s impressive; the rotating exhibitions are top-notch too. The museum has no permanent collection, instead, it prides itself on securing the best of traveling exhibitions from around the world and bringing them to Nashville!\n\nCovering every type of theme, from thought-provoking paintings to avant-garde sculpture, historic knights in shining armor, contemporary Cuban art, medieval art, American Art Deco, British Art Nouveau, landscape paintings of the American West, and a near-endless list of everything in between.\n\nTraveling with kids in tow? Be sure to pop into Martin ArtQuest (MAQ) – the only permanent facility in the museum. Interactive and designed to get the creativity flowing, ArtQuest sports painting, drawing, and printmaking stations, a zoetrope, a shadow theater, and a stop-motion animation tool, among plenty more.\n\nFound at 919 Broadway, it sits just a 10-minute walk from the main haunts of Honky Tonk Highway – easily combined into any day of exploring Downtown and/or The Gulch.\n\n21 – Zoom down ziplines at thrilling speeds\n\nWhile Fontanel is tucked away on the northern outskirts of the city, thanks to its lush canopies, sprawling vineyards, and picturesque setting among the rolling hills of Tennessee, it feels like a world away from busy downtown Nashville, with nine ziplines that stretch up to 700 feet long and 85 feet high, spread across over 1.5 miles of glorious greenery.\n\nAmong the old forest stands Fontanel Mansion — a giant yet quaint log-cabin-style mansion that completes the scenery. While it will set you back around $20 to tour the former celebrity abode (Barbara Mandrell), as the only Nashville celebrity home that you can actually step inside, many visitors like to tag it as the cherry on top of a day of outdoor adventure.\n\nKeep in mind: if you’re ziplining with Adventureworks at Fontanel, the outdoor adventure specialists also operate another tour in Kingston Springs along the Harpeth River – just as, if not more impressive.\n\nAnd if you want to combine your zipping with some splashy fun, Nashville Shores makes an ideal vacation spot! Located just outside of town, this fun-filled complex has something for tree fans and water lovers alike.\n\nExplore the gorgeous forest canopy, and then go flying through it, with three high-octane courses to try. Along the way, you’ll get to try out some other awesome treetop adventures, including rope swings, hanging bridges, and obstacle courses.\n\nBack on the ground, you can keep your adrenaline up with the slides and wave pool at the waterpark, then settle in for the night at one of the cozy cabins on the property.\n\nzipline in Nashville\n\n22 – Go kayaking down the Cumberland River\n\nFloating or paddling downstream on the Cumberland River through downtown Nashville and ending up in the thick of Broadway is, without a doubt, a fabulously unique way to see the city.\n\nAs you wade your way along the river, you’ll be greeted to picturesque views of the Nashville skyline and Riverfront Park, where you can admire the architecture of the pedestrian bridge, the Shelby Street Bridge, the AT&T Building towering over the busy streets, and plenty more.\n\nWhile it’s easy to rent your own kayak (check out riverside haunts like River Queen Voyages or Cumberland Kayak), many travelers prefer to join a tour instead. Why?\n\nAfter meeting your guide at a pick-up point (from whom you’ll learn fascinating tidbits about the city’s history and culture), they’ll shuttle you over to the launch point before you can paddle your way back to downtown at a leisurely pace. This way, you can see more of the area compared to what you would if you were treading water with a same-location pickup and return point.\n\nkayaking in Nashville\n\n23 – Join the excitement of the Great Big Game Show\n\nLive the adrenaline-pumping experience of being on a televised game show without the nerve-wracking prospect of millions of viewers.

Some tours even include stops at popular eateries or breweries — the Nashville Farmers Market is a common spot — so that you can refuel with some quintessential local fare.\n\nbike tours in Nashville\n\n25 – Make a splash on the drop slides or lazy river at the upscale SoundWaves waterpark at Gaylord Opryland\n\nFound right next to the Grand Ole Opry in Music Valley (about a 15-minute drive northeast of downtown Nashville), the Gaylord Opryland resort and hotel has long been regarded as one of the most happening places in the city.\n\nThis reputation was only solidified in 2018 when SoundWaves – the brand new, near-hundred-million dollar indoor and outdoor upscale water park – opened to the public.\n\nFeaturing a whole host of adrenaline-pumping slides and rides (including everything from thrilling body slides like Beat Drop, Stage Dive and Rock’N Racer to splashtastic rafting adventures like the Rapid Remix and the Record Launch, SoundWaves has quickly become a staple summer attraction for beating the summer heat.\n\nBut it’s not just about high-octane thrills here. The resort also boasts an impressive lazy river, wave pool, rock climbing wall, flowrider surfing experience, and even a couple of dedicated kids playing areas (the indoor Half Note Cove and the Rising Stars Stage).\n\nKeep in mind: while the multiple kid-only areas make this a great place for families, there’s also an adults-only area that covers indoor and outdoor pools, bars and lounging areas, so you won’t be surrounded by kids all day (unless you want to be).\n\n26 – Snap a few selfies at Madame Tussauds\n\nA worldwide institution, Madame Tussauds needs no introduction. The world-famous chain of wax museums has outposts in all corners of the globe – and, as of April 2017, that now includes Nashville.\n\nThe latest addition to the Music City’s already impressive roster of attractions, Madame Tussauds Nashville is located on Broadway in the heart of the city’s bustling downtown district. And, differentiating this location from those across the country: The Music City’s gallery is all about — yep, you guessed it — the local music scene!\n\nVisitors can expect to see (and snap envy-evoking selfies) with incredibly lifelike wax models of some of the biggest names in country music, including Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban. There are also figures of wider pop-culture icons like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nMake sure to swing by the wax museum’s soul lounge and jazz bar exhibits, and join in on the interactive exhibits too: jam with Jimi Hendrix, join Elvis on stage, or belt out a performance of your own.

From country and gospel to rock ‘n’ roll and soul, the museum celebrates all genres of music and the artists who have shaped them.\n\nWith multiple floors of interactive exhibits, there are bucketloads to keep music-lovers occupied here. You can explore the history of country music through hands-on displays, admire iconic instruments used by legends like Elvis, Ringo Starr, and Jimi Hendrix, and more recent beloved musicians like Garth Brooks.\n\nWhat sets this particular institution apart is its ability to unveil the curtain; tourists can learn all about the craftsmen behind the label – the unsung heroes who played on hundreds of hit records but aren’t as well-known to the public.\n\nYou’ve heard the songs, so come see the instruments and the studios used to make them! Plus, with a slew of interactive exhibits for songwriting, recording, and DJing, it’s something the whole family is guaranteed to enjoy.\n\nMusicians Hall of Fame tickets\n\n28 – Sample local wine at the Belle Meade Mansion\n\nDating all the way back to 1853 and once set across roughly 5,400 acres (closer to 30 these days), this strikingly posh Greek Revival mansion remains hands-down one of the largest and wealthiest in town.\n\nWith its elegant architecture and stunning gardens (which contain a game court, horse farm, and on-site winery offering samples to visitors), any tour of the mansion and its grounds is a delightful experience.\n\nAesthetics aside, this mansion – being a former plantation – is also steeped in history.

Or, for that extra luxe experience, consider booking the Chef-Inspired Food & Wine Pairing.\n\nBelle Meade tours\n\n29 – Play detective at the Dinner Detective Murder Mystery Dinner Show\n\nA classic whodunnit with a dash of humor and multiple platefuls of tantalizing Southern fare, the Dinner Detective Murder Mystery Dinner Show deserves to sit high on your list of things to do in Nashville if you’re the type of person who loves a good puzzle – or just a good meal.\n\nThis is not your average dinner theater experience; there are no zany costumes or over-the-top acting here.
