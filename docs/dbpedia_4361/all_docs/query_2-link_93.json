        "text": "LIFE IN THE PAST LANE: Poems\n\nby Peter Carlaftes\n\n“These poems take the reader running at a fast clip. Much better than same old descriptions of the down & out.” —Charles Plymell, author, Benzedrine Highway\n\nIn his impressive third volume of poetry, Peter Carlaftes digs into the beauty—and lunacy—of contemporary pop culture and its tendency to masque and disrupt the sustainability not just of the planet, but human nature itself, from love and ecstasy to anger and grief. The poems in Life in the Past Lane are both daring and discreet, ranging from full frontal assaults on political and religious cults to tender, discerning, intimate studies of the challenges of self-faith, relationships and maintaining quiet equilibrium in the noisy space of modern life. Risk-taking and endlessly innovative, Life in the Past Lane offers poems that dare to ask questions to which there is no answer, and to answer the unasked. READ MORE\n\nPreorder LIFE IN THE PAST LANE directly from Three Rooms Press or wherever fine books are sold, including:\n\nAWE AND OTHER WORDS LIKE WOW: Poems\n\nby Kat Georges\n\n“A multitude of joys.” —Maw Shein Win, author, Storage Unite for the Spirit House\n\n“Georges is a keen observer of urban life. It’s not that she doesn’t see the grit, but she hears a siren as a soprano.” —Karen Hildebrand, author, Crossing Pleasure Avenue\n\n“This is poetry that pops and flows—rhapsodic, philippic, giddy and wise.” —George Wallace, author, Poppin’ Johnny\n\nIn her second poetry collection, Kat Georges consciously searches for joy in a world of growing darkness. She finds it in unexpected places: at the doctor’s office, after being diagnosed with a serious ailment; on the streets of New York, after hearing a young child’s laugh; facing off with noisy neighbors; in a supermarket vegetable section encounter with a philosopher. Her adamant insistence on seeking light in the darkest of places sets her work apart in a media-driven world seeking out the grief and devastation, and provides both solace and inspiration for the reader. These new poems combine humor and deep insight into human nature to capture moments of much-needed wonder and enchantment.

Eighteen-year-old Kyla Bell dreams of becoming a professional touring musician, but she gets no support from her parents, who want her to go to college. One night, her dreams are answered. But there’s a big catch … READ MORE\n\nOrder SECRET RULES TO BEING A ROCKSTAR directly from Three Rooms Press or anywhere fine books are sold, inlcuding:\n\nShare This!"
