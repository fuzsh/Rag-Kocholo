        "text": "After selling out venues throughout the country, the smash-hit, all-Native comedy show, Good Medicine, returns to Cal Shakes for a one-night-stand of stand-up! Hosted and produced by comedian Jackie Keliiaa (Netflix) the showcase features the best and brightest Native comedians across North America. Actor-comedian Tatanka Means, noted for his appearances in Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” (2023) and Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga” (Part 1 in theaters this June), will headline the show, performing alongside comedians Brian Bahe (Comedy Central) and Dakota Ray Hebert (Just for Laughs).\n\nSince the show’s humble beginnings, Good Medicine has sold-out shows across the country and featured comedians hailing from over 30 tribal Nations who have been seen on Comedy Central, Netflix, ABC, NBC, FX and more! Good Medicine is more than a comedy show—it cultivates joy, community, and creates narrative change. “We believe that humor has the power to heal and build bridges of understanding across communities. And did I mention our shows are also really funny?,” said Keliiaa, “You won’t find any stoic Hollywood tropes in these sets; these comedians are using humor to define Native identity in our own words and on our own terms.” Don’t miss this nationally acclaimed showcase featuring fresh and diverse Native voices.\n\nTATANKA MEANS\n\nTatanka Means is an award-winning actor and stand-up comedian from Chinle, Arizona.

His other recent work include the critically acclaimed “Reservation Dogs.” He is currently filming the new Netflix series “Ransom Canyon.” Aside from acting, Means performs standup comedy throughout Indian Country spreading laughter and messages of motivation to all ages.
