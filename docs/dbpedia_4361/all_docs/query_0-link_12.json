        "text": "The hero of Leave No Trace, Michael Walker, is a former park ranger and current special agent for the Investigative Services Branch (ISB) of the National Park Service (the park service’s version of the FBI). So to celebrate the upcoming publication of Michael’s inaugural adventure (February 27 from Minotaur Books), I thought I’d provide some context for the role park rangers have played in pop culture, specifically film and television:\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nHey There, It’s Yogi Bear (1964)\n\nOf course, we had to start with the animated film that was based upon the syndicated TV show “The Yogi Bear Show.” Ranger Smith, Yogi’s perpetual, decades-long nemesis in Jellystone National Park, was very likely an entire generation’s introduction to the very existence of park rangers. Yogi and Boo-Boo were every bit as good here as in their shorter form tales, sure to be appreciated by purists while others may prefer the 2010 live action (more or less) version featuring Tom Cavanaugh as Ranger Smith with Dan Aykroyd voicing Yogi and Justin Timberlake voicing Boo-Boo.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nFlipper (1964-1967)\n\nRanger Porter Ricks is responsible for preserving the safety of animal and human alike in Coral Key Park, Florida while raising two sons. In addition to foiling poachers and protecting marine and mammal life, Ricks portrayed one of the first single fathers ever on television. One of his sons, Sandy, was played by blond-haired, blue-eyed Luke Halpin who became one of the original teen TV pinups. But the real star of the show, of course, was the domesticated dolphin who played the role of a water-dwelling Lassie in adventures amid a beautiful setting.\n\nGentle Ben (1967-1969)\n\nAfter “Gunsmoke” and before “McCloud,” Dennis Weaver played a park ranger assigned to Everglades National Park, while also raising a family that includes the tame bear of the title. Clint Howard famously played the boy, alternately rescuing and being rescued from trouble by his pet bear. “Gentle Ben” was pretty much the same show as “Flipper,” minus Luke Halpin’s blond locks—no coincidence since both shows were made by Ivan Tors and were filmed on location in Florida.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nGrizzly (1976)\n\nSpeaking of bears, the not-so-tame, eighteen-foot monster who is kind of “Jaws,” only with paws, quickly dissolves into an inadvertent spin into camp. Tom Wedloe steps into the Roy Scheider role of the Spielberg classic, playing another park ranger in Everglades National Park, where the giant bear has staked its claim. As a homage to its forebear, the hero’s wife is similarly named “Ellen.” Don’t look for a Quint-like bear hunter, unless you count a helicopter pilot who assists the ranger’s efforts to restore the natural order.\n\nThe River Wild (1994)\n\nPlayed with rugged machismo, Benjamin Bratt’s stalwart Montana park ranger is nonetheless unable to save a white-water rafting guide played by Meryl Street from killers who’ve taken her family hostage amid the rapids. Streep did a number of her own stunts, but there was a scare at the end of one day of filming when Hanson asked Streep to shoot one more scene, even though she was exhausted. Street eventually gave in and ended up getting swept off the raft into the river and had to be saved by a river rescue team.\n\nBroken Arrow (1996)\n\nPilot Christian Slater joins forces with Park Ranger Samantha Mathis to take on nuclear terrorists who’ve managed to steal two atomic bombs off a disabled stealth bomber. This thriller helped define an era that also spawned other action-dominated films like “The Rock” and “Con Air,” but failed to turn Slater into an action star on the level of Nicolas Cage. Slater might know his nukes in the movie, but it’s Mathis’ knowledge of the rough terrain of Utah’s Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that ultimately saves the day.\n\nCocaine Bear (2023)\n\nWe saved the best, and most recent, for last. The always great Margo Martindale plays a park ranger named Liz whose worst day ever confronts her with yet another bear who is not a monster, but a cocaine addict—well, at least user in that he’s consumed enough of the drug to get a small country high. Appearing terrified even though she never actually worked with a live bear during the shoot posed little problem. “It was easy,” the Emmy Award-winning actress told “Entertainment Weekly. “I’m easily frightened. And I’ve had a big bear right on our property, right out in front of our house, several times.”\n\n***"
