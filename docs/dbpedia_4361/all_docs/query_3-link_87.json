        "text": "From the psychedelic '60s through to the polished delivery of their later work, Floyd in the Flesh are deeply passionate about the music of Pink Floyd and pride themselves on delivering an authentic sound and show every time. For 2024, the band aim to perform their most ambitious setlist to date featuring a wealth of greatest hits, rarities and fan favourites, in a show which is a complete experience for all the senses. Featuring some of the country’s most talented musicians, a spellbinding lighting show and authentic projections on that iconic circular screen, this is the show Pink Floyd fans won't want to miss.\n\nColdplace - The World's Leading Tribute to Coldplay is a stunning live concert performance, celebrating the music of one of the most successful bands of all time. The only tribute to have worked for Coldplay, this outstanding band leads you through all your favourite Coldplay hits from the last 20+ years including Yellow, Paradise and A Sky full of Stars, right through to Higher Power and My Universe from their latest album, Music of the Spheres. This world class show faithfully recreates the magic of Coldplay's record breaking live tours - featuring lasers, confetti, video screen and the Xyloband LED wristbands that have become synonymous with Coldplay concerts, and truly make the audience part of the show.\n\nJoin us for a panto themed day of family fun! There will be Market Stalls, Competitions, Inflatables, Crafts, Games and Wesley Wolf's Treasure Hunt! Also our fabulous panto cast will be here so come and meet them and get some photos.\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you all there!\n\nMark Watson's 12-year-old son has just got a phone. His 70-year-old dad has been through the most frightening experience of his life. Both a dad and a kid himself, around the midpoint of his life, the Taskmaster star and multiple award-winner - now also famous as one-third of YouTube cult sensation No More Jockeys - returns. He'll consider the search for meaning that we're all on, with or without Google. There'll be a lot of jokes, and a show that's different every night.\n\nWe are delighted to be welcoming ABBA Sensation back to the MMC! Widely considered to be one of the best ever Abba Tribute Acts, they play to packed theatres and festivals throughout Europe. A stunning stage show, which combines costume changes, lighting effects and a faithful reproduction of the Abba sound. A great evening's entertainment is guaranteed for all age ranges. The band love audience participation, so you can sing along, clap or even get up and dance.\n\nFrom the group that brought you the sell out success \"The Sound of Music\" comes \"The Wedding Singer\", an immersive experience musical based on the hit Adam Sandler film. Robbie Hart is the lead singer of Simply Wed, until he is dumped at the alter of his own wedding.
