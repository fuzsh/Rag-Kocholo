        "text": "Profession frequency\n\nWe calculate the media frequency of a profession as the total number of professional mentions (both singular and plural form, for example, advocate and advocates) divided by the total number of n-grams in the subtitles. Here, n equals the number of words in the profession phrase, for example, doctor is a 1-gram, chief executive officer is a 3-gram, etc. We calculate the frequency of SOC major groups by adding the frequencies of professions mapped to it (see section Taxonomy Creation). This frequency measure is motivated by the Google-ngrams study [23]. We calculate the trend of a profession or SOC major group as the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient [74] of its media frequency against time. A significant positive correlation denotes an increasing trend, and a significant negative correlation implies a decreasing trend over time (α = 0.05).\n\nshows the trend of the 23 major SOC groups, from most positive to most negative. lists these groups and their frequency trends. Only 3 SOC groups showed an increasing frequency trend in mentions over time, while 16 SOC groups decreased in frequency over time. The rank correlation was not significant for the remaining 4 SOC groups. These SOC groups contain 500 professions (see section Taxonomy Creation). We analyze the trend of some professions belonging to these SOC groups.\n\nTable 3\n\nIncreasing FrequencyNo TrendComputer and Mathematical OccupationsLegal OccupationsLife, Physical, and Social Science OccupationsFood Preparation and Serving Related OccupationsArt, Design, Entertainment, Sports, Media OccupationsHealthcare Support OccupationsBusiness and Financial Operations Occupations Decreasing Frequency Personal Care and Service OccupationsCommunity and Social Service OccupationsInstallation, Maintenance, and Repair OccupationsHealthcare Practitioners and Technical OccupationsFarming, Fishing, and Forestry OccupationsProtective Service OccupationsArchitecture and Engineering OccupationsProduction OccupationsSales and Related OccupationsTransportation and Material Moving OccupationsManagement OccupationsOffice and Administrative Support OccupationsEducational Instruction and Library OccupationsBuilding, Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance OccupationsConstruction and Extraction OccupationsMilitary Specific Occupations\n\nComputer and Mathematical Occupations: This SOC group includes mathematicians and computer-related professions. shows the frequency trend of two of its professions: hacker and programmer. Both occupations showed a positive frequency trend, but mentions of hackers increased more than programmers.\n\nLife, Physical, and Social Science Occupations: This SOC group includes archaeologists, astronauts, biologists, chemists, geologists, etc. Almost all its professions showed an increasing frequency trend over time. shows the trend of four occupations: geologist, biologist, anthropologist, and economist. Mentions of geologists and biologists are consistently more frequent than economists and anthropologists.\n\nArts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations: This SOC group includes entertainment, sports, music, and media-related professions. show the frequency trends of some of its professions. Mentions of actor dominate actress mentions in media content. The word actor can be used as a gender-neutral term, explaining part of this trend. The frequency of sports-related professions dipped in the 1960s but has increased since then. Pianist mentions decreased, whereas mentions of bass players, guitarists, and drummers increased over time. Mentions of journalists and reporters are more frequent than correspondents and columnists.\n\nLegal Occupations: Legal occupations include lawyers, judges, attorneys, prosecutors, etc. shows the frequency trend of defense attorneys and prosecutors. Mentions of prosecutors (a lawyer who conducts a case against a defendant) are more frequent than defense attorneys (a lawyer who defends the client against criminal charges).\n\nFood Preparation and Serving Related Occupations: This SOC group includes professions related to food serving and food preparation. show the frequency trends of some of its occupations. Mentions of waiters are more frequent than waitresses overall. Similar to actors, waiters can refer to either gender, so this trend is not surprising. However, mentions of waiters have decreased over time, whereas mentions of waitresses have increased. Gendered professional mentions like barman and barmaid are less frequent than the gender-neutral term: bartender. Mentions of cooks were more common than chefs, but the latter became more frequent in media content in the 2010s.\n\nHealthcare Support Occupations: This SOC group includes healthcare assistants, nursing aides, massage therapists, etc. shows the frequency trend of two gendered professions: masseur (male) and masseuse (female). The frequency of masseurs has significantly decreased over time after it peaked around 1970. Mentions of masseuses have become more common than masseurs. The frequency of the gender-neutral term, massage therapist, has increased over time.\n\nBusiness and Financial Operations Occupations: This SOC group includes accountants, contractors, auditors, etc. shows the frequency trend of accountants and auditors. Their frequencies have mostly remained steady over time. Accountants are more frequent than auditors.\n\nPersonal Care and Service Occupations: This SOC group includes barbers, valets, nannies, ushers, etc. shows the frequency trend of three child-care-related professions: nanny, babysitter, and governess. The mention frequency of nannies and babysitters has increased over time. The word governess is an archaic term, and its usage has declined.\n\nInstallation, Maintenance, and Repair Occupations: This SOC group includes mechanics, electricians, locksmiths, etc. shows the frequency trend of electricians and mechanics. The mentions of both these professions have decreased in media subtitles.\n\nFarming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupations: This SOC group includes farmers, shepherds, herders, fishermen, etc. shows the frequency trend of farmers, fishermen, and hunters. Mentions of farmers and fishermen have decreased, whereas mentions of hunters have increased over time.\n\nArchitecture and Engineering Occupations: This SOC group includes architects, designers, engineers, surveyors, etc. shows the frequency trend of engineers and architects. The frequency of architect mentions has remained steady over time, whereas mentions of engineers have diminished.\n\nSales and Related Occupations: This SOC group includes sales and real-estate-related professions. show the frequency trends of some of its occupations. Mentions of retailers, distributors, vendors, and brokers have increased over time. The increase in frequency is even more prevalent in real-estate jobs: estate agent, realtor, and real estate agent.\n\nManagement Occupations: This SOC group includes administrative professions and occupations related to the management of educational institutions. show the frequency trend of some management occupations. Mentions of both congressman and congresswoman have increased over time. Although congressmen are mentioned more than congresswomen, the frequency of congresswomen has increased at a higher rate (not discernible from the graph). Mentions of senators, governors, and mayors have decreased over time. The frequency of headmistress mentions has increased, whereas headmaster mentions have decreased in media content. The frequency of the gender-neutral term, principal, has increased.\n\nEducational Instruction and Library Occupations: This SOC group includes teachers, professors, librarians, etc. shows their frequency trends. Professor mentions have decreased greatly over time, whereas the frequency of teacher and librarian mentions have increased slightly.\n\nConstruction and Extraction Occupations: This SOC group includes builders, carpenters, masons, miners, etc. shows their frequency trends. The frequency of masons has remained steady, but miner and carpenter mentions have reduced over time.\n\nCommunity and Social Service Occupations: This SOC group includes religious and social workers. shows the frequency trend of some religious occupations. The mention frequency of bishops and reverends has decreased over time, whereas the frequency of pastors and deacons has increased. Mentions of imams, lamas, and rabbis have also increased over time, but the frequency of priests has decreased.\n\nHealthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations: This SOC group includes healthcare-related professions. show the frequency trend of some of its professions. Mentions of healthcare specialists like cardiologists, chiropractors, gynecologists, and neurologists have increased over time, but the frequency of the generic term, doctor, has decreased.\n\nProtective Service Occupations: This SOC group includes law enforcement and protective service workers. show the frequency trend of some of its professions. Mentions of policemen have decreased over time but are still much higher than mentions of policewomen, which have remained steady. Guard occupations like bodyguards, prison guards, and security guards have become more frequent in media content.\n\nProduction Occupations: Production occupations include artisans, cobblers, jewelers, millers, etc. shows the frequency trend of some of its professions: jeweler, shoemaker, and tailor. The mention frequency of all three professions has decreased over time.\n\nTransportation and Material Moving Occupations: This SOC group includes professions related to the transportation of goods and people. show frequency trends of different transportation-related professions. Mentions of bus drivers increased, cab drivers remained steady, and truck drivers decreased over time. Mentions of sailors decreased more rapidly than pilots. The frequency of gendered professional terms like steward and stewardess decreased over time. The frequency of the gender-neutral term, flight attendant, increased.\n\nOffice and Administrative Support Occupations: This SOC group includes clerks, receptionists, tellers, notaries, etc. shows the frequency trend of some of its professions: clerk, secretary, and bookkeeper. The frequency of all three professions decreased over time.\n\nBuilding, Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations: This SOC group includes construction workers, maids, chamberlains, janitors, etc. shows the frequency trend of some of its professions: gardener, sweeper, and caretaker. Mentions of all three professions decreased over time in media content.\n\nMilitary Specific occupations: Military occupations include army, naval and air-force-related professions. shows the frequency trend of some of its professions. Mentions of field marshal (army) and admiral (navy) decreased over time. The frequency of air marshal mentions increased (not discernible from the graph).\n\nThe frequency trend of the SOC group does not reflect the frequency trend of all its professions. For example, show increasing trends for many sales-related professions, but the overall frequency of the Sales Occupations SOC group decreased. A large proportion of Sales Occupations mentions are comprised of bankers and cashiers, whose frequencies have decreased.\n\n6 Jan 2022\n\nPONE-D-21-27904Representation of professions in entertainment media: Insights into frequency and sentiment trends through computational text analysisPLOS ONE\n\nDear Dr. Baruah\n\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE, and apologies once again for the length of time it took to send this work out for review. I am pleased to report that I have now managed to secure two expert reviews of your work. Both reviewers feel that it the work has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process. Both reviewers agree that this is a worthwhile and carefully conducted study, something that I also sensed when reading the manuscript. All of us appreciate the clear writing style. Reviewer 1 raises some \"high-level\" issues, mostly around the interpretation of your findings. They are particularly concerned about possible causal relationships between the correlates that you identify in your work, and I agree that this needs some finessing in a revision. As Reviewer 1 states, if one wishes to offer a particular causal interpretation, evidence needs to be provided to support this; otherwise, one should instead emphasise the nature of the correlations and at most tentatively suggest causal hypotheses that could be further explored in future work. At the same time, Reviewer 1 notes that the manuscript presents a body of facts, but does not offer possible explanations for them - so clearly some speculation is to be appreciated, as long as it is presented as such. Reviewer 2 makes a similar observation and would appreciate a more extensive discussion of where your results fit within current theoretical frameworks and implications for future work. I also felt this would be necessary to include in a revision, and despite the brevity of Reviewer 2's report, it gets to the heart of the main issue standing in the way of an acceptance decision. My impression is that all comments of the reviewers are reasonable, not in conflict, and can be accommodated with relatively minor additions to the manuscript. Certainly it does not look as though more technical work is required, just a little more effort in discussing and interpreting the results so that the reader can better appreciate the implications of your findings (rather than the nature of the findings themselves, which is well explained). My preference wherever possible is to avoid a second round of review, which I think is feasible if you are able to address all the points raised by the reviewers primarily through changes to the manuscript and only occasionally with a rebuttal that makes a compelling case without recourse to lengthy technical detail. Please submit your revised manuscript by Feb 20 2022 11:59PM.

The frequency and sentiment information is extracted from the subtitles of 136,000 movies and TV shows, using Named Entity Recognition, WordNet, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Sentiment Analysis.\n\nIn general, the paper is clearly written and the methods used for analysis of the data are appropriate. The following review first discusses some high-level issues and then discusses some low-level details.\n\nHigh-level Concepts\n\nAbstract: \"Professions that employ more people have increased media frequency, supporting our hypothesis that media acts as a mirror to society.\"\n\n-- Let E be the levels of employment in various professions. Let F be the frequency of various words for professions. Let S be the sentiment of various words applied to professions. The sentence quoted here suggests that variation in E causes variation in F and S: that is, E is the real thing, whereas F and S are merely reflections (mirrors) of E. The paper makes it clear that E is correlated with F and S, but the paper does not demonstrate how the causal connection goes. There are (at least) three possibilities: (1) Variation in E causes variations in F and S. (2) Variations in F and S cause variations in E. (3) Variation in some other thing, X, causes variation in E, F, and S. All three of these causal connections seem possible to me, and it is not at all clear which is the actual connection. The authors need to either (A) be clear that they have only demonstrated correlation and not causation or (B) provide solid evidence that there is indeed a specific causal relation connecting E, F, and S. If the authors choose (A) (causation unknown), then they should remove all expressions, such as \"acts as a mirror\", that imply a specific causal relation. My guess is option (3): changes in technology (X) drive changes in the level of employment in various professions (E), they drive changes in sentiment towards various professions (S), and they drive changes in the frequency of various words for professions. But I have no rigorous evidence for this hypothesis.\n\nLines 8-10: \"Cultivation theory suggests that prolonged exposure to the content we see on TV shapes our outlook and makes us believe that to be our reality [1].\"\n\n-- There should be some discussion of alternatives to Cultivation theory. For example: The Fruits of Cultivation Analysis: A Reexamination of Some Effects of Television Watching (pp. 287-302), Michael Hughes.\n\n-- https://www.jstor.org/stable/2748103\n\n-- Wikipedia says that there are two alternatives to Cultivation theory that are more widely used: \"In a 2004 study, surveying almost 2,000 articles published in the top three mass communication journals since 1956, Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron found that cultivation theory was the third most frequently utilized cultural theory.\"\n\n-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_theory\n\nLines 553-557: \"The frequency trend of the SOC group does not reflect the frequency trend of all its professions. For example, Figs 8 e) and f) show increasing trends for many sales-related professions, but the overall frequency of the Sales Occupations SOC group decreased. A large proportion of Sales Occupations mentions are comprised of bankers and cashiers, whose frequencies have decreased.\"\n\n-- Do the authors have an explanation for this? The paper should not be merely a collection of facts. Perhaps it is difficult to prove an explanation is correct, however it would be useful to suggest some hypotheses.\n\nLines 569-570: \"Therefore, the number of positive sentiment mentions is greater than the number of negative sentiment mentions for all the SOC groups.\"\n\n-- Again, some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nLines 589-598: \"Fig 12 shows the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [...] also one of the most positive sentiment trends.\"\n\n-- Some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nLines 676-677: \"In this section, we test the hypothesis that media stories reflect real-world events.\"\n\n-- The word \"reflect\" here is somewhat metaphorical. There is an implication that real-world events cause media stories. But perhaps media stories cause real-world events. Or perhaps both are caused by some third factor. All that the authors can say with certainty is that there is correlation. I would very much welcome some explicit discussion of causality in this paper, but I don't think it's right to smuggle causality into the paper using terms such as \"reflect\". If the authors are unable to firmly state that there is a certain causal connection, they could still offer some tentative hypotheses about causation.\n\nLines 726-720: \"Lastly, we observed that media frequency correlates with the employment trend of most SOC groups. Professions that employed more people were also more frequently mentioned in media content. This supports our hypothesis that media mirrors society and plays a role in our professional choices.\"\n\n-- Again, the word \"mirror\" suggests that society is the cause and media is the effect. This paragraph starts with \"correlates\" (quite rightly) and ends with \"mirrors\" (somewhat unscientific). I encourage some discussion of causality, but it should be explicit and straightforward, acknowledging the difficulty of causal analysis.\n\nLow-level Details\n\nAbstract: \"Societal ideas and trends dictate media narratives and cinematic depictions which in turn influences people's beliefs and perceptions of the real world.\"\n\n-- \"ideas\", \"trends\", and \"depictions\" are plurals; therefore the verb should be \"influence\", not \"influences\".\n\nAbstract: \"study the effect of media attributes like genre, country of production, and title type\"\n\n-- replace \"like\" with \"such as\"\n\n-- http://www.differencebetween.net/language/grammar-language/difference-between-such-as-and-like\n\nAbstract: \"and investigate if the incidence of professions in media subtitles correlate with their real-world employment statistics\"\n\n-- replace \"if\" with \"whether\"\n\n-- https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/if-vs-whether-difference-usage\n\nLines 16-18: \"Professions are paid, skilled work we perform to provide services to people and earn a livelihood. It defines our role in society and allows us to contribute to a nation's economy.\"\n\n-- replace \"It defines\" with \"They define\"\n\nLines 21-22: \"Therefore, it is essential to study and assess the changes in the occupational structure of the nation.\"\n\n-- Why \"of the nation\"? Which nation are you talking about? Should it be \"of a nation\" or \"of nations\"?\n\nLines 40-41: \"Several studies have examined the nature of the portrayal of different professions in popular media, like lawyers [13], accountants [14], physicians [15], and cops [16].\"\n\n-- replace \"like\" with \"such as\"\n\nLines 67-69: \"2. We describe and share a new corpus of professional mentions, spanning 4,000 professions, 136,000 movies and TV shows, ranging over the years 1950 to 2017 68 (almost 7 decades) created by analyzing job title occurrences in media subtitles.\"\n\n-- This would be a good place to add a reference to the list of references at the end of the paper. The reference would give a URL for downloading the new corpus. I think it is best to insert a reference here, rather than inserting a URL here.\n\nLines 72-75: \"4. We analyze the frequency and contextual sentiment trend of professional mentions in media over time.

All of us appreciate the clear writing style.\n\nResponse =============\n\nThank you.\n\nComment 2 =============\n\nReviewer 1 raises some \"high-level\" issues, mostly around the interpretation of your findings. They are particularly concerned about possible causal relationships between the correlates that you identify in your work, and I agree that this needs some finessing in a revision. As Reviewer 1 states, if one wishes to offer a particular causal interpretation, evidence needs to be provided to support this; otherwise, one should instead emphasize the nature of the correlations and at most tentatively suggest causal hypotheses that could be further explored in future work.\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe agree with the editor and reviewer 1, and acknowledge that we should refrain from causal assertions in our correlational study. We replace all potential ambiguous/ misleading statements like \"media is a mirror to society\" with \"media and societal trends correlate with each other\". While establishing causality would have been a much stronger result, showing that with our present experimental setting is difficult without accounting for additional demographic, political, technological, and cultural factors along with establishing the ecological validity of such findings given the constraints of the confounding variables. Our effort is a step towards this direction, and future work should include more controlled studies. We highlight this in our updated conclusion.\n\nRevision =============\n\nAbstract\n\nProfessions that employ more people showed increased media frequency.\n\nLines 684-686\n\nIn this section, we study the correlation between media frequency and real-world events, namely employment figures.\n\nLines 695-696\n\nTherefore, the trend of media frequency correlates with the employment trend for most SOC groups.\n\nLines 760-763\n\nProfessions that employed more people were also more frequently mentioned in media content.\n\nTherefore, media frequency correlates with employment. This finding however does not imply causality, a question which requires further systematic study.\n\nLines 790-791\n\nImportantly, future work should also consider investigating causal relations, beyond correlations, between media representations and employment trends.\n\nComment 3 =============\n\nAt the same time, Reviewer 1 notes that the manuscript presents a body of facts, but does not offer possible explanations for them - so clearly some speculation is to be appreciated, as long as it is presented as such.\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe have reworked the discussion section to suggest possible reasons behind the observed media frequency and sentiment trends. We could not always find proper references to support our hypotheses, and sometimes even found published studies contradicting our media trends. We have included the relevant published work and have tried our best to explain the media trends.\n\nRevision =============\n\nLines 703-706\n\nWe observed that gender-neutral terms like massage therapists and flight-attendants are becoming more frequent than their gendered counterparts. This might be due to the increased conversations around using gender-neutral terms among the youth and the LGBTQ+ community [75, 76].\n\nLines 707-712\n\nThe frequency of some female job titles like waitresses, congresswomen, and policewomen has either increased or remained steady relative to the corresponding male job titles -- waiters, congressmen, and policemen -- which have decreased in frequency.\n\nThe increasing representation of women in police and government might be because of improvement in equal opportunity legislation, women's rights movements [77], and constitutional amendments for women's suffrage [78].\n\nLines 714-718\n\nThe frequency of STEM, sports, arts, and design occupations has increased, whereas the frequency of construction, farming, and manual labor jobs has decreased.\n\nImprovement in cinematography and visual effects technology, space travel, the emergence of the world wide web, and sports documentaries might have contributed to the increased fascination of science and sports in media [79, 80].\n\nWe have similarly revised Lines 719-748 and offered possible hypotheses to explain the observed media trends.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREVIEWER 1\n\nComment 1 =============\n\nAbstract: \"Professions that employ more people have increased media frequency, supporting our hypothesis that media acts as a mirror to society.\" -- Let E be the levels of employment in various professions. Let F be the frequency of various words for professions. Let S be the sentiment of various words applied to professions. The sentence quoted here suggests that variation in E causes variation in F and S: that is, E is the real thing, whereas F and S are merely reflections (mirrors) of E. The paper makes it clear that E is correlated with F and S, but the paper does not demonstrate how the causal connection goes. There are (at least) three possibilities: (1) Variation in E causes variations in F and S. (2) Variations in F and S cause variations in E. (3) Variation in some other thing, X, causes variation in E, F, and S. All three of these causal connections seem possible to me, and it is not at all clear which is the actual connection. The authors need to either (A) be clear that they have only demonstrated correlation and not causation or (B) provide solid evidence that there is indeed a specific causal relation connecting E, F, and S. If the authors choose (A) (causation unknown), then they should remove all expressions, such as \"acts as a mirror\", that imply a specific causal relation. My guess is option (3): changes in technology (X) drive changes in the level of employment in various professions (E), they drive changes in sentiment towards various professions (S), and they drive changes in the frequency of various words for professions. But I have no rigorous evidence for this hypothesis.\n\nLines 676-677: \"In this section, we test the hypothesis that media stories reflect real-world events.\"\n\n-- The word \"reflect\" here is somewhat metaphorical. There is an implication that real-world events cause media stories. But perhaps media stories cause real-world events. Or perhaps both are caused by some third factor. All that the authors can say with certainty is that there is correlation. I would very much welcome some explicit discussion of causality in this paper, but I don't think it's right to smuggle causality into the paper using terms such as \"reflect\". If the authors are unable to firmly state that there is a certain causal connection, they could still offer some tentative hypotheses about causation.\n\nLines 726-720: \"Lastly, we observed that media frequency correlates with the employment trend of most SOC groups. Professions that employed more people were also more frequently mentioned in media content. This supports our hypothesis that media mirrors society and plays a role in our professional choices.\"\n\n-- Again, the word \"mirror\" suggests that society is the cause and media is the effect. This paragraph starts with \"correlates\" (quite rightly) and ends with \"mirrors\" (somewhat unscientific). I encourage some discussion of causality, but it should be explicit and straightforward, acknowledging the difficulty of causal analysis.\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe agree that correlation between E and F (or S) does not imply causation. It was not our intention to suggest so either. Therefore, we have rephrased all statements relating media trends and employment to explicitly contain the word “correlation”, and removed misleading statements like “media is a mirror to society”.\n\nRevision =============\n\nSame as the revision to the Editor's second comment (see above).\n\nComment 2 =============\n\nLines 8-10: \"Cultivation theory suggests that prolonged exposure to the content we see on TV shapes our outlook and makes us believe that to be our reality [1].\"\n\n-- There should be some discussion of alternatives to Cultivation theory. For example: The Fruits of Cultivation Analysis: A Reexamination of Some Effects of Television Watching (pp. 287-302), Michael Hughes.\n\n-- https://www.jstor.org/stable/2748103\n\n-- Wikipedia says that there are two alternatives to Cultivation theory that are more widely used: \"In a 2004 study, surveying almost 2,000 articles published in the top three mass communication journals since 1956, Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron found that cultivation theory was the third most frequently utilized cultural theory.\"\n\n-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_theory\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe have provided some discussion on alternatives to Cultivation theory. This debate surrounding the relationship between television viewing and human behavior and beliefs suggests that we require better designed and more demographically inclusive surveys. We have added the suggested citations for completeness.\n\nRevision =============\n\nLines 8 - 15\n\nCultivation theory suggests that prolonged exposure to the content we see on TV shapes our outlook and makes us believe that to be our reality [1]. Several social studies have explored the application of cultivation theory and confirmed its validity [2–4]. However, there are social scientists that have also questioned the validity of the cultivation theory because it ignores socioeconomic factors [5], living conditions [6], and differences in the portrayal of violence on television [7]. Still, this discussion about television and the cultivation of beliefs inspires us to examine their relationship.\n\nComment 3 =============\n\nLines 553-557: \"The frequency trend of the SOC group does not reflect the frequency trend of all its professions. For example, Figs 8 e) and f) show increasing trends for many sales-related professions, but the overall frequency of the Sales Occupations SOC group decreased. A large proportion of Sales Occupations mentions are comprised of bankers and\n\ncashiers, whose frequencies have decreased.\"\n\n-- Do the authors have an explanation for this? The paper should not be merely a collection of facts. Perhaps it is difficult to prove an explanation is correct, however it would be useful to suggest some hypotheses.\n\nLines 569-570: \"Therefore, the number of positive sentiment mentions is greater than the number of negative sentiment mentions for all the SOC groups.\"\n\n-- Again, some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nLines 589-598: \"Fig 12 shows the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [...] also one of the most positive sentiment trends.\"\n\n-- Some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nResponse =============\n\nSimilar to the response to the Editor’s third comment, we have included possible hypotheses with relevant citations to explain the observed frequency and sentiment media trends. The analysis section contains the facts and the discussion section provides possible reasons for these facts.\n\nRevision =============\n\nSame as the revision to the Editor’s third comment.\n\nWe summarize our edits for the low level comments raised by reviewer 1 here:\n\n1. We replace “like” with “such as” at the suggested places.\n\n2. We replace “if” with “whether” at the suggested places.\n\n3. We replace URLs with proper citations for the profession corpus, sentiment dataset, and sentiment algorithm.\n\n4. We replace “males” and “females” with “men” and “women” respectively.\n\n5. We expand the abbreviated forms of CRF and TAC KBP.\n\n6. We describe the LCF BERT model in simpler terms.\n\nLines 386-391\n\nThe LCF model defines a value called semantic relative distance (SRD) for each word in the sentence. SRD is the absolute difference between the word position and the target (professional mention) position in the sentence. The model masks or weighs down the output features of words whose SRD is larger than some threshold, that is, the model reduces the effect of words that are farther away from the profession word in determining the sentiment.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREVIEWER 2\n\nComment 1 =============\n\nAlthough the data and methodology are clearly presented, I would have appreciated the authors pointing out more explicitly their limitations….Also, it would be relevant to underline the main limitations of the study and to provide recommendations for future research in computational social sciences especially in other national and linguistic contexts.\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe acknowledge that the earlier version of the manuscript lacked a discussion of the limitations of our work. While ours is the first large-scale computational analysis on the representation of professions in media subtitles, we can further improve our methods through more sophisticated modeling. Moreover, our domain choice limits the information we can glean about the media portrayal of professions. We have described these limitations and more at the end of the discussion section.\n\nRevision =============\n\nLines 764-779\n\nThere are several limitations of the present work. First, subtitles provide only a limited view of the complete movie or TV show. Features, such as the character's behavior on screen, their interactions with other people, and their character arc can only be studied by carefully viewing the entire movie or TV episode. Therefore, our representation measures of frequency and sentiment of job titles in subtitles do not capture all aspects of their media portrayal.\n\nSecond, our frequency and sentiment analysis does not control for the frequency or sentiment of the professional words in everyday language. For example, the frequency of policewomen might have been less than the frequency of policemen in media subtitles because that is how their usage evolved in literature. A solution to this might be to use the corresponding Google ngram frequencies [23] of the professional words as covariates in our analysis. Third, our study has primarily focused on the representation of professions in the US and the UK (see the distribution of production country in section \\\\nameref{subsec:opensubtitles}). We need to adapt our taxonomy and models to work across different cultures and languages. Our profession taxonomy might not contain job titles that are prevalent in other countries, and we will have to add the professions specific to a local region for a comprehensive study.\n\nComment 2 =============\n\nThe discussion section need substantive rework. While it summarizes well the main results of the article, it fails to engage in a reflective discussion with the findings of other studies. The discussion part would benefit from citing more social sciences references supporting the idea that \"media mirrors society and plays a role in our professional choices\".\n\nResponse =============\n\nWe have reworked the discussion section extensively and provided possible reasons behind the observed media frequency and sentiment trends of professions.\n\nRevision =============\n\nPlease see the revision to the Editor’s third comment.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREFERENCES\n\nWe have not removed any previous references from our manuscript.

They have helped us to improve the paper significantly. Please find our response to your comments below.\n\nThe editor noted that grant information in the ‘Funding Information’ and ‘Financial Disclosures’ sections do not match. This is because our work was supported by a gift grant which did not have a grant number. We have added the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation as a funding source without specifying a grant number in the revision. Our financial disclosure statement is: \"The study was done at Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory, University of Southern California, which is supported by a research award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation (https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of work included in this submission.\" As per the editor’s suggestion, we have included the updated financial disclosure statement in the cover letter as well.\n\nWe have also included a section below called “Editor(Email)” below to respond to the paraphrasing suggestions raised by the editor in the email sent on Mar 7th with the subject: PLOS ONE Decision: Revision required [PONE-D-21-27904R1] - [EMID:931db3d1d60343a8].\n\nSabyasachee Baruah\n\nKrishna Somandepalli\n\nShrikanth Narayanan\n\nEditor (Email)\n\nComment\n\nIn response to me and Reviewer 1, you have included some suggestions as to factors that might be responsible for the changes that have been detected in the corpus. Clearly these are speculative, as we suggested they might be, but I think some further text is necessary to draw attention to the speculative nature of the proposed connections, and the need for further work to establish whether or not they actually hold.\n\nMy suggestion would be to insert some text at the start of the Discussion section, noting that you will tentatively suggest some possible causes of the changes. This might allow you to deviate a little from the \"X might be because of Y\" template you followed throughout the discussion, which I found a little repetitive. I think it would be more satisfactory to employ forms of language like \"There is some evidence of Y [reference], which could lead to [X happening]\" and variants that remove repetition. Where possible it could be useful to add comments as to the mechanism by which it might filter through to your dataset and/or what you might need to do in practice to demonstrate the connection.\n\nResponse\n\nWe changed the introductory passage in the discussion section to emphasize that we selected a few interesting trends to discuss and our hypotheses to explain these trends are purely speculative. We also state that verifying our hypotheses would require further research and controlled experiments. As of now we are still unsure what kind of future experiments we would need because it is difficult to design studies that can establish any form of relationship between media narratives and real-world societal factors. Nevertheless, we suggest some ideas in our discussion.\n\nWe have also created a visualization tool that allows users to explore the trends in our subtitle corpus. We cite it in the discussion section. Also, as per the editor’s paraphrasing-related requests, we have varied the language to deviate from the “X might be because of Y” template.\n\nRevision\n\nLines 704-715\n\nThe frequency and sentiment expressed towards professionals vary in media content\n\ndepending on the character archetype, the story being told, year of production, and\n\ngenre, among other variables. We developed a visualization tool [75] to examine the\n\nfrequency, sentiment, media attribute, and employment trends in our subtitle corpus.\n\nWhile examining the wealth of results using this tool, a few general findings and specific\n\ntrends stood out to us. In this section, we highlight these trends, discuss some reasons\n\nthat may be suggestive for explaining the observed results, and try to reconcile these\n\nfindings with those in relevant studies, both from the real world and the media domain.\n\nWe underscore that our interpretation is purely speculative and requires careful,\n\ncontrolled experiments and surveys to further validate the claims. Also, this discussion\n\nis by no means an effort to explain all our findings, and we hope future research in this\n\nspace may further explain some of the results we found in this large-scale analysis.\n\nLines 718-720\n\nWe suggest that this trend is due to the increased awareness stemming from conversations about gender-neutral terms among the youth, parents, and the LGBTQ+ community [76, 77]\n\nLines 734-736\n\nThese advances and interests potentially explain the increase in the frequency of STEM-related and sports portrayals on the big screen.\n\nLines 741-751\n\nWe posit that as new and specialized professions become popular career choices and essential\n\nin catering to the needs of the continuously evolving society, they also attract the interest of media creators.\n\nTechnology improvements in computerized financial transactions (barcode scanning, automatic teller machines, and mobile banking)\n\nand customers’ preference for self-service checkouts probably contributed to the\n\ndecrease in employment of bankers and cashiers [84, 85], or at least their explicit mentions in media narratives.\n\nLines 773-781\n\nWe have made several hypotheses to explain the observed frequency and sentiment\n\ntrends and require controlled experiments to verify these claims. It is challenging to\n\ndesign such studies because we are trying to relate media narratives to real-world events\n\n– two very different domains. As of now, we are unsure regarding what types of\n\nexperiments are required, but we suggest some ideas. We can survey scriptwriters and\n\nmovie directors to find what societal events inspired their stories and creative decisions.\n\nWe can also try to map change points in media trends to real-world events to explain\n\ntheir possible cascading effects on media narratives and genres. We leave this task for\n\nfuture research.\n\nEditor\n\nComment 1\n\nBoth reviewers agree that this is a worthwhile and carefully conducted study, something that I also sensed when reading the manuscript. All of us appreciate the clear writing style.\n\nResponse\n\nThank you.\n\nComment 2\n\nReviewer 1 raises some \"high-level\" issues, mostly around the interpretation of your findings. They are particularly concerned about possible causal relationships between the correlates that you identify in your work, and I agree that this needs some finessing in a revision. As Reviewer 1 states, if one wishes to offer a particular causal interpretation, evidence needs to be provided to support this; otherwise, one should instead emphasize the nature of the correlations and at most tentatively suggest causal hypotheses that could be further explored in future work.\n\nResponse\n\nWe agree with the editor and reviewer 1, and acknowledge that we should refrain from causal assertions in our correlational study. We replace all potential ambiguous/ misleading statements like \"media is a mirror to society\" with \"media and societal trends correlate with each other\". While establishing causality would have been a much stronger result, showing that with our present experimental setting is difficult without accounting for additional demographic, political, technological, and cultural factors along with establishing the ecological validity of such findings given the constraints of the confounding variables. Our effort is a step towards this direction, and future work should include more controlled studies. We highlight this in our updated conclusion and discussion sections.\n\nRevision\n\nAbstract\n\nProfessions that employ more people have showed increased media frequency, supporting our hypothesis that media acts as a mirror to society.\n\nLines 686-688\n\nIn this section, we test the hypothesis that media stories reflect real-world events study the correlation between media frequency and real-world events, namely employment figures.\n\nLines 697-698\n\nTherefore, the trend of media frequency mirrors correlates with the employment trend for most SOC groups.\n\nLines 798-802\n\nWe observed a significant positive correlation between media frequency and employment trends of most SOC groups. Professions that typically employ more people were also more frequently mentioned in media content. We note that these correlation findings do not imply causality; a question that requires further systematic study.\n\nLines 831-832\n\nImportantly, future work should also consider investigating causal relations, beyond correlations, between media representations and employment trends.\n\nComment 3\n\nAt the same time, Reviewer 1 notes that the manuscript presents a body of facts, but does not offer possible explanations for them - so clearly some speculation is to be appreciated, as long as it is presented as such.\n\nResponse\n\nWe have reworked the discussion section to suggest possible reasons behind the observed media frequency and sentiment trends. We could not always find proper references to support our hypotheses, and sometimes even found published studies contradicting our media trends. We have included the relevant published work and have tried our best to explain the media trends.\n\nRevision\n\nLines 717-720\n\nWe observed that gender-neutral terms like massage therapists and flight-attendants are\n\nbecoming more frequent than their gendered counterparts. We suggest that this trend is\n\ndue to the increased awareness stemming from conversations about gender-neutral\n\nterms among the youth, parents, and the LGBTQ+ community [76, 77].\n\nLines 720-727\n\nAnalyzing explicit gendered profession terms, we observed that the frequency of some female job titles such as waitresses, congresswomen, and policewomen has either increased or\n\nremained steady relative to the corresponding male job titles (i.e., waiters, congressmen,\n\nand policemen). Equal opportunity legislation, women’s rights movements [78], and\n\nconstitutional amendments for women’s suffrage [79] have improved the representation\n\nof women in police and government. This may have driven a similar trend of increasing\n\nfemale representation in media content\n\nLines 730-736\n\nThe frequency of STEM, sports, arts, and design occupations has increased, whereas\n\nthe frequency of construction, farming, and manual labor jobs has decreased.\n\nImprovements in cinematography and visual effects technology, space travel, the\n\nemergence of the world wide web, and sports documentaries have contributed to the\n\nincreased fascination of science and sports in media [80, 81]. These advances and\n\ninterests potentially explain the increase in the frequency of STEM-related and sports\n\nportrayals on the big screen.\n\nWe have similarly revised the entire discussion section and offered possible hypotheses to explain the observed media trends.\n\nReviewer 1\n\nComment 1\n\nAbstract: \"Professions that employ more people have increased media frequency, supporting our hypothesis that media acts as a mirror to society.\" -- Let E be the levels of employment in various professions. Let F be the frequency of various words for professions. Let S be the sentiment of various words applied to professions. The sentence quoted here suggests that variation in E causes variation in F and S: that is, E is the real thing, whereas F and S are merely reflections (mirrors) of E. The paper makes it clear that E is correlated with F and S, but the paper does not demonstrate how the causal connection goes. There are (at least) three possibilities: (1) Variation in E causes variations in F and S. (2) Variations in F and S cause variations in E. (3) Variation in some other thing, X, causes variation in E, F, and S. All three of these causal connections seem possible to me, and it is not at all clear which is the actual connection. The authors need to either (A) be clear that they have only demonstrated correlation and not causation or (B) provide solid evidence that there is indeed a specific causal relation connecting E, F, and S. If the authors choose (A) (causation unknown), then they should remove all expressions, such as \"acts as a mirror\", that imply a specific causal relation. My guess is option (3): changes in technology (X) drive changes in the level of employment in various professions (E), they drive changes in sentiment towards various professions (S), and they drive changes in the frequency of various words for professions. But I have no rigorous evidence for this hypothesis.\n\nLines 676-677: \"In this section, we test the hypothesis that media stories reflect real-world events.\"\n\n-- The word \"reflect\" here is somewhat metaphorical. There is an implication that real-world events cause media stories. But perhaps media stories cause real-world events. Or perhaps both are caused by some third factor. All that the authors can say with certainty is that there is correlation. I would very much welcome some explicit discussion of causality in this paper, but I don't think it's right to smuggle causality into the paper using terms such as \"reflect\". If the authors are unable to firmly state that there is a certain causal connection, they could still offer some tentative hypotheses about causation.\n\nLines 726-720: \"Lastly, we observed that media frequency correlates with the employment trend of most SOC groups. Professions that employed more people were also more frequently mentioned in media content. This supports our hypothesis that media mirrors society and plays a role in our professional choices.\"\n\n-- Again, the word \"mirror\" suggests that society is the cause and media is the effect. This paragraph starts with \"correlates\" (quite rightly) and ends with \"mirrors\" (somewhat unscientific). I encourage some discussion of causality, but it should be explicit and straightforward, acknowledging the difficulty of causal analysis.\n\nResponse\n\nWe agree that correlation between E and F (or S) does not imply causation. It was not our intention to suggest so either. Therefore, we have rephrased all statements relating media trends and employment to explicitly contain the word “correlation”, and removed misleading statements like “media is a mirror to society”.\n\nRevision\n\nSame as the revision to the Editor's second comment (see above).\n\nComment 2\n\nLines 8-10: \"Cultivation theory suggests that prolonged exposure to the content we see on TV shapes our outlook and makes us believe that to be our reality [1].\"\n\n-- There should be some discussion of alternatives to Cultivation theory. For example: The Fruits of Cultivation Analysis: A Reexamination of Some Effects of Television Watching (pp. 287-302), Michael Hughes.\n\n-- https://www.jstor.org/stable/2748103\n\n-- Wikipedia says that there are two alternatives to Cultivation theory that are more widely used: \"In a 2004 study, surveying almost 2,000 articles published in the top three mass communication journals since 1956, Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron found that cultivation theory was the third most frequently utilized cultural theory.\"\n\n-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_theory\n\nResponse\n\nWe have provided some discussion on alternatives to Cultivation theory. This debate surrounding the relationship between television viewing and human behavior and beliefs suggests that we require better designed and more demographically inclusive surveys. We have added the suggested citations for completeness.\n\nRevision\n\nLines 8 - 15\n\nCultivation theory suggests that prolonged exposure to the content we see on TV shapes our\n\noutlook and makes us believe that to be our reality [1]. Several social studies have\n\nexplored the application of cultivation theory and confirmed its validity [2–4]. However,\n\nthere are social scientists that have also questioned the validity of the cultivation theory\n\nbecause it ignores socioeconomic factors [5], living conditions [6], and differences in the\n\nportrayal of violence on television [7]. Still, this discussion about television and the\n\ncultivation of beliefs inspires us to examine their relationship\n\nComment 3\n\nLines 553-557: \"The frequency trend of the SOC group does not reflect the frequency trend of all its professions. For example, Figs 8 e) and f) show increasing trends for many sales-related professions, but the overall frequency of the Sales Occupations SOC group decreased. A large proportion of Sales Occupations mentions are comprised of bankers and\n\ncashiers, whose frequencies have decreased.\"\n\n-- Do the authors have an explanation for this? The paper should not be merely a collection of facts. Perhaps it is difficult to prove an explanation is correct, however it would be useful to suggest some hypotheses.\n\nLines 569-570: \"Therefore, the number of positive sentiment mentions is greater than the number of negative sentiment mentions for all the SOC groups.\"\n\n-- Again, some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nLines 589-598: \"Fig 12 shows the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [...] also one of the most positive sentiment trends.\"\n\n-- Some hypothetical explanations would be of interest to the reader.\n\nResponse\n\nSimilar to the response to the Editor’s third comment, we have included possible hypotheses with relevant citations to explain the observed frequency and sentiment media trends. The analysis section contains the facts and the discussion section provides possible reasons for these facts.\n\nRevision\n\nSame as the revision to the Editor’s third comment.\n\nWe summarize our edits for the low level comments raised by reviewer 1 here:\n\nWe replace “like” with “such as” at the suggested places.\n\nWe replace “if” with “whether” at the suggested places.\n\nWe replace URLs with proper citations for the profession corpus, sentiment dataset, and sentiment algorithm.\n\nWe replace “males” and “females” with “men” and “women” respectively.\n\nWe expand the abbreviated forms of CRF and TAC KBP.\n\nWe describe the LCF BERT model in simpler terms.\n\nLines 386-391\n\nThe LCF model defines a value called semantic relative distance (SRD) for each word in the sentence. SRD is the absolute difference between the word position and the target (professional mention) position in the sentence. The model masks or weighs down the output features of words whose SRD is larger than some threshold, that is, the model reduces the effect of words that are farther away from the profession word in determining the sentiment.\n\nReviewer 2\n\nComment 1\n\nAlthough the data and methodology are clearly presented, I would have appreciated the authors pointing out more explicitly their limitations….Also, it would be relevant to underline the main limitations of the study and to provide recommendations for future research in computational social sciences especially in other national and linguistic contexts.\n\nResponse\n\nWe acknowledge that the earlier version of the manuscript lacked a discussion of the limitations of our work. While ours is the first large-scale computational analysis on the representation of professions in media subtitles, we can further improve our methods through more sophisticated modeling. Moreover, our domain choice limits the information we can glean about the media portrayal of professions. We have described these limitations and more at the end of the discussion section.\n\nRevision\n\nLines 803-820\n\nThere are several limitations of the present work. First, subtitles provide only a limited\n\nview of the complete movie or TV show. Features, such as the character’s behavior on\n\nscreen, their interactions with other people, and their character arc can only be studied\n\nby carefully viewing the entire movie or TV episode. Therefore, our representation\n\nmeasures of frequency and sentiment of job titles in subtitles do not capture all aspects\n\nof their media portrayal. Second, our frequency and sentiment analyses do not control\n\nfor the frequency or sentiment expressed toward these professions in everyday language.\n\nFor example, the frequency of policewomen might have been less than the frequency of\n\npolicemen in media subtitles because that is how their usage evolved in literature. A\n\npossible solution is to use the corresponding Google ngram frequencies [23] of the\n\nprofessional words as covariates in our analysis. Third, our study has primarily focused\n\non the representation of professions in the US and the UK (see the distribution of\n\nproduction country in section OpenSubtitles). One needs to adapt our proposed\n\ntaxonomy and models for different cultures and languages. Our profession taxonomy\n\ndoes not contain all job titles in other countries. Depending on the application of this\n\ntaxonomy, one may have to add professions specific to a local region for a\n\ncomprehensive study.\n\nComment 2\n\nThe discussion section need substantive rework. While it summarizes well the main results of the article, it fails to engage in a reflective discussion with the findings of other studies. The discussion part would benefit from citing more social sciences references supporting the idea that \"media mirrors society and plays a role in our professional choices\".\n\nResponse\n\nWe have reworked the discussion section extensively and provided possible reasons behind the observed media frequency and sentiment trends of professions.\n\nRevision\n\nPlease see the revision to the Editor’s third comment.\n\nReferences\n\nWe have not removed any previous references from our manuscript.
