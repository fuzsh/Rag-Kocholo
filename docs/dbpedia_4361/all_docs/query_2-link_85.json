        "text": "(Photo by New Line Cinema/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\n100 Worst Movies of All Time\n\nIt’s bad movies galore as we encounter the Rottenest of the Rotten: 100 movies that scored less than 6% (from at least 20 reviews) with the critics on the Tomatometer!\n\nYou’re going to see lots of 0% movies, and there’s even more out there, but the ones on this list all have at least 20 reviews. We wanted to make sure the movies we’re “vouching” for as the worst ever have inflicted a minimum threshold of agony on critics. And the 20-review entry applies for every other movie on this list, and that includes the usual suspects of garbage cinema, like the deep space train wreck Battlefield Earth, the box office turkey (turtle?) The Master of Disguise, Netflix’s lazy western The Ridiculous 6, and flaccid softcore Killing Me Softly (which also makes a dubious appearance in the 200 best and worst erotic movies).\n\nYou may also note a number of significant stinkers are from the past 20 years. It’s not just because Uwe Boll was employed during this time period. And, by the way, he’s actually beat by dubious directing duo Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who have four movies on the list. Instead, it’s the fact more reviews are being written and collected than ever before, so today’s disasters have a better chance of vaunting over 20 reviews. (And for movies that share the same score, more reviews means you’re placed higher within the ranking.)\n\nBut fret not: Plenty of yesteryear’s bombs are here. After all, the decade that produced Mac & Me has a lot to account for. Some of the classic trash featured includes the soul-sucking Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Speed 2: Cruise Control (see what happens when you throw Keanu overboard?), off-the-deep-end Jaws: The Revenge, and prime directive-violating RoboCop 3.\n\nWhat you won’t see: Some legendary bad movies like Cats, Birdemic, and The Room, all of which have cleared at least a 10% Tomatometer. That’s right, they were too good. And Miami Connection and Plan 9 From Outer Space are actually Fresh!\n\nMost recently, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey has squeezed in, the first movie to appear since 2020’s The Last Days of American Crime. Then we added the Alison Brie/John Cena joint Freelance.\n\nNow that we set the mood for truly bad movies, start the most painful watchlist you’ll ever make with the 100 worst movies of all time! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nBallistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) 0%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 3631%\n\nCritics Consensus: A startlingly inept film, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever offers overblown, wall-to-wall action without a hint of wit, coherence, style, or originality.\n\nSynopsis: Haunted by the mysterious death of his wife, Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) has become a recluse, but the former FBI...

His next...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Roberto Benigni\n\n#7\n\nSuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (2004) 0%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 742%\n\nCritics Consensus: A startling lack of taste pervades Superbabies, a sequel offering further proof that bad jokes still aren't funny when coming from the mouths of babes.\n\nSynopsis: Toddlers use their special abilities to stop a media mogul (Jon Voight) from altering the minds of children.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Bob Clark\n\n#8\n\nGold Diggers (2003) 0%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 751%\n\nCritics Consensus: It aspires to Farrelly-level offensiveness, but the PG-13 rating and a dearth of decent gags renders Gold Diggers tame, toothless, and dull.\n\nSynopsis: Calvin (Will Friedle) and Leonard (Chris Owen), two broke losers, are arrested for trying to rob rich old sisters Doris... [More]\n\nDirected By: Gary Preisler\n\n#9\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 1626%\n\nCritics Consensus: This Crime is punishment.\n\nSynopsis: Two men and a woman plan the heist of the century before a government-broadcast signal wipes out crime forever....

[More]\n\nDirected By: Joseph Sargent\n\n#11\n\nThe Ridiculous 6 (2015) 0%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 933%\n\nCritics Consensus: Every bit as lazily offensive as its cast and concept would suggest, The Ridiculous Six is standard couch fare for Adam Sandler fanatics and must-avoid viewing for film enthusiasts of every other persuasion.\n\nSynopsis: White Knife, an orphan raised by Native Americans, discovers that five outlaws are actually his half-brothers. Together, they set out... [More]\n\nDirected By: Frank Coraci\n\n#12\n\nDark Crimes (2016) 0%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 894%\n\nCritics Consensus: Dark Crimes is a rote, unpleasant thriller that fails to parlay its compelling true story and a committed Jim Carrey performance into even modest chills.\n\nSynopsis: A hard-boiled detective becomes suspicious of an author when the incidents described in his hit novel resemble the inner-workings of... [More]\n\nDirected By: Alexandros Avranas\n\n#13\n\nStratton (2017) 0%\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 1110%\n\nCritics Consensus: Stratton's action-thriller ambitions are roundly thwarted by a derivative story, misguided casting, and a low-budget feel underscored by unimpressive set pieces.\n\nSynopsis: After the death of his American counterpart, an MI6 agent and his team must race against time to stop a...

She begins...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Andrey Konchalovskiy\n\n#16\n\n#16\n\nAdjusted Score: 2182%\n\nCritics Consensus: Despite its lush tropical scenery and attractive leads, Return to the Blue Lagoon is as ridiculous as its predecessor, and lacks the prurience and unintentional laughs that might make it a guilty pleasure.\n\nSynopsis: When widow Sarah Hargrave (Lisa Pelikan) washes ashore on a tropical island with her daughter and adopted son, she learns...

(1994) 0%\n\n#17\n\nAdjusted Score: 1498%\n\nCritics Consensus: Wagons East! is a witless, toothless satire of Westerns that falls far below the standard set by Blazing Saddles, and is notable only for being John Candy's final screen performance.\n\nSynopsis: When a group of dissatisfied settlers decides they've had enough of the Wild West, they hire James Harlow (John Candy),...
