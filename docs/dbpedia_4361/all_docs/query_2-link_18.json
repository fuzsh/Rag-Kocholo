Through primary and secondary readings, lecture, and discussion, this course aims to advance students' understanding of specific ways in which the United States changed during this period.

How should museums and living history sites represent the horrors of the Holocaust or American slavery? When filmmakers, playwrights, composers, or choreographers explore historical events or people in their works, how do/should they navigate the intersecting terrain of historical ‘truth' and the imperatives of provocative storytelling? The work of history revolves around the question of “What happened in the past?” but also “How will/do we choose to remember the past?” What will be commemorated? What will be forgotten or erased? Whose stories get privileged, whose get silenced, and why? And how can we change those stories as time moves forward? Passionate debate flares around these questions, revealing lines of division, and providing us remarkable opportunities to study and participate in the evolving contours of American society and American democracy. This course will introduce students to the study of American memory practices through readings, viewings, field trips, and substantial reflection and discussion— focusing on signature case studies of tensions that have erupted around public monuments, museum exhibits, and feature films in the past century—as well as executing original research/design projects challenging them to create original, historically sensitive artifacts of public memory.\n\nHIS 2088\n\nIndependent Study\n\n1 to 3 credits\n\nIndependent Study is available in the following areas: ARH, FRE, GER, HIS, HUM, ITA, LIT, MAT, MST, PHI, PSY, SCI, THH, WRI.

Through lectures, discussion, secondary readings, and primary texts, this course will engage the key issues in American public education from the early Republic through the post-WWII period, paying special attention to the founding principles of the common school movement, the belief that an informed citizenry was essential to a democratic polity, and the unfinished struggle to realize that ideal in practice. Among the course's central issues will be how the categories of race, gender, and religion have shaped the history of learning and educational opportunity, how notions of citizenship and selfhood have evolved in close relationship with strategies of pedagogical reform, the history of arts education, debates over educational testing, and the various “crises” of public education in the post-WWII era.

Prerequisite(s):ENG 1200\n\nHIS 2800\n\nThe Arts & Democracy in American Life\n\n3 credits\n\nArtists and arts advocates in the United States, and around the world, have often argued that a thriving artistic culture is indispensable to a democratic society. But why? When did the “arts and democracy” argument crystallize? Ultimately, is the argument persuasive? This course will look to key episodes and themes—from the early republic to today—which illuminate the relationship between the arts and the stated values and goals of democracy. These might include debates over the aesthetic representation of the nation, the movement to include arts education in public schools, debates over public subsidies for the arts during the New Deal and 1960s, the deployment of artists as agents of Cold War cultural diplomacy, and the revived debates about public support for the arts during the “culture wars” of recent decades. Students will also grapple with complex questions such as: What is “democracy” and what are “democratic values”? What role should art play in the formation of citizens? What are the proper boundaries of expressive freedom? And do artists, arts managers, and leaders in the arts and cultural sector have a particular type of political responsibility or civic obligation to advance a culture of social justice, equity, and inclusion within arts organizations and beyond? Students will engage with course material through a wide variety of readings, written reflections, class discussion, and projects. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200\n\nHIS 2900\n\nTalkin' Freedom: The 1st Amendment and Censorship in US History\n\n3 credits\n\nOne could argue that the edges of any artist's creative “palette,” at least in the United States, are defined by the 1st Amendment. But where does an American's freedom of expression begin and end? How have the boundaries of expressive freedom changed over time? Why, and by what means? When, and why, has it been deemed proper to limit or censor that freedom to curb ‘indecency' or to serve the interests of public safety, child protection, or national security? The 1st Amendment's place in the US Constitution was secured in 1791, but its legal reach and its real meaning continues to occupy a central and contested place in our political culture. This course will study the historical precedents and origins of the 1st Amendment and various episodes in which it has taken center stage with regard to political speech, the arts, the press, and new “speech” arenas opened up by contemporary technology. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200\n\nHIS 3088\n\nIndependent Study: 3088 Level\n\n1 to 3 credits\n\nIndependent Study is available in the following areas: ARH, FRE, GER, HIS, HUM, ITA, LIT, MAT, MST, PHI, PSY, THH, WRI. An Independent Study is a contract between a highly motivated student and a Liberal Arts faculty member. It is entirely at the discretion of the faculty member whether or not to accept an Independent Study. Independent Study at the 3088-level in intended for third and fourth-year students with special academic interests not served by the regular schedule of classes. Independent Studies are not offered for courses already listed in the Bulletin. Students may earn a maximum of 6 semester hours in Independent Studies toward the degree. Independent Study forms can be obtained from the office of the Division of Liberal Arts. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHIS 3100\n\nWar, Resistance & American Culture\n\n3 credits\n\nResistance to war is sometimes thought of as a recent phenomenon as witnessed during the Vietnam War and the current war in Iraq. Yet American colonial records show conscientious objectors as early as 1658. In 1815, the Massachusetts Peace Society was established, and by the early 1820s there were over a dozen local peace societies in the United States. This course will examine the nature of peace and anti-war movements in the 19th and 20th centuries. We will consider theological and philosophical underpinnings of these movements and how the rhetoric and action of these movements affected American culture. Prerequisite(s): HUM 2101.\n\nHIS 3300\n\nPolitics & Culture of the Cold War\n\n3 credits\n\nBetween 1945 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the United States and the U.S.S.R. squared off against each other in a ‘Cold War'. Whether through so-called proxy wars on Third World continents, athletic competitions and cultural exchanges internationally, or the McCarthy hearings and civil preparedness drills domestically, the Cold War served as an undercurrent in the U.S. during this period. This course examines the political issues surrounding the Cold War and how those issues influenced/affected American culture after World War II. Prerequisite(s): HUM 2101.\n\nHIS 3400\n\nCulture and Terrorism\n\n3 credits\n\nUntil the Oklahoma City bombing and the attacks on September 11, 2001, terrorism was a phenomena that, in the opinion of many Americans, occurred elsewhere. Beginning with a history of terrorism, this course will explore the culture of terrorism and the relationships between terrorism and culture, as well as the underlying political issues by examining a variety of cultural media. How have artists, in the broadest sense of the word, responded to it, used it as a theme and been used by it? We also seek to understand how the ideals and martyrs for a cause are kept in the public consciousness through literature, film, popular and contemporary music and music videos. Prerequisite(s): HUM 2101.\n\nHUM 1198\n\nTopics in Humanities\n\n3 credits\n\nOne-semester intensive studies in which the instructor and students are challenged to examine some facet of the Western humanistic tradition. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor\n\nHUM 1210\n\nPerformance Art\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course is designed to explore developments in the field of Performance Art. We will examine the impact that John Cage, Gertrude Stein, “Happenings,” Modern and Postmodern Dance and postmodernism had on the contemporary performance of Laurie Anderson, Chris Burden, Karen Finley, and others.\n\nHUM 1220\n\nWinston-Salem Stories\n\n3 credits\n\nWinston-Salem is a historically significant American city, one with a past as fascinating and complicated as the region and country of which it's a part. Like so many communities, today's Winston-Salem is confronting a host of challenges and opportunities—around issues of race and social justice, diversity and education, gentrification and neighborhood change, environmental concerns and the quest for sustainable growth, profound economic inequality, and the ongoing effort to develop a post-industrial economy in a city that once soared as a tobacco and textile manufacturing capital. In this course, students will gain a better understanding of how UNCSA's home city developed over time and about the historical roots of contemporary conditions. This broader understanding will be achieved through a variety of readings, films, field trips, guest speakers and discussion. Additionally, students will work on a substantial creative project involving historical research and will produce original stories in various formats that connect Winston-Salem's past to its present.\n\nHUM 1240\n\nHappy Trails to You: The American Cowboy in Literature and Film\n\n3 credits\n\nThe course traces the emergence and evolution of the American cowboy in literature and film over the past century and a half and further explores the impact of changing cultural and media contexts on that icon.\n\nHUM 2088\n\nIndependent Study\n\n1 to 3 credits\n\nIndependent Study is available in the following areas: ARH, FRE, GER, HIS, HUM, ITA, LIT, MAT, MST, PHI, PSY, SCI, THH, WRI. An Independent Study is a contract between a highly motivated student and a Liberal Arts faculty member available. It is entirely at the discretion of the faculty member whether or not to accept an Independent Study. Independent Study at the 2088-Level is intended for second-year students with special academic interests not served by the regular schedule of classes. Independent Studies are not offered for courses already listed in the Bulletin. Students may earn a maximum of 6 semester hours in Independent Studies toward the degree. Independent Study forms can be obtained from the office of the Division of Liberal Arts. Prerequisite: ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2100\n\nCritical Dialogues\n\n3 credits\n\nIn this core humanities course, students encounter exemplary texts from antiquity to the present and from multiple continents and diverse cultures. How do we make meaning from this expansive record of storytelling, inquiry, and creative expression? How can today's artist-citizens respond as active conversation partners across time and space? Specific content and thematic emphases will vary across course sections, reflecting the diverse specializations and perspectives of Division of Liberal Arts faculty. In all sections, however, students will wrestle both with texts long privileged as 'canonical' and, of equal importance, others that speak from the margins and compel us to think critically about how we assign value and importance to different voices and traditions. All sections also share one significant contemporary text (selected annually). “Critical Dialogues” students will cultivate their skills of research, writing, and verbal expression, and in doing so, situate their artistic and professional practice in specific contexts and as woven into a larger world of ideas. Prerequisite: ENG 1200 or equivalent\n\nHUM 2101\n\nSelf, Society and Cosmos\n\n3 credits\n\nAn in-depth examination of some of the fundamental texts that contribute to the conversation about the essentials of the human condition. Readings will include texts from a variety of traditions and disciplines, including philosophy, literature, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and the arts. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200 or equivalent.\n\nHUM 2102\n\nPaths to the Present: Birth of the Modern World\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course explores the processes by which nations moved into the modern age. Key to this exploration will be our investigation of the transformations that occurred in the wake of the great revolutions: scientific, industrial, political (1688, American, French and Russian), cultural and technological. How did they transform societies? What were, and continue to be, the consequences and legacies of these revolutions? Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2103\n\nPaths to the Present: Making Modern Art\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course looks at the emergence of Modernity as pictured in art. Most signposts along this path announce -isms: Mannerism, Caravaggism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Expressionism... and those just lay out the first steps of the game of defining Modernism. We will examine what this flurry of artistic doctrines and schools indicates about the Artist in Modernity and about Modernity itself, seeking understanding of the role of artistic production in evaluating history and the role of artists in understanding the contemporary moment. Readings come from the artists themselves, their critics, and theorists from our own time. Prerequisite: HUM 2101.\n\nHUM 2104\n\nPaths to the Present: The Aesthetics of Dissonance\n\n3 credits\n\nShould artists knowingly create works of art that are abrasive, demanding, confusing, offensive, or just plain annoying? This is one of the central aesthetic questions posed at the dawn of the modern era. The work of the Romantics, Symbolists, Futurists, Dadaists, and Surrealists set the tone for artistic exploration for much of the 20th century by challenging traditional aesthetic models and focusing on process over product. In doing so they established methodologies, strategies, and criteria that contributed to the development of the modern world. Taught with an eye toward theoretical positions as well as practical examples, we will explore, examine, contemplate, criticize, and theorize about works of art that define an aesthetics of dissonance. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2105\n\nPaths to the Present: Literature and the Modern World\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course is designed to explore revolutionary and evolutionary epistemological shifts in thought and literary practice from the nineteenth century forward. In an increasingly global literature that provides a multiplicity of models while rejecting traditional authority and community consensus, new work challenges, arises out of and depicts mental and emotional isolation, alienation, social discord and skepticism. We will trace literary shifts as well as changes in systems of knowledge. Through examinations of oral, written and/or dramatic literary genres and the writers and thinkers who create and practice them, we aim to examine the ideas that shape structure, conventions, subject matter and critical theory in response to the literatures. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2106\n\nPath to the Present: The History and Philosophy of Science\n\n3 credits\n\nThe purpose of this course is to use the “lens of science” to explore concepts such as evidence, fact, scientific worldview, and falsifiability. During the first half of the course, we will study contributions made by Ptolemy, Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein in order to trace the progression of scientific thought. In the second half of the course, we will investigate new developments in science, such as relativity, quantum mechanics, and genetics, and discuss how these theories impact our current worldview. Prerequisite: HUM 2102\n\nHUM 2107\n\nPaths to the Present: History of Psychology\n\n3 credits\n\nDiscussion of prescientific thinking on psychological problems, origin of systems of psychology, and ways systems are reflected in contemporary psychology. Beginning with ancient Greek science, the course will cover the scientific revolution, and Newtonian Psychologists. This would lead to the rise of physiology and the birth of psychology. The course will include the biological psychology of Wundt, Psychoanalysis and Freud, Behaviorism, Humanistic psychology, culminating with the cognitive revolution and the push toward a sociocultural perspective. The course will move from the philosophical beginnings of psychology to the modern day version that is largely tied to the medical model of disease and disorder. Further, the Darwinian influence on present day psychology is large, and will be discussed at length. Prerequisite: HUM 2101.\n\nHUM 2108\n\nPaths to the Present: American Ideas\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course will examine the key intellectual currents in American thought from the post-Civil War era of Reconstruction into contemporary times. Students will explore developments in the areas of philosophy, science, political and social criticism, the arts and culture, and in conceptions of race, gender, and sexuality in order to better understand how American thinkers have made sense of and commented upon the modern condition. Special attention will be given to how developments in these areas have both drawn upon and found expression in the work of major American artists during the past century, as well as in the work of a variety of contemporary intellectuals who are writing and blogging today. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2109\n\nPaths to the Present: Postmodernity\n\n3 credits\n\nThe idea of “post” indicates the development of a hybridity that suggests both past and future simultaneously. It is a periodizing concept used to identify and reflect upon the development of modernity and its consequences. This course is designed to explore the world created in the wake of modernism by focusing on the idea of “post” in all its many and varied forms: structuralism, modernism, semiotics, dramatic, digital, racial, punk, rock, human. Each of these terms suggests a pathway from one idea to the next that would not be possible without the initial modernist ideal. Each term listed above is a category while also beyond category, indicative of artworks and methods of analysis that are not funneled into a solitary meaning but exceed the boundaries of a stable and well-ordered system. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2110\n\nPaths to the Present: The Urban Experience\n\n3 credits\n\nModernity is a fundamentally urban phenomenon. During modernity, humans increasingly migrated into cities that grew ever bigger and more complex. Modern cities, moreover, offered new types of everyday experience and resulted in an \"urbanization\" of basic patterns of living and of human consciousness itself. In this course, students will study the evolution of cities in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the connection between urban growth and other primary forces of modernization—secularism, political revolution, industrialization, market capitalism, and technology. Particular attention will be paid to the social and cultural reorganizations produced by these historical forces, as well as to the physical urban landscapes where various modernisms—aesthetic and intellectual responses to modernization—found material expression. Course participants will engage with a variety of theoretical and historical literatures that have considered how urbanization altered the experience of space and time, work and leisure, and the line between private and public life, and even reached into the intimate confines of bodily and psychological subjectivity. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2111\n\nPaths to the Present: History of Suburbia\n\n3 credits\n\nMany of us grew up in a suburban neighborhood and have been shaped by its ideals and concerns. It is at once a demographic, a physical and a cultural terrain. This course examines the historical foundations for the suburb, its development in Europe and America during the 19th and 20th centuries, the suburban ideal and its representation in popular culture including advertisements, novels, movies and television. The critical questions driving our inquiry: How have suburbs shaped American culture? How have cultural values shaped the suburb? What has been, and continues to be, the role of technology as a key component of suburban life? Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2112\n\nPaths to the Present: Various Topics\n\n3 credits\n\nTeam-taught on a rotation model, this option takes 3 or 4 separate sections of Paths to the Present, all taught at the same time, and links them together. Each instructor will meet with each section of students in a rotation, with students returning to the original instructor for midterm exams and the end of term. The sections are interconnected by a common theme or topic. The common theme could be as simple as the question, \"What defines the modern world?\", with each 2-3 week rotation to a new faculty member introducing students to a different approach, or argument. Or, alternatively, a team of instructors could construct a team-taught rotation around a narrower theme—e.g. \"The Real,\" \"Sound,\" \"Monsters/Monstrosity,\" \"Creativity,\" \"Mind/Body,\" \"Order/Disorder,\" \"Paradigm Shifts,\" \"Zero,\" or \"Chaos,\" etc.—with each instructor illuminating the significance of the topic through a different lens. Prerequisite: HUM 2101\n\nHUM 2113\n\nPaths to the Present: Science and Literature\n\n3 credits\n\nIn a letter to the playwright Arthur Schnitzler, the “father of modern psychology” Sigmund Freud wrote, “whenever I've immersed myself in your beautiful creations I have again and again believed I've found the very same preconditions, interests and results that I recognized as my own. (...) I thus came to the conclusion that you know everything through intuition (...) that I have discovered through strenuous work on other people.” This course will examine Freud's claim by taking a close critical look at some famous historical milestones along the “paths to the present” of science on the one hand and literature on the other. Rather than simply confirming the commonly-assumed binary opposition between these two humanistic practices, our examination of these milestones will encourage us as well to consider the often surprisingly parallel and complementary ways in which modern and post-modern literature and science represent our reality. This will be a “seminar-style” course, meaning its structure will be based on students' consistent, committed, and active participation and preparation. Prerequisites: ENG 1200 or equivalent\n\nHUM 2198\n\nAdvanced Topics in Humanities\n\n3 credits\n\nOne-semester intensive studies in which the instructor and students are challenged to examine some facet of the Western humanistic tradition. Prerequisite: ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2200\n\nPaths to the Present\n\n3 credits\n\nPaths to the Present courses use a single topical focus as an analytical lens to provide students with a historical perspective on the contemporary world. Topics vary across course sections, reflecting the diverse specializations and perspectives of DLA faculty. Paths to the Present students will continue to cultivate the skills developed in Critical Dialogues and, in doing so, situate their creative and scholarly practice in historical contexts and a larger world of ideas.\n\nHUM 2260\n\nGerman Expressionist Literature and Film\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course introduces students to representative examples of Expressionism from German-language literature, drama and film from around the turn of the last century until roughly 1930. Some attention will also be given to essays and to painting and architecture from this same period. Based primarily on close critical reading, viewing, and active discussion of the works in question, students should gain a good basic understanding of the major concerns of Expressionism, a familiarity with its preferred themes and stylistic characteristics and an awareness of the contributions of this movement to the arts in general. In addition, the different forms should enhance students' appreciation of the potential and actual interrelation of the visual, literary and dramatic arts. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200.\n\nHUM 2290\n\nStudies in Popular Culture\n\n3 credits\n\nIn this course we will consider an aspect of popular culture, for example popular music, rock and roll, comic books, or archetypes such as “lost boys.” The course focus will vary each term that it is offered, but, regardless of the material, we will consider issues of race, gender, authenticity, technology, politics, narrative, sound, and the nature of genre. We also will consider how popular forms and works reflect particular cultural moments, and, in turn, whether they exert any cultural influence. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2340\n\nCreativity and the Artist\n\n3 credits\n\nCombining psychology, biography and the aesthetics of the arts, this course looks at the best current theoretical literature exploring the seminal elements of creativity. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1102, ENG 1200 or equivalent.\n\nHUM 2400\n\nMindfulness Meditation and Education\n\n3 credits\n\nIn this course students learn a variety of mindfulness mediation skills in the contexts of: 1) the Koru Mindfulness framework (a framework that is specifically intended for an audience of emerging adults), 2) body/mind health dynamics (associated with mindfulness-based stress reduction or MBSR), 3) philosophical/cultural dynamics (e.g., dualism vs. nondualism), and 4) the educational and political dimensions of mediation. Open to second year (or higher) students. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200.\n\nHUM 2410\n\nThe American Twenties\n\n3 credits\n\nJazz. Flappers. Suffragettes. The Harlem Renaissance. Car culture. Airplane travel. The rise of skyscrapers. The rise of the film industry. The rise of the Klan. Monkey Trials. Modernism. Much of what we consider to be “modern” in art, literature, and living developed in the 1920s. It was a decade of astounding technological advances and social change. In this course we will examine some of the works, attitudes and movements. We will look at a variety of materials including novels, plays, music, art, and movies. Prerequisite(s):ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2420\n\nThe American Thirties\n\n3 credits\n\nFrom the novels of John Steinbeck to the photographs of Dorothea Lange, the 1930s was a decade of remarkable art. In dance, there were the joyous cinematic explosions of Astaire and Rogers, the spectacles of Busby Berkeley, and the grueling rise in “dances of dance,” marathons of desperation and endurance. Film developed from early talkies to some of film's greatest achievements. In this course, we will look at these as well as other aspects of the Great Depression. We will examine some of the works, attitudes and movements. We will look at a variety of materials including novels, plays, music, visual art, and movies. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200.\n\nHUM 2440\n\nStudies in American Humor\n\n3 credits\n\nIn this course, we will focus on one artist or group of artists, such as Woody Allen or the Marx Brothers, and explore the development and significance of their work. In doing so, the course also will explore issues of humor, including parody, ethnic stereotypes, the distinction between high and low culture, and the flexibility of language. Additional topics may include the significance of Vaudeville and the way comedy differs from page to stage to screen. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200 .\n\nHUM 2700\n\nGerman Romanticism\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course presents students with some of the major literary, artistic and philosophical works of German-language Romanticism. In examining and discussing these works, students will gain a better understanding and appreciation of the artistic richness of the period, of the major aesthetic concerns that underlie this production, and of the debt that works of various subsequent epochs and various artistic forms owe to German-language Romanticism. Students will also practice and hone their critical thinking skills and their written and oral expression. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2720\n\nThe Monster as Metaphor\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course will explore how we use monsters as metaphors in literature and film to explore the relationships between the human and non-human, male and female, “normal” and “abnormal”, healthy and sick. We will apply the psychological and literary theories of Freud, Lacan, and others to give perspective on the concept of the monstrous. Prerequisite(s): ENG 1200\n\nHUM 2740\n\nVariations\n\n3 credits\n\nIn this course, we will look at the “variations” of a particular work or narrative or variations on a theme. For example, one term might be devoted to “Hamlet Variations,” such as John Updike's novel, Gertrude and Claudius and Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Or, we might consider the multiple retellings of the Faust myth and the selling of one's soul. Or, we might consider either The Odyssey or “Ulysses in America.” We will look at a variety of materials including novels, plays, music, visual art, and movies.
