        "text": "By 1991, a large percentage of Americans had either heard gangsta rap or at least heard of gangsta rap. So many moral watchdogs were so busy debating the language and terminology in this musical subgenre that few actually dug into what the lyrics reflecting in regards to the real world — how, to paraphrase non-gangsta-rapper Chuck D., these songs were partially doubling as Black America’s CNN at the time. John Singleton’s movie took a lot of elements from this type of West Coast hip-hop (the title itself is from an instant-classic Eazy E song; Ice Cube plays one of the leads), stripped them of their sensationalistic bravado, yet kept the urgency and the sense of reportage. This, it said, is the good, the bad, and the ugly of what it’s like to live in “the hood” in L.A. There’s joy, there’s a sense of community, and in the presence of Larry Fishburne’s dream-dad Furious Styles, there are folks looking out for the kids and looking out for one another. There’s also fascist cops, racist authorities, the constant sound of helicopters and confrontations that escalate with the speed of a gunshot. It’s a time capsule of an American place at a specific moment. And it’s not a coincidence that the first thing you see is the word “STOP.” —D.F.\n\nNo filmmaker had more affection for everyday Americans than Jonathan Demme — his work brims with a love of the polymorphic mix that makes up the U.S. of A.’s populace, even (especially) the cracked, the kooky and the perpetually daydreaming. You immediately understand why he might have been attracted to the story of one Melvin Dummar, a gentleman who simply wants to be recognized Milkman of the Month and keep his possessions from being repossessed. One night, he picks up an old man hitchhiking on the side of the road. They chat, a little. They sing “Bye Bye Blackbird.” Dummar drops his new friend off at a hotel in Las Vegas. Soon, it comes to light that eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes has passed away, and has left a good deal of his fortune to a kind stranger, who once gave him a ride late one night…. Demme isn’t interested whether or not Dummar’s claim to those gifted riches is legit or not; he’s much more intrigued by what happens to those who chase the American Dream, and what happens when those who, say, tap-dance on gameshows to get rich suddenly find themselves on the verge of having something like that dream unexpectedly come true. —D.F.\n\nAmerica’s origin myth is heavy on rational men writing impassioned letters to other rational men with rational objections to their Enlightenment ideals. That belief is put to the test in Paul Schrader’s film, which asks the question: How can humanity be essentially good when we destroy our world and each other with so little thought? Ethan Hawke’s Reverend Ernst Toller is a simple man, living an austere lifestyle in service to a historical church in upstate New York. He embodies the modest intellectualism of Thoreau and Emerson — but the world as he sees it is not a place where justice ultimately prevails. The stormy crisis of faith that follows reflects the despair felt by many who were taught that America could reason its way out of any crisis, and whose trust in humanity is continually challenged in a cruel, bleak world that only seems to get crueler and bleaker. —K.R.\n\nIt’s a key document of the early, rough ‘n’ ready days of “the prime expression of a new young people’s subculture called ‘hip-hop,'” specifically bombing trains and breakdancing. (MC-ing, regrettably, is mostly AWOL.) And it’s easy to view Tony Silver’s seminal documentary as little more than a history lesson, a snapshot of Ed Koch’s NYC, or a sort of Deadline-style report on this new fad among mostly Latinx and African-American kids in the boogie-down Bronx, where, like, they’re vandalizing subways and spinning on their heads! Yet to revisit this look at what was happening in the outer boroughs — and would soon be bleeding into downtown Manhattan, and far beyond — is to watch a portrait of a truly American art form just beginning to find its feet. You don’t just get to see legends like Richard “Crazy Legs” Colón and Donald “DONDI” White and the Rock Steady Crew in action. You also get a fly-on-the-wall view of the scene’s infighting; how underground movements risk getting co-opted (that gallery sequence!); how youth culture thrives when bumping up against authority and why, to live outside the law, you must be honest; and see folks debate who gets to call what “art.” Everybody, keep rockin’ and clockin’ and shockin’! —D.F.\n\nIn 1901, in the town of Kenedy, Texas, a Mexican husband and father named Gregorio Cortez (Edward James Olmos) shot a lawman in self-defense. After taking his wounded brother to a neighbor’s house, he fled the scene; a posse of Texas rangers chased him for two weeks before capturing him and forcing him to stand trial for murder. This recounting of Lone-Star-State lore by director Charles M. Young (whose 1977 work Alambrista! was one of the rare, early American independent movies to focus on the plight of the migrant worker) follows the story made popular by the age-old corrido about the crime, but isn’t content to merely print the legend. It also shows you what happened from a number of perspectives, including Cortez’s account, and thus gives you a better sense of how a misunderstanding around language and a longstanding prejudice against immigrants led to tragedy. A landmark of Chicano cinema, Ballad recreated turn-of-the-century border life, reminded us that the justice system in this country has always been skewed, and showed how — with the help of the media and a song — a humble farmer could morph into a folk hero. —D.F.\n\nSean Baker’s breakout film was initially known as “the iPhone movie,” and indeed the ingenuity behind this $100,000 feature is as American as a fist fight in a donut-shop parking lot on Christmas Eve. Look beyond the gimmick, however, and you’ll find a portrait of the true diversity of our country, a land of immigrants and strivers where a Black transgender sex worker can strike up a friendship with an Armenian cab driver (her favorite client). What binds them all is a stubborn will to survive and be themselves, no matter the cost. Alexandra (Mya Taylor), the film’s protagonist, pays to sing in a nightclub for the pure joy of expressing herself on stage, and her bond with her best friend Sindee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) is stronger than the most hateful heckler or most manipulative fuckboy. It’s an American dream formed on the streets of Hollywood, modest but equally valid. —K.R.\n\nHolly (Sissy Spacek) is a 15-year old majorette in a quaint South Dakota town. Kit (Martin Sheen) is the antisocial, cold-blooded murderer with the James Dean vibe who charms her. After he murders her father (Warren Oates), the two go on the lam in order to evade the law, another fugitive couple on the run. Based loosely on the story of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate’s murder spree in 1958, Terrance Malick’s debut film brims with its own outlaw spirit, as well as his love of Midwest Americana: the fields of grain, the vintage signage, the myth of the lawless frontier and the folk legends it creates. These characters are rebels without a cause, a care or a moral compass. He doesn’t lionize them or condemn them. They’re as much as part of the landscape, in Malick’s eyes, as the open road. —R.D.\n\nCovering the AIDS epidemic from the start and from the frontlines made journalist David France uniquely qualified to open a window into that tragic chapter in American history. Yet his archival, boots-on-the-ground documentary is more than just a snapshot of a devastating moment or a timeline of a movement. Per its title, it’s also a kind of guidebook for budding activists, finding stirring engagement lessons in a community’s fight for lives and against a government indifferent to the loss of them. When we talk about organized resistance in America, it’s often in regards to the unrest of the ’60s. How to Survive a Plague is a powerful reminder that the rebellious spirit of that era lives on in the battles of later ones, and that there’s power in numbers, even when those numbers are dwindled by the very threat they’re meeting head on. —A.A.D.\n\nOr: How the West Was Won, one glorious fart at a time. (Is there anything more American than a bunch of men sitting around a campfire and literally talking out of their asses?) Part parody of Westerns and part old-fashioned gross-out comedy, Mel Brooks’ story of a Black sheriff recruited by a corrupt attorney general — the idea being that the citizens of the quaint frontier town of Rock Ridge would never accept an African-American lawman, and thus leave their value property ripe for the taking — is still a strong contender for the funniest movie ever made. But thanks to a killer screenplay cowritten by Richard Pryor, who Brooks had wanted to cast as the lead, the movie is playing with dynamite, and not just in the scenes featuring literal TNT. There are racial stereotypes galore, played for laughs in the most subversive ways imaginable; Brooks and Co. also take it for granted that prejudice and bigotry are as much part of the American landscape as tumbleweeds and the craggy mountains of Monument Valley. And yet Cleavon Little’s Bart still triumphs over the rednecks and racists and wins over the town’s respect. He even rehabilitates the town drunk, Gene Wilder’s Waco Kid — a role that Brooks offered to no less than John Wayne (!!!). Frontier mythology gets the revisionist hero it deserves. That, and some top-shelf fart jokes. —D.F.\n\nOrenthal James Simpson was a charismatic Black athlete who bridged this country’s racial divide — he embodied the American dream, proving to be an inspiration to kids who wanted to believe they too could overcome their circumstance. Director Ezra Edelman chronicles what happened after the happy ending, delivering an exhaustive, despairing snapshot of not just a man but also a nation. Just as thoughtful in its examination of Simpson’s sports career as his murder trial, this Oscar-winning documentary connects the dots between race, class, politics and stardom, illustrating how each of them impacted O.J. — and, also, how he came to symbolize the conflicting impulses within the country itself. Americans love a triumph-over-the-odds saga because we like telling ourselves fantasies. Made in America disabuses us of such fanciful notions, arguing that his sobering downfall couldn’t have happened in any other nation on Earth. —T.G.\n\nAmerican culture is driven by Black culture and queer culture. Full stop. So it should come as no surprise that Jenni Livingston’s 1990 documentary has turned out to be one of the most quietly influential films of the last 50 years. Merriam-Webster added “shade” to the dictionary in 2017, some 27 years after drag queen Dorian Corey broke down the term; RuPaul quotes the film verbatim on Drag Race, dispersing catchphrases and concepts that originated in the ballroom scene to viewers around the world. It’s a long way from a humid Harlem dance hall at 3 a.m., and many of the film’s subjects are no longer with us. But the irrepressible creativity and defiant joy of Black and Brown LGBTQ+ people in the face of oppression and death (this was the height of the AIDS crisis, don’t forget) still serves as a beacon and a lifeline, especially as America moves into another dark period for gender rebels and sexual minorities. —K.R.\n\nMartin Scorsese’s movies hum with the electricity of New York — but never with as much paranoid energy as his poisonous tribute to the city’s ugly underside. Opening during America’s bicentennial year, offering a somber portrait of a nation reeling from Vietnam and descending into moral bankruptcy, Taxi Driver drew inspiration from Dostoevsky’s Notes From Underground, updating the tale to chronicle a mentally disturbed war vet, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), as he seeks a release from the anger and sexual frustration seething inside him. In this fever dream of a character study, politicians and pimps are equally disreputable, and a bad man with a gun roams the streets, looking for a suitable target. That this bad man is also our main character only makes the film’s indictment of America all the more stinging: Bickle’s deranged ramblings start to make a weird sort of sense once you see what this unstable country has done to him. —T.G.\n\nLess than two years after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, along came Hollywood to dramatize and valorize the investigative journalism so instrumental to his downfall. Alan J. Pakula’s thrilling newspaper procedural captures for posterity a monumental moment in American culture and politics, as seen through the truth-seeking eagle eyes of the reporters, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman), who broke the Watergate scandal. In one sense, it’s a time capsule of national awakening, immortalizing a sea change in the public’s perception of our government. (All future depictions of Washington as a shadow world of cloak-and-dagger conspiracies owe some debt of influence to this movie.) On the more hopeful front, the movie is also a tribute to a core American tenet, celebrating a free press through an appreciation of all the unglamorous legwork of shoe-leather muckraking. Time has, of course, rendered some aspects of its true story rather quaint. Remember, with bittersweet nostalgia, a time when elected officials were held accountable for their crimes? —A.A.D.\n\nLike several recent superb biopics, Ava DuVernay’s exploration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. isn’t some unwieldy cradle-to-grave portrait — rather, it’s laser-focused on a small but crucial segment of his life, an epochal moment that didn’t just define the man but also the country he sought to change. King (David Oyelowo) is committed to ensuring the passage of the Voting Rights Act, even when many in America — including sometimes-ally President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) — stand in furious opposition. History tends to simplify this civil rights leader’s legacy, painting him as a humble, peaceful protestor. But Selma corrects that narrative, giving us a brilliant tactician and determined warrior whose steely resolve in the face of virulent racism borders on the miraculous. DuVernay and her deft ensemble — including Carmen Ejogo, André Holland, Colman Domingo and Tessa Thompson — crafted a stirring drama rippling with urgency that’s now flecked with sorrow. King lived to see the Voting Rights Act made into law. He would be long gone when the Supreme Court blithely dismantled it in 2021. —T.G.\n\nNostalgia — whether it’s for a real paradise lost, an imaginary past, or something in between — is as American as baseball, apple pie, and a Mel’s Drive-In patty melt. And for George Lucas, yesterday’s utopia is Main St. on Modesto, California, circa 1962. His ambling, free-form look back at the days of his youth (he would have been 18 that year) watches how a handful of stories play out over the course of one long, crazy night. Will high school sweethearts Ron Howard and Cindy Williams break up? Will Richard Dreyfuss meet that mystery blonde in the white T-bird? Can hot rodder Paul LeMat beat fellow souped-up gearhead Harrison Ford in a drag race? Where they end up is less important than environment they cruise through, which takes place in the early 1960s but feels like a ’50s Americana Fever Dream of car culture, drive-in burger joints and Golden Oldies rock & roll. (Its wax-museum version of the time period is responsible for everything from the Happy Days extended universe to Sha Na Na getting a TV show.) The where-are-they-now disclaimer at the end punctures the spell, yet it still strives to capture a Norman Rockwell vision of Anytown USA in amber. “You can’t stay 17 forever,” Howard says. Maybe not, but like a lot of folks in his generation, he’s going to hold on to that moment as long as possible. —D.F.\n\nIt’s the American dream (one facet of it, anyway) is to own your own business. For Jo, an elderly Chinese-American taxi driver, that means getting a cab to call his own; his nephew, Steve, is going in on the deal with him. They just need to find Chan Hung, a local who owes them some money. Only the man is missing, and no one can find him. No one can even agree on who Chan really is. Forget it, guys — it’s San Francisco’s Chinatown. Wayne Wang’s debut film kicks the tires on buddy comedies and detective movies (it’s not a coincidence that the AWOL gent shares a name with a popular stereotypical investigator from past pulp fictions), but more importantly, it lets Asian-American characters and Asian-American culture take center stage. And it’s there in the spotlight that Wang and his collaborators both celebrate and interrogate a rich, versatile community that’s bound together by two common continents and fractured by a million other differences. —D.F.\n\nWhile Francis Ford Coppola lent the crimes of Italian-American gangsters the sweeping grandeur of Greek or Shakespearean tragedy, his New Hollywood peer adopted a dimmer, less romantic view. Drawing from the nonfiction account Wiseguy, Martin Scorsese’s ruthless, detail-oriented, decades-spanning procedural paints the Mafia as a boys’ club of immoral hotheads: taking what they want when they want it, disdainful of hard work, devoted to nothing but easy money, brute power, and desire. Even their supposed loyalty to each other is a joke, given that Henry Hill (the late Ray Liotta) and his fellow crooks are willing to murder or rat on their closest friends to protect themselves. Goodfellas presents organized crime as the ugly epitome of me-first enterprise — the “fuck you, pay me” mentality taken to its logical nightmare extreme. It’s really no wonder Scorsese has long been accused of glorifying these monsters: He had the guts to acknowledge the allure of living only for your own appetites, an American dream sweet only because it’s rotten. —A.A.D.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years for a Black woman director to have her movie distributed in theaters in the United States. That’s America, and so is the determination and grit it must have taken for writer-director-producer Julie Dash to get Daughters of the Dust made. The community featured in this hypnotic, stirring film is all-American as well: the Gullah Geechee people, former slaves whose isolation allowed them to preserve West African belief systems and ways of life. Its story is set at a pivotal point in Gullah history, as members of the Peazant family prepare to leave their island home off the coast of Georgia for the mainland. It’s the turn of the 20th century, and new ideas are in the air. Dash’s film documents the conflicting emotions experienced by the Peazant women as they try to reconcile their commitment to their ancestors and desire for self-determination. Ironically, the traditions rejected by the younger characters are now being reclaimed by African-Americans searching for their roots, which led to Beyoncé using the film as an aesthetic touchstone for her Lemonade visual album. —K.R.\n\nPlant your camera anywhere in America for five years and you’re bound to emerge with some essential truths about the country. The documentarian Steve James stumbled upon more than a few when his plans for a 30-minute PBS short about a local playground evolved into a long-term shooting commitment, spurred by the decision to just keep filming two Chicago teens (William Gates and Arthur Agee) hoping that their talents on the court will lead to glory in the NBA. With the scope of a great novel, Hoop Dreams captures milestones and setbacks, big games and holidays, joys and sorrows — it’s an intimate nonfiction epic of ordinary life in the city. But as its subjects grow older, and their aspirations collide with hard luck and high expectations, James’ footage begins to coalesce into a larger, more withering insight: For too many kids, athletics are less a road to somewhere better than an uncaring machine, chewing up their bodies and hopes alike. —A.A.D.\n\nSpike Lee’s fight-the-power masterpiece, the creative pinnacle of a career and a decade, hit theaters like a trash can hurled through a glass pane. While critics raved and moviegoers came out in droves, nervous pundits scaremongered that this portrait of a Brooklyn neighborhood exploding into violence on the hottest day of the year would inspire Black audiences to riot — a racist panic that only reinforced the film’s rejection of “post-racial America” as a naive fantasy. That Do the Right Thing has scarcely aged a day in three decades is a testament to its exhilarating style and powerhouse performances, but also a reflection of the sad truth that its teeming Bed-Stuy — a powder keg of tensions, inequities, and police brutality — remains a microcosm for the country at large. To ask if Lee’s Mookie “does the right thing,” as so many have for so many years, is to echo the handwringing of those more concerned for storefronts than the men choked to death outside of them. —A.A.D.\n\nShortly after that bellowing that endlessly quoted line about milkshakes and before delivering the spoken equivalent of a film-closing Fin intertitle, Daniel Plainview issues a savage parting gloat: “I told you I would eat you up.” The mad oil baron, played by a seething, Oscar-winning Daniel Day-Lewis, has made good on his threat to swallow his enemy whole. It’s the deranged climax of a battle waged across hours of runtime and decades of screentime — a grudge match to the death between twin forces of homegrown exploitation and manipulation. Like most of the movies written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, this towering, blazing derrick of a historical epic is a character study with an eye towards the character of a nation. Rewinding back to the turn of a 20th century ruled by bloodthirsty businessmen, Anderson excavates an origin story of modern avarice and ambition from the soil of an Upton Sinclair pageturner. What is Plainview’s bloody victory but the moment when capitalism finally, fully consumed Chrstianity to become the dominant belief system of America? —A.A.D.\n\nCharles Burnett’s tale of a spiritually exhausted slaughterhouse employee “working myself into my own hell” in post-riot Watts started out as a the filmmaker’s thesis project at UCLA; it’s now rightfully considered a key work of the L.A. Rebellion film movement and the sort of debut movie that invites comparisons to A Love Supreme and Leaves of Grass as much as other ’70s stories of scraping by. The family at the center of this free-flowing, lyrical en extremis drama are struggling in a city that still feels like its vibrating from past civil unrest, and the movie doubles nicely as a snapshot of a Southern California neighborhood at a certain time and a certain social intersection. But it’s also a work of extreme American beauty, from the shots of kids jumping across rooftops to a couple slow-dancing in their living room. (J. Hoberman called the movie “an urban pastoral,” and the description could not be more apt.) Issues over music rights kept the film out of circulation for years, which is ironic considering how the Black American music Burnett chose is such a vital ingredient to the sound and vision he’s gifting this portrait of African-American life; everyone talks about Dinah Washington’s “This Bitter Earth” playing over an intimate moment, but you also can’t beat a girl soulfully singing Earth, Wind and Fire’s “Reasons” to her doll. It eventually found the broader audience it had rightfully earned and got the modern-classic status it rightfully deserved — a tragedy turned into an American success story. —D.F.\n\nAmericans like to think their government functions according to a logical series of rules designed by men who had their best interests in mind. In reality, it works more like Chinatown. Set in an L.A. ruled by corruption, deception, and disregard for human life, Roman Polanski’s celebrated 1974 neo-noir has no faith in the system whatsoever. And lest a viewer take refuge in the naive thought that “the system may be broken, but people are good deep down,” amoral private eye J.J. Gitties (Jack Nicholson) uncovers shocking personal secrets as well as political ones in his quest to expose the invisible levers of power in the city. This capitalist noose-tightening is how the West was really won — although the film is set in 1937, it was inspired by the real-life “water wars” of the early 20th century. And while its worldview may be bleak, at least it’s honest. —K.R.\n\nIt’s impossible to separate this Oscar-winner from the political landscape in which it was released: Opening just a few weeks before Donald Trump’s election, Barry Jenkins’ deeply compassionate story of a young Black man’s quest to embrace his sexuality felt like a bulwark against the cruelty festering across the country. Playing Chiron during three crucial moments in his life, a trio of actors — Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes — tackle the homophobia and racism that bedevil America, with their quiet sighs and resigned eyes accruing a cumulative emotional weight that honors the myriad of stories that so rarely get told in Hollywood films. Indeed, to see Moonlight is to be forced to reckon with this nation’s heart of darkness, but also to marvel at the individuals who find their way to transcendence anyway. That’s not the rosy vision most people want to have of America, but this cinematic stunner suggests it’s the harsh, inequitable world that too many of our countrymen and women recognize all too well. —T.G.\n\n“I believe in America.” From that opening line, Francis Ford Coppola’s gangster epic announces itself as first and foremost a story about immigration, centering on a family that was denied access to the American dream, so they had to forge an illegitimate path instead. For all the power Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) wields from the shadows, his entire empire is devoted to making sure his children can live in the light. Though Coppola delivers on the gruesome pulp of Mario Puzo’s novel, his aversion to making a gangster film is precisely what makes The Godfather the greatest gangster film of them all. The tragedy of the Corleones is shared by all immigrants stranded in a country that fails to live up to its promises. —S.T.\n\nHas there ever been a more sprawling, shaggy, tragicomic portrait of the American experiment than Robert Altman’s musical mural of a movie? Made a year before our country’s bicentennial (and before we’d send a peanut farmer from the deep south to the White House), his ensemble piece about a bunch of disparate characters colliding into each other in the epicenter of country music is only partially about the city of the title. Yes, it’s hard to think of another place so associated with a specific art form (unless you count Hollywood), and Nashville’s spirit-of-’75 mix of Grand Ole Opry legends, old-time-religion practitioners, sensitive singer-songwriters, wannabe stars, hippies, conservatives and kitschy Americana is a perfect recipe for a rich commentary stew. The filmmaker had already pioneered a loosey-goosey way of recording that allowed for his cast to simultaneously share space on the soundtrack, and with this ambitious epic, he makes room for every voice sing. And scream. And say the most darnedest faux-folksy and off-the-cuff profound things.\n\nThe real subject isn’t just the Tennessee hot spot and home to Music Row, of course, but the union it’s part of. We’re a nation of superfans and superfreaks, hypocrites and holy rollers, kooks and assassins — Altman and screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury didn’t need weathermen to know which way the wind was blowing. There’s a place at the table for Ronee Blakly’s beloved Barbara Jean, a woman singing about down-home life while on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and Ned Beatty’s opportunistic huckster, and Keith Carradine’s straight-outta-Laurel-Canyon Lothario, and Jeff Goldblum’s easy rider. Not to mention a disturbed young man toting around a violin case. Even before the climactic rally for the rogue “Replacement Party” Presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker, the lines between politics and entertainment and violence in this side-eye glance at the U.S. of A. were already so blurry. They’re even blurrier now. Nashville begins with someone crooning how America must be doing something right if we’d been around 200 years. It ends someone onstage, standing next to a pool of blood, belting out “You may say I ain’t free/but it don’t worry me.” The gap between those two sentiments is the longitude and latitude where you find our cockeyed nation on the map. —D.F."
