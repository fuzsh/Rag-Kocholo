        "text": "Historic and Modern Adventurers\n\nIn 1934, 20-year-old Everett Ruess ventured into Utah’s canyonlands on a solo journey, and he was never seen again. The young adventurer had spent the previous few years on a quest for purpose and meaning, journeying alone with mules. He befriended many along the way, including famous photographer Dorothea Lange. He spent time learning to speak the Navajo language and even traded images with Ansel Adams. When he vanished, Ruess left behind a notable collection of letters, poems, journals, paintings and engravings depicting his journeys. Editor W.L. Rusho assembled these artifacts in \"Everett Ruess: A Vagabond for Beauty,\" a collection of the letters Ruess wrote to family and friends. For a deeper dive into Ruess’s life, consider David Robert’s \"Finding Everett Ruess: The Life and Unsolved Disappearance of a Legendary Wilderness Explorer.\"\n\nIn 1869, geologist John Wesley Powell led the Powell Geographic Expedition exploring the Green and Colorado Rivers, which run through Utah. Read Powell’s own take on his river adventures in his book, \"The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons” or enjoy Utahn Wallace Stegner’s account of Powell’s fascinating life and career in \"Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West.\" (Read: Chasing John Wesley Powell)\n\nWhen Aron Ralston set out alone in the Utah desert in 2003, he was planning a relatively short hiking and canyoneering trip. However, a dislodged boulder trapped him in a remote canyon, and he found himself seriously injured with no way to summon help. Ralston’s book \"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\" tells the tale of his quest to survive and the extreme measures he took to make it out alive (also made into the movie starring James Franco, 127 Hours). While the book makes for a gripping read, it also serves as a reminder about precautions that need to be taken if traveling alone in the wilderness.\n\nThe Classic Works of Edward Abbey\n\nAn exploration of bioregional literature from the Utah desert wouldn’t be complete without Edward Abbey’s \"Desert Solitaire.\" Abbey is well known for his passion for the desert and his desire to keep it untrammeled and pristine. His thirst for a bare bones natural experience is evident as he shares stories from his time as a park ranger more than 50 years ago. The classic work is a celebration of the desert and an exploration of humanity’s connection with nature. Abbey is also known for \"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\" a fictional tale of ecosaboteurs near the Utah-Arizona border.\n\nTo examine a contrasting perspective, explore the work of Utah native Amy Irvine, who also spent time as a ranger in Arches National Park. \"Desert Cabal: A New Season in the Wilderness\" is her essay collection delving into Abbey’s writings about the desert and exploring them in a whole new light.\n\nPoetic Utah\n\nUtah’s first poet laureate, David Lee, explores the state’s poetic side through his huge collection of works. His talent and humor can be fully appreciated in his poetry collections such as \"News From Down to the Cafe,\" \"The Porcine Legacy\" and \"A Legacy of Shadows.\"\n\nFor a recent standout poetry compilation, \"Rain Scald\" by Utah native and Diné (Navajo) Tacey M. Atsitty delves into her reflections on life and Native American traditions. Atsitty has received numerous awards for her work, including the Truman Capote Creative Writing Fellowship Award, and leads the Native Village at This is The Place Park in Salt Lake City.\n\nField Guides Galore"
