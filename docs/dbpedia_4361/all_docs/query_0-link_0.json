Seitz who also starred with June Caprice, the film serial was an adventure film with locales as exotic as Tibet. The plot staple of an inventor of aviation technology having to contend with conspirators who wish to steal the invention, often appeared in aviation films.[N 1] The Sky Ranger is considered to be lost.[3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Rockwell (George B. Seitz) is young and adventurous. He meets June (June Caprice), a beautiful young girl on the road and decides she will be his wife. But Professor Elliott (Frank Redman), June's father, has him thrown out the door. George does not give up and saves the Professor from his cousin Murdock (Joe Cuny), who was trying to kill him. Professor Elliott has made a number of important inventions, including developing a fast, silent aircraft. His latest work concerns a new, powerful light, which is the object of those criminals who want to steal the invention.\n\nOn the day of their engagement, George and June are abducted on an aircraft which takes them to Tibet. Dr. Santro (Harry Semels), Murdock's accomplice, is the culprit. He and his wife Tharen (Peggy Shanor) leave the two in the hands of angry Tibetans. The two lovers are locked into a box with only a tiny hole in it through which they can see some food that is out of their reach. As if that was not enough suffering, one of the abductors decides to shoot them through the box.\n\nGeorge miraculously opens the box with a rock he had picked up before. As he tries to capture two horses, June is taken away in the desert by a Tibetan. George follows the traces left by his horse and rescues June in time.\n\nChapter titles\n\n[edit]\n\nOut of the Clouds\n\nThe Sinister Signal\n\nIn Hostile Hands\n\nDesert Law\n\nMid-Air\n\nThe Crystal Prism\n\nDanger's Doorway\n\nDropped from the Clouds\n\nThe House on the Roof\n\nTrapped\n\nThe Seething Pool\n\nThe Whirling Menace\n\nAt the Last Minute\n\nLiquid Fire\n\nThe Last Raid\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge B.

The Man Who Stole the Moon was compared to a similar film, A Message from Mars, a 1921 American silent fantasy comedy film released by Metro Pictures on April 11, 1921.[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of film serials\n\nList of film serials by studio\n\nList of lost films\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nFarmer, James H.
