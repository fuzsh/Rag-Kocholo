Dr. Bauer's personal goal is to ensure that research conducted under the auspices of the Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program is always held to the same high standards as all other research at Mayo Clinic. By ensuring this level of quality, the results that are achieved will positively contribute to knowledge that can inform clinical practice. The research of Dr. Bauer and the Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program has had many tangible impacts on patient care. For example, massage therapy is now routinely offered to postoperative patients, meditation training is being provided to more than 20,000 patients each year, and acupuncture is helping patients with migraine headaches. These are just a few examples of how Dr. Bauer and his colleagues have been able to translate research into direct changes in patient care. Research-informing practice remains a key focus for the Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program. You can find Dr. Bauer's clinical profile and research faculty profile at MayoClinic.org.\n\nAbout our guest: Christine Connors\n\nHaving sold more than 100,000 copies of their outdoor cooking books, Christine and her husband and co-author Tim Conners are experienced campers, backpackers, and outdoor chefs and the authors of The Scout’s Outdoor Cookbook, Lipsmackin’ Backpackin’, and Lipsmackin’ VegetarianBackpackin’. The Conners have twice served as judges for Scouting magazine’s prestigious national camp food cooking contest. Learn more at LipSmackinCampin.com.\n\nAbout our guest: Ryanne Crary\n\nA northern Arizona native, Ryanne grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Adventuring the high desert sparked her passion for the outdoors and all things wildlife. Her family's involvement with the Bureau of Land Management also inspired her to receive her degree in Parks and Recreation from ASU and a minor in Parks and Protected areas. During her stay in Phoenix, she spent her time as an animal handler at the Phoenix Zoo and attempted to escape the heat. Ryanne joined the Hike Shack in 2020 where she met her now husband Caleb, and future fur-son, Lance. She now works for The Town of Prescott Valley Parks and Recreation as a Recreation Supervisor and handles marketing and outreach for The Hike Shack. When she's not at work, you can find Ryanne exploring her home in Prescott, hiking, rock climbing, and picking up rocks and lizards with her husband, dogs Lance and Bingo, and her lizard Lizzie.\n\nAbout our guest: Louis Juers\n\nLouis Juers leads Arizona State Parks and Trails' program helping families discover the joy of camping: The Arizona Family Campout Program. With this program, Louis and his team of volunteers introduce families who are new to camping to the great experiences you can share in Arizona's outdoors. Ranger Louis is continuously applauded by families who participate with reviews like Jennifer S., who said, \"I am writing to rave about the AZ Family Campout that was held September 2023 at Slide Rock State Park. The warmth we felt from [ranger] Louis and his outstanding team of volunteers was immediate and sincere. Their energy and effort were unparalleled during the whole weekend, giving us families a chance to bond while building upon our camping know-how. Louis's background in education shone brightly all weekend. He anticipated our questions and provided outstanding lessons for each activity (e.x., setting up a tent, hiking, archery, geocaching/wayfinding, building a campfire, cooking at camp). We appreciated the detailed guidance Louis offered to help us succeed. And, thanks to his written materials sent prior to and after the experience, we're confident that we can excel in our next camping adventure. Our daughters, ages 6 and 9, did not want to leave on Sunday.
