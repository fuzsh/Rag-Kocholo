However, Disney’s original Pinocchio is easily one of the greatest animated films ever created. That’s even more impressive considering that it was made 82 years ago, during the infancy of the medium. Dick Jones provides the voice of Pinocchio, a puppet who is brought to life by the Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable) to be the son of a lonely toymaker, Geppetto (Christian Rub). Unfortunately, Pinocchio is a bit of a delinquent who has trouble telling right from wrong. That’s why Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) has to be Pinocchio’s conscience.

Kristen Bell, the voice of Anna, and Idina Menzel, who voices Elsa, are perfectly cast, as is Josh Gad as lovable oaf snowman Olaf.
