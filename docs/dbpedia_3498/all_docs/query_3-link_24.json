        "text": "How many movies with head in the title can you name? This list ranks the best movies with head in the name, whether they're documentaries, dramas, horror movies, or any other genre of film. Do you have a favorite movie with head in the title? Categorizing movies by words in their titles is kind of uncommon, but that's a big part of why this list is so fun to scroll through. There's probably one movie with head in the title you think of right away, but you might be shocked to see how many others exist as well.\n\nNotable films with head in the title include Head of State, Bullet in the Head, and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, although there are many more examples on this list. This poll is interactive, meaning you can vote the head movies up or down depending on how much you like them.\n\nBring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is a gritty, unapologetic exploration of human nature and its capacity for violence, where the titular \"head\" serves as both a grim, literal objective and a symbol of power and control. Directed by the legendary Sam Peckinpah, the film follows a bounty hunter seeking to collect a macabre reward, and in doing so, delves into themes of obsession, greed, and the consequences of our actions. The gruesome trophy, Alfredo Garcia's severed head, becomes a driving force behind the narrative, pushing characters to their limits and revealing their true colors. Ultimately, it offers an unflinching portrayal of humanity's darker side, elevating the simple notion of a \"head\" to a thematic device imbued with meaning and significance.\n\nReleased : 1974\n\nDirected by : Sam Peckinpah\n\n2\n\nThe Man Without a Head\n\nLaurent Casanova, Patrick BÃ©thune, Stephane Botti\n\nThe Man Without a Head is an enigmatic and thought-provoking film that utilizes the word \"head\" to represent both the protagonist's struggle to regain his lost sense of identity and the emotional turmoil that comes with such a journey. This French short film directed by Juan Solanas leads us through an imaginative world where the man must find his missing head, which serves metaphorically as a search for his sense of self and place in the world. The titular absence of a head brings forth existential questions, challenging viewers to ponder what it truly means to be incomplete - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. By masterfully weaving this symbol throughout its narrative, The Man Without a Head is more than just a creative visual experience; it's a profound exploration of the human condition.\n\nReleased : 2003\n\nDirected by : Juan Diego Solanas\n\nTony Leung Chiu Wai, Simon Yam, Jacky Cheung Hok-yau\n\nBullet in the Head, directed by prolific Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, is a riveting story of three friends whose lives spiral out of control after an ill-fated trip to war-torn Vietnam. In this case, \"head\" serves as a visceral, literal reference to the consequences of violence, while also symbolizing the psychological impact of war on the human psyche. The film deftly showcases the often horrifying aftermath of a \"bullet in the head,\" both physically and mentally, as it explores how wartime experiences can alter one's identity, friendships, and perceptions of right and wrong. Through its relentless, heart-pounding action and unflinching examination of the human condition under extreme circumstances, \"Bullet in the Head\" stands as a powerful cinematic testament to the harsh realities of violence and its lasting consequences.\n\nReleased : 1990\n\nDirected by : John Woo\n\nFrank Capra's A Hole in the Head, a lighthearted dramedy about an eccentric widower struggling to keep his life and family together, brilliantly utilizes the concept of a \"hole in the head\" as a means of exploring its central themes of responsibility, ambition, and self-discovery. As the protagonist, played by Frank Sinatra, attempts to juggle his dreams of building a Disneyland-style resort with his responsibilities as a father, the phrase \"a hole in the head\" becomes a recurring motif, highlighting the various \"holes\" - both metaphorical and emotional - that must be filled in order to achieve true happiness and success. By tackling these complex issues with humor and pathos, A Hole in the Head artfully demonstrates that the solutions to one's problems may not be as far-fetched as they initially appear.\n\nReleased : 1959\n\nDirected by : Frank Capra\n\nCharlton Heston, Yvette Mimieux, France Nuyen\n\nDiamond Head is a gripping drama set in the picturesque landscape of Hawaii, where the title itself refers to the iconic volcanic crater that overlooks Honolulu. However, the movie delves deeper into the symbolic meaning of Diamond Head as it unravels the intricate dynamics of power, tradition, and racial tensions between the native Hawaiians and the white elites. By using \"Head\" to represent the peak of power and influence within society, the film examines the lengths people are willing to go to maintain their status and control. Ultimately, Diamond Head showcases the duality of one's pursuit of power, both as a driving force for ambition and a harbinger of conflict and corruption.\n\nReleased : 1963\n\nDirected by : Guy Green\n\n6\n\nHead Trauma\n\nVince Mola, Jamil Mangan, Mary Monahan\n\nIn the psychological thriller Head Trauma, the title is both a literal and metaphorical representation of the protagonist's struggle with his past and present. The story follows a drifter who returns home after 20 years, only to be haunted by vivid nightmares stemming from a traumatic head injury. These manifestations of his \"head trauma\" force him to confront buried memories and guilt, culminating in a harrowing journey into the depths of his own psyche. The twisted, nightmarish visuals and chilling atmosphere of Head Trauma masterfully illustrate the notion that our minds can hold the key to our deepest fears and darkest secrets.\n\nReleased : 2006\n\nDirected by : Lance Weiler"
