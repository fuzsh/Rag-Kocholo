        "text": "Composer | Director | Producer | Screenwriter Born April 8, 1888 in Mahanoy City, PA\n\nMotion picture director Victor Schertzinger was credited with being the first artist to write a musical score for film.\n\nBorn in Pennsylvania, Schertzinger attended Brown University and the University of Brussels before playing with Sousa, Pryor and other famed musicians.\n\nHe got his start as a concert violinist and after European tours and a period leading the orchestra at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles, he wrote the musical score for \"Civilization,\" a Thomas Ince production. This fling in motion pictures led to his role as a director.\n\nAmong Schertzingerâs numerous hit pictures he directed over a period of years were \"One Night of Love\" (1934), \"Love Me Forever\" (1935), \"Something to Sing About\" (1937), \"The Mikado\" (1939), \"Road to Singapore\" (1940), \"Road to Zanzibar\" (1941), and many others. On others he collaborated both in the music field and on screenwriting.\n\nHe died suddenly at his Hollywood home on Oct. 26, 1941. His last film was the 1942 film \"The Fleetâs In,\" which featured the hit songs Schertzinger wrote with Johnny Mercer, \"Iâll Remember You\" and \"Tangerine.\""
