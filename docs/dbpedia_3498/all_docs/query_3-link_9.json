        "text": "I really struggled to stay interested in this 30's musical romance. It's tagged as a comedy but I'm really puzzled at to where the comedy was in the film. One thing is for sure - these Golden Age actors really put modern actors to shame at talents like tap-dancing. I wrote in my review of La La Land that those modern actors seemed to struggle at tap dancing compared to previous generations. Now, if only I cared at all for tap dancing or musicals in general I'd probably score this one higher, but I don't, so this one was completely sleep inducing for me even though I can admit that those involved were capable in their craft.\n\n1937 Ranked\n\n1930's Ranked\n\nComedies Ranked\n\nEarly Comedies Ranked\n\nMusicals Ranked\n\nEarly Musicals Ranked\n\nRomance films Ranked\n\nFilms about Productions Ranked\n\nGotta love the talented, inimitable, and charismatic James Cagney. He's wonderful, even though the plot is rather thin. Cagney plays the Hollywood star Terry Rooney. He falls in love with Rita (Evelyn Daw), but there's a clause in his contract that stipulates that he must remain single. Absurdity ensues as the Hollywood machine tries to cook up a romance between him and his co-star \"Steffie\" Hajos (Mona Barrie).\n\nIt's all rather innocent and dull and features some weird dubbing with the singing. There was one really poor moment with the sound (which can possibly be forgiven, because sound was still relatively new at the time). The writers spoon-feed the audience to the point where today's sophisticated viewers might find it…\n\nHere's the thing. If you have Jimmy Cagney, then you need to know what makes Cagney good. \"Something to Sing About\" has no idea what makes him good. The thing I find most compelling about Cagney is the sheer amount of energy he has. He's like a compacted ball of chaos, which is what makes him so damn fun. Unfortunately, \"Something to Sing About\" doesn't give him either of his good outlets for his energy (dancing or fighting) nearly enough. He has a couple of numbers and a fun fight scene, and frankly, those are two of the big standouts of the film. They're not the only standouts, I thought there were some good jokes, I thought it was interesting how the film played with expectations when it came to the character of Ito, and Evelyn Daw was solid enough. But in general, it completely misuses Cagney, making for an overall mediocre movie.\n\nWith the exception of his return Ragtime in 1981, James Cagney had retired by the time my movie-watching years began. I rarely saw him onscreen. He wasn't making new movies and his old ones weren't running on the few broadcast channels available back then. Even now his work is fairly hard to find on streaming services. Amazing for such a popular and prolific star.\n\nI hope the powers that decide these things will correct that. I need more Cagney. He is fast moving up my list of redoubtable actors–those I could watch in a good movie or a bad one, either way leaving with my favorable impression of them intact. Sophia Loren, Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks and a few others…\n\nCagney, big in the NY swing band club scene goes to Hollywood. He becomes a big hit, but then starts to struggle with his marriage.\n\nHas the ingredients for a better film, but the handling of the relationship, especially near the end, dings it. Philip Ahn got to play himself, and the general poking of the studio system has its charms. There are better Cagney films, and what make them better is the chemistry between him and the other actors.\n\nWhat price Hollywood? Happy-go-lucky stage hoofer Jimmy Cagney gets caught up in the movie studio system that wants to stifle his personality and wreck his marriage. Cagney made this film for a minor studio while he was trying to wrangle a better deal from Warners (the film's script is quite scathing of the techniques employed by the big boys) and unfortunately the film's rough production edges blunt the impact. It could have been written and directed with considerably more oomph than what's on display here.\n\nHowever we should be grateful to have another film that showcases the tap-dancing ebullience of Jimmy Cagney. What an incredible presence he was on screen, utterly at ease and totally mesmerising. He clearly adores displaying his twinkle-toed prowess and his routines here have you yearning for more. And that's something to sing about....\n\nSome time ago, a buddy recommended me a whole batch of Cagney movies that aren't old mobster films, so I figured that I gotta start somewhere.\n\nThis was a charming movie about movies, a subgenre that I always enjoy. Also, Cagney got a chance to show off his singing and dancing chops which was beyond impressive. However, the story itself, while interesting at first, managed to lost itself a bit, at least for me, as it went on. I still managed to enjoy it quite a bit, maybe I'm just a bit tired of musicals."
