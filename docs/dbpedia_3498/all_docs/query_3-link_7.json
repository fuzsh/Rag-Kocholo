        "text": "When a young European aristocrat and his mother enter the apartment of \"modern\" woman/successful painter/glamorous free spirit Cynthia Warren (Bebe Daniels), where a sparkling cocktail party is in full swing, he says to her, \"This is a Studio, mother!\"\n\nThat brought to mind the 1934 Cole Porter song Anything Goes: \"...when ev'ry night the set that's smart is indulging in nudist parties in studios...anything goes!\" Seems like the studios of bohemian artists had quite the reputation in that era!\n\nAnd it's that sort of jazz age, free love, glamorous international crowd kind of world that our story takes place in. Bebe Daniels and the whole cast are great and I enjoyed almost all of it, with the exception of the resolution that negates all that independent woman stuff.\n\nI liked the tough-mouthed Bebe Daniels at the start, but that all changed when she was taken for a fool by a married playboy and it all goes kind of soft and mushy. Randolph Scott doesn't get his moment to be the man that he is either, which was a bit of a let down. The romantic stuff was old fashioned and fine for this kind of film, but it wasn't the lovable movie it sometimes promised to be.\n\nThis is the best Bebe Daniels performance I've seen. When all of those men offer her cigarettes in the beginning of the film , it's clear she wields power.\n\nThe film has a plethora of scenes that mix the right amount of charm and hornyness. I really enjoyed it up until the end.\n\nIt's such a bummer for a wild and independent party girl to end up with her creepy ass stalker. It was a kick in the face to all of Bebe Daniels' character believed in for the majority of the film. To add insult to injury, her freewheeling gal pal was the one to push her into Randy's arms.\n\nRandy ! Leave her alone.\n\nIf you come to this movie for Randolph Scott, fair warning, he's only in the beginning and end, despite being second billed. But...!\n\nCocktail Hour also features copious amounts of drinking, hangovers, innuendos, and an act of defenestration that had me sitting up in my seat.\n\nBasically everything you'd want out of a Pre-Code movie.\n\nTCMFF 2022 #5\n\nEverything I could ever want in a movie! Bebe Daniels being a bossy and fabulous queen! Cruise ship shenanigans! An insane final act twist! This was my most anticipated new watch of the festival and will be hard to top.\n\nThis 4k restoration of COCKTAIL HOUR, such a hard movie to track down otherwise, is also so beautiful! Crisp! Production photos are slipped in for a scene that was cut but for which they had the audio (when you hear it you can kinda tell why the censors had a problem, lol). Fingers crossed for a blu-ray release!"
