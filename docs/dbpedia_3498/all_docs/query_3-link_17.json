        "text": "In this second entry in the Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour Road series, Chuck (Crosby) and Fearless (Hope) are really in hot waterâ€”as guests of honor at a cannibal feast while stranded in the heart of Africa. American sideshow performers Chuck and Fearless are stranded in the jungle after their human cannonball act starts a fire that burns down the circus. They become entangled with a larcenous pair of entertainers from Brooklyn (Lamour and Una Merkel) anxious to separate them from their bankroll. Duped into accompanying the ladies on a safari, Chuck and Fearless soon find themselves in the clutches of savage tribesmen who pit Fearless against a gorilla in a wild wrestling match. A blend of jokes, zany adventures and songs, Road to Zanzibar became one of the top-grossing films of 1941. Directed by Victor Schertzinger, who also directed the first film in the series, Road to Singapore.\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
