        "text": "Tune in to First Take with Lando and Chavis – weekdays from 6-9 am MT – for Stories of Standards to hear our favorite versions of this song all week long!\n\nVictor Schertzinger composed “Tangerine” (1942) for the film “The Fleet’s In”, which he also directed, produced, wrote the screenplay, conducted and was violinist. He also composed the film’s other hit song “I Remember You”. Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics for both songs. Dorothy Lamour and William Holden starred, while Betty Hutton made her film debut. The Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, with Bob Eberly and Helen O’Connell as vocalists, featured prominently. This recording lasted 15 weeks on the charts and peaked at #1, with slightly different lyrics than in the movie. At least 89 recordings have been made, ranging from Stan Getz’ 1956 recording to Marian McPartland’s 1991 recording at her 85th birthday party. Johnny Mercer was quoted as saying “I don’t know why I called it ‘Tangerine’, except that it had a kind of Latin flavor, the melody.”\n\nVictor Schertzinger (1890-1941) was a prodigy who played violin with professional orchestras by the time he was eight years old. He wrote scores for silent films, then went on to directing actors such as Richard Dix and Mabel Normand. “The Love Parade” in 1929, starring Maurice Chevalier and introducing Jeannette MacDonald, marked his entry into talkies. His 1934 movie “One Night of Love” garnered the first Oscar for Best Score. He then went back to composing and “The Fleet’s In” was his last movie, its release occurring after a heart attack led to his unexpected death in 1941. He had directed 89 films, composed scores for 50 films and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was especially noted for his ability to get along with everyone.\n\nJohnny Mercer (1909-1976), while best known as the lyricist of more than 1500 songs, also sang (with 13 Top 10 hits), composed songs for 100 motion pictures, wrote 23 theatrical productions (including “St. Louis Woman” and “Li’l Abner”), founded Capitol Records, co-founded Cowboy Records, co-founded the Songwriters Hall of Fame. His widow created the Johnny Mercer Foundation to “support the discipline of songwriting in the tradition of the Great American Songbook as exemplified by the life and work of Johnny Mercer.”"
