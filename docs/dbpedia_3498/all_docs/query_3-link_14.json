At bedtime, the partners steal Steve's clothes to prevent him from sneaking out, but he steals a dressing gown from Linda, who has been placed in the cabin next to his in hopes they will \"reunite.\" Steve sneaks into Gwen's room at her invitation and, having fallen in love with her, assures her that he is not married. The next day, everyone is mad at Steve: Gwen, because she finds out he was in Linda's room the previous night; the mothers, because he was in Linda's room and is not really married to her; and Van, because he is jealous. To make matters worse, Linda, who has engineered a ruse with Dick, vows that Steve is her errant husband and father of her child. Just before 4:00 p.m., Mr. Bishop, head of a charity organization for which Gwen raised the $10,000, demands to see the money. Gwen, who overhears the partners discussing how they plan to trick Steve into losing, stalls for time to help him. Steve confidently lies about how he has invested the money when the clock strikes four. The partners think they have won the bet because they set the clocks ahead, but Steve's assistant Samuel had corrected the clocks. Steve's victory means that he has doubled Gwen's money, and he tells everyone that he had made a bet for which he was supposed to lie for twenty-four hours, thereby reinstating his honor and earning him a kiss from Gwen.\n\nLess"
