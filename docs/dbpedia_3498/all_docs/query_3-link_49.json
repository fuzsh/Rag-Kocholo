        "text": "Rhythm on the River\n\n1940, 92 min., b&w\n\nRathbone plays Oliver Courtney, a successful composer. But for some time he has not been able to find the inspiration to write either music or lyrics. To keep up his public image of success, Courtney hires two ghost writers: Bob Sommers (Bing Crosby) to write the tunes and Cherry Lane (Mary Martin) to write the lyrics. Neither Bob nor Cherry realize that they both work for Courtney.\n\nOscar Levant, a musician known for his wit on the radio show Information Please, plays Billy Starbuck, assistant to Oliver Courtney. He displays his witty personality in this film as well. According to Hollywood magazine, \"Oscar began acting his role in the picture by reading from the script, but soon dropped that to improvise his own speeches. Many of his lines in the film were thought up by him on the spur of the moment. He also originated some of the comic scenes.\"1 Here is one comic scene, in which Courtney tries to explain why he can no longer write:\n\nCourtney: It's no use. I haven't been able to write a good song of my own since \"Good-bye to Love.\" And a good song must come from the heart. Starbuck: Not with your ears. Courtney: My heart just stopped singing when she died. Starbuck: She didn't die. She got fat. Courtney: What? Starbuck: Why try that sentimental drool on me? You know as well as I do she married a guy from Naples who ran a one-armed spaghetti joint. Courtney: I prefer to think of her as dead. There will never be another like her. Starbuck: Baloney. There's one born every minute.\n\nFollowing a series of humorous encounters, Bob and Cherry discover the truth that Oliver Courtney hasn't written anything in years. Bob and Cherry are the ones responsible for Courtney's hits.\n\nBob and Cherry then form their own songwriting team, leaving Courtney to himself. But publishers won't buy their songs because they sound just like Courtney's! They think Cherry and Bob are half-baked imitators.\n\nOliver Courtney finds that he cannot get along without Bob and Cherry, so he finally agrees to give them full credit for the songs. At a club, Courtney announces that the three of them will be collaborating on songs for a Broadway show.\n\nMary Martin, Bing Crosby, Basil Rathbone\n\nBasil Rathbone and Oscar Levant\n\nThe story has nothing to do with a river, but the title Rhythm on the River is an improvement on the working title, which was Ghost Music. This entertaining musical comedy is punctuated with seven songs. One of them, \"I Don't Want to Cry Anymore,\" was written by the director, Victor Schertzinger (and sung by Mary Martin). The other six songs were written by Johnny Burke and James Monaco:\n\n\"That's For Me\" (sung by Martin)\n\n\"Ain't It a Shame About Mame\" (sung by Martin)\n\n\"What Would Shakespeare Have Said?\" (sung by Crosby)\n\n\"Rhythm on the River\" (sung by Crosby)\n\n\"Only Forever\" (sung by Martin and Crosby together)\n\n\"When the Moon Comes Over Madison Square\" (sung by Crosby)\n\nMary Martin and Bing Crosby are wonderful singers, of course, and they do a great job with the songs. Especially noteworthy is the pawn shop jam session featuring Wingy Manone on the trumpet and Bing Crosby playing the drums. Rathbone is delightful in his comedic role.\n\nInteresting bits of trivia include the following:\n\nJohn Scott Trotter, who plays himself in the film, was the orchestra leader on Bing Crosby's radio show.\n\nA few days before shooting started, Mary Martin had eloped with Paramount story editor Richard Halliday.\n\nParamount hired Ouida Rathbone as technical advisor for the party sequences.2\n\nRathbone dancing\n\nRathbone stares at the portrait of the woman who left him.\n\nFollowing the August 1940 premier of the film, reviews were very favorable:\n\n\"Paramount will certainly please Bing's fans with Rhythm on the River.\" Louella Parsons, Los Angeles Examiner\n\nOne of the best of the films with which Crosby ever has been identified. The tunes and the way they are done will go far to capture audiences.\" Edwin Schallert, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Rhythm on the River hits high note in Crosby shows. A most tuneful and tasty piece of Crosby musical entertainment.\" Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Bing Crosby goes to town for a hit in Rhythm on the River. A choice piece of entertainment. One of the most entertaining and best quality films the studio has delivered in many months.\" Daily Variety\n\n\"A gay, tuneful and thoroughly entertaining picture, smartly acted and filled with melodies that ought to appeal to the public ear for a long time.\" Boston Globe\n\n\"Rhythm on the River refreshing entertainment. Winning, romantic comedy.\" Los Angeles Daily\n\n\"It is a light offering, a gay and tuneful kidding of the song-writing and song-publishing profession.\" Motion Picture Daily, 20 Aug 1940\n\n\"A swell piece of box-office fare . . . a revel in song and comedy, remarkably clever in every respect.\" Showmen's Trade Review\n\n\"Creaky but cheery musical with a quite charming romance.\" United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\n\nMary Martin and Basil Rathbone\n\nOscar Levant and Basil Rathbone\n\n\"Bing Crosby's new one is one of the most tuneful pictures he's made ... an hour and a half of highly agreeable entertainment.\" Helen Eager, Boston Traveler\n\n\"Rhythm on the River has already proved in key cities from coast to coast that a big Bing picture with a Paramount all star cast and a bunch of Paramount hit parade tunes is just right to open the season with a bang.\" Motion Picture Herald\n\n\"A comedy with music that has everything, plus a swell story that presents Bing Crosby and Mary Martin as a pair of song-writers who \"ghost\" for Basil Rathbone until they strike out on their own to find success. Top-notch songs and Oscar Levant's own special brand of comedy.\" Photoplay\n\n\"One of the most likeable musical pictures of the season.\" Bosley Crowther, The New York Times\n\n.\n\nHere's Mary Martin singing \"That's For Me\" to Basil Rathbone. Oscar Levant is playing the piano.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBasil Rathbone and Lillian Cornell\n\nBasil Rathbone\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMore pictures from Rhythm on the River are on Page Two and Page Three.\n\n.\n\nImages on this page and pages 2 and 3 are from the film \"Rhythm on the River,\" copyright Paramount Pictures.\n\nNotes"
