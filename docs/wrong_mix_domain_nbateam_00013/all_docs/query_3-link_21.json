        "text": "Former Warriors guard Monta Ellis is attempting an NBA comeback.\n\nEllis, now 35 years old, has been out of the league for over four years, having most recently appeared in 74 games for the Indiana Pacers during the 2016-17 season. The 12-year NBA veteran recently told Empire Sports Media that he wants another shot.\n\n\"I believe I still have a lot in my tank,\" Ellis said on a Zoom call. \"I can still play five years.\"\n\nOriginally drafted straight out of high school by the Warriors with the No. 40 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, Ellis quickly became a fan favorite in Golden State. He was named the NBA's Most Improved Player in 2007 and was a critical member of the \"We Believe\" Warriors. He was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Andrew Bogut during the 2012-13 season, which opened the door for Steph Curry to grow into the superstar he has become today.\n\nRELATED: Steph reveals details on Iguodala's mentality for next season\n\nEllis holds career averages of 17.8 points and 4.6 assists per game on 45.1 percent shooting from the field and 31.4 percent from 3-point range. He told Empire that he has resolved the off-court struggles that were partly responsible for his NBA exit, and that he just wants an opportunity to show what he can do.\n\n\"My main thing is, just bring me in and give me a look,\" Ellis said. \"Like you could make the decision on me. I just want a shot. I ain’t asking for a contract to get $5 million, $10 million, or even $1 million. All I’m asking is give me a look. That’s all and let my game speak for itself. I just want an opportunity, a workout, and that’s not the end of the world, that’s not gonna hurt anybody.\"\n\nGolden State Warriors"
