        "text": "It’s been four years since Monta Ellis stepped on an NBA court.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers still owe him $2.25 million this coming season, the last of the stretch provision they applied when they waived him and his $11.2 million salary in 2017.\n\n“I believe I still have a lot in my tank. I can still play five years,” Ellis told Empire Sports Media on a zoom call.\n\nEllis was under the heat in a soccer field somewhere in Dallas, Texas, the entire zoom call. He was at the sidelines cheering for his kid in a soccer game last weekend.\n\nNot long ago, his weekend schedule is focused on him — either practicing with his team or playing in an NBA city.\n\nThese days, it’s no longer about himself. Away from the spotlight and the dizzying NBA lifestyle, Ellis has grown as a man, a husband, a father, and a coach. But deep inside, he still yearns to be in the middle of the action watching how the NBA spacing could cater to his uptempo game.\n\nAt his prime, Ellis was a wrecking ball who blitzed his opponents with blazing speed and athleticism. A former McDonald’s All-American, he entered the NBA straight from high school as the 40th pick in 2005. He spent his first six and a half years with the Golden State Warriors improving each year. Soon after, the 2007 Most Improved Player became their franchise player. He was until he got traded to the Milwaukee Bucks at the trade deadline in the 2012-13 season to make way for rising shooting star Stephen Curry.\n\nThat broke his heart, and he lost himself in the process.\n\nEllis still led the Bucks to a playoff appearance — his first since 2007 — but got swept in the first round. He went to Dallas, where he found a home and became the first player other than Dirk Nowitzki to lead the team in scoring during his time there. He was instrumental in the Mavericks’ two playoff runs, averaging 26.0 points in a first-round loss to James Harden and the Houston Rockets in 2015. But ultimately, Ellis left the Mavericks for financial security after not picking up his $8.7 million player option.\n\nLarry Bird and Frank Vogel convinced Ellis to sign a four-year, $44 million contract despite Sacramento Kings offering four million more. The Pacers sold him the vision of becoming Paul George’s running mate.\n\nâ€œFor him to get one last really big deal, to me, was a no-brainer,â€ Dirk Nowitzki said when he left. â€œI wouldâ€™ve liked to kept him [in Dallas], but you know how it is in this league. Once people hit free agency, itâ€™s tough to call.â€\n\nIt proved to be Ellis’ undoing as his career started to go downhill. And when the Pacers traded away George and started a rebuild, the writings were on the wall.\n\nEllis tried to work out a buyout with Pacers. But when they couldn’t agree, the Pacers waived him.\n\n“The 2017 Monta Ellis had a lot of things going on mentally that started to affect me physically. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons why I walked away from the game. It wasnâ€™t that I couldnâ€™t play the game anymore,” Ellis told Empire Sports Media.\n\n“Itâ€™s just felt like that my mental health was way more important. I felt like my family and kids needed me more. Thereâ€™s a lot of things that affected me off the court. I havenâ€™t had a father in my life and I have to balance fatherhood with my NBA professional life. It was challenging.”\n\nEllis took care of his battle off the court because he felt that held him back on the court.\n\n“So, my family was the most important to me. I had to get my household, my family in order and get my mind back. So once my mind got back, I started lifting and running and my body started to feel good. I was able to release that mental pressure and really get back and re-focused,” Ellis said.\n\n“So, the 2017 Monta Ellis, he was balancing a lot of things. I didnâ€™t feel like it was healthy for me and for the team as well. If they couldnâ€™t get into the Monta Ellis flow, I had to get away from it. I did that and it was a good decision because Iâ€™m in a better mindset. My wife and kids, they were happy to get to see me more, be around more. That was the blessing.”\n\nIt was indeed a blessing. But it was also a curse.\n\nWhen Ellis felt he’s ready for an NBA comeback, the league has moved on from him.\n\nBut he’s not yet losing hope. Ellis is determined to find his way back to the NBA as he did with his life.\n\nThese days, he keeps himself in shape by working out four days a week, coaching his kids and other kids in his AAU program, Ellis Elite. He still trains with an NBA trainer while waiting for the right opportunity.\n\n“We’ve been training four days a week. We take Fridays off. He works out in Michael Johnson Performance â€“ the top athleteâ€™s performance institution here in Dallas. So he does that two-hour workout every Monday, Wednesday Friday, the whole four years he was out of the league. You could check Michael Johnsonâ€™s record,” long-time NBA trainer Djamel Jackson told Empire Sports Media.\n\nJackson, who has trained Mo Williams, Julius Randle, Draymond Green, Jeremy Lin, Emmanuel Mudiay, Isiah Austin, Rashad Butler, Terrance Ferguson, Malik Newman, saw up close how Ellis had grown a lot as a person during his NBA hiatus.\n\n“I have been working with kids all my life. Thereâ€™s certain patience that you develop, you become compassionate. Once you get a little older, some of the things that you love or you walked away from, you kinda appreciate a little bit more. He got young kids. He got young sons that are really good basketball players. Being able to watch their pops in the league a couple of more years will help lift them up. He definitely has grown as a friend, as a father, as a player. Once you get a little older, you kinda get to mature,” Jackson said.\n\nDerrius Nelson, a FIBA-certified agent and an NBA scout from Serbia-based DaggerBasket Agency, is now Ellis current business manager. They have spent many nights talking about what-ifs and mapping out a way back to the league. Nelson got Ellis a $2 million offer to play in China, but Ellis turned it down because he wanted to be with his family during the pandemic and stay closer to the NBA.\n\nEllis acknowledged the mistakes of his youth, and he had made amends. He’s been working hard for that elusive second chance.\n\n“Iâ€™ve been trying for a couple of years. I just got nobody take a chance on me, bringing me for the training camp to show what I can still do. The way how I walked away from it kind of hinder that a little bit because they didnâ€™t know the mindset I was in, the things that were going on,” Ellis said. “But it is what it is. If I have an opportunity to do it, it is what it is. If I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll still be a husband and a father and I have an AAU program. Iâ€™m good either way. But to come back, to be able challenge myself and do the thing that I havenâ€™t done in a while, that will be a big challenge that I am willing to accept if it comes.”\n\nWhile the NBA is getting younger, the league’s older guys and Ellis’ contemporaries are still killing it and milking money. Kyle Lowry, 35, just signed a new $90 million deal with the Miami Heat. The Phoenix Suns locked up Chris Paul, 36, to a whopping four-year, $120 million. And then there are minimum veterans like Carmelo Anthony, now set to chase a ring with his old buddy LeBron James.\n\nEllis wants to come back for the challenge, not the money, at this point in his life. After all, he’s earned more than $100 million throughout his career.\n\n“I donâ€™t play the game of basketball for the money. Like, itâ€™s good to get the money. I wanted to make a better life for my family and the NBA allowed me to do that. My focus is, my thing is just do what I can do, control what I can control and put everything in Godâ€™s hands,” Ellis said.\n\nAll Ellis wanted is an opportunity to show that he still has it and can help a team win.\n\n“My main thing is, just bring me in and give me a look. Like you could make the decision on me. I just want a shot. I ainâ€™t asking for a contract to get $5 million, $10 million, or even $1 million. All Iâ€™m asking is give me a look. Thatâ€™s all and let my game speak for itself. I just want an opportunity, a workout, and thatâ€™s not the end of the world, thatâ€™s not gonna hurt anybody,” Ellis said.\n\nEllis built a reputation as a shotmaker and playmaker. Though he was knocked for his defense, the numbers and some eye tests suggest otherwise.\n\nEllis knows his days as a go-to guy are over. He’s willing to accept whatever role a team has for him to win.\n\n“Thatâ€™s a team decision if that was to happen. Whatever role that was. Whatever the coach asks me to do. I canâ€™t control that situation. Being at the age that I am, I havenâ€™t played in a while so being the time I was away from the game, I canâ€™t come in and play the role that I want. Itâ€™s all about the team giving me an opportunity and whatâ€™s the best fit for them. And I gotta play that role the best way possible,” Ellis said.\n\nEllis played with pace in the NBA. But there wasn’t so much space during his prime. While his athleticism has started to fade with age, his wisdom grew with experience.\n\n“Itâ€™s still basketball. Itâ€™s all about defending and putting the ball on the hoop and making plays for others,” Ellis said. “The NBA is very, very young now. So, itâ€™s more athletic, faster, and I have always played a fast game.”\n\nEllis was just a 31 percent three-point shooter throughout his career, but he will not be jacking up shots as he used to be. His ideal role in a potential NBA return is to break down the second unit’s defenses to score or make plays for his teammates in sporadic minutes. But Jackson revealed how Ellis has worked on his shot not just to prepare for a potential NBA comeback.\n\n“Thatâ€™s the one that has definitely gotten better. As he aged, heâ€™s gotten better. And heâ€™s working with kids. So, when youâ€™re teaching kids how to shoot, it matters that you learn how to shoot better. It could go around the low 40s, and you know, with the spacing, the new rules, and his knowledge of the game, as you get older, you get better,” Jackson said.\n\n“The NBA tells us, the system tells us that as you get older, you get better and smarter because you know how to beat younger guys.”\n\nJackson believes playoff teams could use someone like Ellis on their bench to provide leadership and scoring.\n\n“Any team right now — the league is now so young — the (Los Angeles) Lakers or Brooklyn (Nets) but aside from those teams, every team needs some veteran help. Every team I think needs at least 4-5 veterans. The league is just too young right now,” Jackson said.\n\nThe Lakers have been stacking up on veterans. The Nets could pair him with Patty Mills in their backcourt off the bench. A Mavericks homecoming could also be a perfect marriage with him as another shotmaker and playmaker to come off the bench when Luka Doncic takes a breather. The Portland Trail Blazers, who are at a crossroads with Damian Lillard’s future hanging in the balance, could use Ellis as a scoring punch and a veteran leader off the bench.\n\n“That would be a role that I am willing to accept. I could do a lot within that role to help a playoff team. I still got a lot of gas in my tank. My body is healthy. My mind is focused. I could definitely help a playoff team with the skills and the knowledge of the game I have right now,” Ellis said.\n\nIt’s been four years since Ellis last played an NBA game. A lot has happened since. But the most important thing is he found himself again and the joy of playing basketball. He found his way back to his life. Now, he wants to find a way back to the NBA."
