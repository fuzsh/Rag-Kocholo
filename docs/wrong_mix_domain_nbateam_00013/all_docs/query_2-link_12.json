        "text": "Malik Monk cites Monta Ellis as his biggest inspiration as a kid\n\nDuring an interview with NBC Sports California’s Morgan Ragan on “Kings Central,” Malik Monk revealed who inspired his love for basketball. “A few people, my brother, for one. I still look up to him today,” Monk told Ragan. “Then Monta Ellis, I like Monta Ellis a lot. Baron Davis. He’s just like a shifty guard that has bounce. [Russell] Westbrook for sure. But when I was six, seven, eight, it was Monta Ellis for sure. How exciting he is. I think I do some of the same things. he can dribble, shoot, [he’s] fearless.”\n\nThis past Saturday, the Warriors welcomed dynamic guard Monta Ellis back to the Bay as he was a guest at the game against the Brooklyn Nets at Chase Center. Ellis was the 40th overall pick of the 2005 NBA Draft, won the league’s Most Improved Player award in 2006-07 and averaged 19.6 points per game in 6.5 seasons with the Warriors.\n\nEllis reflected on his time in the Bay on the Golden State Warriors Podcast and shared that Dub Nation significantly contributed to the ‘We Believe’ playoff upset. “You could just feel the energy as soon as you walk out the tunnel,” Ellis shared. “I’ve never seen fans stand the entire game like they did that night. You could feel it like it was an earthquake. They [Dub Nation] helped us win that series.”\n\n“I would say European was Toni Kukoc,” Mamukelashvili revealed his European role model. “I loved his game. He was the first big who could pass, dribble, and shoot. Lefty. I definitely loved watching him. “My American ones were Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, and Monta Ellis,” the New-York born big man said. “Those were the guys I used to always mimic as a young kid. But yeah, Toni Kukoc was my European guy, who I was trying to play like. That’s the style [European with an American swag] how I wanna play, and hopefully, it looks like that.”\n\nYou’re obviously pretty bullish on Jalen’s development, and I know player comps can be a bad idea, but does he remind you of anybody? Stephen Silas: It’s funny because he kind of reminds you of Monta (Ellis, with whom Silas was close during his Warriors days). He can get to his midrange, and he can score that way. He’s super, super athletic. He’s fast with his first step. He’s bigger than Monta. And obviously when Monta was doing his thing, he wasn’t the 3-point shooter that Jalen is. But as far as doing it in an easy way and going fast and being hard to guard and averaging 20-plus (points) on a nightly basis, that’s (like Monta). … Jalen has All-Star potential, so I don’t want to diminish that by comparing him to Monta. But they just remind me of each other with how easy it was — like, 20 was easy for him. And it’s the same way for Jalen.\n\nChandler Parsons: I was on my rookie deal and I was a restricted free agent. So this was actually when we brought Dwight and we did the deal. Basically Mark Cuban came in and he gave me a crazy max deal with a no-trade clause, a player option in the last year… As a restricted free agent, you kind of have to do that to get the team not to match. At the time I loved playing with James Harden, I loved playing with Kevin McHale and Dwight and I just thought you know what? Dallas… Dirk Nowitzki is my favorite player of all time. They got Monta Ellis. Everyone who plays with Rick Carlisle with this crazy offense, pick and roll, threes… as a shooter I couldn’t think of a better offense and I accepted the offer and Houston didn’t match. It was awesome. I love Dallas.\n\nStoryline: Chandler Parsons Free Agency"
