        "text": "TORONTO – Monta Ellis scored 15 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, Tyson Chandler had 11 points and 10 rebounds and the Dallas Mavericks won for the eighth time in 10 games, beating the Toronto Raptors 106-102 on Friday night\n\nChandler Parsons scored 16 points, Dirk Nowitzki had 15 Al-Farouq Aminu 14 as the Mavericks snapped Toronto’s winning streak at six games.\n\nMavericks coach Rick Carlisle won his 300th game with Dallas. He’s the third coach in team history to reach the mark, joining Don Nelson (339) and Dick Motta (329).\n\nKyle Lowry scored 25 points, Amir Johnson had 20 and Lou Williams 16 for the Raptors, who saw All-Star DeMar DeRozan leave in the third with a strained left groin.\n\nPatrick Patterson had 10 points and 12 rebounds as the Raptors dropped to 9-2 at home. Toronto’s only other home defeat this season was a 100-93 loss to Chicago on Nov. 13.\n\nDevin Harris made a pair of free throws with 7:22 left to give Dallas an 84-73 lead, but back-to-back 3-pointers by Johnson and Greivis Vasquez cut it to 84-79.\n\nParsons hit a jump shot and Harris made one of two at the line, but Lowry answered with two free throws and Johnson made a layup, making it 87-83 with 5:10 left.\n\nAfter a Dallas timeout, Ellis scored consecutive baskets on either side of a turnover by Lowry, then added a 3 at 3:27 to give the Mavericks a 94-83 lead.\n\nToronto refused to go quietly, however. Vasquez made back-to-back 3s, Lowry followed a pair of Nowitzki free throws with another 3, then made a layup with 33 seconds left, bringing the Raptors to within three at 99-96.\n\nEllis made one of two free throws with 15 seconds left, giving Dallas a four-point lead, but a jumper by Lowry cut the gap to two, 104-102. Harris was fouled and made both, and Lowry’s final 3-point shot missed.\n\nDeRozan slipped and fell on a drive to the basket at 8:23 of the third. He remained down on the court for several minutes, kicking his leg in pain as his concerned teammates gathered around him. Eventually, DeRozan stood up and walked gingerly to the locker room. Minutes later, the Raptors announced that DeRozan had suffered a strained left groin and would not return.\n\nDeRozan finished scoreless for the first time this season, missing all eight shots from the field in 21 minutes."
