        "text": "Getty Images\n\nAfter a successful two-year stint with the Dallas Mavericks, Monta Ellis is reportedly headed to the Indiana Pacers on a four-year deal.\n\nThe Pacers beat out the Kings, Hawks, Knicks and Heat, who were all linked to Ellis prior to the signing.\n\nESPN's Chris Broussard reported the Pacers and Ellis have agreed to a four-year contract. ESPN's Marc Stein confirmed the signing and reported the deal is worth $44 million, with an option in the final year of the deal.\n\nIt appears as though Ellis may not be done moving this offseason though, as Adrian Wojnarowksi of Yahoo Sports indicated a trade involving the Dallas Mavericks could be in play:\n\nWojnarowski previously reported the Kings sent Jason Thompson, Nik Stauskas and Carl Landry to the 76ers in an effort to clear cap space for free agent Ellis. Broussard indicated the Kings offered $48 million over four years, but Ellis elected to take less money to sign with Indiana.\n\nBroussard reported the Atlanta Hawks and New York Knicks expressed interest in the guard as well. Shams Charania of RealGM.com added the Miami Heat to his list of potential suitors prior to his decision to head to Indiana.\n\nEllis is an ideal fit with the Pacers, where they're in need of a legitimate scorer alongside star Paul George. He'll bring an energy to the court, and help to stretch things out on the offensive end, although it remains to be seen how he'll fit with the Pacers' stifling defense."
