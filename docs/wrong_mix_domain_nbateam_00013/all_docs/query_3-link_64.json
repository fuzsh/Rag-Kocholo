        "text": "Monta Ellis has been out of the NBA for more than four years, but the 36-year-old guard thinks he has enough left in the tank for another go-round and hopes his former team can help make it happen.\n\nThe former Golden State Warriors guard opened up this week about his desire to return to the NBA, saying in an interview on 95.7 The Game’s “Steiny & Guru” show that he has been staying in shape and would be open to the idea of coming back to play one final season and retire with the Warriors.\n\nThe latest Warriors news straight to your inbox!

The former Warriors guard pushed back, saying he might only have once chance to play again and wants to keep his focus on returning to the NBA. Ellis last played with the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the 2017 playoffs.\n\n“I’d rather get that chance, if that opportunity and something happens and presents itself, then I can live with that, versus trying to go the other route,” Ellis said. “Like I said, if it don’t happen, it don’t happen.”\n\nIf there’s a chance he does make an NBA comeback, Ellis said he’d like it to be in Golden State and even joked that Warriors owner Joe Lacob should sign him right now.\n\n“I love the Bay Area,” Ellis said. “I know they love me, too. Y’all go in there and tell Joe Lacob, man, go and get me a contract or something, man. I wanna retire as a Warriors. I can go out there and give ‘em 10-15 buckets.”\n\nEllis started his NBA career with the Warriors in the 2005-06 season, playing there for six seasons. His best season in the Bay came in 2009-10, when he averaged 25.5 points per game. Ellis and young guard Steph Curry made for a small but dangerous backcourt duo, but the Warriors opted to trade Ellis for big man Andrew Bogut in 2012.\n\nEllis said he was upset at Lacob at the time — especially since he had gotten assurances that he would not be traded — but sees the value of the trade in retrospect.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s something that happened unfortunately, but at the end of the day, we go back and look at it now, he didn’t make a bad move,” Ellis said. “It wasn’t so bad. They got over it really quick. It was a good, funny moment.”\n\nMaking the Case for Ellis"
