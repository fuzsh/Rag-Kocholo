        "text": "When I still lived in the apocalyptic glint of the Bay Area, when the Warriors were still basically one of the three biggest jokes in the league, I looked to my dad for wisdom and clarity in all matters related to our favorite basketball team. Dinner and a basketball game, just the two of us. Who knows where my brother or my mom were? They didn’t care, didn’t understand Anthony Randolph or Monta Ellis (another friend of yours in Dallas). Dad had come up in a different world, whereas I found myself hamstrung by the present, refreshing Golden State of Mind, Warriorsworld.com, Tim Kawakami columns, or any number of other contemporary but ephemeral musings on the state of the state. Dad was old school, inured to the generational agony of this particular fandom but also someone who remembered the victory of 1975 vividly—remembered it as a Tolkien-esque victory of good over evil in his own personal mythology, remembered the possibility of another way. His perspective of this history was welcome as an antidote to the hot takes, the noise, the doldrums of now.\n\nAll this to say: when my dad said the Warriors would be crazy not to draft “that kid from Washington State,” I took that to heart. To be fair, my dad has a fondness for historically good shooters. He said much the same thing about Steph Curry, “that kid from Davidson,” a few years earlier. Why Jimmer Fredette didn’t meet his approval I don’t know and don’t care. But even as the Warriors turned their gaze toward the likes of Bismack Biyombo and Jan Veselý, it was always Klay Thompson or bust for us. And so it was for the Warriors, and the rest is controversial, Tolkien-esque history.\n\nI have written so many words about Klay Thompson in the last dozen or so years, so forgive me for not knowing where to start or where to end. He’s always a person who invites a vast amount of writing, because not only is he one of my favorite players of all time, but he’s a dang character, and not in a contrived or affected way. He’s a genuinely relatable and goofy soul—or he was, before 2019. You know that, but now you’ll see it up close: in terse training camp footage, in exasperated post-game pressers, in muted but joyous Instagram posts. Dallas, it is my sincere hope that he regains his old weapons and maybe tilts a playoff game or two for you, happily ensconced in a new system and a pecking order of options that makes sense instead of the confusion of the late-era Golden State depth chart that boiled down to 1) Steph Curry and 2) Everyone Else Do Their Best.\n\nKlay Thompson is Prometheus, a Titan who stole fire from heaven, but instead of bestowing it upon mankind, he decided to light a big fat spliff and buy a boat. See? That’s the type of thing you can type out with human fingers, and, sure, it’s not strictly accurate due to it being gibberish, but it’s also completely true. Klay, when you get to know him—and I wish, Dallas, that you could have known him the way we knew him—transcends language, transcends art. Zigs when you expect him to zag, spins against the way he drives. A stoic who simultaneously is a maelstrom, a cataloger of slights and offenses (see: Jaren Jackson Jr.). The chillest guy you could ever meet and the angriest man you ever knew. (He is also the only NBA player to ever go on record and describe Paul Pierce as doughy, which makes him a first-ballot Hall of Famer in my book.)\n\nYou’re lucky to have him—even in 2024, even if he winds up disappointing you. I tell you that as an aggrieved party who wishes the end of this particular era didn’t come crashing down so abruptly, so weirdly. That’s OK. I’m not crying. It’s fine. He’s yours now.\n\nKlay is like a shark in that he never stops moving. (This may actually be untrue of sharks, but that doesn’t matter. Shark Week is almost over.) The man was born coming off screens and scurrying across the court in chaotically methodical routes, finding inches of daylight to launch from the corner with a three-point stroke that’s gorgeous in its proletariat simplicity. Look, both Splash Brothers can shoot that orange ball of love better than essentially every human ever born, but their mechanics are spiritually and physically estranged. Where Steph Curry’s shots feel like an almost laughable divine judgment, Klay’s are more like a dispassionate artillery bombardment. At any moment, after quarters of silence, Klay Thompson can quietly come to life and just as quietly negate you. It’s rude.\n\nUnfortunately, this Klay is no longer the default model. That’s not to say he’s not capable; just that expecting it is unrealistic and unfair. The spring in his step has stalled. With good reason, you know, on account of the inexorable passage of minutes and seconds, that thing that inevitably leads to the deterioration of us all. He’s older now, thicker, with more wear and tear. Yes, you can squint and see the Klay of old, and sometimes he’ll reward you for squinting with little outbursts here and there. I truly hope for Big D (really?) that he has more hardwood conflagrations left in him. From the 37 points in a single quarter to the insanely efficient 60-point game to single-handedly administering CPR to a dying Warriors squad in Game 6 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, trust that it is much more satisfying to watch the weird magic of this catatonic menace when he’s wearing your jersey.\n\nThe truth is—and maybe this is less universally accepted outside the Bay—Golden State has been a hot mess since losing the 2019 Finals, with the (rather large) exception of 2022. (You guys remember that? I was in the hospital during Game 4. Congratulations, but I lived.) Joe Lacob’s overreach, the limits of Steve Kerr’s cutting-edge (in 2016!) offense, the inconsistency of several major unnamed contributors, and Draymond Green’s predilection for attacking his own teammates (and also European big men)—it’s all been a quiet, ambient bummer. No one has taken the psychic brunt of the new Warriors so much as Klay Thompson. He had to reckon with both the dysfunction of a team in multi-year transition as well as his own physical limitations. The frustration boiled over. Grumpiness and irritation seeped into him, resulting in boneheaded late-game fouls and bouts of shooting his team out of games. Bad body language. Petulant behavior on the court. His despair manifested physically, the joy of playing the game he loved so much sloughed off him. The more he pressed against the dying of the light, the further and further away a solution seemed.\n\nA month or so after his cathartic return to the court, he opined that his lateral quickness was about 80 to 85 percent of where it once was. That seemed optimistic at the time, and it’s absolutely optimistic now. Never exactly a wizard of off-ball defense and now a regrettably grabby over-helper, post-2019 Klay is simply doing his best to stay attached to quicker guards and stronger forwards, navigating the sorry angles of a rock and a hard place. Klay’s shield-wall on-ball defense, where he truly excelled, was largely predicated on his discipline. Nothing elevated his hound-ish instincts more than being face to face with an iso-savant itching to play hero ball and quietly outlasting him. With all the assorted drama and tension that’s been regaling these Warriors for four of their last five seasons, discipline was very often a regrettable in-game casualty. I miss seeing Klay square up, cognizant of his scouting report and the conventional wisdom early in his career that he was a paper tiger on defense. I miss seeing him tear to shreds manufactured narratives by sheer force of will.\n\nThat’s a version of Klay you shouldn’t expect, though he’ll keep trying because that’s what he does, relentlessly and sometimes annoyingly. Maybe, occasionally, he’ll conjure up some anachronistic lightning in a jar on the defensive end, and that’s what we in the business world call “found money.” Dallas didn’t sign Klay because they needed a guy who used to be better than expected on defense. They signed him because they need someone to reliably make shots from deep when it matters.\n\nYou will be exasperated by him. He will go through cold snaps of what will seem like almost cartoonish inefficiency, ill-advised shots, airballs, 21-seconds-left-on-the-shot-clock heaves. You will shout at your TV; you will throw your hands in the air. But, on the other hand, maybe, just maybe, the change of scenery will ameliorate the strife coursing through his veins. He needs to get away from the Bay, from his past. He can be reborn in your (just looked it up) massive metro area. Even so, there are going to be those days, those rough days. Be kind, because no matter how dire it seems, when you check his three-point shooting at the end of the season, it’ll likely sit somewhere between 39 and 41 percent. Klay, even in a 0-for-10 game, still has 37-points-in-a-quarter gravity. Teams will plan for him. Teams will fear him. Even on inefficient nights, maybe especially so. The memory of his prime evokes danger, and that’s worth, I don’t know, probably $50 million over three years.\n\nBut who among your new Big 3 is defending the best perimeter player? Honestly, not my problem. Good luck, guys.\n\nIt hasn’t sunk in for most of us yet, his leaving. It’s a surreal thing, Klay just being gone. It almost certainly had to happen, but it doesn’t feel great, and the Mavericks’ introductory press conference yesterday was brutal on the synapses. Is this your revenge for We Believe? We’re still processing the vast finality of it all, some of us more emotionally than others, some of us steeped in sentimentality and others with the rawness of rearranging the wreckage of a salvageable crash. It’s a “have your cake and eat it, too” moment, or perhaps a “have your cake and throw it up, too” moment.\n\nThe Warriors had to choose a path, and they did. But that’s neither here nor there. The important thing is to know what you have: if not a missing piece, a piece. Even in his diminished state, Klay never stopped giving his entire self to saving the last two mediocre Warriors seasons. Sure, that entire self isn’t what it once was, but so what? He’s still valiant and made of laconic brimstone and absolutely unbothered by the moment, literally any moment, especially the biggest. The results of those big moments vary. But the courage is never in question.\n\nAlex Siquig lives in Baltimore and has written for The New Yorker, The Ringer, SFGATE, Vice, and many other outlets."
