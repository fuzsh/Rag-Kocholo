        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – So this is what the Indiana Pacers look like without Monta Ellis. They look like a defensive bully. Like an efficient, ball-moving offense. Like a group that just demolished one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThis 110-94 blowout of the Charlotte Hornets was just one game, but it was the one game — it was the one lineup change — Pacers fans have been clamoring to see. They’ve been clamoring to see less Monta Ellis, more Glenn Robinson III. Or more Rodney Stuckey. More C.J. Miles. More anybody, so long as it means less Monta Ellis.\n\nPacers fans saw it Monday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, when Ellis sat out with a balky knee, and they will see it again for the next three games — well, they will see it on television — when the Pacers hit the road and Ellis stays behind to rest that knee. What happens when the Pacers return home on Dec. 19 against the Washington Wizards?\n\nWell, it’s tricky.\n\nHere’s the thing about moving on from Monta Ellis, if that indeed is how this plays out: Putting a slowing, 12-year NBA veteran on the bench is not a move you can take back. Nor is it a move you make lightly, not if you’re Pacers coach Nate McMillan and you answer to a boss (President Larry Bird) who made Ellis the team’s marquee acquisition before last season and you lead a locker room that voted Ellis a co-captain this year. You knew that, right? The Pacers voted Paul George and Monta Ellis co-captains before this season.\n\nAnd so McMillan is left to wait and see, with success meaning one of two outcomes. One, Ellis rediscovers the explosiveness that led Bird to give him a four-year, $48 million contract before last season.\n\nSeeing how that’s not going to happen …\n\nHere’s the only way out of this situation for McMillan, for Bird, for the franchise:\n\nThe Pacers catch fire this week with Ellis out of the picture. You know: Make the decision obvious.\n\nIt’s just one game, but after this one game? The decision looks obvious.\n\nBefore Monday’s game, McMillan said something fascinating. He said the Pacers already had ball-dominant offensive players, namely Paul George and Jeff Teague but also Myles Turner, a rising star who is going to need — who is going to demand — his number to be called more and more. That’s three guys who need the ball.\n\nAnd then, McMillan was saying, there’s Monta Ellis.\n\n“He also needs the ball,” McMillan was saying before the game. “And there’s only one ball.”\n\nAnd so Ellis, who has been shockingly unselfish considering his unflattering reviews in Golden State and Dallas, has tried to fit in. He has willingly taken a back seat, allowed Teague and George to initiate the offense and Turner to get his touches. Ellis has tried to fit in, and that’s not his game. In what could be his last seven starts of the season, Ellis averaged 6.7 points in 26.8 minutes. Trying to play someone else’s game, the tentative Ellis shot just 31.1 percent from the floor, 18.2 percent on 3-pointers. He averaged a paltry 2.3 assists.\n\nWhat we saw was this: Monta Ellis needs the ball, or he might as well not start.\n\nAnd, um, that’s probably the answer. Ellis is already a defensive liability. If he can’t earn his minutes on the offensive end, then he can’t earn minutes in the starting five.\n\nLook what happened Monday night. The Pacers made life miserable for Charlotte guards Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum, who scored 25 points on 29 shots. Combined, I’m saying. They had eight assists and seven turnovers. They are the strength of the Charlotte team, and the Pacers backcourt — Jeff Teague and Glenn Robinson III — made them a weakness.\n\nThe 6-6, 222-pound Robinson, considerably bigger than Ellis (6-3, 185), was given the assignment of the 6-8 Batum. Had Ellis been healthy, the Pacers probably would have done what they usually do against Charlotte, and tried to hide him on 6-7 small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Last time these teams played, on Nov. 7 in Charlotte, Kidd-Gilchrist scored 13 points on just four shots, going 4-for-4 from the floor and 5-for-5 from the line. The Hornets posted him up on Ellis, who was helpless. The Hornets won 122-100.\n\nOn Monday? Robinson took Batum and shut him down. Paul George was fed Kidd-Gilchrist, who scored six points on 1-for-9 shooting.\n\nThat’s why this lineup change, for one game anyway, was such a success — even as Robinson was quiet statistically. He had three points, six rebounds and two assists. But he blocked three shots, recorded a steal and had zero turnovers. The ball moved on offense. The defense held Charlotte 10 points below its season average, and to 33.3 percent shooting from the floor.\n\nNow we wait to see what happens, but Phase 1 of this Robinson-for-Ellis experiment was so encouraging, it blotted out the return of Roy Hibbert, who was making his first appearance at Bankers Life Fieldhouse since leaving the team following the 2014-15 season. Hibbert came back last season with the Los Angeles Lakers, but was inactive. He wasn’t hurt that night. He just didn’t have the heart to play in front of you mean ol’ Pacers fans. You know: Roy’s gonna Roy.\n\nOn Monday night, Roy played 17 minutes. He had six points, three rebounds, a plus-minus of minus-12. Roy’s gonna Roy, and the crowd mostly wasn’t going to care. When Hibbert first entered the game late in the first quarter, the crowd barely noticed. His name drew a smattering of halfhearted boos. The reaction was much like the past few years of Roy Hibbert’s NBA career.\n\nApathetic.\n\nMeanwhile, the reaction to this new Pacers lineup was love. The Pacers got younger on Monday night. They got bigger, longer, stronger. Better? Looks like they got better.\n\nLooks like they got a lot better."
