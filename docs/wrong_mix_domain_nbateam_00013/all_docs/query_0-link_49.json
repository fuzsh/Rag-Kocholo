        "text": "Playoff breakdown\n\nKYLE LOWRY vs. GEORGE HILL\n\nHill’s role has shifted at times but one thing has remained constant: Pacers coach Frank Vogel’s belief that Hill is one of the best defensive point guards in the NBA. So is Hill really an elite perimeter defender? To answer that question, Hill will have a seven-game litmus test named Kyle Lowry.\n\nA ferocious scorer and pick-and-roll impresario, Lowry averaged 23.7 points in three games against Indiana. Lowry, as a ballhandler in pick-and-roll situations, forces defenders to make snap decisions, as Hill learned the hard way during the March 17 loss to Toronto. On a pivotal overtime play, Hill made a switch on a screen by center Bismack Biyombo and left his big, Jordan Hill, alone to defend Lowry, who hit the step-back jumper.\n\nThis season, as Paul George and Monta Ellis controlled the ball, Hill found his opportunities waiting on the perimeter and made a career-best 40.9 percent from the 3-point arc.\n\nADVANTAGE: Toronto.\n\nDeMAR DeROZAN vs. MONTA ELLIS\n\nThe 30-year-old Ellis was one of the more durable players in the league, logging 2,743 minutes and starting 81 games – he only sat the season finale after the Pacers had wrapped up the seventh seed. At times, Ellis balanced the backup point guard role as well as scoring complement to George. However, Ellis, as a ball-dominant guard, ranked among league leaders in turnovers (203).\n\nDeRozan is the other half of one of the best backcourts in the NBA, averaging a team-high 23.5 points per game (eighth in the NBA). Good luck keeping him off the foul line – DeRozan attempted more free throws (653) than any player in Raptors’ history. Furthermore, DeRozan plays as more than just a threat to attack the rim, utilizing the midrange shot as another weapon. While Lowry has scored 30 or more points eight times this season, DeRozan has hit that mark 14 times.\n\nADVANTAGE: Toronto.\n\nDeMARRE CARROLL vs. PAUL GEORGE\n\nLast summer the Raptors signed Carroll for this. Carroll has playoff experience in defending LeBron James so, of course, he would be the natural assignment to take on George. However, Carroll returns to the lineup after missing 54 games due to arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and re-inserting him into the starting lineup now can be tricky.\n\nSo Toronto will need more than Carroll. But pick a Raptor, any Raptor (James Johnson, Terrence Ross, Patrick Patterson) and George should have his way with him.\n\nThe alpha scorer on the Pacers, George averaged 23.1 points and returned to All-Star form after missing all but six games of the 2014-15 season. During his renaissance year, George became the first player in the team's NBA history to score 40 or more points three times in a season, including his career-high 48 points on Dec. 5.\n\nAlso unlike Carroll, George comes into the playoffs relatively healthy and can serve as the shut-down defender for the Pacers.\n\nADVANTAGE: Indiana.\n\nLUIS SCOLA vs. LAVOY ALLEN\n\nAllen does the dirty work that can help a team win. He doesn’t need the ball, but finds it (averaging 2.0 offensive rebounds per game) and can stretch out to defend perimeter shooters better than rookie Myles Turner. So Allen should not have a problem keeping up with the 35-year-old Scola.\n\nOnly issue – Scola has rebuilt himself into a legitimate 3-point shooting threat. In his first eight years in the NBA, Scola attempted 60 3s, hitting just 16.7 percent. In his first year in Toronto, Scola has stretched beyond the arc for 161 attempts, hitting 40.4 percent. Though Scola starts, he actually splits the power forward position with Patrick Patterson, who has attempted the third-most 3-pointers on the team (293) behind guards Kyle Lowry and Terrence Ross.\n\nADVANTAGE: Even.\n\nJONAS VALANCIUNAS vs. IAN MAHINMI\n\nMahinmi has spent his career as a rim protector. This year however, Mahinmi has added an offensive wrinkle to his game. No longer a liability when the ball swings his way, Mahinmi has career-high offensive numbers and has scored a respectable 1.11 points per possession as the roll man in pick-and-roll plays. Mahinmi finished the regular season on a hot streak, averaging 12.7 points over the final 10 games.\n\nStill Mahinmi’s offensive improvement does not match Valanciunas’ skills. Valanciunas has started 59 games but leads the team with 22 double-doubles (Toronto is 17-5 in those games). Valanciunas scored in double figures in 29 of the final 30 games.\n\nADVANTAGE: Toronto.\n\nPACERS BENCH vs. RAPTORS BENCH\n\nOn April 8, the Raptors proved how dominant their bench can be when the unit trounced the Pacers’ starters in a 111-98 victory with Lowry, DeRozan, Scola and Carroll sitting out. So while rookie backup point guard Norman Powell likely won’t hit for 27 points in this series as he did during that win, he and the bench mates should come into the playoffs with confidence.\n\nToronto’s reserves are good enough to play as starters. This year, Terrence Ross has a 31-point game and Cory Joseph once dropped 30. Also, center Bismack Biyombo plays as one of the team’s best screens as well as one of the NBA’s best shot-blockers (1.6 per game).\n\nThe Pacers’ bench unit has looked complete. Rodney Stuckey has attacked. Ty Lawson has found shooters. C.J. Miles and Solomon Hill have knocked down 3s. Also Myles Turner has flashed dominance against second-tier opponents. However this group is still relatively new, having formed on April 2.\n\nADVANTAGE: Toronto.\n\nPREDICTION: Toronto has won seven of the last eight matchups with Indiana, which includes five straight at Air Canada Centre. Raptors win in five games.\n\nPacers at Raptors, 12:30 p.m. Saturday, ESPN"
