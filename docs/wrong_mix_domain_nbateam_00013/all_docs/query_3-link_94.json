        "text": "I hope very much that you saw the Mavericks game last night against the Bulls. Mike Prada at SB Nation is calling it the game of the year so far. In a moment, I want you to follow that link and look at some clips from the game, which went into double overtime and was filled with one amazing play after another. But first I want to make an observation based on a play Monta Ellis made in the second overtime. Down by two points, with 40 seconds on the game clock and five on the shot clock — five on the shot clock — Monta calmly pulled up from about 3 feet behind the arc and drained a shot over the Bulls’ Jimmy Butler. It is my professional opinion as a licensed psychiatrist that only a psychopath tries that shot. Only someone with no conscience, someone who walks the earth doing exactly as he pleases without fear of consequences or consideration for the feelings of others would attempt that shot under those circumstances, in the second overtime of an NBA basketball contest. It is therefore my conclusion that if Monta were not playing basketball, he would be a serial killer. A really, really good serial killer who would not celebrate too much after a good kill or pout when one got away. He would just kill because he would be really good at it. And I would watch Vines of those kills. Did I go too far?\n\nIt was a great game. Now go click that link."
