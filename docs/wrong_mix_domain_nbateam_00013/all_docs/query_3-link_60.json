        "text": "* MONTA ELLIS All-Star column underneath all the pre-rambling. It’s there somewhere. (I’ll provide some stats on a future post. Too much to get through in this one.) But first, the rambling…\n\n-Interesting day for the Warriors’ mill yesterday. I was out of pocket for most of it and couldn’t/didn’t comment much on any of them, but that’s no big deal since there’s nothing imminent. Just normal Warriors churning and ping-backs.\n\nThe separate reports: The Warriors could be interested again in Amare Stoudemire (who is definitely available again), Monta Ellis might be part of trade discussions with Boston for Ray Allen, and Stephen Jackson said that he understands Don Nelson will retire after this season.\n\nThat’s a lot for one day. Even if very little of it is actually true, the separate reports certainly roiled up the Warriors’ fan base.\n\nLet’s face it, the 13-29 record (and 42-82 from the start of last season) means the Warriors SHOULD be looking at some stuff like this.\n\nBut the Warriors had to rush out and deny all of these reports, naturally.\n\nThis is what happens when GM Larry Riley opens his mouth and teases the Warriors’ populace about making moves, though the Warriors don’t have many ways to make large constructive changes.\n\nI’m sure Riley wasn’t the source for the reports, but when they come out right after he suggests the Warriors want to make a move or two, well, people are allowed to wonder.\n\nThe problem is that Riley teases, and yet what can he actually do by the Feb. 18 trade deadline? Their big possibilities:\n\n1) Get an All-Star power forward at the end of his deal.\n\nSuch as Stoudemire, Chris Bosh or Carlos Boozer–because the only way a team would trade a guy like that is if it feared him leaving as a free agent this summer\n\nThat’s Rumor No. 1!\n\nBut to make a move like that, the Warriors woul’d have to give up major young talent (Anthony Randolph or Stephen Curry) to get a player very unlikely to re-sign for the long-term.\n\nNot happening. Can’t risk the young players for a potential walk-away\n\n2) Trade Ellis at the potential height of his value for more versatile talent or cap relief (Ray Allen’s expiring contract).\n\nRumor No. 2!\n\nFYI: If the GSWs did this, the fans would be in full revolt, since they love Ellis.\n\nThe Warriors can’t move a proven ticket-seller. They might have to do that this summer, but not now, while the Warriors have 2009-2010 tickets to sell and Chris Cohan’s going day to day with the finances\n\n3) Fire Don Nelson before his contract runs out after next season.\n\nRumor No. 3–sort of.\n\nBy the way, Nelson’s NOT walking away from money. He’s not. So the GSws would have to fire him. The Warriors can’t do that.\n\nI’m not 100% sure why they can’t do that, but the Warriors management gets more defensive about Nelson and his erraticism (my words, not theirs) than it does about anything else.\n\nIt’s probably psychological: Rowell is fuming about all the terrible decisions he has made, fuming about getting blamed for them, fuming that Nelson tricked him into giving him the two-year extension, so his natural response is to defend himself (and Nelson) for all the idiocy\n\nNelson, that genius, has come to represent the full flying Warriors’ idiocy of Rowell, which means he’s completely protected. Riley, too.\n\n4) Trade their expiring contracts–Speedy Claxton, Devean George, Raja Bell–for something decent from a team that needs to cut payroll.\n\nNo rumor about that yesterday. Though Riley teases about doing this, it’ll ADD to Cohan’s payroll. I’ll believe it when I see it.\n\n—-the column/\n\nImportant message for Warriors stalwarts fretting that Monta Ellis’ recent ankle injury might greatly affect his All-Star candidacy:\n\nIt won’t change anything. At all.\n\nEllis didn’t play Saturday in Phoenix, so he was denied the chance to shoot 34 more times, score 30 more points and perform several remarkable anti-gravity twirls during the Warriors’ 112-103 defeat.\n\nHe’s very good at those things — maybe the best in the league, and getting better, health willing.\n\nAfter last season’s personal debacle, Ellis is maturing as a person and player amid the Warriors’ annual shipwreck, which is a credit to him.\n\nBut Ellis, who also won’t play tonight in Sacramento, shouldn’t and won’t be added to the West squad when the reserves are named Thursday, as decided by a vote of conference coaches.\n\nScoring lots of points in a spectacular way is not the same thing as greatness. Sorry.\n\nLet’s emphasize: Ellis isn’t an All-Star this season by any true measure, and by that I mean wins and losses.\n\nOf course, the Warriors are campaigning furiously for Ellis, with a desperation heightened by the absence of a Warriors All-Star representative since Latrell Sprewell in 1997.\n\nWon’t change anything.\n\nLet’s go over the top five reasons Ellis is on the outside looking in “…\n\n1. Coaches have a logical affinity for rewarding players who have helped their teams win games and ignoring those who haven’t.\n\nEllis’ Warriors are 13-29; somehow, his highlight plays haven’t added up to successful basketball.\n\nIf Ellis really were an elite player unluckily stuck on a terrible team, wouldn’t the Warriors automatically be better when he’s on the court and much worse when he’s off?\n\nHis 26.1 scoring average is sixth-best in the NBA, but by every efficiency statistic, the Warriors actually score at a much better rate in the rare minutes Ellis is off the floor.\n\nI won’t bore you with the stats, but Ellis is the only major scorer with the efficiency stats tilted this far against him.\n\nAnd, unlike other iron-man players on lousy teams, the Warriors have been better without Ellis (by one point a game, according to the plus-minus stats) than they have been with him throughout this season.\n\nThe Nets are terrible but have been measurably better when Brook Lopez plays. The 76ers are struggling but are marginally better when Andre Iguodala plays.\n\nThe Warriors lose points when Ellis plays. That doesn’t mean he’s a bad player. Just means Ellis is hardly blameless for the Warriors’ miseries this season.\n\n2. If Ellis were on a better team, he wouldn’t be accumulating these gaudy stats, and it’s the gaudy stats that are being trumpeted by the Ellis supporters.\n\nIt’s the bad-team stat truism: Somebody has to score, right?\n\nEllis averages 42 minutes per game (tops in the league) and 2.2 steals (No. 2 behind Rajon Rondo), puts up 22.3 shots (No. 2 behind Kobe Bryant) and also has committed a league-leading 4.1 turnovers per game.\n\nHe definitely has little help, especially because of the Warriors’ injury devastation, and often Ellis seems to keep the Warriors in games all by himself.\n\nYou could theorize that his body is wearing down because he has to carry such a huge load.\n\nBut if the reason he is being touted is his high scoring average “… and the scoring average is caused by the team’s inherent lousiness “… then how exactly does that prove Ellis is an All-Star?\n\nProbably proves the opposite.\n\n3. Ellis is clearly not at the same level as Bryant or Steve Nash (both voted into the West starting lineup by the fans) or Chris Paul (who will probably get the top reserve guard spot in the coaches’ vote).\n\nSome would argue otherwise, but I think it’s clear that Ellis is also well below Portland’s Brandon Roy and Utah’s Deron Williams — two leaders who do things that might not always get onto YouTube but help their teams win.\n\nTotal it up, and we already have five conference guards lined up ahead of Ellis. All-Star lineups often have only four guards.\n\n4. Ellis also shouldn’t be ahead of other potential candidates to fill out the roster, such as Memphis’ Zach Randolph and Rudy Gay, Houston’s Carl Landry and the Clippers’ Chris Kaman.\n\nIt’s that old wins-and-losses thing again. All of those players have contributed to many more victories than Ellis has. Which counts.\n\n5. In some future season, Ellis or another player could be leading the Warriors to a strong record — with or without huge individual stats — and truly deserve an All-Star spot.\n\nHey, it’s possible. Ellis probably will be worthy in the near future.\n\nMaybe the Warriors stalwarts should save the All-Star nagging for a time when there are team achievements that merit individual honors or an individual player that transcends the perennial horridness.\n\nThat is, if the stalwarts care about credibility. I know, I know: They’ve already proved that they don’t."
