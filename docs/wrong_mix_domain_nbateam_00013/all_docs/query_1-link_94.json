        "text": "This article needs to start with a disclaimer, because we just need to make something clear before anyone messes around and gets some funny ideas. The Golden State Warriors are not going to sign Monta Ellis. The Golden State Warriors are not going to consider signing Monta Ellis. the Golden State Warriors are not going to spend a second entertaining the silly notion of signing Monta Ellis.\n\nThere will be no reunion, so get it out of your heads now so we can move on.\n\nOK, now that we’ve moved on, Forever Warrior Monta Ellis is once again attempting a comeback. The news comes via Alder Almo of Empire Sports Media, who spoke with Ellis about the shooting guard’s NBA hopes.\n\nEllis admitted that his last stint in the NBA — in 2016-17 with the Indiana Pacers — didn’t go well because of his mental health, saying, “The 2017 Monta Ellis had a lot of things going on mentally that started to affect me physically. That’s one of the reasons why I walked away from the game. It wasn’t that I couldn’t play the game anymore. It’s just felt like that my mental health was way more important. I felt like my family and kids needed me more. There’s a lot of things that affected me off the court. I haven’t had a father in my life and I have to balance fatherhood with my NBA professional life. It was challenging.”\n\nNot that Warriors fans needed any further reason to root for Ellis, but that quote certainly provides it.\n\nEllis, now 35, spent parts of seven seasons with the Dubs, and averaged 19.6 points, 4.4 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.\n\nWe’ll always have fond memories of him ... but it would be fun to see him back on the court again some day. It just won’t be with Golden State."
