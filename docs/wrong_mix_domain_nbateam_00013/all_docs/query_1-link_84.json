        "text": "(JACKSON, Miss.) — The Sonic Boom of the South received a $60,000\n\ndonation from Monta Ellis, a former NBA shooting guard nicknamed the\n\n“Mississippi Bullet.”\n\nA Jackson native, Ellis spent 12 seasons in the NBA, which included\n\nplaying for the Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers.\n\n“I am always overjoyed and humbled when anyone donates to our students and\n\nprogram. This particular donation is unique because Monta Ellis and I grew\n\nup together in the same neighborhood,” said Dr. Roderick Little, director\n\nof bands.\n\nTogether, the young men attended Lanier High School in Jackson. There,\n\nEllis was named a McDonald’s All-American and first-team Parade\n\nAll-American. Little was on his way to becoming one of the youngest band\n\ndirectors in JSU history.\n\nIn 2005, Ellis was selected 40th overall NBA draft pick by the Golden\n\nState Warriors. As a rookie, he “wet up the court” well before the “Splash\n\nBrothers” dripped on the scene.\n\nLittle and Ellis walked different paths, both being equally fruitful.\n\nHowever, they could have easily had unfavorable outcomes.\n\n“We attended the same secondary schools that centered on indigence,” said\n\nLittle, also an assistant professor of music.\n\n“One very fundamental fact that people may overlook is that stellar people\n\ncome out of those environments and go on to be very successful outside and\n\nwithin their communities.”\n\nToday, Little and Ellis still share a mutual love and respect for one\n\nanother. Recently, the two reconnected through Ashley Robinson, vice\n\npresident and director of Athletics.\n\nDuring the conversation, Ellis expressed his support for his classmate and\n\nthe Boom. He then followed his sentiments with a philanthropic gift.\n\n“Anybody from Jackson can tell you what the Sonic Boom means to our city.\n\nGrowing up, kids either want to be a J-5 drum major or J-Sette. I believe\n\nin what Dr. Little is doing with the Boom, and I want to do whatever I can\n\nto keep making it stronger and give more students a chance to be part of\n\nthat legacy and earn an education,” said Ellis, according to Sonic Boom\n\nmedia.\n\nLittle shared that as youths they had dreams of transcending their\n\nsurroundings through their talents. And it appears they have accomplished\n\njust that.\n\n“Although he is an athlete and I’m a musician, we have our common\n\nconnection of similar outcomes that we hope will be examples for the\n\nyouth,” he said.\n\nWhat is also important, noted Little, is that the NBA baller has not\n\nforgotten his roots."
