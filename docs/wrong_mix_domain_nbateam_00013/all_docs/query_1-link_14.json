Prior to making it all the way to the NBA, Ellis began playing basketball competitively in high school where he led his team to success. Monta would regularly score higher than 40 points in a single game, and on one day he set his career high with 72 points in a single game. His production on the court was so great that he was even named the High School Player of the Year and was selected by USA Today as an All-American in his senior year of 2005. Ellis then decided to declare for the NBA Draft where he was selected by the Golden State Warriors as the 40th overall selection. He has since gone on to pay for the Milwaukee Bucks and currently with the Mavericks where he earned the NBA Most Improved Player Award early in his career.\n\nBook Monta Ellis for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Monta Ellis for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
