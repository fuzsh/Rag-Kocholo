        "text": "So many voices, so many words. I’ll do this in bits, like the last big Warriors presser, starting with a chunk from Mark Jackson, speaking informally after the official introductory presser…\n\n-First off, many of you saw or heard the official part of it and Jackson definitely was a booming presence. He was what you see on TV–charming, smart, funny…\n\nBut there were no details offered about his coaching philosophies at this point.\n\nOther than he promises the Warriors will be a defensive-minded team under his guidance. We shall see about that one, but it is a good thing to start with, no doubt.\n\nJackson also absolutely vouched for Monta Ellis in the official part, then went all-in for Ellis, at least rhetorically, afterwards. (Both Joe Lacob and Jerry West made a point of referring to Jackson’s strong support of Ellis when answering Ellis-trade questions, FYI.)\n\nCould Jackson re-direct the Warriors’ thinking AWAY from trying to trade Ellis for a bigger player or two? Is this wise? Again: We shall see.\n\nI have no idea how the Warriors would fix their size problems if they don’t move Ellis, but maybe Jackson has a plan.\n\nWe know he has opinions. Definitely has those. Today was the BOOM. The next many days we’ll see the details emerge.\n\n—–MARK JACKSON, post-presser informal gaggle/\n\n-Q: You mentioned during your interviews that you may have learned more about being a head coach in the TV production meetings than you would’ve as an assistant coach. What do you think you gained from them?\n\n-JACKSON: First of all, if I was an assistant I would’ve been hurting my family. I’ve got a great job and had a great opportunity to be involved in the game.\n\nWhat took place in those meetings, you’re talking about being down 2-1 or being up 2-1 and I’m sitting there talking to Doc Rivers or Gregg Popovich or Phil Jackson or Erik Spoelstra or Rick Carlisle. And they’re telling me their thoughts, they’re telling me their beliefs, they’re telling me their strategies.\n\nThat is an incredible learning process for me and was an incredible experience.\n\n-Q: Which of those guys did you get the most from?\n\n-JACKSON: I would say Doc Rivers, who’s an incredible coach and a great friend and has helped me a great deal. And Gregg Popovich, just sitting—we’ve never been outside the basketball arena. But just sitting there and watching him work and have an opportunity to talk to him, the way he gets it. The understanding that this is not the end-all, that this is the game of basketball, life is bigger.\n\n-Q: Can you win with a backcourt that isn’t very big?\n\n-JACKSON: You just look in the finals, and our backcourt is bigger than the ones in the finals, when you’re talking about JJ Barea starting. When you’re talking about Mike Bibby. I mean, there’s really no difference between our backcourt.\n\n[EDIT]\n\nI’m not Steph Curry and I’m not Monta Ellis and they’re not me, and what I mean by that is, I can’t wake up and get you 20-25 points. I was a facilitator. I was a guy that ran the point guard position and was a pass-first guy.\n\nThose guys are flat-out scorers and I’m going to use them to their strengths. I’m going to allow them to be playmakers and to be aggressive offensively.\n\nAll I ask or all I demand is for them to get it done defensively.\n\n-Q: You’ve said how much you like Monta Ellis. Would you be upset if they traded him?\n\n-JACKSON: That will be something that we talk about all together. I want Monta Ellis on this basketball team.\n\nNow that being said, if they traded Monta Ellis for Dwight Howard or LeBron James, I mean…\n\n-Q: That’s what it’ll take?\n\n-JACKSON: I think this guy is a big-time player. And I think he’s the third best shooting guard in the league. You have Kobe obviously and Dwyane Wade. I will match him up against anybody else on a given night and feel extremely comfortable about it.\n\nThat being said, in this league, anybody is up to be traded…\n\n-Q: So does it bother you that there are reports that Ellis could be traded?\n\n-JACKSON: No, it doesn’t bother me. There were reports that somebody else would be the next head coach of the Golden State Warriors. You’ve just got to let this thing play out as a player or a person that’s being talked about and then just be prepared. Things will work out.\n\n-Q: Do you think the Warriors have worse defensive personnel than an average team?\n\n-JACKSON: No. You look at the teams that’s still playing, they’re more than capable of defending. The problem is, I don’t know what was emphasized.\n\nI know what will be emphasized and I know what will be demanded and we’re excited about being a very good defensive team.\n\n-Q: When you said the Bay Area will never be the same, what did you mean?\n\n-JACKSON: When you look at the success of the teams in this area, the A’s, they’ve had their great times. The Niners certainly have had theirs. The Giants have had theirs. The Raiders have had theirs.\n\nAnd now we’re looking forward to ours. So therefore it’s our time. Sorry it took so long, but now we’re at the party.\n\n-Q: What did Chris Mullin tell you about this opportunity and this franchise?\n\n-JACKSON: Chris is a great friend and Hall of Fame basketball player who I truly believe I wouldn’t have been pro if I didn’t meet him, because he taught me how to not just be a gym rat but to be a gym technician….\n\nHe didn’t know until basically it was done. He knew I was involved in it. And he told me it was a great area and a great organization with great fans. He thought it would be a home run for me…\n\n-Q: Mullin did not leave this franchise on good terms. If I remember correctly you stuck up for him on TV when he was being forced out—by different ownership. Was that all in your mind going into this?\n\n-JACKSON: This is a new group. I can’t speak on the previous group that were in position of ownership when Chris Mullin was here. That’s old news. What I do know is that he’s a great basketball mind. He’s a Hall of Fame basketball player and there’s no question about his ability to be part of a successful situation.\n\nObviously, as a friend and as a brother, it was harmful and it hurt me watching him go through that process. The same way that it’s going to be a joyous time for him today and also when this thing turns around for this organization."
