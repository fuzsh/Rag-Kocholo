OAKLAND, Calif. — Monta Ellis had 27 points and 10 assists, Dorell Wright finished with 26 points and the Golden State Warriors scored an NBA season-high 84 points in the first half in a 138-101 rout of the Toronto Raptors on Friday night.

Stephen Curry added 23 points and eight assists to help the Warriors snap a six-game losing streak in blowout fashion. The first-half point total topped this season’s previous high of 80 set by Denver in a 127-99 victory over Cleveland.

DeMar DeRozan, Leandro Barbosa and Ed Davis scored 19 points each in a demoralizing defeat for a Toronto team also assured of missing the playoffs. They trailed by 26 points at the half, by 47 in the fourth quarter and were never competitive.

The Raptors also lost Jose Calderon to a strained left hamstring. The injury did not appear serious, but it could sideline him against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night.

Toronto’s off-season couldn’t come soon enough.

The Warriors turned things into a personal highlight show: Curry threw a full-court pass that led to a dunk by Wright; Ellis sliced his way through the paint for several sizzling layups; and Curry, Ellis and Wright combined to go 7-for-9 from beyond the arc in the opening half alone.

The result was a complete dismantling of the Raptors in every offensive phase.

Golden State shot 68 per cent in the half, 77 per cent from long range, out-rebounded Toronto 20-12 and had 20 assists.

Not that the Warriors were done after the break.

They continued the offensive onslaught in the third quarter, giving fans at least a little incentive to stay for a team all but assured of missing the post-season again. David Lee, who had 21 points and seven rebounds, also made a rare three-pointer. A series of alley-oops and uncontested dunks ensued, and the Warriors went up 47 in the fourth and never relented.
