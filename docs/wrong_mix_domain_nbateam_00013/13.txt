TORONTO (Reuters) - High-scoring Golden State guard Monta Ellis suffered a back injury that forced him out of his team's 109-102 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Monday.

Ellis, who entered the contest as the NBA's leading scorer with 27.8 points per game, took an awkward tumble at the end of the fourth quarter and remained on the court before being assisted off for X-rays.

"We are waiting until our trainers tell me what they see," Golden State coach Keith Smart told NBA.com. "I did get a chance to see him, and the spirit that he is in is good but we don't know what the result will be until later."

Ellis scored 28 points for the Warriors before leaving the game. He scored a career-high tying 46 points in his team's season-opening win over the Houston Rockets and his fast start has helped the Warriors to a 5-2 record.
