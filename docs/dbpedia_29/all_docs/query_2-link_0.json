        "text": "Author(s): Flomen, Max | Advisor(s): Aron, Stephen A | Abstract: This dissertation examines the role of slaving during the encounter between indigenous societies and Euro-American empires in the Texas borderlands from 1700 to 1840. Historians have generally overlooked the structures that bound continental and Atlantic slave systems together. In this multipolar borderland pastoral and plantation modes of production conflicted and comingled, drawing all participants into a “cruel embrace” rife with possibilities for exploitation, destruction, and reinvention. Indigenous war leaders, Euro-American traders, and captives of all nations made their own histories of enslavement and abolition. The dissertation charts the formation of French and Spanish colonies in Louisiana and Texas during the eighteenth century, where forced, long-distance transfers placed indigenous and African populations into plantation and mission regimes. Slaving figured prominently in the confrontation of these band ...\n\nIn 1992, the Southeast Regional Office of the National Park Service developed a National Historic Landmark Theme Study based on previous landmark theme studies, historic context documents from Southeastern and American Caribbean State office, and over 200 historians, architects, and archaeologists. The intent of this work was to identify potential National Historic Landmarks and then proceed to develop landmark studies. About 40 properties were listed in the National Register of designated by the Secretary of the Interior as NHLs. Since publication of this planning document a number of these properties have been preserved for interpretation and/or research. The properties included Historic Native American, Colonial and early American sites, structures and buildings.\n\nThis paper, intended for the non-specialist, reviews the historical and current status of the native languages of the southeastern United States. Each of the languages families is described and discussed, and an overview of language and culture issues is presented, with suggestions for further research."
