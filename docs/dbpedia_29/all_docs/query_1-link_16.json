        "text": "Dear Marion\n\nfollowing is some info I had on file\n\nfrom http://www.rootsweb.com/~msmadiso/history.htmhttp://www.rootsweb.com/~msmadiso/history.htm\n\nDoak's Stand [Mile Marker 108] - In 1820, Andrew Jackson met with leaders of the Choctaw Indians at Doak's Tavern, which had been established in 1812 by William Doak. After spending several days trying to convince the Indians to willingly give up their land and move west, Jackson finally threatened to issue an order that would force Indian resettlement. Faced with enforced resettlement, the Indians finally gave up 1/3 of their land, and, on October 20, 1820, signed the Treaty of Doak's Stand. Ten years later, the Choctaws were forced to relinquish the remaining land. [The actual location of Doak's Tavern was west of the present Trace, and is no longer in existance.]\n\nfrom http://www.tc.umn.edu/~mboucher/mikebouchweb/choctaw/ctowns.htmhttp://www.tc.umn.edu/~mboucher/mikebouchweb/choctaw/ctowns.htm\n\nDoaksville - ghost town was former capitol\n\nShortly after the treaty called Doak's Stand between the Choctaw Indians and the United States was signed in Mississippi in 1820, Josiah S. Doak and his brother moved westward, for they believed the Choctaws would soon migrate. Thus, they loaded their goods on boats and navigated the Mississippi and Red Rivers to a point near the mouth of the Kiamichi River. From that point the goods were moved inland to a place near Witches Hole.\n\nmore (too much to include here) on Doaksville at http://www.geocities.com/zorrothefox2000/articles/thehugodailynews/1999/doaksville.htmlhttp://www.geocities.com/zorrothefox2000/articles/thehugodailynews/1999/doaksville.html\n\nfrom a Google search, referencing http://www.tngenweb.org/tnfirst/csw1-98b.htmhttp://www.tngenweb.org/tnfirst/csw1-98b.htm but which I had to access from a Google-cached copy\n\nhttp://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:Gm864pFhNB4C:www.tngenweb.org/tnfirst/csw1-98b.htm++%22doak%27s+stand%22+william+brother+josiah&hl=en&ie=UTF-8http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:Gm864pFhNB4C:www.tngenweb.org/tnfirst/csw1-98b.htm++%22doak%27s+stand%22+william+brother+josiah&hl=en&ie=UTF-8\n\nDOAK, FANNIN, FANNING, FRAZIER, COLBERT, LOVE\n\nLooking for information on William DOAK, whom we find in Lincoln County, Tennessee but who later formed the trading post known as Doak's Stand in Madison County, Mississippi. Looking for the name of his wife who was most likely Chickasaw, but could have been Choctaw. However due to where he lived Chickasaw is more probable. I am descended from his daughter Sally DOAK who married Thomas FANNIN (G). They left Tennessee and lived near a group of Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians in east Texas. William's brother Josiah relocated to the Choctaw Nation, I.T. where he formed the trading post known as Doaksville. Their son William Moore FANNIN married Sarah HOUGHTON or HORTON who was the grand daughter of Cherokee Chief William HICKS. Their daughter Willie Virginia FANNIN married Robert Lee THOMPSON (my gr. grandparents) also a mix-blood Choctaw from Mississippi (the family claimed Choctaw on Dawes Commission testimony, but he is the gr gr grandson of Sally MCCOY on the 1818 Chickasaw census).\n\nJ.C. Thompson -- 920 E. Escondido # F, Kingsville, TX 78363\n\n[email protected]\n\nSubmitted on Sun Apr 19 13:50:58 EDT 1998\n\nhttp://www.chahta.org/ancestralroll.htmhttp://www.chahta.org/ancestralroll.htm site not currently available\n\nincludes William's daughter Sally Doak\n\nand from http://www.chahta.org/thompsonchoctawphoto.htmhttp://www.chahta.org/thompsonchoctawphoto.htmsite not currently available\n\nIn 1851 Archibald Thompson, the brother of William, returned to Texas leading a group of Choctaws to Mount Tabor. The Choctaws along with the Cherokee Harnage's and Cooper's settled to the southwest of the original community just across the Smith County line near present day Overton, Texas. Along with Archibald were the sons of his brother William and four sons of his brother Henry. Thus the foundations for the community were laid. Additional Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek families moved into the area, but for most this was only temporary. With the death of Bill Berryhill, (of which Berryhill Creek in Rusk County was named after) all of the Muscogee (Creek) families left the area, some joining the Alabama-Coushatta in Polk County and others making the trip into the Creek Nation with the Pakana Muscogees. The majority of the Cherokees left the area following the death of Chief John Ross in 1866. Ross was seen as the arch villain to the Ridge Party Cherokees and his death along with the end of the Civil War was seen as a sign for better times in the Cherokee Nation. Among the Choctaws that came to Mount Tabor, was the family of Thomas Fanning an Irishman and his half blood Choctaw wife Sally Doak-Fanning. Sally was the granddaughter of Mingo Apukshunnubbee and the daughter of Trader William Doak (by his second wife), the owner of Doak's Stand where a major treaty of the Choctaw was signed between the nation and the United States government. Two of their granddaughters, Inez Monterey and Willie Ann Virginia Fannin married local Choctaw-Chickasaws. They were the daughters of William Moore Fannin and his wife Sarah Horton. Sarah was the daughter of J.R. Horton a whiteman and Elizabeth Hicks who was half Chickasaw and one-eighth Cherokee. The rest of the Fanning family, with the exception of one other son, did not maintain ties to the Choctaw Nation and faded into the dominant society. The other son who proved to be the exception was Nathaniel Fannin who died at Willis, Chickasaw Nation in 1891. His death before the start of the allotment period meant that his children who left with their white mother for Arkansas would not be included on the Final Rolls of the Choctaw Nation.\n\nfrom\n\nhttp://www.nativeweb.org/resources/us_tribal_websites/us_tribal_pages_bia_not_recognized_/http://www.nativeweb.org/resources/us_tribal_websites/us_tribal_pages_bia_not_recognized_/\n\n(East) Texas Band of Choctaw Indians\n\nSmall Choctaw tribe in east Texas, known historically as the Yowani Choctaw but in association with the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands from 1843-1999. Party to Treaty of 1836 with the Republic of Texas. Law suits with the Texas Cherokees against Texas in 1871 and 1914. Litigation before the United States Supreme Court in 1921 related to Treaty of 1836 and the Indian Claims Commission in 1948. Member law suits against the Choctaw Nation dealing with enrollment as citizens by blood of the Choctaw Nation 1895-1909: William C. Thompson et al vs. Choctaw Nation; William Starr Jones et al vs. Choctaw Nation and William Spring et al vs. Choctaw Nation.\n\nThis band, incidentally, was for some time settled in and around Mount Tabor and is sometimes referred to as the Mount Tabor Indian Community\n\nsee also\n\nhttp://members.aol.com/txcherind/thompson-mccoy_chickasaw-choctaw/http://members.aol.com/txcherind/thompson-mccoy_chickasaw-choctaw/\n\nHope this is of some interest\n\nRalph\n\nps there is some (considerable) doubt as to exactly which William Doak was Sally's father .. but both candidates known to me would have been grandsons of my ancestor John Doak and his wife Mary"
