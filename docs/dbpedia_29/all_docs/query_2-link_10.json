Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 318, S. 282, a bill to provide Federal recognition of the Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians of Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. I do object to the unanimous-consent request, Madam President. As I understand the request, this is asking unanimous consent that a bill be passed granting legislative recognition to the Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians of Alabama. Mr. FORD. That is correct. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. FORD. Did the Senator object? Mr. COCHRAN. I do not object--Madam President, my objection goes to the passage of the bill, not to the calling up of the bill. I have expressed my opposition to the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you. Mr. FORD. As I understood it, Madam President, the Senator reserved the right to object to my unanimous consent, stated his purpose, and it is now up to the Chair to put the unanimous-consent agreement. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. COCHRAN. I object to the passage of the bill by unanimous consent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to the bill. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 282), to provide Federal recognition of the Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians of Alabma. The Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Opposition to S. 282, The Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians Recognition Act Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I want to express my opposition because of the inconsistency and unfairness that this kind of action leads to for groups petitioning for recognition by the Federal Government as a legally established entity under current law, entitled to the same kind of benefits, health care services, education, and housing benefits that native American tribes are entitled to under the laws of the United States. This petitioning group has filed an application of longstanding with the Department of the Interior, which has the responsibility for administering this recognition program. There are established criteria by statute which must be met in order for petitioners to be certified as eligible for Federal recognition. This group has not met the test of those established criteria. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is led by Chief Phillip Martin, who testified before our Select Committee on Indian Affairs, very persuasively and eloquently as to why recognition should not be granted by Congress as requested by this bill. Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I oppose S. 282, which would grant Federal recognition to the Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians of Alabama. The matter of granting legislative recognition to nonrecognized groups of Indian people is clearly a controversial issue. In my opinion all who seek Federal recognition should go through the acknowledgment process administered by the Department of the Interior and meet the established criteria. Legislative recognition creates a dual system, one in which the Congress applies no criteria, and the other where the Interior Department applies a set of statutory, established criteria. Congress should not grant Federal recognition because it leads to inconsistency and unfairness for petitioning groups. As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I have observed funding for Indian programs lags far behind equivalent Federal programs. Native Americans generally suffer the worst conditions of unemployment, the lowest life expectancy, and least adequate education of all national groups. Our government has a responsibility to native Americans based on treaties, statutes, and Federal court rulings. Federal acknowledgment establishes a perpetual government-to-government relationship between the tribe and United States, which has major political, social, and economic implications for the petitioning tribe and Federal, State, and local governments. Congress has created special programs for federally recognized tribes, including housing, educational assistance, social services, and medical benefits. To qualify for the protection, benefits, and services available to federally recognized tribes, a group must satisfy the requirements for recognition established by the Department of Interior. These qualifications are as follows: First, the Indian group is identifiable by historical evidence, written or oral, as being an American Indian tribe; Second, its members must have existed as a distinct Indian community throughout history until the present; Third, the Indian group must have maintained political influence over its members as an autonomous entity throughout history until the present; Fourth, the membership of the group is composed principally of persons who are not members of any other Indian tribe; and Fifth, the tribe has not been the subject of congressional legislation expressly terminating their relationship with the Federal Government. While the 3,000 members of the Mowa group deserve every benefit and protection afforded by our constitutional system, I do not support S. 282 because it would entitle the Mowa to all federally funded services by circumventing the established administrative recognition process--a process developed in 1978 with the support of Indian tribal governments, Congress, and the administration to ensure objective and uniform evaluation. According to a 1992 statement by the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of S. 282 to the American taxpayers is estimated at $10 million a year. This expenditure would have a profound effect on federally recognized tribes which have met the established requirements I previously listed. I believe it is a bad precedent to depart from the existing requirements of law in controversial recognition cases. It creates an exception based on evidence that is in sharp dispute regarding the legitimacy of petitions. I hope the Senate will exercise restraint in the future when considering exceptions to the rule. I am, however, not opposed to the Mowa tribe seeking Federal recognition. I merely believe that the tribe should follow the same recognition process as other groups petitioning the Federal Government. The Federal acknowledgment process does not seek to determine if an individual is or is not Indian, it merely establishes the authenticity of a sovereign legal entity. Senator McCain and I recently introduced S. 1844, the Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1994, to improve and strengthen the administrative recognition process. If the current administrative process needs reform, then we as Members of Congress should place a stronger emphasis on comprehensively correcting the process, not circumventing the current system. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. Phillip Martin, chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, to the chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs together with testimony submitted by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on this subject be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Philadelphia, MS, July 12, 1991. Hon. Daniel K. Inouye, Chairman, Select Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Inouye: We very much appreciate your giving us the time needed to comment on S. 362, the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indian Recognition Act. As you know, I had a prior commitment on the day of the Committee's hearing on S. 362; and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide the Committee my position in writing. Attached is a study on the MOWA question which was carried out by an anthropologist on our staff. It demonstrates to me that without a doubt the members of the MOWA community had some Choctaw ancestors in the remote past. (Of the 30 first- generation Indian ancestors listed in the MOWA documentation, only 16 are identified as Choctaws, and of these, only one, Alexander Breashears, appeared on the Armstrong Roll of 1831, the listing of all Choctaw households east of the Mississippi compiled prior to the Removal to the Indian Territory.) But descendency to some fractional degree by some people does not make them an Indian tribe. There are areas of culture and political relationships that more closely define a tribe, areas reflected to some extent in the current Bureau of Indian Affairs federal acknowledgement process and in your, Senator McCain's, and Senator Cochran's effort to legislatively mandate such a process, S. 1315. It has only been within the last ten to 20 years that the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been aware there were people in Washington and Mobile counties, Alabama, claiming Choctaw descent. Some members of that community have visited the reservation here in Mississippi to study tribal customs; and some tribal members here have been paid by the MOWAs to come over to teach that community Choctaw dances and the Choctaw language (although currently we know of no one there that does speak the language.) Our people could discern no Choctaw customs extant among the MOWA population at the time of our first contacts with them; and insofar as we are aware, the only traditional Choctaw customs now practiced in the MOWA community have resulted from instruction by members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. These activities were carried out by individual members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and did not constitution any form of recognition by the tribal government of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. In their attempt to obtain legislative recognition, the members of the MOWA community make three arguments that are either factually incorrect or historically inaccurate, and which I would like to address. First, they repeatedly invoke the provisions of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830. The only parts of what is now Alabama affected by the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek were portions of Sumter, Greene, Pickens, and Choctaw counties. Washington and Mobile counties, the home of the MOWA community, had been previously ceded under the Treaty of Hoe Buckintoopa (1803), and the treaty with the British of 1765. Secondly, the MOWA community maintains that because it receives federal funding from the Administration for Native Americans, the Office of Indian Education Programs of the U.S. Department of Education, and HUD, the federal government already recognizes the community. The receipt of these funds because of the community's status as state-recognized has nothing to do with the question of the community's federal recognition, which is a totally separate issue. Finally, the members of the MOWA community are arguing that a failure of the Congress to act positively on this bill would be an abandonment of the Congressional power to handle ``commerce with the Indian tribes'' as provided for in the United States Constitution. We believe, to the contrary, that the Constitution provides for a government to government relationship only with those Indian tribes that are federally recognized, and that such recognition (as with foreign nations and the State Department) should for the most part be a function of the executive branch, and not of the Congress. The Congress saw fit in the 1930's to limit services (and thus tribal membership) to Mississippi Choctaws to persons of one-half or greater degree demonstrable Mississippi Choctaw blood quantum. For the Congress to approve legislation that would now offer these same services to Alabama ``Choctaws'' of conceivably minuscule blood quanta would seem to us patently unfair. While we have no argument with groups asserting their rights under the Federal Acknowledgement Process of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, when specific legislation is introduced, we as Choctaws do have the right to be concerned about the name ``Choctaw'' being misrepresented and the historical record being distorted. It appears to me that if the Congress took the initiative to legislatively recognize tribes outside of land claims cases, it would open the door for many, many other groups in the Southeast to submit bills, based on tenuous historical claims--a precedent the Congress would not want to have to concern itself with on a regular basis which could result in making a mockery of the historic government to government relationship that the Congress has maintained with bona fide tribes throughout the country. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians respectfully urges the members of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs to table S. 362 and to encourage the MOWA community to pursue the established process for recognition through the Department of the Interior. Sincerely, Phillip Martin, Chief. Comments on the MOWA Band of Choctaw (By Kenneth H. Carleton, M.A., Choctaw Tribal Anthropologist/ Ethnohistorian; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Introduction The ``MOWA'' are a group of people who live in northern Mobile county and southern Washington county, Alabama, in an area roughly bounded by the towns of Citronelle, Mt. Vernon, McIntosh and Tibbie. They have been known as the Alabama ``Cajans'' since that name was applied to them in the 1880s. Although they have never liked this name, it is a useful term to distinguish them. These people are the descendants of many of the early settlers in this area and are a unique mixture of both genetic and cultural heritages. Over the past century, an enormous amount of material has been written about the ``Cajans'' by numerous people. There have been several articles in scholarly journals and church publications and at least three Masters theses which discuss the social, cultural and genetic backgrounds of these people. From the late 1920s onward, there are published accounts of them about every ten to twenty years. Therefore, the documentary background available on their social and cultural practices in really rather good, which is unusual for a group like this. Historical Background of the Area The initial European settlement of the Mobile Bay area took place in 1702 when the French under Iberville founded Fort Louis de la Louisiane north of modern-day Mobile. At this time, or within a few years, several small Indian tribes were living along the Mobile and Tombigbee Rivers north of Mobile. These tribes included the Mobile, the Tohome, the Appalachee and the Teansa, among others. The Mobile The Mobile Indians were living on the Mobile River approximately five miles below the confluence of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers at the time of initial contact with the French and Spanish. By ca. 1730, they had moved to the mouth of the Mobile River where they stayed until 1763 when they disappear from the documentary record. The Tohome The Tohome were also present in the Mobile area at initial contact. There were apparently two groups (village ?) of them which were known as the Big Tohomes and the Little Tohomes or Naniabas. They continued to live there at least until they too disappear from the documentary record in the early 1770s. The Appalachee The Appalachee where initially contacted by De Soto in central Florida and were missionized by the Spanish in the early seventeenth century. They lived primarily around the mission of San Luis, which was located in present-day Tallahassee. During the winter of 1703/04, an English-led raid from Charlestown, South Carolina (modern Charleston), destroyed San Luis and killed or captured as slave over 1,000 of the Appalachee. The survivors of this disaster fled to the Pensacola area. By the end of 1705 they had come to Mobile, where the settled under the protection of the French. In 1763 with the end of the French and Indian War, France was forced out of North America and England was granted all of France's territories east of the Mississippi. At this time the Appalachee in Mobile were jointed by other groups of Appalachee. In 1764, the newly reunited Appalachee, the Taensa, and the Pakana bank of Creeks all removed themselves to the Red River in Louisiana, in order to avoid English dominion. The Taenas At initial contact with the French, the Taensa were living on the Mississippi River. However, at the encouragement of the French by ca. 1715 they had moved all of their people to the Mobile area. They remained there until 1764, when they went to the Red River with the Appalachee. These groups where not the only Indian presence in the Mobile area. Throughout the eighteenth century, particularly during the French Period (1702-1763), there was a constant flow of Indians, including Choctaw, Chickasaw, and various Creek groups, who came to Mobile to trade, receive presents and discuss important matters with the Europeans there. However, by the last two decades of the eighteenth century, there were no organized groups of Indians living in the area around Mobile. The English took control of Mobile and its environs after 1763. They controlled the area until the American Revolution. In 1765, the British held the Congress of Mobile with the Choctaw Nation. At this Congress the Choctaw agreed to cede all territory south of the 31 deg. Parallel, between the Tombigbee River and the Mississippi River and the Natchez District to the British. In 1780, the Spanish took advantage of the conflict between the British and their former colonists and systematically invaded every non-Spanish port along the Gulf of Mexico. In March of 1780, a force of Spanish soldiers, a large number of which were Negroes and mulattos from South America and probably the Caribbean, took Mobile. By the middle of 1781 the entire Gulf Coast, from Florida to Louisiana, was under Spanish dominion. In 1783, at the end of the American Revolution, the British ceded all their territory south of Canada to the United States with the southern boundary along the Gulf Coast being set at the 31 deg. Parallel. During the next decade, especially when operating under the Articles of Confederation, the United States were not in a position to enforce this southern boundary with the Spanish. The Spanish encroached beyond this line in several places including the Mobile area, where they had a fort at St. Stephens, almost forty miles north of the 31 deg. Parallel. Finally in 1795, the now stronger United States was able to force the Treaty of San Lorenzo which held the Spanish to the 31 deg. Parallel. In this same year, the Mississippi Territory was formed with the 31 deg. Parallel as its southern border and Natchez as its capital. It is at this time that a number of significant treaties with the Choctaw pertinent to this area began to be signed. treaty of hoe buckintoopa, 1803 On August 31, 1803, the Treaty of Hoe Buckintoopa was signed. This treaty ceded all Choctaw claims to the area bounded by the Chickasawhay River, on the west; Buckatunna Creek, Red Creek and Santa Bogue Creek on the north; and the Tombigbee River, on the east and the 31 deg. Parallel on the south. This area covers the eastern extremes of present-day Wayne and Greene counties, Mississippi, and the northern extreme of present-day Mobile County and all except the extreme northern portion of present-day Washington County, Alabama. treaty of mount dexter, 1805 On November 16, 1805, the Treaty of Mount Dexter was signed. This treaty ceded Choctaw territory across the southern portion of Mississippi and into Alabama, which included the southern portion of present-day Choctaw County, Alabama, and the remaining portion of present-day Washington County, to the Tombigbee River. treaty of st. stephens, 1816 On October 24, 1816, the Treaty of St. Stephens was signed. This treaty ceded all Choctaw lands east of the Tombigbee River, from the Chickasaw/Choctaw boundary to the northern limit of the area ceded by the Treaty of Mt. Dexter. In 1817 Mississippi was admitted to the Union as a state. Alabama followed in 1819, thus ending the Mississippi Territory. This set the stage for the coming of the ancestors of the group known as the Alabama ``Cajans'' to the area north of Mobile. the alabama ``cajans'' The very name ``Cajan'', which was first applied to them in the 1880s, demonstrates that from a very early period these people have been recognized as a distinct group. They are what anthropologists and sociologist call an ``isolate''. That is, a subcultural group which due to some form of isolation has developed its own society and culture independent of the mainstream society which surrounds it. Numerous examples of such isolates are known and include such groups as the Polynesians of Hawaii or Tahiti, isolated by thousands of miles of open ocean; or Appalachia in the mountains of Tennessee, Kentucky and several other states, where the eighteenth and nineteenth century settlers from primarily the British Isles became isolated by the rugged terrain which surrounded them and resulted in a society which more closely resembled that of early nineteenth century Britain than twentieth century North America with elements that are uniquely their own thrown in; on some of the barrier islands along the coast of Virginia, the language that is spoken is not that of modern American English but more closely resembles that of Elizabethan English which the original settlers of these island spoke. The ``Cajans'' of Alabama were not isolated from the mainstream society by great physical barriers. There are no enormous mountains which surround them or miles of ocean which separate them from their neighbors. Their isolation was a social isolation. These people are the descendants of a mixed genetic and social heritage. Many of the ancestors of this group were white, but many were also ``mulattos'' of mixed black and white or Indian backgrounds and many were part Indian and part white. They were not accepted by the mainstream white society and they refused to participate in the black society. The mixed nature of their cultural and genetic heritage is very diverse. They are the descendants of American Indians (they themselves claim Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Houma and even Apache), French, English, Spanish, Mexican, German, Russian and African sources from the Southeast and the Caribbean. This has resulted in a blending of the genetic and cultural heritages from all of these sources. They are not black, white or Indian but an unique mix of all three. social isolation Because of the mixed heritages of this group and the relatively remote area in which they lived, the members of this community became isolated from the mainstream society at a very early time. They were already recognized as a separate community, with their own cultural and social structure by the 1880s. This implies that almost from the beginning, they kept to themselves and only minimally interacted with the outside world. This isolation was probably caused by several factors. First was their mixed genetic heritage. Although many of them appeared to be white, as attested to by the censuses in which they are listed as such, many more of them could not. They did not appear to be black, but they definitely were not white, which resulted in them being shunned by most white society. They, on the other hand, refused to be considered black, since they considered that insulting. So, the only option which they had was to stay away from the white society which did not accept them as part of it and to remain apart from the black society in which they refused to interact. family histories The historical antecedents of the Alabama ``Cajans'' are numerous and varied. Some of their ancestors were French colonial settlers or the children of French settlers. These include Juzans and the Chestangs families, both of who were well established in the area north of Mobile by the 1770s. Some of the ancestors of this group were newer immigrants. The best known of these, and one of the most prominent early ancestors of the Alabama ``Cajans'' is Daniel Reed. Reed is listed as a freed Negro in Toulmin's digest of Alabama Laws, and since Toulmin probably knew Reed, this should be accurate. According to family legend, Reed came from San Domingo and was a mulatto of mixed African and either French or Spanish parentage. It is not known exactly when Daniel Reed came to this area, but by 1818 he had established himself well enough to have purchased a mulatto slave named Rose--presumably from Young Gaines, Perry County, MS--whom he married. In 1818 Reed was able to get an Act of the Alabama Territorial Legislature to emancipate Rose. Two years later, Reed got a second Act from the legislature to emancipate two of his, and presumably Rose's children. In all of these acts, Daniel Reed is listed as a ``free man of color'' and Rose and the children are referred to as ``mulatto''. In 1828, Daniel Reed purchased his son George from Young Gaines. The names of all of Daniel and Rose Reed's children are recorded at his death in 1844. They are: Julia Ann, Eliza, George, Matilda Ann, William, Reuben, Lucretia and Emaline. All are attested to being free persons of color, being the children of free persons of color, by the local county court judge at the time of Daniel Reed's death. Of this second generation, four of the Reeds' daughters all married the following white men: Peter Cole, Willis Daugherty (married Emeline), John Harris, and Nedham Bryant Married Matilda); Lucretia never married and the sons, George, William and Reuben, married Ellen, Lovinda, and Emeline Weaver, in that order. The Weavers are one of the other founding families of the Alabama ``Cajans'' and these daughters are purported to have been half Cherokee from their father. Based on the 1870 Census data in Green, 1941, these marriages took place in the late 1840s and early 1850s. It should be noted here that Rose Reed is claimed by her descendants to have been half Choctaw. However, there is no documentary evidence to prove this statement while there is a great deal of evidence to prove that she was a Negro slave. In one major court case (Barbara Young, et al, vs Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, Alabama, 1930) the judge, while sounding sympathetic to their case, because of the evidence presented and the laws of Alabama was forced to rule that Rose was indeed Negro and that there was nothing but hearsay evidence to support the claim of Choctaw heritage. It is unnecessary here to go into a detailed discussion of the histories of all of the other families which were the founders of the Alabama ``Cajans''; although inadequately documented, they are presented in detail in Matte, et al, n. d., However it is necessary to make several observations. The three most common surnames among this group are Reed, Weaver and Byrd. The Reed line has already been discussed. The Weaver line purportedly trace its origins back to Dave Weaver, who was a Cherokee and listed as living at Sharp Mt., Georgia, on the 1835 Cherokee Roll. The Byrd line traces its beginnings to Lemuel Byrd, purported to be a mixed-blood Cherokee, also from Georgia, who moved into the Mobile area after service in the War of 1812. All of these families, and many others, intermarried extensively beginning in the 1820's and 1830. Among them were probably many half- or part-blood Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Cherokee. However, the documentary evidence for these blood lines is ambiguous or non-existent. The majority of their claims are based solely on family reminiscences. The fact of the matter is that most families in Mississippi and Alabama which came to these areas as early as those of the Alabama ``Cajans'' probably do have at least some Indian blood. However, there is a great deal more to being an Indian than simply having the genetic heritage. There are cultural and social aspects of ``Indianness'' which more than anything else make Indians what they are. social and cultural aspects of alabama `'cajans'' Because so much was written about them in the 1930s we have a good sample of the social aspects and culture of the ``Cajans'' at a period before there was extensive influence on them from the outside. It should be pointed out that at the time the various authors were listing the ``Cajans'' in the '30s, these people led a life of abject poverty. There were virtually no roads in the areas in which they lived and travel was primarily by foot or horseback; virtually no electricity was available and there was no running water. The houses they lived in were shacks which are described by many of the authors as being even more decrepit and dilapidated than the local blacks' houses. There was little furniture or other household goods in many of the homes. Some of them had access to kerosene lamps but the majority of households were still using fat-pine torches as their main source of illumination after dark. At this time only a few houses had radios or phonographs and the majority of people had never even been to Mobile, just a few minutes automobile ride away. The overwhelming majority of them were illiterate. They were not only isolated from the society of their neighbors, they were cut off from virtually all influence from the outside world. This situation began to change in the 1930s as several church mission efforts began by establishing schools and churches in the area. The young people began to be educated. After World War II, the outside world began to have more influence within the local area and with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the abolition of segregation the situation has radically changed. Therefore, at the time that some of the earliest information about these people is available, they had changed very little from their forebears in the nineteenth century. This gives us an opportunity to see what the social and cultural situation of these people was before it had been extensively influence or disrupted by the popular American culture of the time. The picture which we get of this group is one of nineteenth-century, southern, lower-economic, white culture. It resembles the culture of the Appalachian areas on more than a superficial level. The primary social organization is based on extended-family kinship groups. And in a society as closed and intermarried as this one, everyone was related to everyone else in some way. The basic unit of socio-political power among these people is the ``settlement'' which is a community of people living together around institutions such as churches and schools and a general store, if the community was large enough. Settlements can be further subdivided into ``neighborhoods'' which represent different extended-family lines (clans) within the settlement. The residency pattern is patrilocal; when a couple from different settlements gets married they live in the settlement of the husband's family. Each neighborhood has a head who is selected informally and the selection is primarily based on his qualifications as a religious leader. It is also primarily an achieved status (rather than inherited) with the person who is best qualified to act as leader getting the position, although the leadership also tends to run in families. The leaders of each neighborhood informally select one of their number to act as the head of the settlement. This position is usually held by the man having the most seniority. Generally speaking, any man from any family can be the leader of a settlement. However, in Mobile County members of the Reed family have been excluded in the past because of their commonly known descent from a Negro slave. The settlement and neighborhood heads are the authorities in each community. They arbitrate disputes, give advice, resolve problems with the schools and churches and lead the religious life of the neighborhoods. Family Life The father was the absolute ruler of his household. His wife and children, until of legal age, were expected to obey him without question. Most women were expected to ask their husbands permission before doing something as simple as visiting a neighbor. The girls were expected to learn household duties at an early age and usually began helping their mothers with daily tasks by age six or so. The girls were strictly disciplined and were expected to obey all instruction given by not only their mothers and fathers but their elder brothers as well. On the other hand, boys were not very strictly disciplined and were given great liberty. Few parents would force a young boy to eat foods he disliked or to attend school and, while they might have been told not to, it was common for boys of eight or ten to smoke, drink and gamble with adults. Most girls were married by the time they were fifteen or sixteen and had had several children by the time they were twenty. Boys usually did not marry until they were twenty-one. One interesting custom peculiar to this group was that of naming patterns. Although the habit initially sounds extremely unusual, when it is considered that there are only a few surnames among these people the pattern makes sense. When a child was born he/she was given a proper name. The child was then called by their first name and by one of their parents or grandparents names. Thus, Joseph whose father was named Edward, would be called ``Joe Ed''. The same pattern occurred at marriage when the wife took on her husband's name. Martha who married Bob would be called ``Martha Bob''. Burial Customs Upon the event of a death, all mirrors in the room in which the body was to be laid out were covered and all clocks were stopped at the time of death. The head of the corpse was bound with a cloth, tied on top of the head or beneath the chin and pennies were placed on the eyes. The body was placed on a ``cooling board'' and the water in which the body was washed was often placed under the board in the belief that it would aid in preservation. All doors in the room in which the body was laid out were left open to allow the spirit of the body to depart unimpeded. A ``wake'' was held the day after the person's death. People began gathering at the home where the body was laid out early in the morning. The children would play in the yard and the adults would gather inside or on the porch of the house. Food and hot coffee were served throughout the day by the female relatives of the deceased. Throughout the day more people would come and about sunset hymns would be sung. Around midnight the crowd would begin to depart and representatives of the family would sit with the body throughout the night. The next day the burial service would take place at the church and the person would be buried in the graveyard. At the end of the service, each person present would pass by the open grave and throw a handful of dirt on top of the coffin. Initially, the idea of a wake for the dead did sound like the Choctaw custom of having a wake. However, when all of the activities involved in the preparation of the body and the wake were examined, not a single element of this event was found to be Choctaw. The wake of the Alabama ``Cajans'' is probably the result of the many Irish and other Europeans which settled in the area in the early nineteenth-century. Many superstitions and cures were encountered among the Alabama ``Cajans''. Virtually all of them are either common in the Southeast today, or are of European origins. summary and conclusions Despite the fairly substantial body of written material available about the Alabama ``Cajans'' and their society and culture and despite the evidence that there are indeed numerous Indian ancestors of this group, their culture in the twentieth century is almost completely derived from that of Europeans. There are only a couple of things mentioned that sound even remotely Indian or Indian-derived and most of these when examined closely are probably not Indian. A couple of the superstitions and folk cures might be derived from the general belief systems of the Southeastern Indians. However, they are so far removed from any actual superstitions practiced by Southeastern Indians that it is impossible at this point to say how they evolved. There is some evidence that some herbal medicine may have survived into the present. However, there are only a couple of slight references to these practices in any of the available material and the evidence is not sufficient to form an opinion. In conclusion, the ``MOWA'' are a portion of the group known for the past century as the Alabama ``Cajans''. This group is a tri-racial isolate who are the descendants of American Indians, including Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek and Apache; African slaves and freemen; and Europeans, including French, English, Spanish, Germans and Russians. Due to their mixed genetic and cultural heritage they were isolated at an early time by pressures from without and within from the surrounding cultures. They have developed a unique and extremely interesting society and culture which blends many of the elements from all of their diverse background. However, they are not an Indian tribe; the are not the remnant of an Indian tribe; they are not Choctaw. comments on some of the testimony presented by the ``mowa'' to support their claims as choctaw In the ``MOWA's'' testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs and in their Application for Recognition presented to the Bureau of Indian Affairs there have been numerous historical errors and misstatements. Most of these have been minor and have been pointed out by other sources. However, several gross errors were presented in the testimony presented before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on June 26, 1991, which can not be ignored or go uncorrected. One of the errors which needs to be corrected involves the location of the Six-Towns District (the Okla Hannali) of the Choctaw Nation and that of Yowani village. Another of the errors is the presumption that the area in which the ``MOWA'' live was covered under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Lastly is the assumption that all documents relative to the Choctaw automatically apply to the ``MOWA''. First, numerous times in the testimony of June 26, the statement is made that Yowani village and the Six Towns District were in Alabama (Tab 4, part 3, page 1; Tab 5, part 1, page 1; Tab 5, part 2, pages 5-6; Tab 7, page 1; as well as many other references to the Six Towns and Yowani which imply but do not say they were in Alabama). This is totally inaccurate. The Six Towns--Yellow Canes, Bouctoulouctsi, Tala, Nachououenya, Senacha and Toussana--where located along Souinlovey Creek and Tarlow Creek, both on the west side of the Chunky River, in northern Jasper and southern Newton counties, Mississippi. Yowani Village, which was not part of the Six Towns, was located on the Chikasawhay River, in the extreme northern portion of Wayne County, Mississippi. Second are the repeated references to the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek and its provisions for private reservations or land grants to Choctaw who did not wish to be removed west. The area in which the ``MOWA'' now live and in which their ancestors have lived for close to the last two hundred years was not covered by Dancing Rabbit Creek. That area was ceded by the Choctaw to the United States under the Treaty of Hoe Buckintoopa in 1803, 27 years before Dancing Rabbit Creek. The area covered under Dancing Rabbit Creek is over 40 miles from the most northern portion of the area occupied by the ``MOWA'', yet they seem to be attempting to make some argument that they are owed something under this treaty. Lastly, throughout all of the testimony and statements made there is a basic underlying assumption that these people are Chocktaw and that this matter does not need to be proven. And therefore, all documents and records which deal with the Choctaw automatically apply to the ``MOWA''. As has been shown in the foregoing discussion, the Alabama ``Cajans'' are not a Chocktaw band or even a remnant thereof. Therefore, none of the documents cited which deal with the Choctaw are relevant. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to amendment.
