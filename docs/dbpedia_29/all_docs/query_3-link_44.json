        "text": "As Old World civilizations built legacies such as Stonehenge and the Parthenon, construction crews were just as busy in the New World—in Louisiana to be precise.\n\nCrews here were American Indians, working with dirt and baskets instead of rocks and cutting tools. People worked countless hours in the valleys of the Mississippi River and other Louisiana waterways, shaping earthen mounds that likely served residential and ceremonial purposes.\n\nPoverty Point World Heritage Site near the town of Epps in northeast Louisiana is the crown jewel of these ancient mound sites. Poverty Point is a network of five mounds—the largest being 70 feet high and 700 feet long—and six concentric semi-elliptical ridges created more than 3,000 years ago. The earthworks were the largest and the most elaborate of their time in North America, and recovered artifacts displayed and interpreted at the site’s museum indicate a large trading network that extended eastward to the Appalachians and northward to the Ohio and Upper Mississippi River valleys.\n\nPoverty Point has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site - joining only about two dozen U.S. sites, including the Statue of Liberty and the Grand Canyon, to have the prestigious designation.\n\nBut Poverty Point is but one of about 700 known Indian mound sites in Louisiana, and many of them are accessible to Louisiana travelers."
