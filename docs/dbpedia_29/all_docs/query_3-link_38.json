        "text": "The Choctaw, Houma, Chitimacha, Biloxi, and other Native peoples have lived on this land since time immemorial. Their identities are inextricably connected to this place. With gratitude and honor, Tulane University pays tribute to the original inhabitants of this land.\n\nThe city of New Orleans was not built upon virgin soil, but merely served as a continuation of a great indigenous trade hub known in Choctaw as Bulbancha, \"the place of other tongues”. For thousands of years, people lived along the Mississippi River, and Bulbancha served as a place for diverse cultures to come together. We acknowledge the grounds of our campus and the city around us as home to numerous tribes before and after the arrival of Europeans.\n\nThe tradition of community and sharing demonstrated by indigenous peoples enabled European immigrants to survive in a foreign environment and has influenced New Orleans and southeastern culture since colonization began. From food and music to art and language, Native Americans continue to leave their mark on our city and academic community.\n\nWe recognize that as a result of broken treaties and involuntary removals, Native Americans were often forced from their lands. We remember and pay respect to the communities impacted by these actions.\n\nYet, the resilient voices of Native Americans are still heard and remain an inseparable part of our local culture. In that spirit we acknowledge the indigenous nations that have lived and continue to thrive here.\n\nAbbreviated Tulane Land Acknowledgment\n\nWe acknowledge and pay tribute to the original inhabitants of this land. The city of New Orleans is a continuation of an indigenous trade hub on the Mississippi River, known for thousands of years as Bulbancha. Native peoples have lived on this land since time immemorial, and the resilient voices of Native Americans remain an inseparable part of our local culture. With gratitude and honor, we acknowledge the indigenous nations that have lived and continue to thrive here.\n\nPronunciation Guide\n\nChoctaw [chaak·taa]\n\nHouma [how·muh]\n\nChitimacha [chi·tee·maa·chuh]\n\nTunica [too·ni·kuh]\n\nBiloxi [buh·luhk·see]\n\nBulbancha [bull-ban-chah]\n\nWhy does Tulane need a Land Acknowledgement?\n\nNative American/First Nations/Indigenous communities and their allies called for a Tulane Land Acknowledgement to be created to recognize the first peoples who inhabited the land that we as Tulanians learn, work, and live on every day. We seek to honor rich history of the Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities who are still stewarding the land we now call “New Orleans” and “Louisiana.” As we honor these communities, we understand that we must look at a complex history of colonization that had impacts on our local, regional, and national Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities. In doing so, we recognize that a land acknowledgment is not an endpoint of this understanding of Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities’ history and respecting these important peoples. Rather, Tulane’s land acknowledgement is an important step in the long journey of ensuring our Native American/First Nations/Indigenous students, staff, faculty, alumni, and community partners experience belonging and thriving within our university community.\n\nHow are land acknowledgements used on campus?\n\nWe suggest you use the land acknowledgment in two ways: (1) when holding a large gathering, read the land acknowledgement to pay respect to past and current Native Americans/First Nations/Indigenous communities where we live, learn, and work and (2) as a beginning to a conversation about how your campus unit understands past and current context at Tulane and in New Orleans and the Gulf Region for Native Americans/First Nations/Indigenous communities.\n\nHow do Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities feel about land acknowledgements?\n\nThis is an important question. Our Indigenous Faculty and Staff Affinity group and students thought that the process of writing Tulane’s land acknowledgement and sharing it on our website and at our large gatherings was important to send a clear message to Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities on and off campus that Tulane values them. We are grateful for the people who worked closely with Tulane calling for this.\n\nDo other universities have land acknowledgements?\n\nYes. We join universities within the Association of American Universities and across the nation who have land acknowledgements. You can take a look at a few of our peer and aspirant universities at these links: Harvard University, Stanford University, Cornell University, Columbia University, Yale University, and Vanderbilt University.\n\nAs a Tulanian, how can I use the land acknowledgement in a respectful way? How can I support community-building for Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities on and off campus?\n\nWe love this question! At the university level, we have the land acknowledgement on our website, and we share it at the beginning of large gatherings, such as commencement. Whether you are in an event focusing on students, faculty, staff, alumni, and/or community partners, you can share the land acknowledgement at the beginning of large and small events. It is important that we demonstrate respect as we read the land acknowledgement and strive to use correct pronunciation (see the Pronunciation Guide above) as we read the land acknowledgement, and to understand that the land acknowledgement is just one – albeit very important – aspect of supporting Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities.\n\nTake some time in your unit to ask the following questions so your use of the land acknowledgement is connected to meaningful work you are doing within your campus unit and with your colleagues:\n\nWhat specific knowledge do you have about the needs of Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities at Tulane?\n\nWhat resources can help you increase your efforts to support Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities at Tulane?\n\nWhat feedback have you received from Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities at Tulane about areas of need and improvement needed? What actions have you taken to address these needs?\n\nWhere can I find more information on Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities in the land we now call “New Orleans,” “Louisiana,” the “Gulf Region,” and around the world?\n\nThere are multiple resources you can explore at the following links. Each year, we plan to update and expand accessibility to these resources, as well as support meaningful and equitable collaborations with our local, state, regional, national, and global Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities.\n\nTulane Resources\n\nTulane Indigenous Faculty and Staff Affinity Group\n\nTulane Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nTulane Office of Multicultural Affairs\n\nNew Orleans Resources\n\nThe Native Roots of the French Market\n\nRemembering Bulbancha\n\nRevising Indigenous Histories with Bulbancha is Still a Place\n\nTriPod: New Orleans at 300\n\nLouisiana Resources\n\nAmerican Indians in Louisiana\n\nIndigenous Tribes of New Orleans and Louisiana\n\nLouisiana’s Native American Heritage\n\nOffice of Indian Affairs, Louisiana Office of the Governor\n\nTunica Language Project\n\nNational Resources\n\nCollege Horizons – First Nations/Indigenous/Native American Scholarship Resources\n\nMap of Indigenous Nations – Learn about the Land Where You Live and Learn\n\nWinds of Change – Advancing Indigenous People in STEM\n\nUS Department of Arts and Culture – Learn More about Land Acknowledgements\n\nGlobal Resources\n\nInternational Work Group for International Affairs\n\nGlobal Indigenous Council: Rights of Indigenous Peoples\n\nIndigenous Peoples: Amnesty International\n\nIndigenous Peoples at the United Nations\n\nWho wrote Tulane’s land acknowledgement?\n\nTulane’s land acknowledgement was developed in consultation with Colleen Billiot and John Barbry, members of the United Houma and Tunica-Biloxi Nations respectively. Colleen and John worked closely with the Office of the President and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion to discuss the purpose of the land acknowledgement, as well as to discuss ways to honor our Native American/First Nations/Indigenous communities at Tulane and in New Orleans in meaningful ways."
