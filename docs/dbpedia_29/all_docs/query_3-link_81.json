        "text": "The following information provides guidance to selected parties who need to consult with American Indian tribes. While the Texas Historical Commission provides these guidelines to help facilitate consultations, responsibility for consultation rests on federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as other organizations with consultation requirements.\n\nConsultation Basics\n\nWhy Should I Consult with Indian Tribes?\n\nConsultation with Indian tribes is specifically required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (U.S. Code 16, §470, et seq.) and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) (U.S. Code 25, §3001, et seq.), and it is encouraged for compliance with the Texas Health and Safety Code (Title 8, Chapters 711–714). Federal law and policy requires federal entities to consult with Indian tribes if a project or activity they are involved in has the potential to cause adverse effects on Native American historic and cultural resources, including, but not limited to, archeological sites, traditional and sacred sites, and artifacts. Federal agencies may delegate consultation responsibility to state agencies, local governments, and other organizations, but only if the tribe accepts or requests the delegation and if an undertaking occurs on public lands; if the project receives federal funding, permits, or licenses; or if the project has other direct or indirect federal involvement and the activity has a potential adverse effect on Native American historic and cultural resources.\n\nWhat Is Tribal Consultation?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation Programs, consultation is \"the process of seeking, discussing, and considering the views of others, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them on how historic properties should be identified, considered, and managed.\" 1 Consultation is the development of a trust relationship, an effort to understand and consider any effects an undertaking may have on the consulting parties. Consulting parties may include federal agency officials; local government representatives, including, but not limited to, sheriffs, police officers, medical examiners, city and town officials, and others; applicants for federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals; representatives from a federally recognized Indian tribe; the State Historic Preservation Officer; the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer; and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.\n\nConsultation is usually more than a letter notifying a tribe about an undertaking, a \"legal notice\" in the local newspaper, or any other form of unilateral communication. Consultation involves open and candid dialogue among all the consulting parties. The participants work toward resolving the effects of the undertaking so that cultural resources are preserved and tribal sovereignty rights are respected.\n\nWhy Is Tribal Consultation Important?\n\nTribal consultation is a legal requirement designed to protect Native American historic and cultural resources. The goal of consultation is to identify and address any concerns from modern descendants about potential effects to places of cultural and historical significance such as an archeological site or a traditional cultural property. Engaging in open and candid dialogue is an effective way to obtain such information. Ultimately, this bilateral communication helps everyone gain a better understanding of the resources that contribute to our state's rich heritage.\n\nThe following information provides guidance to selected parties who need to consult with American Indian tribes. While the Texas Historical Commission provides these guidelines to help facilitate consultations, responsibility for consultation rests on federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as other organizations with consultation requirements.\n\nSection 106\n\nIf a project involves federal funds, permits, licenses, or lands and it has a potential effect on Native American historic or cultural resources, you may be required to conduct consultation with Indian tribes as stipulated in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (U.S. Code 16, §470, et seq.).\n\nThere are a number of ways that Section 106 regulations could apply during the course of a project. As a rule of thumb, plan Section 106 compliance activities any time there is federal involvement.\n\nConsultation may be necessary if the project encounters, alters, or has an adverse effect on Native American historical and cultural resources, which include, but are not limited to, human remains, funerary objects, historic structures, sacred sites, and traditional cultural properties. Here are a few example projects where consultation may be necessary under Section 106:\n\nProject requires a Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for work that will result in the discharge of fill material in a navigable river.\n\nProject receives a Community Block Development Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nProject receives federal funding for utility work, including, but not limited to, sewer, telephone, and electrical lines.\n\nMore information about the Section 106 process can be found on the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation website.\n\nNAGPRA\n\nThe Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) (U.S. Code 25 §3001, et seq.) includes provisions for intentional and inadvertent discoveries of Native American cultural items on federal and tribal lands. Cultural items include, but are not limited to, Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and items of cultural patrimony.\n\nIf authorities take possession of human remains and later it is determined that they are not part of a crime scene, then NAGPRA may still apply.\n\nSee NAGPRA Flowchart for more information.\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code\n\nDiscovery of human remains may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Title 8, Chapters 711–714). Though consultation with Indian tribes is not legally required under the Health and Safety Code, the Texas Historical Commission (THC) encourages consultation in the event of intentional or inadvertent discoveries of human remains and funerary objects to ensure that these items are dealt with properly and respectfully.\n\nSee Texas Health and Safety Code Flowchart for more information.\n\nFor more information on reporting unknown or abandoned cemeteries, see Notice of Existence of Cemetery on the THC website.\n\nFederal Laws, Regulations, Executive Documents, and Court Decisions\n\nConsultation is grounded in the government-to-government relationship established by the U.S. Constitution, treaties, statutes, case law, and policy. The federal government has a trust responsibility to protect tribal sovereignty, self-determination, assets and resources, and treaty and other reserved rights. Executive orders published by current and past presidents reaffirm this responsibility and the need for consultation at the government-to-government level.\n\nNational Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Public Law 89-665; U.S. Code 16, §470, et seq.) The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) is the predominant preservation legislation in the United States. Section 106 of the NHPA directs federal agencies and recipients of federal funds, permits, and licenses as well as those working on federal lands to take into account the effects of an undertaking on historic properties. The implementing regulations of Section 106 can be found in Title 36, Part 800 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (Public Law 91-190; U.S. Code 42, §4321) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the effects of their proposed actions on the natural and physical environment. Specifically, for major federal actions that have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment, NEPA directs agencies to produce Environmental Impact Statements and provide detailed explanations regarding any adverse effects, possible alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between the short-term use of an area and its long-term maintenance and productivity, and any irreversible or irretrievable commitments on resources.\n\nIndian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (1975) (Public Law 93-368; U.S. Code 25, §450) The Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) gives tribes the opportunity to plan, conduct, and administer certain federal programs and services for their communities. These include health care, education, housing, infrastructure, and government administration. The ISDEAA allows tribes to enter into contracts with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior regarding the management of these programs and makes grants available to tribes to facilitate these programs and services.\n\nAmerican Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) (Public Law 95-341; U.S. Code 42, §1996) The American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) protects and preserves the traditional religions and belief systems of American Indians. AIRFA directs federal agencies to work with Indian tribes on policy and procedures to achieve this goal. AIRFA provisions cover access to sacred sites, the use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom of American Indians to practice traditional ceremonies and rites.\n\nArchaeological Resources Protection Act (1979) (Public Law 96-95; U.S. Code 16, §470aa-mm) The Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) protects archeological resources on federal public lands. It establishes penalties for the removal of, damage to, sale, purchase, exchange, or transport of archeological resources recovered from federal lands. ARPA also gives federal land managers authority to issue permits for archeological studies on Indian tribal and federal public lands.\n\nNative American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) (Public Law 101-601; U.S. Code 25, §3001, et seq.) The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) defines a process for the return of Native American human remains and cultural items such as funerary and sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony that are in the possession of museums and other institutions. NAGPRA also specifies provisions for the discovery of Native American human remains and cultural items on federal and tribal lands and establishes penalties for non-compliance and trafficking of these items. All public and private museums and institutions that receive federal funding must comply with NAGPRA.\n\nPresidential Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations (1994) President Clinton's 1994 memorandum on government-to-government consultation outlines principles that executive departments and agencies must follow in their interactions with Native American tribal governments.\n\nPueblo of Sandia v. United States, 50 F.3d 856 (10th Cir. 1995) The court, in Pueblo of Sandia v. United States, found that federal agency officials did not make a \"reasonable and good faith effort\" to identify and evaluate the effects of an undertaking on traditional cultural properties. This ruling set a precedent for the use of \"reasonable\" and \"good faith\" as criterions to evaluate an agency's level of effort.\n\nExecutive Order No. 13007, Indian Sacred Sites (1996) Executive Order No. 13007 requires federal agencies to consult with Indian tribes concerning the access, use, and protection of sacred sites.\n\nExecutive Order No. 13175, Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments (2000) Executive Order No. 13175 directs federal agencies to develop an \"accountable process\" of conducting consultation with Indian tribes that respects Indian tribal self-government and sovereignty, honors tribal treaty and other rights, and strives to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the federal government and Indian tribal governments.\n\nPresident Obama's 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation directs agency officials to provide detailed plans of action regarding the implementation of directives in Executive Order No. 13175.\n\nPresident Biden's 2021 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation to Nation Relationships 2021\n\nTexas Laws and Regulations\n\nAntiquities Code of Texas (1969), as amended (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) The Antiquities Code is the governing body of regulations relating to the protection and preservation of all sites, objects, buildings, shipwrecks, and locations of historical, archeological, educational, or scientific interest within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas. It requires state agencies and political subdivisions of the state, including, but not limited to, cities, counties, river authorities, municipal utility districts, and school districts, to notify the Texas Historical Commission (THC) of any action on public land that has the potential to disturb recorded historic or archeological sites. The THC issues antiquities permits that authorize archeological studies and work proposed at designated locations.\n\nTexas Health and Safety Code (1989), Provisions Relating to Cemeteries (Health and Safety Code, Title 8, Chapters 711–714) Section 711 of the Texas Health and Safety Code lists definitions and regulations regarding the establishment, maintenance, and disturbance of cemeteries, human remains, and funerary objects on public and private lands within the State of Texas. In 2009, amendments to the Texas Health and Safety Code clarified that legal protection extended to interments of any age or cultural affiliation.\n\nConsultation is grounded in the government-to-government relationship established by the U.S. Constitution, treaties, statutes, case law, and policy. The federal government has a trust responsibility to protect tribal sovereignty, self-determination, assets and resources, and treaty and other reserved rights. Executive orders published by current and past presidents reaffirm this responsibility and the need for consultation at the government-to-government level.\n\nNational Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Public Law 89-665; U.S. Code 16, §470, et seq.)

These include health care, education, housing, infrastructure, and government administration. The ISDEAA allows tribes to enter into contracts with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior regarding the management of these programs and makes grants available to tribes to facilitate these programs and services.\n\nAmerican Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) (Public Law 95-341; U.S. Code 42, §1996) The American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) protects and preserves the traditional religions and belief systems of American Indians.

While the Texas Historical Commission provides these guidelines to help facilitate consultations, responsibility for consultation rests on federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as other organizations with consultation requirements.\n\nTips for Tribal Consultation\n\nTalk early and often. Failure to consult with the appropriate parties may result in significant project delays.\n\nGet informed and stay informed. Brief yourself or your representatives on tribal histories and contemporary issues. Many tribes provide brief histories on their websites.\n\nDocument your efforts from the planning stages through final meetings.\n\nConsider appointing a special liaison or point of contact if you will regularly consult with Indian tribes. This will help streamline the process for all consulting parties.\n\nRecognize, respect, and encourage cultural differences. Native American concepts of how and when meetings should occur may differ from those in mainstream business practice.\n\nBe honest. Don’t make promises that you or your agency/sponsor cannot keep.\n\nAllow adequate time for participant groups to consider the project and its implications. Consultation is a process. It is not a single meeting.\n\nPay attention to word choices. For example, the term “prehistoric” may be offensive to native peoples as it implies that tribes had no “history” prior to contact with Europeans.\n\nShare a meal or plan a social outing. Don’t restrict your time to just business; engage and learn from native participants to get a better understanding of their perceptions of the matters at hand.\n\nConsider bringing gifts. Check with your agency/sponsor and applicable state and federal laws to determine what is appropriate.\n\nAsk permission from tribal representatives if you plan to take photographs.\n\nBe aware of tribal political changes. Tribal governments, like our national and state government, have periodic leadership changes.\n\nBrief History of Tribal Sovereignty\n\nThis brief history provides basic background information on the regulatory interactions between American Indian tribes and Euro-American settlers. It is not exhaustive.\n\nColonial Era (1533–1775): During this period, treaty-making was the primary form of negotiation with Indian tribes, who were afforded a similar status as colonial governments. Treaties sought to end hostilities, establish the boundaries of Indian lands, and regulate trade.\n\nU.S. Federal Era (1776–1823): Treaty-making continued in this period. Laws of the new nation regulated interaction between Indian and non-Indian peoples, especially concerning trade and land transactions (e.g., Trade and Non-Intercourse Act of 1790). Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gave power to the Congress to \"regulate Commerce with . . . the Indian Tribes.\"\n\nRemoval Era (1823–1871): The beginning of this period is characterized by Chief Justice John Marshall's opinions, which set the precedent that Indian tribes were \"domestic dependent nations\" and that only the federal government had authority over these nations. Another significant enactment, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, stipulated the removal of a number of Indian groups to western reservations. The end of this period is marked by the Appropriations Act of 1871, which ended U.S. treaty-making with Indian tribes.\n\nAssimilation Era (1871–1934): This period is characterized by policies aiming to integrate Indian peoples into mainstream American society. The General Allotment/Dawes Act of 1887, which divided reservation lands into individual parcels, encouraged independent land holding and agriculture. \"Surplus\" lands were sold to non-Indians. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 conferred citizenship on Indian people who had not already gained that status through service in the armed forces, assimilation, or other methods.\n\nReorganization Era (1934–1953): In 1934, the Wheeler-Howard/Indian Reorganization Act sought to restore some vestiges of tribal sovereignty lost during the Assimilation Era. Tribes were encouraged to establish formal governments and constitutions.\n\nTermination Era (1953–1968): House Concurrent Resolution 108 reversed federal policy of tribal self-governance and abolished more than 50 tribal governments. This period also is characterized by federally funded programs to move individuals from the reservation to major cities.\n\nSelf-Determination Era (1968–Present): Stirring of Indian consciousness following the Termination Era led to a dramatic increase in Native American advocacy for self-governance. In 1978, the Bureau of Indian Affairs established the modern Federal Acknowledgment Process. As of April 12, 2011, 565 tribes had been federally recognized.\n\nGlossary\n\nAgency: An administrative unit of government receiving federal or state support.\n\nConsultation: The process of requesting, discussing, and considering the opinion of others, and when possible, seeking agreement on the management and identification of historic properties. Several laws require agencies to consult with federally recognized Indian tribes if a project will have an effect on tribal historical or cultural resources. This requirement applies to all tribes with historic ties to an area, not just those with reservations within current boundaries of the state.\n\nFederally Recognized Indian Tribe: An Indian tribe, nation, or other organized group or community recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Interior as eligible for certain federal government services and benefits. A list of federally recognized tribes is published annually in the Federal Register.\n\nGovernment-to-Government: The nature of the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribal governments, acknowledging tribal sovereignty and rights of self-governance.\n\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA): An agreement document that records specific terms and conditions to resolve known adverse effects on historic properties.\n\nMuseum (for NAGPRA purposes): \"[A]ny institution or state or local government agency (including institutions of higher learning) that receives federal funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items.\" 1\n\nPublic Land: Any lands owned or administered by the federal or state government, including political subdivisions of a state such as cities, towns, and counties.\n\nProgrammatic Agreement (PA): An agreement document that records specific terms and conditions to streamline or improve the standard 106 process for an agency program.\n\nRepatriation: The process through which American Indian cultural items, including human remains, funerary objects, and sacred objects, are returned to lineal descendants or culturally affiliated Indian tribes.\n\nTraditional Cultural Property (TCP): Places that derive significance from their association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community.\n\nTribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO): A designated tribal official who has undertaken some or all of the responsibilities of the State Historic Preservation Officer on tribal land. THPOs also may develop and implement historic preservation plans, coordinate repatriation efforts, develop cultural/heritage tourism and educational outreach programs, and direct other preservation activities.\n\nTrust Relationship: The fiduciary responsibilities of the federal government to protect tribal sovereignty, self-determination, assets and resources, and treaty and other reserved rights.\n\nUndertaking: \"A project, activity, or program funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency, including those carried out by or on behalf of a federal agency; those carried out with federal financial assistance; and those requiring a federal permit, license or approval.\"\n\nThe following information provides guidance to selected parties who need to consult with American Indian tribes. While the Texas Historical Commission provides these guidelines to help facilitate consultations, responsibility for consultation rests on federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as other organizations with consultation requirements.\n\nDetermining Tribal Contacts\n\nFederal law and policy requires consultation to occur with Indian tribes that have been federally recognized. Federally-Recognized Indian Tribes are those that have been formally acknowledged by the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Office of Federal Acknowledgment, the U.S. Congress, or a federal court as descendants of an historical Native American tribe. Federally-Recognized Indian Tribes have rights of self-governance and are eligible to receive services and participate in programs offered by the federal government. Federal agencies and those to whom they delegate their responsibilities for consultation are not required to consult with non-federally recognized groups; however, these groups may have valuable insight that pertains to specific projects. Non-federally recognized groups have a legal right to comment on projects as \"interested parties.\"\n\nCurrently, Texas has three tribal communities living within state boundaries and at least 26 other communities with ties to Texas. Depending on the scope and nature of your project, you may have to consult with multiple tribes.\n\nTo determine the tribes with which you should consult:\n\nRefer to tribal Area of Interest Maps.\n\nConsult the National Park Service (NPS) NAGPRA database or tribal websites for contact information.\n\nContact the Southern Plains Regional Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nBrowse local historical and archival documents for references to Indian tribes that have inhabited the project area.\n\nMany tribes have appointed Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs) or other representatives to oversee preservation efforts on tribal and ancestral lands and coordinate repatriation programs. The National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers maintains a list of THPOs recognized by the NPS as having assumed the duties of State Historic Preservation Officers on tribal lands.\n\nIf a tribe has a designated THPO or point of contact for historic preservation activities, contact that individual about the project first.\n\nAdditionally, contact the tribe's elected executive officials, such as a tribal council chairperson, governor, or president.\n\nArea of Interest\n\nOf the 29 Federally-Recognized Tribes that maintain a connection to the State of Texas, only three are located in the state. Please be aware that tribal interest areas may change as new discoveries provide information about historic tribal territories. Below is a list of tribes with known interests in Texas. (Refer to Tribal Contacts List)\n\nAbsentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma\n\nAlabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas\n\nAlabama-Quassarte Tribal Town\n\nApache Tribe of Oklahoma\n\nCaddo Nation\n\nCherokee Nation\n\nCheyenne & Arapaho Tribes\n\nChoctaw Nation\n\nComanche Nation\n\nCoushatta Tribe of Louisiana\n\nDelaware Nation\n\nJena Band of Choctaw Indians\n\nJicarilla Apache Nation\n\nKialegee Tribal Town\n\nKickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas\n\nKickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma\n\nKiowa Tribe of Oklahoma\n\nMescalero Apache Tribe\n\nMuscogee (Creek) Nation\n\nOsage Nation\n\nQuapaw Tribe\n\nSeminole Nation of Oklahoma\n\nShawnee Tribe\n\nThlopthlocco Tribal Town\n\nTonkawa Tribe\n\nTunica-Biloxi Tribe\n\nUnited Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians\n\nWichita and Affiliated Tribes\n\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo\n\nThe following information provides guidance to selected parties who need to consult with American Indian tribes. While the Texas Historical Commission provides these guidelines to help facilitate consultations, responsibility for consultation rests on federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as other organizations with consultation requirements.\n\nQ: How do I know if I have to consult with Indian tribes?\n\nA: Whether or not you have to consult with Indian tribes depends on which laws, if any, apply to your project (see next question below). If your project or activity occurs on federal, state, tribal, or public lands, or if it requires funding, licensing, permitting, or other involvement by the federal government, and if your project may have an adverse effect on Native American cultural or historic resources, you may have to consult with Indian tribes. Additionally, if you are an institution that receives federal funding and is in possession of Native American human remains or cultural items, you may have to consult with Indian tribes in order to comply with NAGPRA regulations.\n\nQ: How do I know which laws apply to my project?\n\nA: Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act applies to federal or federally assisted undertakings on federal, state, tribal, public, and private lands where an undertaking has the potential to have an effect on historic properties. This includes, but is not limited to, districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects.\n\nThe Antiquities Code of Texas and the Texas Health and Safety Code apply to projects occurring on non-federal lands in Texas. A project may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas if it will have an effect on a State Antiquities Landmark. If you discover human remains on non-federal lands, you may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Texas Health and Safety Code.\n\nNAGPRA applies to intentional or inadvertent discoveries of Native American human remains and cultural items on federal or tribal lands. NAGPRA also applies to federally funded institutions such as museums and universities that are in possession of Native American human remains and cultural items. If a federally funded institution takes possession of Native American human remains or cultural items, it becomes subject to NAGPRA regulations.\n\nQ: How do I know if I am a museum for NAGPRA purposes?\n\nA: Any institution, including state or local government agencies and institutions of higher learning, that receives federal funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items falls under the jurisdiction of NAGPRA.\n\nQ: I am a private landowner and have discovered a site on my property. Do I need to consult with Indian tribes?\n\nA: There is no legal requirement for consultation with Indian tribes for discoveries on privately-owned lands in Texas; however, you may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Texas Health and Safety Code if human remains are found on your property.\n\nQ: What are my responsibilities for consultation?\n\nA: You must make a reasonable and good-faith effort to take into account the adverse effects of your project upon Native American cultural or historic resources. Depending on the applicable laws and nature of your project, you have a limited time frame to notify Indian tribes and other consulting parties about discoveries or any adverse effects.\n\nQ: Do I have to consult with Indian groups that are not federally recognized?\n\nA: There is no legal requirement to consult with Indian groups or tribes that are not recognized by the federal government; however, non-federally recognized tribal groups may comment on a project or undertaking as an \"interested party.\"\n\nQ: Who do I contact within a tribe about consultation?\n\nA: If the tribe has a Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) or other representative appointed to oversee preservation activities, this should be your first point of contact. If the tribe does not have a THPO or point of contact for historic preservation activities, you should contact tribal executives or leaders such as a tribal council chairperson, president, or traditional religious leader.\n\nQ: Should I contact tribes only when an effect will occur on significant sites?\n\nA: A site's significance is subjective; what one person may consider insignificant may have special meaning or importance to another person. While it is best to initiate consultation for all sites and properties that may potentially suffer adverse effects by a project, some tribes have identified specific types of projects or resources for which they do not need to be consulted. It is only through consultations with Indian tribes that you can determine what projects require consultation, which tribes need to be consulted, and what potential effects this project will have on historic and/or cultural resources.\n\nQ: Can I have an archeological/environmental contractor conduct the consultation meetings?\n\nA: While archeological/environmental contractors should not conduct consultation meetings, they can help to organize them. Consultations should be conducted on a government-to-government basis (i.e., between a federal agency official and a tribal government official); however, federal agencies may delegate their legal responsibilities for consultation to state, local, or tribal officials. The level of authority required for consultation acknowledges tribal sovereignty as well as a unique legal status as an Indian tribe.\n\nQ: Who pays for travel involved with consultations?\n\nA: Although there is no requirement to travel to conduct consultation meetings, the consultation process can be more efficient if agencies or organizations travel to meet with Indian tribes. Tribal representatives should never be expected to pay to attend consultation meetings. Many tribal groups do not have the time or resources to travel for consultation meetings; however, this should not be interpreted as a lack of interest.\n\nQ: When is consultation complete?\n\nA: Consultation is an ongoing process. Rarely are all concerns addressed in one meeting. There are no legal stipulations regarding the duration of consultation meetings, but consulting parties are expected to engage in open and candid dialogue about the project, its effects, and possible alternatives and resolutions.\n\nQ: What if we cannot come to an agreement during consultation meetings?\n\nA: If consultation meetings with Indian tribes reach an impasse during the Section 106 process, the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP) can be consulted. For issues regarding NAGPRA, contact David Tarler, Designated Federal Officer for the NAGPRA Review Committee.\n\nQ: What if I have additional questions?\n\nA: The ACHP maintains a Working with Section 106 section on the agency's website that offers valuable information and guidance on that process. Questions related to the NAGPRA should be directed to the National NAGPRA Program. If you receive funding, permits, or licenses from a federal agency and would like more information about its policies and procedures regarding Native American consultation, see Additional Resources below, which includes a list of federal agency and other websites related to tribal and cultural resource policies. Many agencies have points of contact for historic preservation-related issues. Finally, any questions related to the Antiquities Code of Texas or the Texas Health and Safety Code should be directed to the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Consultation-specific inquiries should be directed to Archeology Division at the THC."
