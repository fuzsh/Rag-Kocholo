        "text": "Humans have inhabited North America since the conclusion of the last ice age. It is estimated that people moved to what is now Arkansas in the year 11,650 BC. These original inhabitants are referred to as Paleoindian peoples in the field of archeology. The evidence suggests that they settled in Arkansas as groups of less than 50 individuals. They fashioned primitive hunting tools using chert, a hard rock that can be broken into very sharp pieces.\n\nAs the environment warmed after the ice age, more diverse species of plants and animals thrived in the area. In this environment, people lived in more sizable groups, consumed plants and nuts, and hunted deer and elk. As time passed, they utilized pottery in their food preparation and storage and bows and arrows for hunting.\n\nThe Native Americans that originally lived in Arkansas were of the Caddo, Chickasaw, Osage, Quapaw, and Tunica tribes. In an Arkansas Indian tribes map, it is apparent that the Osage, Caddo, and Quapaw inhabited the majority of the land. The Osage utilized the northwest portion of Arkansas for hunting, while the Caddo inhabited the southern portion. The Quapaw's territory made up the eastern part of the state. The Tunica tribe inhabited a small area in the southeast corner, while the Chickasaw tribe inhabited a small area in the northeast portion of the state.\n\nPrior to European contact, the Native Peoples of Arkansas inhabited various regions of Arkansas. The available information about their arrival and lifestyle is garnered in part from Native American oral traditions, archeological evidence, and explorers' documents.\n\nEvidence indicates that the Caddo tribe migrated to Arkansas between the years 700 and 800. The Caddo traveled along the riverways and eventually settled in the region, inhabiting the same area for hundreds of years. They spoke a unique language, called the Caddo language, that was unlike any other that Spanish explorers encountered in the area in the 16th century. The Caddo language has a number of dialects, and two of the most common are the Hasinai and the Hainai.\n\nThe Quapaw and Osage were two Siouan-speaking tribes that lived in Arkansas. According to Quapaw oral tradition, the tribe arrived in the Arkansas River Valley between the mid-16th century and 1673. Archeological information from the area indicates the tribe may have descended from the Pacaha and Casqui peoples, who lived in Arkansas in the 1500s. The Osage entered the northwest area of Arkansas in the 1700s and had a somewhat nomadic culture.\n\nThe Choctaw tribe moved to regions west of the Mississippi River in the early 1700s and joined forces with the Americans to win the War of 1812. Historical evidence suggests that this tribe inhabited land south of the Arkansas River in the 1810s but did not control a large portion of land in Arkansas.\n\nHernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer who arrived east of the Mississippi River in the year 1541. He and his men encountered Native Americans in May of that year and found a very productive agricultural community and an organized system of roads and housing. In Arkansas, de Soto's team found villages centered around structures used for ceremonies. In documents from their explorations, it is evident that they encountered the Tunica and Caddo tribes. Other tribes are included in the documents, but their names do not correspond to tribes described at any other time, making the information unclear. The Spaniards explored Arkansas for in excess of two years and brought devastation to the tribes. They demanded food from, enslaved and killed many Native Americans. They also wrecked village communities and farmland.\n\nThe next documentation of Arkansas was written more than one hundred years after de Soto's explorers had left Arkansas when explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet entered the area. As they traveled along the Mississippi River, they found more compact villages than those found by de Soto, evidence that the Spanish exploration had a dramatic impact.\n\nIn the 1700s, English, French, and Spanish colonists in the Arkansas region encountered the Quapaw, Caddo, and Osage tribes. French colonists stayed in Arkansas and developed a trading and bartering system with the Native American communities. Examples of goods that were traded included horses, meat, tallow, ammunition, clothing, and sundries. The Osage established a strong system of trade with the Europeans and provided them with information, resulting in their command of more land. The Quapaws had an established trading relationship with the French, where they traded fur and other animal products.\n\nClose contact between Native American communities and European communities exposed them to new diseases. The Quapaw population steeply declined due to smallpox, other diseases, and conflicts with other tribes. Between the late 1600s and 1700s, the number of Quapaws was estimated to be between 3500 and 7500. By the 19th century, the Quapaw population was 555.\n\nNative Peoples in Arkansas Today\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century, many people of various backgrounds had traveled east to live in Arkansas. These groups included people of French, African, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Anglo-American heritage. The Arkansas Post, a European institution that centralized government, defense, and bartering operations, drew many people to the area. At this time, many people engaged in hunting and trading to sustain themselves.\n\nDuring the 19th century, many Native American tribes were removed from Arkansas. The United States President, Andrew Jackson, signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The Act approved the removal of Native Americans from their land in exchange for land west of the Mississippi River. By the year 1840, thousands of Native Americans had been removed from their lands. The Trail of Tears describes the paths that Native Americans took away from their land to reach their new locations. Made up of a network of over 5,000 miles, several of the routes cross through Arkansas.\n\nMap of the Trail of Tears\n\nEach tribe that lived in Arkansas before encountering new groups had a unique series of events that led them away from their native land. The Osage tribe was removed from their land in the early 1800s. They were relocated to the eastern portion of Oklahoma. The Osage experienced a lack of resources, and many aspects of their culture faded. Later, the Osage found oil deposits in their Oklahoma lands. Currently, the Osage Nation is in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1818, the Quapaw signed a treaty to move their residence from the southern portion of Arkansas to the west in exchange for $4000 worth of goods and $1000 worth of goods yearly. In 1824, the Quapaw signed another treaty to surrender their newly acquired land to the United States. They moved to land led by the Caddo tribe, returned to Arkansas by 1830, and continued to move before establishing headquarters in Quapaw, Oklahoma.\n\nThe Chickasaw tribe was removed from their land through the signing of a treaty in 1832. They did not leave until 1837 and went west to the Indian Territory. The current headquarters of the Chickasaw Nation is in Ada, Oklahoma, and is made up of over 40,000 members. The Caddo tribe lost their land in Arkansas in 1835. The tribe was forced to sign a treaty to give up their land and traveled a long distance to Caddo County, Oklahoma.\n\nAt present, there are no Native American tribes with federal recognition in Arkansas. After the events of the 1800s, the tribe's headquarters were established in other states.\n\nArrival of Native Americans in Arkansas\n\nNative Americans first arrived in what we now call Arkansas, around the year 11,650 BCE. These first people who arrived were called Paleoindians, denoting that they originated in the Paleolithic Era of the Stone Age.\n\nAs the Ice Age came to a close around 7000 BCE, Paleoindians formed more advanced civilizations that used better stone tools and created the large mounds, that native tribes known as the Mississippians, are remembered for today. By 650 CE, native tribes in Arkansas had not only perfected farming and animal domestication, they also had advanced to the point of creating a semi-calendar system with their mounds, using their knowledge of astronomy.\n\nFor the next 900 years, these tribes competed with each other for trade and dominance but kept close contact through their commercial ties. They established more mound communities through the 1000s CE. In the 1530s, when the Spanish arrived in the Arkansas area, they were met by advanced civilizations that at first intended to trade and impress their European visitors.\n\nEuropeans in Arkansas\n\nThe Spanish brought with them the horrors of disease and enslavement as they sought conquest of the New World. Powerful leaders who had established tribes like the Caddos, the Osage, and the Quapaws, all fell under the rule and the domain of the Spanish, led by conquistador Hernando de Soto.\n\nBy the time de Soto died in present-day Arkansas in 1542 CE, the Spanish had completed their trek through the area conquering the native tribes they met. For the next century and a half, the Spanish held sway over the native population, and diseases, like measles, decimated whole populations.\n\nOther tribes native to Arkansas suffered the same fates as their counterparts. The Chickasaw were relocated to Indian Territory in Oklahoma and the Tunica and Koroa tribe banded together and moved further into Louisiana.\n\nWhen the French explorers entered Arkansas, seeking a fur trade route from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico in the 1640s, tribes like the Quapaws and the Caddo attempted to trade with them with them as well but, contracted smallpox in return.\n\nThe Caddos\n\nBetween the Red and Ouachita rivers lived the Caddo tribe. The Caddo established farming communities which were littered with dome-shaped homes with large plots for farming. The Caddo were a large tribe who had a loose alliance with other tribes of Caddo, located in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nTheir social structure was divided into gender roles. Women wove some clothing and made others with animal hides, cared for children, and did most of the cooking. Men among the Caddo performed religious rituals and hunted. Religious leaders were called 'xinesi' and tribal leaders were called 'cadi'. Both men and women constructed homes and farmed.\n\nPicture of Caddo Village in Oklahoma\n\nTattooing was a major characteristic of the Caddo for men and women, and their pottery was also a source of distinction with remnants found today showing intricate displays of scenes from their daily life. Smoking peace pipes called 'calumets' using locally grown tobacco was another feature of the tribe, which was shared with other peoples in the area.\n\nDuring the 1500s and the 1600s, the Spanish and French laid waste to the Caddo tribe and its territories, forcing their relocation to Texas along the Brazos River.\n\nThe Quapaws\n\nThe Quapaws were a unique tribe located on the east and west sides of the Mississippi River. When the French encountered the Quapaw tribe they applied a French pronunciation (Arcansas) to the Quapaw tribe's original name 'akakaze', which means ''downriver people.'' Hence, the name Arkansas was born. Each family clan of the Quapaw tribe was organized within their religion as either Sky People or Earth People.\n\nSky People were entrusted with religious rituals that governed the spiritual lives of the Quapaw, and Earth People performed rituals that focused on the wealth of each family, and the tribe itself. Men and women performed similar gender roles as the Caddo, with women doing most of the cooking and men doing the hunting and fighting.\n\nDepiction of Quapaw War Scene\n\nThe Quapaw were a farming and hunting tribe that subsisted on maize (corn), beans, and gourd-based plants like squash. They also grew tobacco that was smoked by tribesmen for recreation and religious ceremonies. Local buffalo and deer were also a part of the Quapaw diet and lifestyle and used for food (meat), tools and weapons (bones), and clothing (hides).\n\nThe French set up a fur trading post in the Quapaw community of Osotouy in 1686. By the 1700s the Quapaw population dropped from 5,000 to under 2,000. By the 1800s, there were only some 500 Quapaws left.\n\nThe Osage\n\nThe Osage were native to Missouri and northern Arkansas. Their religion was that of the Quapaws, with familial clans separated into groups of Sky People and Earth People. The mohawk hairstyle was a characteristic of Osage men, who hunted primarily during the summer in their vast territories. Women did traditional roles like farming and caring for the home.\n\nOsage Chiefs"
