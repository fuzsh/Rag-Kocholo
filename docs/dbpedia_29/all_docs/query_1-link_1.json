Tho mpson on March 14, 1934. No independent verification is yet known. He is a lso most likely the same person as Atahobia who signed among the Chiefs a nd Warriors of the Choctaws on the Treaty of Doak's Stand in 1820 and Atto bah listed with \"Good\" credit at the Choctaw Trading House (see below). T he former was four years and the latter two years, before the Yowani Choct aws (Yguanes) petitioned the Mexican governor of Texas for permission to s ettle in the province. The Yowani Community in eastern Mississippi was loc ated east of the Chickasawhay River near present day Shubuta, Clarke Count y, Mississippi, across the current state line from Choctaw County, Alabam a. In Texas the villages prior to 1837 were located east of the Trinity Ri ver in what was then Nacogdoches County, west of the U.S. (Louisiana) Bord er (Correspondence Between General Manuel Mier y Terán and Texas 1828-1832 ). After 1837 the villages were combined to form a single village on Attoy ac Bayou in extreme southeastern Rusk County. By 1844, following the Trea ty of Birds Fort, there were two villages, one near the Cherokees under t he leadership of Chicken Trotter, in what would become the Mt. Tabor/Bellv iew Communities in Rusk County and the second under the leadership of Woo dy Jones (grandson of Nashoba), located in Houston County near the bord er with Trinity County. The southern village dwindled to only a few indivi duals until 1881, when John Martin Thompson opened mills in Trinity and An gelina counties near Woodlake and Diboll, thereby bringing a large numb er of Choctaws along with some Cherokees (Thompson's & Starr's) and Cree ks (Berryhill's & Posey's) into the area. (Stephen F. Austin State Univers ity-Thompson Collection)\n\nAdditional note: The village at Bayou Chicot in Louisiana was possibly aff iliated with Pushmataha and very hostlie to the Caddo tribe of whom they w arred against (Natsoos & Nassonites bands of Caddo's). The Yowani (Yguan es in Spanish), were at peace historically with the Hasinai Caddo's (a sou thern branch of the Caddo Confederacy), so much so the Mooney listed th em as a part of the Caddo Confederacy in Texas (Revised 1896 list. Also s ee Texas Indian Papers 1837 regarding Yowani-Hasinai relations.). The Yowa ni were known in Texas to support Choctaws from Okla Falaya which was le ad by Apukshunnubbee and opposed to Pushmataha and the Okla Hunnali town s. The Yowani were also known to inhabit lands well to the south of the Ba you Chicot area, attaching themselves to the Coushatta as well as the Cadd o. The great Coushatta Chief Red Shoes was believed to have been half Yowa ni Choctaw and half Koasati (Coushatta) the son of a Choctaw, possib ly by the same name, and Sehoy of the Wind Clan of the Koasati. Several Yo wani's accompanied Red Shoes from Texas back into Louisiana were a ba nd of that nation remain today. To add to this Dr. Irv May (Texas A&M Univ ersity) believed that Itobiah was the half brother of Red Shoes. Howeve r, no data was published by him prior to his death to support that assumpt ion.\n\nNote data on Choctaw Civil War (pro-French vs. pro-English faction): For the devastating Choctaw civil war of 1747-1750 there is a growing bo dy of scholarship. This conflict saw the Choctaws divided between French a nd English factions. The Okla Falaya towns sided with the English, the Ok la Tanap towns sided with the French, the Okla Hunnali towns were about eq ually divided, and the small Okla Chito division, in the center, was appar ently caught between the warring factions and exterminated. These events s parked a remarkable amount of publishing in the 18th century by people dir ectly involved, notably James Adair, the English trader among the Chickasa ws (HISTORY OF THE INDIANS, 1776)\n\nLawrence Henry Gipson's ch 4 in his vol 4 of his multi-volume study of t he colonial conflict between France and England in North America, publish ed in 1939. Gipson is one of the few people to take a close look at the Ch octaw civil war who was thoroughly acquainted with primary materials in bo th French and English archives; many scholars have doubted James Adair's t rustworthiness because he clearly had a lot of axes to grind and was finan cially interested in the events, but Gipson says he can find no instance a nywhere in the record of Adair telling anything but the truth (for the thi ngs that Adair said which can be verified from other sources); scholars ou ght to take a closer look at Adair. Regrettably, Charles Paape's 1946 diss ertation on the Choctaw civil war, titled \"The Choctaw Revolt,\" at the Uni versity of Illinois/Urbana, remains unpublished.\n\nTREATY WITH THE CHOCTAW -- 1820\n\nA treaty of friendship, limits, and accommodation, between the United Stat es of America and the Choctaw nation of Indians, begun and concluded at t he Treaty Ground, in said nation, near Doak's Stand, on the Natchez Road.\n\nPREAMBLE.

And in order that exact justice may be done to the poor a nd distressed of said nation, it shall be the duty of the agent to see th at the wants of every deaf, dumb, blind, and distressed, Indian, sha ll be first supplied out of said annuity, and the balance equally distribu ted amongst every individual of said nation.\n\nARTICLE 9.

Earle.[1]\n\nAt the time that the Yowanis ventured into Louisiana, the territory was under Spanish control. In 1800, Spain traded Louisiana to France, and the following year the United States purchased the land. Many residents of Louisiana, including many of the Indian tribes, did not wish to be under the authority of the United States. Spain agreed to allow several Indian tribes, including the Yowani Choctaw and the Alabama-Coushatta, to relocate to the neighboring Spanish province of Texas. Other Indian tribes later emigrated to Texas to avoid the Americans; this included the Cherokee, Muscogee-Creek, Seminole, Shawnee, Delaware, Quapaw, Kickapoo and Miami Indians. Following the Mexican War of Independence, Mexico assumed control of Texas. In 1824, another group of Yowani, led by Atahobia, petitioned the Mexican government to settle within the province of Texas. They were given permission to establish several villages east of the Trinity River and west of the border with Louisiana.\n\nDuring the period between 1810 and 1836, many of the relocated tribes, including the Yowani Choctaw, were often subject to attacks from the Comanche who roamed the western part of Texas, as well as the Lipan Apache, who were located in the southern part of the province. The Yowani often joined forces with the English-speaking settlers against the nomadic tribes.\n\nBy 1832, all but two families had left the traditional Yowani lands in Mississippi to migrate west. Although some settled briefly in what is now Rapides Parish, Louisiana, by 1850 many of the Yowani had settled in the Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory. A small number did remain in Louisiana and established a close bond with the Coushatta.\n\nThe Mount Tabor Community continued to grow after Texas joined the United States in 1845. President James K. Polk granted permission to the Ridge Party of Cherokees to relocate there from Indian Territory. More Yowani Choctaws, led by Atahobia's grandson Archibald Thompson, also relocated to the Mount Tabor Community by 1850.[2]\n\nMargaret McCoy-Thompson was the daughter of Atahobia (also spelled Atobah and Itahobiah) a full blood Choctaw and Sally McCoy a half blood Chickasaw. Sally was the daughter of Joshua McCoy Jr and a full blood Chickasaw woman, possibly the daughter of Nahettaly of the Chickasaw. Joshua was the son of Joshua McCoy Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth Butt.[3]\n\nSources\n\n↑ FAMILY TIES by J. C.
