Gatschet says the archaic name of the tribe wasNawadishe, from witish, 'salt'; Joutel (Margry, Dec, in, 390, 1878) corroborates this by saying that Naozidiche means 'salt', and that the village bearing this name was so called because of the salt supply near by). One of the 12 or more tribes of the Hasinai, or southern Caddo, confederacy. They spoke the common language of the group. Their main village stood for a century or more 3 or 4 leagues w. of Neches r. and near Arroyo San Pedro, at a site close to the old San Antonio road, which became known as San Pedro. This name clung to the place throughout the 18th century, and seems still to cling to it, since San Pedro cr. and the village of San Pedro, in Houston co., Tex., are in the same general vicinity as old San Pedro. In 1687 a well-beaten path led past this village to the Hasinai hunting grounds beyond the Brazos (Joutel in Margry, Dec, in, 325, 326, 332, 1878). It perhaps became a part of the later San Antonio road. The Nouadiche mentioned by Bienville in 1700 (Margry, Dec, iv, 441, 1881) and the Amediche mentioned by La Harpe in 1719 (ibid., vi, 262, 1886) are clearly the Nabedache of San Pedro. Joutel (ibid., in, 388, 1878) tells us that the Naodiche village, which he passed through some 15 leagues N. E. of San\n\n9\n\nNABEDACHE\n\nPedro, was allied to the latter, and it seems probable that it belonged to the same tribe. The Naouydiche mentioned by La Harpe in 1719, however, are not so easily identified with the Nabedache, since he associates them with the Tonkawa, calls them a wandering tribe which until La Salle's coming had been at war with the Kadohadacho, and on the same page mentions the Amediche apparently as a distinct tribe (Margry, Dec, vi, 262, 277, 1886). Yet the facts that the '' great chief\" of the Naouydich.es, of \"whom. La Harpe writes, spoke the language of the Nassonites, i. e., Caddoan, and that the Nouadiche of Bienville's account were the Nabedache, make it probable that those of La Harpe's account were the same people. Concerning the Nabedache of San Pedro, always in historic times the chief village of the tribe, the information is relatively full and satisfactory. They are the first Texas tribe of which there is a definite account, and because of their location on the western frontier of the Hasinai group and on the highway from Mexico to Louisiana they are frequently mentioned during the 18th century. La Salle passed through this village in 1686 on his way to the southern Nasoni, and by \"the great Coenis village\" of Douay's account of this expedition is meant specifically the Nabedache village w. of Neches r. and the Neche village just on the other side (Douay in French, Hist. Coll. La., iv, 204-205, 1852). Joutel's description of the Cenis ( Hasinai) , as distinguished from the southern Nasoni and the Kadohadacho, is based on his sojourn at the Nabedache and Neche villages (Margry, Dec, in, 339-356, 1878); likewise Jesus Maria's invaluable account of the Hasinai was written at his mission near the Nabedache village (Francisco de Jesus Maria, MS. Relacion, Aug. 15, 1691). The political, social, and economic organization, as ~well as the general exterior relations of this tribe, were much the same as those of the confederate tribes, and are described under Neche (q. v.). Joutel, in 1687, informs us that from the western edge of the Nabedache village to the chief's house it was a \"large league\" (Margry, Dec, in, 341,1878). _ The houses on the way were grouped into \"hamlets\" of from 7 to 15, and surrounded by fields. Similar '' hamlets'' were scattered all the way to the Neches. In the middle of the settlement was a large assembly house, or town house (ibid., 343). FatherDamianMassanet (Tex. Hist. Assn. Quar., II, 303, 1899) thus describes the caddi's or chief's house as he saw it in 1690: \"We came to the governor's house, where we found a number of Indians— men, women, and children. . . The\n\n[B. A. H.\n\nhouse is built of stakes thatched over with grass; it is about 20 varas high, is round, and has no windows, daylight entering through the door only; this door is like a room door such as we have here [in Mexico]. In the middle of the house is the fire, which is never extinguished by day or by night, and over the door on the inner side there is a little mound of pebbles very prettily arranged. Ranged around one-half of the house, inside, are 10 beds, which consist of a rug made of reeds, laid on 4 forked sticks. Over the rug they spread buffalo skins, on which they sleep. At the head and foot of the bed is attached another carpet, forming a sort of arch, which, lined with a very brilliantly colored piece of reed matting, makes what bears some resemblance to a very pretty alcove. In the other half of the house, where there are no beds, there are some shelves about 2 varas high, and on them are ranged large round baskets made of reeds (in \"which they keep their corn, nuts, acorns, beans, etc.), a row of very large earthen pots like our earthen jars, . . . and 6 wooden mortars for pounding corn in rainy weather (for when it is fair they grind it in the courtyard).\" Besides \"what is learned of Hasinai foods in general we are told by Solis, who visited San Pedro in 1768, that the Nabedache used a root called tuqui, which was somewhat like the Cuban cassava. They ground it in mortars and ate it with bear's fat, of which they were particularly fond. Solis also tells us that resident there at this time was an Indian woman of great authority, named Sanate Adiva, meaning 'great woman', or 'chief woman'; that she lived in a house of many rooms; that the other tribes brought her presents, and that she had 5 husbands and many servants (Diario, Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxvn, 280, 281, MS.). Though the Nabedache were a peaceable'people, they had many enemies, and in war they were high-spirited and cruel. In 1687 they and the Neche, aided by some of JoUtel's party, made a successful campaign against the '' Canohatinno.'' On the return one female captive was scalped alive and sent back to her people with a challenge (Joutel in Margry, Dec, in, 377, 1878), while another was tortured to death by the women (ibid., 378). La Harpe reported that in 1714 the Nabedache (Amediches) and other Hasinai tribes were at war with the lower Natchitoch (ibid., yi, 193, 1886). In 1715 a party of Hasinai, including Nabedache, joined St. Denis in an expedition . to Mexico. On the way a fierce battle was fought near San Marcos r. (apparently the Colorado) with 200 coast Indians, \"always their chief enemies'' ( San Denis, Declara-\n\nBULL,. 30]\n\nNABEDACHE\n\ncion, 1715, Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxvn, 124, MS.). Wars with the Apache were frequent. In 1719 Du Rivage met on Red r. a party of Naouydiches and other tribes who had just won a victory over this enemy (Margry, Dec, vi, 277, 1886). Shortly after this, La Harpe was joined near the Arkansas by the Naouydiche \"great chief\" and 40 warriors (ibid., 286). We are told that the Nabedache, with other Hasinai, aided the French in 1730 in their war with the Natchez (Mezieres in Mem. de Nueva Espana, XXVIII, 229). Early in the 18th century the Nabedache seem generally to have been hostile to the Tonkawan tribes; but later, hatred for the Apache made them frequently allies, and we now hear of the Tonkawans selling Apache captives to the Nabedache. The possession at San Pedro in 1735 of some captive Apache women secured in this way threatened to cause war between the Spaniards and the Apache. The Spaniards, to avoid trouble, ransomed the women and sent them home (Gov. Barrios y Juaregui to the Viceroy, Apr. 17, 1753, MS. Archivo General, Historia, 299). In 1791, after fierce warfare between the Lipan and the combined northern Indians—the Wichita, Hasinai, and Tonkawa—the Apache endeavored to secure the aid of the Hasinai against the Tonkawa, but Gil Ybarbo, Spanish commander at Nacogdoches, prevented it (Ybarbo to the Governor, Apr. 26, 1791, Bexar Archives, Nacogdoches, 1758—93, MS.). Common hostility toward the Apache frequently made the Nabedache and the Comanche friends, but this friendship was unstable. The military relations of the Nabedache in the 19th century have not yet been investigated, but it is known that hostility to the Apache continued -well into that period. In May, 1690, Massanet and Capt. Domingo Ramon founded the first Texas mission (San Francisco de los Texas) at the Nabedache village, and a few months later the second (Santisima Nombre de Maria) -was planted near by (Jesus Maria, Relacion, 1691). On May 25, De Le6n delivered to the Nabedache caddi a baston and a cross, and conferred on him the title of \"governor of all his pueblos\" (De Leon, Derrotero, 1690). This was done, as Jesus Maria clearly shows, under the mistaken notion that the Nabedache was the head tribe of the confederacy, and its caddi the head chief. These distinctions belonged, however, to the Hainai tribe and the great chenesi resident there (ibid., 18). This mistake, it is believed, caused some political disturbance in the confederacy. In 1690-91 an epidemic visited the tribe in common with its neighbors (JesusMaria, Relacion,\n\n1691). Trouble, fomented by medicinemen and soldiers, soon arose between the missionaries and the Indians. In 1692 the chief, -with most of his people, withdrew from the mission to the distant \"fields,\" and refused to return (Massenet, MS., 1692). In 1693 the mission was abandoned (Clark in Tex. Hist. Assn. Quar., v, 200-201, 1902), and when restored in 1716 it was placed at the Neche village on the other side of the river. In 1727 Rivera (Diario, leg. 2093, 1736) reported that San Pedro was then occupied by the Neche, though formerly by the Nabedache. That the Neche had moved to San Pedro is perhaps true; but it seems improbable that the Nabedache had left the place, for long afterward the inhabitants of it continued to be called Nabedache (De Soto Bermudez docs., 1753, MS. Archivo General, Historia, 299; Mezieres, Cartas, 1779). When Solis visited the Nabedache in 1768 their customs were still about as first described, except that they had nearly discarded the bow for the firelock, and were very inebriate, due, Solis claimed, to French liquor. In the middle of the 18th century French influence over the Hasinai greatly increased, and Spanish influence declined. In 1753 the Nabedache took part in a gathering of the tribes at the Nadote (Nadaco?) village, in which, it was reported, the Indians proposed killing all the Spaniards in eastern Texas; but St. Denis, of Natchitoches, prevented the attempt (Fr. Calahorra y Sanz, Feb. 23, 1753, MS. Archivo General, Historia, 299). This situation led to a plan, which failed, to have a garrison posted at San Pedro (Barrios y Juaregui to the Viceroy, ibid.). In 1778 or 1779 an epidemic reduced the population, and Mezieres, writing from \"San Pedro Nevadachos,\" situated apparently just where Joutel had found it, reported the number of warriors at somewhat more than 160 (Carta, Aug. 26, 1779, Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxviii, 241). In 1805 Sibley gave the number at 80 men; but about 1809 Davenport, who was at Nacogdoches, gave it as 100 (Report to Manuel Salcedo, copy dated Apr. 24, 1809, in Archivo General, Provincias Internas, 201). Sibley's and Davenport's reports and Austin's map of 1829 all indicate that the tribe had moved up Neches r. after 1779 (original Austin map, in Secretaria de Fomento, Mexico). From a letter in the Bexar Archives it appears that this migration may have occurred before 1784 (Neve to Cabello, Bexar Archives, Province of Texas, 1781-84). In the 19th century the Nabedache shared the fate of the other tribes of the Caddo and Hasinai confed-\n\nNABESNATANAeracies, and the survivors are now on the (allotted) Wichita res. in Oklahoma, but are not separately enumerated, (H.

They first became known to the French about 1690, and according to La Harpe their villages in 1719 were N. of the Hainai. During the disturbances between the Spaniards and French in the 18th century the Nacaniche seem to have abandoned their more northerly villages and, about 1760, to have concentrated on Trinity r., near the road leading to New Mexico. The tribe was included in the Texas census of 1790 as among those which were under the jurisdiction of Nacogdoches. The Nacaniche were exposed to the same adverse influences that destroyed so large a part of their kindred. They clung to the Nabedache during the trying experiences of the first half of the 19th century, and if any survive they are with the Caddo (q. v.) on the Wichita res., Okla. A stream in E.

' In 1716 Nuestra Senorade Guadalupe mission was founded for this tribe and the Nacogdoche (Francisco Hidalgo and Manuel Castellano, letter to Pedro Mesquia, Oct. 6, 1716, MS. Arcbivo General). This fact, taken with the statement of Jesus Maria, makes it seem probable that the tribe lived N. of the Nacogdoche. After 1716 the Nacau seem to disappear from history as an independentgroup; it was perhaps absorbed by the Nacogdoche. (H. E. B.) Nacao.—San Denis, 1715, op. cit.

In behalf of the Iowa he signed the treaty of St Louis, Nov. 23, 1837, and in the same year visited Washington, where his portrait was painted for the War Department by Charles B.

They were first mentioned by Joutel in 1687, at which time they were at enmity with theCenis (Caddo confederacy).. When Bienville and St Denis were exploring Red r. of La., in 1700, they found on that stream a village of the Nacisi consisting of 8 houses. They \"were still in this neighborhood in 1741, but during the vicissitudes of the 18th century seem to have drifted southward beyond the border of the French province, for in 1790 they are mentioned among the tribes under the jurisdiction of Nacogdoches, in Texas.

It has been said that their language differed from that of the Hasinai group in general, but there is much evidence to indicate that this is not true. For example, Ramon, who founded missions at the Neche, Hainai, Nasoni, and Nacogdoche villages in 1716, states in his report that '' these four missions will comprise from four to five thousand persons of both sexes, all of one idiom\" (Representaci6n, July 22, 1716, in Mem. de Nueva Espafia, xxvn, 160, MS.). On the same day the missionaries wrote that the Nacogdoche mission \"N. S. de Guadalupe ... is awaiting people of the same language and customs\" as those of the Indians of mission Concepcion, i. e., the Hainai (ibid., 163). In 1752, when the governor of Texas wras arranging to inspect the villages of the Hainai, Nabedache,\n\ntB. A. E.\n\nNacogdoche, Nasoni, and Nadote, Antonio Barrera was appointed interpreter, because he was a person \"understanding with all perfection the idiom of these Indians,\" the implication being that they all spoke a single language (Jacinto de Barrios y Juaregui, Oct. 30, 1752, in Archivo General, Hist., 299, MS. ). Mezieres said that the Nabedache, Nadaco (Anadarko), Hainai, and Nacogdoche spoke the same language (letter toCroix, Feb. 20, 1778, Mem. de Nueva Espafia, xxvin, 229, MS.). Other similar evidence might be cited. Their main village at the opening of the 18th century and for a long time thereafter was approximately on the site of the modern city of Nacogdoches, where four Indian mounds existed until recently. This place seems to have been called Nevantin. The Nacogdoche were mentioned apparently by the Gentleman of Elvas in his account of the De Soto expedition; but they -were first made definitely known by Jesus Maria in 1691, who called them the Nazadachotzi, indicated correctly their location, and classified them as one of the nine Aseney (Hasinai) tribes (Relacion, 108, MS.). It seems probable that the Nacogdoche are distinct from the Aquodocez, with whom Penicaut in 1714 said the Assinais were at war (Margry, Dec, v, 504, 1883). At this time San Denis found the Nacogdoche, Hainai, Nadaco (Anadarko), and others at war with the lower Natchitoch, but he restored peace among them (La Harpe in Margry, Dec, vi, 193, 1886; see also letter of Macartij, Nov. 17, 1763, Nacogdoches Archives, MS.). Espinosa tells us that the Nasoni, whose main village was some 25 m. to the N., were especially closely allied with the Nacogdoche, and came to their village for some of their principal religious observances (Chronica Apostolica, i, 425, 1746). In July, 1716, the Franciscans of the college at Zacatecas established their first Texas mission at the main Nacogdoche village for this tribe and the Nacao. This mission became the headquarters of the president, Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus (Espinosa, Diario, entries for July 5-8, MS., Archivo General). In 1719 the mission, like all the others of E. Texas, was abandoned through fear of a French attack, but was reestablished in 1721 on the same site (Pefia, Diario, Mem. de Nueva Espafia, xxvin, 44, MS.). The mission continued to exist long after three of its neighbors had been removed; but it had very little success, and in 1773 it was abandoned. The Spanish settlers, who were removed at this time from Adaes, and at whose head was Antonio Gil Ybarbo, were allowed to settle on the Trinity, founding in 1774 a place which\n\nBULL,. 30]\n\nNACOGDOOHE\n\nthey called Pilar de Bucareli. Early in 1779 they migrated, without authority, to the site of the Nacogdoches mission. The modern city of Nacogdoches dates from this time. The Nacogdoche were nominally within the Spanish jurisdiction, but the French early gained their affection through the unlicensed trade which they conducted with the Indians. The French supplied guns, ammunition, knives, cloth, vermilion, and knickknacks, in return for horses, skins, bear's fat in great quantities, corn, beans, and Apache captives. This trade, particularly that in firearms, was opposed by the Spanish officials, and as a result there were frequent disputes on the frontier, the Indians sometimes taking one side and sometimes the other. In 1733, for example, two Nacogdoche chiefs reported at Adaes that the French had offered them a large reward if they would destroy the Spanish presidio of Adaes (Expediente sobre la Campana, etc., 1739, Archivo General, Provincias Internas, xxxn, MS.). The charge was denied, of course, by the French. Again, in August, 1750, it was said that the Nacogdoche chief, Chacaiauchia, or Sanchez, instigated as he claimed by San Denis of Natchitoches, went to the Nacogdoches mission, threatened the life of the missionary, Father Calahorra y Sanz, and ordered him to depart with all the Spaniards (Testimonio de Autos de Pesquiza sobre Comercio Ylicito, 1751, B6xar Archives, Adaes, 1739-55, MS.). On the other hand, when in 1752 a gathering of tribes was held at the Nadote village to discuss a plan for attacking all the Spanish establishments, the Nacogdoche chief, apparently Chacaiauchia, and San .Denis both appear in the light of defenders of the Spaniards (Testimony of Calahorra y Sanz in De Soto Bermudez, Report of Investigation, Archivo General, Hist., 299, MS.). Chacaiauchia, or Sanchez, seems to have retained the chieftaincy a long time, for in 1768 Soli's tells of being visited at the mission by Chief Sanchez, a man of large following (Diario in Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxvn, 282, MS.). Some data as to the numerical strength of the tribe are extant. In 1721, when Aguayo refounded the mission, he provided clothing for \"the chief and all the rest,\" a total of 390 (Pena, Diario, in Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxvn, 44, MS.). This may have included some Nacao, and, on the other hand, it may not have included all of the Nacogdoche tribe. It was reported that in 1733 the two Nacogdoche chiefs mentioned above went to Adaes with 60 warriors (Expediente sobre la Campana, 1739, op. cit. ). It is not known whether the warriors were all Nacogdoche or not, but that is the implication. In\n\n1752 De Soto Bermudez inspected the Nacogdoche pueblo and reported that it consisted of 11 \" rancherias grandes,'' containing 52 warriors, besides many youths nearly able to bear arms (Pep. of Investigation, 1752, Archivo General, Hist., 299). Croix's list of 1778 does not include the Nacogdoche, unless they are his Nacogdochitos, a group of 30 families living on the Attoyac (Relacion Particular, Archivo General, Prov. Intern., 182). According to a census of 1790, on the authority of Gatschet, the Nacogdoche were reduced to 34 men, 31 women, 27 boys, and 23 girls. Davenport, in 1809, reported the Nacogdochitos as comprising 50 men (Noticia, Archivo General, Prov. Intern., 201, MS.). By 1752 the Nacogdoche pueblo had been removed some 3 leagues northward (De Soto Bermudez, op. cit.). When this transfer took place is not clear, but Mezieres says that they deserted the mission at once (Carta, Aug. 23,1779, in Mem. de Nueva Espana, xxvui, 225, MS.) . In 1771 Gov. Barrios reported them as still near the Hainai (Informe, 2, MS.). It seems probable that a considerable part of the Nacogdoche tribe was absorbed in the general population at Nacogdoches after the settlement of the Spaniards in 1779, for census reports thereafter show a large number of Indians and mixed-bloods at that place. After this time the remnant of the tribe seems sometimes to appear as Nacogdochitos. Morn, about 1781, located this tribe on the Attoyac. In 1809 Davenport, writing from Nacogdoches, did not name the Nacogdoches in the list of surrounding tribes, but placed the Nacogdochitos on the Angelina, 5 leagues N. of Nacogdoches (Noticia, Archivo General, Prov. Intern., 201, MS.). A Spanish map made between 1795 and 1819 shows the \"Nacodoches\" above where Davenport put the \" Nocogdochitos,\" i. e., on the E. side of the Angelina about halfway between Nacogdoches and Sabine r. (MS. Mapa Geografica de las Provincias Septentrionales de esta Nueva Espana). In habit, ceremony, and social organization the Nacogdoche resembled the other tribes of the Hasinai confederacy. (H. E.

One of the tribes of the Hasinai, or southern Caddo, confederacy. In 1691 Francisco de Jesus Maria (Relaci6n, 108, MS.) located it s. E. of the Neche and Nabedache tribes. In 1721 the Indians of \"el Macono,\" evidently the same, lived 5 leagues from the Neche tribe. In 1716 San Francisco de los Texas mission was founded near the Neche and Nacachau villages to minister to these two tribes and to the Nabedache and Nacono (Hidalgo, letter, Oct. 6, 1716, MS., Archivo General). Espinosa, who was present at the founding of San Joseph de los Nasones misson, said that it was composed of Nasoni and Nacono, but the latter were more likely the Nadaco (Anadarko). In 1721 Aguayowas visited on the Neches r. by 100 Indians from el Macono, who were still regarded as belonging to San Francisco mission. Pena, in his diary of this expedition, makes the interesting statement that \"their chief, who is also chief priest to their idols, is blind. It is presumed that after having been chief many years, he put out his eyes, according to a custom of the Indians, in order to become chief priest among them\" (Diario, Mem. de NuevaEspafia, XXVIII, 35, MS.). As their name disappears thereafter, unless they were the Nacomones of Rivera's list (1727), they were, apparently, like numerous other Texan tribes, absorbed by their stronger neighbors. (H. E.

Naden-hadai (Ne'dAn xa'da-i, 'Naden river people'). A subdivision of the Koetas, a family of the Raven clan of the Haida. Unlike the rest of the family this subdivision remained on Queen Charlotte ids. and settled on Naden r.—Swanton, Cont. Haida, 272, 1905. Nadohotzosn ( ' point of the mountain'). A band of theChiricahua Apache (Bourke in Jour. Am. Folk-lore, in, 115, 1890), essentially the same as the Natootzuzn of the White Mountain Apache and the Nagosugn of the Final Coyoteros. Nadowa, A name, expressing utter detestation, applied by various Algonquian tribes to a number of their neighboring and most inveterate enemies. Its use was not limited to the tribes of a single linguistic stock, the historical references showing that it was applied in some instances, in a modified form, to Eskimo, Siouan, and Iroquoian peoples. For synonyms see Eskimo, Dakota, Iroquois, Iowa, Teton, and Nottoway. The etymology of the term is in doubt. The analvsis proposed by Gerard (Am. Anthrop.; vi, 319, 326, 1904), namely, 'he goes to seek flesh to eat,' while grammatically permissible, is historically improbable, being too general. In N. United States the original application of the word appears to have been to vari-\n\nBULL. SO]\n\nISTAENSHYA\n\nous small, dark-colored poisonous rattlesnakes, inhabiting the lake and prairie regions, such as the Crotalophorus tergeminus (Sistrurus catenatus), and possibly to C.kirtlandi, the black massasauga. Cuoq gives as the meaning of the term natowe, a \"kind of large serpent formerly quite common in the neighborhood of Michillimakina, i. e., Mackinac, the flesh of which the Indians ate; the Algonkin and all nations of the Algonquian tongue give this name to the Iroquois and to tribes of the Iroquoian stock.'' The Menominee (Hoffman) apply the term to the massasauga rattlesnake, and the Chippewa (Tanner) to a \"thick, short rattlesnake.\" In Tanner's list of Ottawa tribal names are found Nautowaig, Naudoways, 'rattlesnakes,' and Matchenawtoways, 'bad Naudoways,' and in a footnote to the word Anego, 'ant,' it is stated that these same Naudoway Indians relate a fable of an old man and an old woman to the effect that these two watched an ant-hill until the ants therein became transformed into white men, and the eggs which these ants were carrying in their mouths were transformed into bales of merchandise. But in none of these references are the people so named thereby defined in such manner that without other information they may be recognized by other nomenclature. The word \"Sioux\" is itself an abbreviation of the diminutive of this term, namely, Nadowe-is-iw, literally ' he is a small massasauga rattlesnake,' the sensegiving part of the word being dropped, but signifying 'enemy,' 'enemies.' This diminutive form, with the qualifying epithet Mascoutens, was a name of the Iowa and the Teton. In Virginia the term, -which became Anglicized into \"Nottoway,\" was applied to an Iroquoian tribe resident there. In this locality it is probable that the name was applied originally to the rattlesnake common to this eastern region. (j. N. B. H. ) Naenshya (Nae'nsx'a, 'dirty teeth').

A former Chippewa village in lower Michigan (Smith in Ind. Aff. Rep., 53, 1851). A chief of this name represented a band on \"South Monistic'' r.in 1835 (Mich. Fion. Coll.,xn, 622,1888). See also Nagonub, Naguonabe. Nagonub (Niganubi, or Niganub, ' the foremost sitter'). A Chippewa Indian, born about 1815, and first mentioned as attracting the attention of Gen. Lewis Cass by his sprightliness while but a mere lad. So well pleased was Cass that he gave Nagonub a medal and a written token of his precocity. He attained notoriety through his spirited and often fiery oratory, and his unusually courteous manners won for him the declaration that he was the \"beau ideal of an Indian chief\" (Morse in Wis. Hist. Soc. Coll., in, 349, 1857). Nagonub is said also to have been an especial favorite with the white ladies, whom he greeted with the ease and grace of a courtier. He signed as first chief of the Fond du Lac Chippewa the treaties of La Fointe, Wis., Oct. 4, 1842, and Sept. 30, 1854. His portrait, painted by J. O. Lewis and copied by King in 1827, hung in the Indian Gallery of the Smithsonian building at Washington, but was destroyed by fire in 1865. His name is also written Naa-gar-nep, Na-gan-nab, and Naw-gawnub. (c. T. ) Nagosugn. A band of the Final Coyoteros found in 1881 by Bourke (Jour. Am.

An Athapascan division occupying the region of British Columbia and Yukon Ter. between the Coast range and the Rocky mts., from the N. border of the Sekani, about 57° N. , to that of the Kutchin tribes, about 65° N. It comprises the Tahltan and Takutine tribes forming the Tahltan division, the Titshdtina and Etagottine tribes forming the Kaska division, and the Esbataottine and Abbatotine (considered by Petitot to be the same tribe), Sazeutina, Ettchaottine, Etagottine, Kraylongottine, Klokegottine, and perhaps Lakuyip and Tsetsaut. They correspond with Petitot's Montagnard group, except that he included also the Sekani. The language of the Nahane however constitutes a dialect by itself, entirely distinct from Sekani, Carrier, or Kutchin. The western divisions have been powerfully influenced by their Tlingit neighbors of Wrangell, and have adopted their clan organization with maternal descent, the potlatch customs of the coast tribes, and many words and expressions of their language. The two principal social divisions or phratries are called Raven and Wolf, and the fact that Sazeutina and Titshotina seem to signify 'Bear people' and ' Grouse people ' respectively, leads Morice to suspect that these groups are really phratries or clans. The eastern Nahane have a loose paternal organization like the Sekani and other Athapascan tribes farther E. According to Morice the Nahane have suffered very heavily as a result of white contact. He estimates the entire population at about 1,000. Consult Morice in Trans. Can. Inst., vn, 517534, 1904. See Tahltan. (J. E. S.) Dene des Montagnes-Rocheuses.—Petitot, Diet. Dene Dindjie, xx, 1876.

They used to give away so much grease at their feasts that the floor of their house was said to be \"muddy\" with it, hence the name.—Swanton, Cont. Haida, 276, 1905. Nahche (Na-ai-che, 'mischievous,' 'meddlesome.'—George Wrattan). An Apache warrior, a member of the Chiricahua band. He is the second son of the celebrated Cochise, and as hereditary chief succeeded his eider brother, Tazi, on the death of the latter. His mother was a daughter of the notorious Mangas Coloradas. As a child Nahche was meddlesome and mischievous, hence his name. He was the leading spirit in the many raids that almost desolated the smaller\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nNAHELTA\n\nsettlements of Arizona and New Mexico and of northern Chihuahua and Sonora between 1881 and 1886, for which Geronimo, a medicine-man and malcontent rather than a warrior, received the chief credit. In the latter year Geronimo's band, so called, of which Nahche was actually the chief, was captured by General Miles and taken as prisoners of war successively to Florida, Alabama, and finally to Ft Sill, Okla., where Nahche still resides, respected by his own people as well as by the whites. He is now (1907) about 49 years of age. In his prime as a warrior he was described as supple and graceful, with long, flexible hands, and a rather handsome face. His present height is 5ft. 10J in. Col. H. L. Scott (inf'n, 1907),\n\nfor four years in charge of the Chiricahua prisoners in Oklahoma, speaks of Nahche as a most forceful and reliable man, faithfully performing the duties assigned to him as a prisoner, whether watched or not. He was proud and self-respecting, and was regarded by the Chiricahua at Ft Sill as their leader. In recent years, however, he has lost his old-time influence as well as some of his trustworthiness (inf'n from Geo. Wrattan, official interpreter, 1907). Nahelta (Na-hel-ta).

Aprominent warrior of Black Hawk's band of Sauk andFoxes in the Black Hawk war of 1832. According to Whittlesey ( Wis. Hist. Coll., i, 71-2, 84, repr. 1903) Black Hawk was opposed to the war, but was overruled by the young men, who were sustained by Nahpope, who manifested intense hatred of the Americans. He \"was, however, largely influenced by Waupeshek, the socalled Prophet. Little has been recorded regarding his life. It is known that he took an active part in the Black Hawk war, and special mention is made of his command in the battle of Wisconsin heights, on Wisconsin r., near the present Sauk City, Wis. Here Nahpope's band, reenforced by a score of Black Hawk's warriors, made a valiant stand to cover the flight of the main body of his people down the bluffs and across the river, which was accomplished with slight loss. During the night following the battle the Americans were for a time in a panic, caused by the noise in the Indian camp, which proved to have been only the applause of a speech by Nahpope in which he endeavored to arouse the Winnebago to remain with them in the contest. Nahpope continued in the war to its close, was captured and imprisoned with Black Hawk and his son, and finally released with them. While Nahpope was confined at Jefferson Barracks, Catlin painted his portrait. As his name is not appended to any treaty made by the Sauk and Foxes \"with the United States, the omission may be attributed to his contempt for the Americans. In the summer preceding the Black Hawk war he visited the English authorities at Ft Maiden, Ontario, to consult them in regard to the rights of the Indians to their lands. After his release from prison nothing more is heard of him. His name is also written Naapope and Neapope. (c. T. ) Nairn (Na'-liu).

Anciently it was occupied by several families, including the Huados, Kunalanas, and Stlenga-lanas, but owing to internal troubles they separated, abandoning the town. Later on the Naikunstustai settled there, and still later the Kuna-lanas returned. John Work, in 1836-41, assigned to Naikun 5 houses and 122 inhabitants. This must have been the Kuna-lanas town.

It was established for the converted Indians, chiefly Delawares, who wished to live separately from their tribe, and for this purpose land was obtained from the state government. InMay, 1763, a new and enlarged chapel was dedicated, the congregation having increased in numbers and prosperity.

A well-known tribe that formerly lived on and about St Catherine's cr., E. and s. of the present city of Natchez, Miss. The name, belonging to a single town, was extended to the tribe and entire group of towns, which included also peoples of alien blood who had been conquered by the Natchez or had taken refuge with them. Iberville, on his ascent of the Mississippi in 1699, names, in the Choctaw language, the following 8 towns, exclusive of Natchez proper: Achougoulas, Cogoucoula, Ousagoucoula, Pochougoula, Thoucoue, Tougoulas, Yatanocas, and Ymacachas. Of these, Tougoulas and perhaps Thoucoue are the Tioux (q. v.) towns. It is probably safe to infer that the 9 towns, including Natchez, represented the entire group, and that the Corn, Gray, Jenzenaque, White Apple, and AVhite Earth villages are only other names for some of the above, with which it is now impossible to identify them. The Tioux and Grigras were two nations under the protection of the Natchez; both were of alien blood. Du Pratz alludes to a tradition that the Taensa and Chitimacha were formerly united with the Natchez, but left them, though the latter had always recognized them as brothers. The Taensa were, indeed, probably an offshoot of the Natchez, but the Chitimacha were of a distinct linguistic family. It is difficult to form an estimate of the numerical strength of this tribe, as the figures given vary widely. It is probable that in 1682, when first visited by the French, they numbered about 6,000, and were able to put from 1,000 to 1,200 warriors in the field.\n\n36\n\nNATCHEZ\n\nThe Natchez engaged in thi-ee wars with the French, in 1716, 1722, and 1729. The last, which proved fatal to their nation, was caused by the attempt of the French governor, Chopart, to occupy the site of their principal village as a plantation, and it opened with a general massacre of the French at Fort Rosalie, established in 1716. The French, in retaliation, attacked the Natchez villages with a strong force of Choctaw allies, and in 1730 the Natchez abandoned their villages, separating into three bodies. A small section remained not far from their former home, and a second body fled to Sicily id., near Washita r., where they were attacked early in 1731 by the French, many of them killed, and about 450 captured and sold into slavery in Santo Domingo. The third and most numerous division was received by the Chickasaw and built a village near them in N. Mississippi, called by Adair, Nanne Hamgeh; in 1735 these refugees numbered 180 warriors, or a total of about 700. In the year last named a body of Natchez refugees settled in South Carolina by permission of the colonial government, but some years later moved up to the Cherokee country, where they still kept their distinct town and language up to about the year 1800. The principal body of refugees, however, had settled on Tallahassee cr., an affluent of Coosa r. Hawkins in 1799 estimated their gun-men at about 50. They occupied the whole of one town called Nauchee and part of Abikudshi. The Natchez were therefore not exterminated by the French, as has frequently been stated, but after suffering severelossestheremainder scattered far and wide among alien tribes. A few survivors, who speak their own language, still exist in Indian Ter., living with the Cherokee, and in the councils of the Creeks until recently had one representative. Though the accounts of the Natchez that have come down to us appear to be highly colored, it is evident that this tribe, and doubtless others on the lower Mississippi, occupied a somewhat anomalous position among the Indians. They seem to have been a strictly sedentary people, depending for their livelihood chiefly upon agriculture. They had developed considerable skill in the arts, and wove a textile fabric from the inner bark of the mulberry which they employed for clothing. They made excellent pottery and raised mounds of earth upon which to erect their dwellings and temples. They were also one of the eastern tribes that practised headflattening. In the main the Natchez appear to have been peaceable, though like other tribes they were involved in frequent quarrels with their neighbors. All accounts agree in attributing to them an\n\nLB. A. H.\n\nextreme form of sun worship and a highly developed ritual. Moreover, the position and function of chief among them difered markedly from that among other tribes, as their head chief seems to have had absolute power over the property and lives of his subjects. On his death his wives were expected to surrender their lives, and parents offered their children as sacrifices. The nation was divided into two exogamic classes, nobility and commoners or michmichgupi, the former being again divided into suns, nobles proper, and esteemed men. Children of women of these three had the rank of their mother, but children of common women fell one grade below that of their father. There were various ways, however, by which a man could raise himself from one grade to another at least as far as the middle grade of nobles. While the commoners consisted partially of subject tribes, the great majority appear to have been as pure Natchez as the nobility. In spite of great lexical divergence, there is little doubt that the Natchez language is a Muskhogean dialect. Consult Catschet, Creek Migr.

The principal village of the Natchez, probably situated on St Catherine's cr., near the Liberty road bridge, about3 m. from the present city of Natchez, Miss. Later this name was given to a town of the refugee Natchez among the Upper Creeks. Natchitoch (Caddo form, NdshVtosh). A tribe of the Caddo confederacy which spoke a dialect similar to that of the Yatasi but different from that of the Kadohadacho and its closely affiliated tribes. Their villages were in the neighborhood of the present city of Natchitoches, near those of another tribe called Doustioni (q. v.). Whether the army of De Soto encountered them is unknown, but after La Salle's tragic death among the Hasinai his companions traversed their country, and Douay speaks of them as a \"powerful nation.'' In 1690 Tonti reached them from the Mississippi and made an alliance; and in 1699 Iberville learned of them through a Taensa Indian, but did not visit them in person. Next year, however, he sent is brother Bienville across to them from the Taensa villages. From that time and throughout the many vicissitudes of the 18th century the tribe never broke faith with the French. In 1705 they came to St Denis, commandant of the first French fort on the Mississippi, and asked to be settled in someplace where they might obtain provisions, as their corn had been ruined. They -were placed near the Acolapissa, and remained there until 1712 when St Denis took them back to their old country to assist him in establishing a new post as a protection against Spanish encroachments, and also in the hope of opening up commercial relations. This post, to which a garrison was added in 1714, remained an important center for trade and travel toward the S. W. for more than a century. St Denis sent messages to the tribes living in the vicinity, urging them to abandon their villages and come to settle near the post, assuring them that he would never forsake them. Some of the tribes yielded to his persuasions, hoping to find safety during the disturbances of the period, but the movement only accelerated the disintegration already begun. In 1731, St Denis, at the head of the Natchitoch and other Indians, besides a few Spaniards, inflicted severe defeat on a strong party of Natchez under the Flour chief, killing about 80 of them. The Natchez, after their wars against the French, had fled to Red r. and were living not far from the trading post and fort. The importance of this establishment and the friendliness of the Natchitoch made the latter so conspicuous in the affairs of the time that during the first half of the 18th century Red r. was known as the Natchitock, a variant of Nashitosh\n\n-NATEEKIN\n\n37\n\nor Natchitoch. DuPratzstatesthatabout 1730 their village near the French post numbered 200 cabins. Owing to wars in which they were forced to take part, to the introduction of new diseases, particularly smallpox and measles, the population of the tribe rapidly declined. In his report to President Jefferson, in 1805, Sibley gives their number as only 50, and adds, \"The French inhabitants have a great respect for these natives, and a number of families have a mixture of their blood in them.\" Shortly afterward they ceased to exist as a distinct tribe, having been completely amalgamated with the other tribes of the Caddo confederacy (q. v.), from whom they differed in no essential of custom, or of ceremonial or social organization.

A village founded by Indian converts, mainly Massachuset, under the supervision of the noted missionary John Eliot, in 1650, near the present Natick, Mass. Soon after its establishment it numbered about 150 inhabitants, who were given a reserve of 6,000 acres. It increased in population and after King Philip's war was the principal Indian village in that region. In 1749 there were 166 Indians connected with the settlement. On the breaking out of the French and Indian war in 1754 many of the Natick Indians enlisted against the French. Some never returned, and the others brought back an infectious disease which rapidly reduced the population. In 1764 there were 37 in the village and some others connected with it. In 1792 the whole body numbered but 25 or 30, and soon thereafter they had become so mixed with negroes and whites as to be no longer distinguishable. It was reported in Dec. 1821, that Hannah Dexter, 76 years of age, \"the last of the Naticks,\" had been murdered by her grandson at Natick.

A term formerly applied to several of the larger and more important tribes and confederacies in the Gulf states, particularly the Creeks, but also to the Cherokee, Catawba, Choctaw, and Chickasaw. At present it is an official term applied to each of the Five Civilized Tribes (q. v.) in Oklahoma, viz, the Cherokee, Creeks, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole. The term Les Nations was used by Canadian French writers of the 17th and 18th centuries (and occasionally in English writings) to designate the heathen tribes, who were distinguished into Les grandes Nations and Les petites Nations. The Riviere des petites Nations in the province of Quebec preserves this designation. Specifically Le petit Nation was the Weskarini, q. v. (H. W. H. A. F. c.)\n\nNATLIATIN\n\n[B. A. H.\n\nNational Indian Association. A society for improving the condition of the Indians. It originated in Philadelphia in 1879 with a memorial circulated by Mary L. Bonney and Amelia Stone Quinton petitioning the Government to prevent the encroachments of white settlers on Indian territory and to guard the Indians in the enjoyment of all the rights guaranteed to them on the faith of the Nation. A second memorial in 1880 obtained 50,000 signatures, and a third in 1881, signed by 100,000 persons, asked for all Indians common school and industrial teaching, land in severalty, and the full status of citizens. The association, formally constituted in 1880, and taking the name the National Indian Association in 1882, changing it to the Women's National Indian Association in 1883, was the first body of friends of the Indians to demand for them citizenship and lands in severalty. For these objects it labored till 1884, when missionary work was added, and since then it has established for 50 tribes or tribal remnants Christian missions, erecting more than 50 buildings, which when well established were given to the various permanent denominational missionary societies. A home building and loan department, a young people's department, libraries, special education for bright Indians, and hospital work were added later. The National Indian Association, which resumed its earlier name in 1901, has asked for more schools, an increase in the number of field matrons, the righting of various wrongs, and protection and justice to many tribes, and has constantly advocated the application of civil service reform principles to the entire Indian service, the gradual abolition of Indian agencies, the payment of debts due Indians from the Government, and other measures needed to prepare Indians for civilized self-support and good citizenship. Since 1888 the Association has published a periodical called Tlie Indian's Friend. (A. S. Q. ) Natkelptetenk (N'atqelptE/tEnk, 'yellowpine little slope').
