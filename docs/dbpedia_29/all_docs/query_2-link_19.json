        "text": "In 1789 George Washington’s Secretary of War Henry Knox announced his “civilization” policy in which the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, Cherokees, and Seminoles were encouraged to abandon their communal ownership of land and their traditional hunting and gardening traditions to become farmers and ranchers and to sell their lands for annual annuities. This policy was to become the basis for federal government-Indian relations for the next 150 years. It is also had untended consequences. In the lands between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River that had been ceded to Britain after the French and Indian War in 1763, King George established a Proclamation Line banning the American colonists from expanding settlement west of a Proclamation Line drawn down the Appalachian Mountains. This became one of the causes of the American Revolution, after which the northern states ceded lands north of the Ohio River to the federal government, which in turn established the Northwest Territory. In the Northwest Territory the federal government allowed White settlement and negotiated treaties establishing Indian reservations. The southern states, on the other hand, retained their claims to land west of the Appalachian Mountains allowing unrestricted White settlement in former Indian lands. Kentucky became a state in 1792, Tennessee in 1796, Mississippi in 1817 and Alabama in 1819. Thus, the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees and Creeks found themselves as sovereign nations within established states. In 1811 the Shawnee warrior and his brother The Prophet attempted to form a coalition of tribes in the Northwest Territory and the southeastern tribes to drive the Americans out of Indian lands. A faction of the Creeks known as the Red Sticks joined in the rebellion. The state of Tennessee sent Andrew Jackson to suppress the Red Sticks at Horseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa River in Alabama. The Creeks sought refuge in Florida, where they joined the Seminoles already there. Jackson followed up during the War of 1812 with incursions into Spanish held Florida to attack the Seminoles and the Spaniards. When Jackson was elected President of the United States in 1828, he supported the Indian Removal Act of 1830 forcing the five so-called five civilized tribes to migrate to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River in Oklahoma. The Cherokee under their paramount chief John Ross unsuccessfully tried to opposed the removal by legal suits, while the Seminole under Osceola fought a war against the forced removal. The removal cause a violent division between those who agreed to and those who opposed removal that continued in Oklahoma. During the colonial period, these tribes had been used to selling other Native Americans captured in warfare to British traders for resale in the West Indians (See, The Play-Off System). But when they abandoned their traditional hunting and gardening economies and became farmers and ranchers, the so-called Five “Civilized” Tribes also began to own African-American slaves like their White plantation owners. They brought their slaves to the Oklahoma Territory, and after the Civil War the question arose as to whether the former slaves would become members of the Creek and Cherokee tribes. The Dawes Act or General Allotment Act of 1887 established tribal rolls that excluded the former slaves. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907 the exclusion of Black Cherokees, Black Creeks, and Black Seminoles was incorporated into the state’s segregation laws.\n\n“Unlawful acts, performed long enough and with sufficient vigor, are never enough to amend the law.” So reads McGirt v. Oklahoma, the most important reservation boundary case in the history of the Supreme Court. But before McGirt, courts often rewarded unlawful acts with reservation diminishment. This Article first places McGirt in the context of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s century long fight to restore sovereign rights illegally denied after allotment, and the even longer fight by the Muscogee Nation and others to survive a trail of broken treaty promises. It then corrects the false assumptions about the past and present of reservation boundaries that led the Court to turn lawbreaking into law. As to the past, I show that the allotment-era Congress knew that reservations did not depend on land tenure, and that its statutes distinguished between allotment acts that diminished reservations and those that did not. States, however, regularly broke the law, asserting jurisdiction in violation of federal Indian law rules. Before McGirt, however, the Court falsely assumed that “[t]he notion that reservation status of Indian lands might not be coextensive with tribal ownership was unfamiliar at the turn of the century,” and so justified relying on state violations of tribal sovereignty as “evidence” of congressional intent. As to the present, I show that reservation status is not disruptive for non-Indian communities, and often benefits tribal and non-tribal citizens alike. In high-profile cases in Tacoma, Washington and Pender, Oklahoma, life in those communities began to improve at the same time reservation boundaries were affirmed. Throughout the country tribal governments contribute to the economies and social welfare of their surrounding communities. The Muscogee Nation, whose sophisticated law enforcement, health care, governance, and economic development arms already partner with non-tribal governments throughout its territory, exemplifies the benefits that strengthening tribal self-governance can provide."
