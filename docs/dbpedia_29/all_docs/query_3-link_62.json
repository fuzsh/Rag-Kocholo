Such rejected applicants shall also be advised that a new application may be submitted when the needed documentation of eligibility has been obtained.\n\nVII. LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP\n\nThere are two ways in which membership in the tribe may be lost. One is voluntary and is called relinquishment. The other is involuntary and is called disenrollment.\n\nA. Relinquishment\n\n1 . By an adult member - Any adult member of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana may voluntarily relinquish his/her membership. Such relinquishment must be in writing and the member's signature must be notarized. No formal action by any tribal body is required for the relinquishment to become effective. The enrollment officer shall note the date of the relinquishment (and the tribe which the member has joined, if that is the case) on the tribal roIl, notify the Tribal Council of the action, file the relinquishment form in the former member's folder and move the folder into the drawer designated for former members.\n\n2. By a minor member - The membership of any member of the Tribe who is not at least 18 years of age may be relinquished by his/her parent or guardian. The relinquishment must be in writing, and the signature of the parent or guardian must be notarized. The enrollment officer shall take great care to determine that the individual who signed the form has legal custody of the affected minor member. Then the minor's relinquishment shall be processed the same as one for an adult.\n\n3 . Forms and effective dates Any member desiring to relinquish shall be encouraged to do so on a conditional relinquishment form. In such case, the relinquishment shall become effective upon the acceptance of that individual into the membership of another tribe. The member's name shall not be removed from the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana's current membership roll until documentation of the acceptance into the other tribe's membership is received. Should a member insist upon relinquishing in writing without using the conditional relinquishment form, the tribe will comply with the member's wishes and remove the member's name from the current tribal roll with the effective date being the date the relinquishment was received by the enrollment coordinator.\n\n4. Membership after relinquishment An adult member who relinquishes his/her membership in the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana has permanently severed his/her ties with the tribe and shall not be permitted to rejoin the tribe. A minor member whose membership has been relinquished by a parent or guardian may submit an application for membership after he/she becomes 18 years of age. Such application shall be processed as though the individual had not previously been a member.\n\nB . Disenrollment: The burden of proof in disenrollment actions rests with the tribe.\n\n1 . Who may be disenrolled A tribal member shall be disenrolled when it is discovered that he/she\n\na. was erroneously enrolled in that he/she did not submit adequate documentation proving he/she met the constitutional membership criteria at the time of enrollment. This \"erroneous enrollment\" may have resulted from fraudulent submissions, mistakes in blood degree computations or inadequate research. NOTE: This provision does not apply to base enrollees, except for dual enrollment, i.e., those whose names appear on the official, approved membership roll on the date of the adoption of this ordinance, since they are, by definition, members without further test of eligibility.)\n\nOR\n\nb. is found to be currently enrolled with another Indian tribe and to have received benefits as an adult as' a member of the other tribe.\n\nOR\n\nc. is found to be currently enrolled with another Indian tribe who has not received benefits as an adult as a member of the other tribe and does not relinquish the membership in the other tribe within thirty (30) days of receipt of a certified letter from the Enrollment Officer informing him/her of the necessity to submit the required relinquishment\n\n2. Procedure for disenrollment A member identified as subject to disenrollment pursuant to the above sub-section shall be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the intent to disenroll. Included in the notice shall be the date set for a hearing before the Tribal Council to consider the matter. Following the hearing, whether or not the affected member makes any appearance or response, the Tribal Council shall determine if the member is to be disenrolled. Such decision shall be documented in a Tribal Council resolution. The disenrolled member shall be notified of the action taken by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall include the appeal rights outlined in section VIII of this ordinance.\n\n3 . Membership after disenrollment Persons who have been disenrolled may submit new applications for membership when adequate documentation of eligibility has been obtained. Such applications will be processed as though the individual had not previously been a member.\n\nVIII. Appeals\n\nA. Eligible appellants The following persons shall be eligible to file an appeal:\n\n1 . Any applicant who has been rejected for membership or\n\n2. Any person who has been disenrolled\n\nB. Timing of appeal Each notice of rejection or disenrollment shall provide that an appeal must be received within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the notice in order to be considered. The date stamped on the receipt of the certified letter shall be considered the beginning of that 30 day period.\n\nC. Filing of appeal The notice of appeal must be filed with the tribal court of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana. The date the appeal is received in the tribal court office shall be considered its date of receipt. An appeal must be in writing. No appeal may be filed by any form of electronic communication. Failure to file an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days shall waive any right to an appeal.\n\nD. Handling of appeal Upon receipt of an appeal, the tribal court shall obtain the appellant's file from the enrollment office for review. The tribal court shall set a date not less than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of the notice for a hearing on the appeal. The tribal court shall notify the appellant of the hearing by certified mail. This notice shall outline clearly again the basis for the rejection of the appellant's application or the basis for the appellant's disenrollment and shall inform the appellant of his/her right to be heard in person or by representation. This notice shall also inform the appellant that new evidence may be presented for consideration. Following the hearing whether or not the appellant makes any appearance or response, the tribal court shall document its decision by a court order and notify the appellant by certified mail of its decision. The decision of the tribal court shall be final.\n\nIX Records\n\nA. Contents of individual folders: An individual folder shall be established for each tribal member and applicant. The folder shall contain the following items:\n\n1. Application\n\n2. Family tree chart\n\n3. Birth Certificate\n\n4. Correspondence\n\n5. All other documentation on the person pertinent to membership\n\n6. Death Certificate\n\nB. Access to records\n\n1. The roll A listing of only the names of members may be viewed by any individual member of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana who comes into the tribal office. However, neither the roll nor any portion thereof may be copied and/or distributed to any person or organization except upon written permission of the Tribal Council. The Tribal Council shall exercise its discretion in using and/or releasing information from the roll for the benefit of tribal members or tribal programs.\n\n2. The folders Information in individual folders shall be considered confidential. It shall not be available to anyone except that individual member (or his/her parent or guardian) and to the enrollment officer, the Tribal Council and the tribal court when such examination is necessary in considering enrollment decisions.\n\n3. Special concern An adopted person's eligibility for enrollment is determined through one or both of the natural parents. Documentary evidence submitted to support an adopted person's application must show relationship to the natural parent through whom eligibility for enrollment is determined. The information concerning adopted persons shall be recorded as confidential and shall not be made available to any other person. This information shall be stored in locked file cabinets and adequate safeguards shall be installed to ensure that the confidentiality of these records shall not be violated.\n\nC. Updating records: Upon receipt of appropriate documentation, the enrollment coordinator is authorized to update the information on the tribal roll. The following documentation is deemed adequate for such actions to be taken:\n\n1 . Name change - Marriage license\n\nor Divorce decree\n\nor Court order changing name\n\n2. Address change - Written statement signed by tribal member over 18 years of age\n\nNotarized statement or affidavit stating custody of minor with address change\n\n3. Death - Death certificate\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs records\n\nMortuary records\n\nHospital records\n\nObituary notice from newspaper\n\nNotarized statement from an individual who attended the funeral or who saw the grave marker and can provide date of death\n\nAny change for which none of the above documents is available must be authorized in writing by the Tribal Council stating the reason for the change without usual documentation. A copy of that written authorization shall be placed in the individual's folder.\n\nX. Computing Degree of Tribal Blood:\n\nA. Initial Computation - Degrees of Coushatta Indian blood as, shown on the roll of the tribe at the time of the enactment of this membership ordinance shall be considered accurate unless or until a different degree of Coushatta Indian blood can be proven to the satisfaction of the Tribal Council. \"Coushatta Indian blood\" means Indian blood derived from a biological ancestor who was recognized as a member of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.\n\nB. Changing Blood Degrees - Once the degree of tribal blood has been recorded for a member on the tribal roll, it shall be changed only when the following procedure has been completed:\n\n1. Whenever a member requests a change in his/her blood degree the enrollment officer shall research the request. The enrollment officer is also authorized to initiate research into the accuracy of blood degrees shown on the tribal roll as time permits.\n\n2. If a determination is made by the enrollment officer that a member's blood degree has been erroneously computed, a resolution documenting the basis for the recommended change shall be prepared for Tribal Council action. If the Tribal Council agrees that the member's blood degree should be changed, it shall adopt the resolution authorizing the enrollment officer to make the change for the member and for all other persons affected by the change. Such a determination by the Tribal Council to change a degree of Coushatta blood shall be made only when the new blood quantum is established beyond a reasonable doubt either by submission of incontrovertible documentation or by presentation of a overwhelming preponderance of evidence. (NOTE: Although the degree of Coushatta blood shown on the tribal roll for a base enrollee may be corrected pursuant to this provision, such base enrollee shall remain a member of the tribe no matter what the corrected blood degree is.)\n\n3. All persons affected by the change shall be notified of the change by the enrollment officer. Any person whose blood quantum has been changed has the right to appeal pursuant to section VIII of this ordinance only if the change results in disenrollment.\n\nXI. Amendments:\n\nThis ordinance may be amended by the Tribal Council at any regularly called meeting at which a quorum is present.\n\nXII. Certificate of Enactment:\n\nWe, the undersigned, as Chairman and Secretary of the Tribal Council of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, do hereby certify that a quorum was present at a regularly called meeting of the Tribal Council on the 11th day of April 2000, and that the foregoing ordinance was enacted with the affirmative vote of 5 for, 0 opposed and 0 abstaining. Therefore, the ordinance is duly enacted and the date of this meeting shall be the effective date of the provisions of this ordinance.\n\n/s/\n\nLovelin Poncho, Chairman\n\n/s/\n\nHorace Williams, Vice Chairman\n\n/s/\n\nBertney Langley, Secretary - Treasurer /s/\n\nLeonard Battise, Member\n\nBack to Table of Contents"
