        "text": "Home | Research Center | American Indian Records | Timeline of Removal\n\nRemoval of Tribal Nations to Oklahoma\n\nTribal Nations in Oklahoma Before Removal\n\nIn 1803 when the United States assumed control of the area that became Oklahoma, Native peoples already inhabited the land. Wichita, Plains Apache (today’s Apache Tribe), Quapaw, and Caddo Nations were here during the Spanish and French colonial period.\n\nBy the early 1800s, the Osage, Pawnee, Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne, and Arapaho had also migrated into the region or visited to use resources. Some Delaware, Shawnee, Kickapoo, Chickasaw, and Choctaw regularly came to hunt Oklahoma’s abundant bison, beaver, deer, and bear.\n\nTribal Nations native to present-day Oklahoma region:\n\nCaddo\n\nOsage\n\nQuapaw\n\nWichita\n\nMaps of Tribal Nation Land\n\nThese maps depict the changes in tribal nation boundaries as nations were removed to present-day Oklahoma. Click on the icons below to view a larger map in PDF format.\n\nRemoval 1830–1862\n\nThe expansion of Anglo-American settlement into the Trans-Appalachian west led to the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, forcing all eastern tribal nations to move to new homelands west of the Mississippi River in the Indian Territory. The Five Tribes purchased new lands in present-day Oklahoma, but some relocated farther north. The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 led to renewed white settlement in these territories, and the immigrant nations located there were soon under pressure to move on. Texas, too, forced out all remaining tribal nations in 1859. The Civil War ended the removals temporarily.\n\nTribal nations removed or assigned reservations in the area:\n\nAbsentee Shawnee\n\nAlabama-Quassarte (Koasati)\n\nAnadarko (Nadaco)\n\nCaddo\n\nCatawba (moved voluntarily to Choctaw Nation)\n\nCherokee\n\nChickasaw\n\nChoctaw\n\nComanche\n\nDelaware, Western\n\nEastern Shawnee\n\nHainai\n\nKeechi (Kichai)\n\nKialegee\n\nMoingwena\n\nMuscogee\n\nPiankashaw\n\nQuapaw\n\nSeminole\n\nSeneca-Cayuga (including Conestoga, Erie)\n\nShawnee, Eastern\n\nTawakoni\n\nThlopthlocco\n\nUnited Keetoowah\n\nWichita\n\nYuchi (Euchee)\n\nThe Final Period, 1867–1892\n\nThe end of the Civil War allowed another surge of Anglo-American settlement into the West, and again tribal nations were pressured onto reservations in the Indian Territory. In 1867 many living in Kansas and Nebraska received new reservations by the Omnibus Treaty, while the Plains nations accepted reservations by the Medicine Lodge Treaty. The last people to receive a reservation were Geronimo and his fellow Chiricahua prisoners of war.\n\nTribal nations removed or assigned reservations in the area:\n\nApache\n\nApache, Lipan\n\nArapaho\n\nCheyenne\n\nPotawatomi\n\nComanche\n\nDelaware, Eastern\n\nFort Sill Apache\n\nIowa\n\nKaw (Kansa)\n\nKickapoo\n\nKiowa\n\nMiami (including Eel River Indians)\n\nModoc\n\nNez Perce\n\nOtoe-Missouria\n\nOttawa\n\nOsage\n\nPawnee\n\nPeoria (including Cahokia, Illinois, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Tamaroa)\n\nPonca\n\nSac and Fox\n\nShawnee\n\nStockbridge-Munsee\n\nTonkawa\n\nWaco\n\nWea\n\nWyandotte\n\nA Timeline of Removal"
