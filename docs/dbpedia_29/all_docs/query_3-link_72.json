        "text": "With 576 federally recognized tribes, Native Hawaiians and even more state-recognized tribes throughout the country there is a nearly limitless supply of moon names. Here are just a few:\n\nPlease note, the months below are rough approximations of when each moon will appear. The concept of months only occurred post-colonization and most of these tribal translations pre-date colonization and generally reflect the seasonality of lunar phases. Moon phases, in fact, were used as measurements of time.\n\nAlso, in the Mahican Dialect, ʔ signifies a glottal stop and ã is nasal tone, similar to the French aaaw.\n\nThe words and phrases in this post were provided by members of the various tribes listed and we offer our deepest thanks for all who assisted us with this story, with a special shout out to Gerry J. at Seneca Nation of Indians for going above and beyond.\n\nSpellings and translations may vary. Some words may be missing accents or symbols due to limited keyboard characters.\n\nWe’re happy to add additional languages and/or hear suggestions on spelling and translation corrections.\n\nPlease free to contact us at info@aianta.org to help us keep this page accurate."
