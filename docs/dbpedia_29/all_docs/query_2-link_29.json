        "text": "deadline.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDriving north on Interstate 49 through the heart of Louisiana, the terrain changes shortly past Bunkie. Prairies dotted with sprawling live oak trees and rice fields filled with crawfish buckets quickly turn to rolling hills and dense pine forests. Turn right at Exit 66 and the hills disappear, replaced by the flat alluvial plains of the Red River, where once plantations grew cotton and sugar cane as far as the eye could see. Head west from I-49 and the hills continue, the highway rolling through acres of what gardeners consider a Louisiana heaven.\n\nAt first glance, the town of Forest Hill appears as little more than a moment at a traffic light. Before visitors connect with U.S. Highway 165, another main thoroughfare to Lake Charles or Alexandria, they’ll spot the Forest Hill City Hall, the volunteer fire department, a small collection of businesses—including one bank and a barbershop—and a delightful municipal park with a pond at its center. A few streets over is the elementary school and the former high school’s gymnasium, now being used as a senior citizens center. Scattered here and there are the handful of churches and cemeteries tucked within the woods.\n\nAnd then there are the more than two hundred plant nurseries. Without the acres and acres of plant nurseries greeting visitors on the way into town, Forest Hill would just be another small, rural Louisiana town. Instead, it’s home to a multimillion-dollar industry. Even more surprising, the population of Forest Hill hovers near nine hundred residents, while the number of plant nurseries in the town and surrounding areas has been well over two hundred for at least a few decades. The recent recession took a small bite out of the trade, which saw its heyday in the ’80s and ’90s and depends largely on the housing industry, but business is still blooming in Forest Hill, a pun that’s routinely popular in newspaper and magazine headlines.\n\nForest Hill is nestled among the piney woods of central Louisiana. Cheré Coen.\n\nThe history of Forest Hill predates the nursery industry, with economics in the piney woods demanding constant reinvention. Small farmers and timber mill owners moved into the region in the nineteenth century, but the soil wasn’t as conducive to farming as the rich loam to the east near the town of Lecompte, where plantations were built on Red River floodplains and slave labor cotton drew a high price at market. Fortunes were made along Bayou Boeuf south of Alexandria, so settlement in the piney woods in and around present-day Forest Hill was slow to come by, except by hardy souls who started farms and plantation owners who visited the pine forests to escape the destructive fevers of summer.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the economy shifted for those growing cotton on Bayou Boeuf plantations, although prosperity for Forest Hill was still decades away. Where thoughts of taking advantage of the great virgin pine forests to the west had crossed minds in the early and mid-nineteenth century, ideas on milling these acres of opportunity only took shape with the advent of railroads and investors in the latter part of the century. Once the Kansas City, Watkins and Gulf Railway pushed through the area in 1892, establishing a depot at Forest Hill, a new era began. The prosperous timber industry roared through the piney woods as fast as a forest fire with this new avenue of shipping lumber to market, and in many ways it was just as destructive upon its conclusion. For years, jobs were plenty, and towns sprung up almost overnight to satisfy the sawmills and their ever-roaring blades slicing massive longleaf pine into lumber.\n\nIn 1897, Forest Hill officially became a town, with citizens working at a number of sawmills in the area, including the large Long Leaf complex and two major mills at McNary. Gravel pits began operating as well, and railroad spurs traversed the woods in all directions. It was an industrial complex, said Everett Lueck, president of the board at the Southern Forest Heritage Museum, located just outside Forest Hill.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, the timber was spent, acres in all directions clear-cut and devoid of the majestic longleaf pine trees. With the elimination of forests came the abandonment of the lumber companies, many packing up shop and leaving the region, if not Louisiana. Forest Hill residents were forced to regroup, return to farming or head to the gravel pits.\n\nOne entrepreneur, Samuel Stokes, had a better idea. A lover of plants and nature, Stokes found interesting species in the piney woods near his home, plants such as rare dogwoods, camellias and azaleas. He taught himself horticulture and learned to graft, propagating the central Louisiana native plants first for his own enjoyment and then to sell to others. He discovered pansies and ways to grow hundreds of the colorful flowers on his property for an eager market throughout the country. Within years, Stokes had a booming nursery business.\n\nForest Hill residents also found new opportunities with the Civilian Conservation Corps, which arrived to alleviate the devastation to the soil brought on by unregulated timber practices. A state fish hatchery was built, and tourists visited the area’s watering holes, such as Shady Nook, and fishing meccas Indian Creek Dam and Cocodrie Lake. In the meantime, Stokes taught others his nursery business, residents such as Baker Taylor, Billy Mitchell and the Poole brothers (Murphy Archie Poole and Hayden Johns Poole Sr.); the industry slowly began to grow.\n\nBy 1940, the economy of Forest Hill—and Rapides Parish—had shifted again. Troops training for combat in World War II came roaring through the region much like the timber industry had done, with 500,000 troops visiting the temporary military base of Camp Claiborne just a few short miles north of Forest Hill from 1940 to 1946. The town enjoyed prosperity instantly, feeding off the military base and its temporary inhabitants until, like the loss of virgin forest, the soldiers were gone.\n\nOnce again, Forest Hill was forced to reinvent itself, and it found its stride in a new and exciting venture. Residents began working for the Stokes and the Poole Brothers Nurseries, learning the trade and opening their own nurseries in turn. New generations came along to take their parents’ places, branching out like a genealogy tree and marrying into other nursery families.\n\nThe Central Louisiana Association of Nurserymen was organized to promote networking and cost-saving measures among the nursery owners, and the growing industry started attracting nursery distributors and other associated businesses.\n\nBy the 1980s, Forest Hill owned a thriving plant nursery industry, one that inspired the Louisiana legislature to label it the Nursery Capital of Louisiana. Plants grown in Forest Hill traveled throughout Louisiana and its surrounding states, with some sold as far as the East Coast, and many ended up on shelves of big-box stores such as Lowe’s, Home Depot and Walmart. Every spring, thousands would flock to the piney woods town for the popular Louisiana Nursery Festival.\n\nThe great American success story continued with the Hispanic community of Forest Hill, workers who arrived from Mexico as seasonal workers to fill a labor shortage, learned the trade and opened their own nurseries, much as the early Forest Hill residents had done.\n\nToday, the success story that is Forest Hill lines Highways 112 and 165, pouring into neighboring towns such as Glenmora, Woodworth, McNary and Lecompte. Even nurseries located in adjacent parishes have ties to the horticultural town, connected to one another through a unique sharing of business. Some nurseries such as Stokes date back one hundred years or more, while others are newcomers to the trade.\n\nThe small town of Forest Hill, Louisiana, contains and is surrounded by more than two hundred plant nurseries. Cheré Coen.\n\nAt first glance, Forest Hill appears as another miniature, rural Louisiana town nestled in the state’s piney wood forests. Children attend the local elementary, parents deposit their money at the Red River bank branch and residents pay their municipal bills at the small windowed office at city hall. On Sundays, voices raise up in a handful of churches.\n\nJust behind the small-town façade, however, lies a massive green industry, its rows of woody ornamentals, trees and flowers branching off from the center of town for thousands of acres into the horizon.\n\nAs the headlines sporting puns note, Forest Hill is a bloom town.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Early Settlement of Forest Hill\n\nIt’s difficult to name the original inhabitants of the Forest Hill area. Most of the American Indians who resided in Rapides Parish fall into several original tribes before European settlement and a diverse set when Europeans drove the first inhabitants westward. The tribal makeup changed constantly.\n\nWith the coming of the Europeans, Indians in the area around the [Red River] rapids were pushed westward and replaced by other Indians pushed from points further east, wrote Sue Eakin in Rapides Parish History. Finally, only clusters of Indians in small villages stayed around the curves of the Bayou Boeuf and along Indian Creek or in the vicinity of Glenmore until they too moved out of the area sometime during the early years of the nineteenth century.\n\nEakin names Pascagoulas, Caddoans in the northern hill country of the parish and the Avoyel tribe to the south around Marksville in Avoyelles Parish as original native groups living in Rapides Parish. Some historians claim that a band of Choctaws lived in the Appalaches Village in what is now Zimmerman, as well as in a line south/southeast to Pine Prairie. Louisiana historian G.P. Whittington cites an early French official’s claim that the Chickasaws took advantage of travelers when the Red River rapids were at their worst, that a tribe of Attakapas lived to the south and east of Lake Cocodrie and that Choctaws arrived in central Louisiana sometime in the eighteenth century, with a small tribe established on Bayou Beouf.¹ The Yowani Choctaws were believed to have lived in central Louisiana as early as the mid-1750s, eventually moving from a village on Bayou Chicot into the Clifton community. Other sites of Choctaw settlements were believed to have existed at Boyce, Flatwoods, Clifton Crossing, Hineston, Seiper Creek and Woodworth.²\n\nCocodrie Lake, south of Forest Hill. State Library of Louisiana.\n\nThe Biloxi Chatot, and other Pascagoula and Yowani began moving to lands along Bayou Rapides and Bayou Boeuf in the late nineteenth century, according to the authors of The Historic Indian Tribes of Louisiana. The Alabama and some Choctaw had established settlements near Chicot and Cocodrie, in present-day central Louisiana, and the Pacana settled near present-day Elizabeth, on the headwaters of the Calcasieu River. The authors also claim that the Choctaws displaced some native tribes in the region, such as the Adai west of Natchitoches, and took up residence south of Bayou Boeuf near Indian Creek at Woodworth and Glenmore.\n\nThe Choctaw lived in the lowlands and later moved to Indian Creek (near Lecompte), Hicks and Zimmerman, wrote Don C. Marler in Historic Hineston. These Indians were thought to be Yowani Choctaws.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt included a series of reports called the Louisiana Writers Project. Louisiana writers traveled throughout the state, documenting histories of communities and people and compiling collections of folklore, legends and oral histories. One account focused on Ashton Plantation, located west of Lamourie and northwest of Lecompte, only a few miles from Forest Hill. \"Ashton plantation is a part of the Miller and Fulton land acquired from the Pascagoula, Appalachi and Alabami Indians in 1802. Some of these Indians were known to have lived around Lemourie [sic] prior to 1783. Relics of an Indian village have been found on this property in recent years.\"³\n\nAnother account claimed that a tribe of friendly Choctaws lived in the vicinity of present-day Forest Hill along Spring Creek and Hurricane Creek and down toward Lake Cocodrie. These Choctaw Indians cultivated small fields of corn and made split cane baskets, dyed in bright colors, which were sold in Alexandria. They also sold game and deer skins. The deer skins which they dressed were of a superior quality and it was generally believed that the Indians used a secret formula for curing the buck skins.⁴\n\nPerhaps the best-known record and a first-person account of American Indians living in the Forest Hill area comes from Solomon Northup, a free man of color who wrote a memoir of being kidnapped and sold into slavery to a central Louisiana plantation owner. In his book Twelve Years a Slave: Narrative of Solomon Northup, a Citizen of New York, Kidnapped in Washington City in 1841, and Rescued in 1853, Northup described the tribal members he met in the woods near Indian Creek, where his owner, William Prince Ford, operated a sawmill:\n\nIndian Creek, in its whole length, flows through a magnificent forest. There dwells on its shore a tribe of Indians, a remnant of the Chickasaws or Chickopees, if I remember rightly. They live in simple huts, ten or twelve feet square, constructed of pine poles and covered with bark. They subsist primarily on the flesh of the deer, the coon, and opossum, all of which are plenty in these woods. Sometimes they exchange venison for a little corn and whiskey with the planters on the bayou. Their usual dress is buckskin breeches and calico hunting"
