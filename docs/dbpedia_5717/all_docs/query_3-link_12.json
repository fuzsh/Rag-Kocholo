        "text": "A&R representatives spend the majority of their time listening to music, scouring clubs, reading blogs, watching social media, and tracking industry buzz on the hunt for promising new musical artists. At smaller organizations, A&R reps act as an artist's link to the company and are responsible for signing the artist, guiding the artist's subsequent career, and representing the artist's interests within the larger organization. At most major labels, however, these duties are handled by A&R managersâ€”the next step up the ladder.\n\nLike many in the music business, A&R representatives work unpredictable schedules, including seeing a lot of live music, listening to mountains of demos, spending time with artists, and attending to business in the office.\n\nIn addition to their great ears, A&R representatives rely on a finely tuned and constantly evolving understanding of current music tastes and trends to identify acts with talent, drive, buzz, and more. It's their job to concretely understand what to others is mysterious: the confluence of qualities and circumstances that makes an artist a contender for commercial success. Historically, members of A&R departments have wielded great power as the industry's tastemakers and gatekeepers; as a result, the A&R representative is one of the most coveted and competitive jobs in the record industry. This is still true today, despite the major shifts in the record industry caused by the internet, which also led to a slight decline in the influence of A&R departments."
