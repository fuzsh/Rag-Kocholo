        "text": "RIAA is the trade organization that supports and promotes the creative and commercial vitality of music labels in the United States, the most vibrant recorded music community in the world. Our membership – which includes several hundred companies, ranging from small-to-medium-sized enterprises to global businesses – creates, manufactures and/or distributes sound recordings. In support of its mission, the RIAA works to protect the intellectual property and First Amendment rights of artists and music labels; conducts consumer, industry, and technical research; and monitors and reviews state and federal laws, regulations, and policies. RIAA also certifies Gold®, Platinum®, Multi-Platinum™, Diamond and Los Premios De Oro y Platino™ sales and streaming awards.\n\nSee what it takes to be an RIAA member, and view the latest list of RIAA members (U.S. record companies that pay dues directly to RIAA) as well as record companies that have content distributed (“distributed labels”) by major recorded music companies (“majors”) in the U.S.\n\nRead more about our board, which is comprised of executives from a variety of indie and major record labels, as well as our RIAA leadership team.\n\nThe music industry is rich with organizations dedicated to ensuring that artists and recording companies are compensated fairly for their work, and getting their work into the hands of the people who matter most—music fans.\n\nThe RIAA prides itself on being a fun and exciting place to work. It is also an excellent environment for students to learn about the music industry and intellectual property."
