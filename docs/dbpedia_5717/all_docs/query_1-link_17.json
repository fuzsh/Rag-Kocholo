        "text": "A WORLD-WIDE JOINT VENTURE WITH SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT\n\nPalm Tree Records, co-founded by Kygo and his manager Myles Shear, is a worldwide joint venture with Sony Music that prides itself on community and culture. The label’s mission is to become the premier destination for artist development on a global scale. From its inception in 2018, Palm Tree Records has established a proven track record in cultivating engaged and ever-growing fan bases for its artists through innovative storytelling, meaningful collaborations and creative marketing. It aims to provide a full-service experience for artists who want to be at the epicenter of music culture, selling hard tickets and merchandise for their core audience.\n\nThe company’s holistic approach to artist development positions itself more as a strategic partner than as a traditional record label. This style, while unorthodox, acts as a catalyst for helping artists construct a well-balanced, full-bodied business led by a multitude of revenue streams: streaming, touring, radio, merchandise, publishing and more. The label takes pride in its transparency, accountability and familial culture to establish a united dynamic with its artists. To date, Palm Tree Records has garnered nearly one billion streams across 175+ releases.\n\nKygo (Co-Founder)\n\nNorwegian DJ and producer Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll, better known as Kygo, has become an international sensation in unprecedented time. The globe-trotting star became the fastest artist to reach one billion streams in 2015 and has since gone on to accrue over ten billion streams worldwide. From selling out arenas across Europe and North America to headlining premier festivals, including his own, Kygo’s success is continuing to build to greater heights. The musical prodigy has partnered with household brands like Puma, Coach and Bumble under the Palm Tree Crew entity he has co-founded with Myles Shear. \"At Palm Tree Crew, we are building a next-generation lifestyle company that brings our fans incredible experiences and offerings all over the world. Our vision is to create unforgettable moments and opportunities that reflect our mission to promote connection, fun, innovation — and of course, the tropical lifestyle.”\n\nKygo (Co-Founder)\n\nNorwegian DJ and producer Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll, better known as Kygo, has become an international sensation in unprecedented time.

Our vision is to create unforgettable moments and opportunities that reflect our mission to promote connection, fun, innovation — and of course, the tropical lifestyle.”\n\nMyles Shear (Co-Founder)\n\nMyles Shear’s meteoric rise in the entertainment industry began in 2012 when he co-founded EDMSauce, a media outlet that quickly became influential in the dance and electronic music space. However, it was his signing of soon-to-be global phenomenon Kygo that rocketed Shear’s career into the upper echelon. In December 2015, the artist became the fastest artist in history to reach one billion streams on Spotify thanks to his signature tropical house sound. Fast forward to present day with Palm Tree Crew — an entertainment, hospitality, and investment holding company — where Shear and Kygo have built an empire together that taps into music festivals, apparel, food and beverage companies and more. In January 2024, it was announced that Palm Tree Crew had closed a new round of funding at a $150M valuation. \"From the start, our vision has been to build a one-of-a-kind lifestyle company that provides our customers with access to unique experiences and products that embody a carefree, luxurious tropical way of life…We are only getting started.\"\n\nMyles Shear (Co-Founder)\n\nMyles Shear’s meteoric rise in the entertainment industry began in 2012 when he co-founded EDMSauce, a media outlet that quickly became influential in the dance and electronic music space.
