        "text": "Hi @sub_conscious,\n\nThanks for posting in the Spotify Community, and welcome!\n\nOne way that you can find artists, albums, and songs released by a particular record label is by entering “label:” followed by the name of the record label, in Search.\n\nNote that if you’re using the desktop app and the record label has more than one word in its title, you will need to enter dashes instead of spaces in your Search term.\n\nFor example, you can find music released by the Heavy Psych Sounds record label through this search:\n\nlabel:heavy-psych-sounds\n\nYou can also read about more tips regarding Search in this support article.\n\nIn addition, there is a Closed Idea in the Idea Exchange that you may be interested in voting for, about an option to view other releases published by the same record label as a release on Spotify. While the status of this idea is currently “Closed - Not Enough Votes,” it can become an active idea again if it gains sufficient votes.\n\nIf this idea is something you’re interested in, I recommend adding your +VOTE to it; the more votes an idea gets, the likelier it is that Spotify will implement it, and you can read more about how feedback on ideas reaches Spotify here. It will also be useful for you to Subscribe to the idea by clicking the three dots next to its title; that way, you can be sure to be informed of any relevant updates.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, and have a good day!\n\nAdamDamSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nHi @sub_conscious,\n\nThank you for your reply!\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment there isn’t a way to view all the releases from a record label in chronological order.\n\nI recommend adding your +VOTE to the similar Closed Idea that I shared in my previous post; and you can add a comment to it with your suggestion for this potential feature to show a record label’s catalog in chronological order. The more votes an idea gets, the likelier it is that Spotify will implement it, and you can read more about how feedback on ideas reaches Spotify here.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, and have a good day!\n\nAdamDamSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee."
