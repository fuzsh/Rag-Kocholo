        "text": "I was born and raised in theocratic Iran, a country where the government denied my existence as a gay man. (Remember, “There are no gays in Iran.”) As a young gay boy coming of age in a conservative society and struggling with my sexual orientation, I was constantly bullied in high school. I was labeled the Farsi equivalents of a sissy and a f****t, and was an outsider with absolutely no friends. I didn’t see a future for myself as a gay man since I was pushed away and ostracized. I ached to belong to a group or community, but I didn’t belong to any. My family and relatives didn’t know the true me, and society didn’t want anything to do with someone like me. For a long time, I thought that I was the only person in the world who was gay. I never had an openly LGBTQ representation or role model to look up to and see myself in them, and I never thought I would see the day after tomorrow when “it will get better.” Those were lonely and dark times for me.\n\nOn Feb. 3, when Pete Buttigieg was sworn in as the youngest secretary of transportation and as the first openly LGBTQ Cabinet member in U.S. history, I was once again reminded of the necessity and power of representation. I find his selection and its positive consequences extremely important and thrilling. For the first time, an intelligent, successful, and hardworking person is representing our community in such a capacity on the national stage.\n\nFrom the day Pete Buttigieg ran for the Democratic presidential nomination I’ve gotten into multiple arguments about him with several of my dear friends. These friends are very strong advocates for inclusivity and had the luxury of coming out to very understanding families and friends. Their coming of age as LGBTQ individuals was a smoother process, and they had many out role models and representations to look up to. However, they believe Secretary Buttigieg running as the first openly gay candidate for the highest office in the nation, and his confirmation as the first openly gay Cabinet member are not important. (Editor’s note: Fred Karger is the first openly gay man to run for president. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.) In fact, they find it shocking that a majority of the LGBTQ community is celebrating these milestones. Their arguments mostly revolve around the following two issues:\n\n1) They believe he is not a good representative for the LGBTQ community because he lives a “heteronormative” lifestyle. They are using the same labeling mechanism that we reject as discriminatory, hateful and divisive against our community, to reject Secretary Buttigieg and his successes.\n\nA) Who are we to judge others’ lifestyle and life choices? Isn’t that exactly the kind of judgement we as a community have suffered from for generations?\n\nB) What is so heteronormative about a man who is married to another man anyway?! We claim to be a community of very diverse members. We have LGBTQ pastors, sex workers and everything in between. We have polyamorous open relationships, married monogamous couples with children and so much more in between. So why is it that suddenly Secretary Buttigieg doesn’t deserve to have a space on this wide spectrum that we call our LGBTQ family? He considers himself a cis man who doesn’t paint his nails but shares his last name with his husband. Why are his lifestyle and life choices and the individual that he is, fake and just a “show to get the support of as many straight and conservative people as possible?” Yet other lifestyle options in our family are genuine and real?\n\n2) My friends believe Secretary Buttigieg’s achievements are not significant and not worthy of celebrating because they are the outcome of his “white privilege,” and “he doesn’t acknowledge or recognize that privilege enough.” They have decided to generalize against a portion of our community and based on that generalization punish some of the members of our LGBTQ family for who they are. In this case, it’s Secretary Buttigieg, who was born in a white family.\n\nA) I don’t think it is right nor fair to attribute every single achievement of a white person completely to their white privilege. This is as wrong and misguided as is denying the existence of white privilege.\n\nB) We know that white privilege exists. Secretary Buttigieg himself has acknowledged it many times in several interviews and public engagements, for example, in his April 2019 interview with Trevor Noah. What is the solution for white privilege? Is it to punish the people who were born into it and strip them off of their achievements, even though we cannot quantify how much of their success was due to white privilege? Should all white people publicly acknowledge their white privilege several times a day for us to forgive them? Or is the solution looking at their current actions and beliefs to see how they address the issue of white privilege, how they lift up people of color, and then holding them accountable?\n\nC) It is not a mystery that almost all of the first doors in this country were opened by white people. On top of white privilege, and aside from the first doors that were opened by non-white people and in history were recorded for white individuals, white people are statistically still the single largest racial group in the U.S. (census.gov states more than 60 percent as of 2019.) So simply based on the rule of probability, white people are more likely to open more doors first. Yes, I wish a Black, brown or even olive LGBTQ person was the first openly LGBTQ member of the Cabinet. However, now that they are not, does this mean we should not acknowledge and celebrate the importance and significance of what Secretary Buttigieg has achieved? A door has been opened by a great individual, and this means that hopefully down the road many LGBTQ people of color will be able to follow him. As a marginalized community, any form of advancement for one of us is an advancement for the whole community and vice versa.\n\nIn my opinion, these negative attacks on Secretary Buttigieg are hypocritical and a double standard and are in no way helping or advancing any of our causes. We ask the larger society not to label or ostracize us, but then within our own community we do it so brazenly. Sadly, we are labeling ourselves out of the very inclusivity that we yearn for and claim to cherish.\n\nWe truly need to believe in inclusivity and commit to it. Adding letters and signs to “LGBTQ,” or adding colors to the rainbow flag or putting slogans on t-shirts are all beautiful for social media, but they do not do the work. We need to do the work, starting with ourselves.\n\nEach of us has a story, and that story is valid. No one knows the details and corners of that story, but there is a lot more to us than what others see. Throwing a blanket on a group of people and treating them all the same comes from a very simplistic point of view and ignores the unique and valid story that each of us has. We need to be better than those we complain about.\n\nFor now, let’s wish the representative of our large and diverse family great success and celebrate what this means to younger LGBTQ people who live in not so friendly places around the country and around the world, and to those who at nights go to bed lonely and scared and in the morning wake up hopeless and sad.\n\nThree years have passed since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban continues to arrest LGBTQ Afghans one after another, and punishes them in public in front of people and local Taliban authorities across the country. There is no news about their fate. And the severity of repression and increased violence against LGBTQ people by the Taliban has, unfortunately, been away from international attention and their situation is deliberately ignored.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Taliban over the last three years has published several rulings regarding the punishment of LGBTQ people for “lawat,” a reference to sexual relations between two men in Sharia law, and most punishments of LGBTQ people has taken place in public in five provinces: Kabul, Parwan, Sarpul, Zabul, and Kandahar.\n\nA court in the Saidkhel district of Parwan province on July 1 announced it had tried and punished four people for “lawat.”\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Taliban in a newsletter said the Seyed Kheli district’s primary court sentenced three defendants to a year in prison and 39 lashes. Another defendant received a 2-year sentence and 39 lashes.\n\nThe Taliban in June publicly punished dozens of LGBTQ people in Sarpul, Parwan, and Kabul provinces.\n\nSome of the LGBTQ people who the Taliban freed from their prisons told the Rainbow Afghanistan Organization that they were subjected to sexual exploitation, gang rape, and all kinds of torture, including electric shocks, physical beatings, and fingernail removal that caused severe pain and suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, the spreading of hatred and the issuing of harsh punishments for LGBTQ people by the Taliban is not hidden from public view. The Taliban, for example, continues to execute LGBTQ people by toppling walls on top of them.\n\nThe Taliban in May 2023 published a declaration that emphasized the implementation of Sharia law in Afghanistan. The Taliban issued dozens of final verdicts of “Islamic retribution and ‘hudud’” (“hudud” are Islamic penal codes under Sharia law) and punishments that included stoning. Four people were reportedly executed when walls fell on to them.\n\nGul Rahim, a Taliban judge, told the German newspaper Bild in July 2021, just before Afghanistan fell, there are “two punishments for homosexuals: Either stoned, or they have to stand behind a wall that falls on their head. The height of the wall should be 2.5 to 3 meters.”\n\nThe Taliban used this method to punish LGBTQ people when they were in power between 1996-2001.\n\nTaliban member Mohammad Khel said on Afghanistan International TV on March 28, 2024, that those who are of two sexes — and it is not clear whether they are male or female — should be killed immediately, should be killed tomorrow, and should have been killed yesterday. He continued the program host’s answer, and said he is a Muslim and the Quran has ordered him to kill. The Supreme Court of the Taliban two days before the interview ordered the flogging and punishment of an LGBTQ person in Khaf Sefid district in Farah province for “lawat.”\n\nLGBTQ people have always been excluded from U.N. Security Council declarations and resolutions, despite the Taliban’s public punishment of LGBTQ people and the Taliban’s increased violence against them.\n\nEach Security Council resolution — Resolution 2679, and Resolution 2721 — the U.N. Security Council adopted over the last three years has ignored LGBTQ Afghans.\n\nWe, the LGBTQ community of Afghanistan, see the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has adopted this wrong approach, which has completely excluded the experiences of LGBTIQ people in its human rights reports from 2021 until now. This omission in UAMA reports for the past three years shows gender-based violence that LGBTQ Afghans face is being ignored.\n\nThe U.N. has unfortunately not adopted any new, more inclusive approaches in the implementation of its resolutions, declarations and meetings for Afghanistan; despite Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International’s declarations and concerns to the U.N. and the international community regarding the unfortunate situation of LGBTQ people and women in Afghanistan and requests to pay more attention to it. The U.N. and the international community always excludes a vulnerable group — such as the LGBTQ community, which experiences the most violence in Afghanistan and has been sidelined and ignored for years from all resolutions and declarations — and deliberately ignores their situation.\n\nThe U.N., the U.N. Security Council, and UNAMA’s disregard for the unfortunate situation of LGBTQ Afghans is a slap in the face to the concept of human rights in Afghanistan.\n\nLGBTQ Afghans today are bewildered that the same international community that championed free elections and LGBTQ rights is willing to compromise its own moral values to cave in to an extremist ideological group that represents an armed clerical regime that has established gender apartheid in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban have succeeded in silencing the voices of LGBTQ people in Afghanistan by using repression, violence, torture, and punishment in public. The U.N. and others in the international community have given this opportunity to the Taliban and their supporters by ignoring the situation of LGBTQ people, by silencing the voice of the Afghan LGBTQ community outside of Afghanistan.\n\nWe, and Afghanistan’s LGBTQ community are deeply concerned about the Security Council and UNAMA’s neglect of these serious violations. We believe that what is happening in Afghanistan is a clear example of gender apartheid and human crime.\n\nWe condemn every U.N. meeting, declaration, and resolution on Afghanistan that excludes the LGBTQ community. We consider it a violation of the human rights charter.\n\nAli Tawakoli is an Afghan LGBTIQ rights activist and director and founder of the Rainbow Afghanistan Organization.\n\nKamala Harris has found the right person with whom to share the stage — someone who joins her in bringing some joy to America. Americans are looking for truth, and a positive look toward the future. I don’t think most Americans believe any candidate is perfect. But those who may be struggling want to elect someone who will tell them the truth, along with giving them hope for a better future. I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are those candidates. It is amazing to feel the flow of positive energy since Harris began her campaign, and that has only increased since she introduced Walz as her running mate.\n\nIt was Walz who used the word joy to describe Harris at their first joint rally in Philadelphia — a rally that had the kind of positive feeling we have not seen in politics for a long time. It seems to have set the tone for how the campaign will be run. Harris has this beautiful smile, to back up her brilliance, and Walz clearly likes to joke around even when talking about a serious subject. Together they manage to leave people smiling, even in these sometimes really difficult times. This is not to say they don’t fully appreciate the seriousness of the issues the nation, and the world, are facing. But it seems they can talk about them, telling people the truth, without adding all the lies and doom and gloom, the Trump MAGA team seems unable to keep out of their campaign.\n\nThe issues in this election are clear. There are the kitchen table issues so important to everyone. The cost of food, rent, gas, education. Harris understands this, and supports a Democratic response to these issues. She will never deny peoples’ struggles, but explains how the Trump response of cutting taxes for the rich, and placing tariffs on all imported goods, will only make things worse. She makes it clear her doing something about climate change will be better for this, and future generations, than Trump’s denying climate change, and putting his head in the sand. He has even told oil producers if they bribe him with enough money, he will let them drill for as much oil wherever they want.\n\nWhen it comes to the cultural issues, Harris believes we must guarantee everyone their equal rights, and personal freedom, and do so as a nation. Trump believes it’s OK for states to deny women control of their body, and deny the LGBTQ community its rights, and to make it harder for the African-American community to vote. Trump even packed the Supreme Court with justices who agree with him. One of the highlights of the Harris/Walz Philadelphia rally was when Walz talked about abortion rights and the rights of the LGBTQ community, and said the Minnesota golden rule in dealing with your neighbor on these issues is “Mind your own damn business.” Walz is the happy warrior; someone who could be introduced at the convention with the old Democratic theme song, “Happy Days Are Here Again.” He was born on a farm in Nebraska, is a hunter and fisherman, enlisted in the National Guard, is a superior marksman, and served 24 years in the military. He understands guns, and supports the Second Amendment. But at the same time he understands weapons of war like AK-47s don’t belong on our streets with the potential of killing our children in their classrooms. Maybe that comes form his being a teacher, and coach, for 20 years before going into politics. He volunteered to be faculty adviser to the Gay/Straight Alliance in the high school where he taught at a time when that was as difficult as Trump wants to make it again today.\n\nWhen Walz spoke of IVF, he talked from the personal experience he and his wife had. Their struggle to have a child and then when their daughter was born, they named her Hope. I assume all women, and most men there, understood what he meant and knew he really cared.\n\nSo, when I say Harris and Walz have brought honesty and joy back to politics, it is because of who they are as people, and what they stand for. When she talks about Trump and the crowd yells ‘Lock him Up,’ she stops them and says, let the courts decide that, and moves on.\n\nI believe their positive campaign will lead to more people coming out to vote. They will do so, because they see a brighter future ahead and they will vote for Democrats for that brighter future.\n\nPeter Rosenstein is a longtime LGBTQ rights and Democratic Party activist. He writes regularly for the Blade.\n\nWhat’s with Peter Rosenstein’s endorsement of Rachel Macha for Rehoboth Beach Commissioner? Did he realize she’s a MAGA Republican who is a Florida resident? Did he know she was running against a gay candidate? I thought he was supposed to be a Democratic and LGBTQ activist. I guess I can cut him some slack since he doesn’t vote in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nI have been involved in Rehoboth Beach elections in the recent past when I was a non-resident voter, including the two previous times Macha ran for commissioner. Each year I publicly challenged Macha for her lack of transparency, inexperience, unpreparedness for meetings and her conflict-ridden personality. She reminds some of us of Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nLike most Republicans, she seemed to favor the development community over the interests of the citizens.\n\nFortunately, since Macha lost badly for the third time in last Saturday’s election, I am happy voters saw through all this. Maybe she will now take her public service to Trump’s favorite state.\n\nAs for Rosenstein, let’s not forget that he is one of the people responsible for ending the political career of the LGBTQ community’s beloved ally Carol Schwartz. Readers should remember that when evaluating his future endorsements.\n\nJeffrey Slavin is mayor of Somerset, Md.\n\nPeter Rosenstein responds:\n\nI thank Jeffrey Slavin for taking the time to write to the Blade about my endorsement of Rachel Macha. As he said, she did lose, but I have no regrets about endorsing her. Slavin attacks Macha as he has in the past and he was wrong then, and wrong now. I didn’t criticize any of the gay candidates running. I am not even sure which one, or ones, was gay, and didn’t mention the name of another candidate in my endorsement. I guess I missed his endorsement of any of the candidates he supported. He clearly knows how to reach the Blade, and I hope he knows they are always open to having people write endorsements for the candidates they support. As I am sure he understands, the Blade very rarely endorses, and that is why they make it clear any endorsement is from the writer of the column.\n\nNow one thing that I know is untrue is that Rachel Macha is not a MAGA Republican. Slavin has been saying that about her for years. The first time I endorsed her for an office was during the presidential campaign of 2020. In that campaign I asked each of the three candidates I was endorsing who they were supporting for president. I told them I would mention that in the column. They all, including Macha, said they endorsed Joe Biden, and I reported that in the column. I supported her along with Hugh Fuller, owner of the Purple Parrot, and Paul Kuhns for mayor, because of their stances on local issues including supporting keeping Clear Space Theatre in Rehoboth and other issues many members of the LGBTQ community in Rehoboth care about. This time many members of the LGBTQ community joined in endorsing Macha. I guess Slavin missed the fundraiser for her held at Aqua Grille.\n\nSlavin decided to throw into his letter about the Rehoboth election, some nonsense about me being responsible for Carol Schwartz’s loss in a D.C. election years ago. I had to chuckle at that, as he gives me credit for being very powerful. He neglects to mention that back in 1994, Carol Schwartz was the only Republican I ever voted for. Not only did I vote for her, but I was one of three people, including her son, who wrote her platform when she ran against Marion Barry for mayor. He was trying for his fourth term as mayor.\n\nI congratulate the winners of the election in Rehoboth Beach and hope they will work to keep Rehoboth as great as it’s always been. While not a voter in town, I have owned a place in Sussex County for more than 26 years, and have been involved in the City of Rehoboth for more than 40. I hope to continue to be involved, and if asked, will always consider endorsing candidates I think are good for the city. Again, in future elections, I hope to read in the Blade a column from Slavin, endorsing the candidates he likes."
