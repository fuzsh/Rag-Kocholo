        "text": "A quitclaim deed (sometimes misspelled “quick claim”) is used when someone gives up (waives or disclaims) ownership rights in favor of another person. The grantor may or may not be on the current deed. A quitclaim deed is often used in divorces or inheritance situations, when a spouse or heir gives up any potential rights to real estate. The grantor is giving up their own rights, if any, but not promising anything else.\n\nThere are many other types of deeds, such as warranty deed, joint tenancy deed, easement deed, trust deed, etc. In some states, these may be considered separate deed types, but in California, these are usually just customized grant deeds.\n\nIn a warranty deed, the grantor promises to pay for any lawsuits or damages due to undisclosed ownership disputes. In California, title insurance usually covers such disputes.\n\nOther types of deeds, such as joint tenancy deeds, corporation deeds, easement deeds, or mineral rights deeds, can be created by customizing our grant deed format by downloading the RTF (word processing) version from our website. Consult an attorney or come to the Law Library to research appropriate wording.\n\n3\n\nDetermine How New Owners Will Take Title\n\nIf there is more than one new owner, you are moving the real estate into or out of a trust, or the new owner is married, the form of title can have important effects.\n\nOne, unmarried owner: leave blank\n\nIf there is only one new owner, and that person is unmarried, title can usually be left blank, although it doesn’t hurt to state something like “a single person” or “a widow” or the like.\n\nMore than one owner, owners not married: “Tenants in common” or “joint tenants”\n\n“Tenants in common” (When one dies, their heirs get their share; probate may be needed. Shares do not need to be equal. Any owner can sell or mortgage their portion.)\n\n“Joint tenants” (When one owner dies, the other(s) gets their share automatically. Shares must be equal. Any owner can sell or mortgage their portion, but it turns the title into tenants in common.)\n\nIf you leave this blank, the default is “tenants in common.”\n\nExamples: siblings who inherit property together, business partners, couples who are not married or registered domestic partners (DP).\n\nOwners are married couple: “Community property,” “community property WROS,” or “joint tenants”\n\n“Community property” (Both must agree to sell or mortgage the property. At death, a share goes to the surviving spouse/DP and another share to heirs. This will probably require at least a summary probate.)\n\n“Community property with rights of survivorship (WROS)” (Both must agree to sell or mortgage the property. At death, 100% goes to surviving spouse/DP, with no requirement of probate.)\n\n“Joint tenants” (When one dies, the other(s) gets 100%. Shares must be equal. Either spouse/DP can sell their portion. May receive less favorable tax treatment when first spouse/DP dies.)\n\nIf you leave the title line blank, or fill in something like “as husband and wife” or “as domestic partners,” it will be treated as “community property” and a share will go to any heirs instead of all to the surviving spouse/DP.\n\nOwner is married, but property not shared: “as sole and separate property”\n\nIf only one spouse/DP owns the property (because that person already owned it when they got married, or it was a gift or inheritance), they can make that clear by using the phrase “a married man/woman/person as his/her/their sole and separate property.” Note: if any money earned during the marriage is spent to purchase, make mortgage payments, maintain, or improve the house, the community owns a share regardless of what it says on the deed.\n\nProperty is being transferred into or out of a trust\n\nMany couples use trusts to hold their property. The contents of a trust are technically owned by the trustees. Therefore, when transferring property into a trust, the grantees are the “[name of trustees], as trustees of the [name of trust] dated [date trust was signed].”\n\nWhen transferring property out of a trust, the grantors are the trustees, identified the same way.\n\nSee “Forms of Title for Multiple Owners,” below, for examples of how these are entered onto the deed.\n\nYour choice of title can have many effects later, such as when you sell or refinance, if one owner falls into debt, if one owner dies, or if a couple divorces. Some examples of potential effects are:\n\nreassessment of property raising annual property taxes (since 2022, parent-child transfers are no longer always immune);\n\nhigher capital gains taxes when an owner sells;\n\nhow the property is divided in a divorce;\n\nwhether the property can be liened or foreclosed on for one of the owners’ debts;\n\nineligibility for benefits such as Medi-Cal;\n\ndifficulty refinancing if one owner has bad credit;\n\nlack of eligibility for a reverse mortgage.\n\nIf you have questions about which form of title to use, talk to a family or estate lawyer or research your options at the law library.\n\n5\n\nGrantor(s) Sign in Front of a Notary\n\nThe notary will charge a fee for this service. You can find notaries at many banks, mailing services, and title companies.\n\nThe new owners do not need to sign.\n\n6\n\nFill Out the Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR)\n\nThe PCOR is required when property changes hands, to update the tax records. Turn it in at the Recorder’s Office along with the deed. You can download a Sacramento version of the PCOR from Cal Assessor e-Forms. Each county has its own version; contact the assessor’s office in the county where the property is located to obtain the proper form.\n\n7\n\nRecord the Deed and File the PCOR at the Recorder’s Office\n\nThe Recorder’s Office charges a recording fee (currently $20/first page plus $3 for additional pages). Current Sacramento fees are available at the County Clerk/Recorder’s website. You may also need to pay the Documentary Transfer Tax or a $75 “Building Homes and Jobs Act” fee.\n\n8\n\nFile Reassessment Exclusion Claim, if any, at the Assessor’s Office\n\nWhen property changes hands, it is reassessed for tax purposes, often causing a sizeable increase in property tax for the new owner.\n\nCertain transfers are excluded from reassessment, including:\n\nParent to child or child to parent (“Prop 58 Exclusion” for deaths before 2/15/2022, “Prop 19 Exclusion” for deaths after 2/15/2022)\n\nGrandparent to grandchild (but not vice versa) (“Prop 58 Exclusion” for deaths before 2/15/2022, “Prop 19 Exclusion” for deaths after 2/15/2022)\n\nTransfers between spouses or registered domestic partners during marriage or as part of a property settlement or divorce\n\nChanges in method of holding title that do not change ownership interests (for instance, changing joint tenants into tenants in common)\n\nIf your transfer is excluded from reassessment, you may need to file a claim with the County Assessor. For more information in Sacramento, call the Assessor’s office (916‑875-0750) or visit the Sacramento Assessor’s office website.\n\nWhen property changes hands, the county charges a one-time tax of $.55 per $500 of the value of the real estate (1.1%). Some kinds of transfers are exempt. If yours is exempt, enter the Revenue and Taxation code that provides the exemption, and an explanation, then sign. If yours is not exempt, calculate the dollar amount and write it in.\n\nCommon exemption codes and explanations:\n\nGift (transferring property, or adding name to property, without compensation):\n\nCode: “R&T 11911” Explanation:“Gift.”\n\nLiving Trust (transfer into or out of revocable living trust):\n\nCode: “R&T 11930” Explanation: “Transfer into or out of a trust”\n\nName Change (confirming name change after marriage or court-ordered name change):Code: “R&T 11925” Explanation: “Confirming change of name, the grantor and grantee are the same party.”\n\nConveyances in dissolution of marriage:\n\nCode: “R&T 11927” Explanation: “Dissolution of marriage.”\n\nOther exemptions may be available. See the list of “Transfer Tax Exemptions” on the Sacramento Recorder’s website.\n\nGrantor(s): The current owner or person transferring the property rights or part of the property rights. This is the person or people who will sign this deed.\n\nGrantee(s): List all people who are receiving property rights from the grantor(s). If the grantor is staying on title, be sure to list the grantor’s name as one of the grantees also.\n\nIt’s often helpful to include the grantors’ and grantees’ marital status.\n\nIf you change your name (by court-ordered name change, marriage, or divorce), deeds made out to your old name should be updated. Make out a new grant deed from yourself ([new name], who acquired title under the former name [old name]) as Grantor to yourself ([new name]) as Grantee. For example:\n\nIn some situations, after a property owner dies, a new owner receives the property without having to go through probate, just by recording an affidavit. Common examples include people who own the property together as joint tenants or community property with right of survivorship, and people who inherit property via a transfer on death (TOD) deed. For more information, see our guide on Affidavits of Death: Transferring Property without Probate.\n\nThe new owner removes the prior owner from the deed by filing an Affidavit of Death of Joint Tenant, Affidavit of Surviving Spouse, or Affidavit of Death of Transferor under TOD Deed.\n\nThis is legally sufficient to change ownership, but the lack of a deed showing the new owner’s name can be confusing and lead to problems when selling or refinancing the property. The new owners can make the chain of title (history of ownership) clearer by recording a Grant Deed showing themselves as the Grantee. Here’s how:\n\nFill out a standard Grant Deed for the property. The new owner will list themselves as both the Grantor and the Grantee. For example, if Chris Jones was a surviving joint tenant on property, after they recorded an Affidavit of Death of Joint Tenant, they could fill out a grant deed like this:\n\nThis is the full description of the property, not just the address. It may be brief or very long and full of legalese. It must match the current deed exactly.\n\nYou may want to photocopy the legal description and attach it to the new deed as an exhibit, especially if it is too long to fit on the page.\n\nIf a piece of real estate is part of a probate case, once the case is resolved the personal representative (executor or administrator) must record documentation showing that it is now owned by the heir or heirs. They can either:\n\nrecord a certified copy of the judge’s Order for Final Distribution, or\n\nrecord a deed from the personal representative to the beneficiary.\n\nBecause the Order is bulky and may have personal and financial information, recording a deed is often preferred. The deed must reference the legal description of the property, the county and case number of the probate case, and the date and title of the order authorizing distribution, state that there is no representation, warranty, or covenant of any kind, and be signed by the personal representative “as executor or administrator of the Estate of ________.”\n\nHere is example wording of a Deed to Real Property that can be customized to fit your needs. The sample is worded for a probate that includes a will. If your situation does not include a will, you would state that you are “administrator of the estate” instead of “executor of the will.”"
