        "text": "Google matches up to $10,000 in donations per employee each year.\n\nOne of the highlights of Googleâ€™s match program is that the company not only matches personal donations to nonprofit organizations, but it also matches money employees personally raise for charitable events that they actively participate in, such as walks, marathons, or bike rides.\n\nGoogle offers grants to nonprofits where employees volunteer. The company offers low barriers to participation by only requiring employees to volunteer one hour to secure funding.\n\nNonprofits that use the 360MatchPro Volunteer Hub can provide a search plugin for volunteers to research their eligibility. The platform makes it easy to find forms and guidelines needed to turn volunteer activities into extra funding for worthwhile causes.\n\nThrough the Google Ad Grants program, Google supplies eligible nonprofits with $10,000 in free funding to use on its paid advertising platform. Since 2003, Google has donated over $10 billion in free advertising to more than 115,000 nonprofits across 51 different countries.\n\nApplicants undergo an eligibility check and application process. Once approved, they can create ads targeting the search terms their prospects are searching for online. Hereâ€™s an example of a Google Ad from Claireâ€™s Place Foundation, which supports people and families affected by Cystic Fibrosis:\n\nNonprofits can promote any page that supports their mission, helping them to:\n\nBoost donations by amplifying donation forms and specific fundraising campaigns\n\nAttract volunteers by highlighting upcoming opportunities\n\nPromote upcoming events to local audiences\n\nEstablish themselves as thought leaders by promoting educational mission-related content\n\nBest of all, the grant automatically renews each month. Given the complexity of routine account maintenance, many organizations partner with expert Google Grants managers to create ads and monitor performance.\n\nWe recommend Getting Attention. This agency is a verified Google Partner, meaning Google has vetted them to ensure theyâ€™re trustworthy and understand the program. They can walk you through your application, identify the best keywords, create compelling ads, and keep your account in compliance with the program rules. Basically, theyâ€™ll handle the heavy lifting, helping you communicate your mission as effectively as possible.\n\nGoogle for Nonprofits offers free tools designed to streamline nonprofit management and amplify impact. Eligible organizations can access Google Workspace, including professional email addresses at your nonprofitâ€™s domain, 100 TB of storage, and video meetings for up to 100 participants.\n\nNonprofits can also join the YouTube Nonprofit Program, which provides perks like donation buttons on videos and access to free lessons. If you want to apply for Google Ad Grants, youâ€™ll need a Google for Nonprofits account anyway, so take advantage of all the tools that come with it.\n\nEvery Bank of America employee is eligible to request up to $5,000 per year in matching gift funds to nearly any organization.\n\nBank of Americaâ€™s matching gift program will match donations made to nonprofit organizations up until March 31st of the following year. That means that your organization has plenty of time to make a last-minute end-of-year appeal or start-of-year appeal to remind your donor base to submit match requests.\n\nSince 1954, GE has been known as one of the top companies that donates to nonprofits.\n\nWhile GE initially only matched employee donations to colleges and universities, the company has expanded its match program to include nearly all nonprofits.\n\nIn early 2024, GE split into 3 companies: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare, and GE Vernova. All have matching gift opportunities.\n\nWhile GE Aerospace and GE Vernova employees can have donations ranging from $1 to $5,000 matched, GE Healthcare employees can have donations from $25 to $10,000 matched.\n\nBy revenue, BP, a London-based oil and gas company, is the fifth largest company in the world, and they share their wealth accordingly.

Through the Fabric of America Fund, BP even allows employees to request up to $300 for their nonprofit of choice without donating or volunteering. BP employees can submit requests for this grant while on the company intranet.\n\nCollectMore is State Streetâ€™s matching gift program for fundraising. Through CollectMore, State Street will match their employeesâ€™ fulfilled pledges up to $10,000 annually.\n\nCollectMore is part of a three-pronged program for financial giving, which also includes GiveMore, their matching gift program, and DoMore, their volunteer grant program.\n\nThrough GiveMore, employees can get up to $10,000 in donations matched per year, senior VPs are eligible for $20,000, executive VPs are eligible for $30,000, and board members, CEO, president, and vice chairs are eligible for up to $40,000. State Streetâ€™s DoMore program allows employees to request a $500 grant for every 16 hours they volunteer with a nonprofit.\n\nChevron is committed to promoting sustainability, whether thatâ€™s through more traditional environmental protection efforts or by supporting diversity, economic development, education, health, and human rights.

Individuals can earn up to $5,000 in combined matching gift and volunteer grant donations per year for their cause of choice.\n\nDependents of employees up to the age of 26 are also eligible to participate in the volunteer grant program.\n\nCarMax also encourages CarMax employees to volunteer together through their Volunteer Team-Builders program. For example, employees can earn $500 from CarMax for their cause of choice by hosting a donation drive or volunteering in a group of 5-24 employees.\n\nDuring IMFâ€™s annual giving campaign, they will match employee donations to most nonprofits.\n\nEmployees and retirees can donate directly through payroll deduction or make a one-time payment.
