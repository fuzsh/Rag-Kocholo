        "text": "Google matches up to $10,000 in donations per employee each year.\n\nOne of the highlights of Google’s match program is that the company not only matches personal donations to nonprofit organizations, but it also matches money employees personally raise for charitable events that they actively participate in, such as walks, marathons, or bike rides.\n\nGoogle offers grants to nonprofits where employees volunteer. The company offers low barriers to participation by only requiring employees to volunteer one hour to secure funding.\n\nNonprofits that use the 360MatchPro Volunteer Hub can provide a search plugin for volunteers to research their eligibility. The platform makes it easy to find forms and guidelines needed to turn volunteer activities into extra funding for worthwhile causes.\n\nThrough the Google Ad Grants program, Google supplies eligible nonprofits with $10,000 in free funding to use on its paid advertising platform. Since 2003, Google has donated over $10 billion in free advertising to more than 115,000 nonprofits across 51 different countries.\n\nApplicants undergo an eligibility check and application process. Once approved, they can create ads targeting the search terms their prospects are searching for online. Here’s an example of a Google Ad from Claire’s Place Foundation, which supports people and families affected by Cystic Fibrosis:\n\nNonprofits can promote any page that supports their mission, helping them to:\n\nBoost donations by amplifying donation forms and specific fundraising campaigns\n\nAttract volunteers by highlighting upcoming opportunities\n\nPromote upcoming events to local audiences\n\nEstablish themselves as thought leaders by promoting educational mission-related content\n\nBest of all, the grant automatically renews each month. Given the complexity of routine account maintenance, many organizations partner with expert Google Grants managers to create ads and monitor performance.\n\nWe recommend Getting Attention. This agency is a verified Google Partner, meaning Google has vetted them to ensure they’re trustworthy and understand the program. They can walk you through your application, identify the best keywords, create compelling ads, and keep your account in compliance with the program rules. Basically, they’ll handle the heavy lifting, helping you communicate your mission as effectively as possible.\n\nGoogle for Nonprofits offers free tools designed to streamline nonprofit management and amplify impact. Eligible organizations can access Google Workspace, including professional email addresses at your nonprofit’s domain, 100 TB of storage, and video meetings for up to 100 participants.\n\nNonprofits can also join the YouTube Nonprofit Program, which provides perks like donation buttons on videos and access to free lessons. If you want to apply for Google Ad Grants, you’ll need a Google for Nonprofits account anyway, so take advantage of all the tools that come with it.\n\nEvery Bank of America employee is eligible to request up to $5,000 per year in matching gift funds to nearly any organization.\n\nBank of America’s matching gift program will match donations made to nonprofit organizations up until March 31st of the following year. That means that your organization has plenty of time to make a last-minute end-of-year appeal or start-of-year appeal to remind your donor base to submit match requests.\n\nSince 1954, GE has been known as one of the top companies that donates to nonprofits.\n\nWhile GE initially only matched employee donations to colleges and universities, the company has expanded its match program to include nearly all nonprofits.\n\nIn early 2024, GE split into 3 companies: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare, and GE Vernova.
