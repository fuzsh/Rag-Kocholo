        "text": "shesaid.so is a global independent community of women and gender nonconforming people in the music industry.\n\nWhat started as a passion project by Andreea Magdalina in London in September 2014, has since evolved into the largest independent communities in the music business.\n\nThe shesaid.so community consists of women, gender nonconforming people and ALLIES from all sectors of the music industry: from record labels, artist management companies, and booking agencies, through to technology platforms, creative agencies, composers, artists and more. With headquarters in London and LA, shesaid.so has 18 global chapters around the world including NYC, France, Italy, and Mumbai to name a few. A majority of our members are decision-makers in their fields and we are increasingly welcoming more and more young people to the network as well.\n\nOur mission is to connect and empower underrepresented communities towards a more equitable music industry for all, one woman or gender nonconforming person at a time.\n\nIntersectionality is paramount to us - we acknowledge that, in the past, feminist movements advocated for the rights of the privileged few [white affluent women] and we are committed to building a future that does not carry with it mistakes from the past. We recognize the compounded challenges that further marginalized groups of women face, in addition to their gender, due to race, sexuality and/or sexual identity, cultural nuances, faith, ability etc.\n\nWe are unwavering in our intersectional approach to women’s rights and we urge the entire music community to adopt a similar outlook.\n\nWe curate and speak on panels that discuss important industry matters and aim to inspire our hosts and guests alike. We organize interactive events for our members and extended network, as well as showcases that shed a light on talented female artists and their representatives. We challenge the industry’s outdated systemic framework with our Alternative Power 100 Music List and work towards increasing the number of women and gender nonconforming people who progress in their careers with our mentoring program we.grow. We work with brands to produce events and campaigns that further our mission of equality, diversity and inclusion."
