        "text": "“Music enhances dining experiences at every food and beverage operation in Massachusetts, a major component in creating the unique atmosphere every operator envisions when opening his/her location. BMI has been a terrific advocate within the MRA family in helping our operators understand and appreciate music licensing, while at the same time offering them a generous partnership discount. In addition, BMI’s philanthropic industry support is critical to supporting the MRA’s mission.”\n\n— Stephen Clark, President & CEO, Massachusetts Restaurant Association (BMI Partner Since 2004)\n\n“Our members receive a discount due to our partnership with BMI. This savings drops right to the bottom line and provides needed expense reduction while ensuring all guests have access to high-quality music. We value our long-term partnership with BMI and their commitment to our Association and members.”\n\n— Dr. Emily Williams Knight, CEO, Texas Restaurant Association (BMI Partner Since 2000)\n\n“As Managing Director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin representing almost 5000 bars and restaurants, I am grateful to have BMI as a partner to help navigate the music licensing world. We rely on BMI for information, advice to help our members, and resolution to issues as they arise. I appreciate all the help and support that we receive from their staff.”\n\n— Karie Krantz, Managing Director, Tavern League of Wisconsin (BMI Partner Since 2000)\n\n“BMI has been an honest broker and reliable partner with the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association for years. They do an excellent job of humanizing the sometimes-fraught issue of music licensing for our members, showcasing the talent they develop, and answering the difficult questions that often come. In this, they stand alone amongst their peers in the industry.”\n\n— Justin L. Winslow, President & CEO, Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association (BMI Partner Since 2002)\n\n“FRLA has enjoyed working with BMI for decades on events like the Key West Songwriters Festival – now the largest in the world – and rebuilding tourism after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, expanding music festivals and events throughout our state. We are so proud to have a strong partnership and great FRIENDSHIP with BMI as we promote music and tourism across Florida.”\n\n— Carol Dover, President & CEO, Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association (BMI Partner Since 2000)"
