        "text": "Evicted photos by Nolasco Giovanni Photography.\n\nA sense of home and place is an essential human right. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) makes multiple references to both the physical and emotional need for belonging and safety, from the right to shelter to free movement and residence. However, for millions in the United States and around the world, access to a safe, reliable, and permanent home remains out of reach. Those displaced by conflict, discrimination, or economic instability are forced to leave their homes and seek safety and opportunity in places they often have never been. Similarly, marginalized communities often see their homes vulnerable to governmental neglect, violence, and environmental degradation.\n\nEvicted is on view from January 18-March 10, Thursdays-Friday, 12-6 p.m. and Saturdays-Sundays, 12-5 p.m. No reservations or tickets are required, feel free to drop in to see the show at our offices at 625 N. Kingsbury St, Chicago, IL 60654.\n\nYour support helps us promote housing as a human right. Any donations made for Evicted will be matched dollar-for-dollar up to $5,000 by our generous sponsor, btcRE LLC! Double your impact by giving today. Can’t make it in to see the exhibition? You can still make a donation!\n\nJames has always had a natural talent for singing. James spent 15 years in prison and upon his release he was in a car accident that left him with extensive physical therapy. This accident was the catalyst for a series of events that led him to become houseless. He describes the Red Line Service, which he became involved with two years ago, as a blessing, as they connect him to services and support. James continues to share his love for music, particularly favoring love ballads. James showcased his singing talent in Cabinet of Curiosity's Outloud! Outspoken! performance on October 1, 2023.\n\nVenturing into the world of acting, James participated in the Chicago International Puppet Theatre Festival's Puppet Lab, performing in a 9-night show of \"Consuewella Triptych in MOVE\" by Jacqueline Wade from June 1-11, 2023. Puppets were a new and exciting experience for him and he thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to try different and new things.\n\nJames can relate to the struggles depicted in \"Evicted\" as he has experienced eviction and public housing firsthand. His unique perspective allows him to share stories and insights about the challenges faced by people in similar situations, having witnessed evictions in his own neighborhood and family. During his time in prison, he not only learned to play the keyboard but also became one of the head chefs, earning high honors and pursuing a degree in culinary arts. He shares that his music was a source of solace and calmness for fellow inmates.\n\nToday, James finds joy in working with children, a passion he discovered after joining a church upon his release from prison. A pastor encouraged him to form a children's choir, and he discovered a deep connection with kids. Smart, charismatic, and street-wise, James easily relates to children, engaging in sports, teaching, and sharing his life experiences with them. James loves being a father to his 5-year-old daughter, Jamyah.\n\nJames would like people to know that he needs help finding an apartment and has been houseless for three years now despite countless social service workers promising to help and support him.\n\nTransitioning from dull skates found in an alley to mastering the edges, Efren now enjoys his role as a skate host, welcoming visitors, providing assistance, and ensuring a smooth experience on the ice. During the summer, Efren loves cycling, participating in group rides to promote health through exercise, cyclists rights and sharing the road.\n\nBeyond the rink and the bike trails, Efren engages in event facilitation at Red Line Service, where he introduces new participants to the world of art. Hosting events that expose those experiencing homelessness and housing and food insecurity to artistic activities, Efren witnesses the power of art in people's lives and how many people think art isn’t for them prior to trying it out. He actively participates in watercolor and printmaking and has collaborated with the University of Miami School of Law Human Rights Program and Red Line Service to create impactful banners and slogans addressing houselessness. Efren emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue of housing for societal well-being.\n\nEfren's connection with animals extends to dog walking and sitting, a venture that began with a chance encounter in the Gold Coast. What started as a spontaneous act of friendship turned into a recurring role of caring for pets and homes. Efren's involvement with Red Line Service since 2019 underscores his dedication to using art as a tool for change. He believes that providing homes is a crucial step toward a better society.\n\nRobert Scott\n\nRobert is deeply connected to public housing communities in Chicago. He currenly serves as the Vice Chair of the Central Advisory Council and President of the Senior North Advisory Council. In this capacity, he represents and advocates for over 6,000 seniors residing in 23 different public housing complexes on the north side of the city.\n\nHaving lived in public housing since 2009, Robert currently calls Maria Diaz home. His roots trace back to the West Side of Chicago where he grew up as a self-proclaimed \"plain old guy.\" Robert is a proud Vietnam veteran and senior citizen who finds joy in his roles as a devoted husband and a father to his two adult sons, Elliot and Marcus. Robert is also an active participant in various aspects of community life including being part of a bowling league and Chicago Vikings, a motorcycle club composed entirely of seniors that traverse the open roads across the county.\n\nThrough his roles in various advisory councils, he actively works to address the needs and concerns of the seniors he represents. According to Robert, the importance of the Evicted exhibition lies in its ability to shed light on issues that affect not only Chicago or specific demographics but diverse individuals across the nation. Robert wants visitors to have access to essential information about eviction and knows that people and organizations are fighting on their behalf.\n\nThis exhibition is a partnership between the National Public Housing Museum, ART WORKS Projects, we all live here, Red Line Service, and the Chicago Housing Justice League. Evicted is supported by a generous grant from the Avangrid Foundation. The exhibition is organized by the National Building Museum, where it was made possible by gifts from Amy Falls, Ford Foundation, and the Wells Fargo Housing Foundation. The Illinois tour is made possible by the Illinois Office to Prevent and End Homelessness and the Supportive Housing Providers Association.

In 2014, the complex was purchased by a development firm with promises to renovate the units and temporarily relocate residents during construction. It’s now 2022, and few steps have been taken to fulfill those promises.\n\nThis project aims to amplify the voices of Forest Cove residents in hopes that it will evoke tangible improvements to their situation. While documenting the apparent disparities at Forest Cove is integral to this story, it’s equally imperative to highlight the spectrum of humanity and resilience of the residents. To be able to find joy, to smile and be positive, to take pride in their home while fighting for change is indicative of true resilience.\n\n“I chose to document this story because I felt that it needed to be told, but not told by just anyone. It needs to be told with care and humanity, by someone who has the residents’ best interests, someone who is willing to be thorough and cover all bases, someone who looks likes them.”\n\n– Mark Anthony Brown, Jr.\n\nAlthough this story is about a specific group of people living in a specific place, these images shed light on the types of severe housing disparities faced by many communities throughout the United States and beyond.\n\nAs a part of the exhibition, the NPHM presents “It Felt Like Home,” a curated selection from the oral histories of current Forest Cove resident, Felicia Turner and former resident of the Thomasville Heights Projects and current Relocation Advocate at Forest Cove, Gino Turner.\n\nReyes' open letter to neighbors said, in part:\n\nI want to share with you this recent work I made for NPHM. I hope that both sides of this poster will remind you that your voice is important and that it is crucial to continue to show up in this broken world. I hope this work offers you the strength you need to take resolute action towards justice for all.\n\nPlease, take it to the polls, mail it in, vote!\n\nJen told us why she wanted to work on this project for the museum and she said:\n\n“The election is one of the only things that I can focus on, it is incredibly high stakes and will have wide reaching impacts. During my work this year with NPHM I have been thinking a lot about what it means to be a neighbor, and how that relates to the mission of the organization. I connected this idea of what it means to be a neighbor to our actions in this upcoming election and how our action or inaction impacts those around us felt like a perfect fit, especially since I am an immigrant in this country. As a Canadian and neighbor from the north I can't vote in this country yet I am deeply impacted by the results. For the poster that I mailed out along with a letter encouraging recipients to vote I called in the words of poets June Jordan and Mary Oliver, reminding readers that their voice is important and that it is crucial to continue to show up in this broken world and work for justice. Poetry is deployed as a call to action, as fuel for social movements, and as respite and sustenance to continue on.”\n\nWhen the international distress signal SOS was adopted in 1908, its easily recognizable and unique code produced aural unity, a sense of calm in life or death situations. As the world adjusts to new norms in challenging times, SOS Color Code 2020 offers a reconsideration of how language, objects and symbols, and even color can help us find stable ground and safety no matter where we are. Situated in specific public and domestic settings, during the crucial time leading up to the US Election, SOS Color Code 2020 reminds us, as US Representative John Lewis said, “Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.”\n\nLuftwerk is the artist collaboration of Petra Bachmaier and Sean Gallero. With space as their canvas, they transform environments into immersive experiences. Since founding in 2007, Luftwerk has amassed a significant body of work ranging from site-specific installations to experimental projects that interpret data. In each project they are interested in the abilities of how light and color can be utilized to shift perception and enhance experience. http://luftwerk.net/\n\nNormal is a multi-disciplinary graphic design practice based in Chicago. Normal believes thoughtful design and collaboration strengthens our collective knowledge and defines new ways of seeing, communicating and experiencing the world. Normal is Renata Graw, Tim Curley & Noël Morical. https://thenormalstudio.com/\n\nHome can mean many things to many people. It’s the place where you rest your head, the table where you eat family meals, it’s the place where we have difficult conversations, painful experiences, and joyous celebrations. These memories are the ordinary, everyday activities that make up life At Home.\n\nAt Home is a projection installation, which acts as an ephemeral monument for the everyday lives and stories of public housing residents.\n\nDo monuments matter? Must they be forever carved in granite and steel? Who is worthy of monumentalization and who gets to decide?\n\nAt Home is an artistic attempt to address some of these questions through projections that will begin in Chicago at the last remaining building of the Jane Addams Homes and future home of the National Public Housing Museum. Stories are being collected and added to the At Home collection, and future versions of the monument with different stories will travel all over the United States at sites of significance to those who live or have lived in public housing.\n\nOn view\n\nThe pilot monument will be on view October 7-10 (7-9pm) at 1322 W Taylor Street (Chicago). Come witness the first iteration of At Home from the street or sidewalk during the allotted viewing times. Social distancing and masks are required.\n\nOn October 7 (7-9pm) follow NPHM (@the_nphm) on Instagram to view the monument from home.\n\nLivestream\n\nOn October 8 (7-8pm) join NPHM on YouTube for an interactive virtual conversation with some of the artists, historians, and storytellers who contributed to this monument and to learn how public housing residents can get involved.\n\nEVENTBRITE\n\nDo you live in public housing? Have you ever lived in public housing?\n\nShort 3-sentence stories will continue to be collected and added to an online database. Submissions will be collected through the project website: www.athomemonument.org. Visitors to the website will be able to see documentation of the projection installation(s) and the collection of narratives as text."
