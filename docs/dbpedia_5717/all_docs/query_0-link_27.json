        "text": "Lest you are to be led astray, this is not a map of some of the hottest season’s worthy drinking establishments in a city near you. No, this thing basically wrote itself on the heels of an impressive string of new exceptional hip-hop exploits, all released within short succession as we enter everyone’s favorite time of the year. The list is limited to eight selections dropped between May and July (yes, there’s a bit of a season’s cheat in there). It’s eight because that is also New York Knicks‘s small forward OG Anunoby’s official jersey number, whom a day after the uprising Manhattan franchise acquired Mikal Bridges from across the East River—reuniting La Cosa Nova from their Villanova Wildcats college heydays—reportedly came to terms with the pending free agent on a five-year contract worth more than $210 million.\n\nSo as June winds down, and Spike Lee celebrates the 35th anniversary of his critically-acclaimed joint Do The Right Thing via a block party on the very same street the film was shot in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, we would have been remiss not to elevate these superlative rap records. Kicking this whole thing off with marquee Detroit rap group Slum Village’s first new album in almost a decade, F.U.N. The J Dilla-surviving outfit’s tenth studio LP came out at the very beginning of May, but might in fact be the most true blue summer record of all in this batch. Faithful to its titling acronym—admittedly containing multitudes—the 12-track project packs a slew of sticky and immediate killers, no fillers; most of them disguising conscious lyrical urgency with disco dancey flows, as well as uplifting beats in earnest. F.U.N. is immaculately produced, its sound lavish and glossy, and if one’s to pass judgement on substance, nearly all of the songs hold quite a lot of compositional water too.\n\nA tastefully handpicked line up of guests—including Larry June, Cordae, Karriem Riggins, and Robert Glasper—carefully elevates the sonic palette across the half hour of unhinged slappers on the project, without ever taking the boat out too far for the exploit to not have the usual Slum Village trademark stamp on it. Yes, the cover art is inexplicably ghastly and boyish, something you’d rather expect landing on a crestfallen young adult book sleeve, than on the Michigan veterans’s long awaiting comeback joint—but hey, it’s not like Slum Village have anything left to prove to anyone in the game at this point. This summer, expect to hear some of these numbers on the airwaves of any hip-hop stations that do the right thing.\n\nMoving on, just a week after F.U.N., on the 10th of May 54-year-old rap game statesman Ghostface Killah saw fit to grace us with his twelfth solo studio project, Set the Tone (Guns & Roses): and boy it’s an adorned banquet ready for feast. Earmarked and distributed by Nas‘s influential imprint Mass Appeal, the album features co-sign appearances from fellow Wu Tang Clan peers Method Man and Raekwon, as well as Busta Rhymes, Kanye West, and the label boss himself—amongst many others. Unlike Slum Village’s neatly packed and focused thirty minutes of new material, Set the Tone is more bloated, pushing a full hour of runtime across its nineteen records (although four are interludes). Yet, its highlights are infectiously undeniable, like the New York City meeting of the mob minds on “Scar Tissue“, the gentle and sultry “Plan B” (featuring a standout vocal performance by Harl3y), or the silk sonic achieved on “Touch You“—tastefully interpolating the classic 00s R&B benchmark “Let Me Love You” by Mario.\n\nShamefully, the project seems to have flown a tad bit under the radar of most, and has left critics and mainstream fans alike largely unfazed. But not around here. This thing is a bona fide flawless exercise in feel good hit of the summer hedonism and excess. Stuffed with optimism, charisma, and flamboyance for good measure. Do not let this slip by you just because it’s not on your TikTok For You Page. Speaking of music that isn’t on your FYP, but definitely should, our third rec takes the impressionistic painting brushes and its inherent conceptualism up a few notches, courtesy of North Carolina-native Rapsody. Issued seven days after Ghostface’s exploit—yes, early May was stacked fam—Please Don’t Cry is the Roc Nation recording artist’s fourth full length offering. It’s as rich and textured as rap albums come: more and more a rarity in today’s commercial hip-hop climate, this is the album people wanted Rapsody to make, and now the dog has caught the car on this one.\n\nPlease Don’t Cry follows five years after the 41-year-old MC’s treaty on gender studies waxed on Eve (2019), and it’s our deep and bold storyteller time tip of note in the bunch. Conceding the heavy and costly comparison to drop, similarly to Kendrick Lamar‘s To Pimp a Butterfly, singling out individual standout tracks on here is somewhat of a fool’s errand. Instead, this is a wholesale course meal meant to be savored in vulnerable confluence. On the one hand, there’s a meta fourth wall to the project that couches the blood, sweat, and tears of Marlanna Evans amidst a cathartic macro concert arrangement of hip-hop, R&B, neo-soul, and jazz. In the same breath, each tune is a microcosm of emotional states and styles in and of itself—bookended by the narration-centric thematic centerpiece of “She’s Expecting You” and the sugary keys of the epic spoken word plea of “Forget Me Not” (featuring a deliciously warped sample of BROCKHAMPTON‘s “SUMMER“). In between, there’s a formidable tale as old as time, one of self-discovery through exposure, through fearless expression for the first time. Please Don’t Cry finds Rapsody at her best, not holding back: it’s not for the faint of heart.\n\nSimilarly not suitable for the faint of heart is the reckoning of what is going down in the God-forsaken Caribbean country of Haiti right now. Just as the umpteenth forced foreign intervention is settling into the land in the hopes to stabilize it amidst a political vacuum and a guerrilla ruling through warlords, native transplant via New Jersey Mach-Hommy is riding on the coattails of his definitive homeland tetralogy installment, #RICHAXXHAITIAN. Out the same day as Please Don’t Cry, 17th May, one day before Haitian Flag Day—we weren’t kidding about May being stacked…—the album is Mach’s fourteenth to date. It’s a gesamtkunstwerk of insurrectionary socio-political vignettes, simultaneously doubling as the Haitian-American rapper’s most catchy and accessible. The oeuvre is a multi-lingual, multi-genre, and multi-cultural affair, cross-pollinating autochthonous Haitian traditions with gritty posse street rhymes, typically associated with the New York Tri-state area.\n\nThe Griselda Records-affiliate keeps it grimy throughout the seventeen tracks sequenced on the digital version of the album, clocking in at just shy of fifty minutes of runtime, but goes particularly hard on cuts such as “SONJE“, “COPY COLD” (amplified by a superlative tell-all verse by Black Thought), and “GUGGENHEIM JEUNE“. Elsewhere, he attains higher levels of earworminess—not exactly something we’d have thought we’d use to describe Mach-Hommy’s music—on “SUR LE PONT d’AVIGNON” and the titular lead single, aptly produced by fellow Haitian descendant KAYTRANADA (who is out with an impressive new tape of his own, just not strictly speaking a rap one to land on this list. Also no Knick wears #9 at the moment). Regardless, #RICHAXXHAITIAN is another full body of work experience for you, no cherry-picked finger food. It demands above-average listening prowess and command, but its rewards are so fulfilling that one might find themselves leaving the tape both spiritually and cerebrally re-aligned.\n\nWe sound like a broken record at this point, but the month of May shockingly managed to squeeze in one final musical coup de grâce before turning the calendar page. Long Beach rap laureate Vince Staples returned with his Def Jam swan song offering Dark Times on Friday the 24th, marking his sixth LP, a couple years after his double dipping with Vince Staples and Ramona Park Broke My Heart (2022). Perhaps the most singular and forlorn recommendation in this summer batch, the 35-minute statement comes as yet another reflective and contemplative series of essays. Less a cohesive concept album than a string of powerful short stories, the collection ventures in what’s arguably the vastest sonic range ever touched by the former Odd Future syndicate. While for all intents and purposes still filing this under a loud West Coast hip-hop file cabinet, it’s worth noting how numbers like “Shame on the Devil” flirts with jangly alt-pop instrumentals, while “Freeman” pushes experimental garage guitar licks way past the point one’d expect on a mainstream rap record.\n\nFair warning, if Slum Village’s F.U.N. is the most summer record on this list, Vince’s Dark Times is the least sunny one of the crop. I guess one could’ve figured that much from looking at their, album titles? Sometimes the proof really is in the pudding. However, fret not argonauts, since Vince’s got you and your feet covered with hot bops such as “Étouffée” and “Little Homies“—coincidentally the best, gnarliest, and most well rounded tunes on the whole record. In promoting the album, the 30-year-old LA-native asked fans not to overthink his songs, all to aware that is easier said than done when you happen to be one of the sharpest and critically acute pens of this generation’s rap cohort. Yet, that’s what makes this project a wicked collection of summer bars, too—aside from being Vince’s greatest, it’s also unassuming and easy listening to the ears, without sacrificing the usual poignancy and street wit folks have grown accustomed to expect from him.\n\nOur sixth suggestion dropped halfway through June, a month that usually does not mess around when it comes to raising the mercury bar. In keeping with the sweltering heat brought by the official calendar kick off of the summer season, NxWorries’s highly-anticipated sophomore project Why Lawd? keeps us sweating from all pores. The American hip-hop super duo comprised of singer, rapper, and record producer Anderson .Paak and producer/songwriter Knxwledge followed up their critically acclaimed cult debut Yes Lawd! eight years later with an ultra crafty helping of 19 new joints. Released under legendary underground hip-hop label Stones Throw Records, the project manages to top its lauded predecessor, doubling down on quality songwriting, impeccable deliveries, and a trademark vintage sound that somehow still reverberates as fresh and unique, in spite of how deeply influential it’s been throughout the past decade.\n\nSlowly rolled out throughout the past two years—lead single “Where I Go” featuring H.E.R. originally debuted as early as October 2022 (!)—and teased for even longer than that, the studio effort from the talented hip-hop duo was well worth the wait. Coasting through 45 minutes of runtime with the swagger and effortlessness of an off-season mixtape, this thing is extremely front-loaded, with one gorgeous slapper after another clocking in from second cut “86Sentra” through track number nine “FromHere“. A-list guests such as Charlie Wilson, Rae Khalil, and Earl Sweatshirt, as well as upheld catchiness make Why Lawd?‘s side B still well worth sticking around, in spite of a few dubs hinting at an even stronger record in there with a more focused editing. Nonetheless, cue this up if you’re in the market for some sexy, irreverent, and unhinged fun, all while summoning the Lord.\n\nLupe Fiasco‘s ninth studio LP Samurai is our penultimate tip off. Released just fresh outta the oven at the time of writing, this is a different kind of half hour to spend this summer. According to the groundbreaking Chicago MC, the project is “a loving & living portrait to and of one of my favorite artists, Amy Winehouse“. Because, sure, why not? The American rapper, record producer, and university professor’s successor to his otherworldly Drill Music in Zion (2022) has been highly anticipated—safe to say he did not phone it in. Once again entirely executive-produced by Drill Music chief sound orchestrator Soundtrakk, the concept for the record was grown from a voicemail left by the late English R&B singer for her producer Salaam Remi before her passing. In the note, the London-born singer/songwriter expressed her penchant for coming up with little, beautifully alliterated battle raps at the time, even likening herself to a Wu Tang Clan-inspired samurai.\n\nChannelling all of the above, Lupe allowed for the story and album to take on a life of their own, kicking dances off with the title track as lead single halfway through May, before teasing the full project one more time with the infectious victory lap of “Cake“. The project masterfully couches blistering highs and crushing lows all within eight records and half an hour of material, condensing subaltern scenarios and sketches of what a spitting Winehouse could have sounded like. Cuts such as “Palaces” at number four on the tracklist prove how easily the 42-year old alternative hip-hop pioneer can pen tunes so gorgeous they almost hurt, while “No. 1 Headband” acts as little reminder that he’s not forgotten how to have self-reflective fun, either. If you’re only sampling one project from this list of eight, and hinge on intellectually stimulating wordsmiths, make it this one.\n\nActually, maybe, make it Common and Pete Rock’s The Auditorium, Vol. 1. The only catch is that it’s not out yet, so don’t take our full word for it (methodical purity has left us long ago…). What is certain though, is that if we are to trust the first three teasers unearthed hitherto, “Wise Up“, “Dreamin’” and “All Kind of Ideas“, this is poised to be the signature hip-hop album of the summer, probably year. Marking the fifteenth solo studio LP for the Chicago conscious rap extraordinaire, The Auditorium, Vol. 1 is lucky enough to be enjoying Pete Rock’s unparalleled production chops throughout its projected fifteen cuts. A golden age East Coast hip-hop meeting of the minds, chopped and screwed in heaven. The full album is just mere days away, slated to drop everywhere on Friday 12th July. Here’s what we know for sure: it’s the summer, and there will be bars—guess the whole write up could’ve just been that verse.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nThere’s a target on Mach-Hommy’s back. Dead or alive. Reward unknown; although the protraction of techno-feudalism and post-colonial hegemony are probably solid enough guesses. You ask the Haitian-American rapper and record producer yourself. As revealed in his recent public service plea, following shortly after the release of his fourteenth solo album #RICHAXXHAITIAN, there appear to be obscure industry forces at play attempting to curtail the propagation of his message conveyance. Self-released on the 17th May, one day before the momentous annual celebration of Haitian Flag Day, the 17-track project completes the New Jerseyan’s autochthonous album tetralogy—also inclusive of H.B.O. (2016), and 2021’s Pray for Haiti and Balens Cho (Hot Candles)—and was preceded by the eponymous lead single in early May.\n\nToo bad that Google managed to botch the title track’s music video premiere on Mach-Hommy’s own YouTube channel, offering no conclusive explanation for it at all, leading to assume salacious intents behind the ‘unprecedented’ glitch. Too bad that mere days after the album’s public streaming release on DSPs, it mysteriously evaporated from leading outlet Spotify—the latter citing a takedown request from the artist’s camp itself, categorically denied by the Griselda syndicate in the aforementioned video explainer. In both cases, literally involving the largest streaming platform in the world (YouTube), and the on-demand audio service with the highest amount of global paying subscribers (Spotify), the explanations furnished left little to write home about.\n\nIn fact, Google’s troubleshooting yielded a complete and laughable non-starter. As outlined in the clip by Mach-Hommy, the internal investigation conducted by multiple layers of YouTube reps upon his flagging of the loss of admin privileges on his own account, as well as the temporary erasure of subscribers during the music video premiere window, returned a pathetic ‘we’ve got no clue as to what happened there, sorry’. Conversely, Spotify dug deeper into its more generous void of incongruous wiggle room in delivering their version of the root cause analysis, owing to the (wholly purposeful) digital record industry’s protocol entanglement. As mentioned, after both the Swedish streaming giant and an unnamed digital distributor washed their hands off by claiming the withdrawal request came from Mach-Hommy’s people, the East Coast MC was informed that his product, the #RICHAXXHAITIAN LP, was missing its Universal Product Code (UPC). An ontological fallacy, for not only was the release perfectly available on all other DSPs at the time, but as Mach rightfully cites in the video, the project wouldn’t have made it to Spotify servers in the first place without it.\n\nWhere affairs get even more nefarious is in the aggravating insult provided by the parties at play, who mentioned a now-deleted post by an faceless, nameless X user, interpreting #RICHAXXHAITIAN‘s disappearance from Spotify as a marketing stunt from Mach-Hommy, and fomenting doubts as to who watches the watchdogs in the online pursuits of the truth. The X user alleged that the MC’s strategy was to entice fans by sampling the album as a taster over release weekend, in the hope that they would turn to his webstore to purchase exclusive physical formats—going for a much higher price point. Once again, all of this getting debunked by the artist himself. Putting two and two together, one can’t help but think this is some sort of poetic injustice for a lyricist as concerned with historical revisionism, reparations, the Haitian diaspora, and the plague of colonialism in his ancestral country as he is. After all, retaliations might have assumed newer and more impenetrable forms in the modern age, but they are surely far from a holding pattern of inaction.\n\nThis all transpires as being particularly suspicious on account of not just the prolific rapper’s imperialistic establishment antagonism, but also his worthy industry literacy within contemporary digital music practices. Yes he is an actual multi-lingual prodigy thanks to his diverse cultural provenance, yet have you considered that the contemporary record industry’s intentionally dubious language is an idiom he can tally up as yet another atypical string in his bow? When he took legal DMCA action to have all of his works removed from online lyrics providers such as Genius in 2019, he knew he was stirring up a pretty big hornet’s nest. You will likely not be surprised to learn that Genius has long been finessing a number of licensing deals with DSPs under the hood; with one of the largest ones being with, guess whom? Spotify.\n\nThis is perhaps a good moment to afford us to elaborate on such content provisioning agreements. We wish we could go into more specifics, but please trust us when we say that we get Mach-Hommy. Without even delving into licensing deals involving the actual sound recordings couched within digital releases, aka the masters we all end up listening on the client side, the narrower lyrics and compositions provisioning business itself is riddled with enough jungly inaccessibility. Not unlike the wider record industry ecosystem, it’s a self-referential distribution funnel washed in a sea of conduits and intermediaries. Rightsholders—such as the self-released and self-published Mach-Hommy—are typically forced to strike deals with certain providers supplying other providers to at least a few degrees of separation before even making it to the end-consumer platforms such as Genius.\n\nNot only does each of these agents retain a significant double-digit kickback on any royalty exploitation event, but within the lyrics consumption realm specifically, these are the kind of publishing deals operating under so-called ‘most-favored-nation’ (MFN) terms. In other words, allowing no room for negotiation or clout at the dealings table whatsoever. What’s even more disheartening within such copyright systems and their application within modern digital platforms is that legal frameworks around royalty rates and statutory regulations are a total mess. Most royalty payments are still remitted via lump sum settlements and upfront reconciliations, with little to no consideration for the actual mechanical reproduction figures for each work. In a way not too dissimilar from Mach’s warlord-stricken gang-centric Caribbean homeland, each end-user platform is free to enact their own price-regulated cartel, benefitting from the lack of international regulation and governance around fair trade.\n\nYet Mach-Hommy resists. He educates himself, learns the language of the oppressor, and fights with whatever he can. That’s why he’s wanted. That’s why he has a target on his back. And a very concrete countermeasure he enacts is seizing back control of his own art. What he does is that he increases the average consumption price point for each of his superfans, by selling physical formats for three-to-four digit $ price tags. For those versions, he retools the tracklist, too. In #RICHAXXHAITIAN‘s case, track number two “ANTONOMASIA” is titled “SOBRIQUET”, enlisting a guest verse from Tha God Fahim instead of Roc Marciano (allegedly a vox populi decision, as the rapper held a poll during a listening party earlier in the year). “BON BAGAY” at number four is a vinyl-exclusive, while the streaming-available “SONJE” is pushed back on the sequencing to act as the album’s coda. Crucially, “SUR LE PONT D’AVIGNON”, indeed available on streaming services, is wiped off the vinyl version as a quintessential middle finger to French post-colonial forces. Elsewhere on the waxing, “XEROX CLAT” gets retitled to “XEROX TWATS”, while “COPY COLD” and “PADON”—renamed “PARDON” with a Mach-Hommy verse in Tha God Fahim’s stead—are backtracked by a different instrumental beat than their digital counterparts.\n\nIn a press statement accompanying #RICHAXXHAITIAN, the wordsmith made the following clear:\n\nI’ve always wanted to rep for Haiti and the cultural and intellectual richness we’ve provided the world. From our musical styles like kontradans that have influenced world music, our natural resources which provide so much raw material for so many important advancements in technology, our thinkers that pioneered philosophical movements and Black pride, and our spiritual leaders who kept the religious traditions of Guinea alive and intact, the religious traditions of Ayiti…\n\nMusically, the album is a masterpiece. It’s a dense, wordy, intricate, disparate, and sticky affair—all at the same time. There’s a glacial undertone throughout the production that exhumes a dejected haziness fitting like a glove atop of Mach-Hommy’s boneless and contorted flows. Complication here is being offered as an act of resistance. Those who really listen, get it. In reviewing the record, good ole Professor Skye made the case for obscurity and incomprehension as a purposeful creative strategy for Mach-Hommy to fence off shoehorning and diluting industrial gentrification. While at the same doing justice to the richly profound social and cultural heritage of Haiti. It’s a valid heuristic, one that enables the New Jersey-native to always be one step ahead of reductive law enforcement. In his line of work, that happens to be private hedge fund-backed technology companies, purporting themselves as the arbiters of an emancipated creative ecosystem, fostering democratized access to all art. Sur le pont, d’Avignon…\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time. And don’t forget to pray for Haiti.\n\nAV\n\nMetro Boomin might just have churned out the best long-form hip-hop listening experience of 2023. No hyperbole. Thirteen individual cuts, spread across 47 minutes of impactful, unbridled, and envelope-pushing music—all without hinging on tired or predictable recruits such as Drake, The Kid LAROY, or Post Malone. Now a little over two months old, his Across the Spider-Verse (Soundtrack from and Inspired by the Motion Picture) radiates as such a convincing body of work that no other major drop has seemingly been able to top it hitherto (even though Travis Scott’s UTOPIA, albeit irreconcilably different, gets scarily close). Dare we say it, with this compilation, the American record producer, executive, and DJ has sequenced the most accomplished popular soundtrack since arguably Black Panther (2018). But then, he’s so plugged into the cultural zeitgeist that one would be hard-pressed to think of someone better suited to score the marvelous adventures of Miles Morales, constituent of all the righteous values and virtues they emanate.\n\nSonically, the tight collection of tracks offers both an aptly gelled and unified listening experience, as well as radio-friendly heavy rotation potential from nearly all numbers tracklisted. Believe it or not, this thing weaves one sticky, swaggerish, and memorable exploit after another; all without sacrificing artistic bravery and stylistic exploration (one shouldn’t forget this thing is supposed to be attached to a ginormous Hollywood blockbuster). Modern trap, conscious hip-hop, alt-R&B, neo-soul, and flat out bubblegum pop; they are all welcome and at home here. Even when at times the score dances with devilish accusations of getting phoned in formulaic and a tad one-dimensional—such as on “Danger” or “Silk and Cologne“—enough perspective and a particular appreciation for the motion picture are quick to dissipate such affronts. That is, for instance those two songs might work less efficiently as standalone singles, yet in the context of the whole album they sound just as indispensable and necessary as the other eleven.\n\nNot to mention the deeper cuts on here. Through his flavorsome and balanced taste making on moments such as the exquisite slice of high brow alt pop on the James Blake-assisted “Hummingbird“, the forlorn standout “Calling“, or even the tenderly sweet Coi Leray vocal flex “Self Love“, the 29-year old Missourian sculpted an acoustic stream of consciousness more akin to, say, Frank Ocean‘s Blonde, than the first Various Artists-downgraded Into the Spider-Verse OST. And to think that for reasons allegedly unknown (yet just as easily guessed), the Boominati Worldwide founder had to do without the inclusion of poppy wind in sail of Dominic Fike‘s “Mona Lisa“—released this past 2nd June as lead single for the whole multimedia Across the Spider-Verse venture. Granted, the track was reportedly always set to only be thrown onto the compilation’s deluxe edition. Yet with the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight, Metro’s herculean creative effort transpired as more focused and zero’ed in without it.\n\nSpeaking of deluxe editions, the record’s Disc 2 counts five additional tracks. They are all well and fun, but frankly, do nothing but further prove and solidify Young Metro’s editing capaciousness as an on-demand executive producer. Mind you, none of the bonus joints are bad in and of themselves—they’re all perfectly decent and enjoyable while they’re on. However, the thirteen minutes of extra material are of a cutting room floor affectation for a reason, and did not make the main tracklist’s cut for evident causes. That is not to say that they don’t possess virtues: “Ansiedades” beautifully elevates the dreamy pipes of Puerto Rican singer Mora, potentially introducing him to a limitless audience. With that being said, aside from showcasing the St Louis native’s knack for musical experimentation, the bottom line is that their clubby, vibe-based, electronic prevalence would’ve caused them to stick out like sore thumbs—cases in point, “Take It To The Top” and “Infamous“. That’s a shame and pity a savvy and tasteful curator such as Metro could not have allowed.\n\nLest we all forget, the Republic Records-earmarked Across the Spider-Verse (Soundtrack from and Inspired by the Motion Picture) stands as mainstream companion piece to the more canonical incidental tunes released under Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Original Score), orchestrated and arranged by English composer Daniel Pemberton. For once, the Universal Music Group’s USA imprint should get its due flowers for the formidable environmental enablement they were able to grant Metro and his ambitious multi-licensing roster vision. As many as sixteen official featured performing acts in total are present on display credit-level here. They range from budding new guard picks like Roisee, EI8HT, and Coi Larey, and journey all the way to bona fide elder rap statesmen such as A$AP Rocky, Future, and Lil Wayne. Oh, and did we mention managing to enlist critical swan song co-sign from none other than genre GOAT Nas?\n\nNot unlike some of the key constituencies of African philosophy Ubuntu, with integrity, responsibility, empathy, and focus, Coach Metro has mastered a call up of a winning sample of carefully functional picks. His team tactics surgically constructed a court tapestry mastering both defense and offense, both below-the-rim paint points and long-range triples. If the earned trust from such a stacked A-list line up—as well as that he placed on them—does not go to prove that the producer born Leland Tyler Wayne doesn’t have the clout and creative vision to claim a marquee seat at the hip-hop conversation table, then virtually nothing else will. As the genre celebrates half a century of cultural impact, appropriations, and misunderstandings on this very day, its spiritual founders and forefathers can take a wealth of comfort from the notion that its future-proofing keys are in safe and capable hands. Now go watch the film. Then re-watch it. More importantly, listen to Young Metro’s synchronized masterpiece, we might need to await another five years for such a good movie soundtrack.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time. And happy birthday to hip-hop this time around.\n\nAV\n\nDominic Fike is fine. He is fine with being back in his hometown of Naples, FL, after Hollywood didn’t need a reason to make him think he looked bigger than he was. He is fine with not pretending his newest album Sunburn isn’t anything other than a scattered collection of old loose tracks. He is fine with having made it out of the dirt, the hardship, and the struggle—rags to riches, felony conviction included. He is fine with survival’s guilt. Where Kendrick Lamar famously pained himself to explain “How Much a Dollar Cost“, Fike’s rebuttal stops at the otherworldly hive mind of “How Much Is Weed?“. He is fine with being a prodigal lonewolf amidst a tragically golden generation—he’s fine even with BROCKHAMPTON being no more.\n\nProudly and defiantly an anti-concept album, Sunburn is the 27-year old American singer-songwriter and actor’s second major label project, after instigating a cut through bidding war amongst several record companies from behind the cold confines of his penitentiary cell during the latter end of the last decade—with Columbia Records emerging victorious in 2018. So unlike his 2020 genre-mashing debut What Could Possibly Go Wrong, his latest is a warm, fun, and summer-winking compilation of disparate material, stemming from pretty much the same writing sessions as its predecessor. The lightness and effortlessness with which Fike almost dismisses his current excitement amidst Sunburn‘s promotional run, is refreshing at the very least.\n\nCounterintuitively, that is part of what makes this beach mixtape so good. While some might still file it as a byproduct of cool cold-bloodedness, the former SoundCloud rap sensation’s indifference toward stoking fabricated enthusiasm by over-marketing the 15-cut LP actually makes way for the music to speak for itself. It’s not like one could forcibly blame Dominic, either. Almost every record on the Jim-E Stack-assisted sophomore outing dates back to about three years ago. At least a few of them have been floating around the deep Fike lore and ether since 2021, in either live or teaser form. And to think that the eclectic and sticky third lead single “Mona Lisa” wasn’t even written with the album in mind (initially previewing as OST crown jewel as part of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse).\n\nThere’s an evident sense of appeasement and resolve in watching the former jailbird and victim of class feudalism speak and carry himself today—frankly, that’s something all of us can count as a dub. Fike exhumes a kind of seasonality and weariness that betrays both his young age and spotless babyface, one that only someone whose adolescence was stripped away by crime, addiction, and poverty-stricken milieus could possibly sport. Much like so many other burdened by similar disenfranchisement, Dominic turned to music for salvation. Owing to such a coping mechanism, he’s now proudly and nonchalantly wearing some of those late Nineties/early Noughties creative influences on his tattooed sleeves.\n\nThusly, it shouldn’t come as a blistering surprise that tasteful and breezy “Think Fast” at number three on the record sees a loud and loaded co-sign from none other than Weezer‘s Rivers Cuomo—with a true blue interpolation of the Los Angeles pop punk giants’ “Undone — The Sweater Song“, no less. Or that the elusive and catchiest number on Sunburn, “Frisky“, somehow succeeds at pouring out evident echoes of early 00s Black Eyed Peas mixed with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Meanwhile, the overrated and overproduced sensual pop of Justin Timberlake is an undeniable inspiration on “Bodies” halfway through the mixtape. Yet again, fourth lead single teasing the full release “Mama’s Boy” betrays ephemeral Strokes fingerprints all over its instrumental canvas. Get the point?\n\nDominic Fike is fine with staying true to himself, and not cracking under the ostracizing major label pressure of unnecessarily sugarcoating something that for him, truly, is passé. He is fine with some of his stans’ para-social behavior, stretching as far as digging up a whole other album‘s worth of unreleased material online. He is fine with understanding the subtle and nuanced specifics of latter day capitalism’s diminishing returns, letting the spate of irresistible hooks on the title track and “Dark” speak on his behalf instead. He is fine with reverting home and providing for his mother and siblings, now that he’s a multi-millionaire with a lot more music in the can. Music he’s actually psyched to talk about.\n\nPerhaps Fike’s most telling and poetic middle finger to retrograde major circuit antics has got to be the way he (mis)handled the inclusion of groovy funk-rap standout “Mona Lisa” into Sunburn. Originally released as a standalone single attached to the theatric release of the eponymous blockbuster movie in early June, the cut was also naturally made available as part of the deluxe version of Metro Boomin’s watertight Presents Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse soundtrack album. At least this was the case for about a month. That is, on release day (7th July), the number inexplicably disappeared from Metro Boomin’s OST tracklist (although astute bloodhounds might still dig up idle versions with it on Spotify), only to mysteriously pop up on the 15-track version of Fike’s latest LP again—notably missing from his original 14-track issue.\n\nWhile adding, removing, and switching individual tracks around on varying iterations of album sequences is nothing new per se in the modern streaming age, alas, one can’t but smile in schadenfreude at the thought of spree of Columbia record executives’ headaches and the wealth of eyebrows raised as Fike urged them to reinstate the track on his own solo project—probably invoking some right of first refusal last minute. One that scrambled lawyers had to hastily retrofit amidst consulting and negotiating with a plethora of sub labels, all contracted by Spider-Man soundtrack’s curator Republic Records. And we all know Sony Music Entertainment (Columbia) and Universal Music Group (Republic) aren’t exactly best friends. Yeah well, Dominic Fike is fine with all of that.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nTrailblazing a distinct chronological spate of significant releases coming out throughout June and July—including Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Far From Saints, Killer Mike, Queens of the Stone Age, Dominic Fike, and George Clanton—the mighty Foo Fighters are back. This time scathed. Dropping this past Friday 2nd June, But Here We Are counts as the alternative rock mainstays’s eleventh studio LP—their first since the untimely death of their longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins, early last year. The project comes orchestrated and arranged by returning production consigliere Greg Kurstin, whose royal pop knack and undeniable chemistry with the band made him an obvious choice for such a critical artistic statement in the group’s timeline, even after the mixed bag success collected in the wake of his work on both 2017’s Concrete and Gold as well as 2021’s Medicine at Midnight.\n\nUnsurprisingly, and perhaps fittingly, frontman Dave Grohl traveled back to handling percussive duties on the whole record, marking his first official drum credit on a Foos album in almost twenty years. Not only that, the stickman-turned-ringleader also saw fit to lace a familial spin into the recording process for the first time, inviting his 17-year-old daughter Violet to sing prominent background vocals on the hazy, hollow, and dreamy “Show Me How“—the formidable third single in the lead up to the full album. Unveiled a mere seven days before the entire collection of songs, the track eerily journeys through plateaus of both reverb canvasses and gnarly distorted licks alike, before unboxing an unexpected sense of finality woven into the narrator’s bounce-back arc: “I’ll take care of everything / I’ll take care of everything from now on“.\n\nIn the album’s relatively packed and crammed promo roll out, said slow tempo number was preceded initially by the stark and stoic lead single “Rescued” (released on 19th April), as well as the gold-striking throwback grunge belter “Under You” around a month later. Both cuts carry a musical ethos that translates as an earnest return to form for the Seattle-gestated band. Raw and unfiltered aches of grief bleed through the somewhat low-fidelity taped instrumentation on the former, only to be snapped out of their emotional stalemate by two robust sets of verses with lots and lots of teeth (“It came in a flash, it came outta nowhere / It happened so fast, and then it was over; I fell in a trap, my hеart’s getting colder / It’s coming on fast, it’s over my shouldеr“). Conversely, But Here We Are‘s sophomore single triumphs in its catchy, anthemic, and heavily Hüsker Dü-indebted refrain, all the while lodging slews of nostalgic sonic moods that were first successfully forayed into as part of Dave’s inspired first three album run (1995-1999).\n\nHardly earning enough grandfathered rights to be considered an official single, the RCA Records-affiliates released a final teaser a few days before the arrival of the full length in the form of the 10-minute epic fever dream “The Teacher“. Sequenced as the album’s penultimate cut, before the unplugged, jagged, and forlorn coda “Rest“, the song unfolds and crumbles before the listener’s ears by way of proxying obsessive and thick stanzas atop of an unhinged baseline jam impetus, the latter ultimately binding the whole herculean effort together. It’s indulgent, inconclusive, and far from the most memorable moment on this thing—once again, definitely not single material. Yet this exploit’s biggest merit, standing as the Foo Fighters’ longest recorded track to date, is to allegorize the loose and unconstrained ethos that served as the album’s through line on here, whilst its constituent human parts rebuilt themselves amidst junctures of grief and mourning.\n\nAside from the aforementioned first two promo cuts, the record’s side A sports quite a lot more to write home about. At number three on the tracklist is “Hearing Voices“, a groovier and more contemplative affair wholly anchored by Grohl’s helpless cries, lamenting whatever part of letting go of someone who’s no longer there somehow still involves unfulfilled promises—in all likelihood reaching for a hybridized and spiritualized pastiche version of both Hawkins and his late mother Virginia (who passed away mere months after the drummer last year): “I’ve seen you in the moon / I wish that you were here / You promised me your words / A whisper in my ear / Every night I tell myself nothing like you could last forever“. The album title track follows suit, with its impervious and claustrophobic gain six-string riffs, pummeling a sense of utter paranoia and unsettlement into the track’s otherwise conventional late Foo Fighters formula. Dave Grohl’s soaring vocals reach husky heights rarely heard on a deep cut before, especially with such a quasi-psychedelic drawl, spookily adding to the tune’s disorienting sentence.\n\nWrapping up side A is perhaps the poppiest and most sanitized cut on the whole thing: “The Glass“. Flexing evident Concrete and Gold muscles on the peppy beat and flow front (cue “The Sky Is A Neighborhood“), the song does stick out a little bit like a sterilized thumb amidst the sea of musical roughness and lyrical rawness found elsewhere on the project. Don’t get it twisted, it’s far from the worst thing the Foos have ever put out, but the sensation it would’ve felt much more at home on any of their previous two LPs is one to not be easily shaken off—even after repeated listens. But Here We Are‘s flip side picks up strong again with “Nothing at All“, a Frankenstein’d power pop voyage starting off all but approachable and sticky, before completely transforming into an abrasive and savage chorus wave wholly obliterating the previously collected brownie points with casual listeners.\n\nThe aforementioned gorgeous ballad “Show Me How” follows on the tracklist at number seven, before deep feels continue to run at full steam thanks to the subsequent “Beyond Me“; an austere and truthful slice of emotional rock and roll, doubling as perhaps the most beautiful track on the record. “If it all just went away / Would you be kind? / Would you be so kind?; Are you well? / I can’t tell / Do tell / Do tell“, asks the former Nirvana percussionist, in a custom and manner that is so believable it hurts. “The Teacher” and “Rest” end the 48-minute runtime listening experience on a somewhat weaker note, although not less honest or compelling. More in particular, the latter cut’s second half suddenly photosynthesizes into a haunting and unsettling wall of distorted sound around the 2:40 mark, moonlighting as the farewell sendoff to this album’s dedicated dearly departed, and anyone else in the listeners’ minds for that matter: “Rest, you can rest now / Rest, you will be safe now“.\n\nSafe to say with But Here We Are the Foo Fighters have made their best set of cohesive songs since Wasting Light. More than a decade and a pandemic later, and one core member down, they attested once again that resilience and defiance are two key ingredients in their raison d’être, whether they like it or not. If nothing else, they both have proven to be powering some of their best and most existential songwriting. With a set of ten new songs under their belts, and after having put to rest most rumors around seeking closure in order to move past their recent hardships by announcing celebrity session drummer Josh Freese (of Devo, Guns N’ Roses, and Nine Inch Nails fame) as Hawkins replacement, Dave, Nate, Pat, Chris, and Rami finally seem ready to move on and go back to being the biggest arena rock band on the planet. To do the easy part, in other words.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nFOO FIGHTERS\n\nBUT HERE WE ARE\n\n2023, Roswell Records\n\nhttps://foofighters.com\n\nStandalone singles killed the album star. If it weren’t for a grieving Foo Fighters—now sans late drummer Taylor Hawkins—fitting to the standard industry mould with their lead single-and-LP announcement combo (“Rescued“, teasing the release of their eleventh studio album But Here We Are next month), one would be fooled to think better of the notion that focus tracks need to exist as part of a far-sighted project roll out. Thus, by way of rounding up a batch of recently unveiled solo records, here we dare put forward a non-definitive reflection around the seemingly dissipated importance to lend a monetizable roadmap to new music.\n\nBeginning chronologically and alphabetically with vaporwave heavyweight George Clanton. Nearly cracking under the pressure to follow up his spotless and watertight Slide record from 2018, the 100% Electronica label founder unveiled his latest smash hit single “I Been Young” early last month—only to not be accompanied by an official announcement about a potential full length container. Sure, while it is true that the 35-year old electronic musician has been all but half-jokingly teasing his newest project on social media since his incandescent Nick Hexum collaboration, given his humorous and self-deprecating ethos it’s hard to gauge how founded that pipeline might actually be.\n\nLest we get it twisted here: prioritizing autonomous singles is nothing inherently new and unchartered. Over the past decade, the complete digitization and platformization of music consumption has made it so that its industry specifics design a clear incentivization scheme benefitting the ‘waterfall’ release of smaller projects (read: singles) over full bodies of work. Partly due to the major music services’s editorial playlisting leitmotivs, partly pushed by the opportunity of creating more ‘release events’ by staggering smaller drops over time, artists and labels alike have not been shy to tap into the predicament headfirst. Whether pundits mess with it or not—such tidal wave is not to be stopped and rather ubiquitous today.\n\nInterestingly enough, instead of selling out to such rabid cheat code demands of the modern streaming economy, Clanton saw fit to take a somewhat different homegrown path, by creating a subscription-like community around 100% Electronica. He then elevated the concept to a whole new level with 100% ElectroniCON in 2019, effectively the first vaporwave music festival in the world. As the planet deranged and all live entertainment ground to a halt, he kept it going through so-called Virtual Utopia gigs, as well as by establishing a weekly VR talk show, THE BIG STREAM. Clearly, an adapted approach to a changing paradigm in the machinery—yet, still no unequivocal announcement to anticipate a next record. Here’s to hoping a Slide follow up does in fact materialize, for “I Been Young” sounds just as dreamy, hazy, and sticky as anything on it. Alas, it is also not exactly the type of material that would sit naturally next to “Fucking Up My Life” (his other standalone drop) on an LP’s tracklist.\n\nThis specific sample of latest releases seems to be doubling as something akin to a final straw. Especially on account of the fact that these artists have historically made it a point to curate and elevate full album experiences in their discographies. Let’s take 28-year old Brooklyn, NY MC Joey Bada$$ as further exhibit. His newest R&B-infused joint “Fallin’” quickly followed on the coattails of last year’s brilliant 2000, the highly anticipated spiritual successor to his groundbreaking debut mixtape 1999 (2012). With a street date of 7th April, and featuring production from Powers Pleasant, DJ Khalil, Chuck Strangers, Adam Pallin, and McClenney, the 4:30 minutes-crooner finds the Pro Era founder coasting through a butter-smooth neo-soul canvas for the song’s greasy first-half, before switching gears into sets of convinced and stern 16s that all bring out his spitting prowess on the backend—just in case anyone needed reminding.\n\nThe record is a welcome change of pace for the up and coming thespian, who flexes both singing and compositional proficiency on a cut that would have admittedly felt a tad out of place on his jazz rap-indebted third studio LP last year. Most suspiciously though, it’s the lack of cliffhanging substance attached to the headline drop, leaving fans with little to nothing to look for forward to musically past this point. For at this time it is wholly unclear whether “Fallin'” is to lead up to a new sizable project from the progressive rapper, or if it’s to exist as an isolated statement à la his impeccable and faithful Mos Def cover “UMI Says“, performed live for Australia triple j‘s storied Like A Version series at the turn of the new year.\n\nMeanwhile, just mere days ago on 27th April, it was high time for the welcome and highly anticipated return of New Jersey alt rockers The Gaslight Anthem. Their newest track “Positive Charge” represents the first taste of original music after their seven-year indefinite hiatus—and since their lukewarm 2014 fifth studio LP Get Hurt—thanks to frontman Brian Fallon getting them back together to much fan acclaim last year after a successful solo stint. Ever the quintessential album-oriented group, their fans had however hoped their comeback single would be splashed together with a more robust dispatch, hopefully revealing details around their long-awaiting next studio project; tough luck for them too.\n\nMusically, the song plugs straight into Brian Fallon, Alex Rosamilia, Alex Levine, and Benny Horowitz’s trademark punk-indebted heartland aesthetic. Dirty, distorted, ragged, yet undercut by a melodic emotionality that affords them certain of liberties to structure their tune around pop tropes. Thing is: no album release date as of yet. Granted, The Gaslight Anthem are the type of salt of the earth band from whom it would be outright unthinkable to not imagine a full album transpiring from a singles release cycle, especially when it’s a long-anticipated reunion one. What’s particularly uneasy here though is the complete lack of LP forethought in burning such comeback card, unlike say the aforementioned Foo Fighters—a band most people would likely claim The Gaslight Anthem are cut from a similar clot of.\n\nMuch like “Positive Charge”, the final record scrutinized today comes courtesy of distribution from Sony Music-owned Thirty Tigers, and marks the surprise-release of a new loose joint called “SentRock” by legendary Chicago lyricist Lupe Fiasco. Named after fellow Chi-towner and visual artist SentRock—real name Joe Perez—the tune is being dished out as part of a cross-media collaboration that resulted in limited-edition autographed prints of his A Westside Bird’s Eye View painting, doubling as its front cover. The abstract and jolty single is the MIT visiting professor‘s first taste of new music since his watertight Drill Music in Zion project last year, and yes, you guessed it right: no indication has hitherto been given as to whether it is to function as teaser to something bigger in the pipe. In Lupe’s defense, he appears to be keeping fairly busy on the heels of his recent nomination as Saybrook Fellow at Yale University—highlighting the conscious rapper’s latest honor in a series in the realm of academia.\n\nAs media outlets and online fan communities alike all heavily debate around the likelihood of full length collections of songs by these four acts in varying degrees of speculation, there’s no denying the notion that most artists and labels largely do so to protect themselves and the sacredness of their writing process. Chances are, all aforementioned creatives currently fall into that category. With that being said, there exists a foreboding sense of aftermath from a chasm that was perhaps long bound to happen, and that now seems to be reaching what were once immaculate corners of a revered space, that used to actually care about the craft of an album, and that wouldn’t stick their necks out unless there was one to announce. For as much as we find it convenient to throw around the self-protection argument when faced with their absence, what if the artists themselves have stopped giving a damn?\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nGEORGE CLANTON\n\nI BEEN YOUNG\n\n2023, 100% Electronica\n\nhttps://www.100percentelectronica.com/\n\nJOEY BADA$$\n\nFALLIN’\n\n2023, Columbia Records\n\nhttps://www.joeybadass.com/\n\nTHE GASLIGHT ANTHEM\n\nPOSITIVE CHARGE\n\n2023, Thirty Tigers\n\nhttps://www.thegaslightanthem.com/\n\nLUPE FIASCO\n\nSENTROCK\n\n2023, Thirty Tigers\n\nhttps://www.lupefiasco.com/\n\nAs if ruled by near Swiss clockwork precision, 48-year old singer/songwriter Ryan Adams once again made good on his unwritten pledge to dish out yet another collection of new music on average about every third month. This time earmarked by his ninth project containing previously unreleased material since December 2020 — tenth, if considering his mid-March Return to Carnegie Hall EP — the alt-folk heavyweight re-ascends into the global ether by way of a full rework of brit-pop giants Oasis‘s (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? Offered once more as a download giveaway to newsletter subscribers via his PaxAm label hub, and already slated for a subsequent full blown release on licensed services, the reimagined batch appears as a double-sided 14-cut reinterpretation of the original 1995 rock classic.\n\nThus wrapping up a wholly uncalled for, yet overall more than gratifying, trilogy of covers, Adams’s Morning Glory follows in the wake of his own personal takes on two other cornerstones of modern folk rock: Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks and Springsteen‘s Nebraska — originally unveiled on last Christmas day, and at the beginning of December, respectively. This latest exploit is handily the most daring and wildest set of liberties the North Carolinian seized as part of the unofficial cover series yet. From the re-sequenced tracklist, the upgrade of as many as four lead single B-sides (“Talk Tonight“, “Headshrinker“, “Acquiesce“, and “Rocking Chair“), to the almost complete de-electrification of the instrumental canvas, Morning Glory sees a worshipping scholar affording himself just enough envelope-pushing inertia to both celebrate and advance the work of art at once.\n\nIn-between such heaps of legendary recordings rearrangements, the PaxAm founder also found time to announce to the world that he had gotten his old revered Cardinals band back together earlier in March — aligning the newsflash with the release of their stern piano-led comeback single “Dreams of the Working Class“. In the same breath, he also squeezed in the dispatch of a forthcoming gargantuan US Coast-to-Coast tour accompanied by the band. Their time on the road starts next month and will keep a newly redrafted lineup, inclusive of Brad Pemberton on percussions, Chris Stills on guitars, Daniel Clarke on keys, and A-list record executive moonlighting as bassist Don Was, occupied traveling across America through mid October.\n\nMeanwhile, as he’s wrapping up the final European leg of his year-long solo acoustic run, the former Whiskeytown ringleader made sure to cue up the drop of Morning Glory with his physical arrival in ole Blighty, just before Easter. In great British catholic spirit, he also saw fit to stitch a revised and regionally fitting front cover on the record, tributing folklore Mancunian TV soap opera Coronation Street (see below), aside from of course indulging in the deconsecrated exercise of resuscitating the seminal collection of songs on the margins of Christianity’s parallel antic a few days later.\n\nTo humour the analysis a smidge deeper, it’s interesting and perhaps not coincidental to constatate how Adams plucked one cornerstone album for each different decade leading up to the new millennium. Albeit not churned out strictly chronologically, Blood on the Tracks (1975), Nebraska (1982), and now Morning Glory (1995) can all serve as auxiliary stepping stones on a roadmap that charts the impact and influence of watershed rock albums on both the wider cultural zeitgeist, and on Adams himself. Bearing witness to his increasingly exuberant rendering of these musical staples as part of the incubatory artistic heritage that moulded him is to watch a musician having more and more fun doing it (something discussed as early as in the first cover series instalment). It’s a touch tired and microwaved posit, but the key here is in the process, rather than the output.\n\nProgressing from the unassuming and somewhat dejected pound-for-pound rendition of The Boss‘s ten tracker — with only minor compositional personalisations and musical derivatives — to then alight at the braver and aesthetically bolder instrumental coda choices laced into Dylan’s fifteenth studio LP, the Jacksonville, NC-native seems to have come full circle with the Gallagher bros’ magnum opus. By his own admission, this latest two-sided reverb and delay-effected affair stands to pull the curtains on his interpreter phase — at least for a while — an assertion that lends a heightened sense of closure over what some Oasis purists might brush off as iconoclast creative choices on Morning Glory.\n\nWith the sole exception of the record’s opener (“Hello“) and closer (“Champagne Supernova“), every single other number on Adams’s Morning Glory is completely refactored and repositioned compared to its reference LP, fundamentally forging a whole different album listening experience—not to mention the seemingly untouchable tracklist contamination through the inclusion of almost 30% of cutting room floor material. So the project is now fourteen cuts long, spanning an hour and five minutes of runtime, as opposed to the brit-pop chart-toppers’ 50 minutes and de facto only ten songs (sans the two “Swamp Song” skits). Parochial absolutists of the Manchester prodigal sons couldn’t necessarily be faulted for being up in arms at the mere thought of it.\n\nThis not only warrants the inquiry of whether Adams’s Morning Glory can even be considered a covers album of (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? in the first place, but it also refracts a whole new beam of light on what is, perhaps notoriously, the Cardinals frontman’s biggest and most successful track to date: his 2004 Love Is Hell cover of Oasis’s “Wonderwall“. Then smartly and tastefully stripped back to a thin acoustic backbone and drenched in reverb compared to the reference track, his 2023 version is, well, even more stripped back to a thin acoustic backbone, and even more drenched in reverb.\n\nRight from the inaugural announcement that he was working toward his own take on the Manchester heroes’ second studio album last year, the question arousing the single largest amount of curiosity amongst his listenership was, understandably, how he would’ve re-dressed one of the most popular songs of all time. Once again. By sticking to the tried and trued guns of his first groundbreaking recitation, one can’t but feel like he not only missed a brilliant opportunity to breathe new life into what’s almost become a laughing stock within his formidable catalogue, but it also raises a whole slew of questions over how enslaved by that 2004 version he’s become. Almost to the point of feeling pressured to build a whole cover album around it.\n\nIn his concluding defence, Adams did introduce his Morning Glory as “[w]eirdly like LOVE IS HELL had a brother from another mother maybe”. Definitely Maybe: with twenty-twenty hindsight, chances are that covering the Oasis debut could have made for a fairer choice to both him and the music.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nAlmost fifteen years after their off-kilter, watershed, and unceremonious split in a Parisian backstage, it’s hard to overstate the amount of influence, longing, and nostalgia English rock band Oasis has propagated in its aftermath. Although most of the attention and money on the heels of their disbandment revolved around shoehorning an improbable reunion by way of reconciling the Gallagher Bros’s insurmountable differences, the britpop marquee fixture’s creative footprint has found boundless ways to permeate inspiratory wells of lots of contemporary acts in its wake—both within and outside the immediate confines of rock and roll.\n\nIt could be contended that two latter-day quintessential offshoots of such a musical lineage would be fellow Mancunian indie rockers Shader on the one hand, and Tacoma, Washington-based Enumclaw on the other. Aside from how their music rings and shreds (more on this below), both foursomes sport self-evident signs of worshipping association with their spiritual grandfathers—the shared stomping ground coupled with a parka-punk antic in the former group’s case, the “best band since Oasis” biography tagline for the latter. Yet the apparent similarities between these outfits should theoretically end there.\n\nThat is, geographically and socio-economically, the band members’ upbringings and backgrounds could not be more different from each other, at least at first glance. For starters, a planet-sectioning 4,650 miles/7,500 km separate the primordial soups from within which Shader and Enumclaw sprouted. If the artistic extrapolation borrowed from Oasis’s industry-changing sound and aesthetic is more than comprehensible in the Manchester natives’ case, it does require a more substantial cognitive leap for the American Fat Possum Records signees. Not unrelatedly, as the advent of geographically distributed and interconnected nodes of connection went on to annul even the stealthiest of outstanding barriers, a cultural dynamic directly stemming from Benedict Anderson’s imagined communities ensued.\n\nWith both acts properly soaked and hard-boiled in guitar-led no frills indie rock—one wouldn’t be too far off in picturing them with a sprinkle of mid-Naughties emo sensibilities on top—their musical crossover pushes past the high regard they each hold the britpop icons in. Refreshingly in the present climate, virtually every creative component baked into each of their collections of songs to date is built in order to thrust the guitar as the lead protagonist instrument, rather than blink-and-you-miss it-bit part in much of today’s tired rock canon. Sticky intro riffs, slews of parallel melodic riffs, main vocal dynamics atop of consonant arpeggios: these all revolve around six-strings, not unlike a certain giant band from the 90s.\n\nHowever, perhaps Shader and Enumclaw’s most appeasing and earnest value is found in their unabashed and dejected adoption of true blue, tried and true pop rock songwriting formulas. Without ever incurring the risk of coming across as one-dimensional, their verse/chorus/verse/bridge/chorus song-crafting method is of an endearing textbook execution. This results in multiple cuts on either of their debut studio LPs Save the Baby and Everything Is Connected sounding handily and seamlessly like they could sneak into each other’s tracklist without anyone batting an eye (take Shader’s “There Was a Time“, “Time Is Right” as well as “Runaway“—or conversely, their US counterparts’ uncanny sonic adjacency of “Cowboy Bebop” and “Jimmy Neutron“).\n\nLest we lose our trail of thought here—both quartets wear their singular strain of britpop influence proudly on their sleeves. Hence, the notion that significant portions of their studio-grading recordings come across like they could be covering each other isn’t exactly an affront to the Pepsi test. Yet the set of coincidences start to run deep as soon as one realizes that their aforementioned long-gestated debut projects came out within the span of two weeks of each other, across mid to late October last year. Even more surreally, both bands enlist a member whose surname spells Edwards, and watch this: they both play bass.\n\nWe’ll spare you some of the most surface-level traits that could be thrown into the set of explanatory variables in a hypothetical regression analysis indexing Shader and Enumclaw’s interconnected output. Attributing their similarity to the shared frigid and rainy climate, their regions’ insular isolationism from their respective country’s centers of power, or simply their comparable latitude levels leave a lot to be desired. We would rather invite you to delve into the sonic material to make head or tails of this improbable kinship alongside the North England-Washington state axis. Start with—and for now, stick to—their inaugural full length albums: while there is about an additional ten minutes of runtime on the English indie rockers’ project (46 minutes packed into twelve records, versus Enumclaw’s 36 in eleven), there is an immediacy of impact whose deduction is undeniable.\n\nThere is something uniquely glamorous and affable in how Oasis presents itself as the center of a phantasmagoric venn diagram between a band hailing from the industrious and sullen birthplace of grunge music, and another cut from the working class cloth of a sanctuary as stricken by its secondary economic sector heritage as it is placed on the global artistic map by the force of post-punk. If anything, such disparate premises speak to the gelling power and impact of the enterprise the Gallaghers created—while it might be true that no check can be fat enough for Noel to acquiesce to a forced industry-planted reunion, for now their musical legacy rests in good reincarnated hands.\n\nWe’d like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and we hope to feel your interest again next time.\n\nAV\n\nBelow listed are Shader’s complete works since 2020:\n\nShader\n\nStu Whiston (vocals, guitars)\n\nMike Lo Bosco (guitars)\n\nDaz Edwards (bass)\n\nTommy Turney (drums)\n\nStudio albums\n\nEverything Is Connected (2022)\n\nSingles\n\nStreets Tell Stories (2021)\n\nRunaway (2021)\n\nDon’t You (Forget About Me) [2020]\n\nTrue to Life (2020)\n\nLately (Demo) [2020]\n\nTime Is Right (2020)\n\nBe My Saviour (2020)\n\nBelow listed are Enumclaw’s complete works since 2021:\n\nEnumclaw\n\nAramis Johnson (vocals, guitars)\n\nNathan Cornell (guitars)\n\nEli Edwards (bass)\n\nLadaniel Gipson (drums)\n\nStudio albums\n\nSave the Baby (2022)\n\nEPs\n\nJimbo Demo (2021)\n\nSingles\n\n2002 (2022)"
