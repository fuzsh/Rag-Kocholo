Anything you post to a Community Forum is public, and others will have access to your User Submission(s) and may view, collect and use that information or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. We encourage you to think carefully before you post and to use caution before disclosing any personal information in Community Forums and other online communities. We may use Community Forum activity and information provided in User Submissions for the purposes of internal analytics and targeted marketing.\n\nWe may also enable you to post content from some of our Sites to your profile on other social networks. You can access these services from our Sites using Facebook Connect, Twitter, or other Open ID providers. These services will authenticate your identity and allow you to post and share certain personal or other information with that site. Please be aware that the privacy policy of that site or service will apply to any content you provide them in these instances. We do not allow these services to provide any personal information or content back to our Sites or your profile with us unless you agree.

You may have the opportunity to submit personal information, such as your email address, for collection through a widget. A widget may also use browser or Flash cookies and/or collect clickstream and usage data. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.\n\nTransactions\n\nYou may purchase artists’ music, subscribe to paid podcast content, or purchase merchandise from some of our Site(s) or our Artists’ or Podcasts’ Sites, in which case you may be directed to an externally hosted web page or site to complete your transaction. These sites will be clearly identified and link to their own privacy policies so you know which company is collecting your personal information. You should refer to those policies for any privacy-related concerns regarding your purchase or subscription.\n\nMonitoring and Fraud Prevention\n\nTo help protect you and others, we monitor use of the Sites and we use the information we collect, including personal information, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Sites; ensure compliance with the applicable terms of service and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of Sony Music, its partners and customers.

We or our partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests on our Sites and other sites, and across your different devices. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising please check your browser settings.\n\nMobile Marketing\n\nIf you choose to join a mobile marketing list, please be aware that there are usually costs associated with receiving SMS (text) or MMS (multimedia) messages depending on your wireless carrier and plan.

If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device or application level, as applicable. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.\n\nGeolocation\n\nIf you have previously enabled your computer or mobile device to send us location information, you may be able to opt-out from further allowing us to access such information by changing the settings on your computer or mobile device or by uninstalling the application.\n\nTracking Technologies\n\nWe and our business partners use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information.\n\nCookies are text files containing small amounts of coded information that are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each future visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies and similar technologies help us to improve our sites and to deliver a better and more personalized experience, for example, by storing information about how you use our sites and allowing us to recognize you when you return. You may refuse to accept cookies by changing the privacy settings on your internet browser but this can mean certain parts of our site may not work properly. We and our business partners may automatically or passively collect information as you browse our Site(s) such as connection information (including the domain name and Internet Service Provider), browser type and version, mobile device ID, cell phone carrier, operating system and device type, average time spent on our Site(s), pages viewed, traffic to and from the websites, information accessed, the IP address you use to connect to the Internet and related geographical information about your computer or mobile device, and advertising data and other standard weblog information. Such information is sometimes referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data.\n\n“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, pixel tags, GIFS or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed.\n\nThis information is used to make our Sites easier to use, improve our advertising and to provide you with a more personal and convenient experience. For example, we may use this information to store some of your preferences or to provide you with tailored advertisements related to your specific interests on our Sites and other sites, and across your different devices. Additionally, should you choose to enroll, we and our partners may use this information to allow you to participate in one of our fan rewards programs. To learn more about the use of cookies in online advertising, including how to manage or delete them click here.\n\nWe and some of our partners use Flash cookies to store some of your preferences or personal information. For more information on Flash cookies and how to manage privacy and storage settings click here.\n\nIn some of our email messages, we use “click-through URLs” or pixel tags to determine whether the email has been opened and to measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. This data may also be used to gauge your interest in particular topics, so we can deliver a more relevant, personal and convenient user-experience.\n\nOne analytics provider with whom we may work is Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Properties and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to http://google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and you can opt out of the service by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n\nManaging your cookies & tracking technology preferences\n\nTo manage your cookie preferences on our Sites, please refer to the “Manage Cookies” link in the cookie banner of the applicable Site.\n\nSome web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. When you choose to turn on the “Do Not Track” settings in your browser, your browser will send a signal to websites, analytics providers, advertisement networks, plug-in providers, and other web service providers you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.\n\nGlobal Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. To find out more about and to set up GPC, please visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about.\n\nOpting out of tracking or targeted advertising cookies doesn’t mean you won’t receive online advertising, just that the advertisements you see won’t be based on the website pages you’ve visited.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after receipt. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us by clicking here.\n\nLocation of Processing\n\nOur Sites are operated in the United States. If you are located in a jurisdiction outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be processed in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.\n\nPersonal Information Rights\n\nUnder applicable data protection laws, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information, such as the right to know about how we process your personal information, to access your personal information and obtain a copy of it or a portable version of it, to correct or delete your personal information, and to opt out of certain types of processing or sharing of personal information where applicable. Below, we provide information on how you may submit requests in relation to your personal information. Please also refer to the sections further below addressed to residents of California and Virginia for additional information.\n\nUpon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.\n\nOur Sites may offer different methods for updating your personal information.

Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California section of this Privacy Policy have the same meanings given in the CCPA, unless otherwise defined.\n\nWe collect the information described above in this Privacy Policy (including identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity, and in certain circumstances Sensitive Personal Information such as account log-in / password, ethnicity, health information, financial account information, social security, driver’s licence, ID or passport number, or specific geolocation data) from fans and consumers (including job applicants), artists, podcast hosts and producers, business partners, clients, vendors, other applications (e.g., social networks), advertising networks and digital service providers. The Personal Information we collect about you will depend upon how you use our Sites or otherwise interact with us. In addition to the categories of data described above, we may collect and/or use additional types of information and will do so after providing notice to you and obtaining your consent to the extent such notice and consent is required by the CCPA.\n\nWe may use this information for any of the business purposes described above. We may also share this information with the following categories of third parties: Sony Music and affiliated companies, artists, podcast producers, independent artist and label clients, advertising networks, digital service providers and other business partners for such business purposes.\n\nIn addition to the sources and categories of third parties mentioned above, we also may share this information with law enforcement and professional service companies for the limited purposes of addressing our compliance and legal obligations and exercising our legal rights.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Rights\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, California residents have the following rights:\n\nAccess and portability. Upon a verifiable request, California residents can request information regarding what personal information we collect, use, or disclose, and other information about our data practices, including the right to request we provide you with the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, and the categories of sources of such personal information and the categories of external recipients to which such personal information is disclosed (but not the individual sources or recipients);\n\nPlease note, the CCPA’s right to obtain copies does not grant a right to the whole of any document that contains personal information about you, but only to copies of “specific pieces” of such personal information;\n\nIn order to provide specific pieces of information about you, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.\n\nDeletion. Request deletion of the personal information we maintain about you;\n\nPlease note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.\n\nCorrection. Request correction of inaccurate personal information we maintain about you; and\n\n“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal information”. You may request to opt out of the “sale” or the “sharing” of your personal information to third parties for cross-contextual behavioural advertising (i.e. targeted advertising), whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nWe do not sell your personal information to third parties for money or other valuable consideration. However, Sony Music engages in online advertising practices (and certain analytics or similar activities) whereby we share personal information with other companies and service providers in compliance with the law in order to deliver more meaningful ads and other communications to consumers, and for other similar reasons provided in this Privacy Policy. These practices may be considered a “share” for cross-context behavioural advertising as defined in the CCPA.\n\nCalifornia residents have the right to opt-out of this information “sharing” (as defined in the CCPA). If you wish to exercise this right, please complete the form here or call the following toll-free number: 1-833-380-0676. To the extent that you elect to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, they must select “An Authorized Representative” on the form. We will not share the personal information of California minors who are under the age of 16 with third parties for commercial purposes without affirmative consent, which can be provided at the point of data collection.\n\nTo disable sharing through cookies set by third parties that may be considered “sharing” under the CCPA, please refer to the “Manage Cookies” link in the cookie banner of the applicable Site.\n\nIn addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA to opt out of the sharing of personal information by some or all of the participating companies. For more information, visit: https://www.privacyrights.info/.\n\nRight to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information\n\nUnder the CCPA Regulations, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information when such use does not fall within the list of exceptions outlined in CCPA § 7027, subsection (l). Sony Music’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information falls within this list of exceptions, and we therefore do not offer such opt-out right at this time.\n\nExercising other California Consumer Rights\n\nIf you are a California resident and wish to exercise any of these rights, please: (a) contact us here with the specific nature of your request, referencing “Your California Privacy Rights”; or (b) call the following toll-free number: 1-833-380-0676. When submitting your request, you must affirm that you are a California resident or an authorized representative for a California resident, and provide enough information for us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or their authorized representative. All requests should be properly labelled and contain all the necessary information so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to the request.\n\nAuthorized agents must be registered with the California Secretary of State, and the consumer must designate the authorized agent by providing the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney or written permission to act for the consumer. We will follow up with authorized agents to request this documentation. Such written permission must state the agent’s full legal name, the full legal name of the applicable consumer, and a clear description of the permission granted. Alternatively, an authorized agent may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. The consumer’s identity, in addition to the authorized agent’s identity, will need to be independently verified for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty or we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.\n\nIn respect of Californian residents’ rights of access and portability, deletion and correction, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide, and you may be asked to provide additional proof of identification so that we can verify your identity and validate the request. If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity. Pursuant to the CCPA, we will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise your rights to opt out of the sharing of your personal information or to limit the use & disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information (if the same becomes applicable).\n\nSubmitting a request under the CCPA does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use any additional information you provide as part of your request to verify your identity. Please note that you are limited by law in the number of requests you may submit per year. We will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of products, based solely upon you exercising your rights under the CCPA.\n\nRetention\n\nWe will retain your information for as long as your account is active and as needed to provide you services, or otherwise to fulfil the purpose(s) for which your information was collected. We will use and retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\n\nCalifornia “Shine the Light”\n\nIf you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 provides you the right to receive: (a) information identifying any third party(ies) to whom we may have disclosed, within the preceding calendar year, your personal information for that third party’s direct marketing purposes; and (b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information free of charge, please write to us at the address below, or submit your request here. We will respond to these requests within thirty (30) days. Requests that come to us by other means may result in a delayed response.\n\nAdditional Information for Virginia Residents\n\nWe set forth above in this Privacy Policy the categories of personal data (as defined under Virginia law) we process, the purpose for processing personal data, the categories of personal data shared, and the categories of third parties with whom personal data is shared.\n\nIf you are a Virginia consumer (as defined under Virginia law) and would like to exercise your rights pursuant to the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder (“VCDPA”), to submit a request please complete this form or call the following toll-free number: 1-833-380-0676.\n\nVirginia Consumers have the following rights, all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the VCDPA:\n\nAccess.
