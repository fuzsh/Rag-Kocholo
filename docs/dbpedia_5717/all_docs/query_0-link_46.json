        "text": "Taking on jobs that are part science lab, part hay bailer, and part marketing director, son and father Matt & William Williams make up the dream team behind Shroom Champ Mushrooms. Matt studied biology in school and has always been fascinated by mushrooms, which seem to live somewhere between the plant and animal kingdoms. He started using his biology skills to grow mushrooms about 10 years ago, but it wasn’t until his dad, William, suggested that he start his own business that Shroom Champ was born.\n\nMichael Pinckney started Pinckney Cookie Café 2009 from his creativity and passion for cooking and baking – his business card even says Cookie Monster. He bakes cookies from all natural decadent ingredients, no preservatives and gourmet chocolate - creations that last best in the refrigerator. And, wanting to be inclusive, Michael created his special \"Miracle Cookies\" that are both vegan and gluten-free and absolutely delicious. He currently sells his amazing cookies in both the West Seattle and University District Farmers Markets and as well as online. He shares some tips and ideas for making the best cookies.\n\nWhen Anna Sugiyama launched Yoka Miso in 2019, her traditionally made misos sold out within an hour of her site going live. She managed to sell out without a huge advertising campaign, press release, or viral social post. Anna’s business was supported by her community, and that strong connection to her community continues to be a driving force behind her business, “We support our community and then the people who want to do that also support us, so it’s this cycle of people just uplifting each other,” Anna says.\n\nWe are pleased to introduce the chefs who will be participating in An Incredible Feast this year!\n\nAn Incredible Feast features some of Seattle’s most talented and innovative chefs, paired with market farmers to create an incredible feast of unique and delicious bites, showcasing fresh farm ingredients.\n\nOur vendors are the foundation of the work we do, and one of our goals for 2023 was to provide space for emerging and BIPOC farmers and vendors across all of our markets, with a focus on the brand-new Capitol Hill Tuesday Market (Tuesdays, 3-7pm, until September 26). This year we’ve brought in a record number of new producers, and we are so thrilled to have each and every one of them in our markets. Learn more about Neighborhood Farmers Market’s 2023 first-year vendors!\n\nThe markets wouldn’t be what they are today without the farmers and vendors who are at the core of everything we do. Seventeen local produce farmers were on site on opening day in 1993…and 600 shoppers. It was a small (but strong) beginning for NFM, which currently supports 7 markets (3 of which go year-round), and some of those vendors remain staples of our markets today, 30 years later! Thank you to all the farmers and vendors who have been a part of our mission since day one:\n\nSyd Suntha is the Seattle food scene’s jack of all trades. He’s been in the game for years, and has gained loyal fans, followers, and friends every step of the way, with each new unique project exposing him to a new audience of Seattle foodies. “I hear it, because people are like ‘oh that’s the guy from Skillet,’ ‘Oh that’s the Wu Tang guy,’ ‘I think I’ve seen that dude on Instagram,’” Syd explains. “I’ve been around so long working at different restaurants.”\n\nNFM: Tell us a little bit about yourself. Who are you? What do you do?\n\nDylan: My name is Dylan. I am a first-year market manager coming in to manage the Phinney Farmers Market. I have a long background in the farmers markets, working for a variety of the different vendors here in Seattle. The vendor I've worked with the most is River Run farm out of Sequim. So I was more or less their Seattle manager, so managing their Community Supported Agriculture Farm box, which is like a delivery program in the neighborhoods around Seattle, as well as all their market booths. But I've worked with a number of our other vendors as well. Tin Dog Brewing, SnoValley Mushrooms; I worked on their farm for a little bit; Brothers and Company; I did some catering events with them. So I've worked with quite a few of them. Before coming to the markets, I attended law school at the University of Washington and found my way into the Farmers Market community through a passion for food and the great community we have here in the farmers markets.\n\nCommunity is at the core of everything Kaffeeklatsch does. It’s even in the name; “Kaffeeklatsch” is German for “A social gathering around coffee.” When Annette Heide-Jessen and her partner opened Kaffeeklatsch in 2011, it was to fill the void of community that they felt was missing in their Lake City neighborhood. There was no other locally-owned coffeeshop in the neighborhood, so they decided to create the ‘third place’ that they had been searching for."
