        "text": "CoRK EAST, STUDIO 2\n\nSoul-stirring, interdisciplinary work has garnered Al Letson national recognition, critical acclaim and devoted fans. Early in his career, Letson established himself as a heavyweight in the Poetry Slam Movement, which reaped artistic credibility and renown. He has performed on a number of national, regional and local stages, including such venues as HBO’s Def Poetry Jam, and CBS’s 2004 Final Four PreGame.\n\nIn 2008, Letson was one of three finalists out of more than 1,500 applicants to win the Public Radio Talent Quest. The Talent Quest is an effort by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to find new voices and innovative programming to launch nationally on public radio. Letson’s program “State of the Re:Union” is gearing up for a full season of 12 episodes and a robust multimedia campaign that will launch in February with a Black History Month. Produced by the Public Radio Exchange and distributed by National Public Radio, State of the Re:Union travels to an American city or town to discover the interesting things that people are doing to create community and transcend their circumstances, while placing focus on the vital cultural narratives.\n\nIn addition to the radio show, Letson works as a professional playwright, and actor. Drawing on his background as a performance poet, Letson seamlessly weaves spoken word into the fabric of his theatre work His solo play, Summer in Sanctuary, will be produced off Broadway by The Abingdon Theatre Company at the Dorothy Strelsin Theatre. The Baltimore Sun said, “Letson is a powerful performer who tells his story by moving fluidly from one role to the next.”\n\nWhile his many interests are diverse, the common theme in Letson’s work is his effort to bring people together. By examining difficult topics and influential historical themes, Letson strives to focus on our common humanity—and always present a production with consummate artistry.\n\nVisit Al's website\n\nErrthang Show\n\nState of the Re:Union\n\nCoRK WEST, STUDIO 6\n\nAvondale Artworks, located in the CoRK Arts District in Jacksonville, Florida, provides archival quality custom picture framing, art installation, and periodic exhibitions in various venues.

For over two decades, Barbara has written, directed, produced, and performed socially engaged theater that contributes to vital conversations in the Jacksonville community. Through the practice of storytelling, she engages performers and audiences in examining complex themes in much more nuanced ways than our local and national discourses often allow.\n\nHer studio at CoRk Arts District is called BABS’LAB. BABS'LAB is a space for creating in the NOW. It's a place for experimentation, training, and performance, a place where the community comes together to witness work that uplifts, breaks barriers, and crosses lines. Our monthly STORY SLAMS, incredibly intimate evenings of live storytelling, are packed out! A story slam is a friendly competition similar to poetry slams. Storytellers have 5 minutes each to tell a TRUE personal story based on a THEME chosen for the event without the use of notes.\n\nBarbara’s company Improv to the Rescue specializes in experiential and creative learning to enhance communication skills, develop storytellers and encourage collaboration through workshops, classes and coaching. A 2013 TEDxJacksonville Speaker, Barbara was voted Best Actor by Folio Weekly’s 2016 Best of Jax readership.\n\ncontact: babslab@barbaracolaciello.com\n\nCoRK East, Studio 2\n\nSome common synonyms for the phrase “black eye” are blemish, shiner, dishonor, disgrace and shame. None of these are really appealing so I decided to take a more liberal approach to how I define the Blakeye. My heritage is interwoven with Black and Spanish roots by way of Panama where my father introduced me to the world of photography and graphic design at an early age. I was taught that art comes from within and the manner in which we choose to express that creativity will ultimately become our avatar in society. With that being said, I find it ironic that my love of comics, anime, video games, action figures and Hip-Hop became the foundation from which my own Blakeyes were formed.\n\n​ The blending of action figures and Hip-Hop is not new, but I’d like to think that my vision of it adds something different to the mix. I make music, take pictures of toys and sometimes create visuals to capture moments when my energy dictates. After years of procrastination and self doubt, I am now at a place in time where I felt it was necessary to have my own space to share my perspective and allow it room to resonate.\n\nVisit Arsun’s website\n\nIG: @arsunfist\n\nEmail Arsun\n\nCoRK WEST, STUDIO 4\n\nVisual Artist / Gardener / Naturalist\n\nStudio Director for CoRK Arts District\n\nContact: crystal@crystalfloyd.com or corkdistrictevents@gmail.com\n\nPhoto credits: Jesse Brantman for studio shots & Amy Ploss Samson for artwork images\n\nAvailable for Commissions\n\nAs a visual artist and aspiring naturalist native to Northeast Florida, Crystal Floyd’s work explores themes of nature, storytelling, and adaptive reuse, transforming collected ephemera and manipulated materials into naturalistic vignettes. Drawing inspiration from the environment and science, she uses preserved insects, plants, taxonomic items, natural artifacts, miniatures and found objects to activate magical narratives. Her practice focuses on encouraging observation and participation in the natural world and closer examination of the individual role and responsibilities we all have to our environment.\n\nIn addition to exhibiting personal work and completing commissioned projects, she regularly teaches public and private terrarium construction, art assemblage and gardening workshops at various museums, art venues and gardens. Her goal is to have her work evoke a sense of connection and wonder in the viewer, hopefully causing a ripple effect of increased compassion, creative thinking and caring.\n\nCrystal serves as Studio Director and works from her art space at CoRK Arts District, a large warehouse facility that houses gallery & work space for over 60 artists. Her pieces were recently featured at the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens during the Community Foundation of Northeast Florida ArtVentures Anniversary Exhibition in early 2021 and were on view in their Concourse Gallery from September 2020 through February 2021. She was recently featured in Void Magazine’s February 2021 Issue.\n\nSince 2015, Crystal has also filled the role of bimonthly visual arts curator for all three Bold Bean Coffee Roasters locations. Her exhibition at the Thomas Center Gallery’s 2017 juried show, “Cross Creek Rising: The Consciousness of Land and Water,” received an Honorable Mention. Her work has appeared nationally, most recently in shows at Light Grey Art Lab (Minneapolis, MN), the Gallery at Avalon Island (Orlando, FL), Flower Pepper Gallery (Pasadena, CA), and other locations in the United States. Locally, she has recently had her work on view in the offices of the City Council and had work on display for six months in the concourse gallery of the Jacksonville International Airport.\n\nCrystal is a recipient of a 2013 ArtVentures Individual Artist Grant from the Community Foundation of Northeast Florida and a Community First Cares Grant in 2018. Her exhibition with fellow artist Eric Gillyard, entitled \"Dark Nature,\" won Folio's Best of Jax award for Best Art Exhibition of 2012 and her work was featured in a an article and on the cover of Folio's Fall Arts Issue in September 2017. She received an Executive Certificate in Arts and Culture Strategy through the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice | NAS in October 2019.\n\nComprehensive CV available upon request\n\nVisit Crystal's site\n\nCoRK NORTH, STUDIO M\n\nDoug Eng is a fine art photographer and installation artist whose specialties are urban and natural landscapes.\n\nAn engineer by education and trade, Eng is pursuing a lifelong interest in the visual arts and has established a reputation for unique imagery and meaningful public projects. “My visual fascination with my surroundings, whether built or natural, comes from many years of trying to understand why things are what they are. An engineering discipline seeks to explain and rationalize the world, and to develop solutions to problems. My curiosity about forms, structures, patterns, rhythms, and textures, is a natural outgrowth of the need to find order in all things. But it is chaotic randomness that creates uniqueness and vitality. Our world is both simple and complex, structured and random, free and bound…all in a simultaneous expression of what IS. This is my realization through my art and these are the subjects of my investigations.”\n\nVisit Doug's site\n\nCoRK North, Studio H\n\nErica Saffer is an accomplished writer, educator, storyteller, and literary arts advocate from Jacksonville, Florida, where she resides with her three children.

The Los Angeles Times said that in her work “you find yourself looking at these everyday plastic objects in a whole new way.”\n\nShuttleworth’s work ranges from large ten-foot landscapes to intimate miniature dioramas. Some of her pieces are composed of over 10,000 hand-cut shards of safety cones, forming a dazzling mosaic of dream-like landscapes.\n\nFor over 20 years Shuttleworth has been playing with the potential of a plastic cone beyond directing traffic. And her playful yet arresting work makes us realize their potential as well … Her tranquil scenes of Klimt-inspired parks and Japanese-inspired cherry blossoms evoke a humanless, pure natural state. Yet the mosaics of found objects show plastics are often buried deep in our natural and cultural landscapes, even if we do not notice them. Shuttleworth creates an interesting but not incongruous relationship between nature and consumption, asking where found and recycled objects fit into this spectrum.\n\n-- Priscilla Frank, The Huffington Post\n\nHer artwork was featured on the quiz show, Jeopardy, and she has been the cover artist on numerous magazines and art journals.

He has been immersed in the world of visual and performing art since a the age of 5, first developing his passion for creativity while attending Lake Forest elementary, school of the arts.\n\nThis early and consistent exposure to the arts revealed a pervasive lack of representation with regards to both the creators and subjects of the most well known and highly regarded works of art. This observation heavily influences Williams' decision to exclusively depict members of the African diaspora, primarily its female members, and to do so with a reverential approach prevalent in the work he grew up learning about. He also creates work designed to evoke a shift in perspective around issues of historical oppression and continued injustices.\n\nWilliams' professional career began in 2011 after earning a degree in philosophy from the University of Florida and moving back to Jacksonville. Early on, his work was largely observational rather than conceptual and consisted of mostly charcoal and graphite. Over time, his preferred medium gradually shifted towards acrylic paint, allowing for the exploration of wide range concepts and techniques. This shift led to an experimental method of creating, where each successive piece builds on the trials and errors of previous works. Abstraction, blurring the boundaries between foreground and background, and exploring different application methods are some of the tools employed in his constantly evolving process. Whereas his early work centered around the accurate depiction of subjects, his current work seeks to interpret them in more thoughtful and creative ways.\n\nWilliams' work has been exhibited in galleries and museums locally and internationally and has been featured in various publications including, EU Jacksonville, Folio Weekly, Worthy Magazine, Arbus Magazine, and Modish Affairs. He currently has work in various private collections and works out of his studio in the Cork Arts District in his hometown of Jacksonville.\n\nEmail Marcus\n\nCoRK NORTH, STUDIO G\n\nMary O. Smith received her Bachelor of Design in 1982 from Louisiana State University.

She is a founding and current board member of Pines & Palms. She was invited to be faculty at Plein Air South in 2021 and Ambassador for the Forgotten Coast Plein Air event in Apalachicola in 2022. She is one of the featured artists for the High Cotton Paint Out in Thomasville, GA. She enjoys sharing her love of painting and the inspiration of Southern subjects; boats, oaks with moss, historical landmarks.\n\nMary O. will say that her highest achievement thus far is winning the Artist Choice Award at the Shadows on the Teche event 2021. She won Louisiana Beauty Award 2023 at the Shadows event. Her motto that she tries to reinforce as of late, is “A little planning is planning to succeed”.\n\nArtist Statement\n\nAs an artist. I am always reaching for the next level of growth and expressing myself through color and form using subject matter. I have gained a wealth of knowledge through the teachings of accomplished artists and through my own work in the studio and plein-air painting. I hope through my own teaching I can inspire other artists to reach their goals. I start each painting with a plan of values and shapes to achieve the composition that reveals my feelings and inspirations of the scene. Whether painting in oil or watercolor, I am figuring out the best method for designing my work. I want my work to have expressive lines and movement, but through a well thought out format. I love painting in plein-air. It comes with many challenges: weather conditions, hot or humid, cold and windy. I love creating a painting that coveys something about the day that I encountered and the shapes that caught my attention. I use the moment to inspire me.\n\nLiving near the gulf coast has a wealth of marine subjects; working boats, shrimp boats, boats in dry storage. Moss covered oaks are among the wonderful subjects of the area. With a background in architectural rendering, finding an interesting building is just an added bonus. I fall in love with each area that I paint.\n\nYou can find more of her work in oils, watercolor, and gouache on her website, www.maryosmith.com.\n\nFacebook: Studio by Mary O\n\nInstagram: @mary.o.smith\n\nEmail: maryo@maryosmith.com\n\nCoRK EAST, STUDIO 3\n\nMary St. Germain is an American Visual Artist based in Jacksonville, Florida.

Enjoying the breadth of working between genres: still life, nature, landscape, and botanicals, the ebb and flow of my personal life guides the journey.\n\nMy work is typically nature based, a recent breast cancer journey along with my primary caretaker role has proven to reinforce and stimulate that interest. Nature, for me, acts as healer, supporter, and spiritual energy source. I explore and manipulate color complexions to capture the essence of our environment, often employing calligraphic line as an element. Walking through the wildflowers, entranced by the winged things , discovering the complexities and interaction of nature, man, and our spiritual existence. I am thankful to observe the waning of life and excited by the seeds of new beginnings.\n\nIt is my belief that art and nature are the catalysts to the healing process of the human spirit, lifting our thoughts and emotions to levels that transform our physical and spiritual wellbeing.\n\nVisit Mary's site\n\nCoRK EAST, STUDIO 7\n\nRakimism Photography LLC\n\nLifestyle Photographer\n\nFirst name Wesly while my second middle name “Rakim” stems from the 90’s hip-hop artist, ode to my mothers taste in music.

I am creating to be present in my body. I am creating to have a better understanding of the parts inside that can only be discovered through a sense of mental displacement.

I believe I am looking for an emotional connection, a certain action that speaks to our humanity, our biography, our wit, and I want to say it with subtle but universally recognizable human gestures and nuanced body language. Because I choose to paint people and their emotions, I have often been called a romantic, trying to only paint and draw beautiful things. Sometimes this is true – I like to accentuate the beautiful in an often ugly world – but I’m not naïve. I also want my art to reflect my time and my truth. This is a truth in metaphor only because the idea of a naturalistic painting as something other than illusion is laughable. It is a lie by nature. A lie made beautiful, poignant or ugly by the artist. I am interested in this beautiful lie and how I can use it to find my place in the vast representation of the human in art.”\n\nVisit Tony's site"
