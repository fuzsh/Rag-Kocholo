All requests for RIAA Gold & Platinum Program certifications should be sent to certifications@riaa.com for approval with the following information filled out in the RIAA – Certification Request Excel (available to download here). All required information must be complete in the Excel for a certification request to be accepted by the RIAA.\n\n2. Please familiarize yourself with the Glossary tab in the Excel document and reach out to certifications@riaa.com with any questions.\n\n3. Beginning with the Contact Info sheet, please fill out every field. The Requested By information is the point of contact during the certification process for any questions from either the RIAA or our auditors. If the Billing Contact and Requested By contact are the same person, please enter the information in both fields. Please note, only one invoice will be generated per request template. If you need multiple invoices for multiple artists, you will need to submit multiple Excel templates.\n\nOn the Certification Request sheet, please fill out every field. If you have any questions about what information is required for the field, you can refer to either the Glossary sheet or the hover box that appears when the header field is selected. Please select the highest Certification Status Level that you are requesting (Gold, Platinum, or Multi-Platinum) as well as listing the Requested Level (0.5 for Gold/Oro, 1 for Platinum/Platino, 2 or higher for the requested level of Multi-Platinum/Multi-Platino). Please note, when calculating the Requested Level for a Latin certification, the Latin thresholds are different/lower, and can be found at riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards or on the Glossary sheet of the request template.\n\nIf you are unsure of if your title has been certified before, you can check the riaa.com/gold-platinum database. Please note, any certifications your label has asked to embargo will not appear on the riaa.com website until the label contact requests them to be included. If you would like your certification to remain hidden from our website upon completion of audit, please select YES in the Hidden column.\n\nIf every field is not correctly completed on the request form, your request will not be approved and you will be notified by a representative from the RIAA.\n\nYou may submit multiple Titles for certification on the request template and receive a bulk discount. The discount only applies to Titles that have the same billing contact, are submitted on one request, and can be on one invoice. For more information on the bulk discount, please email certifications@riaa.com.\n\n4. Please copy our Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman (GR&F) auditors on all certification correspondence. If you are on the east coast, please email copy RIAAEastCoast@grfllp.com. If you are on the West Coast, please email copy RIAAWestCoast@grfllp.com.\n\nAll supporting documentation must be provided to both the RIAA and GR&F when submitting the RIAA Certification Request Template.\n\nSupporting Documentation includes the following:\n\nSales Report\n\nDirectly from the Sales System – Domestic Shipments Only, Net of Returns\n\nIf Excel data is provided as sales support please provide a Screen shot of the Sales System, as well.\n\n*Sales Reports may be subject to additional testing at the auditor’s discretion\n\nLabel Copies for all UPC’s (Album requests) or ISRC’s (Digital Single requests). Sometimes referred to as a ‘one-sheet,’ ‘white sheet,’ ‘product report,’ or ‘product metadata,’ a label copy is a report for every UPC/ISRC containing information about the album or track, such as: Artist, Title, Version Description (e.g. Album, Radio Edit, Remix, Live, Acoustic, etc.), Product Number (UPC/ISRC), Runtime, Credits, etc.\n\nCopy of the Physical Product (if applicable) OR digital files of tracks/albums sent via email.\n\nEast Coast GR&F:\n\nGelfand Rennert & Feldman, LLC\n\nAttn: Michael Obrycki\n\n149 5th Avenue, Suite 1101\n\nNew York, NY 10010\n\nRIAAEastCoast@grfllp.com\n\nWest Coast GR&F:\n\nGelfand, Rennert & Feldman, LLC\n\nAttn: Paul Fischer\n\n1880 Century Park East, #1600\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\n\nRIAAWestCoast@grfllp.com\n\nRIAA:\n\nRIAA, Attn: Erin Burr\n\n1000 F St NW, 2nd floor\n\nWashington, DC 20004\n\ncertifications@riaa.com\n\nOnce all required documentation is provided, the RIAA will approve your request for certification by emailing you and our GR&F auditors to proceed with the audit process.\n\nHave questions?
