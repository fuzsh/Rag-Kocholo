        "text": "Without being prompted to do so, the Neighbourhood drummer Bryan Sammis offers up the usual laundry list of umbrella genres and seminal bands when the subject of his group’s sound comes up.\n\n“We’re an amalgamation of a lot of different music types,” the timekeeper says, on the line from a New York City tour stop. “We all love hip-hop, which is where the backbone of a lot of our songs comes from—the drums and the bass and stuff. Some of the guys are really into old-school rock ’n’ roll, like Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, and the Stones. Some come from a little bit of a heavier background: Pantera, Black Sabbath, and Slayer. I grew up listening to Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, and stuff like that. I think all that comes through in our music.”\n\nActually, it doesn’t at all, which isn’t to suggest that Sammis is a liar, but is more a sign that the Neighbourhood is one of those pop-music rarities: a band that really doesn’t sound like anyone else. The Los Angeles–based quintet’s debut disc, the Sony-released I Love You., might be the most original major-label release of the year, the otherworldly postpop songs all deliciously over-processed drums, monochromatic synths, and film-noir guitars. Even the acoustic six-string sounds like it was run through an effects pedal with a name like Bristol Trip-Hop, which is most evident on the breakout hit “Sweater Weather”.\n\nThat the Neighbourhood doesn’t really fit into any defined musical microniche might easily have spelled trouble from a marketing standpoint, considering that the group seemed to come out of nowhere. On the plus side, Sammis and his bandmates­—guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margott, and pinup-perfect singer Jesse Rutherford—had a pretty good idea what they were doing in terms of creating an image for themselves: all promo shots of the group, for example, are taken in stylized black and white, which is also a reflection of the band’s choice of clothes.\n\nThe problem was how to market the group at a time when getting the attention of the ADHD–afflicted music-buying public is more difficult than ever.\n\nSammis admits there were moments when the Neighbourhood wondered who exactly the band’s fans were going to be.\n\n“There’s obviously a worry with this, that because no one knows how to categorize it, people aren’t going to get it or have any idea what it is,” the drummer says. “But I think that’s the beauty of what we are doing. We’re being played on alternative radio stations, which we didn’t really expect, and we’re being played on pop radio stations, which is more along the lines of what we expected.”\n\nToday, the Neighbourhood has all the signs of a band on the rise, which explains why the group’s upcoming Vancouver show was bumped up to the Commodore from Venue after it quickly sold out. It’s all enough to make Sammis glad that he dropped out of university to pursue his musical dreams, a decision that was, funnily enough, made easier by some advice from the dean of the New Orleans school he was attending.\n\n“He told me to drop out,” the drummer says. “He was like, ‘You should go do this. If it doesn’t work out, come back—you can talk to me, I’ll let you back in, and you can finish things up.’ I’d played him some of our tunes, and for him to have such faith in what we were doing, and faith in me as a musician, was really inspiring.”"
