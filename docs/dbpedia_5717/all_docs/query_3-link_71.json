If I search by record label, it seems to only show results in my library (local and Qobuz albums I’ve added to my library). The same happens if I click on the record label link under credits.\n\nI understand that finding albums in Roon outside your library is a feature some/a lot of Roon users would like.\n\nHowever, trying to be helpfull on this forum, I see more and more people struggling with discovering and testing Roon, as it is already a complex application with a lot of functionalities in different areas - content, distribution, DSP, metadata, …\n\nIs it really that important that one can do everything from Roon, making it a real All-in-one music management system?\n\nAbout a week ago there was another topic about looking for albums of a specific label on Qobuz (as the topic starter is requesting)\n\nYou can do this on either the Qobuz app or the Qobuz website without any problem. Albums you would like to be added to your library just be hearting them in Qobuz.\n\n(Or you can listen to them in Roon directly if you do a search for the album you discovered in Qobuz).\n\nPersonally, I am going back and forward between Roon and Qobuz, because sometimes Qobuz offers more simple or extended functionalities.\n\nIf Roon would have to implement all of these functionalities, and do the same for Tidal, where would it stop?\n\nDirk\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, using the Search feature in the Qobuz app to search labels is pretty hit or miss. However, I just discovered somewhat of a work around to get Qobuz to display all albums from a particular label.\n\nIn the Qobuz app, select any album by the label you are looking for.\n\nOn the album page, select the 3 dots in the upper right corner.\n\nSelect “Album Credits”.\n\nThen click on the label name. Qobuz will then list the albums available under that label.\n\nThis isn’t as convenient as using the Search function, but the results are much better."
