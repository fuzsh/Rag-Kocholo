        "text": "Alamy\n\nSpread the love\n\nJesse Rutherford, singer-songwriter-producer of the Neighbourhood, has signed a solo deal with Atlantic Records.\n\nOperating under the name Jesse®, he will return with two new songs, Joker and Rainbow, to be released at 12pm. ET on Tuesday (28 March). A full-length solo album is due later this year.\n\n“It’s been a minute since I’ve shared anything,” Jesse® said. “It feels like I moved away from home & got a new phone number. This is my message letting you know I’m back in town & trying to get together.”\n\n“I’ve been an avid fan of Jesse’s career for more than a decade, both with The Neighbourhood and as a solo artist, and I’ve always been hoping we could find a way to bring him into the Atlantic family,” said Julie Greenwald, chairman & CEO of Atlantic Music Group. “Jesse’s an incredibly talented performer and songwriter with a clear creative vision, and I believe that everything he’s done so far has been leading up to this moment. Jesse’s new music takes him to a whole new level, and all of us at Atlantic are thrilled to partner with him on this exciting new chapter of his journey.”\n\nHot on the heels of the release of Joker and Rainbow, Jesse® is set to headline the first night of The Vigil, the two-night inaugural event presented by Bad Habit, which will take place at Los Angeles’ Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on 4 and 5 April."
