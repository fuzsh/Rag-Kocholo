        "text": "THE SPACEFLIGHT MISSION\n\nThe Spaceflight Mission is to develop, promote, and advance the careers of musicians and recording artists. We believe stripping down the economic barriers to promoting, manufacturing, and distributing music will increase representation, diversity, and access to the industry. Spaceflight provides an equitable recording contract with ancillary benefits to developing artists. This helps produce both cultural and artistic significance while promoting the financial stability of the musician. We provide record label services, distribution, public relations, radio promotion, legal counsel, and artist development.\n\nARTIST DEVELOPMENT\n\nSpaceflight Records’ first tier of programming works with artists who have finished recording an album and offers development and record label services that include PR, distribution, radio promotion, legal counsel, and release management. The Artist Development Program fosters a collaborative and individualized approach to release management, ensuring musicians play an equal role in shaping their musical journey by providing business development opportunities and invaluable industry insights.\n\nARTIST FELLOWSHIP\n\nSpaceflight Records’ Artist Fellowship offers comprehensive services encompassing manufacturing, international physical distribution, promotion, legal counsel, and release management. Designed for artists making significant career waves, the fellowship allows artists to reach a wider audience. The artist receives full record label services with ancillary benefits including vinyl records. Artists receive 100% of royalties and have no recoupment costs for manufacturing or services provided. The fellowship works as an incubator giving up to $75,000 of earned royalties and services to emerging artists at a crucial time in their careers.\n\nEQUITABLE RECORDING CONTRACT\n\nSpaceflight Records offers an alternative to the traditional record label model for established artists by providing an equitable recording deal at significantly lower rates. Artists retain ownership of their music while benefiting from full-label support and other essential services. Artists retain 100% of digital streaming royalties and 75% of physical sales royalties. Other benefits include shorter licensing terms, transparent accounting practices, full creative control, and fair termination clauses. This is to help album sales and streams become more of a contributing factor in the monetary success of working musicians.\n\nCOLLABORATION SERIES\n\nSpaceflight Records’ Collaboration series is a limited edition program that enables artists to release passion projects. This creates cultural significance and community engagement while preserving underserved genres and artistic expression. After recoupment of manufacturing the artists retain 100% of the royalties.\n\nSYNC LICENSING\n\nSpaceflight provides non-exclusive sync licensing opportunities to artists who own their music. By creating a robust “one-stop” catalog of songs, Spaceflight makes it easy for music supervisors, filmmakers, and advertisers to obtain original music for their productions.\n\nSPACEFLIGHT SPEAKER SERIES"
