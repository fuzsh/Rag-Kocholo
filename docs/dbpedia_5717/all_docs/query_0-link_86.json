The cultural zeitgeist prompted a call to action, not only to rethink our policing, but also to examine larger systemic and institutionalized racism in our society. In urban planning circles, this discussion often begins with an examination of the role “redlining” maps created in the 1930s by the federal government, which controversially appraised lending risk with a racial lens, stigmatizing areas with Black residents, outlined in red, as risky for investment, and contributing to ensuing segregation. Through examination of the nation’s largest metropolis, New York, this thesis evaluates whether redlining was only one factor of government policy – federal or municipal – entrenching segregation in the landscape. Global and local spatial clustering and segregation measures were conducted in 10-year intervals from 1910 to 2020 to evaluate underlying shifts in the spatial patterns of Black and White population segments over time. Linear regression, spatial error, and spatial lag models were then constructed to evaluate the degree to which redlining, urban renewal designations, public housing concentrations, zoning designations and historic districting contributed to the spatial segregation of Black and White populations in three distinct years: 1960, 1990 and 2020. The findings showed each era of new urban planning policy contributed to persisting segregation. The findings also showed that oftentimes a new generation of policy would spatially reference a prior era, to the benefit or detriment of a particular population: Urban renewal designations mimicked redlined areas and disproportionately concentrated public housing into increasingly Black enclaves, while exclusionary zoning tools like single-family zoning, often mimicked the safest investment designations in redlining maps, prolonging the privilege of predominantly White communities.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMelissa Khatry\n\nRails to Trails Web Mapping Application for the Great Redwood Trails: Mapping Northern California’s Repurposed Trails\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, Jennifer Swift\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nMany online applications exist that allow users to search for hiking trails, but none have yet included the new Great Redwood Trail project that spans from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay in California. This “rails to trails” project is repurposing 320 miles of historic railway tracks in northwest California into public hiking trails. The new trails exemplify a positive relationship between human-created infrastructure and nature. Rather than creating more industrial waste, the Great Redwood Trail Agency is revitalizing the railway tracks for the purpose of promoting environmentalism and activeness in nature. For this project a mobile web mapping application was developed to familiarize hikers and the public with these trails. The Great Redwood Trail application provides and interactive digital map of the trails and includes relevant information and points of interest in surrounding areas aimed at stimulating the local economy, which is vital in garnering community support for trail development. Lastly, the app includes real-time wildfire information since this is now an incessant natural hazard in the Northern California region. Ultimately, this project aspires to showcase repurposed railways to hiking trails, promote local communities, and help ensure safety of app users.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAlejandra G. Lopez\n\nAssessing the Use of Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index to Estimate Chlorophyll-a Concentrations Using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI Imagery in the Salton Sea, California\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Yi Qi, Diana Ter-Ghazaryan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe Salton Sea is the largest body of water in the State of California and has experienced a decline in water quality within the last fifty years. This inland body of water serves as a reservoir for agricultural runoff and maintains high concentrations of pesticides and nutrients that place surrounding communities and ecological environments at risk. As a result of the degradation and eutrophic state of the Salton Sea, it is important to identify historical trends and methodologies that can be used for future water quality assessments. Traditional water quality assessments are conducted onsite and require extensive financial and human resources. In order to mitigate some of these costs while continuing to monitor water quality, more efficient assessment techniques must be explored. This study explores one such technique by examining the use of remote sensing techniques and the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) to assess chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Salton Sea from 2002 to 2020 using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imagery. To assess the accuracy of this method, the NDCI is compared against two-band and three-band algorithms proposed by literature. Results indicate that the NDCI has largely underestimate chlorophyll-a concentrations within the Salton Sea and has incorrectly suggested small variations across the temporal range. Linear regression results further reveal a weak linear regression between NDCI, 2BDA and 3BDA values and in-situ measurements.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nStacey Jennifer Miller\n\nTemporal Analysis of Soil Degradation in San Joaquin County, California: A Close Examination of Soil Erosion Using RUSLE\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Yi Qi, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nCritical topsoil is eroding at an alarming rate due to climate change and abrasive farming practices, with the United Nations predicting a catastrophic loss within the next 60 years. Losing nutritious topsoil, also known as soil (or land) degradation, will exasperate climate change and threaten global food security for a growing population that is expected to number at 9.7 billion by the year 2050. The greatest contributor to soil degradation is soil erosion, which is responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land. Within the United States, soil erosion is heavily overlooked in the agricultural sector of Central Valley of California (CA), which is the nation’s largest food producing and exporting state. Despite its’ importance, the Central Valley has not been seriously evaluated for soil erosion, even though it has been intensely cultivated for agriculture production for more than 70 years. This project’s aim is to understand how differing land management practices in agriculture, combined with climate change factors, can alter processes of soil erosion severity in an agricultural area. Evaluating the county of San Joaquin, CA, future estimates of soil erosion by water are investigating using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in R and ArcGIS Pro (v.2.8). RUSLE was calculated for the year 2021 for a present-day point of reference and future predictions were calculated for years 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2100. For each year, the RUSLE equation was calculated using three different types of support practices, including: strip cropping, contour cropping and terrace cropping. Results show that when including future precipitation patterns, the practice of strip cropping generates the most severe soil erosion for each study year, with terrace cropping generating the least. Overall, the findings demonstrate that if farmers continue to employ strip cropping as opposed to other conservation-based cropping practices, they will lose necessary nutritious topsoil in just one to two generations.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nRicardo Pardinez Montijo\n\nElectrocution Risk to Three California Bird Species: Golden Eagle, Common Raven, and Turkey Vulture\n\nAdvisor: John Wilson | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Travis Longcore\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJohn Siddhartha Pedigo\n\nCommute GeoCalculator: A GIS Server Extension for Comparing Automobile and Transit Travel Costs\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, John Wilson\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nMost research literature on aggregate travel behavior and the built environment indicates that a dense, mixed-use, and transit-friendly settlement pattern generates lower automobile miles travelled than a traditional suburban development. By the same comparison, a substantial portion of research shows that any shift away from this ideal neo-urbanist community to more general urbanized areas exhibits only marginal – if any – influence upon travel behavior. Additionally, the commuter who must traverse such complex urban landscapes lacks information about the daily end-to-end costs associated with each practical mode of travel. This project’s GIS service package models the costs of driving versus transit, in minutes and dollars, for individual commutes from the perspective of a traveler. To sufficiently provide these spatial results, a network dataset was constructed for each travel mode – driving and multimodal transit – in the central metropolitan area of Washington D.C. The applied variables for driving included the cost of fuel per mile, travel time, parking time, and average parking fee. For bus, rail and pedestrian modes, the variables include average transit fares, walking, waiting and in-vehicle times, as well as these same inputs applied to any transfers. Commute times are summarized for each mode alongside corresponding dollar totals. For this cost conversion, annual income is extracted from location-based probabilistic income in traveler demographic data provided by StreetLight Data, Inc. Through web services development this thesis investigates a new approach for web GIS to model travel-cost information for individual commutes. These interactive services facilitate several use cases for research and transportation management, particularly if applied to invoke a commuter’s quantitative and qualitative response to mode choice. Where uncertainty currently prevails in modeling travel behavior, such empirical mode-choice data volumes become quite valuable.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAmanda Rompala\n\nA Spatial Analysis of Beef Production and its Environmental and Health Impacts in Texas\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Robert Vos\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nNemanja Bisenic\n\nA Scenario Based Fire Susceptibility Approach for Remote Sensing Platform Comparison: Los Angeles County Area, Southern California, USA\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Elisabeth Sedano, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe fire season has lengthened as heat waves induced by global warming have created life treating conditions around the globe. One of the most affected regions is the West coast of the United States where, in particular, California experiences record breaking fires year after year. This trend is most likely to worsen in the following decades. In order to improve pre-fire detection, the remote sensing platforms use a combination of the integrated small satellites constellation and regular satellite platforms to provide an early warning system. The combined satellite early warning system relies on multispectral and multiresolution satellite networks. This statement of research proposes a fire susceptibility scenario that will attempt to delineate fire susceptible areas from (1) drought indices, (2) prediction, and (3) weighted overlay analysis. In order to avoid reliance 5+ hours latency between data transfer and data processing for state-of- the-art satellites. The proposed methodology of this study is to assess data pipeline from acquisition with a focus on short-interval pre-fire assessment that will delineate potential high-risk areas hence allowing officials to focus preventive measures accordingly. The research aims to improve the short-interval pre-fire data analysis by assessing the Bobcat fire outbreaks and taking a closer look at pre-fire detection methodology. Results from weighted overlay analysis scenarios delineate areas that are classified as susceptible. On the other hand, prediction and drought indices scenarios do not yield expected results.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJohn Carlson Bowers\n\nSpatiotemporal Analysis of the SLOSH and ADCIRC Storm Surge Models: A Case Study of Hurricane Ida\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Darren Ruddell, Guoping Huang\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nKurtis Eisenhuth\n\nMapping Punk Music and its Relative Subgenres\n\nAdvisor: John Wilson | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, Elisabeth Sedano\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nGeographic information systems (GIS) contain visualization and analytical tools that assist users to better understand the spatial and temporal relationships between mapped entities. The formation of music genres, for example, is a complex phenomenon that can be explored through spatial analysis using GIS software. The genre of punk music emerged in New York City, NY in the early 1970s with the appearance of bands such as the New York Dolls and The Ramones. Punk music is unique because commercial or mainstream success is most likely not the sole motivator for musicians who propagate the genre. The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mentality of those who originally played punk music, coupled with the unique subcultures that stemmed from local groupings of popular bands raises questions as to the nature of the environment and people closest in proximity to the phenomenon. This study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal relationships between genre-specific punk bands and their local environments within the context of sociodemographics and time. A literature review was conducted to identify the temporal and spatial evolution of punk music. ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro were used to analyze, display, and prepare the spatial data, which included locations of band formation sites, venue openings, and census data from 1970. Point cluster and proximity analysis, along with historic census data quantification were employed to tell the story of punk music within the context of time and space. The people, environment, and spatial diffusion of locations (as well as attributes) associated with early punk music is characterized through the use of GIS. Findings revealed through this research exemplified the versatility of GIS and created a repeatable process for examining other music genres.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nValerie Girerd\n\nA Critical Assessment of the Green Sea Turtle Central West Pacific Distinct Population Segment Utilizing Maxent Modeling on Nesting Site Locations\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Laura Loyola\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nGlobal climate change is proceeding at an unprecedented rate, and one species that is particularly vulnerable are green sea turtles. Green sea turtles are excellent indicators of climate change impacts on coastal and marine habitats as they rely on both at different points in their life cycles. The green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) were added to the Endangered Species Act in 1978. In 2015, a status review completed on the now eleven distinct population segments (DPS) identified three DPS as endangered and the other eight as threatened. Out of these eleven populations, this paper assesses the extinction risk of the endangered Central West Pacific (CWP) DPS with Maxent habitat suitability modeling of nesting sites under current climate conditions and an extensive assessment of factors influencing population dynamics. The Maxent model used 101 green sea turtle nesting sites located within the CWP DPS and seven of the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim clipped to within a 12 kilometers shoreline buffer, because green sea turtles only nest along the shorelines. The Maxent results calculated the suitability threshold for the CWP DPS was 0.0652, which means that values below that threshold are nesting sites that are considered not suitable, and values above that threshold are nesting sites that are considered suitable. Out of all the shorelines in the CWP DPS, only 26 percent were considered suitable nesting habitat. The extinction risk analysis followed a criteria written for this thesis based on the knowledge of extinction risk status assessments of the IUCN Red List and Seminoff’s 2015 Status Review. The results of the extinction risk analysis of the CWP DPS indicate they are at a medium risk of extinction. Although this population is not indicating a high risk of extinction currently, their population abundance is still low enough to be considered endangered which warrants more effective and efficient conservation measures to be implemented.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nPhilip Hess\n\nBuilding a Spatial Database for Agricultural Record Keeping and Management on a Regenerative Farm\n\nAdvisor: An-Min Wu | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nIdentified by polycultures of plants and animals, regenerative farms are made up of complex interrelated systems and face challenges with data management and record keeping. Despite regenerative farms having more complex record keeping needs than industrial (monoculture) farms, they are not well supported by existing farm management software. A spatial database can be a powerful tool for organizing, accessing, and analyzing farm data. The objectives of this research are to design and create a functional demonstration of a spatial database for agricultural record keeping that is tailored to the needs of regenerative farmers. The initial database design was informed by an extensive literature review of record keeping technologies in agriculture as well as the author’s professional experience working on regenerative farms. The database’s logical schema was finalized after conducting interviews with farmers and leaders of the regenerative movement in Ventura County, CA. Nine interview subjects representing five regenerative agriculture organizations participated in this study. The farms had varying record keeping practices, from memory, to spreadsheets, to Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS). A spatial database was created in PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension and populated with archival farm data to demonstrate the database’s usefulness to regenerative farmers. The data was combined and visualized through SQL queries that leveraged the relational, temporal, and spatial qualities of the farm data. While this spatial database requires technical proficiency to set up and maintain, it was found to be more effective at handling a farms’ data than their current record keeping systems. Spatial databases are well equipped to handle the data needs of a regenerative farm.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJennifer Horowitz\n\nWhere Geospatial Software Development and Video Game Development Intersect: Using Content Analysis to Better Understand Disciplinary Commonalities and Facilitate Technical Exchange\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Steven Fleming\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMegan Kelly\n\nThe Impact of Severe Coastal Flooding on Economic Recovery Disparities: A Study of New Jersey Communities Following Hurricane Sandy\n\nAdvisor: Darren Ruddell | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Steven Fleming\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nRecent severe flooding caused by storms, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012, has damaged vulnerable coastal communities across the United States at an increasing occurrence and severity. Not only do floods threaten lives and property, but they also alter the shape of a community through imbalanced recovery among socially and economically vulnerable populations. This concern begs the research question: what, if any, are the differences in recovery between communities of different economic standing concerning flood inundation levels after a severe coastal flooding event? Economic recovery disparity was investigated by analyzing New Jersey's socio-economic structure before and after Hurricane Sandy according to inundation depths categorized as impact zones: None (NIZ), Minor (MIZ), Serious (SrIZ), and Severe (SvIZ). The research design was developed to (1) examine the physical exposure of Hurricane Sandy across New Jersey; (2) investigate the socio-economic characteristics of New Jersey communities before and after Hurricane Sandy; and (3) determine whether, or not, proximity to severe flooding resulted in notable changes to citizen’s economic standing. The analysis compared tabular data from 2010 and 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates using three evaluations: population, income, and housing. Results displayed variable levels of impact throughout the entire study area from 2010 to 2018 regarding population, income, and housing; however, results did not show statistically significant relationships between economic recovery and flood inundation levels.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMichael Forrest Kent Lizarraga\n\nElectric Vehicles & Charging Stations: Los Angeles County’s Road Readiness for California’s Transportation Electrification\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nTaylor Corrin Robinson\n\nPharmacy Shortage Areas Across the United States and a Visual Representation by a Web Mapping Application\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Leilei Duan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nPharmacies are one of the most used healthcare facilities across the nation due to of the number of services provided within a retail setting. The services provided by a retail pharmacy include dispensing of medications, vaccines, diagnostic testing, counseling, and more, all of which are pertinent to creating and maintaining a healthy community. A pharmacy shortage area is a location or area with an inadequate number of pharmacies available to a community leading to residents traveling far distances to their nearest pharmacy. Determining states or parts of the country that have a large number of these shortage areas provides a blueprint of where pharmacies are greatly needed. This project provides a national distribution of the accessibility of pharmacy locations by census tract for 2018 and 2020. These results are presented in a web mapping application through ArcGIS Pro. By presenting pharmacy shortage areas by census tract and over time, policymakers have highly relevant information. Given this information, there is a better chance for federal, state, and local policy changes that may improve pharmacy accessibility overall.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nDakota Alexander Slaton\n\nThe Impact of Definition Criteria on Mapped Wildland-Urban Interface: A Case Study for Ten Counties along the Oregon-California Border\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Darren Ruddell, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nLarge and severe wildfires have become the norm in many parts of the western US, including the region along the Oregon-California border. As populations in this area continue to grow, they encroach on undeveloped land with abundant wildland fuels and high fire risk. Communities that inhabit this wildland-urban interface (WUI) are increasingly imperiled as climate change exacerbates catastrophic fire activity. While previous, national-level studies have established a methodological baseline for WUI identification using vegetation and population density data, the impacts of variable criteria on small-scale study areas remains under investigated. This is a key area of concern because the adequate identification of WUI communities is a vital first step for effective public policy decision making, emergency planning, and resource allocation. This project attempts to bridge the current research gap by analyzing the impact of vegetation and population variable parameters on the size and character of identified WUI areas for ten counties along the Oregon-California border. This analysis is used to generate an optimal WUI definition for the project area, which defines the WUI as census block groups with ≥1 household/400 acres and ≥25 % wildland vegetation cover. This project finds that, compared with previous national-level studies, a much lower population density threshold is necessary to adequately identify plausible WUI communities. This study also supports previous findings, which indicate that vegetation density thresholds are of secondary importance when compared to population density. These findings are of interest to land managers who are tasked with resource allocation and wildland firefighting in the WUI, along with residents who inhabit these communities.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nCharlotte Startin\n\nAssessing Woody Plant Encroachment in Marin County, California, 1952-2018\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Andrew Marx\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nLand managers and ecologists aim to maintain the healthy balance of an ecosystem. Ecosystems are not static but are vulnerable to change and have been especially impacted by humans. Ecological restoration often involves reestablishing habitat to a previous condition or mitigating changes in ecosystem functioning. Stewards of the land must understand an area’s historical ecological context to inform restoration decisions. In Marin County, the study area for this thesis, woody plant encroachment caused by fire suppression is an ecological concern. Where indigenous people once managed the land with frequent burning, fire suppression throughout the past two centuries has caused ecological changes. Transitions from grassland to shrubland and from shrubland to woodland are a result of woody plant encroachment and can lead to decreased biodiversity. This thesis classified and compared historical and modern aerial imagery to assess changing vegetation communities in Marin County. Land cover change was calculated and visualized from 1952 to today. Ultimately, it was found that herbaceous plant communities and shrubland have shrunk by 62% and 51%, respectively, while woodland has increased by 307%. The mosaiced landscape of 1952 is now more homogenous. 44% of total woody plant encroachment consisted of woodland replacing shrubland, while 39% consisted of woodland replacing grassland, and 17% consisted of shrubland replacing grassland. More shrubland was lost than gained, and the most common shrub species replacing grassland was coyote brush. The most common woodland species replacing grassland and shrubland was Douglas fir. These results point to specific targeting of coyote brush and Douglas fir establishment in areas of known encroachment. While this study provides valuable data on type conversion over the past 70 years, future research should focus particularly on vegetation changes in the last decade to support proactive approaches to managing encroachment.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAnahi Tostado\n\nIdentifying Long-Runout Landslides On the Surface Of Mars\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Swift | Committee Members: Steven Fleming, Jennifer Bernstein\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nGeologists have studied Earth’s long-runout landslides for many decades due to their unpredictability and massiveness. Long-runout landslides on Earth largely depend on initial mass position, friction, slope, topographic relief, gravity, and sediment composition. Landslides on Mars exhibit a high degree of preservation, offering insights into the planet’s history, including the occurrence of water in past eras. This study examined long-runout landslides in the Valles Marineris canyon system of Mars and compared them to similar landslides on Earth. The methodology developed in this study utilized GIS tools and High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) imagery to visually interpret and measure the mass movement of long-runout landslides of affected terrain. Landslide visualizations and cross-sections were manually created to facilitate estimating changes in the length and height of the Mars long-runout landslides. These measurements were used to calculate Heim’s ratio, an approximation of the friction coefficient of Mars surface regolith comprising the landslide masses, and to compare these values to those of similar long-runout landslides on Earth. The goal was to test the assumption that friction, specifically, plays a significant role in long-runout landslides on Mars. In the future, an improved understanding of long-runout landslides on Mars may assist scientific communities in interpreting Mars’s geological processes and climatology and illustrate important knowledge gaps in Mars history.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nNatalie Treadwell\n\nSatellite Derived Bathymetry in the Canadian Archipelago Using Multi-spectral and LiDAR Space-based Remote Sensing\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Andrew Marx, Rodrigo Garcia\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nJust over 14% of the Canadian Arctic Ocean has been surveyed using multi-beam sonar mapping techniques, and comprehensive charting of navigable shallow water is even more scarce. With the use of LiDAR satellites and multispectral sensors, optically shallow water that is free of sea ice can be modeled remotely through a process called Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB). Using two empirical algorithms, the multiband value algorithm (MBVA) and the two-band value algorithm (TBVA), bottom depth in the Bellot Strait is interpolated. The study area is between 71˚ and 73˚ of latitude where North America meets the Somerset Island. Shallow water depth can be interpolated using LiDAR data which is collected by the ICESat-2 satellite, equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System that records ellipsoidal heights with uncertainties up to 0.70 m. The multispectral data is provided by the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager constellation at 30 m resolution. The MBVA and TBVA use refraction corrected LiDAR depths within raster cells which overlap LiDAR returns to create a training dataset to inform interpolation of the SDB depth. SDB offers the ability to chart remote shallow places that would be difficult and expensive to reach otherwise. With the introduction of the Seabed 2030 project by the International Hydrography Organization and the United Nations this past year, LiDAR refraction correction and SDB modeling has the potential to accelerate charting of coastlines, contributing towards our global pursuit to create stronger models of the Ocean seafloor and improve maritime safety. This thesis assesses the challenges of conducting SDB analysis in the Arctic region, using the Bellot Strait as a study area. Where appropriate remote sensing data exists, this process can be repeated.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nChelsea Valenzuela\n\nA Spatiotemporal Analysis of Racial Disparity in the Distribution of Superfund Sites within Santa Clara County, California\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nSites listed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List (NPL) are some of the most polluted or contaminated locations in the United States. Only locations that have been evaluated as posing the greatest widespread and imminent threat to human health and/or the biophysical environment make it onto the NPL, and Santa Clara County (SCC) in California is home to twenty-three of them. Since the creation of the NPL and associated Superfund programin the 1980s, hundreds of studies in the field of environmental justice have provided evidencethat the burdens of environmental hazards, like Superfund sites, are not distributed equally across racial, ethnic, or economic groups. Thus, in an effort to better understand the extent of this idea this project seeks to ascertain if a spatial disparity in the distribution of Superfund site locations within SCC exists today and whether post-siting demographic change occurred around sites within the county. This project maps the locations of active and historic Superfund sites in addition to completing a longitudinal, area-weighted analysis of the surrounding communities and study area. By spatiotemporally assessing theories associated with hazardous waste sites and disparities, this project ultimately seeks to provide a clearer understanding of how environmental hazards and disparities can affect and shape the communities in which they are found.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nBeth Wellman\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Marketing: A Transdisciplinary Approach to Curriculum Development\n\nAdvisor: John Wilson | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Darrell Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nResearchers in the field of Spatial Sciences often use Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Marketing, a sub-field of business, has increasingly used GIS to address and solve marketing problems. The Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California (USC) has only recently recognized the importance of teaching GIS to better prepare their students for the workforce. The school sought to rectify the situation through a marketing course focused on the analysis, interpretation, and application of spatial data. However, when a transdisciplinary course is created, the disciplinary constructs must be informed by disciplinary experts and the design grounded in educational research. This thesis examined disciplinary thinking in Spatial Sciences and Marketing to inform the development of a graduate elective course “GIS and Decision Making in Marketing.” Interviews were conducted with USC professors in both fields on the nature of disciplinary thinking, approaches to research and analysis, and commonalities between fields. These interviews were analyzed using content analysis. In general, marketing is an evolving discipline that currently defines disciplinary thinking as gathering and analyzing data, applying frameworks, evaluating constraints and assumptions, and drawing actionable conclusions. Spatial sciences sees disciplinary thinking as knowing theories, using improved computational tools, and engaging in spatial thinking, reasoning, and communicating. These findings were incorporated into the development of a transdisciplinary curriculum for the elective, which fostered students creating knowledge. While it is too early for formal assessment, informal assessment of the unit suggests that it improved students’ ability to reason spatially within the marketing context. This project can inform other business schools seeking to integrate GIS into their curriculum, or other fields seeking to engage in transdisciplinary approaches to education.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJerome Wu\n\nAssessing Homeless Accessibility to Community Resources in the City of Los Angeles\n\nAdvisor: Leilei Duan | Committee Members: Robert Vos, John Wilson\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nEfforts to address the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles have made little progress in the last few years. As homelessness has increased, government officials have struggled to find solutions that will benefit both the homeless community and mainstream residents of Los Angeles. Furthermore, the city may not have enough resources and space to support the growing homeless population. Thus, this research examined the spatial correlation between the availability of resources and the homeless community. It also addressed the current accessibility of community resources and investigated whether Los Angeles is equipped to meet the needs of the growing homeless community. This research employed a service area analysis in ArcGIS Pro to determine the walking distance of food, hygiene, shelter, and transportation services via walking and identified key neighborhoods with large homeless population that are lacking in certain types of community resources. The results have shown that all four service types are available in neighborhoods with a large homeless population, such as Downtown and Historic South Central. However, food and hygiene services are lacking in some neighborhoods with a smaller but significant homeless population, more specifically, in the northern regions of Los Angeles. Shelter and transportation services are adequately available throughout Los Angeles. The limitations of this research were discussed in the last chapter of this thesis.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nErwin Abidog\n\nSilicon Valley Construction Project Web Mapping Application\n\nAdvisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, Jennifer Swift\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMelina Bennett\n\nUsing the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to Analyze Changes in Shoreline Position Caused by Seawalls Along a Section of Oregon’s Coast\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: John Wilson, Andrew Marx\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe Lincoln Littoral Cell (LLC) contains a 24 km stretch of coastline along Oregon’s central coast. Nearly 50% of the LLC’s coastline has been armored with shoreline protection structures (SPSs), mainly riprap and seawalls. SPSs are constructed to reduce damage to coastal developments caused by breaking waves, flooding, and sediment erosion. Although the SPSs are meant to protect the coast from erosion, they can ultimately cause erosion adjacent to the structure or further down shore. Future projections and models show an increase in frequency of large storm systems that generate larger than average waves and water levels, resulting in increased erosion and flooding. This project utilizes the USGS’s ArcGIS add-on, Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), to analyze digitized shoreline positions from 1997 to 2016. Visual analysis shows that while on average the shoreline is accreting at a rate of 0.32 m/yr, there is localized erosion adjacent to 53% of the SPSs. Future policies regarding the placement and build of SPSs should take into consideration the long-term negative effects of these structures.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJordan Cooper\n\nSurface Rupture Detection with Support Vector Machine Classification: Case Study from Ridgecrest, CA\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Yao-Yi Chiang, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nSara Evanoff\n\nUtilizing existing museum collections and GIS for paleontological site assessment and management\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nRegulation of paleontological resources began with the creation of the Antiquities Act of 1906, but it was not until the passing of the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act (PRPA) of 2009 that the regulation was clarified on the following: permitting, penalties, inventorying, amateur collecting, curation, and education and research in certain departments within the Department of Interior (DOI) and the Department of Agriculture. This served to further protect paleontological resources within public lands through the use of scientific expertise for the purpose of education and research. ❧ Museum collections are held within public trust for the purpose of education and research and are curated to the highest scientific standards. These institutions work with federal institutions to preserve paleontological specimens found on public lands in accordance with the PRPA. Accessing collections protected by the PRPA requires written permission and location data is exempt from being revealed. Digitization of paleontological collections that are not protected by the PRPA has been a slow process. ❧ Online collaborative databases such as Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio) and the Global Biodiversity Facility (GBIF) offer museums the chance to combine with other museums and institutions to develop a global database that shares highly curated biological and paleontological collections for the purpose of education and research. This evolution of museum collections can benefit spatial research as biodiversity data standards become more developed. However, this evolution has also been slow, and research incorporating paleontological collections with GIS is limited. ❧ The objective of this thesis is to present a case study focusing on Petroleum County, Montana, where a dual geodatabase system was created incorporating both museum and field collections to assist with site management, assessment, and inventorying. A customized model toolbox allows for paleontologists to perform analyses related to their hypotheses. These geodatabases are designed for the sole purpose of simplifying and aiding in management practices through the incorporation of museum collections. Museum collections are already incorporated with these assessments and inventorying. With the addition of GIS, museum collections’ involvement will bring new possibilities for how their collections are applied.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nDaniel Fisher\n\nGIS Analysis of Helicopter Rescue in San Bernardino County, California\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Elisabeth Sedano, Steven Fleming\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nLucresia Graham\n\nA Cartographic Exploration of Census Data on Select Housing Challenges Among California Residents\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Swift | Committee Members: John Wilson, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nShort of becoming homeless, everyone must live somewhere, but the circumstances leading to an individual’s choice of housing can be complex. Housing choices represent both personal factors and outside influences and are often wrapped up in the overly simplified concept of “housing affordability.” In California, the unaffordability of housing is particularly acute. This thesis uniquely combined multiple datasets from the US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development to classify areas of the state according to the number of select housing-related challenges that residents experienced as a result of their housing accommodations. The challenges were then mapped, individually and collectively, to observe the geographic distribution of the phenomena. This innovative method supplements the 30-percent ratio (of housing costs to income) methodology traditionally used to denote housing affordability and adds a visual and spatial display of housing challenges at a statewide level and in several focus areas that have been negatively impacted by the current housing crisis. Finally, a review is provided of existing and potential solutions to the four housing challenges investigated. The results may be of interest to affordable housing providers, legislators, and even residents.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nKatrina Gressett\n\nClassifying Ash Cloud Attributes of Eyjafjallajkull Volcano, Iceland, using Satellite Remote Sensing\n\n2nd prize\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Andrew Marx, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nTracking volcanic ash clouds is integral to ensuring the safety of people traveling by air and living on the ground. The explosive eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano, Iceland, that began on April 14, 2010, produced a column of steam and ash carried by the jet stream to Europe. In London, the volcanic Ash Advisory Center provided the ash cloud's overall spatial extent across Europe but was unable to provide localized forecasts or details such as cloud density. This eruption forced the most prolonged suspension of air travel in Europe since the second world war with significant cost to airlines and travelers. ❧ High temporal, multispectral thermal satellite imagery from the MODIS instrument provides a platform for tracking eruptive materials. This study uses the brightness temperature difference between MODIS thermal bands to track the ash cloud for each day of the eruption. Unsupervised classification is used to determine the spatial extent of the ash cloud. Measurements from the ground-based EARLINET Lidar network are used to compare the results derived from MODIS imagery. Interpolations based on the EARLINET Lidar data are comparable to the MODIS classification but may not be economical for developing regions.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nPhilip Griffin\n\nAutomated Assessment of Potential Cell Tower Signal\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Swift | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Robert Vos Kenan Li\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nNatalie Hayashibara\n\nHappy Traveler: Discovering Joy on University Campuses and Beyond Through a Web-Based GIS Application\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Elisabeth Sedano, Jennifer Swift\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nKatrina Kaiser\n\nEnriching the Demographic Survey Sampling for the Los Angeles County Annual Homeless Count with Spatial Statistics\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Elisabeth Sedano, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAriana Kim\n\nEstimating the number of people at-risk for lead exposure from lead service lines and examining correlations with socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nAdvisor: Leilei Duan | Committee Members: Robert Vos, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe dangers of lead poisoning have posed a real threat to the population of the United States since the turn of the century. It has a cumulative effect in the human body and can therefore build up over time, even with low dose exposure. Children are especially susceptible to lead exposure due to their increased absorption rate of the metal and the lasting health issues that can persist throughout their lives. Minority communities with low socioeconomic status are especially vulnerable to exposure because they are more likely to live in close proximity to lead pollution sources, older homes, and have lower rates of toxicity screenings. Poisoning occurs primarily when lead is ingested through lead-based paint, lead contaminated water pipes, dust, and soil. Older cities across the United States are particularly prone to have populations with increased blood lead levels because lead was a common building material in the early 1900s. Milwaukee, Wisconsin is one such historical city where around 40% of the city’s active residential water service lines are constructed of lead. This study quantifies how many people are at risk for lead poisoning based on the existence of lead service lines in their buildings by census tract. Given the deeply segregated history of Milwaukee, an issue that still plagues the city to this day, this study also examines the relationship between the number of at-risk people per census tract and a variety of socioeconomic indicators. Dasymetric mapping techniques as well as regression analysis were used to shed light on this environmental justice issue in Milwaukee. Results show that the number of at-risk people in a census tract has a positive linear relationship with the race, education level, and poverty status of neighborhoods. In the context of Milwaukee’s demographics, the issue of lead exposure due to LSL disproportionately affects poorer communities of color.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMaria Leasure\n\nGeodatabase for Archaeogenetics: Ancient Peoples and Family Lines\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Yao-Yi Chiang, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nPetros Maskal\n\nScenario-Based Site Suitability Analysis and Framework for Biodiversity Conservation: Agricultural Zone, Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador\n\nAdvisor: Darren Ruddell | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Leilei Duan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAndre McClure\n\nSuitable California Opportunity Zone (COZ) Locations for Affordable Housing Development in the Cities of Bakersfield, Los Angeles, and Palmdale\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: John P. Wilson, Leilei Duan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nCalifornia Opportunity Zones (COZs) provide tax incentives to investors and developers who are interested to build housing units containing affordable housing (AH). The population in California continues to increase while the cost of housing has increased significantly due to high demand. Low-income populations lack access to AH and this contributes to the financial burdens of residents who are working but cannot afford where they live. The cost of homes and rent is rising faster than the wages earned by those who work full time at minimum wage. This thesis analyzes demographic data from the U.S. Census and other sources using geospatial and statistical methods to propose new COZs in the cities of Bakersfield, Los Angeles, and Palmdale. The ideal locations for newly designated COZs would have lower population densities than much of the city of Los Angeles and labor opportunities that do not require higher education or training and that can be accessed via public transportation. The geographic placement of AH is critical to the potential positive impact on low income communities. A weighted overlay model was used to determine site suitability within each city based on features related to desirable characteristics. The new zones will provide economic opportunities for residents, alleviate problems related to population density and overcrowding, and improve the quality of life for not only low income populations but also the cities as a whole.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJohn McDermott\n\nGeographic Object Based Image Analysis for Utility Scale Photovoltaic Site Suitability Studies\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: An-Min Wu, Andrew Marx\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nBryna Mills\n\nAn Exploration of the Spatiotemporal Distribution of Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in the Eastern Bering Sea: 1982 - 2018\n\n1st prize\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Elisabeth Sedano\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nSnow crab, Chionoecetes opilio, is the largest commercial crab fishery in Alaska. Populations in the eastern Bering Sea have fluctuated over space and time, challenging statisticians attempting to model their distribution and predict stock trends to support sustainable management decisions. Climate change contributes to model uncertainty due to increased environmental variance and subsequent shifts in species assemblages adapting to changing conditions in the region. This research applied statistical toolkits and visualization techniques in GIS for spatiotemporal analysis of snow crab distribution in the eastern Bering Sea over thirty-seven years (1982 – 2018). The National Marine Fisheries Service standardized bottom trawl survey provided a robust dataset to statistically explore spatial and temporal patterns and relationships between snow crab abundance in terms of catch per unit of effort to sea temperatures, depth, and Pacific cod abundance. The temporal correlation in abundance patterns between snow crab year classes or cohorts was tested using exploratory regression and geographically weighted regression was used to visualize the nature and scale of relationships within the survey region. Overall spatial patterns of snow crab distribution in the eastern Bering Sea reflected large scale warming trends and contraction of the population to the north towards the Bering Strait. No significant relationship was found between snow crab and Pacific cod distributions on a global scale but there was evidence of a local scale inverse relationship in the southern survey region. In absence of favorable bottom temperatures in 2018, snow crab distribution displayed a greater depth dependence in the northernmost region. Temporal correlation was detected between age classes of snow crab, suggesting connectivity between maternal cohorts and progeny. These results identify local and global scale distribution trends which will support better predictive models for fisheries.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nRobert Smith\n\nEvaluating Machine Learning Tools for Humanitarian Road Network Mapping\n\nAdvisor: Orhun Aydin | Committee Members: Yao-Yi Chiang, Steven Fleming\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJohn Smith\n\nMulti-Criteria Site Selection for Innovative Wind Turbine in an Urban Environment\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Su Jin Lee\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nDue to technological advances, wind energy is now a commercially viable input to the electrical grid. However, siting constraints of wind resource availability, regional economics, community concerns, issues with grid integration and ecological concerns are hampering wind technology’s market penetration. This thesis seeks to address these issues by using multi-criteria site selection to demonstrate how a volumetric wind turbine can be used for successful siting of utility scaled wind turbines in urban environments. The urban environment for this study, Fort Worth, Texas, is composed of land use types and zoning restrictions some of which impose exclusion criteria that restrict most of the area of interest from the analysis. Fortunately, there are areas zoned for industrial, agricultural, and other land uses that are compatible for the siting of wind turbines. Furthermore, this research used the spatial inputs of property values, terrain, nearness to electrical infrastructure and wind resource availability to create a weight schema that can identify the best sites in the study area. The results show that a utility-scaled wind turbine could be sited within the city having a wind power ranking of marginal or greater and that has undeveloped open spaces, industrial zones, and areas such as landfills and brownfields that impose limitations to future development.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nDevin Thomas\n\nDesigning an Early Warning System Web Mapping Application for the Atlanta-Metropolitan Area before a Flooding Event\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: John Wilson, Elisabeth Sedano\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nHurricanes and heavy rainfall continue to cause flooding events. There is a need for researchers and other organizations to develop web and mobile applications to assist with flooding by studying vulnerabilities, traffic congestion, and decision making to evacuate or shelter in place. The Atlanta Metropolitan Area has not experienced a flooding event in nearly 10 years. Still, if a flood occurred, it could be as catastrophic as Hurricane Harvey was in Houston or Hurricane Katrina was in New Orleans. ❧ The Atlanta Metropolitan Area experienced a flooding event in 2009 that caused the displacement of almost 17,000 residents and resulted in the death of 10 people. This event motivated the development of a web application that could help users prepare before a flooding event. The application enables preparedness by allowing users to view the built and social environments in areas affected by previous floods on their mobile device or PC. By allowing the mobile device or PC to access their location, the user can view nearby shelters should evacuation become necessary. This application has the potential to bridge the communication gap between federal, state, and local officials, emergency responders, and the public before a flooding event. ❧ This application has the potential to reduce loss of life and help with planning responses to future flooding events by identifying nearby shelters, and eventually helping individuals to develop ways to protect their homes and businesses from flooding.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nCirenia Torres\n\nAssessing the Connectivity for the jaguar (Panthera onca) in the United States-Mexico Border Ecoregions Using Species Distribution Modeling and Factorial Least Cost Path Analysis\n\nAdvisor: John Wilson | Committee Members: Steven Fleming, Samuel Cushman\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nConnectivity is important for biodiversity conservation because it can offset the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation, allowing migration, dispersal, and adequate gene flow. Barriers that cut across a species range such as the United States-Mexico border wall can block dispersal and negatively impact gene flow between populations. It is therefore important to understand how to establish or re-establish wildlife corridors in order to help species survive. The focal species selected for this thesis project was the jaguar (Panthera onca). The study area comprised several ecoregions that covered portions of the United States of America (US) and Mexico. The jaguar’s suitable habitat was identified using a Random Forest model to predict potential habitats. The factorial least-cost path analysis was used to identify the jaguar’s potential corridors. Results predict there is good habitat for jaguars in the Sonoran-Sinaloan subtropical dry forest, Sinaloan dry forests, Sierra Madre Occidental, California montane chaparral and woodlands, Arizona Mountains forest, Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests, Veracruz moist forests, Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests, Sierra de la Laguna dry forests, Tamaulipan matorral, and small portions of the Sonoran desert ecoregion. The jaguar's potential corridor modeling suggests that there were previously two high-density corridors between the US and Mexico allowing jaguar connectivity. However, if the partially constructed border barriers are completed those jaguar corridors will be lost. Work on nine co-distributed mammals (orders: Carnivora and Artiodactyla): jaguar (Panthera onca), mountain lion (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), bobcat (Lynx rufus), black bear (Ursus americanus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis), and Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in the US-Mexico border ecoregions will continue after the completion of this work.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nDrew Vagen\n\nSite Suitability Analysis for Implementing Tidal Energy Technology in Southern California\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein and John P. Wilson (Co-advisor) | Committee Members: John P. Wilson, Leilei Duan Elisabeth Sedano\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nTraditional sources of energy are outdated and destructive. There is a clear need for new and more sustainable energy sources, creating a huge market for innovative research and technology within the energy industry. The use of the world’s oceans to generate energy is pioneering and provides many enticing benefits including cleaner and more consistent energy generation. Tidal energy converters harness the power of moving water generated by the tides and is a huge source of untapped energy. This study analyzed the parameters most important to successful tidal energy generation in order to determine the most suitable sites for implementing this technology in southern California. Using data from various sources, two different interpolation methods were used to create a continuous raster surface of tidal range values that, along with other variable fields related to tidal energy, were used to perform two different types of analysis, a weighted overlay and fuzzy overlay analysis. The results of these two different analysis methods were compared and this methodology provided a conclusive map showing the most effective sites for successful use of tidal energy converters in southern California. An analysis was also completed to look at the distance of suitable sites to nearby onshore energy facilities. This research builds upon previous renewable energy studies in southern California and provides insight into how the region can reduce its fossil fuel emissions and convert to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMegan White\n\nCal ToxTrack: A Web GIS for Pollution Mapping in California\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Jill Sohm\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nPast chemical emergencies in the United States prompted the initiation of a variety of toxic substance and pollution control programs and regulations, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Clean Air Act. While these have produced decades-worth of valuable pollution datasets, they are stored on a government website in a collection of CSV tables. This method of accessibility is largely incompatible for analysis due to the static nature of tablesㅡthe need to download them locally and appropriately query them to extract relevant data. For analysis, data is best visualized with dynamic tools and within interactive environments. ❧ This project focused on the public’s right-to-know about toxic chemical releases in their community by developing a geospatial web application called Cal ToxTrack. Built from scratch using PostgreSQL as a database, GeoDjango as a Python development framework, and Leaflet as a JavaScript framework, it effectively visualizes chemical releases and provides interactive tools to help explore pollution data. To ensure that the application does not depend on access via state and federal governments or whether the developer has continued access to commercial products, this application developed entirely from the backend database through the front end and interface, otherwise known as full stack development, relies on publicly-available pollution datasets downloaded and hosted by an API created by the developer and was entirely created using open source tools. With Cal ToxTrack, users can utilize a map and spatiotemporal tools to visualize what chemicals have been released, to what magnitude, and where; practicing their right-to-know.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nJorge Amar\n\nUsing aerial imagery to assess tropical forest cover surrounding restoration sites in Costa Rica\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Andrew Marx, Laura Loyola\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nTropical landscapes in Costa Rica have increasingly become targets of restoration efforts after deforestation depleted 90% of the region’s forests by the end of the 20th century. Research has shown that the environment surrounding a restoration site influences outcomes in fragmented landscapes, particularly as to the amount of forest cover surrounding restoration areas. However, the degree of influence that forest cover has on restoration sites and the long-term effects have historically been understudied due to the difficulty in assessing forest cover in remote regions through conventional field methods. As a result, there is a need for more time and cost-effective ways of evaluating and understanding forest cover change within the context of restoration efforts in remote areas. ❧ Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies have been utilized by researchers to understand better the relationships between abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems. This study analyzed forest cover changes from 2005 to 2014 using high-resolution remote imagery to understand how forest cover changed surrounding 13 restoration sites near Las Cruces Biological Station (LCBS). The forest cover analysis revealed that the study region experienced a 9% net increase in forest cover over nine years. Similarly, all except one of the restoration sites had a net increase in forest cover within 200 meters. Topographic variables were extracted from a 5-meter DEM to understand their influence on the changes in forest cover. We hypothesized that elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to restoration site would have a strong and positive correlation with whether areas surrounding the restoration sites reforested from 2005 to 2014. A regression analysis revealed that topographic factors do not solely explain the variations in forest cover gain between sites; However, aspect, elevation, and distance to the restoration sites center had a significant impact on forest cover gain in the study sites.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nErin Barr\n\nAn Accessibility Analysis of the Homeless Populations' Potential Access to Healthcare Facilities in the Los Angeles Continuum of Care\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Robert Vos, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nLos Angeles has a homelessness crisis. The city has long struggled to meet the needs of the growing homeless population, and the problem continues to amplify as the most recent 2019 Point-In-Time (PIT) Count shows an increase in homelessness. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) federal grant program establishes regional or local planning bodies to coordinate housing and services funding for homeless people in an effort to promote an integrated system of care. As a local planning body, CoCs address the issues their local communities and have the potential to affect positive change. Access to healthcare is one such issue facing homeless populations that the LA CoC could better address using spatial analysis, namely where homeless populations reside in the CoC boundaries relative to established hospitals and medical facilities. ❧ This project used a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the state of homelessness in the Los Angeles CoC as of June 2019. A population distribution and density analysis was conducted, indicating that homeless populations tended to be larger and more concentrated in the census tracts comprising downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. To determine the degree to which homeless individuals can access hospitals and medical facilities, an accessibility analysis was conducted using a modified two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) methodology. The 2SFCA accessibility index indicated that census tracts within the downtown area had homeless populations within a 1-mile distance of at least one hospital as opposed to more rural tracts that tended to lack any access. However, access to medical facilities within a walkable distance varied in the downtown census tracts. Recommendations for funding allocation, the establishment of transportation initiatives, and additional medical facilities to improve access were made.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nEmily Bartee\n\nRoadway Hazard Analysis: A Safe Ride for Motorcycles\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Leilei Duan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nMotorcycles are disproportionately affected in collisions when compared to other motor vehicle types, leading to an increased vulnerability of injury or death to motorcyclists. Multiple factors can contribute to this disproportionate impact, including environmental factors, inattention of other motorists, driver error, and physical road characteristics. Many motorcycle safety initiatives address the error and role of other drivers in motorcycle-involved collisions but little attention is often given to the environmental and roadway factors. This lack of attention and analysis reduces the ability of transportation agencies to obtain a complete common operating picture for all factors impacting motorcycle safety – allowing for missed opportunities to decrease the increased vulnerability of motorcyclists. ❧ This project utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool to identify locations on state-maintained roadways showing statistically significant clusters of motorcycle involved collisions. The collision data for this report were retrieved from the Kentucky State Police collision database; filters were used to extract motorcycle involved collisions for a ten-year period from 2009 and 2018. A site suitability study was completed using the collision data and road network layers to determine sites suitable to the introduction of a motorcycle lane in an effort to increase motorcycle safety. While there are multiple strategies for reducing motorcycle involved collisions, exclusive motorcycle lanes offer motorcyclists a safe location to ride without interference from other motor vehicles in areas with high traffic flow. Spatial analysis was utilized to complete a site suitability study to determine needed and viable locations for motorcycle lanes using Livingston, Jefferson, Fayette, and Meade County within the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a study area.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nSantina Benincasa\n\nA spatial investigation of New York City's historical shoreline\n\nAdvisor: Andrew Marx | Committee Members: John P. Wilson, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nWhile the New York City coastline protects its citizens from severe weather, it has been dramatically altered due to human and natural processes over the past century. To analyze these changes over time, two locations that have faced significant coastal erosion over the course of this century were studied: Jamaica Bay and Coney Island/Gravesend Bay of South Brooklyn. This thesis project investigates shoreline changes to these two locations using historical and current maps, to quantify how the shoreline moved from the early 1900s to now. Utilizing storm and shoreline measurement data with geographic information systems (GIS), shoreline changes were measured and compared using reference points. Additionally, records of storm severity in these areas during the same timeframe were analyzed alongside the shoreline movement data. Results from these two sites indicate that accretion has been the prime mode of coastal change throughout this century. These results are contradictory to anecdotal evidence that shorelines have significantly eroded with storm activity. During this 120-year study period, the shorelines have experienced some erosion, but overall, the shorelines have expanded. This study demonstrates, that while erosion has occurred, coastal movement is dynamic and primarily the result of human impact as opposed to natural processes.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nRyan Cameron\n\nMapping Future Population Impacts caused by Sea Level Rise in Southern California: Comparing the Cadastral-based Dasymetric System to Past Dasymetric Mapping Methods\n\nAdvisor: Katsuhiko Oda | Committee Members: Robert Vos, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nDue to the intense pollution and warming rates, as well as other strenuous factors, future sea level rise (SLR) is projected to cause severe damage to people that live in coastal areas around the world. The population from Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, California has a high chance of suffering from the imminent impact of SLR. These two cities are particularly appropriate to a study of SLR impacts because they have low-and high-laying lands. Highly developed coast line infrastructure with high property values, and large numbers of people living near the beach. ❧ This study estimates population that may be directly affected by SLR in the two cities by using three dasymetric mapping methods and two SLR projections. The methods are centroid-containment, Filtered Areal Weighting (FAW), and the Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS). The SLR projections are based on a global and local scale from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s SLR Viewer. Geographical information systems (GIS) is utilized to digitize, analyze, and compare the most recent spatial data. The project’s first objective evaluates SLR effects on populations and neighborhoods in the two cities. Secondly, this project describes and compares results between the three dasymetric mapping methods. Lastly, the mapping results of Huntington Beach are compared to its neighboring and contrasting city, Newport Beach, for further understanding of the mapping results. This study concludes that SLR may impact the wealthy population the most in both cities. Furthermore, this research provides a method for the two cities and other coastal cities in order for them to help people that may be impacted by SLR quickly and more efficiently. Emergency response agencies can also use this research to accurately portray impacts to people caused by pollution, or natural disasters.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nAmanda Cuesta\n\nFilling in the Gaps: 3D Mapping Arizona’s Basin and Range Aquifer in the Prescott Active Management\n\nAdvisor: Andrew Marx | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Leilei Duan\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nDespite Arizona relying on Arizona groundwater to meet a significant portion of its water needs, the locations of Arizona’s groundwater aquifers are not fully mapped, and methods to interpolate the locations of aquifers from test boreholes remain inaccurate. In response, this study implements a workflow leveraging three-dimensional (3D) interpolation to fill in that knowledge gap within a study site: the Prescott Active Management Area surrounding Prescott, Arizona. Using borehole log data and digital elevation models, the 3D extent of permeable layers are mapped, serving as proxies for aquifers and aquitards, respectively. This project makes use of Empirical Bayesian Kriging 3D (EBK3D) to interpolate permeability data in three dimensions. When tested on four random boreholes, this model correctly predicted an aquifer 80% of the time in comparison to 42% using traditional 2D interpolation. The model’s improved accuracy provides an approach to improve drillers’, policymakers’, and scientists’ understanding of the hydrologic activity in the area. Such an improvement may lead to better-informed storage models, changes in water management, and greater cost efficiency when drilling new wells.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nWilliam Farhat\n\nCreating a Web GIS to Support Field Operations and Enhance Data Collection for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Steve Fleming, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nInvasive insects are damaging to the environment and economy. Early detection of these pests is important to prevent their establishment before their populations grow and cause extensive damage. In the United States, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) safeguards natural resources and agriculture through their Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) program by preventing the establishment and entry of forest pests into the United States. APHIS traps exotic wood-boring beetles (EWBB) and other pests. Throughout all the APHIS offices across the United States, there is no unified field data collection method. As of 2019, the APHIS office in Chicago, IL uses Microsoft Access for all their field data collection. The main objective of this thesis is to build a Web GIS with mobile data collection capabilities and an operations dashboard to further monitor data collection in the field. Collector for ArcGIS can be used for mobile data collection in the field and an operations dashboard can help supervisors monitor field operations more effectively. This project utilized a user needs interview with members of the APHIS team in Chicago to guide application development. The developed Web GIS application, which includes an operations dasboard and Collector for ArcGIS, was then tested by users of APHIS to determine whether their workflows would benefit. The application was well received by users and the feedback helped to uncover a few notions that could guide further development of this application in the future. These enhance APHIS’s current workflow through real-time data collection as well as more accurate data collection. The completed application could also be used in rural areas where less high-risk importers are present through customization. Approximately 80% of the application would remain the same, though there would be changes in the symbology and data collection layers. This could benefit APHIS offices, as well as other organizations monitoring invasive pest control.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nTia Flippin\n\nClassifying the Alpines: Developing a Methodology to Track Environmental Changes in the Alpines Utilizing Remote Sensing and Ecozone Vegetation Patterns\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Jennifer Swift, Andrew Marx\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nVegetation growth patterns are indicators of environmental change. However, sampling and recording landscape-scale studies over time are challenging using traditional methods. This study used remotely collected imagery of montane forests through alpine over thirty years, 1984 to 2018, to classify and examine changes in vegetation patterns. The imagery analysis methodology focused on the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. Imagery from Landsat satellites was utilized to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values examining vegetation patterns throughout an elevation gradient. Elevations from 3000 meters above sea level to the peak of the tallest mountain in the study area (Uncompahgre Peak 4365 meters) then classified into the land cover types of the local ecozones. Ecozones examined were the nival and subnival of the alpine and the montane forest of the subalpine. The corresponding land cover types where soil and rock, shrubs and grass, and mixed forest, deciduous forest and coniferous forest respectfully as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey. When sampling of changes focused on single peaks, a slight rise in altitude over time is observed (m= 0.1754). When sampling included more broad sampling throughout the study area, an even more minor negative trend resulted (m= -0.1369). The study discusses that the broad standard array sampling type was possibly skewed due to samples being taken from across long distances with little elevation change overall throughout. The discussion includes suggestions for further research.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nDeclan Forberg\n\nExploring global natural disaster and climate migration data: a Web GIS application\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Darren Ruddell, Robert Vos\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nNatural disasters have always influenced migration, whether international or within one country’s borders. However, as the effects of climate change continue to cause irregular weather patterns and stronger, more frequent natural disasters, the number of individuals at risk of being displaced from their home due to natural disasters is poised to substantially increase. Given the millions of people on the brink of needing to relocate due to natural disasters, as well as the potential billions of dollars needed to repair the resulting damages, there exists a need to better understand trends in weather and migration patterns. Such an understanding would allow for governments and emergency response teams to be more prepared to face sudden onset disasters. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) published a dataset detailing the number of internally displaced people (IDP) per country per year between 2008-2018, and the specific natural disaster event associated with each IDP. This project utilized the IDMC dataset to create a web map application using ArcGIS Online that will organizes and visualizes the data in a spatial context. The original IDMC dataset was broken down into smaller thematic datasets using the R programming language, which were subsequently visualized using the ESRI products ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. The application was designed for ease of use, thus allowing for new trends and potential patterns to be discovered far more easily. The resulting web application includes widgets and tools that allow users to manipulate the dataset in meaningful ways unique to their needs.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nKelly Gulledge\n\nAn Analysis of Racial Disparity in the Distribution of Alcohol Licenses and Retailers in Orange County, California\n\nAdvisor: Darren Ruddell | Committee Members: Robert Vos, An-Min Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nSystemic racism, institutional racism, structural racism: these are the terms used to describe unequal minority participation in job markets, over representation in the criminal justice system, and lack of access to and enjoyment of clean and safe neighborhoods. Studies in social justice and environmental justice are now starting to quantify structural racism by utilizing Geographic Information Systems and applying analytic methods of Geographic Information Science. One area ripe for study of structural racism is whether race-neutral laws and regulations promote race-neutral distributions in the built environment or perpetuate existing structural racism. ❧ The distribution of alcohol retailers in Orange County, California, provided an opportunity to explore how a race neutral regulation—in operation for over two decades—has impacted the built environment. Exploring the distribution of alcohol retailers informs our understanding of structural racism because a higher density of retailers has been correlated with negative impacts on neighborhoods such as increased crime, negative health outcomes, and poverty. Moreover, California’s alcohol licensing regulations are race-neutral and as such do not consider race as a factor in determining the approval or rejection of a license application. ❧ This study analyzed the February 18, 2020 inventory of active off-site retail sales alcohol licenses in Orange County and compared the distribution of licenses with race/ethnicity across the county. The comparison was repeated at two spatial scales: census tract and a scaled population grid based on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s LandScan 2018 dataset with 30 arc-second cells (∼0.5 miles). This study found that Hispanic populations were consistently overrepresented in census tracts and cells where alcohol licenses were found. This result suggested that requiring laws and regulations to avoid recognition of race is insufficient to ensure race-neutral distributions of benefits and detriments in the built environment.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nSarah Halpern\n\nWetland Mapping and Restoration Decision Making using Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis: A Case Study at the Kawainui Marsh\n\n2nd prize\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, Andrew Marx\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nWetlands are a unique and important ecosystem for our world by serving as one of the largest forms of carbon sequestration and storage while also housing thousands of plant and animal species. As much of Earth’s wetlands are disappearing due to human activities, conserving these natural resources has become even more crucial. Restoration, or the process of returning a degraded area to its original form, is necessary for the future of wetland ecosystems, as well as our world. In the conservation field, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a common tool for wetland assessments. However, they are rarely used for restoration planning, which is mostly done on a larger scale using LiDAR and satellite imagery. Because wetland restoration relies on noting small changes, the flexibility of UAVs may prove to be a more useful tool. As ecosystems that connects land and water, vegetation and hydrology can vary intermittently and may require detailed planning and consistent monitoring. Although other forms of remote sensing can give us accurate DEMs and high-resolution imagery on a large scale, a UAV may be more effective for smaller study areas. The 60-acre Kahanaiki restoration area is an ideal study area for restoration planning with a UAV. This study utilized a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 drone to acquire high-resolution imagery and a 3D point cloud, which was then classified into variables – streams, mudflats, plant species, urban land use, and a 0.15-meter DEM. These criteria were used in a suitability analysis to determine where restoration efforts are most likely to succeed. Along with this, high-resolution imagery of Kahanaiki and 2 other current restoration sites were created for use in future monitoring. The purpose of this study is to assist with conservation research of the Kawainui Marsh by monitoring existing restoration areas and planning ideal locations for future restorationsites. In doing so, the research determined if UAVs can be an effective tool for restoration planning for future wetland mitigation\n\nThesis PDF\n\nIndu Hulisandra\n\nQuantifying land use land cover changes in Monarch butterfly habitat in California\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Andrew Marx, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe Western Monarch butterflies of North America have seen a steep decline in population over the last two decades due to climate changes and land cover changes in the overwintering sites, and the decline of milkweed plants in the breeding grounds due to pesticide glyphosate application. According to a study by the Center for Biological Diversity, over the last two decades, monarch populations overall have declined by 68 percent and the western monarchs have seen nearly 90 percent decline, reducing their overall population from more than one billion to two hundred odd million (Giffiths & Villablanca, 2015). ❧ This project aimed to quantify the land use land cover changes, trend of pesticide Glyphosate application from 1990 to 2015, weather changes from 1990-2015 in the Monterey county, the study area for this project. The land cover and land use change were analyzed using Landsat ARD imagery of 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2018, using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) differencing method. The NDVI image for each year were classified into 5 categories based on the spectral index and the results indicate fluctuation in the land use land cover, however, there is not significant change in any class. The pesticide Use Report showed Grapes and uncultivated agricultural land used high amount of pesticide glyphosate each year. The application had increased from 1996 to 2000 and again it is increasing from 2004. The weather data analysis did not show any inclement weather pattern, which might be unsuitable for monarch winter survival.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nBryan Lam\n\nDeveloping a Replicable Approach for the Creation of Urban Climatic Maps for Urban Heat Island Analysis: A Case Study for the City of Los Angeles, California\n\nAdvisor: Andrew Marx | Committee Members: Steven Fleming, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic developments have changed the environments we live in. One of the effects of urbanization is the Urban Heat Island effect, a phenomenon where urbanized areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural, less developed areas. While an urban climatic map can be a useful tool for understanding the Urban Heat Island effect, there is not consistent methodology for its creation and implementation in urban planning. This reduces its utility in informing policy and decision making in Urban Heat Island mitigation efforts. In response, this study demonstrates an approach for the creation of accurate urban climatic maps, which can be replicated for all of California. Using the city of Los Angeles as an example, this approach successfully produced different urban climates, and estimates how each urban climate affects the Urban Heat Island effect. The urban climatic map overlays various classified layers from multiple fields, such as urban planning and climatology, to construct the climatic classes for the city. These classification values are based off of the values used in the Hong Kong urban climatic map. Each climatic class is a description of the thermal load and dynamic (air movement) potential that is experienced in each area of the city. Classes with high thermal loads and low dynamic potentials can be identified as areas experiencing a more intense urban heat island effect. Using the same methodology, the creation for additional urban climatic maps, or regional climatic maps is possible, greatly improving regional efforts to mitigate Urban Heat Island effects across California.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nLiling Lee\n\nUsing Landscape Integrity Index to Evaluate the Cumulative Impacts of BLM Resource Management Programs\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: John P. Wilson, Su Jin Lee\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is instrumental in connecting people with public lands by providing and protecting opportunities to enjoy and use our country’s resources. Understanding the cumulative effects of resource management programs is crucial for decision makers to develop effective land management practices and appropriate allocation of funding and resources. A comprehensive, standardized, and transparent GIS workflow can help visualize and analyze ecological integrity, landscape patterns and processes, and promote a consistent Cumulative Effects Analysis (CEA) and collaborative management across jurisdiction boundaries. ❧ This research evaluates the cumulative impacts of resource management programs in the BLM Carlsbad Field Office (CFO), New Mexico by incorporating ecological integrity indicators, resource- and stressor-based metrics, and landscape metrics to create a Landscape Integrity Index (LII). Two resource management programs, Vegetative Communities and Minerals – Leasables – Oil and Gas, were selected as the programs of interest for this study. The LII model considers the management goals and objectives in the Draft BLM CFO Resource Management Plan (RMP) to identify the necessary indicators and metrics. These indicators and metrics were each scored for their site impact, distance decay function, or landscape metrics through the use of a Composite Scoring System, and then combined into a single map. The resulting map with the LII values shows areas of low landscape integrity near the urban and agricultural areas in CFO planning area and high landscape integrity near central and southwest corner of CFO. CEA practitioners and land managers will be able to address management goals and objectives, conduct a more systematic and consistent analysis with relevant indicators and metrics, and visualize landscape integrity using the LII framework.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nPatrick McCullen\n\nSpatial Analysis of Veteran Access to Healthcare in Los Angeles County\n\nAdvisor: Katsuhiko Oda & Robert Vos | Committee Members: An-Min Wu,\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine if gaps in health care accessibility existed in Los Angeles County. A primary consideration of this study was the veteran population in Los Angeles County and their accessibility to healthcare. Accessibility is defined by the Veteran Administration (VA) as the acceptable travel time to the nearest VA healthcare center for a veteran to receive desired care. As part of the MISSION (Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks) Act of 2018, veterans may receive primary care outside the VA system if the average drive time to a VA facility is thirty minutes or more. This thesis examines the spatial accessibility for veterans to travel to VA facilities instead of accessing care outside of the VA system. At this time, there are three VA medical centers and seven primary care facilities located throughout Los Angeles County. This study analyzed the areas around the three medical centers and seven primary care facilities and identified gaps in accessing health care based on drive time using the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. It identified where gaps in spatial accessibility exist using veteran estimations at the census tract level extent. The study found that gaps in coverage exist in the eastern area of Los Angeles County. The methodology and detailed analysis can serve to determine differences in drive time distance decay for veterans to access primary medical care in other locations throughout the country.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nKevin Mercy\n\nComparative 3D Geographic Web Server Development: Visualizing Point Clouds in the Web\n\n3rd prize\n\nAdvisor: Andrew Marx | Committee Members: Yao-Yi Chiang, Jennifer Swift\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nGIS Capabilities are rapidly expanding into the web and cloud environments, but there is little research on the capabilities and performance of 3D web GIS exploitation systems. To evaluate current 3D GIS capabilities and performance within the web, Esri ArcGIS Enterprise Portal, Cesium JS, and Hexagon Geospatial Luciad RIA were all configured on a cloud-based Amazon EC2 instance to host and serve 3D tile datasets that implement adaptive tiled data structures. Using two different source point cloud datasets, a high-resolution photogrammetric dataset, and a lower resolution lidar dataset, resource loading time and resource memory was tested within each system with increasing overall tileset sizes and with three different levels of zoom. The results show that while Cesium JS is quickest, Esri ArcGIS Enterprise Portal performs similar and with more detailed visualizations for both datasets. Hexagon Geospatial Luciad RIA performed slower than the other two systems, but possesses the most photorealistic and detailed rendering of the systems. Performance differences between the servers can be seen in the level of library compression and number of libraries imported into the page. Cesium JS is generally quickest, but most compressed and lightweight server. The larger detail and loading time in Esri ArcGIS Enterprise and Hexagon Geospatial Luciad RIA can be traced to smaller levels of compression and more library imports to enhance detail of 3D data rendering. Overall tileset size and spatial resolution of data did not significantly impact performance while zoom level did significantly impact performance. Generally, higher resolution of zoom required more resources and loading time. Results indicated that difference visualization systems are best suited for different applications. Cesium JS would likely be most suited for complex analytic operations, while Hexagon Geospatial Luciad RIA would be best for detailed single scene visualization.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nCraig Misajet\n\nHarnessing GIST-Enabled Resources in the Classroom: Developing A Story Map for Use with Secondary Students\n\nAdvisor: Jennifer Bernstein | Committee Members: Steve Fleming, Katsuhiko Oda\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe number of K-12 educators utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is on the rise. As more tools become available, through companies such as Esri Geoinquiries, Google Maps Treks, and Esri Academy, an ever-rising number of educators employ such tools in their classrooms. This thesis provides a model that educators can use to 1) synthesize the delivery of content in tandem with GIS, 2) ensure adherence to standards-based instructional requirements while using ArcGIS Story Maps, and 3) teach secondary age students to use GIS itself. The case study on which the thesis was based was a template for an ArcGIS Story Map that can house traditional classroom content and GIS-enhanced resources while adhering to national, state, and local student learning outcome standards, as well as incrementally increasing the students’ understanding and use of GIS. The course that was the case study covers eastern hemisphere geography and is taught primarily to freshman in a high school in Meridian, ID. The ArcGIS Story Map was created using the Classic Map Series template and organizes each map around a region of study in the class (e.g. the Middle East, North Africa, etc.). The content of each regional map was based on standards which are linked to student learning outcomes associated with a specific theme (e.g. culture is the thematic focus of the Middle East and North Africa unit). Enrichment content in a variety of multimedia formats was embedded within the content of each region. In addition, each successive regional map asks the student-users to utilize increasingly advanced GIS skills and proficiencies. A survey was fielded to gauge the attitudes of other educators as to the effectiveness of this approach as well as the extent to which they might adopt this approach in their own classrooms. Survey data showed that educators were receptive to this approach and were more likely to adopt it after viewing this application.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nMichelle Ramirez\n\nHousing Affordability Near Metro’s Light Rail – Expo Line & Gold Line\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Katsuhiko Oda, Darren Ruddell\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is the third largest public transportation agency in the country—established in 1993 due to a merger between Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. The mission of the company is to enhance the “quality of life for all who live, work and play within LA County” (Metro’s website). In order to achieve this mission Metro has created services and has invested in bikes, buses, light rails, and rideshare programs. The most impactful investment was into the light rail systems. This rail system includes two rapid subways, four light rails, and ninety-three stations, which spans 105 miles throughout the county. This thesis examined how Metro’s light rail system has influenced the value of single-family residential homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the Expo (South Los Angeles) and Gold (East Los Angeles) lines. This study examined how Metro has transformed the zoned area near these two Metro light rails. In order to analyze the impact, the Hedonic Regression Model was utilized to determine the correlation between these light rails and housing values. A series of maps were created to depict the demographic and physical change over a ten year period. The result of the study showed that the impact that Metro’s light rails was minimal and did not show significant change in the social, economic, and structural landscapes of these communities.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nSarah Rosenthal\n\nUsing GIS to Explore the Tradeoffs in Hydrographic Survey Planning: An Investigation of Sampling, Interpolation and Accuracy\n\nAdvisor: Steven Fleming | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, John P. Wilson\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nThe lack of seafloor information is often a result of the challenging logistics and expenses involved with acquiring data in this unique environment. Yet, despite the sparsely sampled environment, many significant efforts exist to create global bathymetry models. However, there exists a public misunderstanding of the true sampling density in the ocean that can be largely attributed to contemporary interpolation and enhanced cartography. The seafloor is more sparsely sampled than most people realize. Thus, it is important to understand the influence of the underlying source data and the interpolation technique used when creating an accurate digital bathymetry model. The accuracy of a surfaces can depend on sampling density, interpolation method, and local geomorphology. However, if a bathymetry surface can be accurately created using sparse measurements, mission planning can be directed to sample the seafloor at a certain resolution. The results of this thesis research encourage future exploration of a computationally efficient method to assess the best method of interpolation method in different regions under different conditions.\n\nThesis PDF\n\nChris Sanders\n\nBeyond Visual Line of Sight Commercial Unmanned Aircraft Operations: Site Suitability for Landing Zone Locations\n\nAdvisor: Andrew Marx | Committee Members: Laura Loyola, An-Win Wu\n\nAbstract Text (click to show/hide)\n\nCommercial UAS operations are one of the fastest growing industries in the world, exceeding 127 billion dollars per year as of 2016.
