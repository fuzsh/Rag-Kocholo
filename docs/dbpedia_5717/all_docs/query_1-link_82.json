        "text": "Which \"store\" are you referring to for this? If you couldn't find the albums there, then you can't expect mp3tag to find the additional field info.\n\nIf you want to manually add this info, you will need to use a file that does display the info you want. Open this in the Enhanced Tag editor, and find out what field your player is using to store this text. You can then add that same field into the files you want to update, manually adding the new text you want to see.\n\nThe idea is to use an existing file that shows all the details that you also want to see for the added files.\n\nSelect one of these files in MP3tag and open the extended tags dialogue.\n\nThere you check which fields are filled in this file and you then fill the same fields in the new files.\n\nThen you only have to force iTunes to re-read the metadata.\n\nYEAR is the same field for all players, and should match for an entire album. Some try to change these on compilation discs like greatest hits or similar, but this is not standard practice. Either use the original year of release for the album, or if you prefer you can use the rerelease year.\n\nCOPYRIGHT is typically where you would see the data you mentioned in your first post, but it is not always so easy. For iTunes, if I recall correctly, it only works with mp4 format (lossless ALAC or lossy aac). It may not display correctly for mp3 files, but you will need to try, and verify this. (Most other players do not use this field at all, so no guarantees you can use this if you are not in iTunes)\n\nThe correct format for YEAR is just YYYY.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in posted #2 - For the detailed info you posted above, you will need to look at the Enhanced Tag editor for a file that has that info and find which field supports it for your use in iTunes. This is not a \"standard\" ID3 field so I suspect it will be in a tag that starts with ITUNES______ where the blank has some other custom tag name.\n\nAnd again this will only apply to mp4 files, and will not work even in iTunes if added to other file types like mp3.\n\nNorm has the gain normalization data. iTunes can only use one value, so you have to choose whether you want it to be based on track or album replaygain data if you want to use it.\n\nMPB holds other data that is used in iTunes database.\n\nAll of those other fields have data related to the names.\n\nWhat was the end resolution?"
