        "text": "About Us\n\nBedroom Community is a Reykjavík-based record label and a global collective of artists from different musical and cultural backgrounds, working in new classical, alternative and experimental music. The label was founded in 2006 by Icelandic composer and producer Valgeir Sigurðsson and has since been operating out of the renowned Greenhouse Studios. Founding members, the American composer Nico Muhly and Australian-Icelandic producer Ben Frost launched their international careers with the release of Speaks Volumes and Theory of Machines, respectively. Bedroom Community has since become known for genre-defying — and genre-defining — records, and has steadily released seminal works by artists such as Daníel Bjarnason, Sam Amidon, Lyra Pramuk, Nadia Sirota, Manchester Collective, aYia, Emily Hall, Liam Byrne, 404.zero, James McVinnie, Sam Slater and Daniel Pioro.\n\nThe collective spirit of Bedroom Community is its most precious resource. The roster is made up of creatively diverse individuals who are drawn to the murky spaces between genres, and who work at the cutting edge of contemporary music for orchestra, film, TV, theatre, dance, opera, computer games, and art installations.\n\nThe label’s rare and eclectic live events have become a thing of legend since the original Whale Watching Tour launched in 2010. Bedroom Community artists have come together for specially curated, sold-out events at venues such as The Barbican and South Bank Centre in London, Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Philharmonie de Paris, and across key EU/US festivals, venues and clubs. All this has established Bedroom Community as a leading voice and an uncompromising tastemaker in modern music.\n\n\"The best record label in the whole of Iceland and maybe even the entire world.\"\n\nDrowned in Sound\n\n\"The influential Bedroom Community label: a lightning rod at the juncture where the ambition of classical music meets the aesthetics of indie music.\"\n\nPitchfork\n\n\"Bedroom Community have, quietly and modestly, managed to assemble a wonderfully inventive ensemble of artists.\"\n\nFACT Magazine\n\n\"Bedroom Community plays home to some of the most prolific and unique composers and musicians from all over the globe, making it a creative hub of sonic geniuses that continues to evolve and produce incredible work.\"\n\nBlackBook Magazine\n\nDemo Policy\n\nWe are NOT looking for demo submissions at this time, due to the simple fact that we already have a roster that needs all our attention and energy. We are passionate about the music we release on our label.\n\nKeeping this in mind, you can send demos to us, just remember that Bedroom Community is a collective of a close-knit group of individuals and as such we have an overwhelming activity for an independent boutique operation. We try to give everything we receive a listen because we respect your effort in sending us your music, and well... you never know. We cannot promise a response - but rest assured that If see a potential for a collaboration you certainly hear from us. In the meantime, here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when sending your music: We prefer demos sent as links to a stream, instead of CDs or attachments for downloading. Make sure to include the name of the project and your contact info so we know how to find you if we need to. Choose only 2-4 'key tracks', it's not necessary to send a full album to begin with. Compile what you feel best represents what you're doing and send that. If you send a full length record or a long compilation, it's helpful to highlight a couple tracks for suggested listening."
