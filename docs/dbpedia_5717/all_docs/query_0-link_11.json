        "text": "Beach Slang, \"Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us\" (Polyvinyl). After a pair of 2014 EPs made this Philly punk-rock band buzzier than several beehives, Beach Slang could satisfy almost everyone's anticipation with a first album, less than a half-hour long, of Replacements snarl and power-pop shine.\n\nChris Janson, \"Buy Me a Boat\" (Warner Music Nashville). Eleven years ago, Janson was a Missouri boy whose Nashville home was the back seat of a Monte Carlo. Now, thanks primarily to a self-released song for which this new LP is named, he's a major-label Next Big Thing with Tim McGraw as a duet partner.\n\nSharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, \"It's a Holiday Soul Party\" (Daptone). The unwelcome return of Miss Jones's cancer shouldn't dampen the festivities of her first Yuletide collection with the Dap-Kings. She and they don't fake the funk — or soul, or style — on six familiar songs and five originals, including \"Big Bulbs\" and \"Ain't No Chimneys in the Projects.\"\n\n— Jon M. Gilbertson,\n\nSpecial to the Journal Sentinel\n\nMore online\n\nLook for more of this week's new music releases at jsonline.com/music.\n\nMORE NEW RELEASES\n\nBryan Adams, \"Get Up!\" (UMe). Canadian rocker with 1980s hits like \"Summer of '69\" and popster with 1990s hits like \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" attempts a kind of sequel to 1984's \"Reckless\" with the help of producer and ELO frontman Jeff Lynne.\n\nTrey Anastasio, \"Paper Wheels\" (Rubber Jungle/ATO). The Phish alumnus most likely to be recognized on his own puts out his tenth solo LP, on which he and his \"classic\" Trey Anastasio Band try for Stax Studio immediacy and do get a pale groove going.\n\nBabes, \"Unlimited (Five Tears)\" (Barsuk). The one woman and four men of Babes aren't too pent-up by Los Angeles hipness to cry, as demonstrated by the title of their debut full-length of headphone-ready, synthesizer-soaked indie pop.\n\nJonathan Butler, \"Free\" (Rendezvous). On his latest long-player, the South African singer-songwriter is as slick and also as smoothly soulful as any of his gospel-leaning, multiculturally minded, funkified American counterparts.\n\nCar Seat Headrest, \"Teens of Style\" (Matador). Having released 11 albums on Bandcamp in the last four years, Seattle's Will Toledo, the main man of Car Seat Headrest, sifts through that ultra-indie-rock stuff and reworks it, with a full band, for his semi-deliberately ragged, addled-by-intellect first album on an ultra-indie label.\n\nPeter Case, \"HWY 62\" (Omnivore Recordings). Ben Harper and X's D.J. Bonebrake are two of the numerous personnel adding rock 'n' roll energy to the former Nerves and Plimsouls singer and songwriter's troubadour tendencies on his first new full-length in five years.\n\nThe Chills, \"Silver Bullets\" (Fire). Nineteen years after the last set of Chills tunes from New Zealand singer and songwriter Martin Phillipps, the current set of Chills tunes — and fifth Chills LP overall — compensates for MP's illness- and abuse-related absence with pop-rock prettiness from early R.E.M. and insight similar to that of later Robyn Hitchcock.\n\nDef Leppard, \"Def Leppard\" (Mailboat). With its first self-titled album in a 38-year career, the English rock band that helped make hair metal massively commercial and massively tuneful insists that the album represents the artistically purest form of Def Leppard.\n\nDraconian, \"Sovran\" (Napalm). There are many doom-/death-metal bands in Sweden, so Draconian distinguishes itself by making its dramatic, sweeping and periodically pretty fifth full-length, \"about our existence on Earth and stuff like that,\" according to one member.\n\nDrive-By Truckers, \"It's Great to Be Alive!\" (ATO). Recorded during three nights at San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium last autumn, these 35 songs take in the entirety of the existence of the Georgia-based standard-bearers of rock 'n' roll, Southern or otherwise.\n\nEL VY, \"Return to the Moon\" (4AD). With EL VY members Matt Berninger and Brent Knopf known for their \"day\" jobs — the National and Ramona Falls, respectively — one might expect their collaboration to be highly reminiscent of those jobs. One would be mostly right.\n\nEscape the Fate, \"Hate Me\" (Eleven Seven Music). Las Vegas hard-rock band recovers from the departure of three members between 2013 and now, breaks in two newer members and calls upon mainstream-rock producer Howard Benson to keep the voltage steady.\n\nEscort, \"Animal Nature\" (Escort). Near the end of 2011, Escort released a debut long-player that could've passed for a circle of vinyl kept pristine underneath a disco defunct since the 1970s. Near the end of this year, the NYC quintet's second long-player could pass for the best thing played during that disco's grand reopening.\n\nFranks & Deans, \"How Did You All Get in My Room?\" (SquidHat). Vegas — the city that never enforces curfew or bedtime — is the right location for a punk-rock tribute to the Rat Pack that conceals a true ring-a-ding love behind a snarky name.\n\nGEMS, \"Kill the One You Love\" (Carpark). D.C.'s Lindsay Pitts and Cliff Usher are not exploring new lands with the New Wave worship and synthesizer melancholy of the debut long-player from GEMS; nevertheless, they are revamping old pleasures.\n\nG. Love & Special Sauce, \"Loves Saves the Day\" (Brushfire/Universal). G. Love, a proud Philly man currently living in Boston, continues his jam-heavy run with Special Sauce on a rock-heavy disc featuring Ozomatli, Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams.\n\nLalah Hathaway, \"Lalah Hathaway Live\" (Hathaway Entertainment/eOne Music). In 1972, soul, jazz and blues singer Donny Hathaway recorded \"Donny Hathaway Live\" at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, so it's fitting that his daughter Lalah has gone to the same venue for her own live record.\n\nKazuma Jinnouchi, \"Halo 5: Guardians (Original Soundtrack)\" (Microsoft/343 Industries). Composer Jinnouchi, who's handled the music for video games like \"Metal Gear Solid,\" comes back to the \"Halo\" franchise with a 39-track mix of electronic instruments and a 96-piece orchestra working from Abbey Road.\n\nNigel Kennedy, \"Vivaldi: The New Four Seasons\" (Sony Classical). The sometimes-controversial English violinist set a Guinness Book record with a previous version of Vivaldi's concertos; his new version is interpreted through age and maybe wisdom.\n\nThe Marcus King Band, \"Soul Insight\" (Evil Teen). He played his first gig when he was around eight, so Greenville, South Carolina's Marcus King is an old hand at 19, and the introductory LP from his band very tightly blends rock, blues, jazz and funk.\n\nMaluma, \"Pretty Boy Dirty Boy\" (Sony Music Latin). Colombian native, 21, is already a social media and musical star there and now hopes to go big in the United States and in the rest of the Americas with a new record that stretches beyond his reggaeton roots.\n\nSteve Martin & Edie Brickell, \"So Familiar\" (Rounder). The next phase — not counting a forthcoming musical, \"Bright Star\" — in the collaboration between actor-writer-banjoist Martin and singer-songwriter Brickell adds members of Incubus and Cobra Starship, Bela Fleck and strings to 12 new songs with an old-time feel.\n\nMaserati, \"Rehumanizer\" (Temporary Residence). Gulping influences like early Pink Floyd, mid-period Gary Numan and across-the-board Trans Am, this Athens, Ga., band self-produces an album that could be the soundtrack for an unreleased 1985 science-fiction film.\n\nMatriarchs, \"Scandalous Jointz\" (Eulogy Recordings). For super-knowledgeable metal fans, the groups from which this band has drawn members — Ruckus, the Faceless and Hoods — will presumably inspire awe that the avant garde-ish heaviness of \"Jointz\" will maintain.\n\nMichaelangeflow, \"Baked Dayz\" (Running Rampant). If Portland, Ore., seems like the right place for a self-proclaimed \"nerdy hip-hop rhyming type guy\" to lay down goofy words over 8-bit sounds, then you are most perceptive and might enjoy Michaelangeflow.\n\nVan Morrison, \"Astral Weeks (Expanded & Remastered),\" \"His Band and the Street Choir (Expanded & Remastered)\" (Rhino/Warner). After 1969's \"Moondance,\" 1970's \"His Band\" gave Van the Irish Man another signature hit with \"Domino\"; before \"Moondance,\" 1968's \"Astral Weeks\" began his legacy as an agonized poet of soul music.\n\nMovits!, \"They Tried to Bury Us, They Didn't Know We Were Seeds\" (Slimstyle). Due in Milwaukee November 11, the trio, with two brothers, known to \"Colbert Report\" fans as that Swedish oddity in which hip-hop meets swing, finds more ways to facilitate that meeting.\n\nThe Neighbourhood, \"Wiped Out!\" (The Revolve Group/Columbia). California five-piece rock outfit scored a couple alt-rock hits on 2013's introductory full-length \"I Love You,\" giving it some room to try a few new tricks on a foundation of old craft with its follow-up.\n\nPainted Zeros, \"Floriography\" (Don Giovanni). The entry for This Week in Brooklyn Bands is a three-piece fronted by a singer and guitarist, Katie Lau, who conjures up memories of Belly and Lush before she and the other Zeros switch from gazing at their shoes to cranking post-punk toward the sky.\n\nPictureplane, \"Technomancer\" (Anticon). Travis Egedy, a multimedia artist as well as a singer and producer, gets back to artful dancing with his first new album in four years as Pictureplane, providing the sort of synth-pop power that kids these days call \"bangin'.\"\n\nPinkish Black, \"Bottom of the Morning\" (Relapse). Texas duo that uses synthesizers and drums to construct a mad scientist's type of Gothic metal, and its latest LP is much like a horror-movie soundtrack that doesn't really need the movie.\n\nPuscifer, \"Money $hot\" (Puscifer Entertainment). Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan restarts the non-remix end of the Puscifer project with its third full-length, which keeps the idea of \"alternative rock\" alive while celebrating the harvest. (He owns a winery.)\n\nRoots Manuva, \"Bleeds\" (Big Dada). UK rapper Rodney Smith, stage name Roots Manuva, is becoming an elder statesman — his first album came out in 1999 — who, on his newest album, can engage with modern trap-rap beats as well as he can revive those trip-hop vibes.\n\nMarc Scibilia, \"Out of Style\" (I.R.S. Nashville). During the televising of the 2015 Super Bowl, some football fans heard Scibilia's voice on a Jeep ad; this debut full-length from the New Yorker offers many more opportunities to hear his brightly lit retro-modern pop.\n\nT.G. Sheppard, \"Legendary Friends & Country Duets\" (Cleopatra). A country-music chart-topper in the 1970s and 1980s comes back into earshot with songs that feature many a genuine fellow legend both living (Willie Nelson) and dead (George Jones).\n\nSkindred, \"Volume\" (Napalm). The band that made palatable and powerful the idea of \"reggae-bolstered metal from South Wales\" carries a reminder of how unbalanced said idea really is on every track from its latest long-player.\n\nSouleye, \"Shapeshifting\" (Souleye). Massachusetts-born, L.A.-based hip-hop artiste Mario \"Souleye\" Treadway might normally get upstaged by his wife, one Alanis Morissette, but not on his eighth independently released album. (A 20th-anniversary edition of her breakthrough, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" also drops this week.)\n\nLaura Stevenson, \"Cocksure\" (Don Giovanni). Choosing all the loud songs from a batch of 20 or so she wrote for her fourth LP, Long Island singer Stevenson doesn't use volume to bury the whiplash dynamics of the music and the spiteful sweetness of her voice.\n\nStraight No Chaser, \"The New Old Fashioned\" (Atlantic). These a cappella gents are touring close to Christmas and have made holiday records, but SNC's fifth overall full-length mashes up, for example, the Four Seasons with OneRepublic, and also sports the first SNC original to make the cut on one of its full-lengths.\n\nAaron Lee Tasjan, \"In the Blazes\" (First of 3). Maybe three years after relocating from Brooklyn to Nashville's East Side, a singer-songwriter who's also played with New York Dolls and Semi Precious Weapons emphasizes his serious country and rock chops yet also emphasizes his non-serious sense of himself.\n\nVarious artists, \"Joy of Living: A Tribute to Ewan MacColl\" (Compass). Born in 1915, dead in 1989, Englishman MacColl was many things, including an actor and a folk revivalist; this tribute emphasizes his songwriting through the voices of Steve Earle, Billy Bragg, Jarvis Cocker and many others.\n\nVarious artists, \"NOW That's What I Call Music! 56\" (NOW Music). Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato are all here, along with Ed Sheeran, Luke Bryan and 5 Seconds of Summer on the latest K-Telian hits collection in the NOW series.\n\nVarious artists, \"We Love Disney\" (Verve/Walt Disney). Almost everybody's inner child feels special about some song heard in some Disney entertainment, and so do the inner children of Gwen Stefani, Kacey Musgraves, Fall Out Boy et al. who put their fingerprints on those sticky sounds.\n\nRhonda Vincent, \"Christmas Time\" (Upper Management Music). Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, Ronnie Milsap and plenty more C&W stalwarts help bluegrass lady Vincent add four original songs to a selection of classics, including \"Silent Night\" and \"Jingle Bells,\" that her mandolin ought to enliven.\n\nWolf Eyes, \"I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces\" (Third Man). Moving over to Jack White's label, as any intriguing band from Detroit might, the droning, doomy Wolf Eyes funnels the aftershocks of recent upheavals from within and without into six deeply unsettling songs.\n\nThe Yawpers, \"American Man\" (Bloodshot). Denver trio with a Whitmanesque name runs with a lineup of two guitarists and a drummer, although more than a spoonful of the blues adds to a rock 'n' roll bottom end on a sophomore album that might be called \"mega-rowdy.\"\n\nYoung Galaxy, \"Falsework\" (Paper Bag). Montreal's well of electronic pop with very human voices and feelings might be getting deeper, what with this band from that city delivering another assemblage of unmistakable passions shimmering from under silicon surfaces.\n\nYounghusband, \"Dissolver\" (ATP Recordings). In a change of pace for a rock band made up of young Englishmen, this foursome isn't especially cheeky; instead, on its second long-player, it's urban-bucolic, or sooty-lovely, like the trees that manage to flourish on the edge of London parks."
