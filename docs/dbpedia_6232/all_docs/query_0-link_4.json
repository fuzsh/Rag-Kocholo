        "text": "The Gambler Review: A True Story Came to Life\n\nRegardless if you are a gambling fan or not, The Gambler review will provide an enticing topic for a variety of movie enthusiasts out there. Following a true story, the film takes you inside the secret life of a blackjack gambler. Read our The Gambler review to learn more.\n\nWhat Is the Gambler Movie About?\n\nReleased on January 1, 2015 and distributed by Paramount Pictures, The Gambler is a movie about a literature professor who leads a double life by the casino blackjack tables at night. The movie‚Äôs director is Rupert Wyatt. Famous actor Mark Wahlberg stars as the main character, Jim Bennett.\n\nThe film belongs to the drama/crime genre and explores the topic of addictive gambling. It also offers a bit of action for those who like fast-paced movies. There is also a love story for the fans of romance.\n\nThe Gambler: Movie Plot\n\nNaturaly, we will begin our The Gambler review by describing the plot. We hope we do not include too many spoilers and keep your interest high. The Gambler portrays the intriguing story of Jim Bennett ‚Äì a literature professor by day and an avid gambler at night.\n\nWhile he teaches the great literary works to young people and earns a decent living, Bennett also searches for high-adrenaline adventures by night. His love for gambling leads him to the blackjack tables at Mister Lee‚Äôs casino. As you might have guessed, his taste for high stakes casino gambling and expensive thrills leads Bennett into trouble.\n\nThe literature professor soon falls into debt, and becomes prey to a few dangerous people. In the meantime, he falls for his student Amy. The blonde is a young girl, who also lives a double life. During the day, she attends the college where Bennett teaches. At night, she works as a cocktail waitress at the casino the literature professor frequents.\n\nThe Gambler: Memorable Female Characters\n\nAmy seems to have a taste for the bad guys and falls in love with Bennett. However, the romance between the two of them seems rather complicated thanks to all the trouble the gambler has gotten himself into. Thus, Amy is bound to get involved into situations she may have not expected.\n\nAnother interesting female character in The Gambler is Bennett‚Äôs filthy-rich mother. The part is played by celebrated actress Jessica Lange. She appears tough on the outside and bitterly scolds her son for his addiction and lack of good judgement. However, she goes to the bank to get $240,000 to clean one of his debts.\n\nThe Gambler‚Äôs Male Roles: A Brilliant Play\n\nAs for the male characters, The Gambler has a stellar trio of supporting male actors. John Goodman, Michael K. Williams, and Alvin Ing make a great performance. Ing plays Mr. Lee, to whose casino the gambler is indebted. Williams is another gangster called Neville, who is sort of a mentor to Bennett.\n\nAll three of them perform brilliantly, but Goodman is definitely the most fun of them. He plays his entire part shirtless and swears quite a lot. He appears in the role of a parochial character, from whom Bennett borrows money.\n\nAs for Wahlberg, he has gotten into his character pretty well. He has a pale and unhealthy expression, but still manages to be cocky and escape in the face of danger. His intelligence shines through the clever schemes he makes to evade his enemies and get out of trouble.\n\nThe Critics‚Äô Verdict\n\nThe critics have been fairly divided in their The Gambler reviews. Some claim the movie is more suitable for the action genre and does not fully correspond to the drama criteria. Others rate it highly and praise the fast-paced screenplay.\n\nCritics also widely differ in their evaluation of Wahlberg‚Äôs play. While the majority find his character quite likeable, the rest do not estimate his performance as plausible enough. In any case, even if he does not play the part, Wahlberg at least looks it.\n\nInteresting Facts about The Gambler\n\nThe Gambler is the modern-day remake of the 1974 movie of the same name. The original film was directed by Karel Reisz and starred James Caan as the gambler. Both the movie and the main character were very well accepted by the critics. The plot was penned by screenwriter James Toback.\n\nInterestingly enough, The Gambler is based on a true story. This was revealed many years after the original was released. In 2011, screenwriter Toback published an essay, where he said that he wrote the script describing his personal experience.\n\nToback revealed that after graduating from Harvard in 1966, he began leading a double life, just as his main character. In his daytime, he would teach literature and writing at a prestigious CCNY program alongside other famous writers. At night, however, he would gamble at the local casinos.\n\nIn an attempt to make sense out of his experience, Toback started writing The Gambler. Initially plotted as a novel, it then evolved into a movie script. This is how the 1974 film was born. Toback included in it a lot of original experiences and dialogues from his life as a casino gambler.\n\nThe Gambler: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nNow that you have read our entire The Gambler review, you know the major details about the movie, the plot, and the characters.
