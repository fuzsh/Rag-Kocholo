        "text": "In the shadows of the most well-known Casinos in the world, with the distant glow of the neon lights of the Las Vegas Strip in the background, there is a gathering of 110 people that have the cumulative success, analytical ability and overall brilliance that is usually reserved for the audience of Nobel Prize acceptance speeches.\n\nEvery year, from as far away as Australia and Hong Kong, hedge fund managers, top executives from Fortune 500 companies, scores of the best known professional gamblers in the world, and no less than 4 billionaires, converge on Las Vegas to attend the Blackjack Ball. The common thread that binds them all is that they each have made significant contributions to advance the cause of advantage players of casino games. Simply stated, all the attendees have legally succeeded at beating the casinos at their own game(s), and on a grand scale.\n\nAs one can expect, attaining an invitation to this event was no small feat. A candidate must first be nominated by a sitting member of the Blackjack Hall of Fame, and then be approved by the attendance committee. My journey towards being invited began some 19 years ago, at the age of 18, when I first read the classic card counting text Beat the Dealer by Ed Thorp. Since then, my resume includes the completion of multiple graduate degrees, managing a professional blackjack team, the development of two original casino slot games, becoming a leading analytical consultant and gaming writer, as well as successfully engaging in litigation against Caesars Entertainment . This evening was one that I had long awaited for, and one I will never forget.\n\nThe location of the Blackjack Ball is one of the most closely guarded secrets among advantage gamblers and for good reason. If a casino employee were to discover its location it would make that employee’s career, and at the same time destroy the livelihood of several great players.\n\nThe night began with me driving my mid-sized silver rental car toward the 7 foot high steel security gate of the recently disclosed location. I gave my name to the security guard, and she promptly located it on her master list and opened the gate. After parking, I walked toward the club house’s main entrance and was stopped at a table 15 yards from the door where I was asked for identification, which I gave without hesitation.\n\nThe longtime organizer and originator of the Blackjack Ball, Max Rubin was called and only after he verified my invitation, was I allowed to proceed. Max met me at the door, we shook hands and I handed him a premium chilled bottle of champagne in the form of a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon. A chilled bottle of premium champagne is requested by each attendee and it goes far to ensure that the evening is special for all present. He then escorted me beyond 3 armed security guards and I was in.\n\nThe security precautions may seem excessive, but to any advantage gambler the situation is a perfect metaphor, insofar as the casinos go to great lengths to portray advantage gamblers as undesirables, and in many cases define them as criminals from whom they need to protect themselves at all costs. In reality, the advantage gamblers are the ones that need protection from the casinos. In most cases advantage players are extremely bright and talented people who have been motivated for one reason or another to play casino games for profit. Let’s take a look at a few attendees of the Blackjack Ball and see if they deserve the criminal labels that are bestowed upon them by casino personnel.\n\nBlair Hull founded Hull Trading Company in 1985 and served as the firm’s Chairman and chief executive officer before selling it to Goldman Sachs in 1999 for $531 million. Trader Monthly recognized Hull for having executed one of \"The 40 Greatest Trades of All Time\" and Worth Magazine named him one of \"Wall Street’s 25 Smartest Players.\" Hull has also been honored by The Options Industry Council as the 2014 recipient of the Joseph W. Sullivan Options Industry Achievement Award\" in recognition of his outstanding lifetime contributions to the growth and integrity of the U.S. options market.\n\nBill Benter developed arguably the most successful computer software in the world to attack the giant Hong Kong horse racing market. During the 2010 racing season the betting turnover in Hong Kong reached $9.23 billion, on just two racetracks! By comparison, all the thoroughbred racetracks in the U.S. combined, took in just over $12 billion in 2010. Bill heads the Benter Foundation in Pittsburg PA, where he oversees the distributions of millions of dollars annually to a variety of causes in education, health, and the fine arts.\n\nMax Rubin is a 47-year gaming industry veteran, award winning author, long term member on the American Association’s Advisory Board for the Global Gaming Expo, former professional blackjack player and an exclusive consultant for the Barona Resort and Casino in San Diego CA. As the home of the Blackjack Hall of Fame and Sponsor of the Blackjack Ball, Barona has long been the envy of gaming resorts across America. It is one of the very few gaming operations that have shown consistent year-to-year growth and extraordinary financial success over the past decade; Barona has achieved its unprecedented success by employing a very simple strategy: Give players what they want, while they play. By providing unprecedented “time on device” (that defies industry standards), offering the loosest slot machines and loosest table games possible, issuing loose comps and then feeding players while they gamble, Barona has developed unparalleled Player Loyalty that continues to make them the dominant gaming operation in the San Diego market.\n\nJames Grosjean is considered by most of his peers in advantage gaming to be the greatest intellectual engineer and practitioner of advantage gaming to have ever lived. Max Rubin stated “In all the years I have thrown the Blackjack Ball when success is measured as function of skill, will and focus no one even comes close to Grosjean.” James is a graduate of Harvard University and attained a Masters’ Degree from the University of Chicago’s, School of Economics. James authored Beyond Counting Exhibit CAA. It is one of the most comprehensive books on advantage gaming ever published.\n\nThese four people are a small subset of the Blackjack Ball guest list. It is by no means the cream of the crop of the attendees. A random selection of any 4 attendees would yield an equally impressive set of backgrounds. This begs the questions: what is it about the game of blackjack, and more importantly, the skills one acquires when attempting to beat the game of blackjack, that has contributed to the overall success of each attendee? Throughout the evening I was able to discuss the impact that blackjack has had on the lives of many of the guests.\n\n2016 Blackjack Hall of fame inductee Bill Benter touched on this subject during his acceptance speech. After thanking the men who first conceptualized and, subsequently, practiced advantage blackjack play, Professor Ed Thorp and Stanford Wong, Bill Benter thanked the game of blackjack itself. In a profound argument for engaging in advantage play; Bill stated:\n\nThe game of blackjack is a tremendous teacher. It teaches us the importance of study and preparation. Advantage Players have such a narrow edge that it is vital that when we desire to succeed, it is important that we focus our efforts on that goal, because the slightest misstep can be the difference between success and failure. And that reasoning is a perfect analogy for life. Blackjack teaches us the importance of teamwork, and the humbling effect of knowing that you can have a bad day but still feel good because you take solace in knowing you did everything right. And just because it didn’t work out that day it doesn’t mean it will not work most days.\n\nBlair Hull often gives talks about his experiences as a stock and options trader; he describes his core competencies as systematic, data driven and disciplined. In a brief conversation with me he said these values were firmly instilled in him during his blackjack training and play by his mentor and friend Blackjack Hall of Famer Al Francesco. Blair is convinced that if it was not for the game of blackjack he would be driving a cab somewhere. Even though I am not convinced that this would be the case, it illustrates how important he believes blackjack was in shaping who he has become.\n\nRick Blain a retired Wall-Street investment wizard and author of many books on advantage play, whose slicked back hair and $5000 suit created a presence that reminded me of Gordan Gecko from the 1987 film Wall Street, derived his management style from his time leading professional blackjack teams. His approach:\n\nTreat the people that work for you as partners rather than employees. Only when you get to know them as a person can you truly understand what motivates them and, in turn get their best out of them.\n\nRick was awarded the title of the “Worlds’ Greatest Blackjack Player” in 2015.\n\nDon Johnson is without questions one of the most famous blackjack players in the world. Don reaped extraordinary profits over a decade ago while executing a variety Advantage Plays. But as these opportunities became harder and harder to come by, Don had to revise his approach. A chance encounter with a pair mathematicians and advantage players helped him to do this. “They completely changed the way I looked at the game” stated Johnson. Don’s exploits grew to epic proportions after he beat three Atlantic City casinos for over $15 million several years ago, while utilizing those casinos’ loss rebate programs. While luck certainly was a factor in his extraordinary Atlantic City wins, his openness to new approaches is an attribute firmly rooted in his ongoing study of blackjack.\n\nThe lessons derived from advantage play are not limited to the business world. The Australian native Zeljko Ranogajec, who began his professional career with just a few thousand dollars playing low limit games, is without question the most successful gambler ever, no one even comes close. Many people have tried to estimate his lifetime winnings but I have concluded that doing so is a fool’s errand. I asked Zeljko “What is it that he most attributes his success to?” He said “the standard answer is you really have to love what you are doing.” Ranogajec has long since moved away from casino gaming but has held on to that philosophy and, has applied it to his family life. He immediately lights up when he speaks of them. As great of a professional gambler as he is, I get the distinct impression that it is a distant second to his abilities as a father.\n\nIn the books and movies the life of advantage players are greatly romanticized. I asked John Chang, on whom the character of Mickey Rosa is based in the New York Times best-seller Bringing Down the House and subsequent movie 21, that chronicled the events of the M.I.T. Blackjack teams about this. He firmly stated that “the book got it about half of it right and the movie threw out that half”. In reality, advantage players are vilified by casinos, plain and simple. From the resumes of the people mentioned so far, the only threat that exists is the one to the casinos bottom line. From what I can conclude an industry wide policy to harass and persecute advantage players’ has been adopted ever since Thorp's book Beat the Dealer was published in 1962. And sometimes the casinos actions do cross the legal limit. Enter legal eagles Bob Nersesian and Thea Sankiewicz.\n\nBob is the most visible member of the of the married couple’s legal practice. Writing two books on gaming law: Beat the Player and The Law for Gamblers and, is the only non-professional player ever inducted in to the Blackjack Hall of Fame. However, Thea’s knowledge of the law, deductive reasoning and critical thinking ability is without peer. The Las Vegas based law offices of Nersesian & Sankiewicz have represented hundreds of advantage players over the years, including the one writing this article, resulting in settlements and jury trial awards from casinos, in a cumulative range of tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn fiscal year 2015 Nevada casinos had their best year in a long while. They only managed to lose approximately $662 million. Believe it or not this is a vast improvement over previous years. Regular Blackjack Ball attendee Anthony Curtis is a 30 year veteran of the gaming industry. He is the publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor website as well as the publisher at Huntington Press, which is the largest publisher of books on advantage gaming.\n\nThe biggest change he has seen in the past 3 decades is that casino resorts have been moving away from gaming and more towards non-gaming revenue streams. This is contrary to what first made Las Vegas successful. Anthony estimates the current revenue breakdown from casino resorts is approximately 35% from gaming and 65% from non-gaming. This means that casino resorts are catering more towards people in their 20s’and early 30s'. This is dumbfounding to me because the majority of that demographic does not have nearly as much disposable income as the players that made casinos successful in the past. This demographic is too busy raising a family or paying down student debt.\n\nNoticeably absent from this year’s Blackjack Ball was Professor Ed Thorp. Even though Professor Thorp was called away at the last minute, I was able to speak with him by phone. Professor Thorp is President of Edward O. Thorp & Associates. His personal investment portfolio is reported to have yielded an annualized 20 percent rate of return, averaged over 28.5 years. Professor Thorp wrote Beat the Dealer in 1962. It was the first mathematically based text on advantage play and card counting ever made widely available to the public. I asked Professor Thorp what drove him to evaluate the viability of beating blackjack. He replied:\n\nConventional wisdom by mathematicians at the time was that all casino games could not be beaten, but while on a trip to Las Vegas I decided to play blackjack and there were things about the game that I noticed immediately that did not fall in line with what was thought to be true.\n\nThe biography of every person at the Blackjack Ball starts with the same phrase: “I read Beat the Dealer by Ed Thorp in ….” As a former collegiate instructor I know first-hand that the goal of any teacher is to impact their students’ lives in such a way that it drives them to succeed. I asked Thorp how it made him feel to have had such a positive impact on the lives of so many successful people. Thorp said to me:\n\nGetting people to be excited about math applications makes me feel good and the fact that so many have made so much money playing blackjack and by extension in the stock and options markets makes me feel really good.\n\nIn November 2016 Random House will publish Thorps’ new book titled A Man for All Markets. The book will be a memoir and commentary on his life since he first wrote Beat the Dealer in 1962. It will also offer insights on the general business of life.\n\nWith so many great players in one place the question that instinctively arises in one’s mind is: “Who is the best player here?” Because Max Rubin is so clever, he came up with a way to answer this question. Every year all attendees compete for the title of the World’s Best Blackjack Player by answering a series of complex questions on gaming related issues. The questions are a combination of non-technical and math based problems. The winner is awarded the Grosjean Cup. It is named after James Grosjean who was barred from competition 7 years ago because he took first or second place in every competition in the decade prior to him being banned from competing. This year the Grosjean Cup took the form of a Nebuchadnezzar (a 15 liter bottle) of Luc Belaire Rare Rose champagne courtesy of Don Johnson.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of questions, the two finalists were John Chang and Lee Jensen (This is not his real name). The winner would be determined by a final card counting contest. Each player was given two decks of cards with a single card missing. Using any card counting system they wanted, each player had to determine the missing card. In the end youth triumphed over experience when Lee shouted out the value of the card a split second before the Hall of Famer John Chang.\n\nAfter the presentation of the Grosjean Cup, the after-party at the secondary location commenced. Here tradecraft secrets are exchanged and new partnerships are formed. Not with long and complex contracts, but with a handshake and smile. It is at these after-parties that first time attendees get to experience the true camaraderie that exist between professional players and, where all attendees affirm that the real currency of this profession is not dollars but trust.\n\nWhen the close to this amazing evening approached, many of the guests began gathering their coats and saying their goodbyes to both old friends, and new. With faint smiles across many of the faces, the anticipation of next year’s event began to sprout. And as business cards were exchanged and emails written down it struck me just how passionate this group of extraordinary men and women are about what they do. I can only surmise that their success is not fueled by the desire of money or power, but by the willingness to take on the challenge of solving problems that very few people even understand. Whether it is beating casino games, managing companies or predicting the stock market these men and women give every ounce of energy and intelligence to that end, and whatever the outcome is, they are gratified. In today’s charged environment, where so many are focused on the negative aspects of the world, finding that positive content is exceedingly rare. But if a person works hard enough and is lucky enough he or she will attain that elusive goal. And when that happens, that person will realize that every seemingly wrong turn, missed opportunity and setback was a straight line leading precisely to where he or she wanted to be. In my particular case that destination was the 2016 Blackjack Ball."
