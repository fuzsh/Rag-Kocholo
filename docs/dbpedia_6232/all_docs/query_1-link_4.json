        "text": "After racking up a debt of $44,000 in one night of gambling, English literature college professor Axel Freed apprehensively drives to his morning class. During his lecture, Axel endeavors to convince pragmatic African-American student Spencer of author Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s view that will and desire can overcome any circumstance. Later, Axel visits his girl friend Billie, who is stunned when he casually reveals that amount of his gambling debt. Axel then visits his mother Naomi, a physician, and after a game of tennis over lunch, asks her for ten thousand dollars. Aware of her son’s gambling habit, Naomi demands to know if he owes that amount, but Axel hastily explains that he only wants to know if he can count on her should he need it. Disturbed by his cavalier attitude, Naomi departs angrily. That afternoon, Axel meets Carmine, an associate of club owner, Monkey. On the way to meet a loan shark, Carmine asks Axel to accompany him to the apartment of another debtor, whom he nonchalantly beats for non-payment. Telling Axel he has forty-eight hours to meet his obligation to Monkey’s organization, Carmine drops him off at a restaurant to meet loan shark Bernie. When Axel reveals that he earns fifteen hundred dollars a month and has no collateral, Bernie scoffs at his request for $20,000, prompting Axel to walk out. Back at his apartment, Axel meets his waiting bookie, Hips, who is disappointed that Axel does not yet have the money. When Hips warns Axel not to go to another bookie to make the money gambling, Axel insists he will find it on his own. The next day, Axel attends a large family gathering to celebrate the eightieth birthday of his grandfather, retired grocery chain owner A. R. Lowenstein. While dancing with Naomi, Axel assures her he has no need of the money, but she remains doubtful. Later, Axel invites his mother to the beach, and while she wades in the surf, he writes the amount of his debt in the sand. Stunned when Axel confesses he owes that amount, Naomi berates her son for his involvement with criminals and wonders how she could have raised someone with such low morals. Ignoring Naomi’s distress, Axel asks if she intends to help him and she responds by slapping him. Later, however, Naomi gives Axel the money but cautions him to consider what he is doing with his life. After leaving a message with Hips that he has the money, Axel invites Billie to his afternoon lecture, in which he discusses the way in which writers have expressed the need for risk-taking and embracing change. Afterward, Axel takes Billie to A. R.’s well appointed home, and while she swims, Axel’s grandfather advises him that Billie is too common for him. Driving away, Axel stops at a phone booth to arrange a bet on college football games and grows angry when the bookie refuses unless he provides cash up front. Driving away recklessly, Axel disregards Billie’s alarm and, stopping again at another phone booth, calls the bookie back and insists he has the cash and bets $45,000 on various teams. Infuriated by Axels’ rashness, and realizing he intends to use his debt payment money to cover the bet, Billie leaves the car, determined to walk home. Picking her up further down the road, Axel impulsively invites her to fly with him to Las Vegas. Upon arriving there hours later, Axel hits a lucky streak in roulette and twenty-one at various casinos, using the money from Naomi. At one hotel bar, Axel cheerfully watches the sports report and learns that the college teams he has bet on are all ahead, although still playing. Content when his winnings reach $45,000, Axel stops gambling and the next day he and Billie return to New York. Soon after Axel and Billie arrive at his apartment, sports-bookie Jimmy arrives, nervous because Axel has been away, and demands his payment for the football games debt. Confused, Axel tells Jimmy that he owes him, but Jimmy points out that the teams Axel selected ultimately all lost. Stunned, Axel turns over his entire Vegas winnings to the delighted Jimmy. A few moments after Jimmy departs, Axel races after him to arrange a $50,000 bet on a professional basketball game in progress. When Jimmy insists that Axel must provide the cash up front, Axel gives him Naomi’s money, to Billie’s dismay. Later, Axel explains to Billie that his pleasure in gambling comes from his satisfaction in overcoming his fear of losing and in being in control of his destiny, but she remains saddened by his actions. Anxious over the latest bet, Axel listens to the game on the radio and hears his team lose. Visiting Hips the next morning, Axel confesses that he does not have the money, after which the bookie gives him an additional twenty-four hours. Axel then goes to Monkey and pleads that he be allowed to make a small wager on another sports game to earn his repayment. Monkey agrees, and although Axel wins, the amount is a trifle, which angers Hips. Upon visiting Billie, Axel is frustrated when she tells him they need time apart. While reflecting in a park later, Axel is chased and picked up by two men who take him to a warehouse. There he meets the head of the gambling syndicate, One, who asks Axel how he intends to meet his debt, which ultimately rests with him. Admitting that his mother is “tapped out,” Axel hints that he might ask his grandfather for the amount. Declaring that he has known and respected A. R. for over thirty years and that he is \"no schmuck,\" One reveals he has already asked him for the money and been refused, which stuns Axel. When Axel admits under questioning that one of his students, Spencer, is the star of the basketball team, One orders him to fix their next game to win by under seven points. When Axel protests, One informs him he has no choice in the matter. That afternoon, Axel summons Spencer to his office and uncomfortably offers him five thousand dollars to fix the next game. Shrewdly aware of Axel’s gambling predilections, Spencer agrees, but with the stipulation that it is a one-time situation and he will only deal with Axel. Before the game, Axel visits A. R. and confesses that he feels let down by his grandfather’s refusal to pay his debt and for his association with One. A. R., a self-made millionaire, sharply reprimands Axel for misjudging him and states he dealt with One only when he “had to.” Disappointed by Axel’s naïveté, A. R. nevertheless asks if he needs assistance, but the disillusioned Axel departs for the game. After Spencer performs as expected, Hips cheerfully greets Axel to report One is satisfied and the debt has been repaid. When Hips expresses hope that the game-fixing might continue, however, Axel insists that it is not possible. Refusing Hips’s invitation to dinner, Axel walks to an African-American neighborhood and at a bar, picks up a prostitute whose pimp is then furious when Axel refuses to pay him. In a cheap hotel room, Axel tries to goad the pimp into killing him, then beats him when the man hesitates. After the terrified hooker slashes Axel across the face with a knife, Axel stumbles downstairs to the hotel lobby where he faintly smiles after catching sight of his bloodied face in a mirror."
