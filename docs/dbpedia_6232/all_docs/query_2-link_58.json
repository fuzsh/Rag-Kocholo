        "text": "Rounders is widely considered by gambling experts to be one of the most authentic films ever made on the topic. Gamblers love it, but general audiences never quite gelled to the movie, which only made $22 million at the box office, despite starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton. Damon's character, Mike, promises his girlfriend he'll give up poker after losing his $30,000 tuition money to a Russian gangster. He keeps that promise until old pal Worm gets out of jail. Worm has debts to settle, so Mike helps him get involved in a few games. But when those turn out to be failures, the only way Mike can help his buddy to is break the promise that he'd stay away from the tables.\n\nBoth actors give career-highlight performances in Rounders. The excellent supporting cast includes Gretchen Mol, John Malkovich, John Turturro, and Martin Landau. The movie also offers a compelling examination of the psychology of poker players. Mike and Worm have developed ways to trick and/or read their opponents. Watching them in action - and knowing they're in grave danger if they cross the gangster - provides non-stop tension.\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels follows four friends who get in a sticky situation after playing a high-stakes poker game with a crime lord. He cheats, leaving them half a million pounds in debt. With only one week to pay it off lest bad things happen to them, the guys decide to rob some other crooks. From there, a lot of violent mayhem begins.\n\nDirector Guy Ritchie gives his movie a fast pace, a streak of dark humor, and a gritty style that underlines how dangerous on-the-side gambling can be. It's one thing to do it in a professional casino, but doing it with lowlifes adds a level of physical anger. Adding to the fun is that none of the characters is what you'd call a conventional hero, so we get to watch them all work feverishly to screw one another over.\n\nIn Richard Donner's big-screen adaptation of the old TV show Maverick, Mel Gibson plays the title character, a card sharp who wants to enter a major poker contest. He doesn't have the cash to get in, so he has to utilize his scamming abilities to win lower-stakes games and earn the entrance fee. Meanwhile, a lawman (played by James Garner) is hot on his heels.\n\nMaverick was a mid-sized box-office hit when it was released in 1994, but it hasn't maintained the ongoing popularity that some of Gibson's other films of that period have. That's a shame, because it's got a clever plot, witty dialogue, and an ace supporting performance from Jodie Foster as a con artist. Several solid action scenes add to the fun. As for the gambling, Maverick offers a lighthearted look at the psychological tricks people use in order to win at poker.\n\nCalifornia Split follows two gamblers, Charlie (Elliott Gould) and Denny (George Segal). Together, they go on an all-out gambling spree, looking to make the proverbial big score. The two may share a love of gambling, but they couldn't be more different personality-wise. Charlie is a fun-loving guy, whereas Denny is a lot moodier. The story mostly revolves around their friendship during this trip.\n\nDirector Robert Altman specialized in creating tapestries of characters, and California Split is no different. There may be two men in the center, but the movie also gives time to a host of fascinating supporting players. The result is a picture that immerses you in the gambling culture, making you feel like you're temporarily living among these people. In a career full of acclaimed movies, this is widely considered one of Altman's best and most observant.\n\nInveterate gamblers are typically very superstitious. They believe random things can ruin their luck when they're on a hot streak. The Cooler plays on this idea. William H. Macy is Bernie, a professional jinx whose job is to meander through the casino and brush up against winning gamblers. As soon as he does this, they begin to lose. His career is put in jeopardy after he falls in love with waitress Natalie (Mario Bello). Being happy starts to take away his ability to spread bad luck, to the great dismay of the casino's manager (Alec Baldwin).\n\nThe Cooler digs into the kinds of superstitions that are ubiquitous in Las Vegas. It additionally reveals some of the little tricks casinos use to subliminally play with gambler's minds. Macy is extraordinarily effective as the sad-sack Bernie. We feel real empathy for him as his personal life improves and his professional life wanes. This often darkly funny film takes a fresh viewpoint on the world of gambling.\n\nDid you know that Woody Harrelson, David Cross, Ray Romano, Mike Epps, Cheryl Hines, Judy Greer, Jason Alexander, and Werner Herzog made a movie together? Probably not, because The Grand earned just over $115,000 when it was released in theaters in 2007. You don't get much more under-the-radar than that.\n\nThe reason to see this movie is that it was created under fascinating circumstances. The story involves a bunch of gamblers taking part in a poker tournament. Each actor in the all-star cast was given a character to play, but they had to improvise their dialogue. From there, they played actual games of poker against one another, so nobody knew what the plot's outcome would be. It all depended on who won for real. This oddball structure makes The Grand compulsively watchable. You never know what's going to be said or done next, because the stars didn't either."
