        "text": "Last winter, I found myself in card clubs again. Maybe every 10th or 11th day, nothing too disturbing. I haven’t been a good card player for years; at some point, you simply accept that you’re not playing to win, at least not to win consistently. This might sound like a problem, but when you’re losing only what you can afford to lose, the guilt can be rationalized away. You could have paid for a nice dinner and a nice bottle (or two) of wine with the money you lost tonight, but that dinner would have lasted only two hours at most, and you played cards for six hours – and so forth.\n\nOn one of these nights, I met a 23-year-old kid who grew up in my hometown. He told me that he had dropped out of college after his freshman year to have a go at professional poker. He was doing pretty well, all things considered — he made enough money to pay rent, buy clothes and attend music festivals. What else does a 23-year-old need in New York City?\n\nThis kid beat me in a hand for about $180 that night, but we formed a friendship. I would text him, and he would invariably be playing somewhere in the city, and I would head down, dump a few chips and talk to him about hand strategy, game selection, poker theory — all the things I was interested in when I was a younger, more optimistic card player. We took a few road trips to Atlantic City, where we were comped rooms thanks to the off-season and urban decay. He would almost always win, and although I wasn’t winning or losing any more than usual, I felt, for the first time in years, the insane yet pleasant hope that I might start winning. The kid made it seem possible.\n\nIn July, he went to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker. I staked part of his buy-in to one of the tournaments, and he sent me updates throughout his run to a respectable finish in the money. Then, for the next five days, I didn’t hear from him at all. Anyone who has watched a gambling movie knows what happened to the kid in Vegas and can guess what kept happening once he got back to New York.\n\nEvery gambling story ends the same way. This, oddly enough, is what makes it the perfect narrative for movies. The American epic requires an easy binary, preferably one that connotes complexity without actually being complex. All of gambling’s conflicts — the swings between debt and no debt, the blunt debauchery and the blunter piety — can be clearly broadcast across Paul Newman’s beautiful face. The director of a gambling film really needs only an actor who suffers well and the courage to clear everything else off the table.\n\nPlot lines within the genre are simple by necessity. There is really only one: the gambler falls into debt; the gambler goes after one big score to get even; the gambler either does or does not get even. The variations on that story depend, mostly, on whether the filmmaker sees gambling as a catastrophic vice or a charming hustle.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
