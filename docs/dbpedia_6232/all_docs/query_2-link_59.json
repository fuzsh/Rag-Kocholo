        "text": "Gambling and cinema go hand in hand. The act of turning over a card or the spin of a roulette wheel lend themselves particularly well to dramatic mediums, with some of cinema’s most iconic scenes taking place inside casinos. In this article, we are going to take a look at 30 of the most popular casino movies of all time.\n\nCasino (1995)\n\nCasino is one of Martin Scorsese’s most popular movies. Coming in the middle of the 1990s, the film has all of the trademarks of one of his greats. Scorsese regular Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro play two gangsters, with De Niro[‘s Sam Rothstein overseeing the casino. While the film may be called Casino, this movie is a character piece more than anything, and, like the rest of Scorsese’s films, a deep dive into the underbelly of America.\n\nHere is the Gambling Zone list of the best online casino sites.\n\nMaverick (1994)\n\nWhen you think of Mel Gibson, comedy might not be the first thing that springs to mind. However, he is in fine comic form in Richard Donner’s Maverick. This Western comedy focuses on Gibson’s character, Bret Maverick, as he heads around the Wild West attempting to get the money together for a poker game.\n\nCasino Royale (2006)\n\nDaniel Craig is widely considered one of the greatest James Bonds of all time, and he made an instant impact in his 2006 debut, Casino Royale. After a poor run of films with Pierce Brosnan in the lead role, Casino Royale took Bond back to its roots, and the casino scene between Craig’s Bond and Mads Mikkelsen’s Le Chiefre is one of the franchise’s most iconic encounters.\n\nOcean’s Eleven (2001)\n\nRemakes are always a bit of a gamble, but the Ocean’s Eleven remake was a roaring success. George Clooney leads a gang of star-studded criminals as they attempt to rob a Vegas Casino. This inspired two sequels and an all-female-led spin-off and is one of the best casino movies of the 21st Century.\n\nThe Gambler (1974) Movie\n\nThe Gambler (1974)\n\nJames Caan is one of the best actors of the 1970s, so it was only fitting he starred in a movie about gambling, one of the most genres of the decade. In the film, he plays Axel Freed, a man desperate to get himself out of the gambling debt he has built up with criminals.\n\nThe Hustler (1961)\n\nPaul Newman is one of the coolest men to have ever graced the silver screen, and The Hustler is one of his most iconic outings. In the film, Newman plays Fast Eddie, a pool hustler who wants to make his way to the very top of high-wagering pool leagues. The film received rave reviews and picked up several Academy Awards.\n\n21 (2008)\n\nA group of Maths wizzes bringing down a casino is a classic set-up, but it is executed well in the 2008 hit 21. The film stars Jim Sturgess, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey and is based on a group of Maths students from MIT that become experts in card counting and head to Vegas to make their millions.\n\nRain Man (1988)\n\nRain Man is probably the most successful movie on this list. The 1998 classic was huge at the box office, grossing around $400m and being the highest-grossing movie of the year. It also received great critical success, winning Best Picture and three other Academy Awards. It tells the story of two estranged brothers who take a trip to Vegas to attempt to win big at the casinos.\n\nThe Sting (1973)\n\nOne of the most iconic gambling movies of all time, The Sting is one of two titles on this list to have won Best Picture. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are excellent in the lead role, with George Roy Hill’s stylish direction helping immerse players into the world of high-stakes gambling.\n\nDark City (1950) Movie\n\nDark City (1950)\n\nDark City is a classic poker movie starring Charlton Heston in his feature debut. The film tells the story of some undercover poker games, combining sleazy noir settings with a sharp script and some excellent performances from Heston, Lizabeth Scott, and others.\n\nRounders (1998)\n\nIf you are looking for a great film about poker, then Rounders should be your first stop. Matt Damon, fresh off his success with Good Will Hunting, plays a professional poker play that pits his wits against criminals and other pros in this cult classic that is essential viewing for gamblers.\n\nAtlantic City (1980)\n\nOther than Las Vegas, Atlantic City might be the most iconic casino city in the US. This is considered one of the best movies with gambling ever produced, detailing a romance in the city, with Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon in the lead roles. Like all the best gambling movies, there is plenty of crime and drama thrown in for a good mix. The film landed five Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nYou do not get much more old Hollywood than Humphrey Bogart playing a private eye that helps a beautiful women clear her gambling debts. This is one of the oldest films on this list, but it has remained a popular choice among gamblers for a reason, and its quality still persists.\n\nThe Card Counter (2021)\n\nPaul Schrader is one of cinema’s darkest and most interesting directors, and The Card Counter is one of his more challenging recent works. Oscar Issac plays the titular card counter, with the film using poker and casinos to explore existentially-driven themes like grief and faith. Paul Schrader is the man that wrote Taxi Driver, so that should give you an idea of what to expect from The Card Counter.\n\nCroupier (1998) Movie\n\nCroupier (1998)\n\nCroupier was a sleeper hit upon its first release, but it quickly gained a word-of-mouth reputation and helped launch the career of Clive Owen. In the movie, Owen plays a struggling writer who becomes a Croupier to make ends meet. He soon finds himself caught up in the world of money, gambling, and casinos. It is one of the more meditative movies about gambling, with critics praising its atmosphere and characterisation.\n\nBugsy (1991)\n\nIf you were asked to list key elements from gambling films, you would probably say mobsters, casinos, sordid romance, corruption, and a little sprinkle of violence. Bugsy has all these, documenting the real-life romance between Ben “Bugsy” Siegl and Virginia Hill. Warren Beatty and Annette Betting excel in the lead roles, while Harvey Kietel and Ben Kingsley help make up a star-studded cast.\n\nCalifornia Split (1974)\n\nCalifornia Split is a bit of a cult classic among gambling fans. It is a film about poker, boxing, horse racing, and just about everything a gambling man could bet on. The film received warm praise from critics, with people praising Joseph Walsh’s script, saying it provided a fascinating insight into gambling and the American Dream.\n\nEight Men Out (1988)\n\nEight Men Out is a classic movie about gambling that tells the story of the Major League Baseball Black Sox Scandal. The scandal saw eight members of the Chicago White Sox team conspire with gamblers to throw the World Series in 1919. This was seen as a dark day in the history of the MLB, and the film does an excellent job of depicting it.\n\nHard Eight (1996)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson is widely considered one of the greatest film directors in the world. His first movie, Hard Eight, still holds up when compared to some of his later classics. The film tells the story of a gambling veteran and a lost chancer in Las Vegas. Like all of Anderson’s films, it’s a tragic story masterfully told thanks to excellent direction and some brilliant performances.\n\nLet It Ride (1989) Movie\n\nLet It Ride (1989)\n\nGambling movies always tend to have a darker side, but that is not the case with 1989’s Let it Ride. The film focuses on a typically unlucky gambler who has an entire day where he wins constantly. Unfortunately, the film was panned by critics and was a huge box office flop, taking just $4m against a $19m budget. Perhaps betting on an upbeat gambling movie was not the best move.\n\nLock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)\n\nGuy Ritchie’s London-set crime caper Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is an absolute classic. The film follows a gang of young men around London as they attempt to pay back debts accumulated by one of them in a poker game against a notorious London gangster.\n\nLucky You (2007)\n\nA hugely unseen movie about poker is Lucky You from 2007. The film stars Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore and tells the story of a hot-shot poker player who needs to earn his place in the World Series. The film bombed at the box office and was poorly received by critics.\n\nMississippi Grind (2015)\n\nMississippi Grind tells the story of Ben Mendelsohn’s Gerry, a down-and-out estate agent who goes on a gambling streak with Ryan Reynold’s Curtis. The film is steeped in Southern atmosphere, bringing the spirit of casinos and gambling to life, with Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck co-directing.\n\nMolly’s Game (2017)\n\nAcademy Award-winning writer Aaron Sorkin sat in the director’s chair for the first time to bring the entrepreneur Molly Bloom’s story to life in Molly’s Game. Jennifer Chastain takes on the titular role, with the film telling the story of Bloom’s underground poker empire featuring celebrities, athletes, and the mob.\n\nOwning Mahowny (2003)\n\nThe late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman is at his best in Richard Kwietniowski’s Owning Mahowny. The film tells the story of a bank employee who uses his bank’s funds to feed a gambling addiction. It is an arresting tale of gambling addiction and was well-received by critics, despite going largely unseen by audiences.\n\nThe Color of Money (1986) Movie\n\nThe Color of Money (1986)\n\nReprising a character 25 years later can always be a little bit of a gamble, but it paid off big time for Paul Newman in The Color of Money. The movie brings his iconic character from The Hustler, “Fast Eddie” back to the screen to mentor Tom Cruise’s Vincent in the art of hustling. Under the capable directorship of Martin Scorses, the film scored Paul Newman his first ever Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe Cooler (2003)\n\nWilliam H Macy is in fine form in the Cooler. He plays ‘Bernie’ a guy whose luck is so bad that casinos pay him to sit at tables and bring everyone else’s luck down. While it is not exactly a film that is in any way realistic, it still provides plenty of entertainment, and it even earned Alec Baldwin his first-ever Academy Award nomination.\n\nUncut Gems (2019)\n\nAdam Sandler gave a career-best performance in the 2019 hit Uncut Gems. The movie focuses on a jeweller who has a bad gambling problem who needs to find a precious gem to pay off his debts. The film is an anxiety-riddled rollercoaster masterfully directed by the Safdie Brothers and boasting fantastic performances from Adam Sandler, LaKeith Stanfield, and Julia Fox.\n\nVegas Vacation (1997)\n\nThe Griswolds are one of America’s funniest families, and while Vegas Vacation is considered one of the crew’s weaker outings, there are still plenty of laughs to be had. Chevy Chase is on fire in the lead role, and fans of gambling and casinos will find plenty of amusement in his interactions with dealers and casino staff.\n\nWake in Fright (1971)\n\nWake in Fright is one of the most underappreciated gambling movies of all time. The Australian movie has become a cult classic since its release in 1971. The film tells the story of a teacher who finds himself stranded in the Australian outback, surrounded by questionable characters and slowly descending further into moral degradation. There are several gambling scenes in the movie, which, to be honest, is well worth hunting out, even if you are not a fan of gambling."
