        "text": "There are a number of casino movies out there, many of them set in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. Though gambling acts as something of a backdrop in some, there are other movies where a specific game is at the center of the story. These blackjack movies do the game justice in more ways than one.\n\n21 (2008)\n\nWe’ve all seen the GIF of Zach Galifianakis in deep thought, equations whipping around his head. That comes from this movie, based on the famed MIT Blackjack Team. A loaded cast led by Kevin Spacey shows the team’s journey from winning hundreds of thousands at Vegas casinos to its untimely downfall. With a strong romantic subplot, this one of the best blackjack-based movies ever.\n\nCroupier (1998)\n\nWhile most gambling-based movies are about the player, this one is unique since it is about a blackjack dealer. Jack Manfred is a writer who takes a croupier job just to make ends meet. He breaks casino policy, getting involved with a fellow employee despite having a girlfriend. The scene where Jack deals to his boss is one that lives on as one of the best in any blackjack movie.\n\nRain Man (1988)\n\nEven for those who have never seen the movie, Dustin Hoffman’s performance as Raymond Babbitt lives on as legend. An autistic savant with an affinity to count cards, Raymond helps deeply indebted brother Charlie take the Vegas blackjack tables by storm. This movie is littered with famous quotes, including one about Judge Wapner.\n\nThe Last Casino (2004)\n\nThe famed MIT Blackjack Team has been the subject of a few movies. Led by their professor, The Last Casino follows Professor Barnes as he puts together a team of students to pull off an epic live casino takedown. The math geniuses battle with trying to win big while battling the pressures brought on by Barnes, who fights his own demons in a compulsive gambling addiction. It’s a made for TV movie, but it certainly does not feel like one.\n\nThe Gambler (2014)"
