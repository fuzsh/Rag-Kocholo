        "text": "In “The Gambler,” a movie about a guy who’s a glutton for criminally high stakes and for punishment, a skeletonized Mark Wahlberg wears a mop of greasy hair and an abject look. In some scenes, he looks crushed and lost, like a wadded scrap of paper that fell short of the garbage bin. It soon becomes clear why. His character, Jim Bennett, hit the literary jackpot years ago with a well-received first and only published novel. Now Jim splits his time between teaching college — say hello to Professor Wahlberg — and betting and losing at gaming tables, some in underworld parlors around a Los Angeles that’s been Michael Mann-ed into a smear of throbbing color and would-be existential dread.\n\n“The Gambler” is based on the terrific lowdown and gritty 1974 movie of the same title starring James Caan. That film was beautifully directed by Karel Reisz from James Toback’s script about his experience as a gambler and college lecturer; the new one was directed by Rupert Wyatt from a screenplay by William Monahan, who also wrote Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award windfall “The Departed.” Without a script in hand, it’s tough to tell how significant a contribution a writer makes to a movie, what was retained or changed from page to screen. All that’s clear in this “Gambler” is that almost everything that makes the original so pleasurably idiosyncratic, from its daft ideas to the peekaboo bear rug spread over Mr. Caan’s often-bared chest, has been expunged from the remake.\n\nA change in name is the least of it but is symptomatic of the material’s bowdlerization. Mr. Caan’s gambler is Axel Freed and the scion of a wealthy Jewish New York family. (The name suggests that Mr. Toback was familiar with Dostoyevsky’s short autobiographical novel “The Gambler,” in which the protagonist is named Alexei.) Recast as an ethnically generic poor little rich boy, Mr. Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett lives in Los Angeles, mostly after dark in illegal gambling dens where Asian and black habitués serve as decoration. In one of the remake’s better touches, Jim and some other gamblers stroll into these joints with satchels and briefcases stuffed with cash, like salarymen purposefully marching off to work. Gambling isn’t his profession, though it is his calling, habit and love.\n\nThe story mostly involves Jim’s consuming passion with gambling and, in a quasi-Freudian move, learning to transfer that libidinous energy to a dubiously healthier object, in this case one of his young students, Amy (an underused Brie Larson). Mr. Monahan may have lifted the teacher-student liaison from Dostoyevsky’s biography and novelist’s relationship with a much younger woman. That’s moderately interesting, but it doesn’t mean anything for Amy (or Ms. Larson), who does little more than look intently at Jim when he’s jumping around the lecture hall or laying down some heavy thoughts. Ms. Larson holds your eyes and interest, but she’s as ornamental as the stick figure played by Lauren Hutton in the 1974 film."
