        "text": "What's On The Table: After a wild bachelor party in Vegas, three buddies wake up with the worst hangover, and a missing groom-to-be. With no memory of the previous night, they try to piece together a mishmash of clues left behind - including a baby and a Bengal tiger - to locate their friend, Doug. Amidst their crazy quest, they get mixed up with gangsters who claim to have Doug, but who also accuse the group of stealing $80,000 in poker chips from them. They threaten to kill Doug if their chips are not returned. Blackjack comes into play when Alan (Zach Galifianakis) uses his card counting abilities to win $82,000 in chips to save Doug. It ends up being the wrong Doug, but that's a longer story.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: Though blackjack isn't a central theme in the movie, it is the center of a hilarious scene that pokes fun at Rain Man. Swirls of imaginary mathematical equations float around Alan's head as he quietly makes his card counting calculations at the blackjack table. This is not an accurate depiction of how the system works, and it's not meant to be. It's just a joke.\n\nFun Fact: Ironically, experiencing a real hangover is impossible for lead actor Bradley Cooper - he's been sober since he was 29.\n\nWhat's On The Table: In this Oscar-winning drama, Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, an egocentric car dealer from Los Angeles. When his estranged father dies, he learns that his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) - who he had no prior knowledge of - has inherited $3 million, while Charlie has inherited nothing. Motivated by anger and greed, he travels to Ohio to kidnap Raymond from the institution he lives in, and drives him back to Los Angeles on the cross country trek of a lifetime. Though Raymond drives him crazy with his incessant chatter and redundant joke-telling, Charlie discovers he can use his brother's brilliant mind - he has a photographic memory and a knack for numbers - to his advantage. When their travels bring them to Vegas, Charlie uses Raymond to help him count cards and win big at blackjack. It's not the main plot, but the quintessential gambling scene has since been referenced in Vegas-centric films from 21 to The Hangover.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: In the famed blackjack scene, Raymond counts cards with six decks, resulting in $80,000 of winnings. Though technically the game is accurately portrayed, the likelihood that Raymond's success would be so fruitful is low - especially since he'd never played before, and received only a brief rundown from Charlie beforehand. This scene has also contributed to a misconception that having autism automatically makes someone adept at playing cards. While it makes for an entertaining scene, it's not altogether realistic.\n\nFun Fact: The scene in which Raymond farts in the phone booth while Charlie is on a call was improvised. During filming, Dustin Hoffman accidentally cut the cheese, but instead of dropping out of character, he ad-libbed. He later revered it as one of his favorite scenes of all time.\n\nWhat's On The Table: In efforts to pay off a massive gambling debt, a math professor teaches three of his brightest pupils card-counting to win big at blackjack. Since he's been banned from the Canadian casinos himself, he uses his mathematical minions to do his bidding for him, but it all comes at a price.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: Based on the MIT blackjack Team - a team of university students that card-counted their way through Vegas casinos from 1979 into the 1990s - this French-language film is a more accurate representation of the real-life events than the better-known English-language film based on the same events, 21. While the Kevin Spacey version take liberties and exaggerates - seriously, no one in real life gets beat up by Lawerence Fishburne for card-counting - The Last Casino is a truer depiction of casino culture. As most card-counting films do, it does perpetuate the misleading notions that only geniuses can count cards and that the technique guarantees big wins every time.\n\nFun Fact: Director Pierre Gill has also worked as a cinematographer or in other roles in the photography unit on many hit films, including Denis Villeneuve's hit films Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival.\n\nWhat's On The Table: After losing $30,000 in a hand of Texas hold 'em to a Russian mobster (John Malkovich), Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) folds on the gambling life to focus on law school, and his relationship with his live-in girlfriend. When his old gambling buddy, Worm (Edward Norton), resurfaces from prison and asks for help settling a gambling debt, Mike is lured off of his straight and narrow path, and back into the world of rounding.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: In Rounders, Mike McDermott is addicted to gambling, and poker is his game of choice. Not only does the film offer a realistic point of view from the eyes of a compulsive gambler, it's also one of the most accurate on-screen portrayals of poker to date. The mechanics of the game aren't compromised for the sake of the script, and the hands that the characters are dealt are believable.\n\nFun Fact: Gretchen Mol plays Matt Damon's live-in girlfriend, but the role was originally offered to Scream queen, Neve Campbell.\n\nWhat's On The Table: A group of MIT students - led by their Machiavellian math professor (Kevin Spacey) - form a team of card counters to win millions playing blackjack in Vegas. Twenty-one year old Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) joins the team, but only to earn $300,000 for his Harvard tuition, vowing to back out once he does. He wins the money, but doesn't stop playing. Corrupted by his greed, he gets caught up in the game, and risks losing everything.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: The film is based on the real exploits of the MIT blackjack team, and to the untrained eye, it looks like an authentic portrayal of card counting. According to blackjack experts, though, there are a few inaccuracies, including the misconception that card counters win every time (in reality, the strategy offers 1-2% advantage, which is significant enough to help influence winnings, but not an instant-win button). Similarly, the movie completely avoids including some of the strategy's technical components. On top of that, card counting is legal, so it's unlikely that Laurence Fishburne would pistol-whip anyone for doing it.\n\nFun Fact: In preparation for the film, the crew took some of the players from the real life MIT team to Vegas. Though they weren't allowed to play, Kevin Spacey claims that when they signaled for him to bet, he would win every time.\n\nWhat's On The Table: Tired of the cards life has dealt him, an aspiring writer (Clive Owen) takes a job as a croupier at a blackjack table. He falls deeper down the casino-shaped rabbit hole, when he meets Jani, a bewitching gambler who's down on her luck. He starts seeing her outside of working hours, and soon finds himself entangled in her scheme to rob the casino.\n\nWhy It Nails Gambling: While most films that center around gambling tend to capture casinos in a flashy, alluring light, this film does the opposite. Sidestepping the glitz and glam, Croupier depicts the casino as a dark, decrepit underworld where winning big is a far-flung fantasy rather than a nightly occurrence.\n\nFun Fact: As luck would have it, the film never got the chance to win big at the Academy Awards, because it was disqualified due to a short release in theaters in Singapore as well as one airing on Dutch television."
