        "text": "When Jennifer Wood, the managing editor of MM,\n\nasked me to come out of my self-imposed retirement from the “Home\n\nCinema” column to write an article for the 10th anniversary issue\n\nof this magazine, my first thought was, “Great! I’ll write that\n\narticle on the 10 best DVD releases of the decade or a rundown\n\nof my favorite film of each year of MovieMaker’s existence.” But\n\nthe assignment she offered was considerably less sweeping: poker\n\nmovies.\n\nWhat?\n\nAt first this seemed much too puny of a sub-genre\n\nto be worthy of a 10th anniversary column. But when I began thinking\n\nof the\n\nparallel between playing poker and publishing an independent magazine,\n\nthe idea gelled. Both pursuits involve tremendous risks of money\n\nand ego; the up-then-down rhythms of a single night of poker-playing\n\nmirror the month-to-month financial rollercoaster of putting out\n\nan indie mag. In a game of five-card draw, your winnings depend\n\non the strategy and luck of the other players, while in printing\n\na magazine you’re at the mercy of fickle advertisers and whether\n\nthe competition beat you to an exclusive story. Also, like a good\n\nrun at the tables the night before, you’re only as good as your\n\nlast issue. When you’re talking about Tim Rhys, the publisher and\n\neditor-in-chief of MM, he’s a gambler who knows when to hold ’em\n\nand who has never had to fold ’em.\n\nSo, okay… poker movies. Of course, when I really\n\nput my mind to it, I could come up with very few films that were about poker.\n\nThe 1998 release, Rounders, caught the arcane lingo of the\n\ntable, but John Dahl’s direction was clumsy and the story implausible,\n\nparticularly when the John Malkovich character so obviously gave\n\naway his bluff. And who could buy the pre-adolescent Matt Damon\n\nas a card shark?\n\nI remember a film called 5 Card Stud,\n\nwhich offered the minor shock of Dean Martin’s lily-white ass,\n\nbut very little card playing. Or am I thinking of The War Wagon and\n\nKirk Douglas’ lily-white\n\nass? Both films seemed to turn up on the ass end of drive-in double\n\nbills I attended as a kid.\n\nTombstone was of course about the infamous\n\nEarp-Clanton feud, with almost the entire cast decked out in\n\nhuge freakin’ moustaches\n\nand scarves by Versace. But Val Kilmer shines as the clean-shaven,\n\ntubercular Doc Holliday: a Latin-spouting aesthete and poker player\n\nextraordinaire. Anybody, however, who has tried to play a hand\n\nof Spit in the Ocean after their sixth Jack Daniels would scoff\n\nat the card scenes: if Holliday was really the raging drunk Kilmer\n\nportrays him to be, he wouldn’t be able to tell a full house from\n\nan Airstream trailer.\n\nLock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels contained a thin card-playing\n\nsubplot, but the movie was meretricious and dumb. There was a funny\n\npoker scene in Stranger Than Paradise, but all I can recall\n\nfrom it was the mighty bulk of the late Rockets Redglare filling\n\nup a corner of the frame.\n\nIf Holliday was really the raging drunk\n\nKilmer portrays him to be, he wouldn’t have\n\nbeen able to tell a full house from an Airstream trailer.\n\nOcean’s Eleven included a scene where Brad Pitt is teaching\n\nthe finer points of poker to a table full of young Hollywood actors\n\nplaying themselves. As with nearly everything Pitt has done in\n\nhis career, the bit would have played better had he let his movie\n\nstar guard down just a bit more.\n\nHal Ashby’s forgotten Lookin’ To Get Out could\n\njust as well be the inscription on the late director’s headstone. This\n\nragged study of two losers who con their way into a Vegas hotel\n\nis sad and scruffy and unsatisfying, but Jon Voight and Burt Young\n\nmanage to convey the self-delusional bravado of all those fringe\n\ncharacters you see wandering the city’s boulevards.\n\nMore searching on Google turned up other titles: A Big Hand\n\nfor the Little Lady. A Man Called Sledge. Run. A short\n\nscene in John Ford’s Cheyenne Autumn. And, of course, Maverick,\n\na film I’ll admit to not having watched but scanned. Both\n\nthe estimable Time Out Film Guide and the more plebian Leonard\n\nMaltin’s Movie and Video Guide placed Maverick somewhere\n\non the scale between “lackluster” and “lackadaisical.”\n\nFinally, I came upon the Web link for Lesbian\n\nStrip Poker Pictures. I’d still be surfing that one if it wasn’t for the lure of the\n\nlarge fee I’ll receive for writing this article.\n\nThere are a few films that explore the interrelationships and\n\npsychological issues of gambling, some of them memorable: California\n\nSplit, one of Robert Altman’s small but elegiac pictures from\n\nthe ’70s, features George Segal and Elliot Gould as a couple of\n\nsoup-stained-tie casino vagabonds. These are guys who’d rather\n\nuse their downtime to play Keno than to, say, wash up. There’s The\n\nGambler, with James Caan’s near-existential portrait of a man\n\naddicted to the pain-pleasure principle of winning and losing.\n\nAnd Scorsese’s overlooked masterpiece, Casino, nailed the\n\nauthentic casino atmosphere—the marathon of night, noise and lights—better\n\nthan any other film. Let It Ride featured Richard Dreyfuss\n\nas a compulsive gambler having the luckiest day of his life at\n\na Florida racetrack. This may have been one of Dreyfuss’ first\n\npost-coke addiction movies—but he was still great. Hard Eight,\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson’s first film, took a downbeat look at lowbrow\n\ngamblers in Reno.\n\nI happen to have lived in Reno for six months\n\nback in 1981. One night I came up $200 short on my apartment\n\nrent, due the next day.\n\nWith $24 dollars in my pocket, I started playing blackjack at 9:00\n\np.m. and left the tables at dawn with $260. Although it was chump\n\nchange, I’d experienced the electric surge a gambler feels when\n\nwell-placed betting morphs into a streak. That electricity is harder\n\nto capture within the architecture of a game of seven-card stud.\n\nBut for the poker aficionado, or even the casual spectator—and\n\nthere seem to be a lot of you out there, judging by the surge in\n\nESPN, Travel Channel and Bravo broadcasts of high-stakes poker\n\naction—here are a few worthy titles that due justice to the game:\n\nThe Sting (1973, George Roy Hill)\n\nThere is really only one card game in this\n\npicture, but it is the “hook” which catches the “mark,” Robert Shaw’s\n\narrogant gambler, and kicks the whole plot into gear. By the\n\ntime con artists Paul\n\nNewman, Robert Redford and their band of merry tricksters are finished,\n\nShaw is out a cool half-million. The movie is brisk and artificial.\n\nThe sets appear to be deliberately made from recycled, backlit\n\nprops and the intertitle cards that announce the plot turns—“The\n\nSet-Up”, “The Wire”—clunk up the action. But Newman and Redford\n\nare immensely likable, reminding us that buddy movies work best\n\nwhen the stars and the story are both smart and amiable. In the\n\nhigh-stakes poker game scene, Newman pretends to be a drunken buffoon\n\nwho out-cheats Shaw by switching cards on the big hand. The scene\n\nis nicely staged, but I wished it had revealed how he made the\n\nswap.\n\nHouse of Games (1987, David Mamet)\n\nA game of five-card draw also gets things going\n\nhere, and everything is revealed. That’s the fun in this mind game of a movie, a classic\n\nMamet-ian exercise in man-woman verbal and sexual jousting. Lindsay\n\nCrouse plays a best-selling author and psychologist trying to help\n\na patient who says he’ll be killed if he doesn’t pay off a gambling\n\ndebt to Mike (Joe Mantegna), a con artist who hangs out at a place\n\ncalled the House of Games. Crouse is attracted to Mike and his\n\nprofession, and she and we get a crash course in the con. Although\n\nthings end up bloody, the poker game that hooks Crouse is superb\n\ntheater.\n\nWhen Crouse sees liquid leaking out of the\n\ngun that one of the players (Ricky Jay) is using to threaten\n\nher, she realizes it’s\n\na water pistol and she’s being had. When Mantegna chides Jay for\n\nputting water in a perfectly fine replica of a real pistol, Jay\n\ndefends himself by saying, “I’m not going to threaten someone with\n\nan empty gun!” It’s lines like that one and this—“I’m from the\n\nUnited States of Kiss My Ass”—that make House of Games a\n\nliterate delight.\n\nKaleidoscope (1966, Jack Smight)\n\nSome­body on the director’s creative team discovered a new kind\n\nof kaleidoscopic camera filter and decided to make a film around\n\nit. That’s the feel of this swinging ’60s, artsy-smartsy, comedy-drama.\n\nIt teamed transatlantic hipsters Warren Beatty and Susannah York\n\nin a story about a playboy who comes up with what turns out to\n\nbe an ingenious plan to bilk a Monte Carlo casino: he breaks into\n\nthe factory that makes the playing cards and marks the photographic\n\nplates so he can “read” the decks. The cards are shipped off, he\n\nshows up at the tables and wins big. He’s caught (although we’re\n\nnot sure how) and forced by Scotland Yard to play a big stakes\n\npoker game against a narcotics smuggler using the marked cards.\n\nBut when the decks turn out to be old, unmarked ones, Beatty\n\nmust use his wits instead of deception to win. The movie is insufferable,\n\nbut it’s almost worth watching just for the big moment when the\n\ncards are revealed (a must-have staple of every poker film) and\n\nBeatty’s priceless reaction.\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid (1965, Norman Jewison)\n\nThis is the granddaddy, the Mona Lisa, le grand fromage,\n\nof poker movies. Jewison took over for Sam Peckinpah, and the movie\n\ncould use more of Sam’s anachronisms and less of Jewison’s clichéd\n\nsentimentality. But this is compensated for by the presence of\n\ntwo of the finer vixens of the New Hollywood, Ann-Margret and Tuesday\n\nWeld—two beauties who make Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow look\n\nlike anorexic game show models.\n\nThere is also fine talent behind the camera. The\n\nNew Orleans location photography by Philip H. Lathrop is first-rate,\n\nthe script is by Terry Southern and Ring Lardner Jr. and Hal Ashby—who\n\nstarted out as an editor—deftly cuts between the banal romantic\n\nscenes and the more impressive poker sequences."
