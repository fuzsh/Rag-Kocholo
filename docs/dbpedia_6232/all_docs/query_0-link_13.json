        "text": "TV film series\n\nThe Gambler is a series of five American Western television films starring Kenny Rogers as Brady Hawkes, a fictional old-west gambler. The character was inspired by Rogers' hit single \"The Gambler\".[1]\n\nThere are five movies in the series. The first four were directed by Dick Lowry while the last was directed by Jack Bender.

Along the way, Brady meets Billy Montana (Bruce Boxleitner) and the two become friends. Billy (while trying to help Brady in his quest) fancies himself as a professional poker player on his own. Although Billy makes mistakes along the way (some of these include trying to find a way to cheat or do some smooth talking), Brady makes sure that he stays on good behavior during a train ride to Yuma. The duo help Jennie Reed (Lee Purcell), a prostitute who has trouble with a train baron. At the end, Brady's son's stepfather (Clu Gulager) is confronted.\n\nKenny Rogers as The Gambler: The Adventure Continues (1983)\n\n[edit]\n\nKenny Rogers again stars as Brady Hawkes in the miniseries Kenny Rogers as The Gambler: The Adventure Continues which premiered November 28 and 29, 1983 on CBS.[2] The show was an even bigger ratings success than the first and was nominated for two Emmy Awards (sound editing and sound mixing of a limited series).[5]\n\nBilly Montana, Brady, and his son Jeremiah (now played by Charles Fields) are traveling to a gambling event in San Francisco when they encounter the vicious McCourt gang. The McCourt gang force the train to stop and they take Jeremiah hostage and demand a $1 million ransom. Brady and Billy are determined to get Jeremiah back as well as the $1 million ransom which belonged to the train boss. Brady and Billy find help in their mission and meet a female bounty hunter Kate Muldoon played by Linda Evans. Kate is the fastest female gun in the west. They form a posse together in a race to save Jeremiah.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLinda Evans as Kate Muldoon\n\nJohnny Crawford as Pete Masket\n\nCharles Fields as Jeremiah\n\nDavid Hedison as Carson\n\nBob Hoy as Juno\n\nBrion James as Reece\n\nPaul Koslo as Holt\n\nCameron Mitchell as Col.

The two-part film originally aired November 3 and 4, 1991 on NBC, making it the only one of the five \"Gambler\" TV movies which did not air on CBS. It was nominated for a Costume Design Emmy.[9]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIt's 1906 and professional gambling will be outlawed in just three weeks. Therefore, Burgundy Jones (McEntire) has just that long to get Brady Hawkes safely to San Francisco for the last poker tournament, with a very special mystery player. This is made more difficult, as Hawkes is still smarting after a hard-fought loss to another professional poker player in England, who will also be at the tournament.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film features Rogers' character running across a galaxy of old TV western stars played by the original actors, including Gene Barry as Bat Masterson, Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie, David Carradine as Kung Fu's Caine, Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford from The Rifleman, Brian Keith as The Westerner, James Drury and Doug McClure from The Virginian (Drury and McClure play thinly disguised different characters, Jim and Doug, due to rights issues for Owen Wister's character), and Paul Brinegar from Rawhide.\n\nThe characters are attending a poker game said to be in honor of \"the late Mr. Paladin\" from Have Gun â€” Will Travel. (The actor who played him, Richard Boone, had died in 1981.) The game was played at the hotel at which Paladin lived. The game's dealer is \"Hey Girl\", Paladin's friend (Lisa Lu). As each veteran character appears, a few bars from his original series' theme momentarily plays in the background.\n\nThe Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw was directed by Dick Lowry.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nKenny Rogers as Brady Hawkes\n\nRick Rossovich as Ethan Cassidy\n\nReba McEntire as Burgundy Jones\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\nClaude Akins as Theodore Roosevelt\n\nDion Anderson as Fight Promoter\n\nGene Barry as Bat Masterson\n\nBruce Boxleitner as Billy Montana\n\nPaul Brinegar as Cookie\n\nKent Broadhurst as Sailor Johnson\n\nJere Burns as Cade Dalton\n\nDavid Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine\n\nChuck Connors as Lucas McCain\n\nJohnny Crawford as Mark McCain\n\nJuliana Donald as Ruby Roy Bean (billed as Juli Donald)\n\nJames Drury as Jim\n\nLinda Evans as Kate Muldoon\n\nBrian Keith as The Westerner\n\nJack Kelly as Bart Maverick\n\nPatrick Macnee as Sir Colin\n\nDoug McClure as Doug\n\nHugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp\n\nPark Overall as Melody O'Rourke\n\nChristopher Rich as Lute Cantrell\n\nMickey Rooney as The Director (based upon D.W.

The two-part movie premiered on October 2 and October 4, 1994 on CBS.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nBrady Hawkes' son, Jeremiah (with Kris Kamm as the third actor in the role) gets involved with outlaws Butch Cassidy (Scott Paulin) and the Sundance Kid (Brett Cullen).[10] Brady tries to save him before he winds up in jail or dead.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nScott Paulin as Butch Cassidy\n\nBrett Cullen as The Sundance Kid\n\nMariska Hargitay as Etta Place\n\nKris Kamm as Jeremiah Hawkes\n\nStephen Bridgewater as Flatnose Curry\n\nRichard Riehle as Frank Dimaio\n\nNed Vaughn as Ford Hayes\n\nMartin Kove as Black Jack\n\nDixie Carter as Lillie Langtry\n\nLoni Anderson as Fanny Porter\n\nGeoffrey Lewis as Lynch\n\nUnrealized plans\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 15, 2011, Kenny Rogers told Jimmy Fallon on his television show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, that he was asked if he would want to be in another Gambler movie. He began by saying that he had a bad knee and thought it would be hard for him, but continued and said that the first scene in the movie would be a shootout. Supposedly, he would get shot in the shoulder and knee to cover his physical disabilities.[11] However, in the years that followed Rogers announced his retirement from show business and stated that his 2016 tour would be his last and after this he would be spending his time with family. Rogers later died on March 20, 2020.[12]\n\nIn other media\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nPirtle, Caleb III; Dobbs, Frank Q. (1996). Jokers Are Wild. Kenny Rogers' The Gambler. Vol. 1.
