        "text": "Anyway, so far so fantastic for Molly’s Game: an accurate depiction of a furtive and little-seen world. The other thing that was happening, exactly when it came out, was that first explosion of energy in the #MeToo movement: the accusations against Harvey Weinstein had just gone public, the hashtag was going viral on social media, and both Hollywood and the wider world were flexing a new sort of feminist muscle. As the Chimney Sweep would say, “Let’s have a Mass Debate!”\n\nIt was an exciting time to go and see a movie about a clever, ambitious, determined woman who gave up professional skiing to run an illegal poker game. Not a smiley girl-next-door who finds love when she opens her own bakery; not the brave and loyal wife of an action man; not even a wisecracking fat/black/Jewish best friend: a properly new, complicated and uncategorisable person. I remember the trailers in the cinema before Molly’s Game started were for The Post (Meryl Streep playing tough and legendary newspaper publisher Katharine Graham) and I, Tonya (Margot Robbie and Allison Janney as the controversial figure skater Tonya Harding and her terrifying mother, both characters managing to be simultaneously unsympathetic yet likable). You could hear glass ceilings cracking under the pressure of nuance. It really felt like a moment for women in entertainment.\n\nAnd then Molly Bloom got beaten up. Just as I was enjoying Jessica Chastain’s interesting performance, healthy beauty and multidimensional character: thump, crash, wallop as Molly was punched to the ground, kicked in the stomach and lay there bleeding and sobbing.\n\nThis actually happened to the real Molly Bloom, so it’s a relevant part of her story, but did it need to be shown at such length, and so visually? In an era that felt like it was looking for new ways to tell women’s stories, could they have explained any of this through sound alone, or metaphor, or anything more oblique? Will we ever get away from glossy, sexy violence?\n\nPost-beating, the on-screen Molly stripped off and had a long, hot, painful shower. Is that what you’d do? She’s been beaten up in her own home. She neither leaves to go somewhere safe, nor remains motionless and shocked on the floor. She gets up, whips her kit off and slides under the water. Let the mass debating commence.\n\nWas this a strong, honest way to show the truth of women’s lives? I don’t know. What I do know is that I was very disappointed, as a viewer in 2018, to see proud and nuanced Molly punished and humiliated in this visceral, lingering, old-school style.\n\nSo that’s the long answer. I prefer The Cincinnati Kid."
