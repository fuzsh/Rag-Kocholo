I remember that the poker in it was 5-card stud. The poker scenes did have some tension in them but let's face it - 5 card stud is at the shallow end of the poker pool.\n\nWhile it is not popular anymore, I enjoy the game because skill (bluffing and reading the other players), has a bigger role than the actual cards in your hand, compared to most any other game.\n\nQuote: Romes\n\nAs you said, Rounders.

Perhaps we could get CET to fund it, since apparently they are not very good at investing."
