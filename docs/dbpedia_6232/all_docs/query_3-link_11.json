So, this may very well be the first reference to a credit card in the movies.\n\nJust some useless trivia. (unless you hear it in final Jeopardy, then you know)\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote: billryan\n\nWith a regular AMEX card, you can charge this month but the bill is due in full at the end of the billing cycle. I refer to them as Charge cards. With their Optima cards, you can extend payments out of an extended period. These are credit cards.\n\nThirty day billing is more charge than credit, in my opinion.\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote: billryan\n\n... in 1982, AMEX sent a rep to talk to my graduating class of some two hundred. She took about an hour explaining how to use credit properly and gave numerous examples of why and when using a card was a good option. She also gave us each a thick guidebook to success in life. There was a whole section on why we should avoid drunken women and how having a wife who is an alcoholic is bad for advancing up the corporate ladder. It also recommended that we switch from beer to whiskey and mentioned that while many senior execs don't look kindly on subordinates who don't drink, many a career has been ruined by getting drunk at company functions.\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote: rxwine\n\nThe Great Sinner (1949) based on a story by Dostoevsky.\n\nGregory Peck and Ava Gardner never looked better. Ava's character and her father are degenerate gamblers and lose a lot of money. Peck is initially trying to save her from her compulsion.\n\nThe casino owner complains that he doesn't mind gamblers committing suicide but doesn't like it happening at the tables. The casino has guys walking around the casino like a human pawn shop willing to trade money for whatever valuable the patron at the table has on him. Right at the table, now that's handy.\n\nYou hear plenty of gambler fallacies about luck, wins due, etc.,\n\nPeck instead of saving her falls into the same hole. He's almost broke then has a ridiculous streak at roulette. He breaks the bank. He makes $231,750. Pretty good money for 1949. He plans to bail out the father's 200k IOUs that the casino holds.\n\nNext time he visits the roulette wheel, he's only going to stay a few minutes. Hours later...\n\nI didn't see the end of the movie.\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote: FatGeezus\n\nQuote: rxwine\n\nThe Great Sinner (1949) based on a story by Dostoevsky.\n\nGregory Peck and Ava Gardner never looked better.

Using my \"time since to time before\" talked about elsewhere here, \"Rounders\" which came out in 1998 has about he same relevance today that \"The Godfather\" did when \"Rounders\" came out.\n\nSo, what would be a good plot for a poker movie today? Not a remake or sequel to \"Rounders\" per se. I keep thinking along the lines of a few buddies who could do more with their lives but just gravitate to spending time at the poker room and sportsbook. Maybe they have another buddy who day trades.

A female behavioral scientist approaches a top level poker professional and asks for coaching on poker so that she can write scholarly papers on the behavioral psychology embodied in poker.\n\nThe audience can then follow the behavioral scientist as she is introduced to poker, learns about the game of poker, and as she gradually becomes a decent high-level player. We can see, through her eyes, the behavior of poker players - their addictions to betting against each other on weird prop bets, their cheating schemes, their ups and downs -perhaps their drug use. The behavior of poker celebrities. The huge amounts of cash that are involved in high-stakes games. The psychology of losing, of bluffing, of going on tilt, of addiction to poker.\n\nThrow in sex, personal time gambling other games in casinos, strife with family members about degrading yourself by becoming a poker player. Police seizing cash because they suspect you're a drug smuggler. An attempted theft in a casino parking garage. Then throw in even more sex.\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote: YouCanBetOnThat\n\nI would say California Split is the best gambling movie ever. However, it was directed by Robert Altman, whose style is not for everyone.\n\nI've been maintaining a list of gambling, Vegas, et al., movies at our website. I'm trying to make it as comprehensive as possible. The list doesn't include non-English language movies nor TV movies, with some exceptions.\n\nhttps://youcanbetonthat.com/movies\n\nlink to original post\n\nQuote:\n\n\"Viva Las Vegas\" is described as \"A swimming instructor (Ann-Margret) detours a singing auto racer (Elvis Presley) in town for the Grand Prix.\" and I think it is a much better movie than that description would indicate. It is often cited as being the best Elvis Presley movie (which may be weak praise) and as being very high in sexual chemistry -it was often called the best, most iconic film about Las Vegas.\n\nI love, love, love watching\n\nQuote: lilredrooster\n\n.\n\nmy personal fave scene - Casino - Ace catches a 2 man team \"spooking\" at blackjack - and deals out his personal brand of justice\n\nthe spook saw the dealer's hole card at a different table and signaled his buddy electronically as to what that hole card was\n\nbelow the clip is a link from Arnold Snyder indicating that in 1984 the Supreme Court of the State of Nevada took up a case re spooking and the article discusses its legality\n\nhttps://www.lasvegasadvisor.com/gambling-with-an-edge/is-spooking-legal/\n\n.\n\nlink to original post\n\nFrom back before the mirror was invented"
