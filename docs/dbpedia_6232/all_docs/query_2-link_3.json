        "text": "The GamblerÂ series generated five Emmy Award nominations. Rogers made his acting debut in the original filmÂ The Gambler,Â which was a massive ratings hit that achieved critical success forÂ CBSÂ upon its original release on April 8, 1980. It was nominated for two Emmy Awards.\n\nThe film is an Old West tale inspired by one of Rogersâ most beloved songs of all time. Brady Hawkes (Kenny Rogers) is a gamblinâ man who has seen it all...except for the son he never knew. When Hawkes receives a surprising letter from his child, he sets off on a journey to finally meet the boy. In the course of his travels, Hawkes crosses paths with the impetuous Billy Montana (Bruce Boxleitner -Â Tron, How The West Was Won), and the two become fast friends. Billy considers himself to be a professional gambler, but heâs got a lot to learnÂ âÂ and Hawkes has got some very familiar advice for him.Â\n\nBy popular demand, Rogers returned as Brady Hawkes inÂ The Gambler: The Adventure Continues,Â which premiered in November 1983 on CBS. The film was an even bigger ratings success than the first and was nominated for an additional two Emmy Awards.Â The Gambler Part III: The Legend ContinuesÂ followed in 1987 (also on CBS), and the Emmy-nominated fourth installment of the series,Â The Gambler Returns:Â Â The Luck Of The Draw, starring Rogers and Reba McEntire, aired on NBC in 1991. The series moved back to CBS for the 1994 finale,Â Gambler V: Playing For Keeps.Â The first four movies of the series were directed by Dick Lowry and the last was directed by Jack Bender.\n\nâThe Gambler,â written by GRAMMYÂ®-winning Country Music Hall of Fame songwriter Don Schlitz, was Kenny's fourth #1 solo hit and one of five consecutive songs by the music icon to hit No. 1 on theÂ BillboardÂ country music chart. âThe Gambler\" also went to #3 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and #16 on theÂ BillboardÂ Hot 100. It was the first #1 hit Schlitz had written. The song won a 1978 Grammy for Best Country Song and became CMAâs 1979 Song of the Year. Kenny won a 1979 Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance forÂ âThe Gambler,â and also earned CMAâs 1979 Male Vocalist of the Year. In addition, the album,Â The Gambler, won CMA honors as 1979 Album of the Year, among other accolades.Â Â\n\nIn 2018,Â âThe Gamblerâ was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being âculturally, historically, or artistically significant.â Following Kennyâs death on March 20, 2020,Â âThe Gamblerâ hit No. 1 onÂ Billboardâs Digital Song Sales chart.Â\n\nIn a career that spanned more than six decades, Kenny Rogers left an indelible mark on the history of American music.
