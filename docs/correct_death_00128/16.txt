Corazon Aquino's son, Senator Benigno Aquino III, confirmed that the former Philippine leader died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. local time Saturday (1918 GMT Friday) at the Makati Medical Center in the country's capital Manila.

"Our mother peacefully passed away at 3:18 a.m., Aug. 1, 2009, of cardio-respiratory arrest," the senator said in a statement.

"She would have wanted to thank each and every one of you for all the prayers and your continued love and support. It was her wish for all of us to pray for one another and for our country," he added.

Aquino was diagnosed with the disease in March 2008 and has been confined at the hospital for more than a month.

Previously a housewife, Aquino was pushed into politics after the assassination of her late husband, opposition senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, upon his return from exile at the Manila International Airport in 1983.
