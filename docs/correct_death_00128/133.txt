It must have been serendipity that I was in the vicinity of Makati when I heard about Cory Aquino’s Cortege passing by Ayala and Buendia en route to Manila Cathedral from La Salle Greenhills. Corazon Aquino, the beloved former president of the Philippines died of colon cancer in August 1 2009. She has been a symbol of peace and freedom for the Filipino people and well remembered for the peaceful revolution on EDSA 1986. Her death sparked deep emotions and overflowing gratitude for the gift of freedom she gave to the Filipinos.

I wasn’t really aware of the date and route of her cortege to Manila Cathedral as I rarely watch news shows or read newspapers. I’ve only learned about her where abouts online. Turning on the live coverage on tv, we could see the huge crowd that gathered in Ayala where the statue of Ninoy Aquino is located. There wasn’t much time to catch up so I decided to just meet up the procession on it’s turn to Buendia. I wasn’t really prepared for this shoot as I only have my Olympus e-520 and 25mm (50mm) f2.8 prime attached to it. But it’s better than nothing.

The streets were filled with anticipation as the people await the incoming procession. It was mid day so people from the office were able to partake in this graceful farewell as Cory’s Cortege passed by Buendia. There were people from their building balconies on watch and the crowds were excited to wave their banners and express their love and gratitude to the late president.

Confetti filled the sky and flags of both mixed images of her beloved husband Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino and hers fly through the sky. Cory’s Cortege in Ayala is like going in full circle with her husband.
