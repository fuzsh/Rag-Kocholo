        "text": "43 Judge Jimenez Street corner K-1 street, Kamuning , Quezon City -Philippines\n\nfacade of the bakery with wheat logo\n\nWe usually passed along Judge Jimenez street whenever we went to Fairview and whenever i go to Tomas Morato street in Quezon City . We used to order a couple of bread and sometimes we would also crave for their egg pies , cheese cakes, yema rolls and Pan de Rizal. The bakery had around 300 kinds of bread, cakes, pastries .\n\ninterior of the bakery\n\nThere is an air- conditioned portion where the bakery can accommodate up to 30 people at any given time.\n\nfamily photo taken during the 1950’s with a delivery trunk\n\nHistory :\n\nKamuning Bakery was founded around November 1939 a few months after the birth of Quezon City. The community bakery had witness almost all facet of the city.\n\nThe bakery is likewise intimately connected with the founding and growth of the city named after President Manuel L. Quezon.\n\nPan de Rizal\n\nOne of the family old-time recipe was the Pan de Rizal a small round shaped bread which was a luxury during the time of Rizal. According to the descendants , It was Rizal’s favorite bread, it was the one given to him by his sister when he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago. The bread was baked by their great- grandmother . The bread is common in almost every neighborhood bakeries and was called by many names. The shelf -life is longer than the ordinary bread and can last between 5 to 7 days without any refrigeration .\n\nKamuning shrub with white flowers\n\nThe area used to be planted with a lot of Kamuning shrubs ( Murraya paniculata) which are commonly found in within the locality hence the name. is used both in traditional medicine as an analgesic and for wood (for tool handles).\n\nIn the West, Murraya paniculata is cultured as an ornamental tree or hedge because of its hardiness, wide range of soil tolerance.\n\nblueberry cheesecake\n\nWe have ordered some of their home-made cakes and , this is is quite cheap at Php 65.00 per slice ! It is moist and by the time we wanted to order for take-out , it was gone !\n\nThe original owners of the bakery were Mr. Marcelo and Ms. Leticia Bonifacio, who at the time were already operating a successful bakeshop in Manila called Los Baños Bakery. The family are descendants of Lucia-Rizal-Herbosa – sister of Dr. Jose P. Rizal .\n\nKamuning bakery has been pugon-baking traditional pan de-suelo from the old family recipe of founder’s fore-bearers. Traditional old-fashioned baking with 75-year-old pugon or wood-fire brick .\n\nBiscocho -one of the bakery’s best sellers\n\nThis second bakery was one of the first structures in Kamuning, along with a barber shop, grocery, schools and a church. The bakery is pretty advance during their date, While most of the bakeries and business establishments only used ordinary lettering as their business logo, Kamuning Bakery used wheat as its logo to symbolized its primary ingredient in their breads.\n\ncheesecake\n\nJapanese Occupation\n\nOperations were rudely interrupted during the Japanese Occupation of the 1940s. Imported flour was expensive and difficult to find. In February 1945 came the Battle of Manila, with the capital city bombed by the Americans and sacked by the Japanese. The southern districts of Intramuros, Ermita and Malate went up in flames. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed, among them Leticia’s father, Miguel Bonifacio, and her husband Marcelo Javier. Some of the ingredients were very hard find , some had to be substituted with other locally available ingredients.\n\npan de suelo\n\nPan de Suelo is comparable to French baguette with their crunchy texture on the outside and soft in the inside, It is perfect combination to any pork and bean , sausages , ham or any leftover adobo or asado . It is also best for coffee or chocolate. The bakery plans to serve coffee which came from coffee plantations and farmers cooperative .\n\ncookies with glazed fruits -Php 30.00 per pack\n\nWidowed, Leticia, who was actually a lawyer, continued to run the business with her uncle Ambrosio Ison. Her bakers remained loyal to her. Helping out was Leticia’s 5-year-old son, Teddy Javier, who would sell pan de sal to customers, three pieces of which then cost five centavos.\n\npan de sal\n\nIt used to be a sleepy neighborhood with very few residents up until the late 1950’s when people began to settle the place. It was in the early 1980’s when two ( 2) television stations which are located near the bakery and its stars began patronizing the bakery.\n\negg pies\n\nMr. Teddy grew attached to the business, all the way to adolescence, college life, adulthood and employment as an ABS-CBN salesman. Eventually he resigned and took over management of the bakery. Business picked up when they were able to deliver bread to New Frontier, South Supermarket and Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in Manila.\n\ncelebrities and famous personalities are hung in a portion of a wall\n\nCelebrities and Presidents :\n\nOne of the bakery’s bestsellers is the Pan de Suelo, a favorite of President Corazon Aquino. “This kind of bread requires a special skill to bake,” . “It is cooked on the oven’s floor and the heat is circulated equally to ensure it is cooked perfectly.” Their bread is baked in a wood-fired oven, which gives the products a distinct flavor.

Quezon, Quezon City | 9 Comments »\n\nJanuary 25, 2010 marked the 77th birthday of the former Philippine President Corazon Aquino . To celebrate the event, staunch Cory supporter Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim inaugurated the first monument in the country dedicated to the former leader of the country.\n\nlocated right outside the Intramuros walls beside the statute of Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. right across the historic Manila Hotel and Luneta park . It would actually be the latest in the city’s “yellow fever craze” as some might call it, Most of the City hall employees and traffic enforcers are already wearing yellow uniform , having already named a bridge, an elementary school, a university building, and a hospital after her in a span of 5 months.\n\n77th birthday FDC commemorative stamp with second print Cory memoriam stamps\n\nNot to mentioned the not so new issue of the Philippine Postal Corporation a First Day Cover ( Cory’s 77th birthday ) with a second print of the Cory Aquino memoriam stamps . These FDC stamp is considered commemorative, since there were about 500 pieces according to the philatelic staff.\n\nTita Cory was featured in Philippine stamps for about a dozen times which included the definitive issue (Philippine Presidents ) series in early 2000.\n\nManila Cityhall officials led by the enigmatic Mayor Alfredo Lim, Ms. Gemma Cruz- Araneta , members of the Cojuangco- Aquino family , distinguished guests led the unveiling of the statue.\n\nThe monument showed the former President Cory flashing the ever-famous “Laban” or “Fight” hand sign on her right while holding the 1987 Philippine Constitution on her left which Castrillo explained was a symbolism of Cory’s legacy in restoring and upholding democratic rule in the country.\n\nSenator Benigno Aquino statute\n\nThe Cory monument was designed by renowned Filipino sculptor Eduardo Castrillo , who happens also to be the same sculptor behind the Rajah Sulayman monument, Our Lady of EDSA, the Pinaglabanan shrine monument and the Bonifacio monument beside the Manila Cityhall among many others.\n\nCory and Ninoy stickers a hot item for collectors and sympathizers\n\nAfter the unveiling ceremonies of the statue, the sea of yellow supporters and crowd sung famous EDSA songs , yellow colored balloons were flown, While street hawkers had the opportunity to sell merchandises related to the famous couple.\n\nDespite being world-famous for fighting martial law and restoring democracy in the country, The tandem of Ninoy and Cory statute seems out of place !\n\nUnder the National Historical Institute guidelines on monuments, the Rizal Monument at Luneta (Rizal Park, Manila) and the Bonifacio Monument (Caloocan City) are established as points of reference and should preferably be the focal point of a city or town center.\n\nThe NHI said if two or more monuments are present at the site, the most important monument should be given prominence at the site. It said the environment around the monument must be clean and neat and should not overshadow the dominant monument.\n\n“No new construction, demolition or modification, which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed,” the NHI added.\n\nFiled under: event, people, Place, stamps | Tagged: 77th birthday, Bonifacio Monument, event, Intramuros, Luneta Park, Manila, Mayor Alfredo Lim, NHI, people, Place, President Corazon Aquino, Rizal Monument, Senator Benigno Aquino, Stamps, yellow | Leave a comment »\n\nThe Philpost had issued last September 8 , 2009 a special commemorative memoriam stamps for the late president Corazon Cojuangco Aquino.

Kennedy , Pope John Paul II, former Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin among others.\n\nPresident Cory is a known devotee of Mother Mary. The EDSA Shrine was formally known as the Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, which is dedicated to Our Lady whom many believe miraculously interceded to oust the dictatorship in a peaceful uprising in 1986.\n\nThe Philippine Postal Corporation released a limited quantities of se-tenants postage stamps, or two pieces of stamps that are joined together but bearing different designs, in honor of the former leader.\n\nwhole sheet of President Corazon Aquino stamps\n\nPhilPost had issued a limited number of the stamps of 70,000 pieces of this new Aquino stamps will be made available to the public and collectors alike.\n\nFour-hundred pieces of first day cover (FDC) envelopes was given as a special gift to the Aquino family. A limited number will be made available for sale during the launching, strictly for those who have been invited to the affair.\n\nMenchit Ongpin, whose photograph of President Aquino was used in the stamp and University of Fine Arts professor Marco Ruben Trinos Malto II would also receive smaller versions of the stamp frame for their respective contributions in the preparation of this iconic stamp.\n\nVillanueva said that “Cory Aquino stamps will serve as a fitting tribute to her achievements before her incumbency when she led the 1986 People Power Revolution. As well as the freedom and democracy that we regained during her tenure, including fighting off several coup attempts to unseat her, must never be forgotten by all Filipinos,” he said.\n\nVillanueva is also hoping that the stamps would serve as a permanent reminder to all Filipinos, those present and future generations, of her valuable contribution to the country.\n\ncomplete set of 1992 Kabisig stamps of then President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino\n\nThis is the fifth Cory stamps issued by PhilPost. The first was when she assumed the Presidency in 1986. This is not to include the definitive issues by the Philpost in the early 2000.\n\ncomplete set of 1986 People Power stamp (mint condition)\n\nAbove – Sen.

The Philpost again reprinted another 150,000 se-tenant set or about 300,000 stamps of Cory.\n\nPhilatelists , saw the second print editions had color variations. Thus creating another market ( errors and variation)!!! The first printed edition is highly collectible since only 35,000 pieces of se-tenant pairs were issued.\n\nVery limited indeed!!!!\n\nFiled under: stamps | Tagged: 1986 People Power, Commemorative, EDSA Shrine, Marco Ruben Malto, Menchit Ongpin, people, Philatelists, President Corazon Aquino, se-tenant, stamps, Stamps | 1 Comment »"
