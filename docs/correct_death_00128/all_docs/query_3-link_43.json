        "text": "Visitors and Projects from 2020-Present\n\nExtra! Extra! Don’t Kill the Messenger – Migrating to Stay Alive (April 4-7, 2024)\n\nUncovering War: Photography, Cartography and Truth in Ukraine (January 24-31, 2024)\n\nThis grant will support a visit, by Maksym Rokhmaniiko, director of the Center for Spatial Technologies (CST), an innovative office based in Kyiv, Ukraine. CST has been carrying out detailed work on the historical geography of two overlapping and convergent atrocities in Ukraine separated by 80 years: the murder and mass burial of about a hundred thousand people at the site of Babyn Yar by the Nazis and USSR, and recently the Russian invasion of Ukraine and bombing of a TV tower at the same Babyn Yar site. The work, some of it done in collaboration with Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, involves detailed documentary research, cartography and visual representation, intended to counteract propaganda and reveal, as much as possible, the facts about the atrocities carried out first by the Nazis and later in the Russian quest to re-absorb Ukraine under Russian rule. The visit will include an illustrated public lecture about the documentation work and its meaning relative to the war in Ukraine and the disinformation that accompanies war, a workshop open to all students at UO, and a series of meetings and informal gatherings with interested faculty and students. Mr Rokhmaniiko, a Ukrainian national, has a professional architecture degree from the Kyiv National University of Engineering and Architecture and a research master’s degree in architecture, supported by a Fulbright grant, from the University of Oregon.\n\nToward the 50th Anniversary of the End of the Vietnam War: Vietnamese Americans Contending with War and Postwar Legacies (October 27-28, 2023)\n\nIn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War (April 30, 1975) this conference will explore how Vietnamese Americans contend with war and postwar legacies. Nearly fifty years ago, this day witnessed the end of the 20-year civil war in Vietnam. Although peace was restored following the deaths of 3 million Vietnamese, tragedies continued with massive waves of Vietnamese attempting to flee Vietnam. This refugee crisis, the largest in history up to then, created a diaspora of 4 million Vietnamese refugees abroad, mostly in the US. From the outside, these diasporic communities seem vibrant; yet a more careful look finds lasting physical and mental traumas, intergenerational conflicts, and fraught relationship with the host country and their former homeland. The conference is aimed at gathering academics, practitioners, and community leaders for reflections on critical issues currently facing this community as a result of war and postwar tragedies. The story of this community is relevant for similar refugee communities from war-torn countries such as Laos, Cambodia, Somalia, Syria and Afghanistan. The conference will be co-sponsored by the US Institute of Peace which has been promoting justice and reconciliation between the US and Vietnam.\n\nRethinking Territory: Global Shifts, Local Dynamics (May 2023)\n\nIn response to the changing global geopolitics ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Geography will organize an in-person conference to address global territorial conflicts, international relations, and peace. The conference will include paper presentations, keynote speakers on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its implications for European security, panel discussions on the U.S.-China trade war, and dialogues between conference attendants and UO undergraduate students. Henry Yeung, a distinguished professor from National University of Singapore, will give a public lecture on the U.S.-China Trade War and the Reterritorialization of Global Electronics. Three student mapathons events related to territorial conflicts, peace, and natural disasters will be held. Maps will be circulated through Open Street Map and UO Geography club social media. The goal is to forge richer understandings of crises brought about by territorial conflicts so that students and other members of the UO community can respond productively to these crises.\n\nTuesday, May 23 – GEOG Club Mapathon\n\nStop by 11 a.m. – 3 p.m. in Condon 207\n\nFriday, June 2 – Chips war?

Russia has launched the largest war on the continent since 1945, offering nationalist justifications for seeking to dismantle Ukraine. It has provoked a shift in Germany and other European states toward larger military spending that long seemed unimaginable. It has also created enormous pressure to accelerate change in Europe’s energy sources, plus a massive refugee crisis. Europe’s response to these classic threats to security and resources, however, has been shaped powerfully by the supranational European Union. Widely seen as weak amid many recent crises—debt, refugees, eastern European quasi-authoritarianism, Brexit, the pandemic—the EU is now reasserting itself. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has taken a leading role in the response to Russia. Brussels is setting the agenda for the energy transition, and trying to use the Ukrainian crisis to consolidate a supranational system for refugee distribution. Meanwhile a hapless post-Brexit Britain makes the EU look more appealing. Keith Darden of American University will address Russia, Ukraine, and Europe’s future. Sara Wallace Goodman of UC Irvine will address refugees, migration, and post-Brexit politics in Britain and the EU.\n\nFind event details on the University of Oregon events calendar.\n\nDirector screening of The Ice Cream Sellers, a film about the Rohingya genocide (Spring 2023)\n\nSince 2016, the Rohingya genocide has been hiding in plain sight. The UN has called the Rohingya “the world’s most persecuted people”, but due to public lack of awareness and media neglect, this widely accepted view has been amended by Al Jazeera to be “the most persecuted people you’ve never heard of.” The award will bring Sohel Rahman director of The Ice Cream Sellers, to campus. The Ice Cream Sellers is an award-winning film that provides viewers with a human-scaled point of entry into grasping the incomprehensible scale of the violence and abuse endured by the Rohingya in Myanmar, and the bleakness of their quotidien existence in the refugee camp.\n\nFind event details on the University of Oregon events calendar.\n\nCawo Abdi (2020)\n\nDr. Abdi is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Minnesota and specializes in transnational migration, human rights, gender, race, and class within the Somali Diaspora.

The Truth Commission reports in countries such as Argentina (1984), El Salvador (1993), Guatemala (1999), Chile (1991 and 2004), and Peru (2003) provide accounts of the atrocities committed by repressive regimes in these countries and in some cases identify individual and institutional culprits of human rights violations.

The second year dealt with the challenges and successes of rebuilding and how communities and cities use the reconstruction of their physical fabric as a means of healing, and of pointing the way to a peaceful future.\n\nWitnessing Holocausts: The Shoah and Genocide in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries (2005-07)\n\nThis conference was mirrored off an event hosted by the Oregon Humanities Center in 1996 titled, Ethics After the Holocaust. This project included a year-long series of events, performances, and speakers that culminated in another international conference. The underlying premise for this project was an exploration of “witnessing,” with the number of actual witnesses to the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis) rapidly dwindling. Events during the academic year that were a part of this project drew comparisons between twentieth and twenty-first century genocides and the recognition that all traumas, both past and present, can only be sustained through various modes of creative representation. Funding sponsored a variety of literary, dramatic, cinematic, artistic, architectural, and musical events that addressed aspects of the Nazi Shoah and other genocidal assaults on human communities.\n\nGlobal (Dis)Integrations: Identity Politics and Cultural Transformations in an Interconnected World (2004-05)\n\nHuman Rights for ALL (2003-04)\n\nDuring this academic year, the Savage Committee supported a multifaceted event titled, Human Rights for ALL.
