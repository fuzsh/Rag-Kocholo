        "text": "It‚Äôs never the bad things that we give up in life that makes up our story! When you give up smoking, it‚Äôs for your own good because if you don‚Äôt, it will eventually kill you. Same for alcohol, pornography, prostitution, certain addictions, or even relationships that may be toxic and draining, etc. While we praise God for the deliverance, it‚Äôs never the bad given up but the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things given up - things that we hold dear and near to our hearts that really tests our faith. Issac wasn‚Äôt just anybody that God was asking from Abraham. Isaac was Abraham‚Äôs only son whom he waited 25years for - an ANSWERED PRAYER! Could it be possible that God could be asking you to give up something you‚Äôve been praying for months if not years? Following Jesus comes with a price! Count your costs carefully. What is an ‚ÄúIsaac offering‚Äù in your life that God could be requiring of you right now? Are you willing to lay it upon the altar to be consumed so you can refined?\n\nTrump: \"I‚Äôm not supposed to be here!\" ‚ÄúThe chances of me making a perfect turn are probably one-tenth of one percent, so I'm not supposed to be here.‚Äù Donald Trump told the media after making an appearance after his attempted assassination on July 13, 2024. This picture here will go down in history as one of the most powerful political images ever! Let me just say here that we serve a God who can turn the evil intended for His purpose! The bullet fired at Trump was an eighth inch close to his ear, so close that his ear started to bleed immediately. Now I don‚Äôt know about you, but that‚Äôs not luck or chance! That was God‚Äôs divine protection over this man! Could it be that God may be protecting this man for a bigger purpose - a purpose that's beyond winning the elections!? God in Romans 9:17 speaks of Pharoah, ‚ÄúFor this purpose have I raised you up‚Ä¶‚Äù Lest we forget, the events that occurred in Egypt were very rapid ones, one after another, before God‚Äôs people were delivered. While there are a lot of conspiracy theories now surfacing about Trump‚Äôs attempted assassination, it will be interesting to see the outcome of the US Presidential elections later this year. Very interesting times ahead for sure. Dear friends, times like this call for each of us to prayerfully examine our spiritual walk. Let us not be moved by fear to get our house in order. The time, peace, and freedom we now have will shortly come to an end. How are you making use of it now? Jesus loves you dear reader, and He wants you to be saved. Even so, come Lord Jesus, come! ‚ÄúNow is the high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.‚Äù Romans 13:11\n\nSince the PNG for Christ program was hosted a few weeks ago, there was a lot of stories that surfaced with respect to events and places. While many were secondary information without verifications, I share with each of us two stories from primary sources. Our Team of the Adventist World Radio (AWR) Team were in the 3ABN studio last month reflecting on the PNG for Christ program. The following are just two that they shared and and truly hearing some of these stories is awakening. In one site as a Pastor was making appeals, not one person went to the front. The appeal went on for a few minutes longer than expected. All of sudden, in the dead silence, a white spotted dog goes right in front of the crowd and just sits there. And that‚Äôs all it took for the crowd to respond to the appeals. WOW! He(Christ) answered, ‚ÄúI tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.‚ÄùLuke 19:40. There‚Äôs another story where a New Zeland Pastor was preaching in another area and a 32-year-old man was standing on the side mocking him. The crowd both heard and saw him. After a while, the young man dropped on the ground and an ambulance was called and the young man was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The next night the entire family of this deceased young man responded to the appeal and later on invited the NZ Pastor to conduct his funeral. ‚ÄúBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.‚Äù Galatians 6:7 Many more stories are shared here. Have a listen when you can. üôÇ https://lnkd.in/gF5tbCCA\n\nAbout three years ago, God asked if I was willing to drop my career and serve His church. From a PGK35,000 salary per annum + a PGK70,000 sales commission, I submitted to a PGK340 fortnightly allowance (PGK8840 pa) working in a small make-shift of a dusty office in my local Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Port Moresby. Prior, I had just been promoted to managerial position within a couple of months into my second job. My first job after graduating from the University (UPNG) as a Business major earned me K190 for my first fortnight. That was humbling! My second job came with a client credit card which had PGK1000 topped up every month at my disposal (outside of my salary). I was knocking on the door of some of the biggest companies in PNG trying to get meetings that would land business deals. ‚ÄúCoffee chats‚Äù with Senior Managers and Executives in the ICT world became a part of my weekly calender. I was getting job offers from other companies with higher salary while sitting in on meetings representing my employer. It was a pretty comfortable life for a young graduate who was only two years into the Corporate workforce after University. My career was only starting out when God came knocking at my door in June of 2021. I consented to committing only a year to serving God full-time. The year came to an end and I found myself committing another year. The second year was tough and I was only beginning to taste the life of a missionary. I had no formal income at this point. I was living by faith and on blessings - literally (I still am)! I was well into my second year living as a full-time volunteer missionary when jobs came knocking at my door, one of which would come from a very prominent member not only of the Seventh-Day Adventist community but the country (PNG). However, by then I realised that I had lost any taste for a corporate life. My heart was in mission. I praise God for amazing parents who not only have been incredibly supportive but respectful of my decision. All the while, I had friends who were excelling in their respective careers, some furthering their studies, others getting married, starting families, travelling, etc. I remain happy for them and while I do not envy any of that, I wonder though if we‚Äôre investing all of our strengths and mental powers into things of eternal interest. Now I‚Äôm not sharing this to say that we all need to give up our careers/schools and go be ‚Äúpoor missionaries‚Äù. But may this be a kind reminder to not get too comfortable with this life and all that it offers that our view of eternity is clouded. I challenge young people to rethink mission and commit a year to it. I dare you to try God! It‚Äôs been three years since I walked away from a promising earthly career to a fruitful heavenly calling. I now work and live with a global Adventist ministry outside of my home country (I didn‚Äôt even pray for this experience and I get to live dreams I didn‚Äôt even dream of). And this is just the beginning!"
