        "text": "MANILA: Former Philippine president Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino, the reserved scion of one of Asia's most famous political families, died on Thursday. He was 61.\n\nAquino, who was in office from 2010 to 2016, was the only son of the late former president Corazon Aquino and her assassinated husband, senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, both revered for leading the struggle to restore democracy in the archipelago nation.\n\nAquino was rushed to the Capitol Medical Center in Manila early Thursday.\n\nThe cause of death was renal disease as a result of diabetes, his family said.\n\nForeign Secretary Teodoro Locsin tweeted his \"grief over the death of a sea-green incorruptible\".\n\nHe said Aquino was \"brave under armed attack, wounded in crossfire, indifferent to power and its trappings, and ruled our country with a puzzling coldness but only because he hid his feelings so well it was thought he had none\".\n\nSupreme Court Justice Marvic Leonen, who was Aquino's former peace adviser, expressed \"profound sadness\" over the former leader's death.\n\n\"I knew him to be a kind man, driven by his passion to serve our people, diligent in his duties, and with an avid and consuming curiosity about new knowledge and the world in general,\" Leonen said.\n\nAquino, who was succeeded by President Rodrigo Duterte, waged an anti-corruption campaign during a term that ushered in key economic reforms.\n\nUnusually for the conservative Catholic country, Aquino remained a bachelor throughout his life, though had relationships with a number of women.\n\n- Powerful family name -\n\nAquino was born on February 8, 1960 to one of the country's wealthiest land-owning political families.\n\nA latecomer to the presidential race in 2010, he declared his candidacy only after his mother's death from cancer the previous year had plunged the country into mourning, and demonstrated the power of the family name.\n\nHe made fighting corruption his mantra, capitalising on his family's clean reputation, and vowed to reduce the poverty afflicting a third of the population.\n\nHis administration delivered average annual economic growth of just over 6.0 percent, the highest since the 1970s, handing the country investment-grade status -- but poverty remained endemic.\n\nAquino, who earned an economics degree from the elite Ateneo de Manila University, was long mocked by opponents as a fortunately surnamed under-achiever with no administrative or business experience.\n\nThey also said he had little to show for the more-than a decade he spent as a congressman and senator.\n\nBut the chain-smoking Aquino blossomed during the election campaign into a confident public speaker and the nation's leading critic of his predecessor, Gloria Arroyo, who was arrested for corruption after she left office.\n\nThe Aquino family name was stamped into Philippine political history through tragedy.\n\nMilitary personnel shot dead \"Ninoy\" Aquino at Manila airport in 1983 as he returned from US exile to lead the democracy movement against dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe event shocked the world and ignited the non-violent \"People Power\" movement that toppled Marcos. The martyred politician's widow, Corazon, led the revolution and succeeded Marcos as president in 1986.\n\nAquino had a bullet lodged in his neck -- one of five that struck him when rebel soldiers attacked the presidential palace in 1987 in a coup attempt against his mother that killed three of his bodyguards.\n\nUnlike Duterte, Aquino put the Philippines' long-running dispute with China over competing claims to the South China Sea at the top of his foreign policy agenda.\n\nHe launched a landmark case with a UN-backed tribunal to challenge Beijing's claims to most of the sea, which ruled in favour of the Philippines.\n\nBut Beijing rejected the decision.\n\nAquino is survived by four sisters."
