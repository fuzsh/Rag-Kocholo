        "text": "During my last interview with former President Corazon Aquino in February 2009—didn’t know then it would be her last, even if I knew she was battling colon cancer—I asked the democracy icon to describe herself.\n\n“I am a simple and conservative woman. When I was President, I repeated my clothes even in public functions. When I went on a state visit to the US, I wore simple suits because I was representing a third world country. Maybe I like a good pair of shoes, but I will survive without them.”\n\nYesterday, Corazon Cojuangco Aquino would have been 91 years old. Her birth was unheralded except within her happy family and clan, but the announcement of her death on Aug. 1, 2009 was heard around the world and mourned by millions.\n\nI remember the day she first called me by my first name. I had worked in her media bureau when she was a presidential candidate, and had been her close-in reporter when she was President from 1986 to 1992. But I was just part of the layers of people who served the presidency.\n\nShe had lost weight. But otherwise, life seemed very normal. When STAR photographer Joven Cagande arrived to take her photo, Cory asked me, “Can I put lipstick on first?” It was bright pink.\n\nI asked two of her daughters, a few members of the Malacañang Press Corps of her time and one of her speechwriters to share memories of Cory that brought a smile to their face—or a chuckle in their hearts.\n\nBallsy Aquino Cruz:\n\nWhen we were blessed to meet President Mandela in Capetown, he told Pinky and me: “YOU PICKED THE RIGHT MOM!”\n\nI have many memories of my mom with her grandchildren that bring a smile to my face… like when we were in a Walmart or Target. Someone asked her: “Has anybody told you that you look like Cory Aquino?” And she replied: “I do?” And her grandchildren looked at her with questioning eyes. They couldn’t understand why she didn’t admit she was Cory until we explained we were pressed for time and that their lola wanted them to choose their toys and make them happy.\n\nViel Aquino Dee:\n\nLast week we were talking about whether we’ll have mass in Manila Memorial Park (Parañaque) for mom’s birthday. I said, “Sorry, mom, ‘di na siguro kailangan.” And to justify my decision, we recalled how mom used to say to people who would loyally attend mass at the Manila Memorial Park for dad’s (Ninoy Aquino’s) birthday and death anniversary, “Thank you for coming here year after year but you don’t have to do this for me.” With the worsening traffic, it can be an effort to drive to Manila Memorial Park.\n\nSo we’ll follow mom’s instructions, no need to have mass at the Manila Memorial Park for her birthday. We’ll pray a rosary wherever we are or attend mass in any church or even virtually. Happy birthday, mom!\n\nAna Marie Pamintuan:\n\nWhenever she sent us homecooked food at the press office.\n\nVeronica Baluyut Jimenez:\n\nI think one of President Cory’s biggest contributions to history is media freedom.\n\nI remember President Cory as being very “motherly” to the Malacañang Press Corps. She would every now and then cook something and send it to the press corps for merienda. One time, when she found out I had vertigo, she sent a sample of a medical plaster she found effective when put behind the ears to ease dizziness caused by vertigo.\n\nShe would also host baby showers for the pregnant Malacañang reporters, perhaps in appreciation for their staying up till 11:00 p.m. to cover some urgent Cabinet meetings that lasted almost till midnight or other such events, in spite of their condition.\n\nKata Innocencio:\n\nAs a newbie reporter (just a year with ABS-CBN News), I was surprised as much as honored to have been assigned to the Malacañang beat in 1987 to cover the presidency of Corazon Aquino a.k.a. Tita Cory.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my first child, she even threw a baby shower for me and Marichu Villanueva who was also pregnant with her twins at the time. I love the conversations we had during her dinners with the Malacañang press… no shop talk, very relaxed, personal, with some secrets shared. More than her impressive accomplishments also as a then newbie politician, I will remember her for her warmth, motherly treatment of everyone, even the makukulit or hostile reporters. I had not seen her raise her voice at anyone. She was very well-mannered. Very presidential. Very Tita Cory.\n\nMarichu Villanueva:\n\nThen President Aquino acquiesced to “ambush” interviews if she was comfortable (with the questions). However, given the very limited time of such chance interviews, the Malacañang Press Corps (MPC) found an ingenious way to get (her) sentiments on burning issues of the day. The MPC agreed to craft a common question that would be answerable by “yes” or “no.” And if she still ignored our single question for the day, we would interpret the answer of Mrs. Aquino through her body language. If she just smiled at us, or shrugged it off, or frowned at, or laughed at our question, that would peg the lead of our news. The funny part was she never denied any of our news the next day. Obviously, she achieved her goal to keep people guessing, especially her worst critics and political enemies. So who needs to be media-savvy?\n\nGerry Lirio:\n\nWe should remember Cory Aquino for leading the restoration of democracy, for living a very simple life; for not wanting to extend her term and for the peaceful transition of power; and for instilling decency in government.\n\nEd Lingao:\n\nSi buntis na Ichu 'yung pinanghaharang namin sa presidential limousine whenever we desperately needed to ambush interview her. Siyempre hindi makagalaw si Norie (Cory’s driver) and Cory naman would step down from the car and make kamusta Ichu’s pregnancy.\n\nNena Benigno:\n\nWhen dad (Teddy Benigno, then with Agence France Presse and later Cory’s press secretary) and I visited the Aquinos at their home in Boston in 1981, Ninoy was then working as a fellow at Harvard University. I was amused at how Cory shared that he carried on there the same way he did in Manila, forgetting that there were no maids and Cory had to do everything. “Hay, naku,” she told us, “bigla na lang iyan mag-uuuwi ng mga bisita just before lunch, without warning me, and I have to rush to prepare something for them to eat.” She said he also insisted on wearing shirts that needed to be ironed after washing. “Ayaw niya ng wash and wear.” And Cory had to iron the clothes."
