        "text": "MANILA, PHILIPPINES // Masses of mourners yelled Corazon Aquino's name as her body was escorted through rain-soaked streets to Manila Cathedral today. Tens of thousands of people left their offices, schools and homes to converge on streets, waving yellow balloons and ribbons as the late former president's flag-draped casket went by on a lorry bedecked with flowers. Yellow became a symbol of the nonviolent mass uprising that forced Ferdinand Marcos from power in 1986.\n\nManila's notorious traffic came to a standstill as drivers rolled down windows and put out their hands flashing Mrs Aquino's trademark \"L\" sign for \"laban,\" or \"fight\" in Filipino - her slogan in the campaign that toppled Mr Marcos' 20-year repressive rule. Huge banners displayed \"Thank You Corazon Aquino\" and \"You're Not Alone\" - an Aquino slogan from the 1986 revolt. The motorcade passed by a \"people power\" shrine on EDSA motorway, where hundreds of thousands of her supporters blocked Mr Marcos' tanks in 1986.\n\nAlong Ayala Avenue, where Mrs Aquino led many pro-democracy marches, employees from high rises rained yellow confetti on the crowds below. \"I have not seen a crowd like this,\" said Franklin Drilon, Mrs Aquino's former cabinet aide. \"The people here are very enthusiastic, people in sandals, people in coat and tie, young and old with babies, they're coming out waving.\" Instead of the usual stock figures, a street side neon screen at the Philippine Stock Exchange flashed Mrs Aquino's favourite nickname with her portrait and a message: \"Goodbye Cory and Thank You So Much Cory.\"\n\nThe funeral convoy briefly stopped at a monument of Mrs Aquino's assassinated husband, Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr. \"I'm looking out the window now and I see women crying,\" said her daughter Kris Aquino. \"I really just appreciate the love. Everybody's saying thank you to us for sharing my mum.\" Passing along palm tree-lined Manila Bay, her body will be moved to the Manila Cathedral to lie in state for public viewing until Wednesday's funeral.\n\nMrs Aquino died early on Saturday at a Manila hospital after a year-long battle with colon cancer. She was 76. The democracy icon rose to prominence after the 1983 assassination of her husband upon his return from US exile to challenge Mr Marcos. *AP\n\nFive famous companies founded by teens\n\nThere are numerous success stories of teen businesses that were created in college dorm rooms and other modest circumstances. Below are some of the most recognisable names in the industry:\n\nFacebook: Mark Zuckerberg and his friends started Facebook when he was a 19-year-old Harvard undergraduate.\n\nDell: When Michael Dell was an undergraduate student at Texas University in 1984, he started upgrading computers for profit. He starting working full-time on his business when he was 19. Eventually, his company became the Dell Computer Corporation and then Dell Inc.\n\nSubway: Fred DeLuca opened the first Subway restaurant when he was 17. In 1965, Mr DeLuca needed extra money for college, so he decided to open his own business. Peter Buck, a family friend, lent him $1,000 and together, they opened Peteâ€™s Super Submarines. A few years later, the company was rebranded and called Subway.\n\nMashable: In 2005, Pete Cashmore created Mashable in Scotland when he was a teenager. The site was then a technology blog. Over the next few decades, Mr Cashmore has turned Mashable into a global media company.\n\nOculus VR: Palmer Luckey founded Oculus VR in June 2012, when he was 19. In August that year, Oculus launched its Kickstarter campaign and raised more than $1 million in three days. Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion two years later.\n\nLearn more about Qasr Al Hosn\n\nThe biog\n\nName: Mohammed Imtiaz\n\nFrom: Gujranwala, Pakistan\n\nArrived in the UAE: 1976\n\nFavourite clothes to make: Suit\n\nCost of a hand-made suit: From Dh550\n\nThe biog\n\nFavourite food: Tabbouleh, greek salad and sushi\n\nFavourite TV show: That 70s Show\n\nFavourite animal: Ferrets, they are smart, sensitive, playful and loving\n\nFavourite holiday destination: Seychelles, my resolution for 2020 is to visit as many spiritual retreats and animal shelters across the world as I can\n\nName of first pet: Eddy, a Persian cat that showed up at our home\n\nFavourite dog breed: I love them all - if I had to pick Yorkshire terrier for small dogs and St Bernard's for big\n\nMost polluted cities in the Middle East\n\n1.
