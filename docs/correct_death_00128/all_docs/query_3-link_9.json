        "text": "dbo:abstract\n\nBenigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr., a former Philippine senator, was assassinated on Sunday, August 21, 1983, on the tarmac of Manila International Airport (now named Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his honor). A longtime political opponent of President Ferdinand Marcos, Aquino had just landed in his home country after three years of self-imposed exile in the United States when he was shot in the head while being escorted from an aircraft to a vehicle that was waiting to transport him to prison. Also killed was Rolando Galman, who was falsely accused of Aquino's murder. Aquino was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1967 and was critical of Marcos. He was imprisoned on trumped up charges shortly after Marcos's 1972 declaration of martial law. In 1980, he had a heart attack in prison and was allowed to leave the country two months later by Marcos' wife, Imelda. He spent the next three years in exile near Boston before deciding to return to the Philippines. Aquino's assassination is credited with transforming the opposition to the Marcos regime from a small, isolated movement into a national crusade. It is also credited with thrusting Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, into the public spotlight and her running for president in the 1986 snap election. Although Marcos was officially declared the winner of the election, widespread allegations of fraud and illegal tampering on Marcos's behalf are credited with sparking the People Power Revolution, which resulted in Marcos fleeing the country and conceding the presidency to Mrs. Aquino. Although many, including the Aquino family, maintain that Marcos ordered Aquino's assassination, this was never definitively proven. An official government investigation ordered by Marcos shortly after the assassination led to murder charges against 25 military personnel and one civilian, all of whom were acquitted by the Sandiganbayan (special court). After Marcos was ousted, another government investigation under President Corazon Aquino's administration led to a retrial of 16 military personnel, all of whom were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Sandiganbayan. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision and rejected later motions by the convicted soldiers for a retrial. One of the convicts was subsequently pardoned, three have died in prison, and the remainder had their sentences commuted at various times; the last convicts were released from prison in 2009.

Aquino, yang juga merupakan lawan politik jangka panjang Presiden Filipina Ferdinand Marcos, mendarat di tanah airnya setelah berada di pengasingan selama 3 tahun di Amerika Serikat ketika ketika dalam perjalanan dari pesawat menuju sebuah kendaraan yang menunggu untuk membawanya ke penjara. Selain itu, Rolando Galman, yang kemudian disangkutpautkan dengan pembunuhan Aquino, juga ditemukan tewas. (in)\n\nL'assassinio di Benigno Aquino Jr., ex Senatore delle Filippine, avvenne domenica 21 agosto 1983 all'Aeroporto Internazionale di Manila, Para√±aque, alle 13:00 ora locale. Benigno Aquino Jr., noto rivale politico del Presidente Ferdinand Marcos, fu ferito mortalmente da un colpo d'arma da fuoco alla nuca mentre sbarcava dall'aereo che lo riportava nelle Filippine, al ritorno da un esilio di tre anni negli Stati Uniti d'America. Oltre ad Aquino rimase ucciso il suinicoltore e fuorilegge Rolando Galman, successivamente indicato come il suo assassino dal governo filippino. (it)"
