Aquino, became part of the movement to regain democracy in 1985, Cory Aquino ran against Marcos in the snap presidential elections. Despite massive cheating in the polls in favor of Marcos, Cory was sworn in as the first female president of the Philippines through a peaceful People Power Revolution\n\n“NINOY”\n\nBenigno S. Aquino, Jr.\n\nNov. 27, 1932 – August 21, 1983\n\nReading his annihilation\n\nIn the eyes of his military escorts,\n\nHe yet followed them to certain death,\n\nAnswering his own question:\n\n“Is the Filipino worth dying for?”"
