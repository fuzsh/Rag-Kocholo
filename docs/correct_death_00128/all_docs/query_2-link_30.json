Corazon Aquino gave a speech to the U.S. Congress 7 months after becoming president of the Philippines. She recounted the oppression her family faced under the Marcos dictatorship, including the imprisonment and hunger strike of her late husband Ninoy Aquino. Cory attributed the peaceful 1986 People Power Revolution that removed Marcos to Ninoy's martyrdom. As president, Cory worked to restore democracy and the constitution, establish free elections, pursue peace with communist insurgents through political means rather than violence, and reconcile a polarized nation after the dictatorship.",
