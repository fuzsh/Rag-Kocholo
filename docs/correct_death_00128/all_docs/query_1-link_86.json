        "text": "Former Philippine president Benigno Aquino, the son of two of the South-East Asian country's democracy icons, has died after being hospitalised in Manila.\n\nThe 61-year-old was president of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016.\n\n\"It is with profound grief that, on behalf of our family, I am confirming that our brother, Benigno Noynoy Aquino III, died peacefully in his sleep,\" his family said in a statement read by Pinky Aquino Abellada, one of Mr Aquino's four surviving sisters.\n\nThey said he died at 6:30am on Thursday from renal disease caused by diabetes.\n\nThe presidential palace offered condolences to his family and asked Filipinos to pray.\n\nVice-pPresident Leni Robredo, who ran under the then Aquino-led ruling party when elected in 2016, said it was \"heartbreaking\" to hear of his death.\n\n\"He worked quietly and tirelessly for the good of everyone. He will be missed.\"\n\nKnown popularly as Noynoy, he rode a wave of public support to the presidency after the 2009 death of his mother, the revered \"people power\" leader Corazon Aquino, who was herself president from 1986 to 1992.\n\nHis namesake father, a senator who staunchly opposed the rule of strongman Ferdinand Marcos, was assassinated when he returned home from political exile in 1983.\n\nThe killing shocked the nation and helped propel Mr Marcos out of office in the 1986 People Power Revolution and ushered in his mother's presidency.\n\nAlthough a scion of a wealthy land-owning political clan in the northern Philippines, Mr Aquino had an image as an incorruptible politician who battled poverty and frowned over excesses among the country's elite families and powerful politicians.\n\nOne of his first orders that lingered throughout his presidency was to ban the use of sirens in vehicles that carried VIPs through Manila's notorious traffic jams.\n\nAs well as having a carefully crafted image as a corruption fighter, Mr Aquino won plaudits for a period of economic growth that helped dispel the Philippine's \"sick man of Asia\" reputation.\n\nFlags were flying at half mast on the senate building and at the House of Representatives in Manila on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, senator Imee Marcos, daughter of the late dictator, paid tribute to Mr Aquino for his \"kind and simple soul\", saying he would be deeply missed.\n\nMr Aquino still carried a bullet injury from a 1987 attempted military coup against his mother's administration, during which he was shot five times and three of his bodyguards were killed."
