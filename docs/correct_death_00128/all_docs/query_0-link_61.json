        "text": "Statement by Foreign Minister Stephen Smith on the death of Former President Corazon Aquino\n\nThe Australian Government and people today join the people of the Philippines in celebrating the life of former President Corazon Aquino and mourning her passing. The Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith today issued the following statement on the occasion of Mrs Aquino's funeral service:\n\n\"Mrs Aquino was a much respected figure in Australia.\n\nFollowing the assassination of her husband in 1983, Mrs Aquino will be remembered for leading the People Power Revolution in 1986 after many years of authoritarian rule in the Philippines.\n\nHer courage was vital to returning her country to constitutional democracy.\n\nMrs Aquino was the 11th President of the Philippines and Asia’s first woman President.\n\nAustralia is a long-standing friend and partner of the Philippines, and is fortunate to count among its citizens many who have come from the Philippines.\n\nOur thoughts are with Mrs Aquino’s family and the people of the Philippines as they mourn her loss.\""
