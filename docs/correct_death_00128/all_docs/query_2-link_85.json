The implementation of the project, which was divided into five phases, took place from 2007 to 2013 despite the absence of approved design standards, contract plans, agency cost estimates, detailed engineering and programs of work, among others In its May 2021 resolution, the Sandiganbayan Fifth Division ordered the continuation of the preliminary conference via videoconferencing as scheduled.\n\nGraft and falsification of public documents cases\n\nFour counts of graft and three counts of falsification of public documents were charged against the Binay father and son, in their capacities as mayor and councilor at the time of the allegations, and other former Makati officials and private individuals, over the alleged rigging of the procurement processes for the construction of the P1.3 billion Makati Science High School building in 2007\n\nAllegations include:\n\n- six phases of the Makati Science High School building construction were awarded to Hilmarc's Construction Corporation at a total net cost of P1.33 billion, without proper bidding and through the falsification of bidding documents, suppression of information to prospective bidders, and undue haste in the award of the contracts\n\n- then Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay entered into a P17.37-million consultancy contract with Infiniti Architectural Works for the design of the Makati Science High School building, also without proper bidding\n\nThe Binays denied all charges, claiming that they showed the selective prosecution of the Binays In 2018, the Sandiganbayan denied a motion to quash filed by the Binays.\n\nRecommended filing of graft cases and administrative complaint for gross neglect of duty\n\nRecommended against then-Boy Scouts of the Philippines President Binay and others over allegations of the sale of the 10,000 square meter BSP Makati property to Alphaland Makati Place, Inc. in 2011, at an allegedly grossly undervalued price of P600 million given that the property was worth at least P1.75 billion, with previous improvements worth P8.43 billion\n\nThe grant of tax exemption from capital gains tax was also obtained without a request for a Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling for the exemption, and made with manifest partiality and evident bad faith causing undue injury to the government\n\nBinay was the BSP president when they sold the property to Alphaland Makati Place Inc. There is no publicly available update on the case\n\nCharges for plunder, malversation of public funds, graft and violation of the Government Procurement Reform Act\n\nFiled by lawyer Renato Bondal against Binay, Binay Jr. and others over the conspirators’ alleged diversion, funneling and misappropriation of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees and other funds intended for the College of Nursing of the University of Makati, a local state university owned by the city\n\nAccording to Bondal, Binay privatized UMak’s College of Nursing through a joint venture with the Systems Technology Institute in 2004 without proper bidding, and that Binay and his alleged cohorts pocketed about P500 million in kickbacks through overpriced tuition and professional fees collected from the school, funneled through Philippine Healthcare Educators, Inc.\n\nBondal previously filed two plunder complaints against the Binays and other officials of Makati over the alleged overpricing of the construction of several buildings in the city\n\nBinay’s camp denied all allegations, claiming that the joint venture project and creation of PHEI were duly approved by the city council There is no publicly available update on the case"
