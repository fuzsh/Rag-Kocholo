        "text": "2. 2 Who is Corazon Aquino? ⬗ Corazon Aquino or Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco- Aquino, was born on January 25, 1933 in Tarlac, Philippines ⬗ She was enrolled in a law school in Manila where she met his husband, Benigno Aquino, Jr. ⬗ She is the 11th president and first female president of the Philippines and in Asia. ⬗ She was also dubbed as the “Mother of Democracy”. ⬗ She died on August 1, 2009.\n\n3. 3 Historical Context There was already a tension between Ferdinand Marcos and Benigno Aquino, Jr. since they became president and senator. Marcos hated Aquino for opposing him so he accused Aquino of many things including being a communist, which then lead him to start Martial Law and arresting Aquino. Aquino, through her wife, Corazon, kept on sending letters and exposing Marcos of his wrongdoings while he was away.\n\n4. 4 Historical Context Aquino was assassinated when his plane landed. People seeing this thought that Aquino’s assassination was Marcos’ move to finally eliminate him. And because of Aquino’s death, it ignite more fire to the driving force of the mass to oust Marcos in his position. So, the people chose Corazon Aquino to represent the people and oppose Marcos in a snap election, in which she won.\n\n5. 5\n\n6. About the Text 6 The text is about the Corazon Aquino’s speech before the U.S. Congress. The text contained: 1. How she and her family had felt that she lost her husband many times because of his suffering in the hands of a dictator, until his death; 2. How the death of her husband eventually became the start of revolution, and how, even so unsure, she fought alongside the people; 3. The plans she had in mind like restoring the democracy and fixing the casualties in the time of Marcos. One in which she implied huge debt that Filipinos had not received. 4. And lastly, she thanked America for being her home for 3 years when her family was living there with Ninoy and for the support the country has given to the Philippines, especially in the completion of the 1987 Constitution which she states “gives full respect to the Bill of Rights”.\n\n7. 7 The document shows what the Filipinos had gone through before. Anyone who have read and watch the entire transcript and speech could learn and have a portion of knowledge. And although, I could not really say that the author/speaker is not biased at all with her personal matters against Marcos, I could say that we have an idea on with what is going on in his time. Corazon Aquino was sad about the devastation of the oppression the Filipinos had experienced, and yet, she assured hope that democracy and freedom would be given to them again. She knows what the people demanded and act according to the situation Context Presentation and Analysis of the important Historical Information found in the document\n\n8. 8 The document is relevant to the understanding of the history of our country and our fellow Filipinos. In my part, I had learned more from what I read about her speech and the research I research about its background. It is way relevant in understanding how our fellow Filipinos react to the Martial Law and start a revolution. That Filipinos, can be brave and peaceful at the same time. And that these people know their rights and their power. It is relevant in the sense that one great thing is still possible throughout the history. That we can do the same when facing same dilemma and rise up against who holds us back. Contribution and Relevance of the Document in Understanding the Grand Narrative of Philippine History\n\n9. “ “As I came to power peacefully, so shall I keep it.” — Corazon Aquino 9\n\n11.
