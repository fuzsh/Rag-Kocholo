        "text": "2. EDSA PEOPLE POWER REVOLUTION It installed Cory Aquino in the presidency, put the Philippines in the international spotlight for overthrowing dictator through peaceful means. Functioned as the symbol of the restoration of democracy and the overthrow of the Marcos Dictatorship on 1986\n\n3. ❑Cory was easily a figure of the said revolution, as the widow of the slain Marcos oppositionist and former Senator Benigno”Ninoy” Aquino Jr. ❑Hoisted as an the antithesis of the dictator ❑Her image as a mourning, widowed housewife who had always been in the shadow of her husband and relatives and had no experience in politics was juxtaposed against Marcos’s statemanship, eloquence, charisma and cunning political skills.\n\n4. THE PEOPLE POWER REVOLUTION OF 1986\n\n5. When former senator Ninoy Aquino was shot at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport on 21 August 1983, the Marcos regime greatly suffered a crisis of legitimacy. Protests from different sectors frequented different areas in the country.\n\n6. Marcos’s credibility in the international community also suffered. Paired with the looming economic crisis. He had to do something to prove his allies in the united states that he remained to be democratically anointed leader of the country.\n\n7. Februaray 1986: SNAP ELECTION Where Corazon Aquino, the widow of the slain senator was convinced to run against Marcos. The canvassing was rigged to Marcos’s favor but the people expressed their protest against the corrupt and authoritarian government.\n\n8. She went to the United and spoke before the joint session of the U.S Congress. She began her speech with the story of her leaving the United States three years prior as a newly widowed wife of Ninoy Aquino. She then told of Ninoy’s character, conviction, and resolve in opposing the authoritarianism of Marcos. She talked of the three ttimes that they lost Ninoy including his demise on 23 August 1983. SEPTEMBER 18, 1986\n\n9. “The government sought to break him by indignities and terror. They locked him up in a tiny, nearly airless cell in a military camp in the north. They stripped him naked and held a threat of a sudden midnight execution over his head. Ninoy held up manually under all of it. I barely did as well. For forty- three days, the authorities would tell me what had happen to him. This was the first time my children and I felt we had lost him.” “When that didn’t work, they put him on trial for subversion, murder and a host of other crimes before a military commission. Ninoy challenged its authority and went on a fast. If he survived it, then he felt God intended him for another fate. We had lost him again. For nothing would hold him back from his through the end. He stopped only when it dawned on him that the government would keep his body alive after the fast had destroyed his brain. And so, with barely any life in his body, he called off the fast on the 40th day.” “And then , we lost him irrevocably and more painfully than in the past. The newszcame to us in Boston. It had to be after the three happiest years of our live stogether. But his death was my country’s resurrection and the courage and the courage and faith by which alone they could be free again. The dictator had called him a nobody. Yet, two million people threw aside their passivity and fear and escorted him to his grave.”\n\n10. “I held fats to Ninoy’s conviction that it must be by the ways of democracy. I held out for participation in the 1984 election the dictatorship called , even if I knew it would be rigged. I was warned by the lawyers of the oppositon, that I ran the grave risk legitimizing the foregone results of elections that were clearly going to be fraudulent. But I was not fighting for lawyers but for the people in whose intellegence , I had implicit faith. By the excercise of democracy even in a dictatorhip. The people vindicated me in an election shamefully marked by government thuggery and fraud. The opposition swept the elections, garnering a clear majority of the votes even if they ended up (thanks to a corrupt Commission on Elections) with barely a third of tyeh seats in Parliament. Now, I knew our power.” “Again as we restore democracy by the ways of democracy, so are we completing the constitutional structues of our new democracy under a constitution that already gives full respect to teh Bill of Rights. A jelousy independent constitutional commisision is completing its draft which will be submitted later this year to a popular referendum. When it is approved, there will be elections for both national andlocal positions. So, within about a year from a peaceful but national upheaval that overturnes a dictatorship, we shall have returned to full constitutional government.”\n\n11. “My predecessor set aside democrary to saveit from a communist insurgency that numbered less than five hundred. Unhampered by respevt for human rights he went at it with nhammer and tongs. By the time he fled, that insurgency had grown to more than sixteen thousand. I think there is a lesson here to be learned about trying to stefile a thing with a means by which it grows.” “Finally may I turn to that other slavery, our twenty- six billion dollar foreign debt. I ahve said that we shall honor it. Yet, the means by which we shall be able to do so are kept from us. Many of the conditions imposed on the previous government that stole this debt, continue to be imposed on the previous government that stole this debt, continue to be imposed on us who never benifited from it.”\n\n12. “Wherever I went in the camopaign, slum area or improverished villafge. They came to me with one cry, democracy. Not food although they clearly needed it but democracy. Not work, although they say surely wanted it but democracy. Not money, for they give what little they had to my campaign . They didn’jt expect me to work a miracle that would instantly put food into their mouths, clothes in their back, education in their children and give them work that will put dignity in their lives. But I Feel the pressing obligation to respond quickly as the leader of the people so deserving of all these things.” “Has there been a greater test of national commitment to the ideals you hold dear than that my people have gone through? You have spent many lives and much treasure to bring freedom to many lands that were reluctant to receive it. And here, you have a people who want it by themselves and need only the help to preserve it.”\n\n13. ANALYSIS OF CORY AQUINO’S SPEECH • Arguably cemented the legitimacy of the EDSA government in the international arena. • The speech talks of her family background, especially her relationship with her late husband. • She talked at lenght about Ninoy’s toil and suffering at the hands of yhe dictatorship that he resisted. • Ideology or the principles of teh new democratic government. • She was also able to draw the sharp contrast between her government and of her predecessor by expressing her commitment to a democratic constitution drafted by an independent commission."
