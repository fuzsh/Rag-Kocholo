Aquino claimed she won the February 7 presidential elections but was cheater of her victory by fraud and intimidation on the part of Marcos. The withdrawal of large sums of money from banks, and the fall in share prices on such prominent companies as the Philippines biggest food and beverage conglomerate \"San Miguel Corporation\", has led foreign investors to think twice about putting their money into the country. The situation was not helped when the Philippine Central Bank suddenly declared February 24 to be a bank holiday for no apparent reason. The Manila stock exchange also closed on that day, so halting the capital's money market and foreign exchange dealings. Former Chairman of the Philippines Economic Council and Chamber of Industries, Dr. Hilarion Henares thought the boycott which was affecting foreign investors' confidence not to mention Filipino capitalists, was only the beginning. He said that if Aquino could get the people's support, Marcos and the economy would be in serious trouble. Tension in the country heightened on February 24 after Marcos declared a state of emergency and sanctioned the use of small arms by loyalist forces to defend important positions. Marcos and his 'cronies' according to Dr. Henares owned or were involved in all the country's major businesses and export sectors. Already thousands of students have banded together to form non-violent protests outside the so called 'cronie' banks belonging to Marcos or his associates. Consumer groups have also been formed to back Cory Aquino's boycott. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) has shown concern about the amount of money that was spent funding President Marcos' re-election campaign.\n\n<strong>Source: REUTERS - MANUEL SILVA</strong>\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2015.
