        "text": "Rise: A Feminist Book Project for Ages 0-18 has been promoting quality feminist literature for young readers since 2002 as a part of the Feminist Task Force and the Social Responsibilities Round Table. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the booklist.\n\nSilence is a present danger. As the pandemic rages on, politicians, school boards, and other forces strive to control the narrative by weaponizing history. By limiting access to books by marginalized creators, silencing voices of dissent, and shutting down critical discussion, institutions of power are holding us back from understanding the full range of human experience. We unequivocally stand against hatred, extremist dogma, and attempts to ban books.\n\n\"When we go back and retrieve our past, our legacy of resistance through impossible odds, our way out of no way, we redress the void of origin that would erase us. We empower and bring joy to our present.\" (Hall, Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts)\n\n\"Speaking proper will help us belong / somewhere that has never made us feel welcome // even with our mouths closed.\" (Velasquez, When We Make It)\n\nFeminism seeks to uphold human dignity by embracing multiplicity. Identity is—and always has been—blurry, multifaceted, and ever evolving. The stories we tell about ourselves and the stories we share with young people are varied, important, and often uncomfortable. Stories show us where we come from, give context for who we are, and allow us to imagine an equitable future. We provide young people with books that reflect this complicated reality.\n\n\"She is doing the thing that…so many others have done for years and years—trying to glimpse a far-off place she can’t yet see, keeping herself above water, in a world that has changed, but not enough.\" (Caletti, One Great Lie)\n\nThe books on the 2022 Rise list are beacons of light in a moment of uncertainty. Their stories offer hope for young people. These books invite engagement; pulling readers into critical conversations and allowing them to find their own stories reflected within. They are a playbook for activism.\n\n\"I am valued. I am loved. I have purpose, hope, and power. Ahead of me, sisters, aunties, mothers have opened so many doors.\" (Harris and Valdez, Ambitious Girl)\n\nFeminism is for everybody. This list welcomes all young readers to express their identities, to live their truth unapologetically, and to rise up.\n\n“Be open to challenges. Work hard and you’ll learn a lot. Listen to people. (But not the doubters!) Use your big voice to fight for your beliefs. And always remember: You deserve to be seen—and heard.” (Davids, Mays, and Pawis-Steckley, Sharice’s Big Voice)\n\nCommittee\n\nRise: A Feminist Book Project for Ages 0-18 is a project of the Feminist Task Force of the Social Responsibilities Round Table of the American Library Association. Members of the 2022 Rise: A Feminist Book Project committee are Silvia Lin Hanick (co-chair), LaGuardia Community College (CUNY), NY; Jean-Louise Zancanella (co-chair), College of Western Idaho, ID; Ally Watkins, First Regional Library, MS; Sara Saxton, Wasilla Public Library, AK; Allison Staley, Lake Oswego Public Library, OR; Mallory Caise, Lisle Library District, IL; Vicki Pietrus, Niles West High School, IL; Cynthia Medrano, Parkland College, IL; and Laura Simeon, Kirkus Reviews.\n\n2022 Rise: A Feminist Book Project List\n\nAn asterisk (*) indicates that a book is one of our Top Ten Titles.\n\nA PDF version of the entire list is available here.\n\nEarly Readers\n\nFiction\n\n*Anand, Shelly.
