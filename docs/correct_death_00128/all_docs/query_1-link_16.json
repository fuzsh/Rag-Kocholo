        "text": "(1933–2009). On Aug. 21, 1983, Benigno Aquino, a Philippine politician opposed to President Ferdinand Marcos, was assassinated as he got off an airplane in Manila. On Feb. 25, 1986, his widow, Corazon Aquino, became the first woman president of the Philippines. In so doing she ended the 20-year corrupt rule of Marcos.\n\nCorazon Cojuangco was born on Jan. 25, 1933, in Tarlac province, north of Manila. Her family was wealthy and politically active: her father and a brother were both congressmen. She attended school in Manila and in the United States in Philadelphia and New York City. She graduated from Mount St. Vincent College in New York in 1953. She met Benigno Aquino after her return to Manila.\n\nAfter their marriage she helped him to pursue his political career. He hoped to be a presidential candidate in the 1973 election, but Marcos imposed martial law in 1972 and imprisoned Aquino and many other political opponents. After eight years Aquino was released and went into voluntary exile in the United States with Corazon and their five children.\n\nAfter his death she became more active politically. When Marcos called an election for February 1986, she announced her candidacy. Although results of the election were disputed, Marcos was driven from the country on Feb. 25, 1986, and she assumed the presidency. She immediately released political prisoners and made overtures to Communist revolutionaries. In the 1992 presidential election Aquino supported retired general Fidel Ramos, her secretary of defense, who had supported her through seven coup attempts. Ramos won the presidency. Aquino died Aug. 1, 2009, at Makati Medical Center in Makati, a suburb of Manila."
