        "text": "MANILA (KHNL) - According to the Associated Press, former Philippines president Corazon Aquino, who swept away a dictator with a \"people power\" revolt and then sustained democracy by fighting off seven coup attempts in six years, died on Saturday, her son said. She was 76.\n\nIn a statement, Governor Linda Lingle said: \"President Aquino was a friend to Hawaii and it was clear from the outpouring of aloha when she visited that Hawaii's Filipino community held a strong affection for her and appreciated all that she had done for her country.\"\n\nMs. Aquino was president of the Phillipines form 1987 to 1992. She had been suffering from colon cancer.\n\nPhoto source: Wikimedia"
