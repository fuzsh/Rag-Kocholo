Corazon Aquino's son, Senator Benigno Aquino III, confirmed that the former Philippine leader died of cardio respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. local time Saturday (1918 GMT Friday) at the Makati Medical Center in the country's capital Manila.

In 1986, Mrs. Aquino led the military-backed mass revolt, known as " People Power" revolution, and unseated the then president Ferdinand Marcos, putting an end to his 26-year iron-fist rule. She became the country's first female president in 1987.
