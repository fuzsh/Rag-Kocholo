        "text": "The two stands have been partially closed since December 2020 due to corrosion and asbestos damage beneath the stadium.\n\nOnce the works are completed, the Kop lower stand will accommodate an additional 3,600 fans. It will bring the total capacity of the St Andrew’s stadium to almost 30,000.\n\nThe club said that more than 50% of its subcontractors live in and around Birmingham.\n\nManaging director of property (UK & Europe) at Mace Consult, Dan Easthope, said: “Over the coming weeks, Mace will be drawing on our global expertise in stadium and venue delivery, working closely with Birmingham City Football Club and all of the suppliers currently supporting the project to ensure that the remaining work can continue with the minimum of disruption.\n\n“Although the circumstances are unfortunate, we’re pleased that Birmingham City have put their faith in us. We’re confident that we have the right team in place to deliver the outstanding work in a timely manner and ensure that as many fans as possible will be able to support the club at St Andrew’s this autumn.”"
