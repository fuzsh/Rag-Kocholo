        "text": "Sadler Alfred\n\n1880-81 to 1883-84 Right-wing\n\nDebut 16 October 1880 St George's Rangers (Away)\n\nA very fast runner who was a good dribbler of the ball. Scored a hat-trick (some reports state that the second goal was scored by Goldthorpe) in Macclesfield's first ever entry into the FA Cup against Lockwood Brothers of Sheffield who won the match 4-3. Also appeared regularly on the score sheet in competitive matches and represented Cheshire at County level.\n\nWhen he had retired from playing tried his hand as a referee but after angering a section of the Chester crowd decided against this activity. Was appointed secretary of the club and also obtained a first class honours degree in silk manufacturing.\n\nSalmon Henry 'Harry'\n\n1927-28 Centre-half\n\nCL League 1 App 0 Goals\n\nDebut 18 February 1928 Manchester North End (Away)\n\nBorn in Fenton, first played for Stoke St Peter's and then Longton Hall.\n\nGiven a one match trial by Macclesfield in February 1928 when he was introduced into the team along with four other new players in an attempt to stem a sequence of nine consecutive matches without a win. Unfortunately the experiment did not work as Macclesfield lost 1-7 on the day.\n\nSigned for Stoke City in May 1932 initially as an amateur but signed professional forms later in the year but only made three appearances. On leaving Stoke City he played for Millwall (May 1934) where he made 28 appearances, Wellington Town (summer 1936), Southport (June 1937) making 26 appearances, and Shrewsbury Town (summer 1938).\n\nIn WW2 was initially working on ammunitions, was called up in 1940 when he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment rising to the rank of sergeant. Took part in the D-Day landings but was killed in action on 30 July 1944 at Caen, France at the age of 34 and is buried at the Fonteney-le-Pesnel War Cemetery.\n\nBorn: 14 March 1910. Died: 30 July 1944.\n\nSambrook\n\n1922-23 Outside-right\n\nCL Cups 1 App 0 Goals\n\nDebut 2 May 1923 Sandbach Ramblers (A) Challenge Cup Semi-final replay\n\nFrom Leek, this player was given a one match trial at a time when different players were filling the outside-right position.\n\nSampson Jack\n\n2014-15 to 2016-17 Forward\n\nNC League 49(15)6 Cups 8(3)2\n\nDebut 28 March 2015 sub Bristol Rovers (Home)\n\nA member of the Wigan Academy from 2006 to 2008 and the youth section at Bolton Wanderers from 2008 to 2011, Jack signed his first professional contract with Bolton in August 2011. Although he made no senior appearances for Bolton, he spent time on loan at Southend United from January to April 2012 (nine league appearances), where he made his Football League debut, and then Accrington Stanley from October to November 2012 (five appearances). Jack moved to Morecambe in June 2013 (58 appearances, five goals).\n\nWhilst at Morecambe signed a loan deal with Macclesfield Town from March to May 2015, signing permanently for the Silkmen in July 2015. Brought in to give manager John Askey an alternative option in the forward line at a time when the recognised forwards had not featured on the score sheet for several matches. Jack's two goals came in the 2-2 draw at Halifax at the beginning of April.\n\nDuring the 2015-16 season Jack featured in the majority of the matches in different roles: as sole striker in a 4-5-1 formation, in a double strike force in a 4-4-2 formation and for several matches on the left wing. Whilst only scoring four goals, all in the second half of the season, he brought other skills to his game by using his physical presence and held the ball up well. In the home match against Dover Athletic on 12 April 2016 when goalkeeper Richie Branagan was dismissed, Jack took over the gloves for the majority of the match keeping a clean sheet and was Man of the Match in recognition of his excellent performance.\n\nInvolved in the majority of matches in the first half of the 2016-17 season Jack was used both as a striker and in a wide left midfield position and scored three goals. With manager John Askey preferring a sole striker (filled by Chris Holroyd) in his formation and other players available capable of filling the left midfield position, in January 2017 Jack went out on loan to Chorley (16 appearances six goals) until the end of the 2016-17 season.\n\nReleased by Macclesfield in the summer of 2017, Jack signed for Southport where he was the Supporters' Player of the Year in 2017-18 and Manager's Player of the Year in 2018-19. Moved to AFC Fylde in October 2020 for an undisclosed fee on a one-year contract with the option of a further year at the club's behest. AFC Fylde exercised the one-year extension to Jack's contract for the 2021-22 season. Returned to Chorley in February 2022 on a permanent contract remaining with them to the 2023-24 season and continued his registration with the club in February 2024 when he signed a long-term contract.\n\nMade one appearance in 2011 for the England U19 side.\n\nBorn: 14 April 1993.\n\nSanders Frank\n\n1977-78 Defender\n\nNPL League 1(0)0\n\nDebut 24 September 1977 Morecambe (Away)\n\nThere is nothing recorded about this player.\n\nSandwith Kevin\n\n2005-06 Defender\n\nFL League 34(1)3 Cups 7(0)2\n\nDebut 6 August 2005 Leyton Orient (Away)\n\nKevin commenced his career at Carlisle as a trainee gaining his first professional contract in July 1996 (three league appearances). On leaving Carlisle moved into the Non-League scene initially signing for Telford United in July 1999\n\n(38 appearances, one goal), then Doncaster Rovers in July 2001 (12 appearances) and Halifax Town in November 2002 (51 appearances, six goals) before re-entering the Football League with Lincoln City in March 2004 (40 appearances, two goals).\n\nSigned for Macclesfield Town in the summer of 2005, Kevin immediately went into the starting line-up, but after a rather uncertain time he was rested. However, when he was re-instated in November he returned a much more determined player and was virtually ever present for the remainder of the 2005-06 season at left-back or left wing-back. He took many of Macclesfieldâs free-kicks from which he scored three goals and also netted two goals from open play, one of which, much to his delight as a left-footed player, was scored with his right foot.\n\nHaving been transfer listed during the 2005-06 season, Kevin moved to Chester City in July 2006 (54 appearances, three goals). Subsequently has played for Weymouth from July 2008 (30 appearances), Oxford United from February 2009\n\n(32 appearances, three goals), Mansfield Town from July 2010 (24 appearances, one goal), Gainsborough Trinity from August 2011 (25 appearances, one goal) and Buxton from From July 2012 (no league appearances). Having been released by Buxton he played one match for AFC Wulfrunians in 2014 after which he retired from playing football.\n\nIn January 2018 Kevin, along with Jamie Haynes, were appointed as the new management team at Ellesmere Rangers (West Midlands League Premier Division). With Jamie Haynes leaving Ellesmere Rangers, Kevin was appointed sole manager at the start of the 2018-19 season but stepped down in the summer of 2019 due to family commitments. For an unknown period Kevin was First team coach at AFC Telford. Appointed Assistant Manager at Midland League - Premier side Shifnal Town in December 2021 where he is also registered as a player. Along with the manager, Jamie Haynes, left Shifnal Town at the end of the 2022-23 season.\n\nAway from football is involved with Crossbar Coaching in and around Shrewsbury which has been established by Gavin Cowan (former Shrewsbury Town and AFC Telford United player) for the development of young people through sport across the curriculum as well as alternative sports.\n\nBorn: Workington, 30 April 1978.\n\nSang Neil\n\n1994-95\n\nConf Cups 1(0)0\n\nDebut 15 November 1994 Blakenall (Away) Staffordshire Senior Cup R2\n\nNeil was a trainee at Everton turning professional in May 1970 but failed to break into the senior side and having been released joined Torquay United in June 1991. He made 14 Football League appearances for them but was released at the end of the season when they were relegated to the former Division Three.\n\nHe returned to the North West with Runcorn and then to Macclesfield where he was a member of the reserve side making just one senior appearance. He later played for Caernarfon Town, Bangor City, Chorley and Marine.\n\nIn 1999, at the age of 26, Neil became the youngest licensed FIFA football agent. In 2005 he became the first agent ever outside the English Premier League to negotiate an Image Rights deal when Lee Trundle signed for Swansea City.\n\nBorn: 23 May 1972.\n\nSappleton Reneil St Aubin 'Ricky'\n\n2009-10 and 2010-11 Forward\n\nFL League 19(14)8 Cups 1(1)0\n\nDebut 29 August 2009 Rotherham United (Home)\n\nThe big, burly striker started his career at Queens Park Rangers in the youth section, moving to Leicester City in July 2007 at the age of 18. He made just one substitute appearance for Leicester although he has been successful in their reserve side where he was a prolific scorer. Whilst at Leicester he enjoyed loan spells at Bournemouth (August-September 2008, three league appearances, one goal), Oxford United (January- February 2009, four appearances, one goal) and AFC Telford United (seven appearances, one goal).\n\nHe joined the Silkmen in August 2009 on loan, a move which was made permanent at the end of January 2010. His season was punctuated by injury, culminating in two knee operations which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Nevertheless, he scored seven goals and, in a low scoring season, was joint top-scorer. Having recovered from injury Ricky made his first appearance of the 2010-11 season in December at Oxford when he scored a consolation goal. However, he failed to re-establish himself in the senior side and was released in the summer of 2011.\n\nOn leaving Leicester City he was without a club until he signed for Bishop's Stortford in January 2012 (46 appearances, 10 goals, moving to Billericay Town in August 2013 (66 appearances, 28 goals), then Kingstonian in July 2015\n\n(15 appearances, seven goals) and VCD Athletic in 2016 (18 appearances, 10 goals). Re-signed for Billericay Town for the 2016-17 season where he featured as a centre-half (16 appearances, two goals) and then re-signed for Kingstonian in the summer of 2017 (seven appearances, one goal). Moved to Heybridge Swifts on 26 October 2017 (10 appearances, two goals), Cheshunt in January 2018 (six appearances, two goals) and Haringey Borough in December 2018\n\n(11 appearances, one goal) returning to Cheshunt in the summer of 2019 where he remains registered as a player but has also been appointed to a coaching role.\n\nRepresented Jamaica at Youth and Under-20 levels.\n\nBorn: Kingston, Jamaica, 8 December 1989.\n\nSawyer Thomas\n\n1895-96 and 1896-97 Winger\n\n#TC League 12 Apps 5 Goals Cups 5 Apps 1 Goal\n\nDebut 21 September 1895 Everton Reserves (Home)\n\nSigned from Derby County, Sawyer featured throughout the 1895-96 season for Macclesfield but only played in the first match of the following season.

In a way, Ben made his mark almost immediately, when he was most unfortunate to be dismissed for his alleged part in the infamous Lincoln match brawl.\n\nDespite always playing with enthusiasm, having a good turn of pace and adept at finding space, Ben found it difficult to command a regular place. However, in his final season at the club, he received his just rewards and was virtually ever present in his accustomed role as a right-sided central midfielder, and even took over in goal when Tony Bullock was dismissed at Southend. Always adopting an attacking stance, Ben scored some important goals, including one against Bolton in the Worthington Cup victory.

Ben was appointed Chief Executive officer and Head of Commercial Development and Events, World Corporate Games in July 2010, a position he held until moving to MM Flowers, based in Cambridgeshire, as Head of Commercial in May 2018.\n\nBorn: Wolverhampton, 5 August 1975.\n\nSeed Rev W\n\n1880-81 to 1882-83 Forward\n\nDebut - unknown due to missing match information\n\nFrom the information available appeared fairly regularly in the 1880-81 season, a single match in the 1881-82 season and only in the opening matches of the 1882-83 season. Perhaps his lack of appearances may be due to the fact that on occasions he acted as a referee, including the final of the Macclesfield Association Silver Medal Competition in April 1882 against the Baptists. A Curate at St George's Church he is said to have been a fine footballer confirmed in his first match for the club when he scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 home win against Cocknage.
