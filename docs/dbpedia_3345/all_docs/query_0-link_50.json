Alfie Conn went close on a couple of occasions, almost grabbing a very late leveller when his shot in crowded goal-mouth was blocked by Latchford on the floor, but Spurs could not get the equaliser they were seeking.\n\nBirmingham : - D.

The score was still 1-1 at the break, but with a further brace from Chivers completing his hat-trick, Spurs took a 3-1 lead before Steve Phillips narrowed the score-line.

The lead was doubled on the half-hour when Cliff Jones headed home Terry Medwin's cross and it became 3-0 three minutes later, when Greaves got his second of the afternoon with a header after Les Allen had put the ball into the box.\n\nWith time still remaining in the first half, Stan Lynn's fierce free-kick lead to a goal for Jimmy Harris and the teams turned around at 3-1.\n\nShortly after the interval, Harris headed a second goal and with the fans now behind the home side, they grabbed an equaliser with Lynn hitting another rocket free kick and Ken Leek putting the ball into the net as the ball ran loose in the box.\n\nBirmingham City : - John Schofield, Stan Lynn, Sissons, Terry Hennessey, Smith, Beard, Hallawell, Orritt, Jimmy Harris, Ken Leek, Bertie Auld\n\nSpurs : - Brown, Baker, Henry, Blanchflower, Norman, Mackay, Wedwin, White, Les Allen, Greaves, Cliff Jones\n\nCrowd : - 46,096\n\nRef : - 19.11.1960 A 6-0 home win helped Tottenham maintain their Double season success, with Terry Dyson 2, Cliff Jones 2, John White and a Bobby Smith penalty hitting the goals that saw Spurs keep their top spot in the table.\n\nWhite opened the scoring, with Dyson and Jones making it 3-0 at the interval.

He took Ron Burgess' throw-in and dribbled along the dead-ball line, moved in-field and then slipped his shot between Merrick and the near post to put Spurs through to a semi-final against Blackpool at Villa Park.\n\nSpurs: Ditchburn, Ramsey, Withers, Brittan, Gibbins, Burgess, Walters, Bennett, Duquemin, Baily, Medley.\n\nBirmingham City : Merrick, Hall, Green, Bannister, Badham, Boyd, Stewart, Purdon, Trigg, Ferris, Wardle.\n\nCrowd : - 50,801\n\nRef : -\n\n04.03.1953 Spurs took the lead in this Sixth Round replay, but once more it ended all square.\n\nA quarter of an hour in, Len Duquemin headed Spurs into the lead from Medley's corner, but 45 minutes later, Jackie Stewart put a free-kick in for captain Len Boyd to equalise.\n\nCharlie Withers, Eddie Baily and Duquemin combined to provide Bennett with a scoring opportunity to give Spurs the lead again in the 69th minute, but back came Brum when Ray Ferris headed home Stewart's cross to take the game into extra time. No further scoring meant a second replay and with Birmingham chairman Harry Morris calling correctly for the toss, the venue choice was his and Spurs had to head to the Midlands for a third game at Wolves.\n\nSpurs: , , , , Baily, , Bennett, Duquemin, Withers, Medley.\n\nBirmingham City : Boyd (c), Ferris, Stewart.\n\nCrowd : - 59,543\n\nRef : -\n\n28.02.1953 Spurs faced Second Division Birmingham City in this Sixth Round FA Cup tie at St. Andrews.\n\nCity took the lead through Willie Wardle, who scored with a 25 yard effort, but following Gil Merrick making a good save and a header hitting the crossbar, Spurs hit back in the 75th minute, when Les Bennett headed home Les Medley's centre to earn a replay.\n\nBirmingham City : Merrick, , , , , , , ,Wardle.\n\nSpurs: Bennett, Medley.\n\nCrowd : - 52,348\n\nRef : -\n\n. .\n\nSpurs: .\n\nBirmingham City : .\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\nRef : -\n\n. .\n\nSpurs: .\n\nBirmingham City : .\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\nRef : -\n\n. .\n\nSpurs: .\n\nBirmingham City : .\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\nRef : -\n\n01.05.1948 Despite Ted Ditchburn's heroics keeping the score at 0-0, Birmingham City celebrated at the end of the match, as the point had secured them the Second Division title.\n\nOn their home ground, Birmingham captain Fred Harris was presented with the trophy by Arthur Oakley of the Football League.\n\nBirmingham City : , , , , , , , Harris, , , .\n\nSpurs: Ditchburn, , , , , , , , , , , .\n\nCrowd : - 35,569\n\nRef : -\n\n. .\n\nSpurs: .\n\nBirmingham City : .\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\nRef : -\n\n. .\n\nSpurs: .\n\nBirmingham City : .\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\nRef : -\n\n31.08.1946 Birmingham City earned a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane on the resumption of football after World War Two.\n\nCharlie Wilson-Jones gave the Blues a lead, but an equaliser for Tottenham came from George Foreman.

Two goals each from Vivian Woodward and Bert Middlemiss secured the two points for Tottenham, but there were other notable incidents in the match between Birmingham, who had lead the table for much of the season and Spurs, who had just been beaten 0-3 by West Bromwich Albion.\n\nWoodward could have grabbed a hat-trick if the crossbar had not stopped one of his shots and in an odd incident, Birmingham's Edmund Eyre got his foot stuck in the main stand railings at the edge of the pitch. With injury time building up, there was some concern that the game might be abandoned, but the match finished in fading light, even though the game kicked off five minutes early to avoid this.\n\nSpurs: , , , , , , Woodward, Woodruff, Middlemiss, .\n\nBirmingham City : , Edmund Eyre, Charles Â“BulletÂ” Jones, , , , , .\n\nCrowd : - 25,000\n\nRef. : -"
