        "text": "Birmingham City’s plans to build a new stadium have taken a step forward after owners Knighthead completed the purchase of land in the east of the city.\n\nKnighthead has bought a 48-acre site in Bordesley Park from Birmingham City Council and confirmed plans to build a new “world-class” stadium and training ground.\n\nThe “Sports Quarter” will be home to facilities for the men’s, women’s and academy sides and aims to be a “globally recognisable sporting and entertainment location”.\n\nThe land is a former motor racing park and is located less than one mile away from St Andrew’s, which has been Birmingham’s home ground since 1906.\n\nThe site had previously been the subject for a proposed 55,000-seater stadium for the football club and Warwickshire County Cricket Club as part of the Birmingham Sports Village, but this fell through in 2006.\n\nBirmingham’s training ground has been located outside of the city at the Elite Performance and Innovation Centre, the former home of Wasps rugby club, following a fire at the Wast Hill training ground in March 2023. They signed a three-year lease for the centre in December.\n\nKnighthead co-chief executive officer and club chairman, Tom Wagner said: “When we invested in Birmingham City, we made it very clear that we had an ambitious vision to transform the experience for our fans and make a positive contribution to the growth and vitality of the city of Birmingham. The acquisition of the former Wheels site is an important next step in making this a reality. It is going to transform the future of our men’s, women’s and academy teams.”\n\nThe regeneration project will also include community pitches and a commercial space to support local businesses. The club estimate it will create 3,000 new jobs.\n\nShelby Companies, a UK subsidiary of U.S.-based Knighthood Capital Management, purchased a 45.64 per cent stake in Birmingham and took full control of St Andrew’s in July 2023. NFL legend Tom Brady became a minority owner in August.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhy is Tom Brady buying into Birmingham City?\n\nBirmingham sit 22nd in the Championship in the league’s final relegation spot after a disappointing first season under Knighthead’s ownership. Manager John Eustace was sacked in October with the club sixth in the table and replaced by former England international Wayne Rooney, who was dismissed after 15 games in charge.\n\nGary Rowett was placed in interim charge in March after the club picked up just one point under assistant manager Mark Venus. He had been in temporary charge since February, with manager Tony Mowbray stepping away to undergo medical treatment.\n\nBirmingham return to action on Wednesday with the visit of Cardiff City.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe Championship relegation battle: Nine teams in danger with 10 games to go\n\n(Nathan Stirk/Getty Images)"
