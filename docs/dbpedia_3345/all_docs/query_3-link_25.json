        "text": "Birmingham City Football Club has unveiled plans to build a new ‘world class’ stadium after purchasing a 48-acre site in East Birmingham.\n\nSituated in Bordesley Park, the so-described ‘Sports Quarter’ will be home to the new venue, as well as training facilities for the Blues’ men’s, women’s and academy teams.\n\nThe development will cost between £2bn and £3bn, according to Blues Chairman Tom Wagner, and is expected to provide more than 3000 local jobs in the region.\n\nEFL Championship club Birmingham City, that has played at its St Andrew’s home for 117 years, has ambitions for a new district capable of hosting major sports events, which will feature offices and commercial spaces for local businesses.\n\nLast July, the EFL Championship club was subject to a takeover by US-based Shelby Companies Limited (SCL), a subsidiary of Knighthead Capital Management, which acquired a 45.96% ownership stake, as well as St Andrew’s.\n\nIn August, NFL icon and seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady became a minority owner of the club, joining its advisory board.\n\nTom Wagner, Birmingham City Chairman and Co-CEO of Knighthead said, “When we invested in Birmingham City, we made it very clear that we had an ambitious vision to transform the experience for our fans and make a positive contribution to the growth and vitality of the city of Birmingham.\n\n“The acquisition of the former Wheels site is an important next step in making this a reality.\n\n“The plans for the Sports Quarter will bring global interest to our Club and to Birmingham as a whole.\n\n“It is going to transform the future of our men’s, women’s and academy teams, and the fortunes of the community that we call home.\n\n“We are excited to collaborate with the fans, the local community, and key partners in Birmingham to deliver on our plans for the Sports Quarter.”"
