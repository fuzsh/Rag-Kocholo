        "text": "P:04\n\nGood afternoon and welcome back to\n\nBamber Bridge FC for this afternoonâs\n\nBarclays Womenâs Championship clash\n\nagainst Birmingham.\n\nI would also like to extend my welcome to\n\nDarren Carter and his Birmingham side that\n\nhave made the journey up to Lancashire\n\ntoday.\n\nThis afternoonâs game is our first of our three\n\nfestive fixtures at home, and we are looking to\n\nmake home advantage count. We have picked\n\nup two wins and draw in our last three home\n\ngames and we want to continue that fine form\n\nand that starts today against Birmingham.\n\nWe picked up a hard-fought 1-1 draw at\n\nhome to Southampton two weeks ago as we\n\nextended our unbeaten league run to five\n\ngames. The team had to battle in torrential\n\nconditions to earn that point against a very\n\nstrong Southampton side and was pleased\n\nwith their performance.\n\nHowever, we know that we must overcome\n\na tough Birmingham team today if we want\n\nto make it six league games unbeaten.\n\nBirmingham are full of professional quality\n\nhaving just come down from the WSL so\n\nthey have experience in abundance. Theyâve\n\nexperienced a roller-coaster start to life in the\n\nChampionship but most recently picked up an\n\nimpressive 1-0 away to Bristol City so they will\n\nbe full of confidence and looking to make it\n\nback-to-back league wins this afternoon.\n\nThank you for your support today and we\n\nlook forward to seeing you at back at Bamber\n\nBridge FC next weekend.\n\nTHE GAFFER\n\nGEMMA DONNELLY\n\nP:12\n\nFaith, how have you found life with\n\nRovers so far?\n\nTo be honest, it has gone better than I ever\n\nthought it would have. I thought it wouldâve\n\nbeen harder, but this environment allows me\n\nto make mistakes and progress. I feel like\n\nI have improved personally on and off the\n\npitch.\n\nThis is your first season in the\n\nBarclays Womenâs Championship,\n\nhow have you found it?\n\nEvery game is worth something and every\n\ngame is tough. Itâs good because you want\n\nto play against the best players, and you\n\nwant to train with them as well to help you\n\nimprove.\n\nYou have started every league game\n\nthis season so far, how does that\n\nfeel?\n\nWe caught up with summer recruit Faith Nokuthula ahead of todayâs\n\ngame as the defender reflects on her start to life as a Rover and learning\n\nfrom the teamâs environment.\n\nItâs a shock in a way. Obviously, I work hard\n\nbut to get the rewards from it is great and\n\nI wasnât expecting it. I feel valued which is\n\ngood and feel like they trust me to get the\n\njob done.\n\nHave you been learning from your\n\nteammates in the back-line?\n\nI always say to them, just talk to me. Even\n\nif itâs just to say âlook leftâ as it keeps me\n\nswitched on. Everyoneâs encouraging even\n\nif you make a mistake â itâs a very open\n\nenvironment to make mistakes and I feel like\n\nthat is the reason why Iâve improved.\n\nWhat have you made to the teamâs\n\nrecent run of form?\n\nIt is all nothing that we donât deserve. Behind\n\nthe scenes we all work so hard for the games\n\nand when things go wrong itâs tough. But we\n\ndidnât give up and now weâre well and we\n\nneed to keep that going."
