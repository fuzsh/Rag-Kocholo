        "text": "THE BACKGROUND\n\nFormed in 1875, Birmingham City Football Club is a professional football club based in the West Midlands. The team compete in The English Football League.\n\nSince 1906, the teams home ground has been St. Andrew’s Stadium. This stadium has a capacity of 29,409. As well as football games, it also occasionally hosts other events including rugby union, professional boxing, and music concerts.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nSt. Andrew’s Stadium has four stands, KOP, Tilton, Gil Merrick, and Main Stand. The KOP stand runs the length of the pitch, and has a high footfall on match days. This entrance also has a main reception and is used by clients and visitors on non-match days.\n\nThe existing entrance matting at the KOP reception was coming to the end of its life, meaning it was no longer effective at capturing moisture or dirt. Therefore, the team at Birmingham City Football Club were looking to improve the effectiveness of this entrance matting, while also boosting first-impressions.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nThe wide range of floorcare products offered by phs provided a good solution for St. Andrew’s Stadium. After a consultation to understand the needs of Birmingham City Football Club, it was decided that Fitted Forma Tiles and Custom Logo Mats would be the most suitable solution.\n\nFitted Forma Tiles\n\nThe wide range of floorcare products offered by phs provided a good solution for St. Andrew’s Stadium. After a consultation to understand the needs of Birmingham City Football Club, it was decided that Fitted Forma Tiles and Custom Logo Mats would be the most suitable solution.\n\nFitted and Loose-Lay Logo mats\n\nLogo mats were also provided to create a professional atmosphere. This allowed Birmingham City Football Club to prominently, and proudly, display their club identity, while protecting floors from damage and preventing slips and trips.\n\nAll mats from phs are made with ECONYL yarn. ECONYL regenerated nylon is made by recovering nylon waste - such as fishing nets from the oceans and aquacultures, fabric scraps from mills and carpets destined for landfills.\n\nFloorcare products from phs are also professionally cleaned and managed by expert technicians. This ensures mats are always fresh and protected with no input required from the customers.\n\nThis meant Birmingham City Football Club were supplied with a practical and sustainable matting solution.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nThe entrance at Birmingham City Football Club now provides a great first impression. The cleanliness of floors has also improved, and the risk of slips and falls in wet weather conditions has decreased.\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nOur new mats installed at the entrance of the KOP reception are fantastic!\n\nFirst impressions are everything to the club, and it’s so nice to receive some outstanding feedback from customers and staff regarding our newly improved look.\n\nIt really has raised the overall standards, appearance, and\n\ncleanliness of the area. Very impressed!"
