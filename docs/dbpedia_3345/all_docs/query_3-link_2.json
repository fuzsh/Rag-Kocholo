        "text": "Plymouth -> Birmingham! When arriving at Birmingham there are a few car parks around but I used street parking for the second time going. It seems a bit risky leaving your car on the streets of Birmingham but it has been okay the last two times leaving it. Around the ground, there is not a lot to do but if you are a keen shopper you have 4-5 shops around. When arriving at the ground it has been refurbished on the outside making it look quite nice. Inside the ground, there are currently limited seats on the bottom tier due to new seats getting fitted. The ground is a great size and the away end is behind the goal which is always great. The home atmosphere was okay but seen better.\n\nI went to St. Andrews yesterday for the first time with my 8-year-old son.\n\nWe’re out of town from South Devon and while my wife and daughters went to a concert, the boys went to the footy.\n\nWe had a great afternoon . The stewards we encountered were all extremely helpful and the lads at the gate were all very friendly. The ground was spotless inside . There was plenty on offer to eat and drink and the prices fair.\n\nThe surrounding fans were all friendly and mindful that there were children around although there was the odd F-bomb! It is a football crowd after all.\n\nFooty wasn’t too bad either. Just need a bit more confidence !\n\nGood luck the Blues!\n\nWant to see hundreds of grown adults dressing up as peaky blinders? We’ll come on down to St. Andrews stadium! Been a lifelong blues fan and never felt more embarrassed in my life to call this place home. Our best player (Hannibal) is a bloody loan signing, and half the stadium is basically demolished. Genuinely, coming here is the worst part of my week and the only reason I do is because I cheer on the away team for a laugh if I’m totally honest. My dad (my moms brother) is the only reason I support this team. Up the blooz\n\nToday we went to match with our team, and to buy food we went to the food stalls in stadium. It's number 15 stall inside the stadium, and the lady who is working in the kitchen wearing blue uniform is very rude with the customers. She is shouting at the customers if they order food and ask for burgers and chips, I don't know how the management is working with that people. Overall a bad experience in the food stall.\n\nWe have just enjoyed the most incredible hospitality experience ever!\n\nIt was a big part of my 50th Birthday Celebrations and as a family we hired out the Chairman’s Box for full hospitality on Good Friday- 15th April for the Birmingham v Coventry game.\n\nEverything about this day was perfect from start to finish.\n\nHarrison Taylor was an outstanding organiser. He looked after our initial booking and throughout from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble. He was super helpful friendly and professional.\n\nSabrina Selma El Asri was also fabulous. Her attention to detail and she was so warm and welcoming on arrival and even remembered I’d attended a spa day earlier that week and asked how it had gone. This made me feel very special and at home.\n\nIn fact Harrison, Sabrina and Lesley who was our hostess in the Chairman’s suite were all outstanding. Birmingham City Football Club should be so proud of these incredible staff. They truly went above and beyond to make this day one me and the family will never forget.\n\nThank you to you all. Now to save for the next one!\n\nThanks again\n\nLouise H"
