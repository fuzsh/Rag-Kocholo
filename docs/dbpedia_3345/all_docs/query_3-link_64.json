        "text": "BIRMINGHAM CITY have announced a new name for their stadium.\n\nThe ground, currently called St Andrew's, will now get a new name thanks to a multi-million pound naming agreement.\n\nThe club have announced they will be re-naming the stadium as St. Andrew's @ Knighthead Park.\n\nThe club have agreed the naming rights with their co-owners Shelby Companies Ltd, which is majority owned by Knighthead Annuity and Life Insurance company.\n\nThe company - known collectively as Knighthead - bought a controlling stake in the club last year and have now expanded their relationship with Birmingham by announcing the new deal.\n\nThe agreement will see not only the name of the stadium changed but also the training ground.\n\nThe Birmingham training ground will now be known as the \"The Knighthead Training and Academy Grounds.\"\n\nWhile the deal also includes a \"fan entertainment zone\" which will be built on club property for fans to enjoy.\n\nAll three changes are expected to be competed by the end of the current Championship season.\n\nAnd the club have announced that Kingthead Park is just the \"first step\" in a plan to built a \"sports quarter\" in the heart of Birmingham in the future.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nFans are encouraged by the partnership which will see almost £10m per year paid to the club for every full year of the deal.\n\nSome took to social media to share their opinions, with one writing: \"Birmingham City have just entered 'serious club' territory.\"\n\nA second added: \"Feels like we could become a proper comeback story.\"\n\nWhile another wrote: \"This is fantastic news. Owners on another level and us the fans, the club and the city itself are lucky to have them. Good times are coming…\"\n\nAnd a fourth posted: \"Absolutely great news somebody pinch me.\"\n\nBirmingham also announced that Knighthead would be donating £100,000 per year to the Birmingham City Football Club Foundation from the 2024/25 season onwards.\n\nThe club have seen things change massively since the original investment from the group in July last year.\n\nKnighthead's investors include NFL legend Tom Brady who has made himself known around the club and shown up to support the Blues on multiple occasions.\n\nHowever things on the pitch haven't quite been following suit.\n\nBirmingham sacked manager John Eustace earlier this season to bring in Wayne Rooney as the new gaffer.\n\nBut the former Manchester United icon's spell in charge was absolutely disastrous.\n\nRooney's side won just two of his 15 games as gaffer and the 38-year-old was sacked after just 84 days in the dugout."
