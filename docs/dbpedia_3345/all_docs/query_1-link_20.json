The 1966/67 A&BC Chewing Gum card notes 'A sure-tackling full back, Ron has been one of Tottenham's great stalwarts over the past few seasons. Has played in the half back line as well as at full back, and is unlucky not to have more than a single England cap'.

Four years later the FKS Mexico 70 album notes 'Veteran schemer of 29 with Kiev Dynamo who is making somewhat of a comeback internationally. Though he played in the 1966 World Cup was out of favour afterwards until 1969 when he played in three preliminary matches'.

Well-built and strong'. He stayed with Derby for six years, making 73 League appearances with 14 goals before a 1977 transfer to Crystal Palace.

Di Stefano also played international football with two countries in appearing first with Argentina and then with Spain'. For all of his club greatness he was never able to play in a World Cup Finals tournament, surely an unfortunate injustice to one of the best of all time.

Signed professional with Plymouth in April 1956, staying for three years as the Pilgrims worked to win the Third Division (South) Championship in 1959.

He was still playing for Villa at the time of the 1958 Munich Air Crash which killed a number of Manchester United players, but was rapidly signed by United in the wake of the disaster. Crowther was already cup-tied, but United were given special dispensation by the Football League due to their tragic and special circumstances, so he played for the Red Devils in the Cup that year. His time at Old Trafford lasted only 10 months before he moved to Chelsea, then later on to Brighton & Hove Albion. Terry Bell, ??/05/2014, aged 69 Career summary Football card image Hartlepools United (117), Reading (87), Aldershot (124).

The 1974 Barratt World Cup Stars card notes 'Jardine, the Rangers defender, is now a regular choice at right back for his country. He is such a valuable member of the side that the Scottish manager decided to move McGrain over to the left to make room for him. The Rangers man started in the Scottish cup final when his side beat Celtic and also played against England and Brazil. Must be one of the first men chosen to make the world cup trip to add to the honours he has already won since making his debut for Scotland a short time ago'. Jardine and Danny McGrain would be voted the best pair of fullbacks in the World Cup competition. He went on to make a total of 38 international appearances for his country.

The Rothmans Football League Players Records book records 'Powerfully built leader, clumsy, but effective on the ground with dynamic aerial strength, made his debut with Notts County in 1958, becoming a target of the bigger clubs very quickly. Aston Villa, in assessing goal scoring prowess rather than awkward gait, signed him in August 1963, big Tony responding with 68 goals from 127 games. Tommy Docherty saw him as the short term replacement for Peter Osgood, paying £100,000 to bring the marksman to the Bridge. Although only scoring six goals that season, Tony got the one that mattered in taking the Blues through to the losing F.A. Cup Final of 1967 against Spurs. Moved on relentlessly to club after club, who handed over tremendous transfer fees still looking for the \"golden touch\".\n\nThe 1970/71 Lyons Maid Soccer Stars card notes Tony's many transfers: 'Hateley's aggregate transfer value shot to a fabulous £377,500 when Birmingham City paid Coventry £72,500 at the beginning of the 1969/70 season. His earlier moves have taken him from Notts County to Aston Villa (£25,000), to Chelsea (£100,000), Liverpool (£100,000) and Coventry (£80,000). When Chelsea paid their six-figure fee in 1966 it was a record for a non-international player'.

Born in Mulranny, County Mayo, Ireland, Conmy began his professional career with Huddersfield in the Second Division in May 1959.

Pint-sized Bobby celebrated his 40th birthday in February 1971 but looks like going on for a long time yet. Tremendously popular with the Morton fans, he is the brains of the Cappielow attack. Picked up on a free transfer from Bury in 1969'.

In the 1970 tournament in Mexico, playing as captain, he went off, presumably injured, after 12 minutes of the first group game and didn't appear again in the tournament, which was a shame as Uruguay made it through to the semi-finals. In 1974 he played in all three group games in what was a poor tournament for Uruguay. The FKS Mexico 70 album notes that Pedro Rocha was a 'cool, strong midfield player with subtle footwork and a powerful finish'. This page lists those players who played in four or more World Cup Final tournaments. It is a list of elite players of the game.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_who_have_appeared_in_multiple_FIFA_World_Cups.

They then won a play-off 2-1 to qualify for the knockout round. In the knockout round they faced Brazil, going down 1-0 to a Pele goal - surely one of the standout performances in Welsh international football history. Williams played in every Wales game in the tournament. Elfed Morris, 04/11/2013, aged 71 Career summary Football card image Wrexham (9), Chester (167), Halifax Town (9). Began his League career with Wrexham in 1960 in the Fourth Division.

Chester enjoyed a rise over the next few seasons, but then fell away again.
