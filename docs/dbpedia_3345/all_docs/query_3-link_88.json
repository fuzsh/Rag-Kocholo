        "text": "Grayling will lead on UK PR and public affairs for the new Birmingham City FC stadium project, having won the retained account after a competitive pitch.\n\nThe agency will cover a broad media relations brief, focusing on business titles to communicate the latest investment by the football club’s owner, Knighthead Capital, as well as targeting fans via consumer and local (Birmingham) press.\n\nThe appointment comes as the investment firm, which purchased BCFC last July, has revealed plans to relocate the club by developing a ‘Sports Quarter’ in Birmingham.\n\nThe development is set to include a new multi-use stadium and high-performance training facilities, which will serve as the new home of BCFC, as well as bringing international sporting events to the region.\n\nThere is no incumbent agency for the comms account, with Grayling having been appointed to a new contract alongside Deloitte.\n\nGrayling did not disclose the value of the account, but described it as “a significant win”.\n\nThe work will be led by Grayling UK chief executive Heather Blundell, who said: “We are delighted to be working with Knighthead and Birmingham City FC to support their ambition for the development of this world-class Sports Quarter stadium.”\n\nThe agency will be working closely with Tom Wagner, co-chief executive of Knighthead and BCFC chairman.\n\nBlundell added: “Knighthead and Tom Wagner’s vision for not only the club but the city is one that we are very excited about playing a part in. This development will act as a beacon of entertainment for Blues fans, the local community and sports fans around the world.”\n\nThe development of the Sports Quarter is expected to generate over 3,000 local jobs.\n\nLast summer, American football star Tom Brady became an investor in BCFC, taking on the role of chairman of the advisory board.\n\nUS-based Knighthead Capital works with PR agency Jonesworks in the US region."
