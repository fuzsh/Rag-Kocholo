        "text": "When the Birmingham City Football Club was founded in 1875, it was an Alliance, bringing local people together who shared a passion for football.\n\nThey had common values, grounded in hard work and the importance of community. The goal was to entertain and provide support for each other, in good times and when faced by adversity.\n\nThe Blues are a club who believe in looking after one another. If you’re Blues, you’re Blues and we look after each other.\n\nAs such Birmingham City Football Club have a long history of being active in the community. At this moment in time the city is on the rise; but we know some people have their struggles. We have committed to be a cornerstone; a positive force in the local community where we operate and this has never been more important than it is today.\n\nWe are committed to helping those most in need, especially the young. We will provide training in the areas of education and skills, fitness and nutrition, all using the power of football to engage. We will also strive to make football accessible for all and use the beautiful game to teach many valuable life lessons."
