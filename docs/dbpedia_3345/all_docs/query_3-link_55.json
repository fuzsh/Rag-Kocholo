        "text": "Football is a sport that is played and loved up and down the UK.. It seems that this is no different in Birmingham. In fact, if you are a big fan of the sport, then will be delighted to learn just how many different football clubs there are in this particular area.\n\nWant to know more about the football clubs in Birmingham? Why not take a look at some of the different teams that you can find in and just outside Birmingham.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nWhen you think of Birmingham football clubs, then chances are that you will think of Birmingham City. Birmingham City FC is an old club, founded over 140 years ago in 1875. It moved into its current home St. Andrews Stadium in the Small Heath area during 1906.\n\nKnown as the Blues, this club is ranked as the 28th most successful in English Football, a rating that is based on the number of major trophies that have been won over the years. The most recent success for Birmingham City FC is a win for the League Cup in Wembley during 2011.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\n\nA well known Midlands club, West Bromich Albion are based in the West Bromwich area of the West Midlands and have played at The Hawthorns since 1900, before which they were a club that moved around and had a number of different places that they called home.\n\nSet up in 1878, this particular club was founded by a group of workers from the George Salter Springs Factory. They were short on funds and sporting retailers within their own area, which meant that they would have to walk to find the things they needed in order to play during those early days. This led to them being known as the West Bromwich Strollers before they dropped this for Albion!\n\nAston Villa\n\nAnother well known and much loved football club in the Birmingham area is Aston Villa. Set up in 1874 by the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel Cricket team, it was a way for these members of the team to play a different sport during the winter months. It only took this newly formed team 6 years to win their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup which was secured in 1880.\n\nThere have been a number of amazing players that have played for Aston Villa throughout the years and it comes as no surprise, that, despite their humble beginnings, they are a recognisable team across the UK.\n\nSolihull Moors\n\nOne of the more modern and local terms, Solihull Moors FC is a merger of the former Solihull Borough and Moor Green Football clubs. The Borough was founded in 1953 and Moor Green was formed in 1901. They were brought together during 2007, this was after the Moorlands, where Moor Green played had an arson attack during 2005, whereby for 2 years they took up a tenancy at Damson Park where Solihull played.\n\nThe two teams were merged due to both clubs not being able to secure gates that were big enough for the both of them.\n\nSo, there you have it. Some of the football teams that call Birmingham their home. Why not visit some of the grounds whilst you are in the area, and see if you can discover more about why they are so well-loved?"
