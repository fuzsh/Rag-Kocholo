The Baggies ran out easy 4-0 winners against a team who were then known as Small Heath Alliance, George Woodhall and Arthur Loach with two goals each sending the Baggies through to their first FA Cup Final.\n\nThe first league meetings between Albion and Small Heath - who had dropped Alliance from their name in 1888 - came during the 1894/95 season. The first game between the two sides came at Stoney Lane in November 1894 with Albion running out 4-1 winners. The return game at Blues' Muntz Street ground in February 1895 saw Albion complete the double over their local rivals with a 2-1 victory, Jack Taggart hitting both of the visitors' goals.\n\nAlbion's best ever league win against City came in April 1960 at St Andrews when hat-tricks from Ronnie Allen and Derek Kevan, along with an Alec Jackson strike helped the Baggies to a 7-1 win. Other big league victories against Blues over the years include 5-1 in 1926, 5-3 in 1957 and 6-0 in 1958.\n\nBlues' biggest league win against Albion is 4-0, a scoreline achieved three times - March 1948, March 1999 and December 2004. City also recorded a 5-3 victory over the Baggies in a Football League North game which was played at Villa Park due to St Andrews being shut due to bombing damage suffered during German air raids.\n\nThe two clubs have met eight times previously in FA Cup action, Albion winning six of the games, all of which came away from home.\n\nAlbion's last visit to St Andrews came in March 2011 when goals from Youssouf Mulumbu, James Morrison and Paul Scharner saw Roy Hodgson's men run out 3-1 winners in a Premier League clash.\n\nA full fixture history between the two teams can be found here\n\nMATCH HIGHLIGHTS\n\n(Click on game to view)\n\nSaturday 18 September 2010 - Albion 3-1 Birmingham City - Premier League - The Hawthorns\n\nSaturday 11 March 2006 - Birmingham City 1-1 Albion - Premier League - St Andrews\n\nSunday 6 March 2005 - Albion 2-0 Birmingham City - Premier League - St Andrews\n\nTuesday 29 January 2002 - Albion 1-0 Birmingham City - League Division One - The Hawthorns\n\nSunday 23 November 1997 - Albion 1-0 Birmingham City - League Division One - The Hawthorns\n\nSunday 16 March 1997 - Albion 2-0 Birmingham City - League Division One - St Andrews\n\nTuesday 4 February 1997 - Birmingham City 2-3 Albion - League Division One - St Andrews\n\nWednesday 20 March 1996 - Birmingham City 1-1 Albion - League Division One - St Andrews\n\nTuesday 30 January 1996 - Birmingham City 2-2 Albion (4-1 on pens) - Anglo Italian Cup - St Andrews\n\nSunday 17 September 1995 - Albion 1-0 Birmingham City - League Division One - The Hawthorns\n\nSaturday 8 February 1992 - Birmingham City 0-3 Albion - Third Division - St Andrews\n\nWednesday 30 September 1987 - Albion 3-1 Birmingham City - Second Division - The Hawthorns\n\n& Saturday 15 October 1988 - Birmingham City 1-4 Albion - Second Division - St Andrews\n\nSaturday 27 April 1968 - Albion 2-0 Birmingham City - FA Cup Semi-Final - Villa Park\n\nLAST MEETING AT ST ANDREWS\n\nBirmingham City 1-3 Albion\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\nSaturday 5th March 2011, 12:45pm\n\nBirmingham City: Foster; Carr, Johnson, Davies, Ridgewell (Murphy 80); Beausejour (Phillips 67), Fahey, Bowyer, Bentley; Jerome, Martins.

Subs not used: Myhill (gk), Cox, Tchoyi, Vela.\n\nGoalscorers: Mulumbu 47, Morrison 58, Scharner 72\n\nBooked: Scharner 52 (unsporting behaviour)\n\nReferee: Mike Jones (Chester)\n\nAttendance: 27,013 (3,153 Albion fans)\n\nA stunning 20-yard strike by James Morrison helped West Bromwich beat local rivals Birmingham to ease their Premier League relegation fears. After a quiet first half, Youssouf Mulumbu sparked the match into life when he poked in from close range. Just over a minute later, Jean Beausejour equalised for the Blues when he turned in Lee Bowyer's low cross. Morrison's left-foot drive restored the Baggies lead at St Andrews before Paul Scharner headed in the third.\n\nIt was a deserved scoreline for Roy Hodgson's team. They looked far more spritely than Birmingham, who appeared sluggish a week after their epic Carling Cup final win. However, neither team will look back at the first half with any great fondness. The only occasions on which a goalmouth was threatened came from two efforts by Birmingham's Cameron Jerome. His first was a weak shot from 20 yards that trickled past Scott Carson's left-hand upright, the former Cardiff forward then directing a stooping header wide of the same post.\n\nBut the yawn-inducing first half was soon a distant memory two minutes into the second, when Mulumbu bravely slotted in from 12 yards. Substitute Peter Odemwingie, brought on after the restart, fed Congolese midfielder Mulumbu who took a knock en route to beating Ben Foster with his shot. But the cheers of the visiting fans were short-lived - 79 seconds, to be precise. It was a simple Blues move that led to the equaliser. Full-back Stephen Carr found Bowyer and the former Newcastle midfielder delivered a precise square ball into the six-yard area for Beausejour to turn in. If that goal was admirable for its simplicity then West Bromwich's second was admirable for its audacity. Midfielder Morrison, returning to the starting XI, collected a pass from Steven Reid before pushing the ball a foot past Curtis Davies and letting fly. It was sensational strike, similar in brilliance to the one he scored against Manchester United earlier this season. Odemwingie then blazed over from eight yards after Chris Brunt's shot smacked Foster's left-hand post and landed in the Nigerian's path. But the visitors' third finally came when the dogged Scharner popped up at the far post to head in Morrison's cross from what seemed an impossible angle to wrap up a vital win.\n\nBBC Sport\n\nCURRENT CONNECTIONS\n\nGoalkeeper Ben Foster joined the Baggies on a season long loan from City in July 2011 and after a successful campaign joined the club permanently in a £4million deal in June 2012.\n\nFoster's deputy at The Hawthorns Boaz Myhill spent the 2011/12 season on loan at St Andrews.\n\nTough-tackling defender Paul Robinson spent six years at The Hawthorns making almost 250 appearances for the club before leaving for Bolton.
