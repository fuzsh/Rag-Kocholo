Begun in 1875 as the Small Heath Alliance FC, they changed their name to Small Heath FC in 1888, then to Birmingham FC in 1905, with a final name change to Birmingham City FC in 1943. They are members of the Football League Championship, which is the second tier of English league football, where they have played since 2011. Known as Bluenoses, or Blues by their fans, their home stadium is St Andrew's Ground where they have played since 1906.\n\nPete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nBirmingham City FC\n\nAt a recent match between the women's sides of Birmingham City and Leicester City recently played at the St Andrew's Ground there were official club flags used on top of the St Andrew's Ground. It is a blue flag in the ratio 1x2 similar to the seventh fan flag (below). The flag can be seen here at\n\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/birmingham-city-v-hull-city-sky-bet-championship-football-st-andrews-birmingham-uk-27-jun-2020-10692365c.\n\nZachary Harden, 18 February 2022\n\nLogos, Crests, Badges, and Patches\n\nThe Birmingham City FC team logo is widely displayed on the usual variety of souvenir items. It consists of a globe over a football, with a blue ribbon entwined around the two spheres, the whole being on a white background. On the ribbon are the words 'BIRMINGHAM CITY/FOOTBALL CLUB' and the date of its founding. The basic colors of the logo are blue and white, the globe and the football being outlined in that color with a white background, and the ribbon being a medium blue with the text in white block letters. There seems to be a wide variation in the shades of blue used on souvenirs etc, and there are even one or two items with the colors reversed.\n\nRon Lahav, 7 May 2005\n\nThere have been quite a few BCFC logo/crests used both officially and unofficially over the years since the club renamed themselves the Birmingham City Football Club in 1905.\n\nHere are a few.\n\nPete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\n1905 - early 1960s\n\n1972 to present (most used)\n\n1976 to present\n\n1992-93 (one season)\n\nCommemorating 140 Year Anniversary 2015\n\n\"The Blues \" Uniform Patch\n\nimages located by Pete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nChampionship Crest: Preview 2014/2015\n\nimage located by Pete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nBirmingham City FC\n\nBCFC Fan Flags\n\nIn their 146 years of existence The Blues have established a large fan base and their colours of blue and white decorate the stands, flags, and clothing.

They first appeared in the late 1980s and the name came from a chant of \"Zulu, Zulu\" which Manchester City Football Club fans aimed at Birmingham in 1982, due to their multicultural following. The Birmingham fans embraced the name and the Zulus, or Zulu Warriors were born. The Zulu Warriors have many members from different ethnic backgrounds. Most other hooligan firms are mostly white and contain followers of far-right organisations such as the National Front, but the Zulus seem to welcome all races. There have been violent clashes between the Zulus and other Hooligan firms such as Stoke City, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City and West Ham United. The Zulus identify themselves with flags like those below.\n\nPete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nimages by Pete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nBased on this photo and this photo.\n\nimages by Pete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nBased on this photo and this photo.\n\nZulu Protest Flag Zulu Shield\n\nimages by Pete Loeser, 13 June 2021\n\nBased on this photo.\n\nA BCFC Zulu Warrior flag perhaps protesting professional football's desire to make profits, disregarding fan and team loyalties? Perhaps also having something to do with the formation of the Premier League (EPL) and the involvement of the Barclays Bank and big advertising money?\n\nPete Loeser, 13 June 2021"
