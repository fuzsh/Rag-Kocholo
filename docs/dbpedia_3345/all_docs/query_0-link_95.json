The current list of players can be found a little further down this page and this section is broken down by the first letter of their surname.\n\nWe are keen to include as many Birmingham City footballers as possible. If you know what has happened to any former players not listed here, please do let us know - thanks.\n\nBirmingham City Memorabilia and Books\n\nIf you like this site then we would recommend that you have a look at Amazon's latest collection of Birmingham City items for sale (often at a discounted price!). Although best known for selling books, they now have expanded their range to include all sorts of goodies - you never know what you might find!\n\nAdd Your Comments\n\nWhether you are a researcher, football fan or a former player yourself, we would love to hear from you."
