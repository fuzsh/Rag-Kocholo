        "text": "The return of football and fans together this season was supposed to trigger widespread euphoria and relief.\n\nBut for Birmingham City it has mainly delivered frustration and anger at St Andrew's.\n\nA crowd of just 10,189 was allowed in for their first home Championship game of the season against Stoke as two stands were shut.\n\nIt was just a third of the ground's 29,409-capacity and another heavily restricted attendance is due on Wednesday night for Bournemouth's visit.\n\nFans have been left fuming following the closure of the Kop and Tilton stands on safety grounds 20 months ago when corrosion in the steelworks was identified.\n\nSupporters' patience has since been stretched to breaking point after issues exposed in December 2020 by an annual council safety inspection.\n\nAs games were behind closed doors at the time, it had little impact and Far East owners Birmingham Sports Holdings were quoted £2million-3m to fix the stands during the pandemic before fans returned.\n\nYet many supporters, desperate to see Lee Bowyer's side for the first time, are now having to ballot for tickets.\n\nIt has been a sorry saga even boss Bowyer, in charge since March, admits has left him: “very disappointed”.\n\nBut such is the scale and importance of the repairs, full re-opening of both tiers of the two stands could still be months away.\n\nFurther delays seem inevitable since then CEO Xuandong Ren initially delayed work to look in vain into potentially claiming on insurance or suing the builders Taylor Woodrow.\n\nMirror Sport also understands Ren told worried colleagues not to panic as the club may yet build a new stadium.\n\nBut all those options seem either deluded or extremely long shots, not least as the stands were opened nearly 30 years ago in 1994 under then owners David Sullivan and David Gold.\n\nAstonishingly, rubble and debris under the stands, known as spoil, still remains from the original build which has masked issues in the lower tiers and proved a sting in the tail as constructors the Buckingham Group got to work.\n\nYet chief operating officer Lungi Macebo still raised hopes earlier this month by declaring at a fans' forum that she was confident the top tiers of the stands would be open for Stoke's visit.\n\nA club statement last week ended those hopes as City confirmed new ticketing arrangements for their first two League games.\n\nBut Blues are likely to be facing several months of home games at severely reduced capacity.\n\nUnpopular CEO Ren resigned in May to widespread delight among fans, however his exit has left a vacuum in the inexperienced leadership team.\n\nBirmingham have a full repairing lease for the ground from owners Birmingham City Stadium limited so the football club has to find the cash to fix St Andrew's.\n\nThese include repairing corroded steel beams, missing and damaged bolts and the need to apply specialist paint to steelworks.\n\nProminent fan and Blues author Daniel Ivery reflected: “Remembering feeling the Tilton literally bounce during some of those big moments at the ground in recent years, I’ll admit it makes me cringe a little thinking that bounce might have been more to do with structural issues than the passion of Blues fans.”\n\nAfter selling Jude Bellingham for £25m in July 2020, cashflow shouldn't be a problem, yet the catalogue of delays suggest otherwise.\n\nIt all threatens to overshadow and derail a promising, unbeaten start to the season under Bowyer and add to frustrations of fans who , in theory at least, are finally allowed back in."
