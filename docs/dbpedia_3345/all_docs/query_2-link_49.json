        "text": "There have been a lot of eyeballs turned towards Birmingham City ever since seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady became a minority owner at the club.\n\nHaving entered into a partnership with Knighthead Capital Management LLC Brady, Brady holds the capacity of chairman of the advisory board at St Andrew’s which allows him to work directly with members of the club’s leadership team.\n\nGiven the Blues' fall from the Championship, Brady admitted relegation to League One was \"tough\" but promised the club would achieve \"great things in the future\".\n\nArticle continues below\n\nGOAL has you covered to catch Birmingham in action live on TV and online.\n\nHow to watch & stream Birmingham City games on TV & online\n\nBirmingham City's League One games, besides other competitions such as the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, will be shown on Sky Sports in the United Kingdom (UK), with streaming available on Sky Go.\n\nESPN+ and Paramount+ have the right to show several of Birmingham's matches across competitions in the United States (US).\n\nThe occasional game is shown on TNT Sports in the United Kingdom, while also being made available to stream on discovery+.\n\nSome games are also available to stream live on BluesTV - the club's official video streaming service, which also posts highlights.\n\nGetty/GOAL\n\nDoes Birmingham City offer an iFollow subscription?\n\nAll 40 EFL clubs have the option to utilise the iFollow platform and can offer subscriptions to iFollow via their websites.\n\nHowever, as Birmingham City are among the 32 clubs to not opt for the iFollow service, access to the live online feeds will only be through the club's official video streaming service.\n\nUpcoming Birmingham City games on TV\n\nUseful links:"
