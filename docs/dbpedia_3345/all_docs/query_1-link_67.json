        "text": "VERNON CALLS FOR SOCCER PAY CHANGE\n\nFriday, April 1 1960 The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nMAXIMUM WAGE IS HARMFUL TO THE GAME\n\nThe Whole Truth by Roy Vernon.\n\nYou have only to mention pay to be sure of an attentive audience, and the goes for people almost every walk of life.Â Professional footballers, far from being an exception to the rule, are just as keenly concerned as anybody else, and right at this moment I should say more actively interested than most.Â Do I think footballers should have more pay?Â Well, of course, but the answer is not quite as simple as that.Â It is the old, old story all over again, of the law of supply and demand.Â So long as demand races ahead of supply there will be this feeling that soccer players are the poor relation of the entertainment business.Â It is not difficult to find individuals who will tell you that players have never had it so good, but this catch phrase really cuts little ice.Â Even if it is true, is it not equally correct of most jobs?Â The young, and somewhat less responsible members of our fraternity who dash about in large cars by expensive sports cars, create an entirely wrong impression.Â The average family men cannot afford luxuries of that type, and it is as much as most of us can do to stretch our income to take in some sort of economical family car.Â Whether we like it or not, I believe the fact must be faced that in future negotiations we may have to concede that, the First Division is the premier division, and that players in it should be treated as such.Â\n\nHIGHER MINIMUM\n\nNow, I do not need telling that all clubs in the top flight are not equally prosperous.Â The maximum gates of some of them do not reach the average of the more affluent, and that is why I think there is bound to be injustice if only maximum wage is adjudged to a permitted level.Â The solution as I see it is that we should have a higher minimum wage and do away with the maximum in its entirely so that a club can pay their players precisely what they can afford above the lower guaranteed limit.Â At the outset let me make the point that I think it essential that every member of one team should be paid alike.Â Football is a team game and the team is only as strong as the weakest link.Â It may be the forward who cracks in three goals in a match who steals the headlines, and becomes the popular hero, but the full back who is less conspicuous but plays just as vital a role may easily be the saviour of the side.Â I would never ne a party to receiving more than the next man in the team, it would be absolute poison to team spirit.Â We all know that if we do not measure up to a given situation the club will soon make efforts to find someone who will and that is always the incentive.Â Nothing is more compelling than survival.Â If the maximum limit was to be lifted I feel quite confident that a number of our bigger clubs would promptly step up payments.Â These payments would not be a right of course.Â They would have to be earned.Â\n\nNEGOTIATIONS DESIRABLE\n\nIf displays were poor and interest low, gates were thin and receipts shrinking what player in his right senses would expect to have the red carpet treatment?Â I suggest we are reasonable beings and realise that we cannot get blood from a stone, but I feel certain that if players and clubs were allowed to negotiate on points such as this (after all it is the club’s money that is being handed) there would be far less discontent.Â In general you will find players in most clubs willing to pay their management the tribute that at least they can expect fair play.Â I suggest then that there should be graded minimum rates for the divisions, with the maximum limit removed completely.Â There is an obvious criticism that if this were adopted there would be a queue of players wanting to join the select few of the aristocrats.Â I cannot see that this would necessarily be so.Â Top teams in the Second or even Third Division might command such attendances that their reward would compare with the clubs in the top division.Â Look at the experience of Norwich City last season and to a slightly lesser extent this season.Â How many Second Division clubs would be able to pay “higher rates than City if negotiations were free and unfettered?Â Surely there is a greater urge to do well to help one’s club do well.Â The feeling that players would advance with their club would surely be a big help to spirit and enterprise.Â I know quite well, just as you do, that some players have very lucrative sidelines to boost their salaries.Â\n\nONE JOB ENOUGH\n\nThese are very acceptable and very necessary, but can you tell me seriously that any man does two joins or more for the love of it?Â If he made a fair living from one I think that would be quite enough.Â After all it is better for the club that players should concentrate on playing, without having their heads worried with other outside problems.Â I say give this idea a run.Â If it works over a trial period, well and good.Â If not, then there will have to be second thoughts, but please don’t leave the footballers out of any pay increases, that may be going around.Â The cost of living has also increased for them.Â To the question would I encourage my young son to be a professional footballer, I would reply.Â “No, not as things are.”Â Does that mean that I am dissatisfied with my lot in life and the role I have chosen?Â Again no!Â Football is my life and will be my life so long as I can kick a ball sufficiently intelligently to appeal to a football club.Â I would like to see my son take up something more substantial like one of the professions but of course he will have to prove himself fitted for that.Â If he proved to be like me, a lad who eats, drinks and sleeps football that would be the end of it.Â I would not raise a finger to stop him, but I should like him to be satisfied first that he could not do better and be happier in another calling.Â After all happiness in the job is worth a great deal.Â\n\nLAW WORTH Â£50,000\n\nTransfers! Although Â£53,000 is said to have been paid for Dennis Law by Manchester City I still do not cringe at the thought of it.Â Manchester City must have thought he was worth it or they would not have paid it.Â If they are satisfied how can anybody else complain?Â I don’t think Law will be worried in the slightest by the so called millstone about his neck.Â A player says to himself.Â “They paid Â£53,000 for me after watching me play.Â That means that my normal game is enough to satisfy them.Â Why then, try to play above it and be under constant strain and fail to myself justice?”Â That I think is the reasoning I certainly was not worried by my Â£35,000 fee, even though I played terribly in my first match.Â I knew that was sub standard and I could put it right and that if I reached my Blackburn standard with Everton, it was fair to assume that there would be no disappointment.Â Bogies are only created through fear-fear of trying to be something that you are not.Â Play your own game and you will not go far wrong is a bit of sound advice, I was given at an early age, and I still have found no reason to fault it.Â\n\nNext week Roy Vernon will discuss the question-club or country?Â He will give his views on responsibilities of club and players when internationals selectors seek the release of key men at most inconvenient moments.Â\n\nEVERTON’S OLDEST FAN?\n\nFriday, April 1, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy George Harrison\n\nWhen James Hetherington of 29 Wilberforce Road, Walton, Liverpool 4, first started cheering the Everton football team, their mode of transport to away matches was by horse-drawn wagonette.Â He was the team’s baggage-boy in charge of the players luggage, and he supported them from the touchline when they played in Stanley Park.Â With some pride Jim Hetherington feels that he is entitled to claim the title of Everton’s oldest fan.Â For this week he celebrates his 92nd birthday.Â Until two years ago, he held a season ticket for Goodison and very rarely did he miss a home game.Â He is still wonderfully active for his age and as keenly alert in his mind as most men 30 years younger.Â When you get him chatting away on the earlier days of Everton his memory is so keen that he seldom misses a date of any big occasion, no matter how many tears ago.Â Jim began his support of the football club soon after it had taken the name Everton following a breakaway from the original club formed of St. Domingo Chapel members.Â When he club moved to a private ground in a field off Priory Road in 1883 so that they could charge for admission the first “gate” that was taken.Â Jim Hetherington recalls was 14s.Â Another flit” came for Everton the following year when the owner of the field refused to renew their tenancy.Â Off they popped to a field in Anfield Road which they turned into a football ground and their 16-years-old “fan” Hetherington moved with them.Â Ten years after the tiny beginning as St. Domingo’s Chapel team, the Football League was formed and Everton F.C., became one of the first members.Â In 1889 they were runners-up to Preston North End in the League and then came Jim Hatherington’s happiest season to date.Â Under the captaincy of Nick Ross who was paid Â£10 a month as a professional, Everton won the championship of the League in 1891.Â A year later they moved to Goodison Park-where their most ardent supporters has been watching them ever since.Â\n\nA MATCH OF DESTINY AS EVERTON STRUGGLE\n\nFriday, April 1, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy Michael Charters\n\nFew football followers of this area could have thought, at the start of the season last August that three of our local clubs would be struggling to avoid relegation tomorrow, only five Saturdays before the end of the season.Â The threat is there too prominently to be taken lightly, for Everton, Tranmere Rovers and Wrexham.Â Everton particularly, can rarely have had a game more charged with tension and decision than at Birmingham City tomorrow against opponents whose proximity to the Second Division is even more dangerous than their own.Â Everton’s need for not one but two points is obvious if they can succeed in gaining their first away win of the winter at Birmingham, the sigh of relief from club officials and supporters is likely to assure gale-force proportions if they lose, with the visit of Tottenham as the next match.Â Second Division football in this city for both our teams next season could become major probability.Â Everton supporters who say they can’t wait until they see their “new” team blaze a trail of glory in the First Division next season are guilty of jumping the gun in a big way.Â The first essential is to stay there and until the team can produce something tangible from away games, apart from the occasional point, the fight of desperation will continue right up to the last kick-and that will be at Old Trafford. Â The loss of the home points a week ago to Newcastle United was a body blow and the side’s rather inadequate performance against a mediocre Army side at Goodison Park on Monday was no great improvement.Â\n\nTHE MOST VITAL\n\nIt all adds up to the Birmingham game being one of vast importance- certainly the most vital to the club this season.Â The sudden change of conditions through the rains of this week will impose different tactics on a team which has slowly been wilding together after the influx of new faces. Â This is going to be their greatest test so far, for Birmingham showed in the mud against Barcelona in mid-week that they have the heavyweights in Trevor Smith, Dick Neal, and others to revel in heavy going.Â Birmingham’s lively inside trio of Orritt, Weston (the former Wrexham man) and Gordon, plus the speed of Hooper on the wing are bound to extend Everton’s defence which is almost certain to have skipper Tom Jones at left back again for his first League game since his injury at Hillsborough on February 6.Â Manager John Carey, away from Goodison until this morning through his commitment in Dublin with the Irish team against Chile on Wednesday, was not announcing his side until later today, but it will probably be the eleven which beat the Army.Â It seems incredible that a club which has invested a fortune recently in bringing men of star quality into the side, as Everton have, should be in such perilous straits today.Â But the hard fact is there to be faced and if they lose tomorrow they will be in the bottom three with the clubs around them having games in hand.Â It’s no use people crying (as I’ve heard this week) “I just can’t believe it.”Â It is true and only victory tomorrow will ease the way to the better days they hope for next season.Â Get in there and win, Everton?Â Birmingham City; Schofield; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal, Astall, Gordon, Weston, Orritt, Hooper.Â\n\nOUR CITY SCORERS\n\nSeveral readers have asked for a list of scorers of our senior clubs, so here they are;-\n\nEverton; Thomas 12, Collins 10, Shackleton 9, Hickson 6, Harris (J) 6, Vernon 6, Lill 2, Parker 2, Laverick 2, Ring, Wignall, Harris (B), Miller (Burnley), McDonald (Nottingham Forest) and Mortimore (Chelsea) one each.Â\n\nEVERTON KEEP JONES AT LEFT BACK\n\nFriday, April 1, 1960.Â The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nVital Game Tomorrow\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton for the important game against Birmingham at St. Andrews tomorrow will be as against The Army with Tom Jones retaining his place at left-back.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones; Gabriel, Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â\n\nEverton Reserve (v.

The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nEverton have four chances to avoid the doubtful distinction of completing a season without an away victory.Â If they can increase their points total only from the three remaining games at Goodison Park their peril is too obvious to require emphasising.Â As Birmingham City, Everton’s hosts today are also tottering precariously on the tight rope that leads to Division Two, today’s match will have all the intensity of a cup-tie.Â It is no use saying that Everton are a better team than their position implies and that sooner or later the turn of the tide will come.Â It simply has to be “sooner” now.Â Later just will not do and as we saw against Barcelona this Birmingham team can be very difficult indeed to beat.Â They will hope that the defensive strategy which had such a braking effect on Barcelona will similarly bring Everton grinding to a halt.Â The reappearance of Tommy Jones at left back is timely, for this is a game which might easily be decided by the only goal, and the tighter Everton’s defence, the easier it is to remain hopeful, if not exactly confident.Â Birmingham City; Schofield; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Astall, Gordon, Weston, Orritt, Hooper.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones; Gabriel, Labone, Meagan; Hill, Collins, J. Harris, Vernon, Ring.Â\n\nEVERTON LOST GRIP IN THE CLOSING MINUTES\n\nSaturday, April 2, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBirmingham 2, Everton 2\n\nBy Michael Charters\n\nBirmingham:- Schofield; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Astall, Gordon, Weston, Orritt, Hooper.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones (Captain); Harris (B), Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â Referee; Mr. J.W. Hunt (Portsmouth).Â\n\nJim Gabriel missed his first game since he joined Everton a month ago, as he had not fully recovered from a painful tooth extraction on Thursday.Â Brian Harris replaced him at right half.Â Both teams made a slow start, and seemed to be finding difficulty in ganging the strength of their passes on the treacherous going.Â But the first clear cut attack from Birmingham saw Watts lob the ball over to the far post and Hopper made a fine header which Dunlop saved at full stretch.Â\n\nCOLLINS IS BUSY\n\nBirmingham were having slightly the better of matters in the early stages with Everton’s forwards unable to get going although Collins was doing a lot of work in midfield.Â Everton were inclined to keep the ball a little too close, and so far there were more errors than good football, although the pitch had much to do with it.Â The first flash of good football from Everton, a link-up between Ring and Jimmy Harris the winger collecting a fine past and hitting the side netting with his shot as Scholfield came out.Â This move seemed to put some fire into Everton for they took the lead after 17 minutes through Vernon.Â It started with Collins sending a beautiful pass over Smith’s head, for Jimmy Harris to collect, and hit the far upright with a lobbed shot.Â The ball rebounded out and Vernon hammered it into the net from 10 yards.Â Collins was very much the forward star, and his passes were always accurate and thoughtful.Â He send Ring away for a move which should have produced another Everton goal but when the winger centred high over Schofield, Lill ran in and shot first time wide of the far upright when a little more care must have put the ball between the sticks.Â Collins was at last inspiring Everton to play better football and another pass from the little Scot gave Lill his second chance within a minute of scoring but the winger shot straight at Schofield who saved the shot on his knees.Â\n\nTHE EQUALISER\n\nThen Birmingham equalised after 23 minutes in a break-away.Â Major credit for the goal goes to Gordon, who worked the ball cleverly through and shot hard from the edge of the penalty area the ball being deflected off Labone to the unmarked Astall in the inside left position.Â The Birmingham man put it in the net with Dunlop on the ground having dived for an attempted interception of Gordon’s initial shot.Â These goals had put some life into the game at last, but not much good football, and Jimmy Harris was slow with a good chance when put through by Vernon allowing Smith to come back and recover for a corner.Â\n\nGOALKEEPER’S DIVE\n\nWeston with a good over-head flick from Ormitt’s centre almost but Birmingham ahead, the ball just slipping wide of the post and then Ring going through after Vernon had forced his way past a couple of Birmingham men had to hurdle over Schofield as the goalkeeper dive at his feet.Â Brian Harris had to concede a corner from a good lob by Hooper who had switched over to the right wing, and from the kick Neal came up to end his considerable height and headed the ball across the face of the goal with no Birmingham man able to touch it in.Â It was Everton who took the lead again after 37 minutes through Jimmy Harris, who had a simple job of putting the ball in the net after a magnificent right wing move.Â It started with Parker slipping the ball up to Lill who transferred it to Vernon and the inside man beat off Smith’s tackle brilliantly to take the ball practically up to Schofield and slip it across to the unmarked Harris to put it home.Â This was rather like the first Everton goal in reverse and the first flash of really good football we had seen in this half.Â\n\nHalf-time; Birmingham 1, Everton 2.\n\nEverton playing with a strong wind behind them this half were quickly on the attack with Collins and Vernon between them working an opening for Ring, who shot past Smith, but put the ball high over the bar as Farmer challenged.Â\n\nCENTRES TOO STRONG\n\nRing was inclined to put too much power behind his centres and on one occasion when Jimmy Harris sent him away Vernon and Collins were well placed for a cross but the ball went flying over the line yards beyond the far post.Â Everton were very much on top now, with the defence looking steadier and the forwards working better than they had done, Parker intercepted a long pass to Hooper and his centre was pushed back by Harris for Ring to try a shot on the run, but again the winger’s aim was inaccurate and the ball flew wide.Â Collins was sending out passes gauged to the last inch and one floating high ball down the wing for Jimmy Harris to chase was a masterpiece.Â Harris turned the ball in with Collins collecting it and pushing back for Lill to try a shot but again the ball went wide.\n\nEVERTON ON TOP\n\nMeagan and Brian Harris were both playing excellently in support of their attack and coming through to push passes out to either wing.Â Little had been seen of Birmingham this half, and when they did move near Everton’s goal their finishing was most inaccurate.Â Jimmy Harris was doing very well in drifting out to either wing intelligently, but Ring was not having a good day, and Collins was still the most impressive member of the line.Â Birmingham were now putting on a spurt mainly concentrated down the right wing but Meagan was now keeping a tight check on the danger man Gordon.Â\n\nSLOW HANDCLAP\n\nThe Birmingham crowd were giving their side the slow hand-clap and they were certainly playing with the desperation of a side weighed down in the bottom regions of the league.Â Everton had much more confidence and were showing the better ideas although the position would have been much happier if they could get a third goal.Â The chance came just as I had said that as Ring bored through the middle and gave Lill an open goal but the winger placed his shot almost straight at Schofield and the golden chance was lost.Â\n\nSPOT OF BOTHER\n\nOrritt and Collins were involved in a spot of bother with both of them struggling on the ground and that excellent referee Mr. Hunt had a word with both of them before awarding a free-kick against Collins.Â Contentions moment in the match although within a minute Mr. Hunt was having a take to Neal after a tackle on Vernon.Â Everton were still searching for the goal they needed desperately but it was Birmingham who got it instead after 76 minutes.Â The build-up was a good one with Hopper coming through to beat several men before passing to Weston who slipped it forward and Gordon put it in the net from five yards out.Â Birmingham did not deserve on the second half display to be on level terms, but Everton had missed the boat earlier with their shooting, particularly Lill’s miss only a few minutes earlier.Â The game now more exciting than it had been all through with both teams striving for the goal which could mean all the Second Division football next difference between First and season.Â Everton were still trying to play a classical type of football which didn’t always come off on the pitch and Birmingham were just battering away with pure strength.Â Brian Harris saved Everton with a magnificent header from Hooper centre with Dunlop beaten and Gordon waiting to put the ball into the net.Â Final; Birmingham 2, Everton 2.Â Office attendance 24,872.\n\nLIVERPOOL “C” V EVERTON “C”\n\nSaturday, April 2, 1960 The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nLiverpool had all the play and kept Dunne busy in the Everton goal, Redfern and Lay missed easy chances for Liverpool, McNerney in the Liverpool goal made some clever saves from Bennett and Reef.Â Half-time;

The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nHIS VERDICT WAS; “WE WERE BETTER”\n\nSays Alex Parker\n\nAs we trooped off the pitch a week ago yesterday after losing to Newcastle, we were met by Torry Gillick, the old Everton and Scottish international winger and any hopes we had of receiving some sympathy were soon dashed when he said; “You’re not as good a side as we were before the war.”Â However, he did add that he thought we were unlucky to lose a hard game, and remembering that, most footballers think the same way, regarding the team they played in years before, I suppose that is an much as we could expect.Â Most of the players had met Torry before, for came round to see us at our Glasgow hotel when we were up there a few weeks ago to play Celtic, but the Newcastle match was the first time he had seen in three years.Â He was in Liverpool for a few days holiday and stayed with Gordon Watson, his old team mate.Â Nowadays he is doing very well in Glasgow as a scrap metal merchant, but that does not stop him maintaining his interest in greyhounds.Â He called round to see us training the day before we played Newcastle and after the game he was the guest of honour at the Everton Supporters Club.Â Both Thyne the old Kilmarnock centre half, tells an amusing story about Torry.Â It was a few years ago during a Kilmarnock âRangers match.Â The rain was tipping down and the ball naturally weighed the proverbial ton.Â Torry went across to Bob and as another player went up to head the ball, Torry said; “I wouldn’t head that ball today for a million pounds.”Â “No” said Bob “I don’t blame you.Â I’d think twice about it myself.Â A few minutes later Rangers were two up both scored by Gillick and both with his head!Â\n\nBOGEY SIDE\n\nNewcastle are becoming something of a bogey side to Everton.Â I have played against them three times now and the record reads for 3, against 14, no points.Â We’ll have to do something about that next season.Â I suppose I could be accused of being biased but I thought we were worth a draw last week.Â The Newcastle playing strip of vertical striped stockings and white edging to their shorts, has come in for some criticism in the past but I think it looks very smart and apparent I am not alone.Â A friend of mine who sat in the stands told me that he came down the steps after the game behind two ladies and overheard one of them say; “I didn’t think much of the game, my dear, but I though those Newcastle boys looked awfully sweet.”Â Last Monday we played our annual match with the Army, and having only recently been “transferred” from them I met quite a few old friends.Â Three of the side were playing with me when I was in the team- White, Smith and Barnwell all from London clubs (two from Spurs and the other with Arsenal) and all named John.Â\n\nGRAND GAME\n\nDespite having most of the play against the Service boys and seeing shots hit the bar and kicked off the line, with an hour gone we were one down, but once Jimmy Harris had equalised we forged ahead.Â Goalkeeper Godfrey played a grand game and received good support from my three ex-colleagues but as a certain Glasgow scrap metal merchant would say, they are not as good a side as they were when I played for them.Â Our manager just had time to see the game before dashing off to join the Ireland party for Wednesday’s match against Chile.Â It was good to see Roy Vernon selected to play for Wales against Ireland although mingled with the congratulations were a number of leg-pulls as well.Â In addition to Roy’s cap the news came through that Jimmy Gabriel had been picked to play for Scotland Under-23 to play Belgium away on April 20.Â\n\nThis will mean even more to Jimmy than such an honour usually does, for it will help him to settle down in English football with the knowledge that he hasn’t been forgotten back home,” and that the selectors still consider him worthy of wearing Scotland’s jersey.\n\nThen of course, both Jimmy and I are in the 24 players from whom 18 will be named for the Scottish close season tour of Austria, Hungary and Turkey, so we will both be going all out from now till the end of the season trying to book our passages.Â We had a preview of today’s opponents last Tuesday night when their match with Barcelona was televised.Â The Spanish side did not play as well as they did against Wolves and the conditions obviously did not suit them.Â Well as Birmingham played, I suspect it might be a different story in the second leg in Spain although it would be a wonderful thing for British soccer if the Midlands team could pull it off.Â A few seasons ago I played against England Under-23’s for Scotland when Trevor Smith was the English pivot.Â He looked a great prospect then and a “cert” for the full England side when Billy Wright retired.Â Unfortunately he has not made a big a name for himself as I imagined, but on Tuesday night’s play he is playing as well as ever.Â He was the home team’s outstanding defenders and received good support from his backs.Â Our forwards gained a good idea of what they were up against today, while we defenders learned that the men to watch in attack were inside right.Â Gordon and centre forward Weston the ex-Wrexham player.Â On Monday we set off for Blackpool for a few days special training point to the Easter programme.Â Different clubs and players have opposite views on these training breaks but I think they are a good thing.Â Â Â Enjoyable as a soccer career is, like any other job one tends to fall into a routine and a few days away is a good break.Â In addition it can help towards team spirit for all the players live together and there is always somebody who will organise a table tennis or snooker competition.Â The last time we had a snooker competition I managed to reach the first round.Â Not bad for me, although I don’t think it would get me in the Everton Supporters Club side.Â\n\nEVERTON RES V BARNSLEY RES\n\nSaturday, April 2, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nEverton Res;- O’Neill; Bentham, Green; King, Billington, Peat; Temple, Wignall, Shackleton, Shepherd, Laverick.Â Barnlsey; Williams; Green, Walter; Barber, Hopkins, Houston, Smith, Baxter, Connolly, Oliver, Jagger.Â Referee; Mr. A. Arrowsmith (Adlington).Â\n\nBarnsley kicked off for Bentham to check a left wing raid by passing back to O’Neill whose long clearance found Shepherd.Â From Shepherd’s pass, however, Shackleton drove wide of the far post.Â Despite Everton gaining two corners.Â Barnsley were more methodical, particularly in using the open spaces, and O’Neill saved good drives from Oliver and Barber.Â A timely intervention by Bentham started a promising Everton move, but Temple’s hurried centre went straight to Hopkins.Â Barnsley continued to press and Oliver went close, while O’Neill tipped a fierce shot from Baxter over the bar.Â Everton went nearest to scoring when Williams punched a centre into the air and King shot wide.Â Everton improved for Shackleton and Wignall to miss easy chances, but generally speaking the Everton forwards were not blending.Â After Everton had gained two corners Barnsley broke away and their better finishing was again evident when O’Neill had to make a flying save from Oliver.Â Half-time; Everton res nil, Barnsley nil.Â\n\nCITY RETRIEVE POINT AGAINST UNCERTAIN EVERTON\n\nBirmingham Daily Post - Monday 04 April 1960\n\nBy Our Association Football Correspondent CYRIL CHAPMAN\n\nBirmingham City 2, Everton 2.\n\nEverton have gone 36 First Division matches so far this season without recording one away win, and this unusual distinction is likely to be theirs until the end, for none of their remaining hosts can be expected to perform more unhappily than did Birmingham City at St. Andrew's on Saturday. City took little inspiration from their performance against Barcelona during the week and only through some lackadaisical defence work by Everton, and bad misses by their forwards, was defeat avoided .\n\nJudicious use of the cheque book has given Everton a splendid forward line, but once again the Midlands was shown that team-building has been a little lopsided. At The Hawthorns recently, Everton went off at a good gallop, but their defence let slip what the attack had secured.\n\nBirmingham kept Everton at bay for 19 minutes, and then after the centre-forward, Harris, had bundled by Smith and put a shot against the goalpost. Vernon strode in to shoot past Schofield.\n\nThe City goalkeeper should have been beaten again a moment later, but Lill missed his opportunity in a manner which would have grievously perturbed his former manager, Mr. Cullis.Â\n\nAstall's Goal\n\nIt was soon apparent that goals would come at either end if the forwards could only maintain more than intermittent pressure. Birmingham took the first advantage, with a goal from Astall, who scored in the 25th minute after Gordon and Hooper had worked the ball down the right wing. Gordon had a shot diverted from goal and Astall was in the right place at the right time to secure the equalising goal.\n\nThe vulnerability of the Everton defence was further exposed long before half-time, but the City forwards, particularly the three in the centre, could not bear heavily on it to bring more than momentary consternation. Everton scored again six minutes before the first half ended, Harris having a simple task to beat Schofield as Vernon twisted through the left flank of the City defence and gave him the ball near the penalty spot.\n\nIronical Cheers\n\nFor 20 minutes of the second half the victory which continues to elude Everton seemed inevitable. So tame were the City attempts to turn the game the other way, that at one period there were ironical cheers and a minor outburst of slow handclapping, while the Everton forwards (with Lill the chief culprit) were encouraged to take things very casual in front of goal. Then this strange uneasiness In the Everton defence came to Birmingham's aid. Hooper skipped around several opponents, slipped the ball to Weston, who in turn passed to Gordon. Dunlop moved desperately to fill the breach but the shot from the inside-right was too good for him.Â The City defence was in distress a time or two before the close, and Everton might have had a penalty when Ring went down under a scrum of players.Â But they had their chances, and could not now complain.Â\n\nMissing Goals\n\nThe equalizing goal came from the kind of penetrative power which City had not hitherto display.Â Its absence has cost them dear on other occasions, too.Â The more goals in a certain 16 of their 35 matches would have turned seven defeats by one goal into draws, and nine draws into victories-producing o course 16 extra points.Â An additional goal in only eight of these 16 matches would have yielded enough points to put City half-way up the First Division table.Â The point secured on Saturday, plus the failure of Leeds to hold Wolverhampton Wanderers, enabled Birmingham to move unsteadily up a rung of the League ladder.Â But they will slip from it again unless they can recapture the urgency shown against Barcelona.Â Attendance 24, 872.Â\n\nBirmingham City; Scholfield; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Astall, Gordon, Weston, Orritt, Hooper.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones; Harris (B.), Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â\n\nEVERTON CLASS DID NOT BRING THE GOALS\n\nMonday April 4, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBirmingham City 2, Everton 2\n\nBy Michael Charters\n\nEverton brought back a point from Birmingham City on Saturday which was most acceptable in their fight to pull clear of relegation trouble, but the tragedy was that it should have been two, for one again (as at West Bromwich a fortnight ago), they held the lead up to three-quarter time and then lost it to a team always inferior to them in football skill. The pitch was a glutinous mass in midfield and the ball skidded and stopped inconsistently, Everton I thought, were perhaps guilty of trying too many short passes in the churned up area, but it was their shooting-and particularly that of Lill-which cost them a clear-cut victory.Â Twice in the first half Lill failed with good chances, but his worst error came mid-way through the second half when he had a chance with only the goalkeeper to beat and couldn’t succeed in sliding it past Schofield from only a few yards’ range.Â\n\nCOLLINS AT HIS BEST\n\nThe match never reached great heights except in the closing ten minutes when both teams were striving for the vital goal, which could make the difference between First and Second Division football next season.Â If any man worked his heart out it was Collins, who have his finest display of the season with an immaculate display of passing and ball control in the mud, which was far above that of any other player. Vernon was little behind him and had a vital part in both Everton’s goals, but much of the work of these two brilliant players was lost because of weakness on the wings, where Ring and Lill tired to do too much and were robbed by the unceremonious tackling of the Birmingham full backs.Â Jimmy Harris did best when he moved out to the wings, which he did intelligently during Everton’s best spell in the half hour immediately after the interval but Smith held him in the air in the centre, hard as Harris tried to get past him. Everton’s defences collectively and individually were sound with Meagan again the best, keeping a tight hold of Birmingham’s Gordon.Â Brian Harris, coming into the team as a last minute deputy for Gabriel (who was not 100 per cent fit after a tooth extraction) had as fine game and produced one brilliant header late on to save Everton from a cross by Hooper.Â Apart from Smith and Gordon there was little to impress in this Birmingham side, who were very lucky to get a point.Â Orritt their Welsh inside left only came into the game late on and that when he was involved in a brush with Collins, which needed the firm intervention of that excellent referee Mr. Hunt to calm things down.Â Orritt later had his name taken for saying something after a tackle on Vernon and the only time I thought Mr. Hunt erred in an exhibition of fine control was when he refused to give Everton a penalty award as Ring clearly I thought was pushed in the back by Farmer.Â Vernon opened the scoring for Everton after 17 minutes after Jimmy Harris had collected one of Collins inch perfect passes to shoot against the upright.Â Vernon collected the rebound to put it into the empty net.Â Two great chances to Lill following and Jimmy Harris also was slow to put the ball in the net from Vernon’s pass before Astall equalised for Birmingham six minutes later.Â Gordon did the spade work here and his shot was deflected off Labone to the unmarked winger, standing in the inside left position and he hammered it home.Â After 37 minutes Vernon, with one of those inimitable strong dribbles beating off several tackles en route weaved and dummied his way through practically up to Schofield before turning the ball inside for Jimmy Harris to have an easy scoring task.Â The second Birmingham equaliser after 76 minutes following the one good move the home side produced.Â Hooper takes the major credit.Â He had switched to the right wing and cut through to the inside before slipping the ball to Weston who wisely transferred it to the unmarked Gordon and that was that.Â Birmingham:- Schofield; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Astall, Gordon, Weston, Orritt, Hooper.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones (Captain); Harris (B), Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â Referee; Mr. J.W.

The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nEverton players, faced by the most crucial fixtures of the season, are taking a tonic trip to Blackpool today, and will stay there for a few days.Â It had originally been intended that the party would be fourteen strong but Roy Vernon is included in the Welsh team, which plays at Wrexham on Wednesday, and he will report to Chester tonight with the remainder of the International party.Â Everton’s party will comprise Dunlop, Parker, Jones, Bramwell, Gabriel, B. Harris, Labone, Meagan, Lill, Collins, J. Harris, Shackleton, and Ring.Â Not only do Everton have to oppose the League at Goodison Park on Saturday but over the Easter weekend they have three matches in four days, which could well decide whether or not they stay in Division one.Â On Good Friday they are at home to Blackpool with the return game on Monday and a visit to Leicester sandwiched between the two.Â There are signs that Everton’s League position especially when away from home is making them too conscious of possibilities for them to do themselves justice.Â A short break such as is now planned a complete change of scene and a break in routine could have the desired steadying effect.Â I understand that Everton received a circular from the Scottish F.A. last week asking their attitude to the possible release of Gabriel, Collins, and Parker, both for the international game with England and for the tour to Hungary, Austria and Turkey during the close season.Â Everton’s reply was that their players were available for selection for any except Saturday international games this season.Â\n\nEVERTON WERE TOPS IN EVERYTHING BUT FINISH\n\nMonday, April 4, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy Michael Charters\n\nValuable as Everton’s point was from the 2-2 draw at Birmingham City on Saturday, the great disappointment was their inability to make their League position so much safer with a crushing victory.Â The reason was simple- poor shooting after they had cruised through against a poor Birmingham side of their own leisurely and cultured pace to give the home team a football lesson.Â Birmingham played with the Second Division stamp written all over them.Â They will have to produce a fire and rest which they never revealed on Saturday if they are to miss relegation.Â They never matched Everton on the finer points which made Everton’s lack of finish even more frustrating.Â If ever there was a game Everton should have won all season, this was it, it is no exaggeration to say that they should have been three or four in front by the time Birmingham snatched their second equaliser 14 minutes from the end.Â Everton began slowly and seemed to find difficulty in gauging the strength of their passes on the gluey mud of midfield.Â Passes had to be struck truly and firmly to reach their mark but once they settled to the conditions they played top-class football.Â Collins particularly was magnificent in his distribution and his floating of the ball over the heads of the rather cumbersome Birmingham defenders had the home men floundering.Â He worked tremendously hard all through quickly appreciating that the right bath to goal was along the firmer stretches on the wings.Â With Vernon little behind Collins in his control and dribbling, the ball was pumped along the wings consistently and the miracle was that with so much of the play Everton could only score twice.Â Lill and Ring although doing many good things in building up attacks had most of the shooting chances and failed with them all.Â As so often happens the best of them all came to one man- in this case Lill, and this usually dangerous shot had one of those days when nothing could go right for him near goal.Â\n\nBREAKAWAY\n\nAfter Vernon had put Everton ahead, collecting the rebound when Jimmy Harris hit the post with a good shot, Lill had two chances in five minutes to put them three up and coasting home.Â Each time he was through with only the goalkeeper to beat hit one shot straight at Schofield and screwed the next one wide.Â In one of their rare breakaways, Birmingham equalised just after Lill’s second miss. Â It was lucky in that Gordon’s shot struck Labone in flight and was deflected to Astall.Â Dunlop had dived in anticipation of Gordon’s shot and appeared to have it safely covered, but was still grounded when Astall slammed the ball into the net.Â Vernon and Harris linked again for Everton’s second goal after 37 minutes with Vernon going through tenaciously from Lill’s pass to unselfishly slip the ball a cross to an unmarked centre forward to hit it past Schofield.Â For the first time of the second half Everton dominated Birmingham at every point and Dunlop had hardly anything to do.Â The crucial moment came when Lill had the finest opportunity of all to make it 3-1 receiving the ball from Ring ten yards out with only Schofield to beat.Â He shot tamely to the goalkeeper’s right hand and this miss proved the turning point of the game.Â Birmingham’s Hooper switched to the right wing and instantly became their danger man to make a fine run, turn the ball inside to Weston, who slipped it forward for Gordon to score from no more than five yards.\n\nTHRE AWAY\n\nThis was Birmingham’s first attack of the second half, and their only good looking move of the whole game.Â Everton seemed unable to recapture their earlier rhythm afterwards and by the finish it was a case of counting the minutes to see if they could hold on to their point.Â Everton just threw away a point literally handed it to Birmingham by rank bag shooting when they should have walked it.Â Many Everton attacks were top-class up to the penalty area and outstanding as Collins was I thought Jimmy Harris contributed a great deal to their smooth work by his intelligent positioning out on the wings.Â Appreciating that he could not beat the burly Trevor Smith in the air, Harris moved about skilfully and played an effective part all through.Â The defence was sound and effective with Tommy Jones having a fine game on his return.Â He even did a “Parker” on Birmingham by coming up to try a shot (over the top, as it happened but he brought a steadiness to the rearguard which it has lacked in recent matches.Â In front of him, Meagan continued in his brightest form and played a vital role in keeping a tight check on Birmingham’s best forward Gordon who was the only home player with any bright attacking ideas for most of the game.Â Labone completely subdued the foemen Wrexham man Weston who never had a chance to show his speed due to Labone’s fine positional play and coolness when things momentarily looked dangerous.Â Special praised is due, I think to Brian Harris who came in at right half as a last minute deputy for Gabriel who was not feeling well after a tooth extracting.Â Harris did excellently and late on I noted him making a fine header to clear a cross from Hooper which Gordon might well have turned into the net.Â Parker have his usual cleverly effective display and it was notable that Hooper had to switched positions before making his later contribution to Birmingham cause.Â Dunlop only had two good saves to make both from Hooper which in itself gives an indication on the way the game flowed.Â In fact, Everton defence was never extended. Birmingham are desperately short of class players for only Smith, Hooper and Gordon impressed me.Â Wing halves Watts and Neal were pinned on defence and had it not been for the foraging of Gordon, it is doubtful if Birmingham could have scored at all.Â The game of course was vita for both teams and it was good to see that referee Hunt’s reputation for firm control had preceded him so that the only contentious moment came late on when he had a word with Orritt and Collins after they clashed in a rolling struggle for the ball.Â Orritt had his name taken a few moments later after a foul on Vernon but the flare-up was quickly stamped out by Mr. Hunt.Â He gave a fine exhibition of refereeing although he seemed at fault to became me when he seemed at fault to me when he ignored Everton’s appeal for a penalty as Ring was brought down from behind by Farmer.Â\n\nEVERTONM SHAREHOLDERS CRITICISE ACCOMMODATION\n\nTuesday, April 5, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton shareholders still do not like their new accommodation in the Bullens Road Stand.Â “We don’t get the view of the game that we used to get” said one at last nights open meeting of the Everton Shareholders Association.Â “A pen in an obscure corner of the ground from which play cannot be followed was how another described it, and a third said it was a case of “craning your leek to see if a corner is being taken.”Â Mr. Ron Nuttall, chairman said the main purpose of the meeting was to inform the members about the action taken during the last year concerning shareholders accommodation since they had been moved to an “inferior position.”Â “We felt that the decision of the board was perhaps a little unfair to the shareholders” he said.Â “We made our protest at the annual general meeting and we were told that the whole question would be reconsidered.Â The board did give consideration to the matter and decided that they could take no further action.”Â\n\nDEPUTATION REFUSED\n\nMr. Nuttall said the association had made further approaches to the board in an attempt to get them to see a deputation which would make a case for the shareholders being returned to the original position.Â The board had replied that they had given it careful consideration but could make no change in the arrangements which existed last season for financial reasons.Â A member pointed out that the question could not be one of finance because the club had just spent Â£100,000.Â Compared with that the money saved on moving the shareholders from their seats was mere chicken feed.”Â The meeting approved another approach to the board.Â Mr. Barton moved that the meeting write to Mr. John Moores to tell him.Â “We admire his courage and public spirit in turning down what was after all his life’s blood to become a member of the Everton board.”Â Chairman Nuttall “The views expressed by Mr. Barton generally reflect the attitude of the association at the moment.”Â\n\nEXCELLENT SPORTSMAN\n\nMr. J. R Ceig “We all have the club at heart and if Mr. Moore can only put a fraction of the energy and drive that he has put into his business life, then it will not only be for the benefit of the club but the shareholders too.Â He is renowned as an excellent sportsman and no sportsman would act and treat shareholders like the shareholders have been treated.”Â The resolution was carried.Â Â\n\nTHOSE SHAREHOLDERS’ TICKETS\n\nWednesday, April 6, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nWith Leslie Edwards\n\nThough on the face of it Everton football club’s treatment of shareholders seems shabby to put it mildly, there is much more to the matter that appears on the surface indeed, it is a veritable iceberg of a situation with the shareholders getting the public sympathy and the club the blame.Â Let me explain at the outset that original shareholders of the club fifty or sixty years ago became entitled to seats in the stand at the absurdly cheap rate of 7s 6d or in other cases 5s the pair!Â Moreover, these seats were in the choicest position of the centre portion of the Bullens Road stand.Â The important thing is that when shares are officially transferred the concession vanishes and shareholders are then entitled only to stand tickets at the normal price of a few guineas.Â At Everton the list of shareholders has a preponderance of original shareholders names.Â Thus a great number of people have secured for next to nothing over a period of many years the choice seats in the ground.Â\n\nWORTH Â£2,000 A YEAR\n\nWhen Everton a season or two ago, decided to ask shareholders to go to less choice seats at the end of the Bullnes Road stand (and near the raucous voices of the boys’ pen) there was a great deal of criticism.Â The move was made because by making available to season-ticket holders centre seats formerly occupied by shareholders the club could gain some Â£2,000 per year.Â That they have subsequently spent more than Â£100,000 on players does not alter the explanation that valid financial consideration lead to them to their decision about shareholders accommodation.Â It is pointed out that if Everton had demanded increased prices from shareholders for their tickets the wail would have been even greater than that which now assails the Club!Â I know some Liverpool shareholders who would give their eye teeth to have any seat at Anfield providing they were watching First Division football again!Â\n\nEVERTON RES MISS CHANCES\n\nThursday, April 7, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nAston Villa Reserve 3, Everton Reserve 1\n\nEverton Reserves had their chance to win early in the second half but they failed to take it and Villa were allowed to crack the defence twice in the last 10 minutes.Â Villa easily had the better of the first half but could score only one goal by Dixon after 15 minutes.Â Centre forward Bentley laid on Everton’s equaliser five minutes before half time.Â Jimmy Shepherd scoring.Â Villa stormed back and their Ellesmere Port centre forward Ken Price, proved dangerous.Â After 80 minutes he fastened on a long ball, held off two defenders and cracked a rising shot past O’Neill.Â O’Neill produced a magnificent flying save to concede a corner in the last minute, but spoiled his work by misjudging the kick and allowing Price to head his second goal.Â\n\nTWO LATE GOALS FOR VILLA\n\nBirmingham Daily Post - Thursday 07 April 1960\n\nAston Villa Res 3, Everton Res 1\n\nVilla had a firm grasp on this Central league game from the start, and except for a period at the start of the second half, always looked the probable winners.Â When the visitors were at their best they shot poorly, however and Villa scored twice in the last ten minutes.Â Dixon opened the scoring after 15 minutes but before half-time Everton equalized through Shepherd.Â In the 80th minute Price held off two defenders to restore the Villaâs lead and he headed another goal in the last minute.Â\n\nANYONE ELSE SEE THIS FIRST ‘DERBY’?\n\nThursday, April 7, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nWith Leslie Edwards\n\nIs there amongst readers, I wonder, anyone who saw the first match ever played between Everton v Liverpool?Â Mr. W.J. Huntsworth, of The Archorage Ditton-Lane, Leasowe claims the distinction and has such a photographic memory, he remembers nearly all the circumstances.Â It was played he says at Hawthorpe Road, Bootle, and was a cup-tie.Â Liverpool [played their full first team, Everton their reserve side except for three players,-Holt, Jardine and one other.Â Liverpool won 1-0.Â Almost with the last kick of the game Everton claimed a penalty, and amid terrific excitement did not get it.Â Mr. Huntsworth also saw the cup-tie at Fallowfield between Liverpool and Sheffield United.Â All the members of this was a swaying crowd, mixed up with the players and the score 2-2.Â After an incident between Jack Bell and the famous C.B. Fry; Fry made a scathing attack in his magazine on Bell’s sportsmanship.Â My correspondent considers that Fry virtually tripped himself and that Bell was blameless.Â Of Everton’s troublesome pitch, Mr. Huntsworth says; “Everton’s ground was a lip for clinkers and ashes from the docks before the club started to use it.Â The subsoil must be like a bed of cement by now and explains why the water so often lodges on it.”Â\n\nEVERTON DOUBT\n\nThursday, April 7, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton’s team for the important relegation promotion battle against Tottenham Hotspur at Goodison Park will not be announced before tomorrow.Â Gabriel the club’s young Scottish half-back who had an tooth out a week ago, has been troubled by the socket becoming a little septic and Mr. Carey wants to see how the player feels before naming the eleven.Â The players are back from their few days at Blackpool and have derived benefit from the change.Â\n\nPUT COUNTERY BEFORE CLUB SAYS VERNON\n\nFriday, April 8, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nPLAYERS SHOULD BE RELEASED FOR INTERNATIONALS?\n\nThe Whole Truth by Roy Vernon (Everton and Wales)\n\nWhich comes first, club or country?Â It is an intriguing question, and at the very outset let me state as clearly and decisively as I am able, my opinion that, if a player is selected for his country, it is a crime to rob him of the distinction.Â I have yet to meet a player who did not thrill to the sight of his name in an international team no matter how many times he had worn his country’s jersey previously.Â I never take anything for granted, so that if I am included my elation knows no bounds.Â Honestly speaking the kick I get from representing my native Wales is as great today as ever it was.Â If I had been in the position of Tottenham’s Scottish players who were refused permission to play at Hampden Park against England I would have been fearfully disappointed.Â At the same time I realise only too well that this is not an easy problem and that as with almost any question there are two sides to the matter.Â Footballer are credited with being mercenary and of course as they make their living out of the game, the money they receive for it is important, but I do not consider the Â£50 fee for international games is the No1 goal.Â Nobody can afford to brush it aside, but there is more to international appearances than money.Â\n\nINSULT TO INJURY\n\nMind you, if a player is kept out of a match by his club after selection has been indicated, I think it is adding insult to injury to debar him from the monetary reward as well as the honour.Â People never tire of telling us that English football is on the way down- if not the way out-and that we shall never be as good as the overseas sides again.Â Yet what are we doing to prove these moaners wrong?Â So long as it is possible for English clubs to say to Wales, Scotland, or Eire.Â “You cannot have the players you want,” how can they hope to built up international prestige?Â It is said that Welshmen are more fervently nationalistic than the English and possibly that is why I feel so strongly on the question.Â No-one can say “Nay” to England, but the other countries have to go cap in hand for grace and favour.Â How wrong it is.Â The sooner this inequality is swept away the sooner, we shall be able to regard the International Championship as a sporting competition.Â If internationals are important then we should treat them accordingly.Â Let us not undermine their status by playing second choice teams.Â It would be better to face the whole thing squarely and do away with these glittering goals, if they do not mean what they purport to mean- the gathering together of the finest players two countries can field.Â Cheapen a cap and you degrade it.Â Most players would make any sort of sacrifice to represent their country.Â Let us keep it that way.Â So far I have written only of the players point of view, but obviously the clubs, enter into the controversy on an important scale.Â This is a question put to me this week.Â “If you were one of four Everton players selected for Wales, next Saturday, when your club are fighting a battle with the threat of relegation and needing every possible point to avoid a spell in Division Two and Mr. John Carey the manager said it was up to you to decide whether you played for Wales or Everton, what would be your decision?”Â What a headache and I sincerely hope that neither I nor anyone would ever be put in the situation.Â It is most unfair to put the onus on a player.Â Anyway the question was asked and? Must try to answer it.Â Although I have stated that international matches are the peak so far as I am concerned in a situation such as I have outlined I would sacrifice my Cap, and with a heart almost breaking, do my duty by my club.Â After all they are my employers throughout the year.Â Without them I could not live-at least not from football âand while I would be sacrificing glory on the one hand, I would be involving my employers in the loss of many thousands of pounds by contributing to reduced gates in a lower division.Â If the international matches were played earlier in the season the position would not arise in such an acute form, for while two points in the first fortnight are just as important in the League table as two in the last the position has not then crystallised.Â\n\nGROUND PROB...\n\nThey do not seen so important because the threat of relegation or the possibility of a championship or promotion is still a great way off, but it is an illusion all the same it is no way out to crowd the international programme into the opening weeks.Â Later on bad weather would interfere with grounds and crowds.Â Only England with Wembley Stadium have a pitch which is guaranteed to be perfect at any time.Â All other countries have grounds which are played on week by week, and are churned up in muddy weather.Â It is with reluctance that I am forced to the view that only by staging international games in mid-week can we approach any sort of solution.Â I say it is with reluctance, because I am afraid that some of the atmosphere would be lost.Â There are those who argue that if matches were sufficiently interesting the attendances would not be any thinner in mid-week.Â Of course even mid-week games are no guarantee that countries could pick whom they liked with the certainty of having them released by the clubs concerned.Â The recent cases of Dougan and McGrath prove that.Â They were denied release by their club, who said club interests must come first.Â It does not follow therefore that a mid-week arrangement would be the perfect solution.Â If it should be decided to give this experiment a run it is essential it be made compulsory form all clubs to release all players of whatever nationality required for an international team.Â\n\nAVOID CROWDING\n\nIf a club game clashed with an international and there was any real danger of a weakening of club forces then clubs should be given the right to postpone their match if so desired.Â I do not like the idea of crowding all the international games into one hectic, if possibly glorious fortnight at the end of the season.Â Tours and such like might easily interfere and in any event I think the chances of more players graduating to international rank ate brighter over an extended period.Â A fortnight such as I have mentioned would probably find the selected players drawn from a panel.Â Anyone on the outside would have no chance whatever of playing himself inside and international honours are only completely satisfying if one believes they are thoroughly well earned.Â I believe that international football is so important that it warrants priority over everything else, but I do not expect everybody to share that view.Â\n\nGABRIEL PROBLEM\n\nFriday, April 8, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nEverton’s manager Mr. John Carey, has a problem on his mind and because he is still doubtful about the fitness of Scottish half back Gabriel will not name the team to entertain Tottenham until today.Â Gabriel is suffering from a slight stomach disorder and not until a fitness report has been received today will the decision be taken whether or not to include him.Â Actually it could save quite a lot of embarrassment if Gabriel were to be ruled out on medical grounds for I understand Brian Harris came back so successfully at Birmingham that it would appear rough justice if he were to lose his place, without at least another opportunity of trying to consolidate it.Â This match is of such vital importance to both teams, with Tottenham chasing the title and Everton struggling to keep their status that the Scotsmen who were refused permission by their clubs to be considered for their country’s team against England tomorrow will not have much time to worry about events at Hampden Park.Â\n\nTWO IN TWO MINUTES âTHEN NONE IN 180\n\nFriday, April 8, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton have not scored a second half goal home or away since March 12.Â The previous week Vernon scored twice in as many minutes at West Ham.Â Statistics of Everton’s second half dearth of goal in their last four matches sad reading.Â Against Chelsea at home they scored six times in the first 45 minutes then declared; at West Bromwich they led 2-1 and were ultimately beaten 6-2, opposed to Newcastle at home they scored once in the first half and that was that a week ago in Birmingham they led 2-1 and went goalless throughout the second half.Â Thus in the last 18 minutes of first half football they have scored eleven times with no goal in 180 minutes of after interval play.Â This failure to score will keep the fans talking and many odd explanations for it will be aired.Â Mr. Carey like his opposite number at Anfield believe that these things in cycles.Â And statistics he says can be made to prove almost anything.Â The main thing of course, is for a team to get so many early goals none are needed in the second half.Â Let us hope that Everton will do this tomorrow against Tottenham who lost there a season ago after winning the home fixture by 10-4.Â\n\nSIGNIFICANT NOTE...\n\nIt is in Everton’s favour that five Tottenham men were engaged to matches in mid-week but the fine winging of Cliff Jones and Terry Medwin (the son of a Swansea prison office and actually born in the goal there at Wrexham is significant, and when the opposition possesses half-backs of the calibre of Blanchflower and Mackay you may depend on it that the forward will not lack good service of the ball.Â Rightly or wrongly I’m still banking on Everton to confirm my view that they are a team with a splendid future.Â Given freedom from anxiety of fear or relegation they would almost certainly have crowned with success their fine play in three recent away matches.Â Instead they gained only two points.Â If Everton draw more than 50,000 tomorrow-and who can doubt it?Â -they will have had more than 250,000 people at their last five home fixtures.Â Support at that rate would soon help to reimburse them for the same they have spend on players this season.Â It would be a tragedy if after showing so much enterprise and recruiting so much class, the club should fail to maintain their status in Division 1.Â But this is a possibility only the team by their efforts on-field can rule out.Â What most followers of the club would ask of Everton is a sense of urgency but not of break-neck haste in readiness for the player who senses a chance to use it and not transfer the ball all (and the responsibility) to another and the use, more often of forward passes and not the laterals which almost invariably leave the defence intact and still to be beaten.Â To the reader who asks all followers of the club to shout the team home I have only this to say; Let the team deserve the plaudits and they will get them.Â It is football which wins matches.Â\n\nBRIAN HARRIS KEEPS HIS PLACE\n\nFriday, April 8, 1960.

I let him stay the week-end with me. - Tommy saw Jimmy playing for Birkenhead Schools, and first introduced him to big-time football. They remain the best of pals . . . despite that goal. Frankly, we hardly deserved to earn a 2 -2 draw against Everton. Still, it's about the only bit of luck we have had this season and it makes up for the times we have failed to grab a point.\n\nÂ£300,000 OF TALENT IS ON SHOW AT GOODISON\n\nSaturday, April 9, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nRoll up! Roll up, for the greatest show on earth! If we let loose the old time circus publicity in the soccer world that is the type of scream that would be going out for today’s game at Goodison Park, between top-of-the-table Tottenham Hotspur and too-near-bottom-of-the-table for comfort, Everton.Â To assemble these sides has cost not less than Â£300,000.Â Maybe there have been costlier League attractions than this, but Â£300,000 is not bad to be going on with.Â Although Everton will not have their Â£30,000 Scottish half-back signing Jim Gabriel out today, they still field players in Parker, Lill, Collins, Vernon and Ring, whose aggregate fees must top Â£100,000.Â The signing fees generally accepted as being close to the mark are Parker (Â£17,500), Ring (Â£12,000), Collins (Â£23,500, Vernon (Â£35,000) and Lill (Â£20,000).Â The remaining six cost only nominal signing fees.Â Tottenham’s spending has been even more astronomical, for the simple reason that only the two backs, Baker and Henry, plus Harmer in the forward line were recruited the cheap way.Â\n\nÂ£200,000 TEAM\n\nFor the remainder, I don’t think it is stretching fees for the purpose of adding colour to this assembly of some of the most costly football flesh in the country to assess the outlay at Â£200,000 plus.Â Maybe there are still those who consider, two shillings too high a price to pay to watch some League football, but surely this is in a different category.Â It takes n awful lot of two shillings, and for that matter the higher prices for other parts of the ground as well, to recoup financial outlays of this magnitude.Â Had Scotland been allowed a free choice for today’s game with England, the odds are that half the side would have been recruited from the two teams on view today.Â The Goodison fixture tingles with possibilities and as there has been no lack of public responses to Everton’s record outlay of cash since February it does not seem too much to hope that the attendance today will top 60,000, which would make it the biggest of the season, with quite a bit to spare.Â Since the advent of the big names 207,056 spectators have seen Everton’s four home games.Â They are thrilling figures, and although results have not been consistently encouraging, only the unfriend, lies treatment by the weather can fail to see the average stepped up.Â All appearances are that this will be a great thrill-packed match.Â\n\nCUP-TIE OUTPUT\n\nCup-tie output is required of both teams and I think we will get it.Â It may seem ridiculous to suggest that a team down among the clubs with most to fear regarding the season’s final reckoning will beat the mighty Spurs, a club which has won almost as many games away from home as Everton are credited with at Goodison Park, but I don’t think the home team will let down their supporters.Â They can play football to match the best, when in the mood and I do not think at this stage the inability of Gabriel to take his place in the half back line will have any weakening effect.Â The forwards, I consider will play their part.Â The query lies heavily on defence.Â Everton just cannot afford to fall and I do not think they will.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones; B.

The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nCHANCE TO BEAT LEADERS IN LITTLE INTERNATIONAL\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nWhile the major Hampden battle goes on in Scotland we have, at Goodison Park a match of even greater interest to fans in this city.Â The result will have bearing on Everton’s hopes of remaining in Division 1 and on Tottenham’s chances of the championship.Â With so many Welsh and Scottish internationals on view the fixture becomes almost one of international character.Â For the fifth successive time the terraces and stands should be filled by more than 50,000 people, most of them desperately anxious to see Everton take a step towards safety.Â I think they will.Â Tottenham have rather gone off the boil recently and even if they were still in their earlier form which took them to the top the new Everton’s class and power would, I think pose a problem they could not solve.Â Everton’s worse side is their over-anxiety. Â They are also afflicted by a break-neck haste which sometimes prevents them from accepting, as they should hard won shooting chances.Â Mr. Carey is relying on the side which promised to win at Birmingham, but which only got a point and thus Gabriel remains out and Brian Harris continues at right half-back.Â\n\nMEDWIN RECALLED\n\nTerry Medwin’s splendid mid-week display for Wales has persuaded Tottenham to recall him but as centre-forward and not in his international role of the right winger.Â Mr. Billy Nicholson the Spurs chief who saw Medwin score two goals against Ireland said “I think Terry is just the type to help put back to scoring power, into our attack” Medwin is recalled after missing the last five leagues games.Â He has led the Spurs attack before but not this season and prefers playing on the wing.Â But as he said when he heard of his credit I’m back in the side.Â That is what matters most.”Â Medwin takes over from Bobby Smith and John Smith the former West Ham wing half and England 12th man against Ireland last November makes his first appearance for his new club at inside left.Â Allen dropping out.Â These are the only changes from the side which drew 1-1 with bottom of the table Luton last week.Â Everton just cannot afford to fall and I do not think they will.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Jones; B.

The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nCOLLINS AND HARRIS ON TARGET\n\nEverton 2, Tottenham 1\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton;- Dunlop; Parker, Jones (TE) (Captain); Harris (B), Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â Tottenham Hotspur;- Brown; Baker, Henry; Blanchflower, Marchi, Mackay; White, Harmer, Medwin, Smith (J), Jones (C.).Â Referee; Mr. J. Powell (Rotherham).Â\n\nThe weather was almost perfect for a match in which there was as much at stake for Everton as for their opponents.Â Everton might well have scored in the opening minute when Parker nodding the ball upfield strongly from Brown’s clearance put Collins in with a chance.Â Although Brown was caught on of, position the ball tangled in Collins legs and he lost possession at the critical moment.Â He was able to square the ball back for Ring whose angled shot was wide.Â Blanchflower who was unlucky to lose his foothold after he had engineered a first class move down the right.Â A centre by Jimmy Harris caused Spurs some embarrassment and then a shot from the same player almost caught Brown unsighted.Â Dunlop picked up without difficulty a low shot by Jones and then Jimmy Harris with a fine burst through the inside-left position cut the ball back and Collins was a little unlucky to find it rebound off Henry.Â Collins inadvertently presented Harmer with the ball and led to a rare escape for Everton.Â Harmer switched the ball to Jones who was making his shooting angle square when he was brought down by the joined tackle of Harris (B.) and Meagan.Â Sours, too had a moment of anxiety when following a long high ball by Vernon, Brown instead of making the catch, allowed the ball to escape from his possession overhead and reclaimed, it only at the second attempt.Â When White with a stunning shot cracked the ball against the bar and out of play, the referee ruled that Dunlop had got his finger to it and give Tottenham a corner.Â So far it was a match not living up to its label as a great game in prospect and to be candid Spurs were doing rather the better.Â A misheader by Labone fed to another header by Smith (J) and it was well that Dunlop was in the right spot at the right moment.Â By comparison with Everton’s desperate defence.Â Tottenham’s polished use of the ball when getting themselves out of trouble had raised the enthusiasm of Evertonians who know good stuff when they see it.\n\nPUZZLING SWITCHES\n\nSpurs propensity of switching their forwards must have puzzled Everton, as it did me.Â At the moment Cliff Jones was at outside right and White was on the other flank.Â Jimmy Harris juggling of the ball beyond two defenders on the right led to a cross goal pass to Ring whose centre was slightly too strong to be of use to anyone.Â The only direct move for a long time was a penetrative shot at goal by Blanchflower, and this swerved into the side-netting.Â It was noticeable that Harris (J) seemed to be very much on his own when the ball came through down the centre.Â Parker tried a similar type of shot from an even greater distance but this too, flew wide and had very little chance of beating the wide-awake Brown.Â Ring was having no sort of show at all against Baker and there was a terrible wastage of a lovely pass by Collins when the full back once again won the duel.Â Dunlop had to come to the edge of his penalty box to deny Jones who was about to pick up a glorious through pass.Â Everton’s dallying and dallying had the crowd murmuring disgustedly.Â Spurs best combined move on the left led to White missing a sitter, kicking round the ball when the odds were that Dunlop would have to take it from the back of the net.Â If Spurs had completed their movements as well as they began and developed them Everton’s position by this time would have been well nigh hopeless.Â Half-time; Everton nil, Spurs nil.Â\n\nThe start of the second half was positively funereal with Everton emerging from the subway looking as though they appreciated the intensity of their task.Â But there was soon unroar following a tackle by right back Baker on Ring.Â\n\nGOOD HEADERS\n\nEverton were certainly worrying Spurs into mistakes by persistent tackling but Spurs still found the open space, and used them well.Â Everton’s best move to date was completed by a header from Vernon and a second header from Lill with Brown saving splendidly.Â Lill was damaged by making this effort, and it was while he was getting to his feet that Spurs took the ball down the right wing, where Medwin pulled back a perfect centre for Jones to score almost as he pleased from the centre forward position.Â This was at 52 minutes.Â This was a tremendous blow to Everton’s hopes but three minutes later they won a corner on the right and Lill delivered a centre which Vernon flicked overhead in the general direction of goal and which Jimmy Harris promptly hooked in on the volley to equalise.Â The goal not only gave Everton a chance of a point, it was their first in the second half in the last five matches on this pitch.Â Brown was soon dealing with a charley reverse pass from his own half-back Mackay and Everton had gained a good deal of zip from their unexpected goal.Â The referee for a second time waved away a penalty appeal when the crowd though a Spurs defender raised his hands to pick up a ball intended for Lill.Â Everton still found it very difficult indeed to cut into the Spurs forward moves and it took the united efforts of Labone and Parker to stop Cliff Jones hereabouts.Â Labone was covering a wide area with his long legs and short tackles but there was never any doubt to anyone’s mind that this was a match between a potential championship and a potential relegation team.Â Baker made a wonderful hook to defeat Ring as the Everton man ran in from a centre by Lill and for once Spurs seemed a little non-plusses but they soon settle down to the old routine of making the Everton defenders chase the ball and Dunlop did well to turn over the bar a cross from Medwin.Â When Ring for the first time got clear of his man he ran almost half the length of the field before crossing a perfect centre which Lill nodded downwards on to the goal line and as it seemed, straight into Brown’s hands.Â But the ball spun from the goalkeepers’ grip and Collins flung out a right foot to score from the closest range at 68 minutes.Â Immediately afterwards at the other end Medwin with a flying header steered the ball inches wide of the upright.Â Jimmy Harris with a first class centre and little Collins with an equally good header had Brown stretching to the far goal angle to turn the ball for a corner and then Harris (J) was unsighted otherwise he must have converted with his head a long centre by Ring.Â The best finessed on the game was the back heel touch by Lill which unhappily failed to find Harris.Â This could have produced the third goal and ensued the certainly of two most valuable points.Â Lill and Harris were the striking forces in the Everton line and between them now contrived an opening from which Harris hit a big shot a foot or two over the bar.Â Then the same player hit an even stronger one for which Brown had positioned himself perfectly.Â We now started to endure the last five minutes agony of suspense.Â It seemed interminable and thousands who dare not wait to look made their way home rather than endure it.Â Spurs got a corner in the last minute and all twenty-two players were in Everton’s half before Collins fastened on the ball and cleared it.Â\n\nFinal;

The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nThey Have The Men Who Matter, Says Alex Parker\n\nThere is only one thing that soccer clubs want to win more than the Cup or the League, and that is the Cup and the League.Â Just how difficult this is borne by the fact only Preston and Aston Villa have ever done it and that before the turn of the century when competition wasn’t as fierce as it is now.Â Well, I think that this season we are going to see history made, for I think that Wolves are going to be the third team to pull off the “double.” I have mentioned in this column before what I think of the Molineux side and my admiration for them has not diminished despite their European Cup exit to Barcelona.Â It is a well-known fact that a team’s strength lies in the half-back line and who will deny that Clamp, Slater, and Flowers are the best in Britain.Â That is proved by the fact that two of them were picked for the England side to play Scotland today, and although I agree with the selection of Ronnie Clayton if Eddie Clamp had played it would not have eased my own country’s task to any noticeable extent.Â Of course their strength lies not only in their middle line for Peter Broadbent is one of the best inside forwards in the country, and although I haven’t seen outright Gerry Mannion he is certainly doing enough at the moment to ensure his side wins.Â Naturally, they will find it easier to win the Cup than the League as they need only one victory to do so.Â Much as I admire Blackburn’s Clayton, Dobing, Douglas, Woods and Co, I think they will be collecting runners up medals after the Wembley game.Â\n\nDECIDER\n\nAs I write Wolves are level with Spurs at the top of the table with six matches to play, but I see the London side have to play at Molineux and the game may decide who represents England in the European Cup next season.Â Despite my friendship with fellow-Scots Bill Brown, Davey Mackay, and John White, I think it will be Wolves.Â Although the point we gained at Birmingham last week was very welcome, it was a little disappointing that we didn’t grab two.Â Birmingham were rarely in our half, particularly in the second half and when we were leading 2-1 I remember thinking “if we get another we’ll win today.”Â However, the ball just would not go in the net again and the Brum boys came back to equalise late on.Â You have no doubt read many times that when a side is struggling the ball does not run for them, but it certainly did so in the case of Birmingham’s first goal.Â A Brum forward pulled a ball back from the right wing and as there were about five players between him and I it seemed certain that one of them would get it.Â Astall was behind me, so as these seemed no chance of the ball reaching me, I was certain it wouldn’t reach him.Â In case any other home forward got it I moved towards the goal to take up position on the line, but the ball cannoned off Brian Labone and right into the path of Astall who had no difficulty in banging it in.Â If the ball hadn’t struck Brian and if I hadn’t moved my position Astall would never have got near the ball.Â But that’s football.Â\n\nVARIETY SHOW\n\nThe other evening Tommy Ring and his wife, Mr. And Mrs Les Shannon, Brian Labone and my wife and I went to a variety show at St. George’s Hall in aid of the disaster fund for the Applegarth the tug involved in the recent disaster.Â The funds were for the dependants relatives.Â Considering it was such a worthy cause the attendance was disappointing, which was far from the case in relation to the acts.Â There were about a dozen and all were good.Â On the programme, Pat Mooney was billed as “Ireland’s loss, Liverpool’s gain” but it would have been more correct to say that he is “Ireland’s loss.Â Everton’s gain” for in addition to being a very good comedian he is also a strong Evertonian.Â He told me that he goes to all our home games and prior to coming to live in England he used to travel over from Ireland to see the team.Â It’s amazing the amount of work that has to go into a show like this, and I noticed that among the people and organisation who helped were the Everton Supporters Club.Â Last Monday morning we set off for Blackpool for a few days training.Â In the afternoon some of the players went for a stroll along the front, and the others turned their thoughts and feet in the direction of the golf course.Â Before you jump to any conclusions, however, I must stress that it hasn’t been all walks and golf for in the morning we did our usual bout of training and practice matches.Â It made a nice break and I think I can speak for all the players when I say it was very enjoyable and worthwhile.Â Before I close, I would like to thank the twins Vivienne and Chris from Croxteth Road, Sefton Park, for their cleverly drawn good luck greeting.Â\n\nBURY RES V EVERTON RES\n\nSaturday, April 9, 1960.

HARRIS HOOK\n\nMonday, April 11, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton 2, Tottenham Hotspur 1\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\n‘Twas a famous victory!Â Everton’s overthrow of the League leaders, Tottenham Hotspur at Goodison Park, sent the relegation clouds scudding away at least to a respective distance, if not quite out of sight and the score, which must have been sweet music in Wolverhampton Wanderers ears, seriously Tottenham’s prospects of upsetting the Wolves’ hopes of a great Cup and League double.Â If they are to be judged on this showing Tottenahm are entirely unworthy of any champions tag and it is scarcely the most propitious moment of the season, with the last lap being run, to have doubts such as they possess about the best constitution of their forward line.Â They were leaderless and at times seemingly without any scoring plan.Â As a match it was thoroughly enjoyable-from start to finish.Â While Tottenham held sway in the first half they showed more of the prettiest football that was completely effective up to the penalty area edge, but from that moment on they were as unimpressive as any set of amateurs, if the amateurs will pardon the comparison.Â If forward finish had been in any way equal to approach, Tottenham could have been sitting quite happily on a comfortable lead by half time, for though Everton finished like lions there is no denying their jittery start.Â\n\nNO SUPER-MEN\n\nTheir defence did not capitulate, but this was due to a combination of Tottenham’s ineffectiveness and some rather desperate last ditch tackles which were adequate but nerve-shattering a state of affairs which fortunately was remedied as Everton realised that this was no team of super-men.Â Five minutes before the interval, the Everton goal enjoyed a charmed lease of life, when half back Smith, converted to inside forward for the day, and looking about as unhappy as the first man to reach the turnstiles as “ground full” notices are hoisted had only to touch White’s centre right across the face of goal, to score, but somehow succeeded in missing it completely.Â Not renowned as a second half team, Everton soon showed possibilities that Tottenham might pay for their inclination to stroll through a game, rather than win it first and do the strolling afterwards.Â The issue was decided by 15 minutes of high drama which lifted the match way up the entertainment chart.Â When Ring, who had seemed completely out of touch on the wing, was brought down by Baker in the penalty area a loud and concerted appeal for a penalty was ignored, which I rather thought cancelled out a previous foul on Jones, which might easily have produced a spot kick.Â Actually there was more “hand-ball” in this match than in any I have seen all the season-with fewer awards.Â Whether Everton’s defence was grateful to Collins for his role as auxiliary defender I do not know but there were times when he seemed to be more of a hindrance than a help, and the forward line developed a poverty-stricken appearance by his absence from it, for only the speed, spirit and enterprise of Jimmy Harris registered at all.Â It was Collins with the co-operation of Vernon and J. Harris who enabled Lill to test Brown with a header, in a movement which showed that though their approach might be a slightly less cultured, Everton could get there just as well, and possibly better.Â From the high note of Everton promise; disaster struck.Â With Lill struggling to rise after injury, play flowed to the other end of the ground, where White sent Medwin almost to the corner flag, for the ball to be pulled back to Jones, who made scoring seem the most natural thing in the world.Â In 58 minutes just three minutes later, Everton were level.Â From a corner kick Vernon, with an overhead hook that was so delicate that it might have been intended as a pass to J. Harris, gave the centre forward the opportunity for a hook shot on the turn, which was deflected from Brown’s chosen position.Â Harris deserves the greatest credit for keeping down his shot for it was infinitely easier to have ballooned the ball high over the bar.Â Ring, who had been more persistent than successful, was quick to seize on a rebound from Baker’s legs and away he went.Â Lill’s header from a superb centre went directly to Brown for whom it was just as difficult to palm down the ball, and infinitely more dangerous than to catch and clear; knocked it out to the ever-grateful Collins, who simply hammered it into the net in sixty-eight minutes for the decisive goal.Â Too late Sours awoke to the danger confronting them.Â What had been obvious to most people throughout the match, namely that Smith was like a fish out of water in the forward line, suddenly became apparent to Tottenham and he was switched to his rightful position with Mackay trying to repair the hole in the forward line.Â\n\nUSE OF TOUCH\n\nThe goals had made Everton twice the side.Â Their confidence was most marked and although as the minutes passed, the crowd were not at all displeased to find Everton using the touch line much oftener than is their custom, there seemed little or no danger of any last minute slip.Â With results, apart from Birmingham’s win at Blackpool just as acceptable as they could possibly be, one could almost feel the lifting of a load.Â Everton might still go down, but I believe they will come to look back on the day they beat the League leaders as the one that really kept them where they belong-in Division One.Â Tottenham might have fared better had they not been quite so mean to Scotland for to have released Brown would have been no hardship on this showing, I thought the four full backs were excellent, Labone far and away more impressive than Marchi and Meagan getting through his work quite completely, if not quite with the same consummate ease shown by master craftsman Blanchflower.Â Everton;- Dunlop; Parker, Jones (TE) (Captain); Harris (B), Labone, Meagan; Lill, Collins, Harris (J), Vernon, Ring.Â Tottenham Hotspur;- Brown; Baker, Henry; Blanchflower, Marchi, Mackay; White, Harmer, Medwin, Smith (J), Jones (C.).Â Referee; Mr. J.

Lockett, of Stoke on Trent.Â Laverick was dumfounded and stood protesting for some minutes on the touchline, but the referee kept to his decision.Â Then Temple was carried off with a leg injury.Â Despite their late handicap Everton should have won, for throughout they were the better side, but wild finishing prevented them from getting their reward.Â Shackleton scored their goal and Holden equalised.Â\n\nALL WENT RIGHT FOR EVERTON IN THE END\n\nMonday, April 11, 1960. The Liverpool Echo and Evening Express\n\nBy Michael Charters\n\nThe sun shone brightly on Everton on Saturday afternoon-in more ways than one.Â In the glow of a perfect spring day they contrived to beat league-leading Tottenham 2-1 in a tension-packed match where no one could be sure which way the result would go until the final kick and elsewhere four of their rivals hovering with them in the relegation zone were defeated, with the result that their league position by 5 p.m, was so much happier than it had been two hours previously.Â Everton helped themselves to two of the most valuable points for seasons and Nottingham Forest, Manchester City, Leeds United and Luton Town chipped in with their “aid” by losing.Â Had Birmingham City not produced two shock points at Blackpool, (Everton’s double opponents next week-end) one could have said that success over Tottenham had made Everton safe.Â But the margin between them and the five clubs below is still not wide enough for any certainty as ever, the three games over Easter will sort it all out.Â In contrast to Everton’s jubilation musty be Tottenham’s fears that Wolves may now go ahead of them tonight in their game with West Ham.Â Rarely can a game have meant so much to both team as it did on Saturday and that I feel was the reason why the match never quite fulfilled expectations.Â There was so much at stake that the apprehension of the 57,959 crowd spread to the players.Â Nerves were stretched to the limit and the only reason why both sets of forwards didn’t capitalise on jittery mistakes by the defences was that the forwards were nervous too.Â As a result decisive shooting by both sides was limited and both Brown and Dunlop were not unduly extended although it was obvious that Brown’s handling was not up to the standard one expected from a player of his reputation.Â To counteract the absence of goalmouth incidents was the feeling of drama and excitement which never wanted for one moment of the 90 minutes.Â From the opening seconds when Parker robbed Cliff Jones with two tremendous interceptions on the ground and in the air there was something of interest to captivate and delight and alternatively spread alarm but never despondent at some slip or other.Â\n\nPOLISHED SPURS\n\nTottenham played magnificent polished football in midfield with Blanchflower and Mackay impressive in their constructive work.Â Their full backs Henry and Baker were excellent all through, always endeavouring to start attacks from deep in defence.Â The defensive weakness was at centre half where Marchi was troubled by the dash and go of Jimmy Harris, whom I rated Everton’s best forward.Â Marchi was unsure positionally and in the air and Harris earns full marks for an afternoon of great endeavour and much skilful play in moving to the wings.Â The only incident to mar the scene was the contentious moment when Harris and Marchi tangled on the ground near the touch-line with referee Powell and players dashing up to sort it out.Â Mr. Powell some of whose decisions were a puzzle to me talked to both of them before awarding a foul to Everton.Â Tottenham’s finishing was poor reward of some of the beautiful through passes from Blanchflower and Mackay.Â Despite the bewildering series of switches amongst the forwards during which the ball was flicked delightful from man to man they seemed only to lose themselves in a maze of their own making.Â\n\nMEAGAN AGAIN\n\nCliff Jones was well held by Parker, while young John Smith the former West Ham wing half seemed out of place as inside left.Â Little Harmer tricky as he is was never allowed to dominate because Meagan improving every week had another great game.Â Tom Jones played very well and thought his calm approach to many difficulties posed by the clever but punchless Tottenham attack had the right influence on this defensive colleagues Labone for example was the most nervous of all at the start which is understandable, but he pulled himself together to play beautifully later.Â Tottenham undoubtedly had more of the play, particularly in the first half when Everton’s forwards never played well togeth"
