        "text": "Birmingham City have confirmed ambitious plans to create a sports' quarter - and rehome the football club.\n\nOwners Knighthead Capital have outlined their vision for a new base after buying up 48 acres on the city's east side. The American investment house is re-developing the former Wheels site in Bordesley.\n\n‌They envisage a new stadium - plans for a 40,000 to 60,000-capacity arena have been discussed - along with state-of-the-art training facilities and housing. Details of the development are due to be unveiled on Tuesday by Knighthead co-chief executive and club chairman Tom Wagner and chief executive officer Garry Cook.\n\n‌A spokesman said: “The ambition for the sports’ quarter is for it to become a globally recognisable sporting and entertainment location. The goal for the club is to have a world-class stadium, training facilities for men and women, a new academy, community pitches and commercial space to support innovative local businesses - all within walking distance of the city centre.\n\n‌“The plans will not only help realise the vision for the club, but also deliver for east Birmingham as part of the owners’ plan to play a significant role in the ongoing transformation of Birmingham’s infrastructure.”\n\n‌Wagner said: “When we invested, we had an ambitious vision to transform the experience for our fans and make a positive contribution to the growth and vitality of the city of Birmingham. The acquisition of the former Wheels site is an important step in making this a reality. The plans will bring global interest to the club and Birmingham as a whole. It will transform the future of our men’s women’s and academy teams.”\n\nWill Birmingham be relegated this season? Share your predictions in the comments below\n\nKnighthead Capital completed their takeover of the Championship club last summer. They acquired 45.64 per cent of the Midlands side, as well as their current St Andrews’ home. Their first season at the helm has not gone to plan so far. The Blues actually enjoyed a promising start to the season and sat as high as fifth in early October.\n\nHowever, former boss John Eustace was sacked just three days after a victory against West Brom in favour of former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney. He won just two out of his 15 games in charge - a run of form that saw Birmingham slump to 20th.\n\nRooney was eventually replaced by Tony Mowbray. The former Sunderland boss has been forced to take a step back due to health issues, with former manager Gary Rowett returning on an interim basis.\n\nWith five matches of the Championship season remaining, Birmingham are in the relegation zone. They lost 2-1 to leaders Leicester at the weekend."
