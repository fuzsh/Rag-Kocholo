        "text": "Initially playing on waste ground in Nearby Bordesley Green, Birmingham City Football Club made the St Andrew's Stadium home in 1943 and became the first ever champions of the Football League's 2nd division.\n\nSince peaking in 1956 when they won the FA Cup, the Blues have kept a relatively low profile in footballing terms. The club's fans are known as Blue Noses and their mascot is a dog called Beau Brummie.\n\nSt. Andrews Shopping Park is only a four-minute walk from Birmingham City's stadium and can even be seen from the club gates. Here you'll find some major outlets, such as Toys R Us and Boots, as well as high street fashion chains such as Miss Selfridge, Burtons and JD Sports.\n\nLess than half a mile from the football ground is Kingston Hill local park. The green space had several large stones installed in the style of Stonehenge as an alternative to making the long journey to Salisbury for the summer solstice.\n\nLooking for a cheap hotel Near Birmingham City Football Clun? Travelodge Birmingham Central Bull Ring Hotel is only a five-minute drive or Travelodge Birmingham Central Moor Street Hotel is just two miles away."
