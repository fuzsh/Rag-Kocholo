And in terms of seasons in the top division of English football, Birmingham City rank 21st, with 7 year’s participation in the top-tier.\n\nCup-wise the Club’s most recent success was back in 2011, when Blues overcame all the odds to beat Arsenal, one of Europe’s top clubs, to win the League Cup at the Wembley national stadium in front of a sell-out crowd.\n\nBirmingham City Football Club’s aim is to confront and eliminate discrimination, whether by reason of race, colour, nationality, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, ethnic and national origin, disability or gender reassignment.\n\nOur Equality & Diversity Policy applies to every activity and aspect of employment including but not limited to the advertisement of jobs, recruitment, appointment, provision of benefits, allocation of training, promotion, disciplinary proceedings, dismissal, conditions of work, pay, references and the provision of goods or services.\n\nFor more information on Birmingham City Football Club and the roles they recruit for, click here."
