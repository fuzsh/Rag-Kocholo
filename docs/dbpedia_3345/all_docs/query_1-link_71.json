When clubs were paying big fees for our player back in 2014-2017, as they still are, I feel like we were the only club able to get the best out of them and knew how to play them. For example, Jota was brilliant for us but has never set the world alight since leaving us, Odubajo was great and is now doing OK at QPR, Gray did well for Burnley and Watford for a bit but is now at our retirement home QPR. Hogan, Dean and Colin have never really progressed, Hogan is scoring but nothing special, Dean doesn't start for them and Colin has proven to be a decent right back. Sawyers hasn't worked out at West Brom, Ryan Woods' career has not really gone far either. Mepham has been decent for Bournemouth but not progressed very far. Players from the Smith/Warburton era seem to only have been good for us, which makes me think we were the only ones who knew how to properly utilise them\n\nWatched Derby v Bournemouth on Sky last Sunday. Mepham played 90 minutes and looked very composed. He's playing at the top of the Championship and for Wales. Not sure how far you expected him to progress. If/when Bournemouth get promoted it will be interesting to see how he copes in the Premier League and whether he has \"progressed\" as far as his old partner Konsa at Villa.\n\nJimmyP206\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n1 Jul 2021\n\nMessages\n\n812\n\nReaction score\n\n435\n\nLocation\n\nYorkshire\n\n23 Nov 2021\n\n#1,652\n\nWatched Derby v Bournemouth on Sky last Sunday.

According to various sites he went for 12m+, correct me if I am wrong, now Konsa went for a similar amount and has processed massively and is now being tipped to play for England. He is still a very good player but he hasn't exactly set the world alight at Bournemouth\n\nSimon W\n\nActive member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Dec 2000\n\nMessages\n\n8,732\n\nReaction score\n\n6,115\n\nLocation\n\n.. a little village in South Oxfordshire\n\n23 Nov 2021\n\n#1,653\n\nHe is still a very good player but he hasn't exactly set the world alight at Bournemouth\n\nHe set our world alight when he bought down Mbuemo for his red card last May!\n\nBanana\n\nStaying Up\n\nJoined\n\n7 Apr 2000\n\nMessages\n\n102,184\n\nReaction score\n\n51,161\n\nLocation\n\nLondon\n\n23 Nov 2021\n\n#1,654\n\nThink it demonstrates how we buy players for our system/style of play/formation etc whereas others seems to just buy players that they fancy the look of (\"oh that ones looks nice, mummy can I have one please!?\")\n\nBrentford77\n\nActive member\n\nJoined\n\n12 Jul 2017\n\nMessages\n\n2,259\n\nReaction score\n\n6,272\n\nLocation\n\nWest Dean, Wiltshire\n\n23 Nov 2021\n\n#1,655\n\nAnd the key thing was that the defender never knew what Said was going to do either.\n\nAnd honestly, I don’t think he even knew what he was going to do until it happened.

Remember Watford away, night game, not long after he joined us. The way he swerved through their players bought the away end to its feet. Knew then he was extra special and so he proved to be. Bought passion as well as skills and will always be a massive favourite. For me, just ahead of Romaine, but behind Said.\n\nMansley was my favourite player of that time by a merry mile.

Folan is a good shout here for the BFC Mercurial XI.\n\nI’ve got a feeling they both signed at the same time, but it could be my memory playing tricks. According to one of my school mates, Alan Mansley had a second job, working part time in a sweet shop. Maybe that’s why he needed to lose a bit!\n\nGetting back to Jota, he was a fantastic watch. I suppose you can’t blame him for moving for more money, but the old showbiz saying of ‘leave ‘em knowing they want more’ is pretty accurate in his case.\n\nEdmundo\n\nWhinging pom\n\nJoined\n\n5 Apr 2000\n\nMessages\n\n40,511\n\nReaction score\n\n7,574\n\nLocation\n\nAlexandria, NSW or Highbury N5\n\nAB\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\n12 Apr 2000\n\nMessages\n\n23,590\n\nReaction score\n\n21,545\n\nLocation\n\n'Sunny' Leeds\n\n26 Nov 2021\n\n#1,679\n\nPlease stick to Jota!\n\nAs Bidwell found out, easier said than done!\n\nWise old Bee\n\nEl Viejo Zorro Plateado\n\nJoined\n\n7 Apr 2000\n\nMessages\n\n12,128\n\nReaction score\n\n5,451\n\nLocation\n\nSudbury Hill\n\n18 Dec 2021\n\n#1,680\n\nI read that CD Tenerife are interested in signing Jota. CDT having a decent season and looking for a return to the Primera. I really hope this happens and that I will get to see him at the Heliodoro one day. So far, only Javi Venta has played for Brentford and my other club but how brilliant it would be if Jota were to do the same.\n\nHullbee\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\n5 Apr 2005\n\nMessages\n\n19,481\n\nReaction score\n\n3,596\n\nLocation\n\nToliets\n\n19 Dec 2021\n\n#1,681\n\nBit like Tony Folan a hero an amazing player only good for packing boxes now\n\nHerbert\n\nFormerly known as newbee79\n\nJoined\n\n2 Jul 2011\n\nMessages\n\n12,927\n\nReaction score\n\n3,918\n\nLocation\n\nNortholt\n\n21 Dec 2021\n\n#1,682\n\nI reckon Bidwell was a on a booking there, would've have pulled him down if not.\n\nOr just got his undies royally pulled down.\n\nLike Jota and we have done pretty much every time he played against us\n\nHerbert\n\nFormerly known as newbee79\n\nJoined\n\n2 Jul 2011\n\nMessages\n\n12,927\n\nReaction score\n\n3,918\n\nLocation\n\nNortholt\n\n21 Dec 2021\n\n#1,683\n\nBit like Tony Folan a hero an amazing player only good for packing boxes now\n\nOne of the biggest wasted talents I've ever seen, not just for Brentford, as a footballer.\n\nFolan was a class player.\n\nPersonal frailties hindered his progression\n\nBeecareful\n\nActive member\n\nJoined\n\n7 Jan 2020\n\nMessages\n\n2,059\n\nReaction score\n\n1,223\n\nBeat Poet\n\nTubthumping\n\nJoined\n\n12 Sep 2003\n\nMessages\n\n10,299\n\nReaction score\n\n2,475\n\nLocation\n\nHertfordshire\n\n16 Jun 2022\n\n#1,685\n\nMay or may not be retired and seems shortly to complete the purchase of fourth-tier club SD Compostela.\n\nSD Compostela ultima su venta al grupo Rammalloc Sports de Jota Peleteiro\n\nEl actual presidente de la entidad afirmó que el acuerdo se va a cerrar la próxima semana, para empezar a planificar lo antes posible la próxima…\n\nJota Peleteiro, a un paso de comprar el histórico Compostela\n\nEl exfutbolista Jota Peleteiro ultima la adquisición de la SD Compostela, ahora en Segunda RFEF.

Had some good times at Birmingham though. Not sure how they’ll reflect on his time given his talent\n\nDid he?\n\nHe had a shocking time after Steve Cotterill replaced Redknapp and seemed to be universally hated. That was when people suggested he could come back on loan to us as he'd already played for two clubs and that is the most allowed in the season.\n\nI think he blossomed relatively once Monk took over. One take I heard from one of their fans was was \"he's great, but inconsistent\" - some echoes in that from his time with us though I am sure he hit higher heights and has more good memories of his time with us. Maybe he did have some memorable times there too. Three goals and 11 assists in the second season.\n\nI think he was sold a dream by big spending Harry that they were signing loads of great players and heading to the PL ASAP I'm sure he wasn't the only one a bit let down by the reality. Those two seasons of chopping and changing they came 19th and 17th (the latter with a points deduction).\n\nNearly five years since he left us, strange to think.\n\nWise old Bee\n\nEl Viejo Zorro Plateado\n\nJoined\n\n7 Apr 2000\n\nMessages\n\n12,128\n\nReaction score\n\n5,451\n\nLocation\n\nSudbury Hill\n\n17 Jun 2022\n\n#1,699\n\nFeel a bit for Jota, never really worked at Villa.

Naturally I was praising him to the heights but Birmingham fans on there were hugely negative. They didn't appreciate my drawing attention to to the sh*tshow of a club he joined much either."
