We are competing against Netflix, Apple, YouTube and every other form of entertainment you can think about.\n\n\"That’s where young people are spending their time and that’s what we have got to try and capture.\n\n\"That means we need to have a product that is deserving of that time and attention and part of that is the quality of play on the pitch, part of it is the story you are telling, a big part of it is the physical infrastructure.\n\n\"So from day one of our analysis, we asked what are the opportunities to create a new physical infrastructure for the club that is commensurate with our ambitions and that is very much on the cards.”\n\n\"If the Blues purchase is true, this is great news and a massive vote of confidence in our ambitious plans to transform East Birmingham and the land between two high speed stations.\n\n\"Over the next five years thousands of new jobs will be created as the railway opens and this is just the start of a huge transformation that will create jobs, new businesses, new homes and a better place to live.\"\n\n\"This stadium was built many years ago and the lifestyle was very different. There weren’t as many cars on the road, there weren’t as many buses on the road, or trains.\n\n\"People used to walk to the stadium from the local vicinity. One of the challenges now in modern sports is that your sports arena has to be multi-functional, it has to create lots of revenue - not just from tickets, but from hospitality - and if you look at this environment, it’s very difficult to do that.\""
