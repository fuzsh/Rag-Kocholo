        "text": "Birmingham City FC - St Andrew's Stadium\n\nStadium Info\n\nSince the latest re-development, the all-seated capacity of St Andrews is just over 30,000. Three of the stands were re-developed in a period from 1993-99 and the views inside from all areas are very impressive. It has function rooms suitable for business or social events and a large impressive club reception underneath the Spion Kop. A potential move to a multi-purpose City of Birmingham Stadium remains a real possibility with the sale of the current stadium going some way toward funding the new build.\n\nAway Fans\n\nVisiting supporters are seated in the Gil Merrick Stand, in the section closest to the Spion Kop. Approximately a quarter to a half of the Lower Tier is reserved for away fans although for games when the away allocation is increased to 10% of the total capacity, the section extends down towards all but the last section of the lower tier. You can expect a decent bit of banter with the home supporters. You'll come to the away turnstiles first when walking up from the city centre. The quality of the seating and views of the game from the Gil Merrick Stand are both excellent, though there can be a problem with legroom.\n\nStadium Layout\n\nSt Andrew's Stadium seating plan:\n\nWhere To Drink\n\nThere are a whole host of places to eat and drink in the city centre with all budgets catered for. Despite the fact that there are a few pubs in the area, they do fill up quickly and often it takes quite a while to be served. You will find that the majority of pubs in the vicinity of the ground are home supporters only and can be quite intimidating for away fans so the recommendation is to drink in the city centre.\n\nParking\n\nParking at the stadium itself is very limited, but a secure outdoor car park is available at Birmingham Wheels Park, less than 15 minutes walk away, and parking is also permitted in the streets surrounding the ground although you'll need to arrive 90 minutes or so before to guarantee a good spot.\n\nNeed cheap and convenient parking near the stadium? Rent a local resident's driveway and book St Andrew's Stadium parking with YourParkingSpace.Co.Uk\n\nDirections\n\nGet directions to the St Andrew's Stadium from your house by entering your post code or location below:\n\nBy Train\n\nThe nearest / closest train station to Birmingham City's St Andrews Stadium is Birmingham Moor Green. If you're coming into Birmingham by train, you will arrive at New Street Station, the city's main railway station, which is just over two and a half miles from the stadium. The city is fairly well served by rail from most British cities. Birmingham Moor Green station is 20 minutes walk away from the ground.\n\nMost supporters will generally stop off for a beer in town before jumping on any of the buses, of which numbers 57, 57A, 58, 60, 900, 97, 97A all go up to St. Andrews. A taxi should only set you back around Â£6, but if it is close to kick off, journey time can be slow and you should allow 15 minutes or so.\n\nThe Games To See\n\nRivals - Aston Villa, West Brom, Wolves\n\nFANS REVIEWS\n\nTELL US ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES HERE:"
