        "text": "Birmingham City's request for a landmark home game against Wrexham to be played in the United States has been turned down by the EFL.\n\nAmerican-owned Birmingham, fronted by businessman Tom Wagner and NFL legend Tom Brady, saw their team relegated to League One ahead of the new season - meaning they'll now meet fellow north American owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney and Wrexham twice next season.\n\nAhead of the new campaign, Wagner, Brady and Birmingham's board are said to have requested that their home game against Wrexham be played in the US - which would be the first time a competitive English league game is played outside of England or Wales - with Wrexham seemingly given the greenlight themselves. However, the request was denied, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nREAD MORE: Wrexham stars Paul Mullin and James McClean make vile King Charles jibe during promotion party\n\nREAD MORE: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney buy stake in new football club that could have major Wrexham impact\n\nReynolds has already insinuated that he would not be a fan of taking Wrexham away to the United States for an in-season game, wanting their home fans to see as many games as possible. But it appears Birmingham's owners have no such issue, with the Blues chiefs said to be disappointed by the decision by the EFL to reject their request.\n\nBirmingham were relegated to the third-tier of English football last season, despite being sat in 5th place when manager John Eustace was sacked. Wayne Rooney then took over, but was axed after just 83 days, before Tony Mowbray was given the job. He was forced to step down due to illness with Gary Rowett taking charge of the final few games of the season but he could not avoid relegation.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nIntriguingly, Birmingham have now hired a first time head coach in Chris Davies, who has spent the majority of his career as Brendan Rodgers ' assistant, while spending the 2023 season as a senior assistant with Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nConversely, Wrexham achieved a second consecutive promotion after finishing in second place in League Two. They have already made their first signing of the summer in bringing back former loanee Arthur Okonkwo on a permanent transfer after his release from Arsenal.\n\nWrexham are expected to make further marquee signings, with oddsmakers projecting them to compete in the playoffs alongside Birmingham. The Red Dragons will return to the United States for preseason once again, while playing a game in Reynolds home of Vancouver."
