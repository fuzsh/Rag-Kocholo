        "text": "Birmingham City fans probably feel as though they have been trapped in English football’s equivalent of Groundhog Day for the best part of a decade. But like Bill Murray’s character Phil, they might have a happy ending after all.\n\nOver the past seven seasons, the club recorded final league positions of 19th, 19th, 17th, 20th, 18th, 20th and 17th in the Championship. This season, meanwhile, marks their 13th consecutive campaign in the second-tier, a longer stint than any of the other 71 EFL clubs have managed in their respective divisions. “Championship mainstays, you’ll never sing that,” bragged nobody, ever.\n\nFans have trudged to St Andrew’s out of a sense of duty and little else but a takeover completed during the summer has helped put a spring in their step. But first, the backstory.\n\nAs is generally the case with underperforming EFL clubs, on-field mediocrity has, at least in part, been a consequence of chaotic management in the boardroom. Former owner Carson Yeung was arrested on money laundering charges in 2011 – the same year the Blues beat Arsenal to win the EFL Cup – and later imprisoned, and his successors have been mysterious, often silent, businessmen connected to the Chinese-owned, Cayman Islands-based investment company Birmingham Sports Holdings [BSH].\n\nBirmingham marked their badly run club bingo card in permanent ink: they were the first to fall foul of the EFL’s profit and sustainability rules, receiving a nine-point deduction in 2019; ran up debts in excess of £100m; overspent on transfer fees and wages for high-earning, low-achieving players; and the Kop and lower Tilton stands at St Andrew’s deteriorated to such an extent that parts of them have been closed for over two years.\n\nHad they not raised £40m from the sales of Che Adams to Southampton and Jude Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund in consecutive summers, or gone down in one of the years they managed to do just enough to survive, the club’s financial position would have been even more precarious.\n\nMP Shabana Mahmood laid bare the problems in the House of Commons in November last year: “With a crumbling stadium and far removed, invisible ownership, points deductions, and crippling debts worth over £120m – the club continues to swing from crisis to crisis.”\n\nFinally, salvation arrived in typically 2023 football fashion when US hedge fund supremo Tom Wagner, purchased a controlling stake in the club from BSH.\n\nWagner is the managing director of Shelby Companies Limited – named after the dysfunctional gangster family from the Birmingham-based fictional TV show Peaky Blinders – a UK subsidiary of Knighthead Capital Management. He even brought legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady along for the ride.\n\nIn an instant, the mood around the place has been transformed. A promising summer transfer window in which a dozen players, predominantly aged 25 or under, were signed, has been followed by an unbeaten start to the Championship season with the Blues currently squeezed between recent Premier League participants Leicester and Norwich in a play-off position.\n\nAnd despite suffering a hiccup when Buckingham Group, the construction company tasked with repairing the rotting stands, went into administration earlier this week, improvement work on the Kop and lower Tilton is expected to be completed by the end of November with Mace taking over.\n\n“What we’ve got back now is hope really,” Adam Dee, from the Blues Focus podcast, tells i. “It’s just good to be a stable club for once. We have a stable ownership now that we haven’t had for years.”\n\nThe new owners haven’t made any grandiose statements about the future or splashed out huge fees on exciting new players. Their most costly signing was centre-back Dion Sanderson who joined from Wolves for £2m.\n\nBut they have quickly set about rebuilding trust that had been eradicated by the previous regime, making a series of welcome improvements to the stadium’s infrastructure to boost the matchday experience for fans. And crucially, lines of communication have been re-established.\n\n“They’ve improved the inside of the stadium, there are big LED screens outside the stadium,” Dee says. “The fan shop is looking better. Even hot water, we’ve got hot water in the toilet cubicles now!”\n\n“The general feel around the ground is chalk and cheese from what it was under the previous ownership,” adds Neil Cottrell, vice chair of supporter’s group Blues Trust. Like Dee, he uses the word “hope” to describe the sentiment sweeping the fanbase; an indication of their previous hopelessness.\n\n“The early impression has been very favourable indeed,” he adds. “All in all, they’ve come in and said some sensible things, have achieved what they said they were going to do and they seem to have a clear vision about where they want the club to get to but in a considered way rather than making outlandish promises.\n\n“The previous regime tried to say nothing [to fans] to be honest. Occasionally they were dragged kicking and screaming to have to say something particularly around the original closure of the stands. But previous communication was very haphazard, inconsistent and as much as possible they tried to say as little as possible. Whereas the new guys have come in and been clear from the outset about what they want to do.”\n\nWhat was an incoherent and ineffective transfer strategy that was overly reliant on loanees and freebies has made way for a more methodical approach with former Blues midfielder and current director of football Craig Gardner prioritising deals for promising prospects.\n\nAlong with Sanderson (23), the club has brought in a clutch of exciting talents including Ethan Laird (21) from Manchester United, Lee Buchanan (22) from Werder Bremen and Jay Stansfield (20) on loan from Fulham. Cody Drameh (21), a key figure in Luton’s promotion last season, has also arrived from Leeds.\n\nManager John Eustace is still working with one of the oldest squads in the Championship, but there has been a clear drive to bring the average age down. Clearly, the aim is to assemble a more competitive team that can compete in the top half of the Championship, but it could also prove fruitful from a financial perspective.\n\n“The owners are going to put a certain amount of money into the club, but they want to increase the revenue,” Cottrell explains. “It’s a club in [England’s] second city, it carries the name of the city. They think there is a whole lot of potential there and therefore they want to increase revenue streams.\n\n“Clearly one revenue stream that has been useful to a number of clubs like Brentford is getting young players in who perform well and grow and you can sell them on in a couple of years at a profit and reinvest.”\n\nAnd then there’s Brady. Sceptics may argue that the serial Super Bowl winner’s involvement as a minority investor is little more than a sugary PR move, piggybacking on the Hollywood-inspired Welcome to Wrexham story. Brady was spotted in The Roost pub, located a stone’s throw away from St Andrew’s, before Birmingham’s dramatic 1-0 win over Leeds last month.\n\nAccording to the club, Brady, who retired from the NFL in February, has a hands-on role with his job description including “working directly with the club’s board and members of Birmingham City Football Club’s leadership team” and offering advice on “health, nutrition, wellness, and recovery systems and programs”.\n\nDee believes Brady’s involvement “proves that the owners are serious”, while Cottrell says he has brought a “bit of stardust to the place”. Both are in agreement that it is a positive move that can help drive up standards on the training ground and help attract new players.\n\nBefore Brady, there was Bellingham, Birmingham’s boy wonder. The club was mercilessly mocked for its decision to retired his number 22 shirt, but even that has subsided given the 20-year-old’s whirlwind rise from prodigious teenage talent to global superstar and Real Madrid galactico in the space of three years.\n\nBellingham’s exhilarating emergence in the first-team as a 16-year-old offered respite from the apathy, albeit only fleetingly. Maybe now with a new era underway, that positivity will stick around for a while longer."
