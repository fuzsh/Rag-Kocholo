        "text": "Birmingham City are a step closer to a new stadium after their American owners completed the purchase of land under a mile away from their St Andrew's home.\n\nKnighthead aim to leave St Andrew's by August 2029 for the 48-acre former Birmingham Wheels site in Bordesley.\n\nBlues chairman Tom Wagner estimates that the overall Sports Quarter project will cost an estimated Â£2-3bn.\n\n\"My timeframe is lunacy but we'll look to get this completed in five years,\" Wagner told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Five years from August, we'd be in. In a perfect world, if everyone works with us at the same pace, we're willing to work.\n\n\"I'm going to keep saying it, even if it makes people sweat. A lot of it is outside of our control, but that is the goal.\"\n\nBlues are currently in the Championship bottom three, in danger of relegation.\n\nFollowing Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Leicester City, Blues, currently under interim boss Gary Rowett for the rest of the season, are a point from safety with just five games left.\n\nBut Wagner insists that if Blues do get relegated, it will have no effect on the project.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" he said. \"First and foremost, let's stay positive.\n\n\"We have got a lot of confidence in our side and their ability to play out the rest of the season.\n\n\"It's important to note that when we are making a commitment to pursue a multi-billion pound development, we cannot think about what the next few weeks hold. We have to think longer term.\n\n\"The entire project has been based around the development and the infrastructure. This is the first step.\"\n\nKnighthead say the new stadium and training facilities at the site, within walking distance of the city centre, will create a \"world class Sports Quarter\" and create 3,000 jobs.\n\nBirmingham City Council first confirmed last month that the site was in the final stages of being sold off.\n\nTalks over the sale have been ongoing for weeks, involving US-based club chairman Tom Wagner, Blues chief executive Garry Cook and the council's lead commissioner Max Caller, with West Midlands Mayor Andy Street acting as a mediator.\n\n\"The total investment is between Â£2-3bn. I don't know how quickly we can pursue that. I hope with immediacy. \"\n\nA government grant of about Â£17m was secured to help clean up the abandoned site through the levelling-up fund - and work to clear the site has already started as a result of that funding.\n\nThe city council, which declared itself effectively bankrupt in September 2023, has also undertaken to inject a further Â£1.9m as a condition of receiving the money.\n\n\"We are an organisation accustomed to dealing with companies and sovereigns in financial turmoil,\" said Wagner.\n\n\"Most people get nervous and are uncomfortable with that. For us it's a comfort zone. We have great professionals that know how to navigate those waters. Quite honestly, one might argue it makes things a bit easier.\"\n\nThe club say the site will have \"a new multi-use stadium, high-performance training facilities and other mixed-use real estate development including a range of entertainment options\".\n\n\"Our owners have an ambition that is greater than anything this club has ever seen,\" said Cook. \"When we deliver it the impact on the global reputation of Birmingham will be seismic.\"\n\nChairman Wagner added: \"When we invested in Birmingham City, we made it very clear we had an ambitious vision to transform the experience for our fans and make a positive contribution to the growth and vitality of the city.\"\n\nBlues have played at their existing home in Small Heath since 1906.\n\nThey currently have two training grounds.\n\nThe men's first team are based at Henley-in Arden, having taken over the former Wasps training base, while the women and academy sides train at their long-standing establishment in the south of the city in Kings Norton, at Wast Hills.\n\n\"We have had long conversations about what the infrastructure can do to benefit player performance,\" said Wagner.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into Tom's trade secrets, but he has a lot of views on how to use that as a significant competitive advantage in pursuit of excellence on the pitch.\n\n\"Listening to his comments, they really resonate. He has given a lot of thought to what we can do to support the players.\n\n\"The hope and objective is for Birmingham City players to come and extend their careers and play for a long time, because we will be helping them with those things with the same processes Tom used throughout his career.\n\n\"What he did was unprecedented, but that doesn't mean it can't be replicated.\""
