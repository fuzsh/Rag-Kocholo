        "text": "Today I am going to conclude my overview of the footballers who have played for both Fulham and Brentford. We had not yet reached the turn of the new century yesterday and yet the list was already pretty long and comprehensive.\n\nBees manager, Micky Adams, a former Fulham player and manager himself, made one forgettable appearance for the club as a substitute in the Auto Windscreens Shield match at Luton but thankfully concentrated more on his thankless task of attempting to save the club from relegation to the bottom division in 1997/98. He brought in several of his old boys to assist him and Paul Watson was one of his more successful imports. A right footed left back who excelled in swinging in dangerous curling corners and free kicks, he soon became a fan favourite but he was replaced by the quicker Ijah Anderson and left for a successful stay at Brighton.\n\nDanny Cullip was a no-nonsense bullet headed centre half who took no prisoners but he lost his place after damaging his knee and, like Watson, moved on to help Brighton to promotion.\n\nDarren Freeman of the long curly mane, was an effective if inconsistent winger or striker who was surprisingly released by Fulham and had a free scoring start to his Brentford career under Ron Noades before joining the exodus to Brighton.\n\nSteve Sidwell proved to be one of Brentford’s most effective loan signings. Despite his youth and total inexperience, Arsenal entrusted him into the care of Steve Coppell and he quickly flourished into a wonderfully skilful midfielder with a eye for goal and the ability to open up a defence with a single pass. He was far too good to join us on a permanent basis, particularly when we failed to gain promotion in 2002 and he eventually made his mark in the Premier League with the likes of Reading and AstonVilla before providing excellent service to Fulham too.\n\nJohn Salako made his name as a two footed winger with electric pace at Crystal Palace and later enjoyed a short spell at Fulham under Kevin Keegan. he was thirty-five when Martin Allen signed him but he found a new lease of life and produced some excellent spells on the left wing and some less good ones as an emergency left back. He was deadly from the penalty spot too – except when it mattered in front of the television cameras at Hinckley.\n\nMichael Turner was a wonderfully strong and elegant centre half for the Bees and gave us wonderful service for two seasons before being spirited away by Hull City. He became a Premier League regular and last season he played against the Bees for both Norwich City and Fulham.\n\nDarren Pratley continues in his career as combative midfielder who caused us many problems a week or so back when playing for Bolton Wanderers. He began his career at Fulham but made only a single appearance for them as a substitute before he had two successful loan spells at Griffin Park under Martin Allen before joining Swansea. He was hard running and strong with an excellent shot on him and did well for us until he fell out with some of the supporters after a mad and chaotic night at Gillingham in 2006.\n\nPaul Brooker deserves an article all to himself! He was a tricky winger who was predominantly a super sub at Craven Cottage before establishing himself at Brighton. He joined the Bees on a free transfer but despite his obvious talent he never produced or did his ability justice on a regular basis despite scoring a solo goal of utter world class at Swindon and his spell at the club ended in acrimony after he fell out with supporters and management alike.\n\nJunior Lewis drifted from club to club after making his debut for Fulham before making his mark at Gillingham. He joined the Bees as a non-contract player in 2005 and played an immense part in a Boxing Day victory over promotion rivals Swansea City when he totally controlled the midfield. An true on-field leader, he has since become a coach and manager.\n\nCalum Willock was a total waste of over fifty thousand pounds when he signed from Peterborough as the last gasp replacement for DJ Campbell. It is really hard to understand quite why he was so inept given his previous track record as a regular goalscorer for Posh, whom he joined after unsuccessful spells at Fulham, QPR and Bristol Rovers. He scored a mere three goals for the Bees and never looked likely to become the player that was required to spearhead our promotion push. The one abiding memory of him was his farcical and appalling air shot against Barnsley that a naive referee embarrassingly interpreted as having been caused by an opponent’s trip and he awarded us the softest penalty kick imaginable.\n\nJamie Smith had a good spell as an attacking fullback at Crystal Palace and enjoyed a loan spell at Craven Cottage. He joined the Bees on loan from Bristol City in 2006 but never really impressed and missed a very presentable goalscoring opportunity in the playoff defeat by Swansea.\n\nRobert Milson was a young red headed midfielder who along with his colleague Wayne Brown, a small but tricky right winger, joined the Bees on loan in 2008. Milson could certainly play and split the Accrington defence with a perfect through pass for Alan Connell to score an excellent goal and Brown too played an effective role in an improving team before they both returned from when they had come.\n\nRichard Lee was an all-time Brentford favourite for his ability in goal allied to his sunny temperament and I have already written many times about him. He had fallen out of contention at Griffin Park initially through injury and made a surprise loan move to Fulham as injury cover late last season but never played a game. Despite that we still remember him with great fondness!\n\nPacy fullback or winger, Ryan Fredericks had a spell at Griffin Park on loan from Spurs but barely played a game. He is now at Fulham after a short stay at Bristol City.\n\nWe will end, appropriately enough, with Marcello Trotta who is written indelibly in Brentford’s history for what transpired deep into injury time against Doncaster back in 2013. He was brave and confident enough in his own ability to venture back to the club for a second loan spell from Fulham and he helped lead us to promotion and more than vindicated himself. He is now making a great success of his career back in his native Italy.\n\nThere are so many close links between the two clubs, so many shared hero and villains, and we have not even taken into account the careers of Brentford managers such as Bill Dodgin, Fred Callaghan, Micky Adams and Leroy Rosenior who all cut their teeth at Craven Cottage.\n\nRoll on Saturday!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe fallout from the QPR affair in 1967 left Brentford in a parlous financial position which resulted in a series of drastic cuts and the adoption of the new motto – Economy with Efficiency.\n\nAttendances had plummeted, sponsorship, hospitality and merchandising revenues were unheard of and nonexistent and we relied totally on the income generated from gate money, director loans and the begging bowl.\n\nMultitasker supreme, Jimmy Sirrel, took on the unique role of Manager/Coach/Trainer/Scout and was left with a squad of thirteen players with no reserve or junior teams. Balding striker Denis Edwards did become the club’s first ever loan signing but when we tried to make his move permanent, Portsmouth’s asking price of five thousand pounds was far too rich for us and he joined Aldershot instead.\n\nStringent economies ensured that the overall debt was slowly whittled down and with the side struggling for results and reeling from the body blow of losing to non league Guildford City in the FA Cup, twelve thousand pounds was scraped together to bring in Ron Fenton and Allan Mansley – a sum recouped when John Docherty was sold to Reading. The priority was simply survival with results on the field of far less importance.\n\n1968/69 saw the emergence of Mansley as our own version of George Best and bigger clubs began to take notice of him. A large fee was in prospect before opponents, outclassed by his pace and effervescence slowed him down the only way they could, by kicking him, and he was never the same player again. George Dobson was another promising youngster whose career was blighted by injury after looking like he had a bright future.\n\nA run to the Third Round of the Football League Cup raised spirits and put some cash into the coffers and with another injury crisis looming, ten thousand pounds was found from somewhere to bring in Arsenal winger Gordon Neilson. He had played at the top level and was tricky and a goal threat, but failed to establish himself and did not stay long at the club. Not the best use of the funds made available.\n\nThe cuts were having a beneficial effect with an eighteen thousand pound profit achieved, but at a cost given that Brentford entered the new decade still boasting a squad of only fourteen players. We might have been short in numbers but with the likes of Jackie Graham, Chic Brodie, Gordon Phillips, Alan Hawley, Bobby Ross and Peter Gelson, we were long in character, loyalty, grit and determination. Things slowly improved on the pitch under a talented manager in Frank Blunstone, with promotion just missed in 1970, a wonderful run to the fifth round of the FA Cup the following year and then a return to the Third Division in 1972.\n\nThe Man From Uncle, former manager Billy Gray’s young nephew, John Richardson, raised a welcome ten thousand pounds when he left for Fulham and twelve thousand pounds was invested in the elegant Roger Cross, he of the white boots, long throw and venomous shot, who more than justified his fee and was eventually sold for thirty thousand pounds, again to Fulham, who were happy to pick off our best players.\n\nBut old habits died hard when, despite scoring freely throughout a massively successful loan spell, the directors were content to allow Alex Dawson to return to Brighton when personal terms could not be agreed with the burly striker – a shortsighted decision in the extreme.\n\nStewart Houston was well known to Frank Blunstone from their time together at Chelsea and the fifteen thousand pounds invested in him, a massive sum that was only raised with difficulty after much discussion, was entirely justified when he moved back from striker to full back and was signed by Manchester United in December 1973 for a club record fifty thousand pound fee and went on to play for Scotland.\n\nBrentford also hit the jackpot when the board decided to back manager Frank Blunstone’s judgement and paid an initial seven hundred and fifty pounds – chicken feed even by Brentford’s standards – on a tall, raw striker playing for Wimbledon in the Southern League. John O’Mara took time to settle down and initially looked awkward, clumsy and ungainly, but the ugly duckling turned into a swan by dint of his own hard work and Blunstone’s coaching ability.\n\nHis ability to hang in the air, his power and subtle skills on the ground led to a twenty-seven goal season and promotion back to the third tier. Instead of investing for the future, the board reverted to type and a few weeks into the next season, just as the Bees looked like they were beginning to find their feet in the new division, O’Mara was ludicrously sold to fellow Third Division Blackburn Rovers for a paltry fifty thousand pounds, much to the dismay of manager and supporters alike – a disastrous and myopic decision that set the club back years, particularly when his replacement, Stan Webb, signed for a not insignificant ten thousand pounds, despite a decent goalscoring record at his former clubs, Middlesbrough and Carlisle, proved to be a total damp squib.\n\nWith relegation looming on the horizon the board finally relented and paid around twenty-five thousand pounds to bring back Roger Cross and sign tricky winger Barry Salvage from QPR – too little – too late as the Bees fell straight back down to the bottom division and were almost forced to seek re-election the following season. Money was found to sign Dave Simmons, Willie Brown and Terry Johnson who all did well for the club, although Brown was mystifyingly sold to Torquay at a time when he was still scoring freely for the Bees.\n\nBut otherwise the cheque book was firmly locked away as austerity ruled again at Brentford in the mid-70’s until new manager John Docherty arrested the rot and a club record twenty-five thousand pounds was lavished in March 1976 on Andy McCulloch, an injury ravaged striker from Oxford United suffering from bad knees.\n\nIt took almost a year to get him properly fit but Andy eventually proved to be a talismanic signing as he formed a deadly fifty-eight goal Little and Large partnership with Steve Phillips – himself a four thousand pound giveaway from Northampton Town. McCulloch was eventually sold for a club record fee of sixty thousand pounds to Jack Charlton’s resurgent Sheffield Wednesday team, a figure that was far too low for a player of his ability, and less than Wednesday were actually prepared to pay for him if the Bees, as always, happy to cash in, had negotiated far harder than they apparently did.\n\nBill Dodgin built a team that won promotion in 1977/78 through playing exuberant and entertaining attacking football. He had a real eye for a player and built his team for a song. Playmaker Dave Carlton cost a mere three thousand pounds, stalwarts Paul Shrubb and Doug Allder were free transfers and only Len Bond (eight thousand pounds), Barry Tucker (ten thousand pounds) and Pat Kruse (twenty thousand pounds – a club record fee for a defender) cost real money. The sale of goal machine, Gordon Sweetzer for thirty thousand pounds to Cambridge United midway through the promotion season, went a long way towards balancing the books, but we shrugged off his loss and maintained our impetus.\n\nChairman Dan Tana was prepared to support his manager and as the Bees struggled to cope with the higher level Dodgin was permitted to make a record double transfer swoop with fifty-eight thousand pounds being spent on defender Jimmy McNichol, who cost a new club record fee of thirty-three thousand pounds from Luton Town, and striker Dean Smith from Leicester City. McNichol was a tough defender with a powerful long range shot who performed consistently over a number of years at the club but Smith flattered to deceive, never made the most of his abundant talent, fell out with Dodgin’s replacement, Fred Callaghan and eventually died tragically young in 2009.\n\nThe loss of McCulloch was a serious blow as he was bizarrely replaced by Lee Holmes, a part-timer from Enfield who unsurprisingly never really looked the part and it was not until March 1980 that the cheque book came out again and the club record was smashed when striker Tony Funnell arrived from Gillingham for a massive fifty thousand pound fee. Funnell was the total antithesis to McCulloch as he was small and nippy and found space in crowded penalty areas, but he was a strange choice by a manager now under pressure for results. Funnell struggled initially although he scored the winning goal on the last day of the season that ensured survival.\n\nMany thanks to Mark Croxford and Paul Briers for their help in jogging my memory and providing me with crucial facts regarding our record signings over the ages.\n\nAHEAD OF THE GAME\n\nFor anyone interested in reading my take on everything that happened both on and off the pitch

for November.\n\nI asked if anyone could list all the Brentford managers who had previously won this award.\n\nI received a few replies, and many thanks to everyone who responded, but I am afraid that nobody came anywhere near providing a comprehensive list.\n\nTo be honest, at the time I set the task, I really had no idea myself of what the correct answer was, so I had to do my own research as well.\n\nWikipedia was of no help in this instance so I consulted the oracle, Mark Croxford, co-author and inspiration of the Big Brentford Book series.\n\nMark has unparalleled records of everything that has happened both on and off the field in and around Griffin Park for the past forty-five years.\n\nNothing, however seemingly inconsequential, escapes his eagle-eyed attention and everything is recorded for posterity – or indeed, the next Big Brentford Book.\n\nMark received my request with total equanimity, he is always totally calm and unflappable, traits that I do not share as I crack at the first sign of pressure.\n\nWithin the hour an email slithered into my inbox with the answer, and I was totally amazed at what I read.\n\nBefore letting the cat out of the bag I will simply ask the following question:\n\nHow many times have Brentford managers won the coveted Manager of the Month Award?\n\nFive, eight, twelve, Fifteen times, perhaps?\n\nWell I was staggered when I added up the numbers.\n\nMark Warburton’s selection in November was the twenty-second time that a Brentford manager has won this coveted award.\n\nFrank Blunstone won twice, both times during the momentous 1971/72 promotion season, in September 1971 and again in March 1972.\n\nSeptember saw Brentford win three out of five matches and hammer Hartlepool and Peterborough at Griffin Park with eleven goals scored in two memorable home games, and March included a promotion clinching run of five consecutive victories inspired by the return of John O’Mara from his harsh five week ban.\n\nJohn Docherty took over the manager’s job from Mike Everitt in early 1975 and revitalised a struggling team.\n\nHis efforts were recognised in April when, with Roger Cross and Micky French scoring eight goals between them, the Bees won four times to finish in an excellent eighth place in the league table.\n\nBill Dodgin’s team played wonderful football throughout the 1977/78 season which was deservedly rewarded with promotion and what is surprising is that he only won the Manager of the Month award once, but there again, Watford, under their own inspiration, Graham Taylor, finished eleven points clear at the top of the table!\n\nDodgin won in March, which saw eight matches crammed into the month and Brentford rose to the challenge with six victories.\n\nOver a decade was to pass until a Brentford manager again caught the eye of the selection panel and the reigns of Fred Callaghan and Frank McLintock passed without reward, as, unsurprisingly did that of Mike Everitt in the early seventies!\n\nCallaghan might have gone close in his first month in charge, April 1980 when his new team went on an undefeated run of four matches before results deteriorated but even in his most memorable season of 1982/83 when his team scored eighty-eight league goals, the results were far too inconsistent for him to have come into serious contention for the award.\n\nThe mid-eighties were a time of mediocrity when an average team played unmemorable football in front of poor attendances, and apathy ruled.\n\nMomentum was restored under Steve Perryman, who was the next Brentford manager to win the award in January 1989.\n\nThis was a wonderful month which saw seven matches pass undefeated and Walsall and Manchester City defeated in the FA Cup.\n\nI will pause for a moment now and ask the question, which Brentford manager has won the Manager of the Month award the most times?\n\nGiven where I have got to in my narrative I suspect that most of you will have guessed that the correct answer is Phil Holder, but what is even more praiseworthy is that he won the award four times in his three seasons in charge.\n\nPhil Holder first won the award in December 1990 when an unbeaten run of five matches saw Brentford begin their challenge for the Playoffs.\n\nBrentford fell for the first time in the Playoffs that season but the following season saw the Third Division title won and Holder’s magnificent achievement was recognised twice, in November 1991 and in April 1992.\n\nNovember saw a cagy draw against fellow promotion aspirants, Birmingham City, a four goal hammering of a poor Wigan team and the amazing come from behind recovery from a two goal halftime deficit to beat a John Williams, “the Flying Postman”, inspired Swansea.\n\nApril saw a procession of five victories including the unforgettable mauling of Fulham as an inspired Brentford team totally delivered at the business end of the season and strode triumphantly towards the title.\n\nHolder’s overall managerial record at the club was highly impressive as he won fifty-nine out of one hundred and thirty-eight league matches over three seasons. There were many other factors than poor management that caused our relegation in 1993 and his achievements merit massive credit.\n\nIndeed Holder even won the Manager of the Month award in our relegation season, in December 1992, when the Bees went undefeated for five matches and ended the year in a comfortable mid table position, looking upwards towards the top of the league rather than down towards the bottom.\n\nUnfortunately our optimism was to be misplaced given how the season ended.\n\nHolder’s successor, David Webb won the award twice, in January 1995 and in August 1996.\n\nBoth seasons were to end in Playoff disappointment, but January 1995 was capped with a scintillating six-nil thrashing of Cambridge United, which saw all the goals scored in the last twenty-five minutes as the opposition, down to ten men after ex-Bee, Billy Manuel saw red, finally capitulated.\n\nAugust 1996 was a time of renewed optimism as our new front four of Nicky Forster, Carl Asaba, Bob Taylor and Marcus Bent threatened to steamroller the opposition, and the month ended with Carl Asaba scoring the club’s fastest ever hat-trick in eight minutes at Shrewsbury.\n\nUnfortunately, the season turned sour after the sale of Nicky Forster and we limped into the Playoffs and a Wembley embarrassment by Crewe Alexandra.\n\n1997/98 was a horrible season marked by fan disaffection and revolt, the exodus of our best players and a fully justified relegation to the bottom division.\n\nAmazingly, new manager Micky Adams, replacing the doomed Eddie May won the award in March 1998 when he inspired his strugglers to three wins and an undefeated five match run.\n\n1998/99 saw an immediate promotion and the appointment of multitasking Owner/Chairman/Manager Ron Noades whose arrival was generally welcomed given the that truth of his “investment” in the club had not yet emerged.\n\nHe won the award in August 1998, one of the few times when a manager won the award in his first ever month as a Football League manager, a feat, of course, matched by Mark Warburton in December 2013, as well as by a more unexpected name in Wally Downes.\n\nNoades and his support team built a vibrant young team packed full of hungry, young, talented players from Non-League and promotion and the title was won in a canter.\n\nSteve Coppell came within a hairsbreadth of leading Brentford to promotion in his one season in charge and he won the award in October 2001, a month of breathtaking achievement when the Bees won all five matches, including wonderful away wins at the two eventually promoted teams, Brighton and Reading.\n\nWally Downes inherited a sinking ship, a team bereft of its best players who left the club after Playoff defeat to Cardiff and with no money to play with.\n\nDespite these handicaps, it all started so well for him and he won the award in August 2002 when he motivated a team of kids, loanees and journeymen to a six match unbeaten run.\n\nUnfortunately there was only one way for him to go from such a wonderful start and he never threatened to win the award again.\n\nMartin Allen’s arrival undoubtedly saved the club from another relegation and he led the club to two marvellous FA Cup runs to the fifth round and two unsuccessful Playoff campaigns.\n\nHe won two Manager of the Month awards in September 2004, after three wins and a draw, and February 2006 which saw a thrashing of Paul Merson’s sleepwalking Walsall team and an excellent win over league leaders, Southend.\n\nAndy Scott turned the club around after the disasters of the Leroy Rosenior, Scott Fitzgerald and Terry Butcher eras and led the Bees to the title in 2009.\n\nHis achievements were recognised in April 2009, a month in which the title was finally won.\n\nHeroes can turn into dunces so quickly in football and Andy Scott went from winning the Manager of the Month award in October 2010 to the sack after the Dagenham debacle in early February 2011.\n\nThat leads us onto the reigns of Uwe Rosler and the current incumbent, Mark Warburton.\n\nUwe won the award in November 2013, which saw five consecutive victories and after his unexpected departure to Wigan, Mark Warburton simply took over the mantle and\n\nensured that the award remained at Griffin Park as he oversaw four wins in December 2013.\n\nPhil Holder has set the bar extremely high with four awards, can Mark Warburton equal or even surpass him?\n\nAll will be revealed over the coming months and years but I fully expect that he will eventually achieve this momentous feat.\n\nOne final thought.\n\nWhat a shame that such an award was not in existence during Harry Curtis’s long and successful reign at the club.\n\nHe would surely have set new records for the number of times a manager received this award!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday I am going to continue my review of all the Brentford managers from the last forty years and pick up my story in March 1980 when four consecutive defeats in a disastrous fortnight meant that the Bees were in free fall.\n\nWith confidence shot to pieces, they looked more than likely to plummet back down into the bottom division, and the writing was on the wall for manager Bill Dodgin.\n\nThe final straw was a listless one-nil home defeat to Rotherham marked by Steve Phillips’s remarkable fourth spot kick miss of the season.\n\nMissed penalties seem such a recurring theme throughout every decade for the Bees.\n\nThis was too much for Chairman Dan Tana who gave Bill Dodgin leave of absence.\n\nTana accepted that it had been a hard decision for him:\n\nThe supporters had been demonstrating in the forecourt at Griffin Park prior to his departure and I’d spoken out on behalf of the manager, telling people that he’d been good enough to get us up and I thought he was good enough to keep us up too.\n\nBill and I spoke about the situation and he’d told me not to worry as he had every faith in being able to turn things around.\n\nBut after the Rotherham game Bill came over to my house and we analysed the whole situation.\n\nBill was no longer convinced that the team would escape the drop, so we came to a mutual decision that he should step aside.\n\nI didn’t sack him. Bill was a very good man.\n\nThis was a sad and ignominious end to his spell at the club and simply reinforced the maxim that however successful a manager might be, memories are short when things start to go bad and there is only ever one inevitable outcome.\n\nFred Callaghan was Tana’s choice to replace Dodgin, who surely deserved better and was certainly a hard act to follow.\n\nCallaghan had recent history at the club and was an obvious and easy choice as the new manager.\n\nHe had been a long-serving, dependable and popular fullback for Fulham, who played nearly three hundred games for the Cottagers before a serious back injury forced him into retirement at the end of the 1973/74 season.\n\nHis style as both a player and a manager was memorably described by a Fulham fan:\n\nWhat he lacked in finesse he made up in shovel loads of panache.\n\nChin jutting out he would steam down the left flank in attack, and in defence he was a no prisoners taken left back.\n\nAfter retirement he soon moved into coaching and enjoyed a successful spell with Enfield before he moved to Griffin Park in February 1977 to assist Bill Dodgin with coaching duties.\n\nHis initial stay coincided with an outstanding run of results and performances as the team soared up the table and at the end of the campaign he left to become manager at Woking.\n\nTana might well say that his decision to replace Dodgin was more than justified as the impetus and influence of the new man in charge revitalised Brentford, who escaped relegation after a fine late season run of results.\n\nCallaghan was a tough taskmaster who soon set out to show who was boss and quickly put his own stamp on things.\n\nIt was certainly his way or the byway!\n\nHe instigated a mini clear out which saw the departure of firm fan favourites such as Len Bond, Dean Smith, Steve Phillips, John Fraser, Barry Tucker and David Carlton.\n\nHe wanted his own men in situ, ideally hungry young players with everything to prove, and, assisted by scout extraordinaire John Griffin, he brought in some of the finest prospects seen at the club for many years.\n\nDavid Crown, Terry Hurlock and Gary Roberts were all inspired bargain buys from non-league clubs.\n\nMark Hill and Barry Silkman were less successful purchases but David McKellar proved to be a calm and safe replacement for Len Bond after some eccentric displays from another inexperienced youngster in Paul McCullough who had singularly failed to impress.\n\nCallaghan tightened up the defence and stabilised the club in his first full season before putting together perhaps Brentford’s finest midfield since the Harper, Greenwood, Hill combination when he swapped Crown for Chris Kamara and took a gamble on Stan Bowles who had been seemingly drifting towards oblivion at Leyton Orient.\n\nBowles sliced opposition defences apart with his precision passes, Kamara was tireless and did his running and covering for him and also had the energy to get into the box to finish off his chances, and Hurlock was “like a caveman carrying a sledgehammer” according to Francis Joseph, the Incredible Hulk, an impassable barrier who could also play the game as well as intimidate.\n\nAn unbeatable combination.\n\nThe team was beginning to gel although they were more dangerous on the counter attack, with a far better record away from home than at Griffin Park, where they struggled to break teams down.\n\nCallaghan made a costly and catastrophic blunder with the signing of an average centre half in Alan Whitehead for a ridiculous tribunal assessed fee of seventy-eight thousand pounds but the Chairman’s and crowd’s frustrations were allayed when his midas touch returned with the signings of strikers Francis Joseph and Tony Mahoney which appeared to put into place the final pieces of the jigsaw.\n\nMahoney came from the scrap heap at Fulham and provided the strength, hold up play and aerial ability and Joseph was a potent combination of pure pace, bravery and finishing ability.\n\nThe 1982/83 team was so nearly an exceptional one as was evidenced by the totally deserved victory over First Division Swansea in the League Cup.\n\nCallaghan’s squad was lopsided incorporating the best strike force and midfield in the league, unfortunately backed up by one of the worst defences and goalkeeper.\n\nAlmost as fast as Joseph, Mahoney and Roberts scored at one end, Messrs Roche, Wilkins and Whitehead threw them in at the other.\n\nFifty goals were scored at home and forty-nine conceded away – a strange and unusual symmetry, and the soft underbelly coupled with the tragic loss of rejuvenated striker Mahoney with a broken leg, whose crack I can still hear to this day, ensured that only four games were won away from home, and the team finished an insipid and disappointing ninth when a promotion berth surely beckoned given the quality under Callaghan’s control.\n\nA massive opportunity squandered through ill luck and under performance, and Callaghan’s chances of glory had gone.\n\nThe decline continued into the following season as players no longer seemed to respond to his approach and the football became ragged and uninspired, with Terry Bullivant a totally inadequate replacement for the retired Stan Bowles and Ian Bolton an even slower centre half than Whitehead.\n\nPerhaps the playing budget had been cut, but his signings were no longer up to the mark.\n\nOur Third Division status was beginning to look under threat, and when the team collapsed spinelessly in the FA Cup at Gillingham, and a three-one lead was squandered in a twelve minute horror show, which saw four goals conceded, the writing was on the wall for Callaghan.\n\nHis brusque manner did not help his cause and Chairman Martin Lange fired him in February 1984 after almost four years in the post.\n\nLange had some misgivings over his decision:\n\nI thought Fred was a good man and a decent manager.\n\nHe had some faults but was a good football man and a terrific judge of a player and knew the lower leagues well.\n\nThat was borne out by the calibre of the players he brought in like Terry Hurlock, Gary Roberts and David Crown.\n\nFred was a good first manager for me and it took a lot of soul searching when I decided it was time for him to go.\n\nIn my heart of hearts I do sometimes look back at that decision and wonder if I should have given him a little bit longer, but his departure was down to my inexperience and I was getting a lot of flack from the fans and took the easy way out.\n\nBrentford were in decline once again, relegation beckoned and a new saviour was needed to help ensure that, at a minimum, our Third Division status was maintained.\n\nThe next managerial episode in our yo-yo existence will be discussed soon!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion lately amongst Brentford fans concerning who they feel is the best Brentford manager of all time.\n\nGiven how well the current incumbent Mark Warburton has performed since his appointment almost a year ago, it is hardly surprising that many fans voted for him.\n\nHow though can you compare him to, say, Harry Curtis or Malcolm MacDonald, who both also had marvellous spells at the helm and maintained their success over a period of many years? Curtis took the Bees from the very depths of the Third Division to near the top of the First, as well as managing us to a War Cup Final victory at Wembley.\n\nHow can anyone else match that?\n\nBut, out of sight, out of mind and there are very few people remaining who have first hand memories of his incredible achievements.\n\nWhat about Jimmy Sirrel and Frank Blunstone whose records bear comparison with any of their successors and surely merit extra kudos given the financial constraints under which they worked?\n\nTime and distance often provide a sense of perspective and enable the emotions to die down and a more reasoned and objective analysis to be made than was perhaps the case at the time.\n\nIn retrospect, the achievement of Wally Downes in keeping the Bees in the third tier of English football, avoiding relegation and also leading us to the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2003, despite working on a shoestring and relying on a ragtag and bobtail of untried kids, the remnants of Steve Coppell’s nearly men of the previous season, journeymen and loanees, merits far more praise than he actually received.\n\nI can only comment on those managers who I have seen at work over the past forty years or so, and over the course of a few articles I will give you a brief reminder of all of them, which might help you all to make up your own mind.\n\nFrank Blunstone became the club’s tenth post-war manager when he left his role as Chelsea’s junior team manager to take over at Griffin Park in December 1969 to succeed Jimmy Sirrel.\n\nHe narrowly beat John Bond to the job but soon put his own stamp on things.\n\nWe just missed out on promotion in his first season with a team that gave little away at the back but also struggled for goals.\n\nBut for the width of the post and a referee’s benevolence we would also have beaten Hull City the following season and found ourselves in the last eight of the FA Cup.\n\nBlunstone brought defensive solidity and organisation, and his contacts at the top level of the game enabled us to bring in real talent such as Roger Cross and Stewart Houston.\n\nHe also spotted the potential in a raw, young and temperamental striker playing at Wimbledon and he brought out the latent ability in John O’Mara and turned him into a potent threat who spearheaded our promotion drive in 1972.\n\nBlunstone was far more ambitious than his board of directors, who restricted him to a squad of just fourteen players but, incredibly, he overcame all the obstacles to win a promotion based on the goals and aerial ability of O’Mara, the flair of John Docherty and Bobby Ross, Jackie Graham’s industry and a tough uncompromising defence that gave little away.\n\nThe Board unforgivably, but not unexpectedly, failed to invest after promotion was won and could not wait to sell major assets in Cross and O’Mara.\n\nThe replacement of John O’Mara by Stan Webb bore an eery resemblance to the Dean Holdsworth/Murray Jones scenario twenty years later and was an equally imbecilic decision.\n\nRelegation in 1973 was inevitable and Blunstone, worn out from having to make bricks without straw, had had more than enough and resigned. He soon fell on his feet at Manchester United and their gain was certainly our loss as an enormously talented young manager was allowed to walk away.\n\nFrank is certain that a massive opportunity to progress was totally squandered:\n\nThe Chairman didn’t have a clue.\n\nHe came up to me once and asked me why we didn’t have better players and when I told him it was because he wouldn’t pay decent wages or transfer fees, he didn’t like it.\n\nHe wouldn’t even give the players a rise when they won promotion.\n\nIn the end the Chairman refused to become more ambitious and I just couldn’t continue working in those conditions.\n\nI simply couldn’t get on with him – everything was always such a struggle.\n\nWhat a sad epitaph and even today, those comments leave me feeling sad, angry and frustrated.\n\nHis replacement was Mike Everitt, a largely inexperienced player-manager at non-league Wimbledon who polarises opinion.\n\nHe was undoubtedly a cheap option and received little support from the directors (now where have we heard that before) and did his best with a wafer thin squad.\n\nHis approach did not go down well with some of his players and he brought in a number of tough bruisers.\n\nUnder his management, Brentford declined rapidly, fell to the bottom of the Football League and barely escaped the need to apply for re-election.\n\nAlan Nelmes was particularly disparaging about Everitt:\n\nHe didn’t have the technical expertise that Frank had and you felt as if the club wasn’t going anywhere with him.\n\nFrank was very advanced in his thinking, ahead of his time, really, and it was a step backwards to have Mike.\n\nWith the club at probably its nadir, he lost his job in January 1975, to be replaced by John Docherty, who, at thirty-four years of age was a three-time former player and crowd favourite.\n\n‘Doc’ had only one full campaign in charge and left in September 1976 at the end of a disappointing stay.\n\nHe did his best to bring in youngsters who he had developed during his coaching spell at Queens Park Rangers and Nigel Smith, Micky French and Gordon Sweetzer were promising talents, but it just didn’t fall into place for him.\n\nRichard Poole played under Blunstone, Everitt and Docherty and has his own first hand view about the three of them:\n\nMr Blunstone was totally fed up with the board room. He was such a good manager for Brentford and a man who loved to work with us youngsters, and when he left for Manchester United it really was Brentford’s loss.\n\nThen we come to Mr Everitt who gave me my chance in the first team for which I will always be grateful.\n\nYes, he did bring in some hard players but then at that time it was what was needed, and I still believe to this day that with a little more time and help from the board he could have turned things around for Brentford.\n\nHe also did well after leaving us too, as he went to Leicester as well as Southampton, though not as a manager, and then ended up managing in Egypt where he was very successful.\n\nThen there was Mr Docherty, who was certainly an old Brentford favourite.\n\nHe did totally the opposite to Mike Everitt, bringing in lots of ball players, and getting rid of the hard boys.\n\nAs for now, I think our Bees have got just the right blend and I hope everyone from the fans upwards, and everyone associated with the club will be just a little more patient because for once we are going in the right direction, although as you know, football changes so quickly.\n\nAfter a couple of unsuccessful appointments the club finally got it right with Bill Dodgin, an experienced coach and manager with four promotions under his belt, and a man whose father had managed the club in the 1950’s.\n\nHe took over a club at a low ebb and going rapidly into free-fall.\n\nGradually he imbued the team with confidence and introduced an attractive style of play underpinned by the dynamism of Jackie Graham in midfield and the hard running, bravery and innate goal scoring ability of Sweetzer.\n\nHe began to bring in talented young players who could pass the ball, such as David Carlton and, a real favourite of mine, John Bain and he hit the jackpot when he stole a surly disaffected underachiever from his former club, Northampton Town.\n\nSteve Phillips repaid the derisory fee paid for him with thirty-two league goals and his partnership with a rejuvenated Andy McCullough, with the pair of them fed chances by the ebullient winger, Doug Allder, ensured that promotion was won to the Third Division.\n\nDodgin was a football purist who was worshipped by his players who he treated like grown ups.\n\nThey were allowed to slip the leash from time to time and rewarded him with their devotion and unstinting efforts on the pitch.\n\nHe was unorthodox and often backed a hunch.\n\nA rampant Gordon Sweetzer ran amok one Saturday afternoon and scored a hat trick against Torquay. We all shook our heads in amazement when he signed the Torquay centre half the following week, but Pat Kruse became a Brentford legend, a footballing centre half despite being well under six feet tall, he formed an effective defensive partnership with the even smaller Paul Shrubb, who read the game brilliantly.\n\nDodgin had an eye for a player and his signings were generally on the money with the exception of one major aberration when the tiny Tony Funnell was brought in at vast cost to spearhead our attack, a task totally beyond him.\n\nAfter a slow start to the 1978/79 Third Division campaign, a superb second half of the season raised hopes of another promotion to follow and Dodgin rejected an offer to join Chelsea as assistant manager, in retrospect a mistake on his part.\n\nAlthough the new season started in great fashion, results declined after Christmas to such an extent that in March 1980, with relegation looking distinctly likely, the board gave Dodgin leave of absence and dispensed with his services a few weeks later.\n\nA poor reward for such an excellent servant to the club.\n\nIronically it was the misfit, Tony Funnell, who finally came good and scored the winner against Millwall that kept the Bees up.\n\nFred Callaghan took over and we will talk more about him next time.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI was reading through some old Brentford programmes from the 60s the other day and saw a note congratulating Gordon Phillips on making his debut for the club in an FA Cup match against Margate.\n\nNothing really out of the ordinary, apart from the fact that the article revealed that after the arrival of Joe Crozier in 1937 Brentford only played nine different goalkeepers between then and the mid 60s.\n\nA quite remarkable record when you consider how regularly teams change players, as well as how often goalkeepers get hurt.\n\nFor the record, throughout that thirty year period the Bees fielded Joe Crozier, Ted Gaskell, Reg Newton, Sonny Feehan, Alf Jefferies, Gerry Cakebread, Fred Ryecraft, Chic Brodie and Gordon Phillips.\n\nWhat is even stranger is that the last four named played in successive games in 1963.\n\nHow often can a club have had different goalkeepers in four consecutive matches?\n\nI certainly cannot think of any other examples and wonder if anybody else can?\n\nJoe Crozier was unobtrusive and a model of consistency and was a key part of the Brentford team that took the First Division by storm in the late thirties.\n\nWhat a bargain he was as he was signed for only one thousand pounds.\n\nHe played three wartime International matches for Scotland, conceding eight goals against England on his debut, and yet he kept his place for the next game.\n\nShades of Frank Haffey at Wembley in 1961 perhaps?\n\nAfter his retirement from football Crozier became managing director of Cory Lighterage and a Freeman of the City of London.\n\nI have previously written about Gerry Cakebread and how he combined a career with the Admiralty with his football commitments.\n\nHe was the undisputed first choice for nearly a decade, and played one hundred and eighty-seven games in a row between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1955 Gerry was named as reserve goalkeeper in the England Under 23 squad to Coventry City’s Reg Matthews.\n\nTwo players from the Third Division were recognised as the most promising young goalkeepers in the country.\n\nIt could never happen today.\n\nReg went on to win full International caps, but hindered perhaps by his part time status, Gerry didn’t, but many supporters think that he was the finest goalkeeper they have seen play for the club.\n\nRemarkably, in his last season at Griffin Park, with his career winding down, Gerry was allowed to take a leave of absence of nearly a month to visit Russia for an extended business trip.\n\nCan you see any manager granting a player similar permission today?\n\nHe also had a long and successful career after football and was awarded an OBE in 1995 for his work on Hydrographics at the Ministry of Defence.\n\nFred Ryecraft was his patient understudy from 1959-1964 and from the look of him he would appear to have spent much of his spare time eating and training in the local Wimpy Bar rather than in the gym, as he was a portly figure to say the very least, and was known to eagerly accept, if not solicit, sweets proffered by young supporters standing behind his goal.\n\nHe is the nearest that Brentford have ever come to Fatty Foulke, and quite how he ever managed to get his massive frame off the ground hardly bears thinking about.\n\nHe certainly filled the goal but, in truth, loyal deputy that he was, he wasn’t really up to the standard required and drifted off to Gravesend where he was also known to play at centre forward.\n\nHe wasn’t alone in that feat as Luton goalkeeper Tony Read was converted into a striker during the 1965/66 season and scored an impressive twelve goals in only twenty games, including a match-winning hat-trick against Notts County, before he ran out of goals and was moved back to his original position.\n\nTalk about lack of gratitude!\n\nChic Brodie was a wonderful servant to the club and was calm and composed in everything he did on the pitch.\n\nHe was an old style goalkeeper, nothing ruffled him, and he was consistent and totally lacking in flamboyance.\n\nHe was also one of the last goalkeepers I can remember who rarely, if ever, seemed to wear gloves.\n\nThose were the days when keepers simply spat on the palm of their hands and hoped that the ball would stick.\n\nMisfortune seemed to follow Chic around throughout his career.\n\nHe is best remembered for conceding nine goals to a rampant Ted MacDougall when playing for Margate, and, of course, for the notorious incident when a stray dog ran full tilt into his knee at Colchester practically ending his professional career.\n\nTed MacDougall has a clear recollection of poor Chic Brodie:\n\nThe keeper always said he thought he was the unluckiest goalkeeper in football.\n\nHe said one day he went to put his flat cap on for a game because it was sunny and he found a hand grenade in it.\n\nThen when he was playing for Brentford a Jack Russell ran on the pitch and smacked him on the leg and nearly broke it.\n\nThen, during another game, the crossbar broke and fell on his head.\n\nAnd then to top it off, I scored nine goals against him.\n\nChic suffered his final tragedy when he died far too young, but he was a skilled craftsman and, ever vigilant, he will always live long in my memory.\n\nGordon Phillips was a local prospect who was initially behind Brodie in the pecking order given his age and lack of experience, but he made the goalkeeping position his own in 1966 for a couple of years, and he and Chic vied for the first team spot in the late 60s with first one coming out on top, and then, the other, and it was not until Chic’s retirement that Gordon became the undisputed first choice.\n\nGiven our customary lack of resources, Gordon was also named as an outfield substitute at Crewe in September 1970, but his services were not called upon on the night.\n\nGordon was an ever present in the 1971/72 promotion team and enjoyed a wonderful season, but things soon turned sour with Brentford suffering the ignominy of relegation at the end of the following season and Gordon’s time at the club was over.\n\nWhere Chic was solid and consistent, Gordon was smaller, slighter and more dynamic in his approach.\n\nGiven his lack of height, he struggled with crosses, but he compensated with his speed of thought and reaction, acrobatic shot stopping and his ability to snuff out danger by diving fearlessly at opponents’ feet.\n\nAnother local boy, Paul Priddy, still an amateur, succeeded Gordon, but after an up and down couple of years he was replaced by Steve Sherwood who achieved the rare feat for a loanee of being ever present in the 1974/75 season and also being voted Player of the Year.\n\nWe apparently made a pretty feeble effort to sign him on a permanent basis, but Watford outbid us by shelling out a mere five thousand pounds.\n\nInstead of buying a promising young keeper who would end up playing in the Football League until he was forty, we ended up taking a four thousand pound gamble that unfortunately did not pay off and totally backfired.\n\nThat was Brentford to a T!\n\nBill Glazier had a long and distinguished career at the top level, playing over four hundred and fifty games for Crystal Palace and Coventry City and three times for the England Under 23 team.\n\nHe was only thirty-two when he was persuaded to put off his retirement and sign for Brentford, but he seemed to be far more interested in running his hotel in Brighton than in keeping the ball out of the Brentford net.\n\nHe was distracted, commuted from the South Coast, and seemed to lack commitment.\n\nHis performances were poor, culminating in an appalling and costly fumble that led to Brentford conceding a soft equaliser at Old Trafford just when it appeared that the Bees might be on the verge of pulling off a massive League Cup giant killing.\n\nHe soon shuffled off into retirement and Paul Priddy seized his opportunity and played for a couple of seasons without ever totally convincing either his manager or the supporters that he was the long term answer to our goalkeeping problem.\n\nHe had one unforgettable afternoon at Vicarage Road when he was unbeatable and touched by genius, saving two penalties and single-handedly earning Brentford a rare victory at Watford.\n\nOn other days he was less authoritative and consistent and Bill Dodgin, perhaps harshly, released him in 1977.\n\nAnother local boy who so nearly made it, but not quite.\n\nPaul wouldn’t take “no” for an answer and even managed to sneak back for a third spell at the club as reserve goalkeeper in 1981, playing one farewell match against Chester, when he signed off with a clean sheet, before having a long and successful career as a well-respected goalkeeping coach.\n\nThe cheque book then came out and Dodgin paid Bristol City eight thousand pounds for Len Bond, and he repaid us with three good years of consistent and brave goalkeeping, before falling out with Fred Callaghan and leaving the club.\n\nWe made a profit on him, but his leaving was a real shame as he was still in his prime, and he subsequently had a long spell at Exeter, but he was stretchered off on a return visit to Griffin Park before being the largely blameless recipient of Brentford’s seven goal salvo at Exeter in 1983.\n\nBrentford’s last goalkeeper of the 70s was Trevor Porter, a last minute emergency replacement when Bond was injured in a car crash, just before the start of the 1978/79 season.\n\nPorter was an old friend of Paul Shrubb, and had also played under Bill Dodgin at Fulham, and we rescued him from oblivion at Slough Town for a fee of seven hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nHe lasted for a couple of seasons and did a steady, unobtrusive job when called upon, and, when he wasn’t, he kept up his previous career as a window cleaner.\n\nSo, Brentford fielded a variety of goalkeepers in the 60s and 70s, some good, some indifferent, but the only real shocker I can remember was Garry Towse, a talented all-round sportsman in his own right, but an average goalkeeper at best, who signed for the club from Crystal Palace and was in goal on that sad October afternoon in 1973 when Brentford conceded four goals in the opening seventeen minutes at Scunthorpe, and sank to the bottom of the Football League for the first time in their history.\n\nThe only way from there was up and I will reminisce about Brentford’s goalkeepers from the 80s and 90s in the near future.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWho can tell me what the following figures refer to?\n\nSorry there are no prizes on offer though!\n\n33%\n\n69%\n\n54%\n\n57%\n\nNo ideas?\n\nOK, I will put you all out of your misery.\n\nThese figures represent the percentage of penalty kicks that we have actually managed to score over the past four seasons.\n\nWoeful aren’t they?\n\nTo put a bit of flesh on the bones:\n\nIn 2010/11 we managed to score a princely three out of the nine penalties we were awarded.\n\nI really cannot bring myself to say anything more about that pathetic record.\n\nThe following season we scored eight of our first nine, and even when Gary Alexander missed, Niall McGinn managed to score from the rebound away at Colchester.\n\nThen it all went pear shaped and we missed two of the next four kicks including the fiasco at Stevenage when we threw away our last chance to reach the Playoffs when Donaldson and Saunders both hit the woodwork rather than the back of the net.\n\nAll in all, though, nine out of thirteen (plus McGinn’s effort) represented an adequate, if not startling success rate.\n\nThe last two seasons have been appalling.\n\nWe managed to only score seven out of thirteen in 2012/13, culminating in Marcello Trotta’s epic failure in the promotion decider against Doncaster.\n\nLast season we actually improved, and scored eight out of fourteen penalty kicks, a figure that was indelibly tarnished once Alan Judge took over the job late in the season and missed three out of his four efforts.\n\nConfusingly enough what also has to be taken into consideration is our perfect record of six out of six successes in the promotion playoffs and shootout in 2013 – where we excelled in high pressure situations.\n\nGo figure!\n\nThere really is no rational explanation.\n\nWhat also is interesting is just how many penalty kicks we have been awarded since Uwe Rosler and Mark Warburton have taken charge at the club.\n\nForty penalty kicks coming our way in the past three seasons just highlights how attacking we are and the success we have in getting quick players to run at the opposition in their penalty area.\n\nSome of the individual penalty records of our players also merit comment.\n\nKevin O’Connor has scored nineteen times in twenty-four attempts and has taken more penalties than any other Brentford player since 1970.\n\nPretty decent but still only a 79% success rate.\n\nStephen Hunt was very reliable and but for a great save from Kuipers would have notched an almost unprecedented hat trick of penalties against Brighton and in total scored twelve out of fifteen.\n\nSteve Phillips started well but incredibly missed his last four kicks yet somehow managed to keep hold of the job until he left the club.\n\nPaul Evans too only missed once and memorably scored an arrogant dinked “Panenka” kick against Oldham back in 2001.\n\nStan Bowles had the most casual approach, swaggering up to the spot, before dummying the keeper as well as the crowd behind the goal with nonchalant ease and rolling the ball into the corner.\n\nI never worried when Stan took the kicks and what amazes me is that he actually missed one of his twelve kicks.\n\nClass, total class.\n\nBack in the 70s Terry Johnson was a perfect seven out of seven and Roger Cross never missed either.\n\nBobby Ross, my first Brentford hero won us promotion in 1972 with a perfect penalty kick against Exeter.\n\nI remember Bill Dodgin going ballistic on the touchline when Andy McCulloch was invited by his team mates to notch his hat trick with a late penalty kick against Tranmere.\n\nHubris triumphed as the keeper smothered his weak effort.\n\nI remember Peter Gelson blasting a vital last minute spot kick against Aldershot into Brook Road and Steve Butler almost hitting the corner flag against Chesterfield.\n\nHorrid, horrid memories!\n\nHow about Andy Sinton who was entrusted with a last minute penalty kick on his Brentford debut against Bury and showed nerves of steel by slotting in the winning goal?\n\nIn more recent times Adam Forshaw scored five out of six last season by varying his approach yet he always looked like missing his second attempt at Peterborough where it was patently obvious to all observers that he had no plan for how to take a second kick in the same game.\n\nClayton Donaldson started with a successful kick at Preston before his crucial miss at Stevenage.\n\nHe also totally failed to hit the target with his last two gruesome efforts at Scunthorpe and Crawley where his pathetic first minute attempt that skewed wide of Paul Jones’s post earned me an immediate red card from our living room as my barrage of choice epithets was not well received by my wife or, indeed, the dog.\n\nOne of them growled menacingly at me, and – no – it wasn’t the dog.\n\nSome missed penalties have a knock-on effect on the player’s career.\n\nWho can say how Will Grigg’s season would have gone if he had managed to mark his home debut with a hat trick against Sheffield United – maybe he would have scored twenty goals and would now be looking forward to starting a new season in the Championship at Griffin Park instead of slumming it at the Moo Camp?\n\nWhat about Paul Hayes?\n\nWould he have gained some much needed confidence had he scored that penalty he missed against Yeovil soon after he came on as a substitute on his debut?\n\nMaybe he too would have gone on to justify Uwe Rosler’s faith in him?\n\nThe margin between success and failure in football is so narrow.\n\nIn these cases no wider than the length of a goalkeeper’s arm.\n\nSam Saunders too, for all his dead ball prowess, obviously finds it easier to score from twenty-five yards out rather than twelve as his meagre 40% penalty kick success rate indicates.\n\nHis costly miss at Sheffield United in 2013 also seems to have slipped under the radar and escaped censure given the euphoria after our last minute equaliser.\n\nI really do not know whether the best approach is the side foot, as exemplified by Bowles, or the Martin Grainger thunderbolt.\n\nBoth were pretty much equally successful.\n\nAs for why our recent record is so poor, heaven only knows as players like Trotta, Saunders, Forrester and Judge are all excellent strikers of a ball – sorry Clayton, but anyone on the Ealing Road terrace who was forced to spend much of the prematch shooting practice ducking Clayton’s misdirected slices as they screamed into the crowd would agree that he wasn’t the cleanest striker of a football.\n\nMaybe there is such a feeling of confidence that we believe that we are bound to score goals anyway and needn’t pay too much attention to penalty kicks?\n\nPerhaps with forty such awards in the past three seasons there is a subconscious feeling that if we miss one there is bound to be another one coming our way fairly shortly?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\nI don’t want to hex the current Adam Forshaw saga but it would appear likely that we will be looking for a new penalty taker next season.\n\nAllan McCormack and Andre Gray have both scored from the spot, as, more memorably, did Harlee Dean and Tony Craig in the Swindon Shootout.\n\nKevin O’Connor, I fear, is unlikely to figure enough in the first team to merit consideration.\n\nJonathan Douglas followed Leo Roget’s example by hitting his effort at Barnet into the stratosphere so is unlikely to figure high on Mark Warburton’s list.\n\nMy money is currently on Alex Pritchard unless we bring in a new striker who qualifies.\n\nI predict that the number of penalty kicks we receive next season with be less than half that of last year, but given that I am sure that every goal will count next season, we will score a far higher proportion of them.\n\nLet’s hope that this is not a jinx!\n\nIn passing many, many thanks to my friend and fellow Bees author, Mark Croxford for providing all the facts that I have mangled in this article!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
