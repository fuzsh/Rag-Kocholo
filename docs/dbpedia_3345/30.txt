The ex-Notts County manager made nearly 200 appearances in the Football League.

Born in South Shields, he joined Burnley as a junior and moved to Albion in 1962, scoring 18 goals in 66 appearances for the Baggies.

The inside forward later played for Birmingham City and then Brentford.

After finishing his playing career, he joined the coaching staff at Notts County.

When boss Jimmy Sirrel moved to Sheffield United in 1975, he became Magpies manager for two years before being replaced by Sirrel on his return to Meadow Lane.

After leaving the Magpies, Fenton joined Nottingham Forest, where he spent 10 years on the coaching staff and a further six as assistant manager under Clough.
