        "text": "WATERTOWN, New York (WWNY)\n\nI recently attended a screening of Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979) for the 45th anniversary. Yikes, 45 years-how can a movie that seems so modern and contemporary be nearly a half century old? I am ancient, but even I wasn’t old enough to attend this sci-fi horror classic when it was first released. It’s difficult to be objective with a film that is undoubtedly part of the sci-fi cannon, with its infamous scenes and indelible terrifying images. However, I hadn’t seen the entire film on the big screen before, so the experience was new for me.\n\nIt’s the collaboration of great artists understanding and working toward a singular vision that makes a good film great. Here, it is the melding of the production design, the sound, the score (yeah Jerry Goldsmith!), the special effects, the editing, and a fantastic cast. Of course, Ridley Scott pulls it all together. Watching it again, I was surprised at how little onscreen violence and gore there is. Much like Jaws (1975) that preceded this film by four years, terror and dread is built by what is unseen, what is imagined. Something is on the ship! As the film progresses the feeling of being trapped and the need to escape escalates, the screen seems to grow smaller, and the interiors get narrower.\n\nIn a pre-screening interview with Ridley Scott, who is now 86 years old, he mentioned some great behind the scenes trivia. To give the illusion of a set being enormous he put his children in spacesuits, shifting the scale in the frame. The casting of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is also something of a legend. Scott claims Warren Beatty saw Weaver in an off-Broadway play and was so taken with her that he mentioned her to Scott. Knowing Beatty, he was probably checking her out for other reasons, not just because she was a very good actress.\n\nThe transformation and evolvement of Weaver’s Ripley as she becomes the real hero, the “boss” that drives the action, slowing gaining confidence and a kick ass attitude out of necessity, out of the desire to survive- is one of the films greatest pleasures. Concurrently you can “feel” that Weaver is gaining confidence as an actress, and by the end of the film she is a movie star who will be renowned for her strong in charge characters.\n\nRewatching Alien on the big screen I was immersed in the film’s astonishing production design. I felt thematically there was a great deal of visual commentary on the mechanical, industrial world run by machines and big corporations. There are references to the cast vying for bonuses and the “company” dictating their every move. The alien itself with its metallic sheen resembles a machine and not a living being at all. When it menacingly appears from within the spaceship it looks like it just emerges from a wall, like an animal that has natural camouflage in high grass, or trees. This highlights the concept that humans can never escape from industry and machines."
