The fan-favorite actress is in talks to join director Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian & Grogu movie!\n\nThere are no details on who she would play in the movie, but it would be pretty awesome if she actually ended up officially being cast in the movie.\n\nAll we know about the movie is that it will pick up in the aftermath of The Mandalorian Season 3. The Mandalorian & Grogu might also be the start of a trilogy that will also include Dave Filoni's untitled movie that will bring this whole New Republic saga together.\n\nFavreau previously shared a statement with the film’s announcement, saying: “I have loved telling stories set in the rich world that George Lucas created. The prospect of bringing the Mandalorian and his apprentice Grogu to the big screen is extremely exciting.”\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Chief Creative Officer Dave Filoni will produce The Mandalorian & Grogu. It will be the first Star Wars film to start production since Episode IX: The Rise of the Skywalker. Thge movie will reportedly shoot this summer.\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu is set to be released on May 22, 2026."
