        "text": "Aliens is my favorite movie. Period. In fact, I prefer the extended/special edition of James Cameron‘s sci-fi epic, a more dramatic take on Ellen Ripley’s story arc in which she learns that her daughter had passed away at the age of 66 after promising to return home for her 11th birthday. It’s brutal and quite literally ties into Ripley’s motivation to save Newt.\n\nIn a new interview with Collider, franchise star Sigourney Weaver was asked which of the Alien films was her favorite to do. Unsurprisingly (at least to this writer), she picks Aliens.\n\n“Oh, goodness, that’s difficult,” exclaimed Weaver. “The best-constructed story for the character to tell was in Aliens, just because Jim [Cameron] has such an amazing sense of structure of story. To take this character out of hyper-sleep, have no one believe her, have her be exiled into this limbo land where no one believes her and her family’s dead. The whole set-up for Ripley in Aliens and then what she ends up doing and what it, finding this new family by the end.\n\n“The whole structure of that story, to me, was gold,” she continued. “I always felt that I could jump up and down on it. It was such a great, supportive, arc for the character. In that sense, the second one for Ripley is probably the most satisfying.”\n\nWho knows, maybe one day Weaver will finally get to see Ripley’s arc come full circle to an actual close?\n\nWhat do you all think? Which would you say is the most satisfying Alien movie?"
