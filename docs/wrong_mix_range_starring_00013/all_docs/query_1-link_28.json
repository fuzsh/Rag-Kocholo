        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nIt's the age old question. When will the Academy honor [insert your legendary favourite here] with an Honorary Oscar? Oscars for actors that excel in genres outside of pure drama always have a more difficult road to industry honors. Michelle Yeoh & Jamie Lee Curtis' recent Oscars were grand exceptions, not the rule! Sigourney Weaver is one of those performers.\n\nThe 73 year old legend's best work has largely been in science-fiction and comedy, traditionally genres that Oscar voters don't think much of in terms of \"acting\". Sigourney Weaver is on the brain due to a \"sizzle reel\" that's going around the web that you should watch after the jump...\n\nWith a career as long as Sigourney's, who made her debut in a bit part in Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) forty-six years ago, there are bound to be some performances missing -- I wanted a little The Year of Living Dangerously, Copycat, Map of the World, and The TV Set for example -- but it's a wonderful edit by Maris Malejs who was commissioned to prepare it last year and has since added in more Ripley. As one would!!!\n\nThat reel is also an unexpected reminder that Sigourney was pretty great in Call Jane, last year's abortion drama.\n\nNext up for Weaver is a wealthy manipulative patron role in Paul Schrader's Master Gardener (she's good but the film unfortunately isn't top tier Schrader) which hits theaters in a couple of weeks. Then she's got a big role in the upcoming Amazon miniseries The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart about an orphaned young girl who moves in with her grandmother (Weaver) who runs a flower farm.\n\nFurther down the road Weaver has a supporting role in the action film The Gorge currently in production which stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy. And then of course there's a bunch more water-logged mo-capped Sigourney in the Avatar series.\n\nWhat is favourite Sigourney Weaver performance aside from her iconic work as Lt. Ellen Ripley?\n\nI'm partial to The Ice Storm and I will also never forget how hilarious she was on Broadway 10 years ago in \"Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike\"\n\nSigourney is my favourite actress hence my user name and i'm sad she hasn't been nominated for 35 years and this clip reel brought a big warm glow to my face.\n\nI've seen all her good and all her bad movies,big or small,lead supporting voice over or cameo,I simply love her.\n\nShe would have 8 nominations 86,88 twice,94,97,99,07 and 2022 in my own awards and 3 wins for Aliens,Working Girl and The Ice Storm\n\nI almost died when she made a surprise final act appearence in Cabin in the Woods,a terrific horror film from 10 yrs ago,\n\nAside from the iconic role in the Alien franchise and funny turns in W/Girl,Galaxy Quest,Heartbreakers and the underseen The TV Set which she's hilarious in,it always frustrates me when people don't recognise what a good dramatic actress she is.\n\nHer best work is across all genres in particular small films like Death and the Maiden,The Ice Storm for which she should have had 97's supporting Oscar,Map of the World,Call Jane etc.\n\nShe was terrific in last years The Good House which I saw just for her but unless you are are Mirren,Dench or Streep it's hard for older actresses films to be recognised.\n\nI would love for her to get a competitive prize just as I hope Pfeiffer does but it's looking less likely.\n\nI was praying she'd knock it out of the park and be nominated for Master Gardner,can't wait to see it.\n\nIn 1988 the Academy didn't realise by not giving Glenn And Sigourney their due that year they really messed up and no honorary will ever make up for it.\n\nI almost feel as though Weaver has been too active in recent years to get the drum beats of an Honorary Oscar going right now. A little distance from media attention seems to get the buzz going, so maybe in a few years, after the last of the Avatar sequels, Weaver will get more consideration. Meanwhile, Glenn Close, who is 2 and half years older than Weaver, has those recent competitive losses and not much else since to keep her top of mind for the Governors, so, if anyone of that generation of actresses will get the push, it'll more likely be Close. And my favorite performances from Weaver are her comedies (from the Ghostbusters movie and Working Girl to Dave, Galaxy Quest, Heartbreakers, and You Again, she always elevates what could be forgettable material) and her television work in Snow White: A Tale of Terror, Prayers for Bobby, and Political Animals (all of which deserved more attention). I have yet to see A Map of the World and most of her smaller independent movies and hope she still gets some great movie roles in the years ahead.\n\nWow! What a great sizzle reel! And yes, it could have been 5 times as long.\n\nSigourney Weaver is taken for granted. She’s such exhilarating fun to watch, and so “just right” in every role, that somehow the fact that she’s displaying enormous range doesn’t register. She also lacks (thank god) the pontificating veneer that actors use to announce “I am a Great Actor”.\n\nI love her sparkle, wit, quick pacing, whole hearted engagement, devastating line deliveries, and utter narrative clarity. She wields artistic economy in getting right to the heart of a character and a story.\n\nAnd I love how there’s always something unexpected! Like in “Call Jane” where she’s playing strip poker, you think “wait, what?” and a moment later you’re thinking “god, she’s great”.\n\nOne of my favourites although it is a tiny role (but perfect) is in “Baby Mama” where she plays an entitled character of privilege who is also gifted with luck and good fortune, accepted with a sweetly self congratulatory complacence guaranteed to enrage. Her every line reading is so sharply pointed to Irritate You Beyond Belief. So satisfyingly masterful.\n\nI see an opportunity for the AMPAS to refashion the Honorary Award from an \"oops, our bad, you're old now!\" prize into something that actually means more than the competitive Oscar.\n\nCompetitive wins are often the result of temporary career heat.\n\nLook at the Mark Twain Prize for comedy, for instance. That's recently gone to a lot of people in their 50s and 60s who aren't anywhere near the end of their careers. It's the highest achievement in comedy and nobody thought it was \"too soon\" to bestow on Julia Louis Dreyfus in her late 50s. It's not \"too soon\" to recognize Michelle Pfeiffer or Annette Bening as a master of screen acting, why wouldn't the AMPAS want to do that?"
