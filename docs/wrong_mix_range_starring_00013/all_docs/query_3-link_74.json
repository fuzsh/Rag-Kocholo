        "text": "The first new Star Wars movie since J.J. Abrams’ trilogy capping The Rise of Skywalker to go into production will be Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian & Grogu, and who better to enlist in the film than sci-fi legend Sigourney Weaver?\n\nWeaver was, of course, the face of the Alien franchise as Ellen Ripley and one of the first true female action stars, having gone face-to-multiple-faces (and mouths) with Xenomorphs in Ridley Scott’s iconic 1979 sci-fi horror film Alien and James Cameron’s equally iconic 1986 Aliens (Weaver was featured in two more Aliens films after that, including David Fincher’s Aliens 3). Weaver’s sci-fi bonafides also include James Cameron’s Avatar and recent Avatar: The Way of the Water, with more Avatars on the way. Now, she’s in talks to join Favreau’s The Mandalorian & Grogu, which is expected to go into production later this year.\n\nFavreau famously brought Mando and Grogu to the small screen with Disney+’s The Mandalorian, the first live-action Disney series ever, a stellar western-flavored action adventure that followed the titular Mandalorian, aka Djarin (Pedro Pascal), a brilliant bounty hunter who is tasked with retrieving some valuable cargo. That cargo turned out to be the baby alien that set the internet on fire. Grogu, also known as Baby Yoda, was a curious creature with great powers that Mando took on as simply another bounty to collect, but who became a surrogate son. Mando and Grogu’s bond has become undeniable in three seasons, and now their adventures are headed to the big screen. There’s no word yet where on the timeline The Mandalorian & Grogu will be set and how it will pick up from the series.\n\nSince The Mandalorian bowed on Disney+, a slew of new live-action Star Wars series have premiered, including The Book of Boba Fett, Andor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka. More series are being developed, including Skeleton Crew and The Acolyte, Leslye Headland’s upcoming series, which is slated for a June 2, 2024 release.\n\nPascal is expected to return as Djarin, although figuring out his schedule will be challenging, considering he’s set to start shooting Marvel’s The Fantastic Four at the end of July.\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu will be produced by Favreau, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, and Ahsoka creator and Star Wars guru Dave Filoni.\n\n“Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have ushered into Star Wars two new and beloved characters, and this new story is a perfect fit for the big screen,” Kennedy said in a statement when the film was announced.\n\nFavreau’s film will be the first of a few new Star Wars movies, which include films by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, which will center on a post-Rise of Skywalker Rey (Daisy Ridley), James Mangold’s mysterious film, and another film by Filoni.\n\nThere are Star Wars films slated for May 22, 2026, December 18, 2026, and December 17, 2027, although calendars are always subject to change.\n\nFor more on Star Wars, check out these stories:\n\n“Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace” has Big Re-Release to Celebrate 25th Anniversary\n\nJames Mangold’s “Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi” Film Taps “House of Cards” Creator Beau Willimon as Co-Writer\n\nDarkness Rises in “The Acolyte” Trailer, Revealing a New Kind of “Star Wars” Series\n\nDisney+’s New “Star Wars” Series “The Acolyte” Unveils Premiere Date"
