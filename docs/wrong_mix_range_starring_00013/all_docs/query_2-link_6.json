        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nOverall thoughts on her as an actress? Her Oscar-nominated performances? Where would she rank for you in the pantheon of American actresses (Close, Lange, Streep, etc.)?\n\nI think she has one of the most wonderful voices of any actor, ever - as beautifully evidenced by her virtuoso narration of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales - I so loved watching these as a child, and when I worked at the YMCA, I shared them with the kids there - I was kind of surprised by how engaged today's children were by these short videos. Testament to Weaver's power, no doubt.\n\nI like all of her nominated performances - she'd have made a fine winner for each - I'd probably rank them:\n\n1. Aliens\n\n2. Gorillas in the Mist\n\n3. Working Girl\n\nAnd of course she's terrific in The Ice Storm. I haven't seen Death and the Maiden, but the prospect of her being directed by Polanski is really quite intriguing - do you recommend the film?\n\nPlease do share your thoughts/recommendations!\n\nPost by ibbi on\n\nThere was definitely something in the water in 1949 that resulted in the births of so many great actresses, particularly in the USA, and for me she is the best one out of all of them (the American ones, Fanny Ardant over everyone). Can make absolutely anything work. I finally realized she was God almighty when the crap she had to say in Avatar seemed natural as a rainy day.\n\nPost by bob-coppola on\n\nShe is so underrated, I see a lot of people mentioning Lange and Close as the best of their generations, but in my opinion, Weaver has always been better than those two. Her work in Death and the Maiden is so brutal and disturbingly great.\n\nPost by taranofprydain on\n\nShe does have a strong voice with a very strikibg quality about it, all but vouched for by the running joke in Finding Dory last year, where many of the animated characters were transfixed by it.\n\nAnd she has impressive range as an actress. She made that thankless part in Working Girl much livlier , she was pinpoint accurate in The Ice Storm, completely convincing in Gorillas in the Mist, added layers of nuance to a horror/action role in Aliens, and was hilarious in Galaxy Quest.\n\nPost by ingmarhepburn on\n\nI love her. She always looks so confident on screen, and her performances are, more often than not, effortless and natural. I also agree with you about her voice.\n\nShe's my Best Actress winner in 1986 for Aliens and in 1988 for Gorillas in the Mist. I also love her performances in comedies such as Ghostbusters and Heartbreakers. I still need to see Working Girl and The Ice Storm.\n\nShe's reason enough for me to watch a film without knowing anything else about it.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nHappy 70th Birthday!\n\nI predict we're gonna see a comeback of sorts next decade. At least I hope so! - she's currently filming The Good House opposite Kevin Kline - in a role Streep almost did, produced by Jane Rosenthal (having a huge 2019 - When They See Us, The Irishman), to be distrib'd by Universal. And I think it's only a matter of time before she grabs a great TV gig.\n\nProbably in my Top 30 fav actresses - I agree with stephen that she's overlooked among the more praised of her gen - I kinda prefer her on-screen over Lange, Close, etc. She's badass obviously her Ripley is iconic and I like her whole series, quite underrated in comedy though, she can be great fun - Heartbreakers, Galaxy Quest, Ghostbusters, and across a lot of her work she has an alluring, conspiratorial, sexy quality. She can play it straight too - she's pretty good in the lame melodramas A Map of the World, Imaginary Heroes... or dig deeper into troubled characters, Copycat, or especially the phenomenal Death and the Maiden. The Ice Storm is a great, subtle stir of a perf, and Working Girl while the adversary she somehow emerged, for me, as the one I felt most sorry for. Several other perfs I like too and some I've yet to see like Gorillas and her TV work.\n\nPost by avnermoriarti on\n\nOne of those actors for whom I’d watch anything they’re part of, even in the tiniest of parts, what about her cameo in Finding Dory ? ❤️❤️ Last time I saw one of her films was The Assignment, where she plays a b-movie crazy doctor, and of course, she delivers.\n\nPost by Tommen_Saperstein on\n\nAn absolute badass. Had a lot of great roles in the 80s and 90s of strong, complicated, or downright bitchy women (Working Girl!! ). Among the best of her generation Not better than Streep because lol no one is, and maybe not better than Sarandon either but definitely in that upper echelon. I think I prefer her to Lange and I know I prefer her to Pfeiffer.\n\nmy favorite performances:\n\n1. Alien/Aliens (1979 has the definite edge but between these two films she established herself as the greatest female action hero ever, strike that: one of the greatest action heroes period)\n\n2. Working Girl\n\n3. The Ice Storm\n\n4. The Year of Living Dangerously\n\nHappy birthday queen"
