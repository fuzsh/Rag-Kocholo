        "text": "From the same director as Blade Runner, we have the story of Moses and his leading of the Hebrew people from Egypt. It’s no action film like Gladiator (which is certainly better) nor Noah (which is comparable on different fronts), the former of which was directed by Ridley Scott. Primarily for the reason of a lackluster central character, this film falls quite a bit.\n\nOne of things this movie has going for it is the story is very good. It’s fast-paced for the majority it but there certainly are lulls. Likely a strike against the film when considering general audiences but this film does carry with it a hefty runtime of 150 minutes. Fortunately, the Gorehound loves longer movies as it allows more time of entertainment and story. The Gorehound’s favorite scenes were of the locusts, frogs, etc., bravo!\n\nThe actors do not fit their roles. None of the characters are of any middle-eastern descent. The Gorehound is not a fan of Christian Bale for a few reasons including his angry rant and his depiction of Batman, nor does the Gorehound think he is attractive in any way. Sigourney Weaver really does not fit her role. Another aggravation is the characters use of english. This really prevents the Gorehound from delving into the story. It would be one thing if the story had a different take, but it’s nearly taken straight from the bible, without alteration. Noah told the story from the bible and more, taking a different perspective and therefore allowing more liberties to be taken.\n\nDirected by one of the best directors ever (strictly Gorehound’s opinion), Ridley Scott, this flick is very pretty. The visuals and scenes are worthy. The music fits right in. In a category of scenery and sets, this is an 5/5, but unfortunately for this flick, too much goes astray.\n\nThe plagues and locusts were so well done because they seemed so natural, as it likely would have happened. The events aren’t magical, but rather natural. With a person serving as a scientist in that time to explain, what they believe to be happening, the audience can see the Egyptians trying to understand and combat the will of God.\n\nThe character’s personalities aren’t truthful. Moses and Ramses don’t act like brothers, Moses and his wife don’t act like spouses. I know this is ancient history but I don’t see the point of bringing so much attention to these relationships when it doesn’t really matter.\n\nDespite the plethora of bad reviews, the Gorehound gave this movie a chance. It’s got the director and story going for it, but lacks fitting characters and fails to intertwine the script, story, and characters. 2/5\n\n2012’s Prometheus, Ridley Scott’s return to the Alien-universe after a 30+ year hiatus, managed to do many things wrong and only a few things right. Prometheus featured an amazing, groundbreaking viral marketing campaign, which ultimately contributed to its 50 million dollar+ opening weekend. It gave us Michael Fassbender’s David character, another great android in a film series full of great androids (Ash in Alien, Bishop in Aliens, less so with Call in Alien: Resurrection). Prometheus also looked fantastic – the production design, special effects, creature work, and cinematography were absolutely stunning. The film is beautiful to look at, even if there’s not much beyond the surface. It’s no surprise it was nominated for an Academy Award for its special effects.\n\nBut Prometheus never held up as a good movie – not even in my initial viewing did I think it was particularly good. It is an entirely unnecessary film filled with bad writing and middling-performances (Logan Marshall-Green is terrible in it, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are utterly pointless to the main story). It contradicts its own science and logic in several places, and has characters act foolishly simply to advance the plot (the less said about the two guys getting lost in the caves the better). Recently, yet another film in the long-running Alien franchise has been announced, and I strongly feel that Prometheus should serve as a cautionary tale for the upcoming, still-in-pre-development Alien “mid-boot,” to be directed by South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium).\n\nBack in January, Blomkamp strategically leaked several works of concept art for an Alien film he thought about making one time. Of course, the Internet went nuts. Blomkamp is most famous for directing 2009’s Best Picture nominee (yep, that happened) District 9, a solid science fiction film shot on the relative cheap that featured an amazing performance by Sharlto Copley and made a ton of money worldwide. Blomkamp followed that film up with Elysium, one of the worst wide-released films of 2013. Elysium is so dumb that it gives me a headache just thinking about it. Really, nothing in that movie succeeds, not in its sophomoric politics or in its bad performances (Jodie Foster is particularly egregious). It was arguably the worst written big budget movie of 2013. I’m not sure where Chappie, Blomkamp’s latest movie, will lie in film history, but pre-release buzz isn’t great.\n\nA few weeks after that initial leak, Blomkamp announced via social media that he was on tap to direct the latest Alien film based solely on his ideas and concept art. The film, as yet untitled, would go into production after Prometheus 2, a sequel none of us want (I have to imagine that soon we’ll get the news that Prometheus 2 will be sidelined and Blomkamp’s Alien film will get production priority). And then, the floodgates opened up. Almost immediately, Blomkamp came out and said that his film will ignore the events of Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. This was met with mixed results. Neither the third nor the fourth Alien sequel is on par with the first two, but each has its defenders. I love Alien 3 and think it is quite underrated. I will not go to bat for Resurrection, which I find terrible (though because it was written by Joss Whedon, it has its share of frothing-rage fanboys at the ready to defend it).\n\nAnd then, Blomkamp came out to clarify his remarks. He said that the new film won’t ignore the events of Alien 3 and Resurrection, but it will instead be more in the spirit of the first two films. Now is the time when I break it to Blomkamp that Alien and Aliens are completely different movies all together, with the first being a horror film and the second being an action film. So let’s recap this: Blomkamp strategically leaks Alien-related concept art via social media, is later announced as the architect of a new Alien film based solely on a few images he created, immediately puts his foot in his mouth regarding the events of the third and fourth films in the series, then dials that statement back. Yes, we are in the earliest of the early pre-production stages, but how is this anything other than a three-ring circus at this point?\n\nThere’s also something else to consider here – something that people might not want to hear. We don’t need another Alien movie, even if it is directed by Blomkamp. We’ve had six of them if you count the Alien vs. Predator franchise, and seven if you count Prometheus. There hasn’t been a quality Alien film since at least 1992, and even that’s debatable. Most people would probably say 1986. So really, other than audience familiarity, what is the point of bringing this franchise back to the big screen once again? Blomkamp has created three original science fiction properties thus far, meeting at least some measure of success along the way. Does he really need to become a franchise film director at this point? What is stopping him from creating his own universe of films with malevolent aliens and cool space marines? Why would he limit himself to a film with a set of rules already established? What’s the point?\n\nI understand that nostalgia has a powerful influence on people. I just re-watched Aliens over the weekend in preparation for this write-up. The film is still amazing. It is incredibly long and exhausting, but done so purposefully so the audience essentially feels as tired and stressed as the characters in the movie (this is kind of genius – why is it not done more often?). But Aliens is also nearly 30 years old. Michael Biehn, Sigourney Weaver, and Lance Henriksen are old enough to be grandparents, and probably are. Yes, Alien 3 was a massive creative and financial disappointment in 1992, but there’s no reason to try and correct that now in 2015. Move on from this kind of thing people. Appreciate what we have in life and do something new. Don’t limit yourself, Blomkamp. Elysium wasn’t good, but you’re capable of so much more than just another franchise film. Keep giving us new stuff – don’t give up just yet.\n\n-Z-\n\nOh, Taylor Lautner. He really isn’t that bad of an actor. He is good looking, likeable, and watchable enough. He’s no DeNiro, obviously, but he’s good enough to where he can helm a film and make a decent career for himself post-Twilight. He just needs to pick better projects. The 2011 John Singleton film Abduction is not that.\n\nIt is really, really bad. I wasn’t expecting it to be great. When I started to stream it from Netflix, I figured I’d at least be entertained by a B-level action film. It is not even that. The story and character actions are so nonsensical that I can’t believe that actors such as Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver were willing to sign on to such a turkey. Maybe it was a decent paycheck. Who knows?\n\nIn Abduction, Lautner plays a teen who discovers himself on a missing persons website. Though a series of events, he discovers that his parents are not his parents and that he is the son of a CIA agent who years earlier stole a list of corrupted CIA agents from some terrorist. Now, the terrorist learns of Lautner and plans to kidnap him so dad will return the list. Lautner then has to keep a step ahead of the terrorists and the CIA in order to save himself. Oh, he also has his would-be girlfriend in tow for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThis story makes absolutely no sense. The father has a list of the corrupted agents for, presumably, years. Why didn’t he turn this over to the CIA when he first got it? Why does the terrorist want this list back so badly? Why was Lautner put in a CIA-sponsored foster home to begin with? None of this makes any sense! The movie even runs with the assumption that because Lautner’s dad was the best of the best CIA agent, then, obviously, Lautner is also going to be like that. As far as I know, genetics generally doesn’t work like that.\n\nAlso, if Lautner was living with foster parents for 18 years, how come he didn’t realize this considering that he looks nothing like his parents? Maybe you could get away with that with another actor, but when you have Taylor Lautner (who comes from such a unique ethnic background) and two very Anglo-looking parents, wouldn’t that raise an eyebrow? I know. I know. I’m nitpicking. Maybe if the movie was better…\n\nAll that said, Singleton’s direction is fairly slick. His action sequences are solid and Lautner does have a flair for action. Him sticking to that genre might be a good choice.\n\nThis was a bad film. Laughably bad. It isn’t outright horrid as its watchable, but it almost feels like a parody of this type of teen thriller. Lautner is better than this, and if he really wants to pull in some non-Twilight success and/or acclaim like his co-stars have, he really needs to look over what scripts he is given. I know he can do it. I do!\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn’t look like that will be the case yet. Besides a cameo role in Grown Ups 2, Lautner hasn’t appeared in a non-Twilight film since Abudction. And the next movie he is going to headline is a Premium Rush knock-off with five credited writers attached to it. Sigh. A world without Taylor Lautner is not a world I want to live in.\n\nIn June of 1984 Columbia Pictures released Ghostbusters into theaters, where it became one of the highest grossing films of all time and a beloved 1980s classic. The incredibly talented main cast, including Bill Murray (one of the most beloved actors of all time), Dan Akroyd, Sigourney Weaver (who served as a sort-of Sci Fi queen in the 80s), and Harold Ramis, combined with highly successful director Ivan Reitman to form a zeitgeist seen only a few times per decade at most. The film spawned a hit soundtrack, a glut of merchandising, several tie-in videogames, a long-running cartoon adaptation, and a film sequel, released a half-decade later in 1989.\n\nThough Ghostbusters appeared to be several geniuses coming together to form a super film (and indeed kind of was), the truth is that there were rivalries, arguing, and creative control issues behind the film. Bill Murray was arguably the biggest comedic actor in 1984 (perhaps tied with Eddie Murphy), and famously feuded with Harold Ramis, who co-wrote Ghostbusters with Akroyd (himself another legendary control freak). With Reitman, a rising Hollywood studio director, at the helm, a world-famous actor in Murray on the set, and the creative input of Ramis and Akroyd (who co-starred in addition to writing the thing), three separate creative forces came together in service of the film.\n\nIn the years since Ghostbusters made the approximate gross domestic product of a small country, the fortunes of its primary creative team waned somewhat. Bill Murray took a self-imposed exile from big-budget films. After Ghostbusters, Murray wouldn’t star in a commercial studio release again until 1988’s Scrooged. Even today Murray tends to shun highly visible commercial roles, opting to appear in smaller fare by filmmakers like Wes Anderson. Reitman would go on to direct Legal Eagles, one of the most expensive films ever made at that point in time. The film was not a box office success and generated poor reviews from critics. Akroyd found some measure of success as he wrote and starred in middling box office hits like Dragnet and Spies Like Us, but none of these had the lasting culture cache of Ghostbusters. Lastly, Ramis’ lone notable credit was as a part of Baby Boom, a Diane Keaton vehicle released in 1987.\n\nSo when Columbia came calling about a sequel, the creative team behind Ghostbusters likely should have been ecstatic. The opportunity to go back to the well and milk it for another huge Hollywood success sounds like it would have been awfully appealing. But when Ghostbusters II was released in June of 1989 (just one week before Tim Burton’s Batman, which became a cultural zeitgeist of its own), reviews were negative and audiences responded with a resounding shrug. Roger Ebert, on his nationally broadcast television show with Gene Siskel, noted that he saw it in a packed theater, and only one person laughed during the entire running time of the film. Though it opened with what was at the time a record-breaking weekend, the film ultimately wound up with only 112 million in the United States, or way less than half of what the original grossed five summers earlier.\n\nPerhaps the most angering aspect of Ghostbusters II is just how bad its screenplay is. Presented with an opportunity to knock fans out of their box theater seats, Ramis and Akroyd instead give us pink slime, Peter MacNicol, and an animatronic Statue of Liberty. The film lampoons the nasty, sarcastic nature that is the stereotype of the average New Yorker, playing it lamely into the plot of the film. MacNichol plays Janosz, an effeminate museum worker and art restorer (and also Weaver’s coworker) possessed by the painting of Vigo the Carpathian, an awesomely terrifying portrait that has stood as one of the few positive things about the movie. Vigo, an evil 17th century magician, plans to use the negative energy of New Yorkers to fuel his evil pink slime so that he can possess Peter MacNichol and transfer his own conscience into Sigourney Weaver’s baby and thus be resurrected into the 20th century where I guess he can continue his sorcery and evil.\n\nThe main problem with Ghostbusters II was that it largely re-tread the areas the first film explored, which lead to incredibly diminishing returns. The film also seemed to lose a lot of the bite and edge so apparent in the first product, as it had a much more family-friendly feeling behind it (the film also spawned an absolute ton of tie-in merchandise and toys and the marketing behind it was understandably inescapable). Opening at a children’s birthday party with the embarrassed-looking main cast a flop as entertainers probably wasn’t a wise decision. The addition of a baby to the cast (adding a kid is almost always a deal-breaker) was another bad idea. It was almost like the five years between the films had softened the creative team considerably, as the crass, blue-collar feeling of the first film led to the family-friendly aspirations of the second.\n\nStill hungry for fame, critical attention, and mainstream acceptance upon making the first one, Akroyd, Ramis, and Reitman just looked like paunchy old men by the time the sequel arrived. Even side characters like Rick Moranis’ nerdy Louis Tully and Annie Potts’ funny secretary Janine Melnitz feel shoe-horned in, as if the filmmakers included them only because the audience expected them to return. Only Murray and Weaver escape embarrassment, as the two seem literally too cool for this shit at several moments in the movie. Murray’s long-standing feud with Ramis probably compelled him to just do whatever he wanted in the movie, lending a sort of cavalier, laissez faire feeling to his role (at one point in the film he actually distances himself from the actions of his supposed friends). Weaver is just too awesome to look bad in any movie she’s ever been in.\n\nThe film just isn’t very good, top to bottom. There are noticeable groan-worthy one liners, accented bad guys, a kid-friendly atmosphere, and a ton of bullshit about New Yorkers coming together in peace and harmony to the tune of (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher (ugh!). In many ways Ghostbusters II was a victim of its original incarnation’s massive success. There was absolutely no way that a sequel film would have ever lived up to the mammoth hype the first experienced. A cultural zeitgeist only happens so often. Still, I can’t help but feel that the creative forces behind the film are also heavily to blame. Was this the best that Ramis, Akroyd, and Reitman could do? The best moments in the film are the ones that feel closer in spirit to the original film (the courtroom scene remains a highlight to me), but so much of Ghostbusters II is an unexplainable mess. I can’t imagine why anyone out there is still clamoring for a third film in the franchise. The horse died almost 25 years ago. Let it rest in peace.\n\n-Z-\n\nJames Cameron’s Avatar, released by Fox during the incredibly lucrative 2009 Christmas holiday season (which saw three films top 200 million domestically), is the highest grossing movie of all time, having amassed a haul of over 2.5 billion dollars worldwide during its lengthy run in theaters (I remember going back to see it again in first-run theaters in March 2010, nearly three months after its initial release – this almost never happens anymore). Barring the outside chance that a few highly anticipated and upcoming 2015 tent-poles such as the Man of Steel sequel (unlikely, considering the ceiling of Superman movies thus far), Marvel’s Avengers 2 (which has an outside shot, but may also depend slightly on the reception of Marvel’s Phase 2 films), or J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars VII (which will probably be delayed to 2016) surpasses it, Avatar will likely remain the highest grosser for the foreseeable future. Christmas 2016 is over three years away, and despite some online buzz, I’m wondering if anyone will be left to care much about the Avatar sequels.\n\nIn the past few months, the internet has been abuzz with the news that James Cameron plans to shoot Avatar 2, Avatar 3, and Avatar 4 back-to-back-to-back. A long-standing rumor claims Cameron will set one of the sequels primarily underwater, using his revolutionary deep-sea camera equipment (which was hilariously and fairy accurately lampooned on a 2012 episode of South Park) to film the movie. Main characters Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are slated to reappear as Jake Sully and Neytiri, and rumors have Cameron figuring out a way to have Sigourney Weaver come back as well (spoiler alert for 2009’s biggest movie: Weaver died in the first Avatar). Recent buzz also has Arnold Schwarzenegger in talks to play Avatar 2’s big bad, which sounds completely awesome. Fox almost immediately came out and dispelled those rumors however. We here at the Culture Cast are loathe to talk casting rumors, but the prompt response from Fox probably indicates Schwarzenegger at least took a meeting with Cameron. Casting Arnie as the villain would be a huge coup for the production, as it would re-team the Terminator with Cameron for the fourth time, the previous three collaborations having been mega-successful additions to pop culture. It would also mean high-profile work for Schwarzenegger, and that’s always a good thing.\n\nFox and Cameron would have to do a lot of additional work to get audience interest in any Avatar sequels to the level the original was at back in 2009. Though I love Avatar (it was probably my favorite movie in 2009, considering I saw it in theaters four times and own the 3D Blu Ray, which I bought for an inflated price in 2011 on eBay due to Panasonic having its exclusive rights for years…), audience interest has understandably gone done over the past four years due to numerous factors, which mainly include an enormous backlash against the film and its success. Avatar wasn’t nearly as revolutionary in terms of its script, story, and characters as it was in terms of its use of special effects and 3D camera work, and the biggest knock against it is that it combines properties like Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas into a preachy film about the environment (The Hunger Games saw pretty much the same criticism due to its similarities with other works of fiction by Stephen King and Shirley Jackson, among others). Cameron’s script for the Avatar sequels would have to be a fairly daring work of originality and bravado that built upon the interesting universe established in the first film to draw audiences back in, perhaps even something on the level of The Dark Knight compared to Batman Begins.\n\nBlockbuster filmmaking has arguably changed since Avatar’s 2009 release as well. Gimmicks like IMAX formatting and 3D (especially post-converted 3D) don’t really mean anything anymore. 3D itself has seen a slide into near irrelevance outside of the occasional tent-pole film release. The share of box office grosses for 3D screens continues to shrink throughout the years, hitting the lowest point so far this past summer. The Marvel machine has seemingly dominated the box office in the years since Avatar as well (Iron Man 2, Captain America, Thor, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Captain America 2, The Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers 2, and Ant-Man have either all released or will release before Avatar 2 comes out). DC will counter with the hotly anticipated Man of Steel sequel, where Batman and Superman will finally face off on the big screen for the first time. Universal will launch another Jurassic Park movie in theaters. Michael Bay’s Transformers 4 will hit multiplexes everywhere next summer. The previously mentioned Star Wars sequel will be out. Another Star Trek will probably release, as will another Mission: Impossible film and Sam Mendes’ follow-up to Skyfall. These are properties that continually deliver for audiences, have characters people know and care about, and most importantly don’t have seven year lay-offs the way the proposed Avatar franchise will have by the time part two arrives in 2016. By then, will anyone care anymore unless Cameron really brings it?\n\nI have no doubt that the Avatar sequels will be hits. I just don’t think they’ll arrive with the same kind of cultural gravitas that the original did. I’ve long been a proponent of striking while the iron is hot. This year’s Star Trek Into Darkness is a good example of a sequel coming a bit too late to take advantage of the goodwill of the first film. While Into Darkness was a critical and commercial hit for Paramount, it didn’t have the same kind of legs that Star Trek did when it was released in 2009 (it also faced a much higher level of competition at the box office). A long four year gap and a script that felt duct-taped together somewhat didn’t help anyone either. If Avatar 2 is on track for 2016 (and Cameron has said that it is), then it will have been a very long seven year wait in between films. However, if Avatar 2 is a stupendous achievement not only in technical filmmaking but also in storytelling, then it has a shot. Mark me down as cautiously optimistic.\n\n-Z-\n\nReleased in ’79 before The Gorehound came into existence, H. R. Giger and Ridley Scott had a movie-baby and birthed this outstanding fictional species. I love observing this particular alien in all seven films, and you should too. Not only is the storyline great, but the species, as a biological being, is fascinating. Let’s not forget about Sigourney Weaver, Queen of the sci-fi world either. For she is the proverbial cherry on top in this series. Behold: four reasons why Alien in its entirety is great.\n\n1. The alien is great. Ridley Scott and H. R. Giger are great couple. Giger, a Swedish surrealist, created the actual costuming and design while Scott directed the first film. It’s so beautiful. As a veteran biological studies student in college, I can tell you just what the alien is. It’s the last man standing and overall winner of the game that is Survival of the Fittest. If the alien came to earth, it would kick all of our asses and take over the world. Beyond the physiology of the creature, I’m also impressed with all its other cute little quirks. You know, how it hisses and drools acidic slime. To me, it’s very pumpkinhead-esque. Furthermore, the metamorphosis, lifestory, and grotesqueness are all intense. To briefly describe: an egg is produced by a mother alien (like a queen bee), the facehugger erupts from the egg and attaches itself (parasitically and sexually) upon an organism (humans are not a requirement) and embeds itself within, making a fusion of an alien and of the organism in which it is attached. The baby alien then bursts from the host’s body and grows to be the alien. That’s some crazy shit. This alien drips, has acidic fluids which burn through multiple layers of a spaceship, and is huge and dark. I’d rather not delve into the sexual overtones of the alien species but that goes deep if that’s what you desire.\n\n2. Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) is great. While she is everything short of the stereotypical hottie (No offense Siggy), I believe her to be the most attractive woman in action/sci-fi/horror films. Her ruggedness and toughness are hard to find today in anybody. Michelle Rodriguez or Milla Jovovich? Pssh. Their characters don’t go as deep as we see Siggy go. Indeed, in the original Alien, Ripley’s role was written bias-free, so that a man or woman could play. This started her off as tough. It does help that she has cat, Jonesy, that she loves as much as I love my cat, Peaches. In the sequel, we see Ripley develop and hold a more sensitive role, comforting the annoying Newt/Rebecca, and in the third she shaves her head and well, the director decides to plunge into the sexual tension between a colony of men and Ripley. Possibly the worst of the series but still has the same set and scenery to make it watchable. Regardless, as the series progresses we see Ripley take on a more mother/offspring role and the relationship digs deep to bring an all around synergy to the series. 3. Ridley Scott is great. He directed the first film, Alien, and the latest Prometheus (‘12) and while it may be a personal feeling, I feel that Scott really brings together everything . I don’t know if he’ll add more to the series but he started the legacy on the right foot. Scott also directed Blade Runner (‘82), my all-time favorite movie. His dark futuristic style enthralls me. Scott and Giger together present a possible, and believable, vision of the future. While sci-fi movies rarely predict the future (though they have), they do offer insight as to our current projections.\n\n4. The story is great and concludes why this film is great. This point fuses Ridley Scott’s vision with the alien’s way of life while Ripley provides the icing on the cake. Alien is just like any other organism on Earth. It is trying to live long and prosper, despite its unfavorable (yet necessary) method of parasitism for development. The storyline thrusts Survival of the Fittest into one spaceship.\n\nAlien is great. But while there are seven films where the alien makes an appearance, I do have one bone to pick with the whole thing. I must say that not all the films are respectful to the poor alien. Alien is not a creature to be hunted. He is not to be cheaply recreated by computers for he truly is disgusting, dripping with slime, and holds a domineering presence. While he would love to enslave the entire human race and move onto the next galaxy to, again, live long and prosper, I believe that if we came across facehuggers on (soon to be discovered planet) LV-426, we could domesticate them and keep them as housepets so that my cat, Peaches, can finally have a friend.\n\nWell, I am finally back from my vacation! I am in the watching and writing mood, and I’d like to start out with a critical re-evaluation of 1997’s Alien: Resurrection. It’s been kind of an Alien month here at the Culture Cast. We’ve covered the first and third movie as well as Prometheus. Let’s keep that up with a look at Resurrection.\n\nUntil last night, I had not seen Alien: Resurrection since the fall of 2003. I remember renting it from the university library around Halloween. At that point I had not seen it since it was released onto home video in 1998. I remember watching it that first time and just hating every moment. In 2003, I wanted to watch Alien: Resurrection again to see if my opinion of it had softened (it hadn’t). In 2012, I wanted to do the same yet again, because I am apparently a glutton for punishment. So I popped the movie in last night, feeling as if this was almost a mercy viewing. You see, I pretty much hate every moment of the fourth Alien movie, and find it to be an unnecessary, disgusting film that should have never been made.\n\nThe basic story: A few hundred years after the events of Alien 3, Ripley is cloned by scientists on board a gigantic military spacecraft. The alien queen in her body has been surgically removed. The military, sinister for no other reason than they are the military, has plans to use the queen for evil war stuff (there’s talk of using the aliens as an urban pacification method but it is never fully explored). Meanwhile, a group of mercenaries (one of the few Whedon-esque touches in the movie) deliver a mysterious cargo to military leader General Perez (Dan Hedaya, in perhaps his least convincing role). The mercs, played by such great character actors as Ron Perlman and Michael Wincott, are probably the best and most interesting part of the film, by the way. After a longer than necessary opening sequence or two, the aliens, captive in the military space craft, escape and wreak havoc on our cast.\n\nAfter Alien 3, I imagine the producers and creators behind the franchise found themselves in a bit of a quandary. Though 3 tanked domestically, worldwide receipts were good enough to put a fourth film into development. Reportedly, long-time producers David Giler and Walter Hill wanted little to do with Resurrection, though they did end up contributing the idea for a cloned Ripley (thus bringing back Sigourney Weaver). Joss Whedon, he of recent Avengers fame, was hired to write the script, though long-held anecdotal internet evidence suggests little of his script ended up in the final product (and I have reason to believe this, because as much as I don’t care for Whedon, this movie looks and feels like nothing he has ever done before). Thus, the creative forces behind Alien: Resurrection belong wholly to director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his usual crew (Marc Caro, Pitof, Darius Khondji). This is an obvious weakness throughout the movie. Nothing that happens in Alien: Resurrection feels anything at all like anything that happens in the three previous movies. Alien 3 took a lot of flak for being a bit different, but it at least felt like an Alien movie. Resurrection is just a gigantic mess.\n\nJeunet has his own, wholly French, visual aesthetic. His methods include extreme close-up shots, bizarre and lengthy camera tracking shots, and a yellow/brown haze that envelops his movies. This works for his previous films like Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children. It does not work for Alien: Resurrection. Jeunet is not the only problem with the film, however. The script is laboriously bad, and filled with inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies. This is nitpicky for sure, but Alien 3 took place on a planet called Fury 161. In Resurrection, a character refers to it, more than once, as Fury 16. Other inconsistencies include plot holes the size of bull mastiffs. At one point in the film, Call (the android, played by an unintentionally lifeless Winona Ryder) is shot and plummets to her “death” from what we can only assume was the sole escape path from the creatures for our heroes. A few minutes later, she reappears in a never-before-seen elevator, beckoning our heroes to hurry up and join her to safety. Why did the crew not just take the elevator in the first place? It would have saved them a ton of trouble and a couple of character deaths. In an earlier scene, two alien creatures attack and kill a third creature, using its acid blood to burn through the facility and escape. I thought this was actually pretty clever and consistent with the behavior of the creatures. However, later on in the movie one of the aliens spits its own acid blood at the face of one of the crew, badly burning him. Not only is this inconsistent with how the alien creatures have been portrayed in three previous movies, it also doesn’t make sense in the context of the script. Instead of killing the third creature, why did the other two simply not spit acid onto the floor to escape if they could? It makes no sense.\n\nOne of the things I hate the most about this movie is how needlessly disgusting it is. Alien: Resurrection opens with a man squishing a large bug and then spitting its guts onto the window through a straw, as if it were a spitball. Not exactly a great way to welcome viewers into a movie, but whatever. In what was supposed to be a chilling and dramatic scene, Ripley finds a room filled with failed clones of herself, including a monstrous abomination of a creature that begs for a quick death. This scene did nothing but amp up the gross factor. It was far too disgusting (and cheesy as well) to have the kind of dramatic impact the filmmakers were going for. In the ultimate show down between the alien/human hybrid and Ripley, there is a scene so disgusting it is almost hard to watch, as guts and skin and bones and all manners of grossness are sucked through a tiny hole in the ship’s hull and out into space. It is just so needlessly violent and disgusting, and is nothing like any of the Alien movies that came before. Whereas Alien 1, 2, and 3 all built their plots of fear, tension, paranoia, etc, Resurrection is content to just be plain gross.\n\nThere is so little to like about Alien: Resurrection. I can’t even get excited about Weaver’s performance as Ripley, which is incredibly disappointing considering I am a huge fan of the film series. Since she is a human/alien hybrid clone in this movie, most of her human emotions have been replaced with a kind of quiet, intense menace. Why take one of the most beloved sci-fi icons of filmdom and do this to her character? It just makes so little sense. Alien: Resurrection is a big, ugly mess of a film. Watching it in 2012 was no different than in 2003 and again no different than in 1998 when I first saw it. It is largely considered the worst of the Alien movies and for good reason. Avoid at all costs.\n\n-Z-\n\nMost film critics widely regard Ridley Scott’s Alien and James Cameron’s Aliens as untouchable masterpieces of their respective genres (sci-fi/horror and action). Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, however, are both generally considered flawed at best and downright awful at worst. While I can’t speak for Resurrection (at least not yet…), I wanted to give Alien 3 another shot. The circumstances I first saw the film in were probably not the best to ultimately judge it by. So I thought, with Ridley Scott’s would-be Alien prequel Prometheus opening this coming Friday, that now would be a great time to check out the second Alien sequel and see if time has been kinder to it throughout the years.\n\nHard as it may seem to believe, I remember the Alien 3 theatrical release and the considerable build up of hype that came with it. I should note I never saw this movie in theaters as it was rated-R, and I wasn’t allowed to see R movies until high school. I turned ten the year Alien 3 came out, but I was already a huge fan of the series. Aliens was my favorite movie at the time — I had seen it over and over again on cable TV, where it had been edited substantially for viewing audiences and formatted to fit my screen more appropriately. I wanted nothing more than to see Alien 3, but it was not to be. I remember an older cousin had gone to see it, and had less than kind things to say about it. I remember the disappointing box office grosses and the intensely negative fan reaction (yes I studied box office charts in the newspaper every week as a kid… I know how sad that sounds). And yet, I still wanted to see it. It was another Alien movie! How could it be bad? Building off the excellent sequel to one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, Alien 3 just had to deliver the goods, right?\n\nIt is important to remember that Alien 3 is twenty years old at this point. Several cinematic lifetimes have come and gone since the movie was released into theaters in May 1992. So when I finally saw it years later, edited for TNT or TBS (much the same way I had seen Aliens all those years earlier), it was no longer all that new, special, or interesting to me. I had moved on in that time span to Jurassic Park, Independence Day, Men in Black, and other sci-fi/action films released throughout that era. By the time I saw Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection was almost ready to be released in theaters. Thus, I saw this movie out of its era and out of its context. And while what I saw couldn’t really be called “great” by any stretch, I did not find Alien 3 to be as odious as many others had.\n\nI recently purchased the Alien Anthology Blu Ray set, which is one of the best reasons to own a Blu Ray player there could be (I waited for the price to drop from a super high $80 to a more manageable $40). The first (and only so far) film I’ve watched from the set was Alien 3. So why, if it’s at least my third favorite film in the bunch, would I watch it first? The Alien Anthology set contains a cut of the film known as “The Assembly Cut.” I had never seen this particular version of the film before, though I had long heard it was far better. Alien 3 had a particularly troubled development period, going through at least four different screen writers and three potential directors before filming. Ultimately, the film began shooting without a final script, and first-time director David Fincher (of Fight Club and Social Network fame) had to tinker and rewrite the script (uncredited obviously) just to finish things up. This is never a good sign for a movie production.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough for a young, inexperienced Hollywood director (Fincher was primarily known for innovative music videos), film studio Fox and several prominent executives and producers (namely, Walter Hill and David Giler) battled Fincher throughout production for control of the movie. After Fincher had finally completed his version of the film, Giler and Hill allegedly edited it substantially. The problem was that the Hill/Giler cut made less sense story-wise, excising the back story of and motivations for a key character. The Assembly Cut of Alien 3 is, apparently, much closer to Fincher’s vision (although Fincher declined to work on the Anthology set, apparently still bitter, perhaps rightfully so, about his experience on the film). Having seen it, the Assembly Cut makes a whole lot more sense than the theatrical version. It also helps that this twenty year old film has been digitally cleaned up in many places as well.\n\nThe main problems in Alien 3 still exist, however. It is completely stupid and illogical to kill off Hicks and Newt at the beginning of the film. I have read that the tone of Alien 3 was meant to be nihilistic, and their deaths (off-screen, mind you) play into a feeling of nihilism greatly. I can appreciate that attempt to establish tone, but after what the characters (and the viewers) went through during the events of Aliens, it is really difficult to see them killed off in such a fashion. The biggest argument for their deaths is that the Alien franchise is really Ripley’s story. Indeed, earlier drafts of the film had the plot of Alien 3 depicting primarily Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn) as the protagonist (and Sigourney Weaver apparently gave this her blessing). Fox had to fight for the inclusion of Ripley, and then had to pay Weaver a substantial salary (5 million dollars, in 1992 money) and give her a producer credit to get her involved again. The problem is that it doesn’t solve the audience’s desire to see more Hicks and Newt.\n\nAnother problem with the movie is that it is really fucking grim. It is the most grim and hopeless movie in the franchise, hands down. The prison planet itself is an entirely unattractive, dark, and cold locale where nothing works. It is also populated with men who have done absolutely unspeakable things in their pasts, leaving the audience feeling entirely unsympathetic with them when they inevitably die at the hands of the xenomorph. Charles S. Dutton, portraying the religious zealot Dillon, even describes himself as a murderer and rapist of women (though he does come to Ripley’s aid several times throughout the movie and serves as something of a moral compass for the other prisoners). The most sympathetic character in the film (outside of Ripley) is Dr. Clemons (the great Charles Dance), who is ostensibly the main character for the first third of the film. Dance’s performance is fantastic as the troubled Medical Officer with a dark secret in his past. He seems to be acting in a much better, more interesting movie as well. It’s just too bad he’s one of the first ones to get picked off.\n\nIn our recent Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (another flawed movie) podcast, I noted that my biggest issue with the film was its script. I feel the same way about Alien 3. This feels like several movies stitched together into one, and it indeed was. Original drafts had large portions of the film taking place on earth, with Hicks and Bishop (Lance Henriksen) as the main characters squaring off against aliens like the gung ho marines of the second film. Another draft took place on a planet populated by monks who built their structures and buildings primarily out of wood, which would have looked especially amazing in 1992 when it would have to be practical sets and not just a CGI effect (this was also apparently the best of the scripts). Filmmaker and screenwriter David Twohy (of Pitch Black fame) contributed a script that took place on a prison planet. Ultimately, producers Hill and Giler combined the scripts, leaving the movie feeling non-cohesive in spots.\n\nDespite my innumerable criticisms of Alien 3, I still like the film. I’ve long championed films that I find to be interesting failures, because at least they inspire conversation. Weaver’s performance as Ripley remains magnanimous, and is her best and most career-defining role. Fincher’s directorial style is also apparent here, even in his young age. It is easy to see the industrial-tinged sets of Alien 3 as a clear inspiration for later films like Seven and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Supporting cast members like the aforementioned Charles Dance as well as Ralph Brown (one of the very few sympathetic characters in the movie) are great. Set design and special effects are fantastic too. The alien is thankfully still primarily a puppet and puppeteer/human performer, although there are a few green/blue screen shots that I imagine looked awesome in 1992 (and still look ok to be honest). The bulk of the film looks absolutely amazing. The planet Fury 161 looks especially great on Blu Ray, with the shores and crashing water looking unforgiving and appropriately alien and uninviting. The final scenes, wherein the surviving prisoners attempt to trap the creature in a lead refinery withing the larger facility, are pretty exciting as well.\n\nI still can’t exactly call Alien 3 a good film. It has some pretty good, maybe even great, parts in it. But it’s not a good movie. It was a critical and commercial failure and earned heaps of scorn at the time it was released, but it definitely doesn’t deserve that reputation either. Additionally, I wouldn’t exactly call Alien 3 a middling, mediocre film either. It doesn’t fit neatly into any of our preconceived notions about what a film should be. It’s just an interesting failure; it’s part of the pantheon of sci-fi sequels that fell just short. The difference is that it is clear that the people behind the scenes of Alien 3 loved the source material. This was not a cash-in on the franchise like it could have been. Someone somewhere tried to make the movie as good as they could. Maybe they recognized that the film just wouldn’t be as good as the first two no matter what and did what they could to make Alien 3 a notable movie. I’d like to think that whoever did this did so because they thought it would at least make things more interesting. It was probably impossible to replicate the critical and commercial success of the first two films, but I’m at least glad someone tried.\n\n-Z-"
