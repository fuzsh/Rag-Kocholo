Dubbed \"Queen of Sci-Fi\",[2] Weaver is considered to be a pioneer of action heroines in science fiction films.[3] She is primarily known for her role as Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise. The role earned her an Academy Award nomination in 1986 and is often regarded as one of the most significant female protagonists in all of cinema.[4]\n\nA seven-time Golden Globe Award nominee, in 1988 she won both Best Actress in Drama and Best Supporting Actress for her work in the films Gorillas in the Mist and Working Girl, becoming the first person to win two acting Golden Globes in the same year. She also received Academy Award nominations for both films. For her role in the film The Ice Storm (1997), she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Weaver also received a Tony Award nomination for her work in the 1984 Broadway play Hurlyburly.\n\nWeaver's other popular film work includes Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Galaxy Quest (1999), Holes (2003), WALL-E (2008), Avatar (2009), Prayers for Bobby (2009), Paul (2011), The Cabin in the Woods (2012), A Monster Calls (2016), and The Defenders (2017).\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nWeaver was born in Manhattan, New York City, the only daughter of Elizabeth Inglis (née Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins; 1913–2007), an actress, and NBC television executive and television pioneer Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver (1908–2002).[5][6][7] Her uncle, Doodles Weaver (1911–1983), was a comedian and actor. Her mother was English, from Colchester, Essex, and her father, who was American, had English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, and Dutch ancestry, including roots in New England.[8][9] Weaver began using the name \"Sigourney Weaver\" in 1963 after a minor character (Mrs. Sigourney Howard, Jordan Baker's aunt) in Chapter 3[10] of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby.[11]\n\nWeaver attended the Ethel Walker School, a girls' preparatory school in Simsbury, Connecticut. She also attended The Chapin School and The Brearley School. Sigourney was reportedly Template:Cvt tall by the age of 14, although she only grew another inch during her teens to her adult height of Template:Cvt. In 1967, at the age of 18, Weaver visited Israel and volunteered on a kibbutz for several months.[12]\n\nWeaver attended Sarah Lawrence College. In 1972, she graduated with a B.A. in English from Stanford University,[13][14] where she first began her involvement in acting by living in Stanford's co-ed Beta Chi Community for the Performing Arts.[15] Weaver earned her Master of Fine Arts degree at the Yale University School of Drama in 1974,[16] where one of her appearances was in the chorus in a production of Stephen Sondheim's musical version of The Frogs, and another was as one of a mob of Roman soldiers alongside Meryl Streep in another production.[17] Weaver later acted in original plays by her friend and classmate Christopher Durang. She later appeared in an \"Off-Broadway\" production of Durang's comedy Beyond Therapy in 1981, which was directed by the up-and-coming director Jerry Zaks.[18]\n\nCareer[]\n\nWeaver's first role is often said to be in Woody Allen's comedy Annie Hall (1977) playing a non speaking role opposite Allen.[19] Weaver appeared two years later as Warrant Officer / Lieutenant Ripley in Ridley Scott's blockbuster film Alien (1979), in a role initially designated to co-star British-born actress, Veronica Cartwright, until a late change in casting. Cartwright stated to World Entertainment News Network (WENN) that she was in England ready to start work on Alien when she discovered that she would be playing the navigator Lambert in the project, and Weaver had been given the lead role of Ripley.[20]\n\nShe reprised the role in the three sequels of the Alien movie franchise, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe states, \"One of the real pleasures of Alien is to watch the emergence of both Ellen Ripley as a character and Sigourney Weaver as a star.\"[21]\n\nIn the sequel Aliens directed by James Cameron, critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"Weaver, who is onscreen almost all the time, comes through with a very strong, sympathetic performance: She's the thread that holds everything together.\"[22] She followed the success of Alien appearing opposite Mel Gibson in The Year of Living Dangerously released to critical acclaim and as Dana Barrett in Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II.\n\nBy the end of the decade, Weaver appeared in two of her most memorable and critically acclaimed performances.
