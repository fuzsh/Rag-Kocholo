        "text": "I think the idea actually came from Alan Ladd Jr. I think it was Alan Ladd [then-president of 20th Century Fox] who said, “Why can’t Ripley be a woman?” And there was a long pause, that at that moment I never thought about it. I thought, why not, it's a fresh direction, the ways I thought about that. And away we went.\n\nI don't understand why the father is so stupid that he marries these not just unpleasant women, but they are killers. So when Snow White the feature came along, what I thought I could do with it was present a women who married someone with the best intentions to be a good mother, to take the place of the dead mother. Who truly loved her husband.\n\nI think in our story, Snow White rejects the stepmother again and again and again. The father doesn't really take sides. And when she can't have her own children, and the aging thing, it all starts to come into play.\n\nIt was very interesting to go into one of these fairy tales and test its truth.\n\n…Sigourney was slightly older, had just done Alien, and she was so smart about the script. She said, “You know, I really think that Dana Barrett should be possessed. She should be like that dog on the roof.” And then she got on all fours on my coffee table, howling like a dog!\n\n…Right after she left my office, I called Harold Ramis and said: “Harold, Sigourney Weaver just started howling like a dog in my office. She said that she should get possessed by the dog and turn into a dog,” and I thought, “Damn, that’s a really good idea.”"
