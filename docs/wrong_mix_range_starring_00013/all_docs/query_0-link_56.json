        "text": "Even though Avatar 3 was reportedly shot alongside the Academy Award-winning Avatar: The Way of Water, James Cameron is never done tweaking his work.\n\nThe cast and crew of will film more scenes for the upcoming third installment, says one of the film’s most prominent figures. Sigourney Weaver recently revealed they’ll film more for Avatar 3 in January 2024.\n\nIn a recent interview with Screen Rant to promote Master Gardener, Weaver states she’ll return to Pandora early next year, ahead of Avatar 3‘s December 2024 release.\n\nWeaver tells the outlet: “I know that in January, I go back and probably do some pickups; I don’t think there are whole new scenes to be shot. I think it’s going to be refining what [James Cameron’s] got now that he’s closing in on the edit because he always has too much material. He loves to shoot. I wouldn’t even begin to guess of what we might be doing, but I think it’s just maybe going back to a couple of moments and giving him some footage that he didn’t get the way he wants to.”\n\nShe adds that what she is working on is mysterious: “No [I haven’t seen any footage], it’s not that kind of thing; it’s top secret even for us. [Chuckles] And then, probably when I go back in January and do a day on it, they will show me 20 minutes of it, but otherwise, I’m just in the dark, just like everybody else.”\n\nAhead of Avatar 3‘s release on December 24th, 2024, you can see the iconic actress Sigourney Weaver in Master Gardener, the latest film from Paul Schrader.\n\nMASTER GARDENER follows Narvel Roth (award-winner Joel Edgerton), the meticulous horticulturist of Gracewood Gardens. He is as much devoted to tending the grounds of this beautiful and historic estate, to pandering to his employer, the wealthy dowager Mrs. Haverhill (three-time Academy Award® nominee Sigourney Weaver). When Mrs. Haverhill demands that he take on her wayward and troubled great-niece Maya (Quintessa Swindell) as a new apprentice, chaos enters Narvel’s spartan existence, unlocking dark secrets from a buried violent past that threaten them all.\n\nSEE ALSO: Read our ★ ★ ★ review of Master Gardener here"
