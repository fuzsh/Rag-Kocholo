        "text": "AKA Susan Alexandra Weaver\n\nBorn: 8-Oct-1949\n\nBirthplace: Manhattan, NY [1]\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Alien\n\nBorn Susan Alexandra Weaver, she showed an early interest in literature, reading Moby Dick and other classics in grade school. She found the name 'Sigourney' in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, and adopted it as her \"stage name\" at adolescence. At 16, she joined a summer stock troupe in Southbury, Connecticut. She later majored in English at Stanford, and got a second degree in drama at Yale. Weaver appeared in several off-Broadway plays, and understudied for a supporting role in a Broadway production of W. Somerset Maugham's The Constant Wife. She had a small role on Somerset, a daytime soap opera, but to most people, Sigourney Weaver was a complete unknown when she starred in Alien. That was part of what made Alien so effective.\n\nSeveral other names in the cast were very familiar to audiences in 1979: Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto were bona fide movie stars, and John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, and Veronica Cartwright were recognizable character actors. Ticket-buyers logically assumed that Skerritt or Holm would turn out to be the movie's hero, but instead they were quickly eliminated. Alien offered many other clever twists, but this nifty casting trick -- killing the stars, one by one -- kept audiences unsure what to expect, and helped make the movie a hit.\n\nWeaver has since appeared in several Alien sequels, taken supporting roles in comedies Ghostbusters, Working Girl, Dave, and Galaxy Quest, and made smaller, more thoughtful films like Eyewitness, The Year of Living Dangerously, Gorillas in the Mist, and The Ice Storm. She has been nominated for an Oscar three times.\n\nSigourney Weaver's mother was a successful movie actress before marrying. Her father, Pat Weaver, was a high-level executive at NBC, and served as the peacock network's president for several years in the 1950s. He is generally credited as the creator of Today and The Tonight Show.\n\n[1] Leroy Hospital.\n\nFather: Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver (President of NBC, b. 21-Dec-1908, d. 15-Mar-2002)\n\nMother: Desiree Elizabeth Earl Inglis (actress)\n\nBrother: Trajan Weaver (older)\n\nBoyfriend: James McClure (author, together late 1970s)\n\nHusband: Jim Simpson (director, m. 1-Oct-1984, one daughter)\n\nDaughter: Charlotte Simpson (b. 1990)\n\nHigh School: Ethel Walker School, Simsbury, CT (1967)\n\nUniversity: BA English, Stanford University (1971)\n\nUniversity: BFA Drama, Yale University (1974)\n\nAfghanistan World Foundation Celebrity Committee\n\nHuman Rights First Board of Directors\n\nEndorsement of DirecTV (2007)\n\nRisk Factors: Smoking\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) (21-May-2017)\n\nThe Beatles: Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years (15-Sep-2016) · Herself\n\nA Monster Calls (9-Sep-2016)\n\nGhostbusters (9-Jul-2016)\n\nFinding Dory (8-Jun-2016) [VOICE]\n\nChappie (4-Mar-2015)\n\nExodus: Gods and Kings (3-Dec-2014)\n\nVamps (25-Aug-2012) · Cisserus\n\nThe Cold Light of Day (4-Apr-2012)\n\nRed Lights (20-Jan-2012)\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods (10-Dec-2011)\n\nAbduction (22-Sep-2011)\n\nRampart (10-Sep-2011) · Joan Confrey\n\nPaul (14-Feb-2011) · The Big Guy\n\nCedar Rapids (11-Feb-2011) · Macy Vanderhei\n\nYou Again (24-Sep-2010) · Ramona\n\nCrazy on the Outside (8-Jan-2010) · Viki\n\nAvatar (10-Dec-2009) · Grace\n\nPrayers for Bobby (21-Jan-2009)\n\nThe Tale of Despereaux (19-Dec-2008) · Narrator [VOICE]\n\nWall-E (27-Jun-2008) [VOICE]\n\nBaby Mama (23-Apr-2008)\n\nVantage Point (20-Feb-2008)\n\nBe Kind Rewind (20-Jan-2008)\n\nThe Girl in the Park (9-Sep-2007)\n\nHappily N'Ever After (5-Jan-2007) [VOICE]\n\nInfamous (31-Aug-2006)\n\nThe TV Set (28-Apr-2006)\n\nPlanet Earth (27-Feb-2006)\n\nSnow Cake (9-Feb-2006)\n\nImaginary Heroes (14-Sep-2004) · Sandy Travis\n\nThe Village (26-Jul-2004)\n\nHoles (11-Apr-2003) · The Warden\n\nThe Guys (11-Sep-2002)\n\nTadpole (11-Jan-2002) · Eve Grubman\n\nBig Bad Love (12-May-2001) · Voice of Betti DeLoreo [VOICE]\n\nHeartbreakers (23-Mar-2001)\n\nCompany Man (3-May-2000)\n\nGalaxy Quest (23-Dec-1999) · Gwen DeMarco\n\nA Map of the World (13-Sep-1999)\n\nAlien: Resurrection (6-Nov-1997) · Ripley\n\nSnow White: A Tale of Terror (18-Jul-1997) · Claudia Hoffman\n\nThe Ice Storm (12-May-1997)\n\nCopycat (27-Oct-1995)\n\nJeffrey (4-Aug-1995)\n\nDeath and the Maiden (23-Dec-1994)\n\nDave (7-May-1993)\n\n1492: Conquest of Paradise (9-Oct-1992) · Queen Isabel\n\nAlien 3 (22-May-1992) · Ripley\n\nGhostbusters II (16-Jun-1989) · Dana Barrett\n\nWorking Girl (21-Dec-1988) · Katharine Parker\n\nGorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey (23-Sep-1988)\n\nHalf Moon Street (13-Aug-1986)\n\nAliens (18-Jul-1986) · Ripley\n\nOne Woman or Two (6-Nov-1985)\n\nGhostbusters (8-Jun-1984) · Dana Barrett\n\nDeal of the Century (4-Nov-1983) · Mrs. DeVoto\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously (17-Dec-1982) · Jill Bryant\n\nEyewitness (26-Aug-1981) · Tony Sokolow\n\nAlien (25-May-1979) · Ripley\n\nMadman (1978)\n\nAnnie Hall (20-Apr-1977) · Alvy's Date Outside Theatre\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Sigourney Weaver\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
