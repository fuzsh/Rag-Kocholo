        "text": "[quote] Worked with her in the theater many years ago (but after she became a movie star) and she was absolutely delightful. Smart, funny and professional. She wasn't a very good stage actress though....kinda stiff in her line readings. But everyone loved her.\n\n[quote] You cannot find a person who has worked with her who will say a bad word about her. She becomes a den mother on every project she works on, helps to diffuse any tension that may arise. If she ever fell on hard times (and she won't because she is loaded and has handled finances brilliantly) the entire industry would rush to her side. Actors could learn a lesson by looking at her career and more importantly her demeanor.\n\n[quote] I know a handful of people who have met Sigourney over the years - holidays with mutual friends and the like - and they all said unreservedly that she is super cool and has a great sense of humour.\n\n[quote]I saw her on the street outside a theatre and just grabbed an autograph. I never do that but it was RIPLEY. She was nice and quickly signed it. She's very small though not short but her body is very skinny older woman. Not the rampaging muscles she had in Aliens.\n\nAnd more...\n\n[quote]I worked with both Streep and Weaver and have known them for a very long time. Weaver is fiercely ambitious and rather angry that there aren't more movies with roles for her. At 70 or months under she is not really competitive commercially in leading roles. She was always very limited. As is true of many camera actors (although she trained for and has worked on stage, more than Streep has over her career) what you see is what you get. She has a small range, a limited, thin voice, and is better at eccentrics (broadly defined) that at relatable people. In the Ice Storm, Alien franchise, Death and the Maiden even the two Durang plays she did on Broadway, she plays unusual, flamboyant types. She's game and committed, not always compelling at a high level. She is prepped, her manners are excellent, she behaves well socially. I am not sure she is so nice really, or so giving. You rarely become friends when you work with people, you are grateful when someone is a good, disciplined colleague. She is that.\n\n[quote]Streep really does have a massive talent, enormous technical facility and actor's intelligence of a high order. I haven't liked her in all that much over the last decade. I thought Doubt and the Iron lady were grotesque and didn't think she was special in The Devil wears Prada or Julie and Julia where I thought she settled for a SNL-like parody instead of a characterization (but consider the writer and director. Ephron was canonized, Jewish and her son is at the Times, but she was shit.) But when she snaps into a character she is memorable and compelling in ways I personally don't think Weaver is (usually). Streep is also a well behaved and cooperative colleague with an engaging sense of humor when she's comfortable.\n\n[quote]They both have so much money (entirely earned by her in Streep's case) no one needs to worry. And it goes without saying both have done infinitely better than most people who aspire to be actors. Streep will have more options as an old character woman and maybe more opportunities to play nuts and weirdos which I think she does best. Weaver isn't a character actor in that sense -- proper Wasp Grandmothers are what is likely to come to her if she chooses to do them. (She had a decade's worth of dreams of doing the great roles on stage but that came to nothing and it's too late now. I somehow remember her telling me that there was a production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf coalescing around her, and someone was interested in producing Hedda Gabler for her. But those did not materialize, and I don't think she had the vocal or imaginative force for either role.) It's a pity Streep didn't challenge herself more on stage but obviously, she could make much more in movies, and while the work can be really intense when you're the star, it's not the same as eight performances a week with a four or five-month commitment. She was supposed to star in Wendy Wasserstein's awful An American Daughter, and had participated in a number of readings and I believe a short workshop in Seattle. But she reportedly called Andre Bishop, the head of Lincoln Center who was producing the play sobbing that she had to use the time to be with her children who would be leaving home soon. Kate Nelligan did a good job but it was hopeless and I have tended to suspect that Streep realized it was a bomb and didn't want to be associated with it. You don't make her kind of career without that sort of smarts."
