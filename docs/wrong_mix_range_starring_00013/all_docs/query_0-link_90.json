        "text": "As the pumpkins begin to decompose, the sound of fireworks fill the air and thought, inevitably, turns to Christmas – wait! Back the sled up, its a little too early for that kind of talk (even for me!). No, we have at least one more edition of My Life In Film… to take care of before the lights go up at Greenscreen Towers. This time around, and I know I say this quite a lot, there are some absolute gems of movies to savour including two massive Oscar winners, a ground-breaking Disney classic and a couple of legendary comedies. Grab yourself a blanket and warm yourself up by the glowing fire of Part 34…\n\nLOCAL HERO (1983)\n\nI hate to admit that I was very late to the Local Hero party. I’d heard so many great things about it but never got around to watching it. Thankfully, I’ve rectified that and can honestly say it is one of the best British films. It is a beautiful story about a man shedding his hi-tech skin in favour of the cool, serene surroundings of Scotland. Writer/Director Bill Forsyth has created a truly memorable modern fable about finding peace in nature. With a stunning cast including Peter Riegert, Denis Lawson, Peter Capaldi and Burt Lancaster, Local Hero is a must for any true movie fan. It will warm your heart and calm your soul.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSMALL SOLDIERS (1998)\n\nA toy company uses the latest military technology to ‘improve’ their product which enables these two sets of action figures (the Gorgonites and Commando Elite) to talk and think for themselves. With the help of two kids – Gregory Smith and Kirsten Dunst – the Gorgonites must protect their home from the enemy. Director Joe Dante brings his unique style to this wonderful family adventure which features some of the remaining cast of The Dirty Dozen adding their voices to the toys. Its packed full of action, comedy and dazzling special effects and is a must watch!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “I’m pretty messed up”\n\nMY FAIR LADY (1964)\n\nAlready a smash-hit Broadway play, My Fair Lady was a cinema sensation. Keeping original theatre lead Rex Harrison as Professor Henry Higgins who makes a wager that he can take a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Dolittle (the mesmerising Audrey Hepburn) and transform her into a cultured member of high society. Its a truly magnificent spectacle with some outstanding song and dance numbers matched with the sheer scale and look of the film that saw it scoop eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Harrison. It is one of the most beloved Hollywood musicals and rightly so, for everything about it just shines and its a film that you’ll never forget.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Classic trailer\n\nFLETCH (1985)\n\nIn this comedy, Chevy Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, a newspaper reporter who is offered a large stash of money to help bump off a supposedly dying millionaire. Fletch’s nose for a story gets him into trouble, though as he’s also working undercover to help expose a drug ring that may or may not have ties to this case. Chase is perfectly cast as the reporter with the gift of the gab who has the ability to talk his way in and out of trouble while using a series of elaborate disguises. Chase reprised his role a few years later in a less impressive sequel.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Autopsy Assistant!\n\nA PERFECT WORLD (1993)\n\nClint Eastwood directs and co-stars as a gruff Texas Ranger in pursuit of two recently escaped convicts, Butch (Kevin Costner) and Terry (Keith Szarabajka). During their escape, the pair kidnap a young boy, Philip (TJ Lowther) and flee across country. Eastwood’s Ranger is joined by criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) in the race to bring back their bounty. Its a beautifully shot, engaging movie with a solid performance from young Lowther who manages to hold his own along with a very impressive Costner. This is a film that sometimes gets overlooked by some of Eastwood’s other, more popular, movies but it really is worth seeking out.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trick or Treat\n\nMARS ATTACKS! (1996)\n\nThis is one of those films that, on first viewing, I really didn’t enjoy at all. At the time I thought it was a mess and I was confused by what it was supposed to be. Its only on repeat viewings that I’ve come to appreciate the majesty of Tim Burton‘s manic alien invasion movie. Its a huge movie, not just in scale but in the sheer size of cast. You watch this film and forget just how many people are actually in it. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Tom Jones, Martin Short, Pierce Brosnan and Rod Steiger to name just a few. Its bizarre, colourful and, at times, really weird but that’s the kind of thing you expect from a Tim Burton movie, right? Sure, its still a bit messy and confusing but, with older eyes, its a better watch than the first time around.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “They blew up Congress!”\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991)\n\nPrior to The Academy Awards introducing a Best Animated Feature category, this magical Disney film was the first fully animated movie to be nominated for Best Picture (losing out to Silence of the Lambs) and the first to win a Golden Globe for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. Its not hard to see why everyone took this film to their hearts. Harking back to the classic Disney movies of the past, Beauty and the Beast tells the story of a selfish prince, cursed to spend the rest of his life as a monster unless he can fall in love with a beautiful girl he has as a prisoner. Full of wonderful animation, majestic songs and forging a path for some of the greatest Disney movies every made, this is a joyous adventure and one of my mum’s favourites!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Ballroom\n\nTHE ABYSS (1989)\n\nI’m usually hyper-critical of James Cameron films, the majority of which are absolute nonsense, but this sci-fi epic is one of the exceptions. When Cameron gets it right, his vision is truly stunning. A civilian diving team, lead by Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Cameron regular Michael Biehn, is enlisted to help the search for a missing nuclear submarine but find themselves fending off danger from an unlikely, alien species. Featuring ground-breaking special effects and, quite often, fear-inducing underwater scenes, The Abyss is a slow-burner of a film. More cerebral than most, yet still managing to bring enough scares and adventure to keep you watching.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “I think it likes you”\n\nCOPYCAT (1995)\n\nThis tense, psychological thriller from director Jon Amiel pits agoraphobic psychiatrist Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) and tough detective M. J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) against a dangerous serial killer who is copying the most notorious killers from the past. Weaver and Hunter are, as you’d expect, magnificent as are the rest of the supporting cast but, for me, the real stand-out performance here is Harry Connick Jr. as the antagonist of the piece. His creepy and downright sadistic portrayal of serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum stays with you and proves to be a worthy opponent for the two leads.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nDOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965)\n\nMovies don’t come much more epic than this one from David Lean. A stunningly beautiful romance starring Omar Sharif and Julie Christie and set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Lean’s films are always full of sweeping, majestic imagery and you are treated to some of the most iconic scenes here, courtesy of legendary cinematographer, Freddie Young. Add to that the most luscious score from Maurice Jarre and you have a truly wonderful piece of cinema. At over three hours, it is a long haul but you are carried away by the sheer brilliance of all involved.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Somewhere My Love\n\nAnd there you have it, the thirty-fourth instalment of this epic odyssey of cinema. I hope you liked it. I think you’ll agree that, once again, it was quite eclectic and just goes to show my tastes in film is as varied as the Hollywood output itself. Please feel free to get in touch if the mood takes you and let me know what you think. The next time we meet we’ll be decking the halls with festive favourites! Until then…\n\n“I could grow to love this place”\n\nCan you believe it? Part twenty! At the end of this there will be 200 films in this countdown of my favourites. I was just looking through the list I’ve accumulated so far and was shocked to find a couple of absolute classics that I’ve missed! Don’t worry, that error has been rectified, so settle in for some more eclectic cinematic treats!\n\nKUFFS (1992)\n\nThis is one of those curious films that nobody else seems to remember, and there’s probably a very good reason for that! It isn’t the greatest film ever made, nor is it the worst (I’ve seen plenty of those in my time!) but it is an interesting one. Teen heartthrob Christian Slater plays George Kuffs, a guy who isn’t really going anywhere in life, who loses his job and finds out his girlfriend (Milla Jovovich) is pregnant. He visits his older brother, Brad (Bruce Boxleitner) to ask for a loan but Brad is suddenly killed and Kuffs finds himself taking over Brad’s police patrol special district (Yeah, I know!. Ultimately, this film (which was written specifically for Slater) fails because it doesn’t really know what it’s trying to be. It’s funny, slightly irritating (Kuffs talks to camera a lot!) but it does have some great music on the soundtrack.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer!\n\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)\n\nHere’s a classic example of the power of home video sales turning a relatively disappointing run at the box office into a massive, global success. The Shawshank Redemption, while only doing modest business in cinemas became a phenomenon that saw it nominated for 7 Academy Awards (sadly, going home empty handed) and continually atop Greatest Film polls. Based on a short story by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, it’s the tale of two men, imprisoned together for many years who find solace and hope in one another. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are on spectacular form as are the rest of the stunning cast. This film will uplift you, even though the subject matter might not. It really is a sensationally brilliant film.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opera\n\nWORKING GIRL (1988)\n\nMelanie Griffith is frustrated secretary Tess McGill, struggling to find her way in the world of big business in New York. When her boss, played by Sigourney Weaver, breaks her leg on a skiing holiday, Tess gets her chance to shine. She teams up with investment broker Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) to reach a deal. But then her boss returns! This wonderful comedy from director Mike Nichols showcases Griffith’s hitherto unseen acting chops and gives us a chance to see Ford and Weaver in rare comedic roles. To top it off, there’s the best Oscar-winning song ever from Carly Simon!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “A head for business…”\n\nBATMAN RETURNS (1992)\n\nIt was, perhaps, almost inevitable that Tim Burton would return to the dark streets of Gotham City following the huge success of Batman (1989). Michael Keaton returns as the Dark Knight and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, as does Michael Gough as his trusty butler, Alfred. This time around, though, there is more evil in the city in the shape of The Penguin (Danny DeVito), Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the delectable Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. It is an admirable sequel that sometimes falls apart trying to manage multiple villains (although not as bad as the later sequels) but on the whole it is just as enjoyable as the original.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Meow!\n\nSTEPPING OUT (1991)\n\nDid somebody say “Curveball”? Well, I probably wouldn’t have given this film a chance had it not been for my sister and her love of all things Musicals. It’s a surprisingly delightful film that only gets better on repeat viewings. Liza Minnelli plays Mavis Turner, a former Broadway star who now provides tap dancing lessons to a group of misfit performers, including Julie Walters and Bill Irwin. As they dance together, they begin to realise that they’re not that bad and find themselves taking part in a charity dance recital. Stepping Out delivers everything you’d expect from a great underdog story and lifts the spirits.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nYOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974)\n\nThe brilliant, and much missed, Gene Wilder plays the grandson of the infamous scientist, Dr Frankenstein. He is a neurosurgeon trying to put his family’s legacy behind him when he finds out that he has inherited his grandfather’s castle. Upon arrival he discovers his grandfather’s notes on reanimation and soon the family legacy is brought back to life. Wilder wrote the script and offered it to director Mel Brooks while the two were working on Blazing Saddles with the stipulation that Brooks not appear as it would distract the audience. It is, quite rightly, a classic comedy thanks, in part, to the fabulous cast. Marty Feldman as Igor (with his moveable hump!), Teri Garr as Inga and Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher, but it is Peter Boyle as The Monster who steals the show.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Puttin On The Ritz\n\nPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)\n\nWhat started out as a ride at Disneyland has turned into a leviathan of a movie franchise with a fifth entry due in cinemas any day now. This first film, though, is the best of the lot by far. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, a blacksmith who crosses swords with the eccentric pirate “Captain” Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and join forces to search for Will’s true love, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) who has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush). This is swash-buckling at it’s best from director Gore Verbinksi and legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The quality of the sequels diminished but this original, and best, shows what Hollywood can do when it cares about a subject.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The first appearance of Jack\n\nFORREST GUMP (1994)\n\nAsk most people and they would probably tell you that Forrest Gump shouldn’t have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1995. Popular opinion would suggest either Pulp Fiction or the aforementioned The Shawshank Redemption should have taken the prize. That’s how it goes sometimes, The Academy “makes mistakes”. I’m happy it won, to be honest, because it’s a beautiful film, if somewhat over sentimental. Tom Hanks plays the eponymous hero, a simple man with a low IQ who just happens to have participated in some iconic moments in history. Sentimentality aside, Forrest Gump is a beautifully imagined fable reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Director Robert Zemeckis uses every trick and technique in the book to bring Forrest’s stories to life while the supporting cast of Sally Field, Gary Sinise and Myketi Williamson add substance to his tales.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Forrest and Bubba talk shrimp!\n\nTHE EXPENDABLES (2010)\n\nThe Expendables is all-action, gung-ho, boys-own nonsense and I love it! Sylvester Stallone directs and leads an all-star cast of action superstars that cross the generations. The plot, inconsequential as it is, sees a CIA operative hire a group of mercenaries to eliminate a dictator and rogue CIA agent. The main draw, though, is the first time that Stallone share the screen with his 80s action contemporaries Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke are among the other iconic stars taking part in the action. The two sequels (so far!) take the numbers higher and the quality lower, but that’s beside the point. The point is action and fun, and this film has both!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Old friends!\n\nSCHINDLER’S LIST (1993)\n\nSchindler’s List proved that director Steven Spielberg can do more than just fantasy and action adventure films. It’s a more personal film than anything he had made previously, focussing on the horrors of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, a usually greedy businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian when he discovers his Jewish workforce is being persecuted by the Nazis. Everything about this film is immense, from the black and white cinematography, the outstanding performances (Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley shine) to the heart-breaking John Williams score. The film garnered 7 Academy Awards, including the first for Spielberg, but it’s the film’s legacy – The Shoah Foundation – that is the true winner here.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The List Is Life… You need to watch it anyway as it stands as a learning tool for future generations…\n\nAnd there you have it – 200 films! There are more but, for now, this is where the list ends. I will be returning to it at a later date once I’ve gathered a little more research and searched the memory banks! I’m also looking into doing a shorter list of films that I really don’t like that much. It seems only fair to share the yang to my ying (or vice versa!). Until we meet again I’m off to reanimate a few corpses, maybe!\n\n“You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates”\n\nAs sure as tock follows tick, night follows day, Part Seventeen must surely follow Part Sixteen. Another batch of ten films in my ever multiplying list of favourites from over the years. As a great man once said: “It’s not the years honey, it’s the mileage” – some of these films really have the mileage…see if you can spot the curve ball in this rundown!\n\nANCHORS AWEIGH (1945)\n\nTwo sailors on a four day shore leave in Hollywood meet an aspiring young singer (played by Kathryn Grayson) and try to get her signed to MGM. It’s pretty much standard movie musical fare when it comes to plot but that’s not the reason to watch it. Gene Kelly is, as always, magnificent alongside fellow sailor Frank Sinatra. A young Dean Stockwell plays Grayson’s nephew who wants to join the navy and grows attached to the two sailors. There are some great song and dance numbers, none more so than the brilliant Jerry Mouse routine.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Gene Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse – “Look at me, I’m dancing!”\n\nGALAXY QUEST (1999)\n\nSci-fi conventions are THE place to go to catch a glimpse of your favourite stars from television and film. When a group of TV stars of the past reunite at a convention they get a little more than they bargained for. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and the ever brilliant (and much missed) Alan Rickman play the stars of TV’s ‘Galaxy Quest’ and are approached at a convention by real aliens believing their characters to be the real deal. Their help is needed to solve a problem of intergalactic proportion!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The show must go on!\n\nBIRDMAN or (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE) (2014)\n\nMichael Keaton knows a thing or two about playing a famous superhero, having played Batman twice, so it’s interesting to see him here playing an actor trying to shake off the spectre of an all-encompassing role and be taken seriously. Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, an actor who made his name playing Birdman in three movies, who is trying to stage an epic comeback by writing, directing, starring-in and co-producing a play on Broadway. What we see is a man in meltdown and the consequences this has on the people around him. His daughter, played by Emma Stone, his friend and co-producer Zach Galifinakis and temperamental star Edward Norton. It is a daring, imaginative piece of filmmaking from Alejandro G. Innaritu which rightly won four Academy Awards, including a nomination for Keaton.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Does she talk?”\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN: THE SECRET OF THE UNICORN (2011)\n\nBased on the classic comic books by Herge, this is the first animated feature film from director Steven Spielberg about the intrepid young reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his faithful dog, Snowy. In this story he goes on a treasure hunt for sunken treasure with help from drunken sea-dog Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis). Using motion-capture and animation techniques, its a fun thrill-ride of an adventure and, according to IMDb a sequel is on the way!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Falcon chase\n\nREMO: UNARMED AND DANGEROUS (1985)\n\nOr Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, to give it it’s original title. A James Bond-style franchise was planned with this film based on “The Destroyer” novels but this film didn’t play well and all we’re left with is this bizarre gem of an action flick. Fred Ward stars as Remo Williams a cop who is supposedly killed in the line of duty and subsequently trained as a lethal assassin to work for the US President. With a strange mix of action, martial arts and just a hint of the supernatural, Remo is an underrated cult classic with an iconic scene atop the Statue of Liberty. Stellar support from Wilford Brimley and the ever wonderful Joel Grey as Remo’s mentor.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Statue of Liberty and walking on cement!\n\nROXANNE (1987)\n\nThis is one of my favourite Steve Martin performances. Based on the play “Cyrano De Bergerac” he plays C.D. Bales who, while having an unusually large nose, falls for the beautiful Roxanne (Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, though she’s attracted to his personality she falls for the looks of another man (Rick Rossovich) who seeks Bales’ advice on wooing Roxanne. It’s a delightful comedy that showcases Martin’s charm and wit.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Insults to a nose\n\nFARGO (1996)\n\nJerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) works in his father-in-laws car dealership and has got himself into some serious financial strife. He sets a plan in motion for two men (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom but he didn’t bet on the men being inept at their job and the amount of bloodshed it entails. He is further hampered by the local Sheriff, played to perfection in an Oscar-winning role by Frances McDormand who is determined to find the killers whilst nine months pregnant. This is a brilliant and twisted thriller from The Coen Brothers which has since gone on to spawn a very successful television series.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Frances McDormand’s wonderful performance\n\nDOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1975)\n\nThis is one of those films that is just so bad it’s actually pretty awful but still ok to watch every now and then. Based on the pulp novels about an intelligent superhero in the 1930s and starring Ron Ely as the titular title character. Doc Savage returns home to find his father has died and that he has become the target of an assassination plot. He assembles his team “The Fabulous Five” (Paul Gleason, William Lucking, Michael Miller, Eldon Quick and Darrell Zwerling) and vows to solve his father’s murder. It’s cheesy, camp and over the top but with enough action and humour to keep you watching. This film used to be shown quite a lot during the school holidays but has since been banished to the “best left forgotten” pile.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The cheesiest of cheesy trailers!\n\nQUICK CHANGE (1990)\n\nGrimm (Bill Murray) enters a New York bank dressed as a clown in order to commit a robbery. With the help of his two friends (Geena Davis and Randy Quaid) the pull off the heist but their biggest problem is escaping the city and getting to the airport. Murray acted as co-director on this film with his co-writer Howard Franklin. The idea of Murray, with his deadpan demeanour, dressed as a clown is superb and the supporting cast are excellent. It’s surprising then, that the film isn’t as fondly remembered as it should be. It’s certainly one of Murray’s best performances, if not his famous.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE (1963)\n\nThis is one of those films that Hollywood used to do so well. A massive, ensemble piece with glorious scenery, plenty of action and a leading man so damn cool it should be illegal. Steve McQueen leads the all-star cast as Allied soldiers plan a daring escape from their Nazi camp during World War II. Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, James Garner, James Coburn, David McCallum, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are just some of the stellar line-up in John Sturges‘ epic (almost 3 hours!) perennial favourite that features some of the most iconic scenes in movie history not to mention one of the most famous pieces of film music ever written!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: McQueen’s motorcycle escape\n\nIf you were to look up the word “eclectic” in the dictionary I’m pretty sure you’d find this edition of My Life In Film… From singing sailors to deadpan bank robbers, ace reporters to The King of Cool this has a little bit of everything. That’s pretty much how my taste in film goes as well, a veritable concoction of movie genres and a cornucopia of actors and actresses. If you liked what you saw here today, please feel free to get in touch – you can message me direct on here or find me on Twitter as @Shadow_Chaser – I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m off to throw a baseball against the wall for a few hours!\n\nAnd so, like the depressing inevitability of yet another Seth Rogen project, I return with another sampling of films that have made an impact on me in one way or another. I’m hurtling through these at the moment, the momentum is strong (and stable!) and the list is getting longer! I was flicking through the TV channels seeing what was coming up over the next week and added another four films to the ever-growing list, so before I run out of space…let’s go to work!\n\nHOPE AND GLORY (1987)\n\nThis is a beautiful film. A semi-autobiographical story from writer/director John Boorman about Bill, a young boy growing up in London during the Blitz. It shows the adventure that most children at the time saw the Blitz as, the danger and destruction was their playground. Sebastian Rice-Edwards is just superb as Bill and Ian Bannen as his grandfather also stands out among a stellar cast. You really must watch it.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007)\n\nThe Coen Brothers really know how to make a great movie. This is one of their best. Josh Brolin plays Moss, a hunter who stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and takes the 2 million dollar loot for himself. This sends psychotic killer, Chigurh (Javier Bardem on Oscar-winning form) on his trail. In amongst all the ensuing bloodshed, Tommy Lee Jones‘ Sheriff Bell oversees an investigation, the like of which he finds difficult to comprehend. It’s a twisted, dark thriller but you’d expect nothing less from the minds that brought us Barton Fink and Miller’s Crossing.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Call it”\n\nLETHAL WEAPON 3 (1992)\n\nI seem to recall, when this film was released, a lot of the advertising implied that this would be the last ever entry in the franchise. Also implied, I think, was that Riggs would die in the movie. I may have made all of that up but I’m pretty sure that’s how it was perceived to be. We know, of course, that one more film was made but I won’t go into that one just yet. Anyway, Riggs (Mel Gibson) & Murtagh (Danny Glover) return to crack crime on the streets of Los Angeles and come up against an arms dealer who is a former LAPD officer. The laughs are played high on this one, the cast clearly comfortable with each other and the welcome return of Joe Pesci only adds to the comedy. Rene Russo is brought on board as a love interest for Riggs who turns out to be quite a match for him. It’s the most fun of the four films and for that reason alone it warrants it’s place in this list.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Will Riggs survive the fall?\n\nSTAR WARS: EPISODE V – THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980)\n\nThree years after the original movie smashed box-office records, The Empire Strikes Back proves that sometimes, sequels can be better. Often quoted as being the better entry in the Star Wars family, it’s certainly a lot darker. Whilst under attack from Imperial forces on the ice planet Hoth, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) escape in the Millennium Falcon; Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) journeys to Dagobah in search of Master Jedi Yoda in order to get help in defeating Darth Vader in the ultimate duel.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Things get ‘frosty’ for Han\n\nTHE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE (1985)\n\nTom Hanks plays a man who is picked out at random and made the target of CIA surveillance. I know it’s not one of the best films ever made but I’ve always had a soft spot for Hanks’ earlier roles. They might have been stupid and without focus but they were enjoyable. This one had the added bonus of James Belushi and Carrie Fisher as well as 80s icon Dabney Coleman. But, to be fair, that’s pretty much all it had going for it!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: If you don’t want to watch the film, the trailer will fill in the blanks!\n\nCASABLANCA (1942)\n\nCasablanca is, quite rightly, regarded by many as one of the greatest Hollywood movies of all time. It often features very high in Greatest Film Ever lists and has become a pop culture icon for generations. Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick, a world-weary, cynical, ex-pat who now runs a bar in Morocco at the start of World War II. He faces adversity and pressure from local authorities, despite his bar being a haven for refugees seeking a way out of the country. Then his ex-lover, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and her husband arrive forcing him to make some difficult decisions. Often misquoted and parodied but never bettered, Casablanca is a true masterpiece of cinema.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Here’s looking at you, kid”\n\nTOP SECRET! (1984)\n\nWhen you see the names Zucker and Abrahams on the credit list you certainly know what you’re letting yourself in for. A playful spoof of WWII movies, Top Secret! is, perhaps, not as universally liked as Airplane! but it definitely has the same exclamation mark! Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, a rock ‘n’ roll singer performing in East Germany and gets caught up in the French Resistance’s fight for freedom. There are some brilliant sight gags (the giant telephone) and it has one of my all time favourite jokes – “I know a little German. He’s sitting over there” – but the best bit for me is Peter Cushing‘s cameo (see below). Top Secret! is funny, crude and completely insane. That’s probably why I like it!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Peter Cushing’s brilliant cameo – Backwards Bookstore!\n\nFLATLINERS (1990)\n\nThere’s a scene in Flatliners that gave me nightmares for weeks. Despite that, I’ve enjoyed watching it again since, although I still got a little knot in my stomach when that scene approached! Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt are the medical students who decide to do an experiment on near-death experiences only to discover that they have awakened something deep inside their consciousness. Director Joel Schumacher guides the film well and treats us to a few scares and shocks but it’s the cast of future megastars that take full credit here.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nRUNNING SCARED (1986)\n\nBilly Crystal and Gregory Hines play two Chicago cops who, after almost getting themselves killed on a case, take a vacation to Key West. Whilst there they decide to quit their jobs and retire out there. Upon their return to Chicago they find that the drug dealer who nearly killed them has made bail and is out to make a big deal. Crystal and Hines are a great team and bounce off each other brilliantly but you do feel that the film lacks a certain something. Jimmy Smits provides the villainous support but the film belongs to the cops.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The cops getting mugged!\n\nALIENS (1986)\n\nSequels are usually tricky waters to sail but in the right hands they can sometimes be loved and enjoyed more than the original. Such is the case with Aliens, the blockbuster sequel to the 1979 Ridley Scott original Alien. Director James Cameron (before he became “King of the world” and hot on the heels of The Terminator) brings Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) out of hyper-sleep for another battle with the extra terrestrial beings. Ripley joins a team of rugged space marines lead by Michael Biehn and featuring a powerhouse performance from the late, great Bill Paxton. The action is relentless without losing sight of the story or the integrity of the characters which makes it stand out as an exemplary sequel.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Surrounded by aliens!\n\nAnd there you have it…150 films so far in this countdown of my favourites. Some great, some good and some…well, some are better left alone! Still plenty more to come so stay tuned and don’t forget you can get in touch and let me know what you think. Until next time…Here’s looking at you, kid!"
