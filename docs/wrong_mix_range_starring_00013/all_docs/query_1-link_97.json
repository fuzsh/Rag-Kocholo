        "text": "Action and science fiction movies are often a male actor’s domain. The blood, guts, and glory of a fight between good and evil were too often stereotyped as a man’s job to complete — that is, until Sigourney Weaver came along. Weaver completely broke down the gender walls put up between women and action movies, showing audiences around the globe that the ladies don’t actually need any help to defeat the bad guys. For over four decades, Weaver has continued to stick with mostly genre-heavy work, but when she’s stepped out into the realms of comedy, drama, and even biopics, the results have been just as tremendous. We’re here to celebrate the best Sigourney Weaver movies."
