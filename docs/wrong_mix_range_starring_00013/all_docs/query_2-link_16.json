        "text": "This woman is a goddess of film, and every bit as versatile as her school chum Meryl. She's a national treasure in her own little way, and everyone seems to like her, but why doesn't she have an Oscar? Why doesn't she get the Meryl/Glenn treatment?\n\nI appreciate all the dignity she's brought to science fiction roles, such as the \"Alien\" films, and works like \"Galaxy Quest\" and \"Avatar.\" But she's also amazing in comedy - physical schtick as well as dialogue-heavy parts. She's tall. She's hilarious. She's a true talent.\n\nI wonder about her natural accent, though. She's American, but had an English mother and went to upper-crust Eastern boarding schools. Maybe that's why she has such a faint lilt to her voice.\n\nHer father was Pat Weaver, who basically invented network television as we know it today. He created The Today Show, The Tonight Show, and the star-centered network special. He also revamped the business model of television, moving shows away from direct corporate sponsorship (\"Unocal Presents A Dinah Shore Christmas\") and into commercial-length sponsorships. This model returned creative control of television to producers and affiliates, and took it away from the soap executives who essentially owned entire blocks of broadcast time.\n\nThere was some early awards buzz about her performance in The Good House where she plays a Realtor who's a secret drunk. Co-starring her old pal Kline. But it apparently came out in September and promptly disappeared without a trace. Seems like she could still get a Best Actress with the right role, she should be lobbying A-list directors for a comeback role.\n\nShe should have won best supporting for Working Girl over Geena Davis in the largely forgotten The Accidental Tourist. She was also soooooo good in The Ice Storm.\n\nIn 1988 I'd give it to Close as that was her best film performance ever.\n\nWeaver was good in GORILLAS, but it was more of a \"personality\" performance than the kind of character lead performance that, say, Streep would do. Also, the film isn't that good anyway. It doesn't hold up well.\n\nWeaver can be genuinely sexy in a way that Streep and Close never could.\n\nI saw that film MY SALINGER YEAR (the U.S. title) mentioned in the article at R1 - Weaver is terrific but the film is mediocre and Margaret Qualley is just awful in it.\n\nShe's generally better on screen than on stage, though I saw her Off-Broadway twice (in VANYA, SONYA, etc. when it initially played in the smaller house at Lincoln Center and MRS. FARNSWORTH) and she was fine both times, so she's better in smaller theaters.\n\nThe only time I saw her on Broadway was in the horrendous SEX & LONGING, a play so bad that no one in the cast could save it. So I don't blame her for not doing well that time.\n\nWhat I do like about her: She keeps her business to herself. I don’t know anything about her personal life. Does she have a husband and children? I don’t know! There is no gossip about her, she doesn’t feud with other celebrities, she doesn’t swan about trying to get publicity with bullshit charities.\n\nActually, this outweighs what I said earlier (that she seems snobbish and mean).\n\nI’d like to change my answer. I DO love her!\n\nI agree with you, op, i love her (though she seems to be that rare thing, a dl consensual ). It is ridiculous she doesn’t have an oscar. In my view she has also been in better/more iconic movies than streep or close: All the aliens, working girl, the ice storm, death and the maiden, to name a few. She is also fabulous in singing Back In The USSR. She can do comedy. I alo apreeciate she keeps to herself, like others said. In my mind she belongs with Michelle Pfeiffer, Glenn Close and Anette Benning on the great American actresses that don’t have an oscar. Having said all this, Glenn should have won that year, and Sigorney should have won for Working Girls. It was a double disappointment.\n\nWatched Working Girl for the first time, since perhaps the 80's a couple of years ago. The film is a bit dated, but her performance is great and she really has some nice nuances and subtext to her performance.\n\nGalaxy Quest is actually a pretty good satire and still is funny on repeat viewings.\n\nI watched the Ghostbusters reboot. She looks good in her cameo. I am guessing she has had some work done, but looks very natural and aging gracefully. She also had a nice, understated timing in her scene.\n\nHer early work with Ingrid Bergman.\n\nAlways liked and was impressed with her abilities and talent as an actor. Also loved her in the first 2 \"Alien\" films and feel that it's underrated how she really was the first female lead in films' sci-fi genre history who didn't end up being or playing the fearful, screaming and vacuous \"pretty damsel-in-distress\" who trips running away from the monsters and the man in her film life has to stand up for and rescue her. Her \"Ripley\" character took things into her own hands and didn't take any crap from those \"Alien\" bitches! :)\n\nShe's sexy to me and seems to live a really low key life when she is not working or doing p.r.\n\nIt's interesting to me that she is distant cousins to Jane Fonda for they are both foxes eternally.\n\nHer overall manner is cool. She was raised with great wealth and is finely educated but somehow wears all of that really well. She could have had her own father (RIP) hook her up with most any television gig going way early on in her career but she didn't do that. It's like she knew not to go too far on the nepotism front. She obviously did the nepotism thing a bit but she truly didn't go for broke with it early on in her career. All of these things makes her less annoying than some. She's cool. Been married since the year one with the one kid and harms nobody. I dig her.\n\nNow, Paula Prentiss is kinda like the fairy Godmother for taller actresses. But, Sigourney Weaver was easily a full six feet tall back in the day. I don't know if that held her back at University along with the Meryl thing or what. But, she wears her height well what with her nice posture and bearing. She's also basically has always been in great shape and I would dare say she leads a clean cut lifestyle.\n\nLike I say. She's cool to me.\n\n[quote]It says they worked together, [R71]. On what?\n\nWorked together might not be quite accurate. A very young Sigourney was part of a play that Ingrid played the lead. It sounds like she might have been a student working behind the scenes. The interview is interesting, because she, Isabella, and Liv are all come across as intelligent and it is more like a casual conversation than the normal canned PR. Three interesting actresses talking about an interesting actress from the past.\n\nI watched Copycat again several months ago and it wasn't as good as I remembered it. The script is the real problem. Weaver and Hunter are both terrific.\n\nThe film had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as another serial killer movie: Se7ven, which was a huge hit\n\nI believe Weaver's time at Yale was helped some by meeting Christopher Durang and working with him on satirical cabarets.\n\nI love Sigourney. It's a shame she hasn't had a late-career part to revive interest in her acting but I guess she's been busy with the 800 Avatar sequels.\n\nShe is perfect in the Alien movies so I don't need to repeat what's been said about them.\n\nI think her performance in Working Girl gets better with each year. She really brings more to the part than what's on the page, and her Katherine retains a certain dignity even in the end with the \"bony ass\" comments directed at her. She deserved supporting in 1988 but that was such a tough year in both leading and supporting, for which Weaver was nominated in both categories.\n\nMap of the World is very underrated. Weaver is captivating in the lead role, even though the character is not always sympathetic.\n\nI'm shocked she was not nominated for The Ice Storm. She was brilliant.\n\nBaby Mama is a terrible movie but Sigourney's supporting role is a scene-stealer, as is her cameo in Jeffrey.\n\nNo one is talking about Ghostbusters, but this is where I think she looked her prettiest!\n\nWhen I was a kid we used to joke about what a weird name Sigourney is. We thought she was really named that! We used to laugh at how weird it would be when her mom would call her home, \"Sigourney! It's time for dinner Sigourney!\""
