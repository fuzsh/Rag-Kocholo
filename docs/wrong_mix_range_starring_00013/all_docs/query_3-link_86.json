        "text": "A new four-hour documentary titled Aliens Expanded is in development and it promises fans that, “You’ll never watch Aliens the same way again” after watching it.\n\nThis is going to be the ultimate companion to James Cameron’s 1986 sci-fi action classic, and it features interviews with director James Cameron and franchise star Sigourney Weaver!\n\nWeaver will share “untold experiences from the set of Aliens, how Ripley’s world evolved in the sequel, and how the film has become a science-fiction classic.”\n\nThe doc was directed by Ian Nathan, who said in a statement: “Having Sigourney Weaver join Aliens Expanded is a crowning achievement.\n\n“Ripley is the heart of the film, the heart of the story, and Sigourney gave one of the defining performances of her career in Aliens. With her wonderful memories and thoughts, this documentary serves as the essential companion to the Alien universe.\n\n“It is an honour to work with Sigourney, and I can’t wait for everyone to see what she brings to the documentary!”\n\nRobin Block, CEO of CREATORVC and producer of Aliens Expanded, added: “Ripley is a history-making character who changed the game in genre film.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Sigourney Weaver into the fold of the documentary, joining her colleagues James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, Paul Reiser and more.\n\n“With her addition to the film, we are certain that fans will find Aliens Expanded to be the definitive documentary on the history-making film that changed cinema.”\n\nSigourney Weaver’s portrayal of Ripley is “considered one of the greatest characters in science-fiction, known for challenging gender roles in genre films and for changing the course of film history.\n\n“The role of Ripley in Aliens also earned Weaver her first Academy Award nomination, a landmark achievement given the fact that the Academy had given little recognition to science-fiction and genre films.”\n\nAliens Expanded supporters can be a part of the project with pre-order packages made available at www.aliens-expanded.com, now extended until May 13,2024.\n\nAliens Expanded is slated for limited release in June 2024. As a longtime fan of Aliens, I’m excited to watch this documentary!"
