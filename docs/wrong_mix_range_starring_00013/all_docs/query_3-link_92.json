        "text": "Exclusive: Sigourney Weaver Returning In Galaxy Quest Series\n\nBy Erika Hanson |\n\nSigourney Weaver is making a surprise return to one of her best sci-fi roles, and no, we aren’t talking about Ellen Ripley in Alien. Our trusted and proven sources tell us that the 73-year-old actress will reprise her role as Gwen DeMarco in the Galaxy Quest series on Paramount+. She will serve as a mentor for a brand new cast aboard the Protector.\n\nWe’ve exclusively learned that Sigourney Weaver will reprise her role as Gwen DeMarco and serve as a mentor in the Galaxy Quest series.\n\nAfter years of speculation, Paramount made it official that the TV show was, in fact, a go. In April 2023, the studio announced it would premiere on streaming. The series will once again be produced by Mark Johnson, but all we know for sure about the highly-anticipated project is that Sigourney Weaver is reprising her Galaxy Quest role to guide a new generation of cast members.\n\nGalaxy Quest Delays and Setbacks\n\nFor fans of the sci-fi comedy, the confirmation that a series was really happening was major, as plans for a follow-up project were held up for decades. Originally, a sequel would have seen Sigourney Weaver and the rest of the cast reprise their roles for another Galaxy Quest adventure. At one point, Mark Johnson had the original writer Robert Gordon and director Dean Parisot on board.\n\nIn 2015, the project officially became a series. It landed on Amazon, and was reportedly going to see all the major stars of the movie return. When that fell through, other names swirled around the project, including that of Simon Pegg and Georgia Pritchett, best known for her writing on Succession.\n\nOther details, including writers, directors, and cast joining the sci-fi parody for the series, remain a mystery. Besides Sigourney Weaver, the original Galaxy Quest film starred Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber.\n\nTim Allen has expressed a desire to return to Galaxy Quest for a new project over the years, so the chance of his return to the series in some form is likely. Unfortunately, we won’t see one of the greatest characters in the show, as Alan Rickman passed away in 2016.\n\nNow that we know Sigourney Weaver is returning to mentor a new cast, it is likely that we will see an entirely new crew aboard the Protector – the name of the made-up ship in which the characters of the movie filmed their sci-fi tv show.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the premise of Galaxy Quest, the 1999 movie followed the cast of a fictional sci-fi TV show. It was a parody of popular sci-fi media like Star Trek. In the movie, the cast finds themselves in the middle of an actual space battle with an alien race.\n\nTim Allen has expressed a desire to return to Galaxy Quest for a new project over the years, so the chance of his return to the series in some form is likely.\n\nSigourney Weaver’s Galaxy Quest was in no way a massive blockbuster hit when it premiered. However, it was adored by fans of Star Trek and other sci-fi series, and it has since earned its status as a cult classic. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds an impressive 90 percent score among critics and has a 79 percent audience rating."
