        "text": "Galaxy Quest is such a funny spoof of Star Trek and its fandom that it can be easy to overlook how good Sigourney Weaver is in it. She plays Gwen DeMarco, a former cast member on a popular science fiction TV program. With the show long off the air, she and her castmates travel the convention circuit, trading in on the glory they once had. One day, they're visited by a real alien race who, mistaking them for actual intergalactic heroes, enlist the actors to help them fend off a warlord looking to wipe them out.\n\nLike Ghostbusters, Galaxy Quest is largely male-centered. Weaver is the prominent female. Tim Allen, Alan Rickman, and Sam Rockwell get a lot of the best material, yet Weaver manages to be every bit as funny as any of them. She makes Gwen someone who knows she was treated like “eye candy” on the TV show and strives to break that image at the same time that she also kind of wants to embrace it. In a picture with lots of outrageous humor, she single-handedly infuses it with something more human, all while equaling the boys in the laugh-earning department.\n\nThe vast majority of Sigourney Weaver's movies have been aimed at adult audiences, so it's a little shocking to see her in the PG-rated Disney flick Holes. She plays the warden at Camp Green Lake, a youth detention center in the middle of the desert. This authority figure takes great pleasure in making her young inmates suffer, partially by forcing them to dig 5-foot-deep holes in the ground for no apparent reason. Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) intensely dislikes the warden, and he sets out to prove his theory that she's secretly looking for something that's been buried.\n\nWith Holes, Weaver takes what could have been a paper-thin villain and gives her a whole interior life. We do indeed sense desperation beneath her malice. That desperation is amped up by Stanley getting wise to her intent, leading her to fight harder for self-protection. Having an antagonist with multiple dimensions like that allows the story to generate the maximum amount of suspense. Perhaps best of all, Holes introduced Weaver to a whole new generation of moviegoers.\n\nSigourney Weaver got one of her three Oscar nominations for 1988's Working Girl. The film tells the story of Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), an ambitious receptionist who decides to get a little revenge on Katherine Parker, the stockbroker boss who betrayed her by taking credit for a potential merger she conceived. When Katherine is temporarily decommissioned due to a leg injury, Tess springs into action, essentially stepping into the leadership role and starting to push the merger through. Complicating matters is that she falls in love with Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), a representative from another company. He's romantically involved with Katherine, as well.\n\nNasty bosses are a cinematic cliché. Weaver deftly avoids all the stereotypes, though, creating a character shrewd enough to realize that being a no-nonsense shark is the only way to survive in the male-dominated business world. Even as we root for Tess and against Katherine, the actress encourages us to feel a little empathy. Katherine is a three-dimensional character in her hands, so we recognize that she's dealing with her own feelings and ambitions underneath the icy-cold exterior.\n\nSigourney Weaver plays Dian Fossey, the famed primatologist who studied gorillas in the forests of Rwanda and Uganda, in Gorillas in the Mist. The movie shows how she forms a bond with her subjects, gaining their trust and acceptance, and essentially living among them as she carries out her research. Realizing there's a danger of them going extinct because of poachers, she takes efforts to preserve the gorillas, only to inflame the anger of those who seek to exploit them. Her death at the hands of those poachers is also covered. Directed by Michael Apted, the film provides an engaging and informative overview of Fossey's groundbreaking work.\n\nFor the role, Weaver received an Oscar nomination. It's easy to see why. She conveys two important qualities about Fossey - the patience that allowed her to get close to the gorillas, and the fiery passion that led her to fight tooth-and-nail against the various entities that were imperiling them. Gorillas in the Mist came out the same year Weaver was also Oscar-nominated for Working Girl, and just two years after her nomination for Aliens. It represents the actress at the precise moment where she established herself as a major star, capable of delivering high-quality, artistic films that also offered abundant entertainment value.\n\nIn Heartbreakers, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother/daughter con artist team. Max seduces wealthy men and convinces them to marry her. Then Page shows up to seduce them, so that Max can “catch” them in a compromising position and arrange a financially lucrative divorce settlement. Their latest target is William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), an aging former tobacco executive with health issues. Trouble really comes when Page falls in love with another guy they're trying to con, threatening to put the whole partnership in jeopardy.\n\nThe potential pitfall of con artist movies is making the characters feel false. If we don't believe the marks are falling for the con, the story won't work. Weaver brings the funny, without going so far over the top that Heartbreakers loses its way. She captures Max's intelligence, as well as the way she recognizes the need to find each victim's weakness. Her scenes with the equally good Hewitt are fun because of the comedic dynamic they make together. This is a very funny film that has never quite gotten the love it deserves.\n\nThe success of 1991's The Silence of the Lambs triggered a slew of serial killer films that lasted for most of the decade. Sigourney Weaver was in one of them. Copycat casts her as Dr. Helen Hudson, a psychiatrist dealing with the traumatic aftereffects of having been assaulted by one of her previous patients, the deranged Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick, Jr.). She's become agoraphobic as a result. Helen is called back into action when homicide detective M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) seeks her help in identifying a serial killer whose modus operandi is to copy the killing style of other serial killers. And when it turns out Cullum may have valuable insight, she has to confront the horrors of her past.\n\nWhereas many of the ‘90s serial killer flicks were ripoffs of Lambs, Copycat finds its own footing, thanks to Weaver’s dynamic performance. She clearly put a great deal of effort into portraying trauma and agoraphobia accurately. Because she does that, the entire movie has a jittery vibe. We feel Helen's fear, and worry about what will happen as events put her closer to Cullum, the killer, and the realization she can't stay hidden inside forever. Gruesome subject matter makes the film exciting, but it's Weaver's work that gives it a true pulse."
