        "text": "As the idea of who can portray an action hero has finally started to change, one character has always stood out: Ellen Louise Ripley. It is a sign of the profound impact that Alien and its lead character had, that more than 40 years later, aged 71, Sigourney Weaver is still talking about the role that turned her into an international superstar.\n\n“I think all of us on Alien are very pleased the film still resonates with people,” Weaver says. “Ripley was written as a kind of everyperson, and it was unusual, then especially, not to have a woman go, ‘Oh my goodness’ [and be in distress]. Ridley Scott did not want that, neither did I, and I think now we’re so far from that in terms of women’s strength and situation. We have a long way to go, but it’s changing rapidly.”\n\nFor the sequel, Aliens, Weaver worked with James Cameron for the first time. Recently she reunited with the director to work on the Avatar films, playing exobiologist Dr Grace Augustine, leader of the AVTR (Avatar) programme on the film’s fictional moon of Pandora. She has already shot scenes for four sequels. I ask how the process of appearing in sci-fi blockbusters has changed over time.\n\nIt’s always a shock to see how people imagine you. They painted me out to be a very glamorous big star. Well, I am on the red carpet, I suppose. But not in real life\n\n“Actually, I’ve never worked in front of a green screen. I think I did one shot for Ghostbusters a long time ago,” she replies. “On Avatar, although we’re clothed in costumes with little [motion-capture] buttons, the acting experience is very much the same.\n\n“I think that’s part of the actor’s job when approaching these big projects that are all CGI – to be grounded and work very directly with your fellow actors as if it were a rehearsal for a play. So I feel like acting in these films has intensified my theatre roots in a way.”\n\nThose roots include her Tony-nominated turn in David Rabe’s drug-fuelled play about Hollywood, Hurlyburly, on Broadway in 1984. Now, she finds herself sending up the entertainment industry once again – as a guest star in the fourth and final season of the hit French series Call My Agent!.\n\nWeaver, who speaks fluent French, is the first international star to appear in the Netflix show about a fictional French agency dealing with the crazy demands of its stars. She was a fan before she joined the show, she tells me over Zoom during Canneseries, the television festival that has been pitched as the small-screen partner to the famed film festival.\n\n“It was the first time in my life that I’ve said yes to a part without reading a script,” she says. In the season’s fifth episode, titled “Sigourney”, she plays herself, and is depicted as a bit of a diva – which she argues is far from the truth. “It’s always a shock to see how people imagine you,” says the actress. “And in this case, they painted me out to be a very glamorous big star. Well, I am on the red carpet, I suppose. But not in real life.”\n\nShe admits that she found it “weird” playing herself. And although it is someone else’s version of her, she wanted the part to have some truth to it. “We changed a few things in the script so that they weren’t completely opposite to what I would do.”\n\nHeritage\n\nWeaver was born into the entertainment industry. Her father, Sylvester Weaver, was president of NBC between 1953 and 1955 having launched the still-running Today show in 1952. Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis, was an English stage actress who had a small role in Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps.\n\nOf showbusiness, she says, “Everyone knows it has its tough side. In my father’s day, people around him were afraid that whatever they had now in the business was dying. And he knew that wouldn’t happen – that the more forms of entertainment you put out, the better it would be.”\n\nWeaver shares her father’s optimism. She believes cinema will survive the twin threats of coronavirus and the growth of streaming services. “Maybe the theatrical experience will be different, but I think there is nothing like coming together with other people and watching a movie. Maybe that will be less common but I do not doubt that this business, like many others, will come back stronger.”\n\nWhen the first lockdown began, she had just returned to New York from the Berlin Film Festival, which opened with My Salinger Year, an adaptation of Joanna Rakoff’s novel, in which Weaver plays Margaret, a literary agent who looks after the works of JD Salinger and doesn’t believe in computers. “Margaret is tough,” she says, “but inside she’s very afraid because her world is collapsing.\n\n“What I love about this story is that I go from being someone who is formidable and suspicious to someone who is mentoring this young woman [Joanna, an assistant at the agency, played by Margaret Qualley] and they become quite close.”\n\nIt is the type of role she thrives on, she says. “You shouldn’t play someone likeable all the time; you have to dig into the awful person and find the gold in them. That’s part of the fun of being an actor. I love playing awful people.”\n\nLockdown was spent with her husband, the stage director Jim Simpson, and their daughter, Charlotte. “I feel like the whole world has been given a pause to reflect on where we’re going,” she says. “If we can change our behaviour that quickly for Covid, we can change our behaviour to protect the planet and each other.”\n\nOn a positive personal note, she adds, “Despite the tragedy of the pandemic, there have been some wonderful times for families to be together in a very unexpected way. My daughter turned 30 with us, which is probably not ideal for a 30-year-old. I have a very close relationship with her, closer than my relationship with my mother; she was very formal because she was English.”\n\nWhile her mother quit acting when she married her father, Weaver’s career has never had a lull. And she has a theory as to why. “First of all, I try not to believe in all those clichés that actresses don’t work after 40,” she says. “I was lucky because I was never the romantic one, except in a few movies. I’m grateful for my choices because now I am getting older, what’s available to me is even more interesting.”"
