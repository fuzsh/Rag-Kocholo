V/A Desperate Teenage Lovedolls LP

The soundtrack to We Got Powers video extravaganza, there’s lots of great rock ’n’ roll. REDD KROSS appropriately dominates this disc, not only with their own tunes, but with members sitting in with WHITE FLAG as well. They are joined by BLACK FLAG, SIN 34 (WGPs “house band”), NIP DRIVERS, and DARKSIDE (?). Cool teen stuff!
