        "text": "WE STILL GOT POWER: THE FILMS OF DAVE MARKEY\n\nDavid Markey has sustained a truly independent career in the shadow of Hollywood and against the backdrop of corporate America for over three decades. As a filmmaker, photographer and musician, Markey brings together underground music, experimental cinema and contemporary culture in a direct and insightful way. His body of work is also historically significant, representing a unique record of the punk scene in Southern California throughout the 1980’s and into the 1990’s. His indefatigable DIY aesthetic continues to drive him, as well as inspire a new generation of filmmakers, musicians and artists, and Spectacle is proud to present a selection of his films, from his earliest shorts to the 2008 festival favorite THE REINACTORS.\n\nTHE REINACTORS\n\nDir. Dave Markey, 2008.\n\nUSA. 96 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 3 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, JUNE 7 – 10:00 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 23 – 7:30 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nA documentary feature about the exploits and misadventures of film character impersonators and celebrity look-a-likes on Hollywood Boulevard over the span of a year. Freddy Krueger works alongside Superman, Marilyn Monroe, Shrek, Lucy, Batman, and Borat. Competing Chewbacca’s, Spidermen and Captain Jack Sparrow’s vie for a spot on the limited real estate of The Walk Of Fame. These street characters have big dreams of breaking into the big-time, in the meantime they forge a living one-dollar at a time, posing for photos with tourists. These characters are literally right out of the movies, yet the unforeseen drama of the people underneath the make-up threatens to eclipse the bizarre array of Hollywood film icons they appropriate. Director David Markey says, “THE REINACTORS plays like a great-depression era Hollywood classic retold for the new millennium. It’s also a film about the cutthroat nature backstage and behind the scenes of show business. An American Idol on crack, if you will.”\n\nDESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS\n\nDir. Dave Markey, 1984.\n\nUSA. 50 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 10 – MIDNIGHT\n\nTUESDAY, JUNE 21 – 10:00 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\n“In the way good punk music inspires you to form a band, David Markey’s DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS makes it seem easy and fun to make your own movie.” —L.A. Weekly\n\nDESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS was received as an instant cult classic when first released on the Los Angeles punk underground in 1984. Since then, the no budget super 8 film has gained international and aboveground praise. Bunny, Kitty, & Patch (Hilary Rubens, Jennifer Schwartz, & Janet Housden) are three teenage runaways who form the hottest all-girl band of all-time, The Lovedolls. Their meteoric rise to the top from a drug addled street life in Hollywood comes not without a price, thanks to sleazy rock manager, Johnny Tremaine (Steve McDonald). Rival all-girl gang The She Devils and their leader Tanya Hearst (Tracy Lea) have it in for our heroes, as do annoying mothers and psyche ward doctors. The film also features Jeff McDonald, Phil Newman, Vicki Peterson, Annette Zilinskas & Dez Cadena. Directed by David Markey, the saga is continued in the 1986 sequel LOVEDOLLS SUPERSTAR.\n\nLOVEDOLLS SUPERSTAR\n\nDir. Dave Markey, 1986.\n\nUSA. 90 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nSATURDAY, JUNE 11 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSUNDAY, JUNE 19 – 7:30 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nThe 2004 restored Directors Cut of the 1986 sequel to DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS, LOVEDOLLS SUPERSTAR which features the return of the beloved all-girl band The Lovedolls from their untimely demise. Patch Kelley (Janet Housden) is now Patch Christ, the leader of a religious cult who rescues Kitty Karryall (Jennifer Schwartz) from a boozy, wasted life. They recruit Sunset Boulevard hooker Alexandria “Cheetah” Axethrasher (Kim Pilkington) to replace the murdered Bunny Tremelo (Hilary Rubens). Rainbow Tremaine (Steven McDonald), from the Freedom School in New Mexico ventures to Hollywood only to discover his twin brother Johnny committed suicide after taking The Lovedolls to the top. Tracy Lea also returns, portraying the mother of She Devils’ slain leader Tanya Hearst, Patricia Ann Cloverfield. Meanwhile obsessed fanatic Carl Celery (Jeff McDonald) lives in his own world of Lovedoll worship, only to carry out an assassination of Brews Springstien (Jordan Schwartz).

Dave Markey, 1997.\n\nUSA. 90 min.\n\nIn English and Japanese.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 1 – 10:00 PM\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 17 – 10:00 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 22 – 7:30 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nTravel the USA with Osaka Japan’s beloved Shonen Knife, and see the sights through their eyes and hear the band at their best.

Total running time: 90 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 8 – 10:00 PM\n\nSUNDAY, JUNE 26 – 5:00 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nThurston Moore, Kim Gordon, Jordan Schwartz, Jennifer Schwartz, & Sofia Coppola.\n\nMusic by Devo, Ciccone Youth, Sonic Youth, The Shaggs, The Posies, Eyes Adrift, Oddio Gasser, Algebra Suicide, & Abby Travis.\n\nThis collection represents a sampling of 30 years of work (and life) from Los Angeles native independent filmmaker David Markey. From his beginnings as a pre-teen experimental film auteur to his music videos for major labels, “Cut Shorts” displays Markey’s unique and skewed view. From friends turned actors, to apartment buildings and alleyways turned backlot, a utilitarian surreal quality quickly surfaces. Certain masks, wigs, and actors appear throughout. The early work plays not unlike the music videos Markey would direct decades later (often shooting and editing himself.) Some are “Instant Films” conceived and shot within the same day. Others are warm-ups for feature films (DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS, LOVEDOLLS SUPERSTAR, and 1991 THE YEAR PUNK BROKE.)\n\nMarkey employs a frenetic documentary-style approach mixed with punk fiction on the dime (literally). Economic constrains don’t deter Dave’s creativity, but provide an aesthetic that weaves these 20 disparate pieces together. Fueled by the energy and brilliance of LA bands X, The Germs, Black Flag, Red Cross, and countless others, Markey feverishly produced these backyard films much like the Do-It-Yourself attitude found in punk zines and bands and a twisted sense of humor often at the expense of American Pop Culture.\n\nTHE SLOG MOVIE\n\nDir. Dave Markey, 1982.\n\nUSA. 53 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nwith DINE-O-MITE\n\nDir. Dave Markey,1976–77.\n\nUSA, 5 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nand MOVIE OF MOVIES\n\nDir.

A unique look at an era, left of field even by it’s peers The Decline Of Western Civilization and Another State Of Mind.
