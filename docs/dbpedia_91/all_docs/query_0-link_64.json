        "text": "ConnectHook Feb 2016\n\nby John Greenleaf Whittier (1807 – 1892)\n\n“As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark, so Good Spirits which be Angels of Light are augmented not only by the Divine Light of the Sun, but also by our common Wood fire: and as the celestial Fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our Fire of Wood doth the same.”\n\nCOR. AGRIPPA,\n\nOccult Philosophy, Book I. chap. v.\n\n“Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,\n\nArrives the snow; and, driving o’er the fields,\n\nSeems nowhere to alight; the whited air\n\nHides hills and woods, the river and the heaven,\n\nAnd veils the farm-house at the garden’s end.\n\nThe sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet\n\nDelayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit\n\nAround the radiant fireplace, enclosed\n\nIn a tumultuous privacy of storm.”\n\nEMERSON\n\nThe sun that brief December day\n\nRose cheerless over hills of gray,\n\nAnd, darkly circled, gave at noon\n\nA sadder light than waning moon.\n\nSlow tracing down the thickening sky\n\nIts mute and ominous prophecy,\n\nA portent seeming less than threat,\n\nIt sank from sight before it set.\n\nA chill no coat, however stout,\n\nOf homespun stuff could quite shut out,\n\nA hard, dull bitterness of cold,\n\nThat checked, mid-vein, the circling race\n\nOf life-blood in the sharpened face,\n\nThe coming of the snow-storm told.\n\nThe wind blew east; we heard the roar\n\nOf Ocean on his wintry shore,\n\nAnd felt the strong pulse throbbing there\n\nBeat with low rhythm our inland air.\n\nMeanwhile we did our nightly chores, —\n\nBrought in the wood from out of doors,\n\nLittered the stalls, and from the mows\n\nRaked down the herd’s-grass for the cows;\n\nHeard the horse whinnying for his corn;\n\nAnd, sharply clashing horn on horn,\n\nImpatient down the stanchion rows\n\nThe cattle shake their walnut bows;\n\nWhile, peering from his early perch\n\nUpon the scaffold’s pole of birch,\n\nThe **** his crested helmet bent\n\nAnd down his querulous challenge sent.\n\nUnwarmed by any sunset light\n\nThe gray day darkened into night,\n\nA night made hoary with the swarm\n\nAnd whirl-dance of the blinding storm,\n\nAs zigzag, wavering to and fro,\n\nCrossed and recrossed the wingàd snow:\n\nAnd ere the early bedtime came\n\nThe white drift piled the window-frame,\n\nAnd through the glass the clothes-line posts\n\nLooked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.\n\nSo all night long the storm roared on:\n\nThe morning broke without a sun;\n\nIn tiny spherule traced with lines\n\nOf Nature’s geometric signs,\n\nAnd, when the second morning shone,\n\nWe looked upon a world unknown,\n\nOn nothing we could call our own.\n\nAround the glistening wonder bent\n\nThe blue walls of the firmament,\n\nNo cloud above, no earth below, —\n\nA universe of sky and snow!\n\nThe old familiar sights of ours\n\nTook marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers\n\nRose up where sty or corn-crib stood,\n\nOr garden-wall, or belt of wood;\n\nA smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,\n\nA fenceless drift what once was road;\n\nThe bridle-post an old man sat\n\nWith loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;\n\nThe well-curb had a Chinese roof;\n\nAnd even the long sweep, high aloof,\n\nIn its slant spendor, seemed to tell\n\nOf Pisa’s leaning miracle.\n\nA prompt, decisive man, no breath\n\nOur father wasted: “Boys, a path!”\n\nWell pleased, (for when did farmer boy\n\nCount such a summons less than joy?)\n\nOur buskins on our feet we drew;\n\nWith mittened hands, and caps drawn low,\n\nTo guard our necks and ears from snow,\n\nWe cut the solid whiteness through.\n\nAnd, where the drift was deepest, made\n\nA tunnel walled and overlaid\n\nWith dazzling crystal: we had read\n\nOf rare Aladdin’s wondrous cave,\n\nAnd to our own his name we gave,\n\nWith many a wish the luck were ours\n\nTo test his lamp’s supernal powers.\n\nWe reached the barn with merry din,\n\nAnd roused the prisoned brutes within.\n\nThe old horse ****** his long head out,\n\nAnd grave with wonder gazed about;\n\nThe **** his ***** greeting said,\n\nAnd forth his speckled harem led;\n\nThe oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,\n\nAnd mild reproach of hunger looked;\n\nThe hornëd patriarch of the sheep,\n\nLike Egypt’s Amun roused from sleep,\n\nShook his sage head with gesture mute,\n\nAnd emphasized with stamp of foot.\n\nAll day the gusty north-wind bore\n\nThe loosening drift its breath before;\n\nLow circling round its southern zone,\n\nThe sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.\n\nNo church-bell lent its Christian tone\n\nTo the savage air, no social smoke\n\nCurled over woods of snow-hung oak.\n\nA solitude made more intense\n\nBy dreary-voicëd elements,\n\nThe shrieking of the mindless wind,\n\nThe moaning tree-boughs swaying blind,\n\nAnd on the glass the unmeaning beat\n\nOf ghostly finger-tips of sleet.\n\nBeyond the circle of our hearth\n\nNo welcome sound of toil or mirth\n\nUnbound the spell, and testified\n\nOf human life and thought outside.\n\nWe minded that the sharpest ear\n\nThe buried brooklet could not hear,\n\nThe music of whose liquid lip\n\nHad been to us companionship,\n\nAnd, in our lonely life, had grown\n\nTo have an almost human tone.\n\nAs night drew on, and, from the crest\n\nOf wooded knolls that ridged the west,\n\nThe sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank\n\nFrom sight beneath the smothering bank,\n\nWe piled, with care, our nightly stack\n\nOf wood against the chimney-back, —\n\nThe oaken log, green, huge, and thick,\n\nAnd on its top the stout back-stick;\n\nThe knotty forestick laid apart,\n\nAnd filled between with curious art\n\nThe ragged brush; then, hovering near,\n\nWe watched the first red blaze appear,\n\nHeard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam\n\nOn whitewashed wall and sagging beam,\n\nUntil the old, rude-furnished room\n\nBurst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;\n\nWhile radiant with a mimic flame\n\nOutside the sparkling drift became,\n\nAnd through the bare-boughed lilac-tree\n\nOur own warm hearth seemed blazing free.\n\nThe crane and pendent trammels showed,\n\nThe Turks’ heads on the andirons glowed;\n\nWhile childish fancy, prompt to tell\n\nThe meaning of the miracle,\n\nWhispered the old rhyme: “Under the tree,\n\nWhen fire outdoors burns merrily,\n\nThere the witches are making tea.”\n\nThe moon above the eastern wood\n\nShone at its full; the hill-range stood\n\nTransfigured in the silver flood,\n\nIts blown snows flashing cold and keen,\n\nDead white, save where some sharp ravine\n\nTook shadow, or the sombre green\n\nOf hemlocks turned to pitchy black\n\nAgainst the whiteness at their back.\n\nFor such a world and such a night\n\nMost fitting that unwarming light,\n\nWhich only seemed where’er it fell\n\nTo make the coldness visible.\n\nShut in from all the world without,\n\nWe sat the clean-winged hearth about,\n\nContent to let the north-wind roar\n\nIn baffled rage at pane and door,\n\nWhile the red logs before us beat\n\nThe frost-line back with tropic heat;\n\nAnd ever, when a louder blast\n\nShook beam and rafter as it passed,\n\nThe merrier up its roaring draught\n\nThe great throat of the chimney laughed;\n\nThe house-dog on his paws outspread\n\nLaid to the fire his drowsy head,\n\nThe cat’s dark silhouette on the wall\n\nA couchant tiger’s seemed to fall;\n\nAnd, for the winter fireside meet,\n\nBetween the andirons’ straddling feet,\n\nThe mug of cider simmered slow,\n\nThe apples sputtered in a row,\n\nAnd, close at hand, the basket stood\n\nWith nuts from brown October’s wood.\n\nWhat matter how the night behaved?\n\nWhat matter how the north-wind raved?\n\nBlow high, blow low, not all its snow\n\nCould quench our hearth-fire’s ruddy glow.\n\nO Time and Change! — with hair as gray\n\nAs was my sire’s that winter day,\n\nHow strange it seems, with so much gone\n\nOf life and love, to still live on!\n\nAh, brother! only I and thou\n\nAre left of all that circle now, —\n\nThe dear home faces whereupon\n\nThat fitful firelight paled and shone.\n\nHenceforward, listen as we will,\n\nThe voices of that hearth are still;\n\nLook where we may, the wide earth o’er,\n\nThose lighted faces smile no more.\n\nWe tread the paths their feet have worn,\n\nWe sit beneath their orchard trees,\n\nWe hear, like them, the hum of bees\n\nAnd rustle of the bladed corn;\n\nWe turn the pages that they read,\n\nTheir written words we linger o’er,\n\nBut in the sun they cast no shade,\n\nNo voice is heard, no sign is made,\n\nNo step is on the conscious floor!\n\nYet Love will dream, and Faith will trust,\n\n(Since He who knows our need is just,)\n\nThat somehow, somewhere, meet we must.\n\nAlas for him who never sees\n\nThe stars shine through his cypress-trees!\n\nWho, hopeless, lays his dead away,\n\nNor looks to see the breaking day\n\nAcross the mournful marbles play!\n\nWho hath not learned, in hours of faith,\n\nThe truth to flesh and sense unknown,\n\nThat Life is ever lord of Death,\n\nAnd Love can never lose its own!\n\nWe sped the time with stories old,\n\nWrought puzzles out, and riddles told,\n\nOr stammered from our school-book lore\n\n“The Chief of Gambia’s golden shore.”\n\nHow often since, when all the land\n\nWas clay in Slavery’s shaping hand,\n\nAs if a far-blown trumpet stirred\n\nDame Mercy Warren’s rousing word:\n\n“Does not the voice of reason cry,\n\nClaim the first right which Nature gave,\n\nFrom the red scourge of ******* to fly,\n\nNor deign to live a burdened slave!”\n\nOur father rode again his ride\n\nOn Memphremagog’s wooded side;\n\nSat down again to moose and samp\n\nIn trapper’s hut and Indian camp;\n\nLived o’er the old idyllic ease\n\nBeneath St. François’ hemlock-trees;\n\nAgain for him the moonlight shone\n\nOn Norman cap and bodiced zone;\n\nAgain he heard the violin play\n\nWhich led the village dance away.\n\nAnd mingled in its merry whirl\n\nThe grandam and the laughing girl.\n\nOr, nearer home, our steps he led\n\nWhere Salisbury’s level marshes spread\n\nMile-wide as flies the laden bee;\n\nWhere merry mowers, hale and strong,\n\nSwept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along\n\nThe low green prairies of the sea.\n\nWe shared the fishing off Boar’s Head,\n\nAnd round the rocky Isles of Shoals\n\nThe hake-broil on the drift-wood coals;\n\nThe chowder on the sand-beach made,\n\nDipped by the hungry, steaming hot,\n\nWith spoons of clam-shell from the ***.\n\nWe heard the tales of witchcraft old,\n\nAnd dream and sign and marvel told\n\nTo sleepy listeners as they lay\n\nStretched idly on the salted hay,\n\nAdrift along the winding shores,\n\nWhen favoring breezes deigned to blow\n\nThe square sail of the gundelow\n\nAnd idle lay the useless oars.\n\nOur mother, while she turned her wheel\n\nOr run the new-knit stocking-heel,\n\nTold how the Indian hordes came down\n\nAt midnight on Concheco town,\n\nAnd how her own great-uncle bore\n\nHis cruel scalp-mark to fourscore.\n\nRecalling, in her fitting phrase,\n\nSo rich and picturesque and free\n\n(The common unrhymed poetry\n\nOf simple life and country ways,)\n\nThe story of her early days, —\n\nShe made us welcome to her home;\n\nOld hearths grew wide to give us room;\n\nWe stole with her a frightened look\n\nAt the gray wizard’s conjuring-book,\n\nThe fame whereof went far and wide\n\nThrough all the simple country side;\n\nWe heard the hawks at twilight play,\n\nThe boat-horn on Piscataqua,\n\nThe loon’s weird laughter far away;\n\nWe fished her little trout-brook, knew\n\nWhat flowers in wood and meadow grew,\n\nWhat sunny hillsides autumn-brown\n\nShe climbed to shake the ripe nuts down,\n\nSaw where in sheltered cove and bay,\n\nThe ducks’ black squadron anchored lay,\n\nAnd heard the wild-geese calling loud\n\nBeneath the gray November cloud.\n\nThen, haply, with a look more grave,\n\nAnd soberer tone, some tale she gave\n\nFrom painful Sewel’s ancient tome,\n\nBeloved in every Quaker home,\n\nOf faith fire-winged by martyrdom,\n\nOr Chalkley’s Journal, old and quaint, —\n\nGentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint! —\n\nWho, when the dreary calms prevailed,\n\nAnd water-**** and bread-cask failed,\n\nAnd cruel, hungry eyes pursued\n\nHis portly presence mad for food,\n\nWith dark hints muttered under breath\n\nOf casting lots for life or death,\n\nOffered, if Heaven withheld supplies,\n\nTo be himself the sacrifice.\n\nThen, suddenly, as if to save\n\nThe good man from his living grave,\n\nA ripple on the water grew,\n\nA school of porpoise flashed in view.\n\n“Take, eat,” he said, “and be content;\n\nThese fishes in my stead are sent\n\nBy Him who gave the tangled ram\n\nTo spare the child of Abraham.”\n\nOur uncle, innocent of books,\n\nWas rich in lore of fields and brooks,\n\nThe ancient teachers never dumb\n\nOf Nature’s unhoused lyceum.\n\nIn moons and tides and weather wise,\n\nHe read the clouds as prophecies,\n\nAnd foul or fair could well divine,\n\nBy many an occult hint and sign,\n\nHolding the cunning-warded keys\n\nTo all the woodcraft mysteries;\n\nHimself to Nature’s heart so near\n\nv That all her voices in his ear\n\nOf beast or bird had meanings clear,\n\nLike Apollonius of old,\n\nWho knew the tales the sparrows told,\n\nOr Hermes, who interpreted\n\nWhat the sage cranes of Nilus said;\n\nA simple, guileless, childlike man,\n\nContent to live where life began;\n\nStrong only on his native grounds,\n\nThe little world of sights and sounds\n\nWhose girdle was the parish bounds,\n\nWhereof his fondly partial pride\n\nThe common features magnified,\n\nAs Surrey hills to mountains grew\n\nIn White of Selborne’s loving view, —\n\nHe told how teal and loon he shot,\n\nAnd how the eagle’s eggs he got,\n\nThe feats on pond and river done,\n\nThe prodigies of rod and gun;\n\nTill, warming with the tales he told,\n\nForgotten was the outside cold,\n\nThe bitter wind unheeded blew,\n\nFrom ripening corn the pigeons flew,\n\nThe partridge drummed i’ the wood, the mink\n\nWent fishing down the river-brink.\n\nIn fields with bean or clover gay,\n\nThe woodchuck, like a hermit gray,\n\nPeered from the doorway of his cell;\n\nThe muskrat plied the mason’s trade,\n\nAnd tier by tier his mud-walls laid;\n\nAnd from the shagbark overhead\n\nThe grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.\n\nNext, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer\n\nAnd voice in dreams I see and hear, —\n\nThe sweetest woman ever Fate\n\nPerverse denied a household mate,\n\nWho, lonely, homeless, not the less\n\nFound peace in love’s unselfishness,\n\nAnd welcome wheresoe’er she went,\n\nA calm and gracious element,\n\nWhose presence seemed the sweet income\n\nAnd womanly atmosphere of home, —\n\nCalled up her girlhood memories,\n\nThe huskings and the apple-bees,\n\nThe sleigh-rides and the summer sails,\n\nWeaving through all the poor details\n\nAnd homespun warp of circumstance\n\nA golden woof-thread of romance.\n\nFor well she kept her genial mood\n\nAnd simple faith of maidenhood;\n\nBefore her still a cloud-land lay,\n\nThe mirage loomed across her way;\n\nThe morning dew, that dries so soon\n\nWith others, glistened at her noon;\n\nThrough years of toil and soil and care,\n\nFrom glossy tress to thin gray hair,\n\nAll unprofaned she held apart\n\nThe ****** fancies of the heart.\n\nBe shame to him of woman born\n\nWho hath for such but thought of scorn.\n\nThere, too, our elder sister plied\n\nHer evening task the stand beside;\n\nA full, rich nature, free to trust,\n\nTruthful and almost sternly just,\n\nImpulsive, earnest, prompt to act,\n\nAnd make her generous thought a fact,\n\nKeeping with many a light disguise\n\nThe secret of self-sacrifice.\n\nO heart sore-tried! thou hast the best\n\nThat Heaven itself could give thee, — rest,\n\nRest from all bitter thoughts and things!\n\nHow many a poor one’s blessing went\n\nWith thee beneath the low green tent\n\nWhose curtain never outward swings!\n\nAs one who held herself a part\n\nOf all she saw, and let her heart\n\nAgainst the household ***** lean,\n\nUpon the motley-braided mat\n\nOur youngest and our dearest sat,\n\nLifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,\n\nNow bathed in the unfading green\n\nAnd holy peace of Paradise.\n\nOh, looking from some heavenly hill,\n\nOr from the shade of saintly palms,\n\nOr silver reach of river calms,\n\nDo those large eyes behold me still?\n\nWith me one little year ago: —\n\nThe chill weight of the winter snow\n\nFor months upon her grave has lain;\n\nAnd now, when summer south-winds blow\n\nAnd brier and harebell bloom again,\n\nI tread the pleasant paths we trod,\n\nI see the violet-sprinkled sod\n\nWhereon she leaned, too frail and weak\n\nThe hillside flowers she loved to seek,\n\nYet following me where’er I went\n\nWith dark eyes full of love’s content.\n\nThe birds are glad; the brier-rose fills\n\nThe air with sweetness; all the hills\n\nStretch green to June’s unclouded sky;\n\nBut still I wait with ear and eye\n\nFor something gone which should be nigh,\n\nA loss in all familiar things,\n\nIn flower that blooms, and bird that sings.\n\nAnd yet, dear heart! remembering thee,\n\nAm I not richer than of old?\n\nSafe in thy immortality,\n\nWhat change can reach the wealth I hold?\n\nWhat chance can mar the pearl and gold\n\nThy love hath left in trust with me?\n\nAnd while in life’s late afternoon,\n\nWhere cool and long the shadows grow,\n\nI walk to meet the night that soon\n\nShall shape and shadow overflow,\n\nI cannot feel that thou art far,\n\nSince near at need the angels are;\n\nAnd when the sunset gates unbar,\n\nShall I not see thee waiting stand,\n\nAnd, white against the evening star,\n\nThe welcome of thy beckoning hand?\n\nBrisk wielder of the birch and rule,\n\nThe master of the district school\n\nHeld at the fire his favored place,\n\nIts warm glow lit a laughing face\n\nFresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared\n\nThe uncertain prophecy of beard.\n\nHe teased the mitten-blinded cat,\n\nPlayed cross-pins on my uncle’s hat,\n\nSang songs, and told us what befalls\n\nIn classic Dartmouth’s college halls.\n\nBorn the wild Northern hills among,\n\nFrom whence his yeoman father wrung\n\nBy patient toil subsistence scant,\n\nNot competence and yet not want,\n\nHe early gained the power to pay\n\nHis cheerful, self-reliant way;\n\nCould doff at ease his scholar’s gown\n\nTo peddle wares from town to town;\n\nOr through the long vacation’s reach\n\nIn lonely lowland districts teach,\n\nWhere all the droll experience found\n\nAt stranger hearths in boarding round,\n\nThe moonlit skater’s keen delight,\n\nThe sleigh-drive through the frosty night,\n\nThe rustic party, with its rough\n\nAccompaniment of blind-man’s-buff,\n\nAnd whirling-plate, and forfeits paid,\n\nHis winter task a pastime made.\n\nHappy the snow-locked homes wherein\n\nHe tuned his merry violin,\n\nOr played the athlete in the barn,\n\nOr held the good dame’s winding-yarn,\n\nOr mirth-provoking versions told\n\nOf classic legends rare and old,\n\nWherein the scenes of Greece and Rome\n\nHad all the commonplace of home,\n\nAnd little seemed at best the odds\n\n‘Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods;\n\nWhere Pindus-born Arachthus took\n\nThe guise of any grist-mill brook,\n\nAnd dread Olympus at his will\n\nBecame a huckleberry hill.\n\nA careless boy that night he seemed;\n\nBut at his desk he had the look\n\nAnd air of one who wisely schemed,\n\nAnd hostage from the future took\n\nIn trainëd thought and lore of book.\n\nLarge-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he\n\nShall Freedom’s young apostles be,\n\nWho, following in War’s ****** trail,\n\nShall every lingering wrong assail;\n\nAll chains from limb and spirit strike,\n\nUplift the black and white alike;\n\nScatter before their swift advance\n\nThe darkness and the ignorance,\n\nThe pride, the lust, the squalid sloth,\n\nWhich nurtured Treason’s monstrous growth,\n\nMade ****** pastime, and the hell\n\nOf prison-torture possible;\n\nThe cruel lie of caste refute,\n\nOld forms remould, and substitute\n\nFor Slavery’s lash the freeman’s will,\n\nFor blind routine, wise-handed skill;\n\nA school-house plant on every hill,\n\nStretching in radiate nerve-lines thence\n\nThe quick wires of intelligence;\n\nTill North and South together brought\n\nShall own the same electric thought,\n\nIn peace a common flag salute,\n\nAnd, side by side in labor’s free\n\nAnd unresentful rivalry,\n\nHarvest the fields wherein they fought.\n\nAnother guest that winter night\n\nFlashed back from lustrous eyes the light.\n\nUnmarked by time, and yet not young,\n\nThe honeyed music of her tongue\n\nAnd words of meekness scarcely told\n\nA nature passionate and bold,\n\nStrong, self-concentred, spurning guide,\n\nIts milder features dwarfed beside\n\nHer unbent will’s majestic pride.\n\nShe sat among us, at the best,\n\nA not unfeared, half-welcome guest,\n\nRebuking with her cultured phrase\n\nOur homeliness of words and ways.\n\nA certain pard-like, treacherous grace\n\nSwayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash,\n\nLent the white teeth their dazzling flash;\n\nAnd under low brows, black with night,\n\nRayed out at times a dangerous light;\n\nThe sharp heat-lightnings of her face\n\nPresaging ill to him whom Fate\n\nCondemned to share her love or hate.\n\nA woman tropical, intense\n\nIn thought and act, in soul and sense,\n\nShe blended in a like degree\n\nThe ***** and the devotee,\n\nRevealing with each freak or feint\n\nThe temper of Petruchio’s Kate,\n\nThe raptures of Siena’s saint.\n\nHer tapering hand and rounded wrist\n\nHad facile power to form a fist;\n\nThe warm, dark languish of her eyes\n\nWas never safe from wrath’s surprise.\n\nBrows saintly calm and lips devout\n\nKnew every change of scowl and pout;\n\nAnd the sweet voice had notes more high\n\nAnd shrill for social battle-cry.\n\nSince then what old cathedral town\n\nHas missed her pilgrim staff and gown,\n\nWhat convent-gate has held its lock\n\nAgainst the challenge of her knock!\n\nThrough Smyrna’s plague-hushed thoroughfares,\n\nUp sea-set Malta’s rocky stairs,\n\nGray olive slopes of hills that hem\n\nThy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem,\n\nOr startling on her desert throne\n\nThe crazy Queen of Lebanon\n\nWith claims fantastic as her own,\n\nHer tireless feet have held their way;\n\nAnd still, unrestful, bowed, and gray,\n\nShe watches under Eastern skies,\n\nWith hope each day renewed and fresh,\n\nThe Lord’s quick coming in the flesh,\n\nWhereof she dreams and prophesies!\n\nWhere’er her troubled path may be,\n\nThe Lord’s sweet pity with her go!\n\nThe outward wayward life we see,\n\nThe hidden springs we may not know.\n\nNor is it given us to discern\n\nWhat threads the fatal sisters spun,\n\nThrough what ancestral years has run\n\nThe sorrow with the woman born,\n\nWhat forged her cruel chain of moods,\n\nWhat set her feet in solitudes,\n\nAnd held the love within her mute,\n\nWhat mingled madness in the blood,\n\nA life-long discord and annoy,\n\nWater of tears with oil of joy,\n\nAnd hid within the folded bud\n\nPerversities of flower and fruit.\n\nIt is not ours to separate\n\nThe tangled skein of will and fate,\n\nTo show what metes and bounds should stand\n\nUpon the soul’s debatable land,\n\nAnd between choice and Providence\n\nDivide the circle of events;\n\nBut He who knows our frame is just,\n\nMerciful and compassionate,\n\nAnd full of sweet assurances\n\nAnd hope for all the language is,\n\nThat He remembereth we are dust!\n\nAt last the great logs, crumbling low,\n\nSent out a dull and duller glow,\n\nThe bull’s-eye watch that hung in view,\n\nTicking its weary circuit through,\n\nPointed with mutely warning sign\n\nIts black hand to the hour of nine.\n\nThat sign the pleasant circle broke:\n\nMy uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,\n\nKnocked from its bowl the refuse gray,\n\nAnd laid it tenderly away;\n\nThen roused himself to safely cover\n\nThe dull red brands with ashes over.\n\nAnd while, with care, our mother laid\n\nThe work aside, her steps she stayed\n\nOne moment, seeking to express\n\nHer grateful sense of happiness\n\nFor food and shelter, warmth and health,\n\nAnd love’s contentment more than wealth,\n\nWith simple wishes (not the weak,\n\nVain prayers which no fulfilment seek,\n\nBut such as warm the generous heart,\n\nO’er-prompt to do with Heaven its part)\n\nThat none might lack, that bitter night,\n\nFor bread and clothing, warmth and light.\n\nWithin our beds awhile we heard\n\nThe wind that round the gables roared,\n\nWith now and then a ruder shock,\n\nWhich made our very bedsteads rock.\n\nWe heard the loosened clapboards tost,\n\nThe board-nails snapping in the frost;\n\nAnd on us, through the unplastered wall,\n\nFelt the light sifted snow-flakes fall.\n\nBut sleep stole on, as sleep will do\n\nWhen hearts are light and life is new;\n\nFaint and more faint the murmurs grew,\n\nTill in the summer-land of dreams\n\nThey softened to the sound of streams,\n\nLow stir of leaves, and dip of oars,\n\nAnd lapsing waves on quiet shores.\n\nOf merry voices high and clear;\n\nAnd saw the teamsters drawing near\n\nTo break the drifted highways out.\n\nDown the long hillside treading slow\n\nWe saw the half-buried oxen go,\n\nShaking the snow from heads uptost,\n\nTheir straining nostrils white with frost.\n\nBefore our door the straggling train\n\nDrew up, an added team to gain.\n\nThe elders threshed their hands a-cold,\n\nPassed, with the cider-mug, their jokes\n\nFrom lip to lip; the younger folks\n\nDown the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled,\n\nThen toiled again the cavalcade\n\nO’er windy hill, through clogged ravine,\n\nAnd woodland paths that wound between\n\nLow drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed.\n\nFrom every barn a team afoot,\n\nAt every house a new recruit,\n\nWhere, drawn by Nature’s subtlest law,\n\nHaply the watchful young men saw\n\nSweet doorway pictures of the curls\n\nAnd curious eyes of merry girls,\n\nLifting their hands in mock defence\n\nAgainst the snow-ball’s compliments,\n\nAnd reading in each missive tost\n\nThe charm with Eden never lost.\n\nWe heard once more the sleigh-bells’ sound;\n\nAnd, following where the teamsters led,\n\nThe wise old Doctor went his round,\n\nJust pausing at our door to say,\n\nIn the brief autocratic way\n\nOf one who, prompt at Duty’s call,\n\nWas free to urge her claim on all,\n\nThat some poor neighbor sick abed\n\nAt night our mother’s aid would need.\n\nFor, one in generous thought and deed,\n\nWhat mattered in the sufferer’s sight\n\nThe Quaker matron’s inward light,\n\nThe Doctor’s mail of Calvin’s creed?\n\nAll hearts confess the saints elect\n\nWho, twain in faith, in love agree,\n\nAnd melt not in an acid sect\n\nThe Christian pearl of charity!\n\nSo days went on: a week had passed\n\nSince the great world was heard from last.\n\nThe Almanac we studied o’er,\n\nRead and reread our little store\n\nOf books and pamphlets, scarce a score;\n\nOne harmless novel, mostly hid\n\nFrom younger eyes, a book forbid,\n\nAnd poetry, (or good or bad,\n\nA single book was all we had,)\n\nWhere Ellwood’s meek, drab-skirted Muse,\n\nA stranger to the heathen Nine,\n\nSang, with a somewhat nasal whine,\n\nThe wars of David and the Jews.\n\nAt last the floundering carrier bore\n\nThe village paper to our door.\n\nLo! broadening outward as we read,\n\nTo warmer zones the horizon spread\n\nIn panoramic length unrolled\n\nWe saw the marvels that it told.\n\nBefore us passed the painted Creeks,\n\nA nd daft McGregor on his raids\n\nIn Costa Rica’s everglades.\n\nAnd up Taygetos winding slow\n\nRode Ypsilanti’s Mainote Greeks,\n\nA Turk’s head at each saddle-bow!\n\nWelcome to us its week-old news,\n\nIts corner for the rustic Muse,\n\nIts monthly gauge of snow and rain,\n\nIts record, mingling in a breath\n\nThe wedding bell and dirge of death:\n\nJest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale,\n\nThe latest culprit sent to jail;\n\nIts hue and cry of stolen and lost,\n\nIts vendue sales and goods at cost,\n\nAnd traffic calling loud for gain.\n\nWe felt the stir of hall and street,\n\nThe pulse of life that round us beat;\n\nThe chill embargo of the snow\n\nWas melted in the genial glow;\n\nWide swung again our ice-locked door,\n\nAnd all the world was ours once more!\n\nClasp, Angel of the backword look\n\nAnd folded wings of ashen gray\n\nAnd voice of echoes far away,\n\nThe brazen covers of thy book;\n\nThe weird palimpsest old and vast,\n\nWherein thou hid’st the spectral past;\n\nWhere, closely mingling, pale and glow\n\nThe characters of joy and woe;\n\nThe monographs of outlived years,\n\nOr smile-illumed or dim with tears,\n\nGreen hills of life that ***** to death,\n\nAnd haunts of home, whose vistaed trees\n\nShade off to mournful cypresses\n\nWith the white amaranths underneath.\n\nEven while I look, I can but heed\n\nThe restless sands’ incessant fall,\n\nImportunate hours that hours succeed,\n\nEach clamorous with its own sharp need,\n\nAnd duty keeping pace with all.\n\nShut down and clasp with heavy lids;\n\nI hear again the voice that bids\n\nThe dreamer leave his dream midway\n\nFor larger hopes and graver fears:\n\nLife greatens in these later years,\n\nThe century’s aloe flowers to-day!\n\nYet, haply, in some lull of life,\n\nSome Truce of God which breaks its strife,\n\nThe worldling’s eyes shall gather dew,\n\nDreaming in throngful city ways\n\nOf winter joys his boyhood knew;\n\nAnd dear and early friends — the few\n\nWho yet remain — shall pause to view\n\nThese Flemish pictures of old days;\n\nSit with me by the homestead hearth,\n\nAnd stretch the hands of memory forth\n\nTo warm them at the wood-fire’s blaze!\n\nAnd thanks untraced to lips unknown\n\nShall greet me like the odors blown\n\nFrom unseen meadows newly mown,\n\nWood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond;\n\nThe traveller owns the grateful sense\n\nOf sweetness near, he knows not whence,\n\nAnd, pausing, takes with forehead bare\n\nThe benediction of the air.\n\nWritten in 1865\n\nIn its day, 'twas a best-seller and earned significant

2020\n\nSonnets\n\nFor this collection I have used the original definition of \"sonnet\" as a \"little song\" rather than sticking to rigid formulas. The sonnets here include traditional sonnets, tetrameter sonnets, hexameter sonnets, curtal sonnets, 15-line sonnets, and some that probably defy categorization, which I call free verse sonnets for want of a better term. Most of these sonnets employ meter, rhyme and form and tend to be Romantic in the spirit of the Romanticism of Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth and Dylan Thomas.\n\nAuschwitz Rose\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere is a Rose at Auschwitz, in the briar,\n\na rose like Sharon's, lovely as her name.\n\nThe world forgot her, and is not the same.\n\nI still love her and enlist this sacred fire\n\nto keep her memory exalted flame\n\nunmolested by the thistles and the nettles.\n\nOn Auschwitz now the reddening sunset settles;\n\nthey sleep alike―diminutive and tall,\n\nthe innocent, the \"surgeons.\" Sleeping, all.\n\nRed oxides of her blood, bright crimson petals,\n\nif accidents of coloration, gall my heart no less.\n\nAmid thick weeds and muck\n\nthere lies a rose man's crackling lightning struck:\n\nthe only Rose I ever longed to pluck.\n\nSoon I'll bed there and bid the world \"Good Luck.\"\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nIn Praise of Meter\n\nby Michael R.

The ear needs no device\n\nto hear the unsprung rhythms of the couch\n\ndrown out the mouth's; the lips can be debauched\n\nby kisses, should the heart put back its watch\n\nand find the pulse of love, and sing, devout.\n\nIf moons and tides in interlocking dance\n\nobey their numbers, what's been left to chance?\n\nShould poets be more lax―their circumstance\n\nas humble as it is?―or readers wince\n\nto see their ragged numbers thin, to hear\n\nthe moans of drones drown out the Chanticleer?\n\nOriginally published by The Eclectic Muse and in The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nDiscrimination\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe meter I had sought to find, perplexed,\n\nwas ripped from books of \"verse\" that read like prose.\n\nI found it in sheet music, in long rows\n\nof hologramic CDs, in sad wrecks\n\nof long-forgotten volumes undisturbed\n\nhalf-centuries by archivists, unscanned.\n\nI read their fading numbers, frowned, perturbed―\n\nwhy should such tattered artistry be banned?\n\nI heard the sleigh bells’ jingles, vampish ads,\n\nthe supermodels’ babble, Seuss’s books\n\nextolled in major movies, blurbs for abs ...\n\nA few poor thinnish journals crammed in nooks\n\nare all I’ve found this late to sell to those\n\nwho’d classify free verse \"expensive prose.\"\n\nOriginally published by The Chariton Review\n\nThe Forge\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nFor all that I remembered, I forgot\n\nher name, her face, the reason that we loved ...\n\nand yet I hold her close within my thought.\n\nI feel the burnished weight of auburn hair\n\nthat fell across her face, the apricot\n\nclean scent of her shampoo, the way she glowed\n\nso palely in the moonlight, angel-wan.\n\nThe memory of her gathers like a flood\n\nand bears me to that night, that only night,\n\nwhen she and I were one, and if I could ...\n\nI'd reach to her this time and, smiling, brush\n\nthe hair out of her eyes, and hold intact\n\neach feature, each impression. Love is such\n\na threadbare sort of magic, it is gone\n\nbefore we recognize it. I would crush\n\nmy lips to hers to hold their memory,\n\nif not more tightly, less elusively.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nLeaf Fall\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhatever winds encountered soon resolved\n\nto swirling fragments, till chaotic heaps\n\nof leaves lay pulsing by the backyard wall.\n\nIn lieu of rakes, our fingers sorted each\n\ndry leaf into its place and built a high,\n\nsoft bastion against earth's gravitron―\n\na patchwork quilt, a trampoline, a bright\n\nimpediment to fling ourselves upon.\n\nAnd nothing in our laughter as we fell\n\ninto those leaves was like the autumn's cry\n\nof also falling. Nothing meant to die\n\ncould be so bright as we, so colorful―\n\nclad in our plaids, oblivious to pain\n\nwe'd feel today, should we leaf-fall again.\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nIsolde's Song\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThrough our long years of dreaming to be one\n\nwe grew toward an enigmatic light\n\nthat gently warmed our tendrils. Was it sun?\n\nWe had no eyes to tell; we loved despite\n\nthe lack of all sensation―all but one:\n\nwe felt the night's deep chill, the air so bright\n\nat dawn we quivered limply, overcome.\n\nTo touch was all we knew, and how to bask.\n\nWe knew to touch; we grew to touch; we felt\n\nspring's urgency, midsummer's heat, fall's lash,\n\nwild winter's ice and thaw and fervent melt.\n\nWe felt returning light and could not ask\n\nits meaning, or if something was withheld\n\nmore glorious. To touch seemed life's great task.\n\nAt last the petal of me learned: unfold.\n\nAnd you were there, surrounding me. We touched.\n\nThe curious golden pollens! Ah, we touched,\n\nand learned to cling and, finally, to hold.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nSee\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSee how her hair has thinned: it doesn't seem\n\nlike hair at all, but like the airy moult\n\nof emus who outraced the wind and left\n\nsoft plumage in their wake. See how her eyes\n\nare gentler now; see how each wrinkle laughs,\n\nand deepens on itself, as though mirth took\n\nsome comfort there and burrowed deeply in,\n\noutlasting winter. See how very thin\n\nher features are―that time has made more spare,\n\nso that each bone shows, elegant and rare.\n\nFor loveliness remains in her grave eyes,\n\nand courage in her still-delighted looks:\n\neach face presented like a picture book's.\n\nBemused, she blows us undismayed goodbyes.\n\nOriginally published by Writer's Digest's: The Year's Best Writing 2003\n\nIn the Whispering Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky,\n\nand the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our bodies to some violent ocean\n\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze:\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the world of resplendence from which we were seized.\n\nPublished in Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly and Poetry Life & Times. This is a sonnet I wrote for my favorite college English teacher, George King, about poetic kinship, brotherhood and romantic flights of fancy.\n\nThe Toast\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFor longings warmed by tepid suns\n\n(brief lusts that animated clay),\n\nfor passions wilted at the bud\n\nand skies grown desolate and gray,\n\nfor stars that fell from tinseled heights\n\nand mountains bleak and scarred and lone,\n\nfor seas reflecting distant suns\n\nand weeds that thrive where seeds were sown,\n\nfor waltzes ending in a hush,\n\nfor rhymes that fade as pages close,\n\nfor flames' exhausted, drifting ash,\n\nand petals falling from the rose, ...\n\nI raise my cup before I drink,\n\nsaluting ghosts of loves long dead,\n\nand silently propose a toast―\n\nto joys set free, and those I fled.\n\nSecond Sight (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n(Newborns see best at a distance of 8 to 14 inches.)\n\nWiser than we know, the newborn screams,\n\nred-faced from breath, and wonders what life means\n\nthis close to death, amid the arctic glare\n\nof warmthless lights above.\n\nBeware! Beware!―\n\nencrypted signals, codes? Or ciphers, noughts?\n\nInterpretless, almost, as his own thoughts―\n\nthe brilliant lights, the brilliant lights exist.\n\nIntruding faces ogle, gape, insist―\n\nthis madness, this soft-hissing breath, makes sense.\n\nWhy can he not float on, in dark suspense,\n\nand dream of life? Why did they rip him out?\n\nHe frowns at them―small gnomish frowns, all doubt―\n\nand with an ancient mien, O sorrowful!,\n\nre-closes eyes that saw in darkness null\n\necstatic sights, exceeding beautiful.\n\nArchaischer Torso Apollos (“Archaic Torso of Apollo”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe cannot know the beheaded god\n\nnor his eyes' forfeited visions. But still\n\nthe figure's trunk glows with the strange vitality\n\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\n\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\n\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\n\nnor the centering ***** make us smile\n\nat the thought of their generative animus.\n\nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\n\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\n\nprojecting procreation's triangular spearhead upwards,\n\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\n\nlike an inchoate star―demanding our belief.\n\nYou must change your life.\n\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE: This is a Rilke sonnet about a major resolution: changing the very nature of one's life. While it is only my personal interpretation of the poem above, I believe Rilke was saying to himself: \"I must change my life.\" Why? Perhaps because he wanted to be a real artist, and when confronted with real, dynamic, living and breathing art of Rodin, he realized that he had to inject similar vitality, energy and muscularity into his poetry. Michelangelo said that he saw the angel in a block of marble, then freed it. Perhaps Rilke had to find the dynamic image of Apollo, the God of Poetry, in his materials, which were paper, ink and his imagination.―Michael R. Burch\n\nKomm, Du (“Come, You”)\n\nby Ranier Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThis was Rilke’s last poem, written ten days before his death. He died open-eyed in the arms of his doctor on December 29, 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium, of leukemia and its complications. I had a friend who died of leukemia and he was burning up with fever in the end. I believe that is what Rilke was describing here: he was literally burning alive.\n\nCome, you―the last one I acknowledge; return―\n\nincurable pain searing this physical mesh.\n\nAs I burned in the spirit once, so now I burn\n\nwith you; meanwhile, you consume my flesh.\n\nThis wood that long resisted your embrace\n\nnow nourishes you; I surrender to your fury\n\nas my gentleness mutates to hellish rage―\n\nuncaged, wild, primal, mindless, outré.\n\nCompletely free, no longer future’s pawn,\n\nI clambered up this crazy pyre of pain,\n\ncertain I’d never return―my heart’s reserves gone―\n\nto become death’s nameless victim, purged by flame.\n\nNow all I ever was must be denied.\n\nI left my memories of my past elsewhere.\n\nThat life―my former life―remains outside.\n\nInside, I’m lost. Nobody knows me here.\n\nDer Panther (\"The Panther\")\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHis weary vision's so overwhelmed by iron bars,\n\nhis exhausted eyes see only blank Oblivion.\n\nHis world is not our world. It has no stars.\n\nNo light. Ten thousand bars. Nothing beyond.\n\nLithe, swinging with a rhythmic easy stride,\n\nhe circles, his small orbit tightening,\n\nan electron losing power. Paralyzed,\n\nsoon regal Will stands stunned, an abject thing.\n\nOnly at times the pupils' curtains rise\n\nsilently, and then an image enters,\n\ndescends through arrested shoulders, plunges, centers\n\nsomewhere within his empty heart, and dies.\n\nLiebes-Lied (“Love Song”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHow can I withhold my soul so that it doesn’t touch yours?\n\nHow can I lift mine gently to higher things, alone?\n\nOh, I would gladly find something lost in the dark\n\nin that inert space that fails to resonate until you vibrate.\n\nThere everything that moves us, draws us together like a bow\n\nenticing two taut strings to sing together with a simultaneous voice.\n\nWhose instrument are we becoming together?\n\nWhose, the hands that excite us?\n\nAh, sweet song!\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\n\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\n\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\n\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\n\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\n\nand in every virtue that is held most dear―\n\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\n\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\n\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\n\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently―\n\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\n\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\n\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\n\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again―\n\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\nEbb Tide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMassive, gray, these leaden waves\n\nbear their unchanging burden―\n\nthe sameness of each day to day\n\nwhile the wind seems to struggle to say\n\nsomething half-submerged planks at the mouth of the bay\n\nmight nuzzle limp seaweed to understand.\n\nNow collapsing dull waves drain away\n\nfrom the unenticing land;\n\nshrieking gulls shadow fish through salt spray―\n\nwhitish streaks on a fogged silver mirror.\n\nSizzling lightning impresses its brand.\n\nUnseen fingers scribble something in the wet sand.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Southwest Review.\n\nWater and Gold\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nYou came to me as rain breaks on the desert\n\nwhen every flower springs to life at once,\n\nbut joy's a wan illusion to the expert:\n\nthe Bedouin has learned how not to want.\n\nYou came to me as riches to a miser\n\nwhen all is gold, or so his heart believes,\n\nuntil he dies much thinner and much wiser,\n\nhis gleaming bones hauled off by chortling thieves.\n\nYou gave your heart too soon, too dear, too vastly;\n\nI could not take it in; it was too much.\n\nI pledged to meet your price, but promised rashly.\n\nI died of thirst, of your bright Midas touch.\n\nI dreamed you gave me water of your lips,\n\nthen sealed my tomb with golden hieroglyphs.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe City Is a Garment\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nA rhinestone skein, a jeweled brocade of light,―\n\nthe city is a garment stretched so thin\n\nher festive colors bleed into the night,\n\nand everywhere bright seams, unraveling,\n\ncascade their brilliant contents out like coins\n\non motorways and esplanades; bead cars\n\ncome tumbling down long highways; at her groin\n\na railtrack like a zipper flashes sparks;\n\nher hills are haired with brush like cashmere wool\n\nand from their cleavage winking lights enlarge\n\nand travel, slender fingers ... softly pull\n\nthemselves into the semblance of a barge.\n\nWhen night becomes too chill, she softly dons\n\ngreat overcoats of warmest-colored dawn.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe Folly of Wisdom\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nShe is wise in the way that children are wise,\n\nlooking at me with such knowing, grave eyes\n\nI must bend down to her to understand.\n\nBut she only smiles, and takes my hand.\n\nWe are walking somewhere that her feet know to go,\n\nso I smile, and I follow ...\n\nAnd the years are dark creatures concealed in bright leaves\n\nthat flutter above us, and what she believes―\n\nI can almost remember―goes something like this:\n\nthe prince is a horned toad, awaiting her kiss.\n\nShe wiggles and giggles, and all will be well\n\nif only we find him! The woodpecker’s knell\n\nas he hammers the coffin of some dying tree\n\nthat once was a fortress to someone like me\n\nrings wildly above us. Some things that we know\n\nwe are meant to forget. Life is a bloodletting, maple-syrup-slow.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Romantics Quarterly.\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant . . .\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n―feverish, wet―\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union . . .\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nThis is one of my early free verse sonnets but I can’t remember exactly when I wrote it. Due to the romantic style, I believe it was probably written during my first two years in college, making me 18 or 19 at the time.\n\nAbide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Philip Larkin's \"Aubade\"\n\nIt is hard to understand or accept mortality―\n\nsuch an alien concept: not to be.\n\nPerhaps unsettling enough to spawn religion,\n\nor to scare mutant fish out of a primordial sea\n\nboiling like goopy green tea in a kettle.\n\nPerhaps a man should exhibit more mettle\n\nthan to admit such fear, denying Nirvana exists\n\nsimply because we are stuck here in such a fine fettle.\n\nAnd so we abide . . .\n\neven in life, staring out across that dark brink.\n\nAnd if the thought of death makes your questioning heart sink,\n\nit is best not to drink\n\n(or, drinking, certainly not to think).\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Light Quarterly.\n\nFree Fall\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese cloudless nights, the sky becomes a wheel\n\nwhere suns revolve around an axle star ...\n\nLook there, and choose. Decide which moon is yours.\n\nSink Lethe-ward, held only by a heel.\n\nAdvantage. Disadvantage. Who can tell?\n\nTo see is not to know, but you can feel\n\nthe tug sometimes―the gravity, the shell\n\nas lustrous as damp pearl. You sink, you reel\n\ntoward some draining revelation. Air―\n\ntoo thin to grasp, to breath. Such pressure. Gasp.\n\nThe stars invert, electric, everywhere.\n\nAnd so we fall, down-tumbling through night’s fissure ...\n\ntwo beings pale, intent to fall forever\n\naround each other―fumbling at love’s tether ...\n\nnow separate, now distant, now together.\n\nThis is a 15-line free verse sonnet originally published by Sonnet Scroll.\n\nOnce\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nOnce when her kisses were fire incarnate\n\nand left in their imprint bright lipstick, and flame,\n\nwhen her breath rose and fell over smoldering dunes,\n\nleaving me listlessly sighing her name . . .\n\nOnce when her ******* were as pale, as beguiling,\n\nas wan rivers of sand shedding heat like a mist,\n\nwhen her words would at times softly, mildly rebuke me\n\nall the while as her lips did more wildly insist . . .\n\nOnce when the thought of her echoed and whispered\n\nthrough vast wastelands of need like a Bedouin chant,\n\nI ached for the touch of her lips with such longing\n\nthat I vowed all my former vows to recant . . .\n\nOnce, only once, something bloomed, of a desiccate seed―\n\nthis implausible blossom her wild rains of kisses decreed.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nAt Once\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nI have not come for the harvest of roses―\n\nthe poets' mad visions,\n\ntheir railing at rhyme ...\n\nfor I have discerned what their writing discloses:\n\nweak words wanting meaning,\n\nbeat torsioning time.\n\nNor have I come for the reaping of gossamer―\n\nimages weak,\n\ntoo forced not to fail;\n\ngathered by poets who worship their luster,\n\nthey shimmer, impendent,\n\nresplendently pale.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nDistances\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMoonbeams on water―\n\nthe reflected light\n\nof a halcyon star\n\nnow drowning in night ...\n\nSo your memories are.\n\nFootprints on beaches\n\nnow flooding with water;\n\nthe small, broken ribcage\n\nof some primitive slaughter ...\n\nSo near, yet so far.\n\nNOTE: In the first stanza the \"halcyon star\" is the sun, which has dropped below the horizon and is thus \"drowning in night.\" But its light strikes the moon, creating moonbeams which are reflected by the water. Sometimes memories seem that distant, that faint, that elusive. Footprints are being washed away, a heart is missing from its ribcage, and even things close at hand can seem infinitely beyond our reach.\n\nA Surfeit of Light\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was always a surfeit of light in your presence.\n\nYou stood distinctly apart, not of the humdrum world―\n\na chariot of gold in a procession of plywood.\n\nWe were all pioneers of the modern expedient race,\n\nraising the ante: Home Depot to Lowe’s.\n\nYours was an antique grace―Thrace’s or Mesopotamia’s.\n\nWe were never quite sure of your silver allure,\n\nof your trillium-and-platinum diadem,\n\nof your utter lack of flatware-like utility.\n\nYou told us that night―your wound would not scar.\n\nThe black moment passed, then you were no more.\n\nThe darker the sky, how much brighter the Star!\n\nThe day of your funeral, I ripped out the crown mold.\n\nYou were this fool’s gold.\n\nSongstress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Nadia Anjuman\n\nWithin its starkwhite ribcage, how the heart\n\nmust flutter wildly, O, and always sing\n\nagainst the pressing darkness: all it knows\n\nuntil at last it feels the numbing sting\n\nof death. Then life's brief vision swiftly passes,\n\nimposing night on one who clearly saw.\n\nDeath held your bright heart tightly, till its maw―\n\nenvenomed, fanged―could swallow, whole, your Awe.\n\nAnd yet it was not death so much as you\n\nwho sealed your doom; you could not help but sing\n\nand not be silenced. Here, behold your tomb's\n\nwhite alabaster cage: pale, wretched thing!\n\nBut you'll not be imprisoned here, wise wren!\n\nYour words soar free; rise, sing, fly, live again.\n\nA poet like Nadia Anjuman can be likened to a caged bird, deprived of flight, who somehow finds it within herself to sing of love and beauty. But when the world finally robs her of both flight and song, what is left for her but to leave the world, thus bereaving the world of herself and her song?\n\nCome Down\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Harold Bloom\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom your high mountain tower.\n\nHow coldly the wind blows,\n\nhow late this chill hour ...\n\nand I cannot wait\n\nfor a meteor shower\n\nto show you the time\n\nmust be now, or not ever.\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom the high mountain heather\n\nnow brittle and brown\n\nas fierce northern gales sever.\n\nCome down, or your heart\n\nwill grow cold as the weather\n\nwhen winter devours\n\nand spring returns never.\n\nNOTE: I dedicated this poem to Harold Bloom after reading his introduction to the Best American Poetry anthology he edited. Bloom seemed intent on claiming poetry as the province of the uber-reader (i.e., himself), but I remember reading poems by Blake, Burns, cummings, Dickinson, Frost, Housman, Eliot, Pound, Shakespeare, Whitman, Yeats, et al, and grokking them as a boy, without any “advanced” instruction from anyone.\n\nSuch Tenderness\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers of Gaza and loving, compassionate mothers everywhere\n\nThere was, in your touch, such tenderness―as\n\nonly the dove on her mildest day has,\n\nwhen she shelters downed fledglings beneath a warm wing\n\nand coos to them softly, unable to sing.\n\nWhat songs long forgotten occur to you now―\n\na babe at each breast? What terrible vow\n\nripped from your throat like the thunder that day\n\ncan never hold severing lightnings at bay?\n\nTime taught you tenderness―time, oh, and love.\n\nBut love in the end is seldom enough ...\n\nand time?―insufficient to life’s brief task.\n\nI can only admire, unable to ask―\n\nwhat is the source, whence comes the desire\n\nof a woman to love as no God may require?\n\nIn this Ordinary Swoon\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIn this ordinary swoon\n\nas I pass from life to death,\n\nI feel no heat from the cold, pale moon;\n\nI feel no sympathy for breath.\n\nWho I am and why I came,\n\nI do not know; nor does it matter.\n\nThe end of every man’s the same\n\nand every god’s as mad as a hatter.\n\nI do not fear the letting go;\n\nI only fear the clinging on\n\nto hope when there’s no hope, although\n\nI lift my face to the blazing sun\n\nand feel the greater intensity\n\nof the wilder inferno within me.\n\nThis is a mostly tetrameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMare Clausum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese are the narrows of my soul―\n\ndark waters pierced by eerie, haunting screams.\n\nAnd these uncharted islands bleakly home\n\nwild nightmares and deep, strange, forbidding dreams.\n\nPlease don’t think to find pearls’ pale, unearthly glow\n\nwithin its shoals, nor corals in its reefs.\n\nFor, though you seek to salvage Love, I know\n\nthat vessel lists, and night brings no relief.\n\nPause here, and look, and know that all is lost;\n\nthen turn, and go; let salt consume, and rust.\n\nThis sea is not for sailors, but the ******\n\nwho lingered long past morning, till they learned\n\nwhy it is named:\n\nMare Clausum.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet with shorter and longer lines, originally published by Penny Dreadful. Mare Clausum is Latin for \"Closed Sea.\" I wrote the first version of this poem as a teenager.\n\nRedolence\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow darkness ponds upon the violet hills;\n\ncicadas sing; the tall elms gently sway;\n\nand night bends near, a deepening shade of gray;\n\nthe bass concerto of a bullfrog fills\n\nwhat silence there once was; globed searchlights play.\n\nGreen hanging ferns adorn dark window sills,\n\nall drooping fronds, awaiting morning’s flares;\n\nmosquitoes whine; the lissome moth again\n\nflits like a veiled oud-dancer, and endures\n\nthe fumblings of night’s enervate gray rain.\n\nAnd now the pact of night is made complete;\n\nthe air is fresh and cool, washed of the grime\n\nof the city’s ashen breath; and, for a time,\n\nthe fragrance of her clings, obscure and sweet.\n\nPublished by The Eclectic Muse and The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nFountainhead\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI did not delight in love so much\n\nas in a kiss like linnets' wings,\n\nthe flutterings of a pulse so soft\n\nthe heart remembers, as it sings:\n\nto bathe there was its transport, brushed\n\nby marble lips, or porcelain,―\n\none liquid kiss, one cool outburst\n\nfrom pale rosettes. What did it mean ...\n\nto float awhirl on minute tides\n\nwithin the compass of your eyes,\n\nto feel your alabaster bust\n\ngrow cold within? Ecstatic sighs\n\nseem hisses now; your eyes, serene,\n\nreflect the sun's pale tourmaline.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\n\nPan\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n... Among the shadows of the groaning elms,\n\namid the darkening oaks, we fled ourselves ...\n\n... Once there were paths that led to coracles\n\nthat clung to piers like loosening barnacles ...\n\n... where we cannot return, because we lost\n\nthe pebbles and the playthings, and the moss ...\n\n... hangs weeping gently downward, maidens’ hair\n\nwho never were enchanted, and the stairs ...\n\n... that led up to the Fortress in the trees\n\nwill not support our weight, but on our knees ...\n\n... we still might fit inside those splendid hours\n\nof damsels in distress, of rustic towers ...\n\n... of voices of the wolves’ tormented howls\n\nthat died, and live in dreams’ soft, windy vowels ...\n\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\n\nThe Endeavors of Lips\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHow sweet the endeavors of lips: to speak\n\nof the heights of those pleasures which left us weak\n\nin love’s strangely lit beds, where the cold springs creak:\n\nfor there is no illusion like love ...\n\nGrown childlike, we wish for those storied days,\n\nfor those bright sprays of flowers, those primrosed ways\n\nthat curled to the towers of Yesterdays\n\nwhere She braided illusions of love ...\n\n\"O, let down your hair!\"―we might call and call,\n\nto the dark-slatted window, the moonlit wall ...\n\nbut our love is a shadow; we watch it crawl\n\nlike a spidery illusion. For love ...\n\nwas never as real as that first kiss seemed\n\nwhen we read by the flashlight and dreamed.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly (USA) and The Eclectic Muse (Canada)\n\nLoose Knit\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nShe blesses the needle,\n\nfetches fine red stitches,\n\ncriss-crossing, embroidering dreams\n\nin the delicate fabric.\n\nAnd if her hand jerks and twitches in puppet-like fits,\n\nshe tells herself\n\nreality is not as threadbare as it seems ...\n\nthat a little more darning may gather loose seams.\n\nShe weaves an unraveling tapestry\n\nof fatigue and remorse and pain; ...\n\nonly the nervously pecking needle\n\n****** her to motion, again and again.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet published by The Chariton Review as “The Knitter,” then by Penumbra, Black Bear Review and Triplopia.\n\nIf You Come to San Miguel\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf you come to San Miguel\n\nbefore the orchids fall,\n\nwe might stroll through lengthening shadows\n\nthose deserted streets\n\nwhere love first bloomed ...\n\nYou might buy the same cheap musk\n\nfrom that mud-spattered stall\n\nwhere with furtive eyes the vendor\n\nwatched his fragrant wares\n\nperfume your ******* ...\n\nWhere lean men mend tattered nets,\n\ndisgruntled sea gulls chide;\n\nwe might find that cafetucho\n\nwhere through grimy panes\n\nsunset implodes ...\n\nWhere tall cranes spin canvassed loads,\n\nthe strange anhingas glide.\n\nGreen brine laps splintered moorings,\n\nrusted iron chains grind,\n\nweighed and anchored in the past,\n\nheld fast by luminescent tides ...\n\nShould you come to San Miguel?\n\nLet love decide.\n\nA Vain Word\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nOleanders at dawn preen extravagant whorls\n\nas I read in leaves’ Sanskrit brief moments remaining\n\ntill sunset implodes, till the moon strands grey pearls\n\nunder moss-stubbled oaks, full of whispers, complaining\n\nto the minions of autumn, how swiftly life goes\n\nas I fled before love ... Now, through leaves trodden black,\n\nshivering, I wander as winter’s first throes\n\nof cool listless snow drench my cheeks, back and neck.\n\nI discerned in one season all eternities of grief,\n\nthe specter of death sprawled out under the rose,\n\nthe last consequence of faith in the flight of one leaf,\n\nthe incontinence of age, as life’s bright torrent slows.\n\nO, where are you now?―I was timid, absurd.\n\nI would find comfort again in a vain word.\n\nPublished by Chrysanthemum and Tucumcari Literary Review\n\nChloe\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere were skies onyx at night ... moons by day ...\n\nlakes pale as her eyes ... breathless winds\n\n******* tall elms; ... she would say\n\nthat we loved, but I figured we’d sinned.\n\nSoon impatiens too fiery to stay\n\nsagged; the crocus bells drooped, golden-limned;\n\nthings of brightness, rinsed out, ran to gray ...\n\nall the light of that world softly dimmed.\n\nWhere our feet were inclined, we would stray;\n\nthere were paths where dead weeds stood untrimmed,\n\ndistant mountains that loomed in our way,\n\nthunder booming down valleys dark-hymned.\n\nWhat I found, I found lost in her face\n\nwhile yielding all my virtue to her grace.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly as “A Dying Fall”\n\nAflutter\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThis rainbow is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh.―Yahweh\n\nYou are gentle now, and in your failing hour\n\nhow like the child you were, you seem again,\n\nand smile as sadly as the girl (age ten?)\n\nwho held the sparrow with the mangled wing\n\nclose to her heart. It marveled at your power\n\nbut would not mend. And so the world renews\n\nold vows it seemed to make: false promises\n\nspring whispers, as if nothing perishes\n\nthat does not resurrect to wilder hues\n\nlike rainbows’ eerie pacts we apprehend\n\nbut cannot fail to keep. Now in your eyes\n\nI see the end of life that only dies\n\nand does not care for bright, translucent lies.\n\nAre tears so precious? These few, let us spend\n\ntogether, as before, then lay to rest\n\nthese sparrows’ hearts aflutter at each breast.\n\nThis is a poem about a couple committing suicide together. The “eerie pact” refers to a Bible verse about the rainbow being a “covenant,” when the only covenant human beings can depend on is the original one that condemned us to suffer and die. That covenant is always kept perfectly.\n\nTo Flower\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen Pentheus [\"grief'] went into the mountains in the garb of the baccae, his mother [Agave] and the other maenads, possessed by Dionysus, tore him apart (Euripides, Bacchae; Apollodorus 3.5.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.511-733; Hyginus, Fabulae 184). The agave dies as soon as it blooms; the moonflower, or night-blooming cereus, is a desert plant of similar fate.\n\nWe are not long for this earth, I know―\n\nyou and I, all our petals incurled,\n\ntill a night of pale brilliance, moonflower aglow.\n\nIs there love anywhere in this strange world?\n\nThe Agave knows best when it's time to die\n\nand rages to life with such rapturous leaves\n\nher name means Illustrious. Each hour more high,\n\nshe claws toward heaven, for, if she believes\n\nin love at all, she has left it behind\n\nto flower, to flower. When darkness falls\n\nshe wilts down to meet it, where something crawls:\n\nbeheaded, bewildered. And since love is blind,\n\nshe never adored it, nor watches it go.\n\nCan we be as she is, moonflower aglow?\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nFlight 93\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI held the switch in trembling fingers, asked\n\nwhy existence felt so small, so purposeless,\n\nlike a minnow wriggling feebly in my grasp ...\n\nvibrations of huge engines thrummed my arms\n\nas, glistening with sweat, I nudged the switch\n\nto OFF ... I heard the klaxon-shrill alarms\n\nlike vultures’ shriekings ... earthward, in a stall ...\n\nwe floated ... earthward ... wings outstretched, aghast\n\nlike Icarus ... as through the void we fell ...\n\ntill nothing was so beautiful, so blue ...\n\nso vivid as that moment ... and I held\n\nan image of your face, and dreamed I flew\n\ninto your arms. The earth rushed up. I knew\n\nsuch comfort, in that moment, loving you.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The Lyric.\n\nOasis\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI want tears to form again\n\nin the shriveled glands of these eyes\n\ndried all these long years\n\nby too much heated knowing.\n\nI want tears to course down\n\nthese parched cheeks,\n\nto star these cracked lips\n\nlike an improbable dew\n\nin the heart of a desert.\n\nI want words to burble up\n\nlike happiness, like the thought of love,\n\nlike the overwhelming, shimmering thought of you\n\nto a nomad who\n\nhas only known drought.\n\nThis is a mostly hexameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMelting\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nEntirely, as spring consumes the snow,\n\nthe thought of you consumes me: I am found\n\nin rivulets, dissolved to what I know\n\nof former winters’ passions. Underground,\n\nperhaps one slender icicle remains\n\nof what I was before, in some dark cave―\n\na stalactite, long calcified, now drains\n\nto sodden pools, whose milky liquid laves\n\nthe colder rock, thus washing something clean\n\nthat never saw the light, that never knew\n\nthe crust could break above, that light could stream:\n\nso luminous, so bright, so beautiful ...\n\nI lie revealed, and so I stand transformed,\n\nand all because you smiled on me, and warmed.\n\nAfterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe night is full of stars. Which still exist?\n\nBefore time ends, perhaps one day we’ll know.\n\nFor now I hold your fingers to my lips\n\nand feel their pulse ... warm, palpable and slow ...\n\nonce slow to match this reckless spark in me,\n\nthis moon in ceaseless orbit I became,\n\ncompelled by wilder gravity to flee\n\nnight’s universe of suns, for one pale flame ...\n\nfor one pale flame that seemed to signify\n\nthe Zodiac of all, the meaning of\n\nlove’s wandering flight past Neptune. Now to lie\n\nin dawning recognition is enough ...\n\nenough each night to bask in you, to know\n\nthe face of love ... eyes closed ... its afterglow.\n\nAll Afterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSomething remarkable, perhaps ...\n\nthe color of her eyes ... though I forget\n\nthe color of her eyes ... perhaps her hair\n\nthe way it blew about ... I do not know\n\njust what it was about her that has kept\n\nher thought lodged deep in mine ... unmelted snow\n\nthat lasted till July would be less rare,\n\nclasped in some frozen cavern where the wind\n\nsculpts bright grotesqueries, ignoring springs’\n\nand summers’ higher laws ... there thawing slow\n\nand strange by strange degrees, one tick beyond\n\nthe freezing point which keeps all things the same\n\n... till what remains is fragile and unlike\n\nthe world above, where melted snows and rains\n\nform rivulets that, inundate with sun,\n\nevaporate, and in life’s cyclic stream\n\nremake the world again ... I do not know\n\nthat we can be remade―all afterglow.\n\nThese Hallowed Halls\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na young Romantic Poet mourns the passing of an age . . .\n\nA final stereo fades into silence\n\nand now there is seldom a murmur\n\nto trouble the slumber of these ancient halls.\n\nI stand by a window where others have watched\n\nthe passage of time alone, not untouched,\n\nand I am as they were―unsure, for the days\n\nstretch out ahead, a bewildering maze.\n\nAh, faithless lover―that I had never touched your breast,\n\nnor felt the stirrings of my heart,\n\nwhich until that moment had peacefully slept.\n\nFor now I have known the exhilaration\n\nof a heart that has leapt every pinnacle of Love,\n\nand the result of all such infatuations―\n\nthe long freefall to earth, as the moon glides above.\n\nCome!\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWill you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder,\n\nwhen I have lain so long in the indifferent earth\n\nthat I have no girth?\n\nWhen my womb has conformed to the chastity\n\nyour anemic Messiah envisioned for me,\n\nwill you finally be pleased that my *** was thus rendered\n\nunpalatable, disengendered?\n\nAnd when those strange loathsome organs that troubled you so\n\nhave been eaten by worms, will the heavens still glow\n\nwith the approval of God that I ended a maid―\n\nthanks to a *****?\n\nAnd will you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder?\n\nErin\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is her hair―\n\nbright carrot―and her milkmaid-pallid skin,\n\nher brilliant air of cavalier despair,\n\nher train of children―some conceived in sin,\n\nthe others to avoid it. For nowhere\n\nis evidence of thought. Devout, pale, thin,\n\ngay, nonchalant, all radiance. So fair!\n\nHow can men look upon her and not spin\n\nlike wobbly buoys churned by her skirt’s brisk air?\n\nThey buy. They ***** to pat her nyloned shin,\n\nto share her elevated, pale Despair ...\n\nto find at last two spirits ease no one’s.\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is the Care,\n\nher impish grin, green eyes like leprechauns’.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“I made it out of a mouthful of air.”―W. B. Yeats\n\nWe breathe and so we write; the night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn; the page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean we write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight, each plosive’s shape―\n\ncurved like the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass beneath bright glass\n\nlike singing voles curled in a maze\n\nof blank white space. We touch a face―\n\nlong-frozen words trapped in a glaze\n\nthat insulates our hearts. Nowhere\n\ncan love be found. Just shrieking air.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWe breathe and so we write;\n\nthe night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn;\n\nthe page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean\n\nwe write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight,\n\nthe blood’s debate\n\nwithin the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass\n\nagainst bright glass,\n\nwithin the white Labyrinthian maze.\n\nThrough simple grace,\n\nI touch your face,\n\nah words! And I would gaze\n\nthe night’s dark length\n\nin waning strength\n\nto find the words to feel\n\nsuch light again.\n\nO, for a pen\n\nto spell love so ethereal.\n\nTo Please The Poet\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nTo please the poet, words must dance―\n\nstaccato, brisk, a two-step:\n\nso!\n\nOr waltz in elegance to time\n\nof music mild,\n\nadagio.\n\nTo please the poet, words must chance\n\nemotion in catharsis―\n\nflame.\n\nOr splash into salt seas, descend\n\nin sheets of silver-shining\n\nrain.\n\nTo please the poet, words must prance\n\nand gallop, gambol, revel,\n\nrail.\n\nOr muse upon a moment, mute,\n\nobscure, unsure, imperfect,\n\npale.\n\nTo please the poet, words must sing,\n\nor croak, wart-tongued, imagining.\n\nThe First Christmas\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n’Twas in a land so long ago . . .\n\nthe lambs lay blanketed in snow\n\nand little children everywhere\n\nsat and watched warm embers glow\n\nand dreamed (of what, we do not know).\n\nAnd THEN―a star appeared on high,\n\nThe brightest man had ever seen!\n\nIt made the children whisper low\n\nin puzzled awe (what did it mean?).\n\nIt made the wooly lambkins cry.\n\nFor far away a new-born lay,\n\nwarm-blanketed in straw and hay,\n\na lowly manger for his crib.\n\nThe cattle mooed, distraught and low,\n\nto see the child. They did not know\n\nit now was Christmas day!\n\nThis is a poem in which I tried to capture the mystery and magic of the first Christmas day. If you like my poem, you are welcome to share it, but please cite me as the author, which you can do by including the title and subheading.\n\nThe Lingering and the Unconsoled Heart\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere is a silence―\n\nthe last unspoken moment\n\nbefore death,\n\nwhen the moon,\n\ncratered and broken,\n\nis all madness and light,\n\nwhen the breath comes low and complaining,\n\nand the heart is a ruin\n\nof emptiness and night.\n\nThere is a grief―\n\nthe grief of a lover's embrace\n\nwhile faith still shimmers in a mother’s tears ...\n\nThere is no emptier time, nor place,\n\nwhile the faint glimmer of life is ours\n\nthat the lingering and the unconsoled heart fears\n\nbeyond this: seeing its own stricken face\n\nin eyes that drift toward some incomprehensible place.\n\nLozenge\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen I was closest to love, it did not seem\n\nreal at all, but a thing of such tenuous sweetness\n\nit might dissolve in my mouth\n\nlike a lozenge of sugar.\n\nWhen I held you in my arms, I did not feel\n\nour lack of completeness,\n\nknowing how easy it was\n\nfor us to cling to each other.\n\nAnd there were nights when the clouds\n\nsped across the moon’s face,\n\nexposing such rarified brightness\n\nwe did not witness\n\nso much as embrace\n\nlove’s human appearance.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The HyperTexts.\n\nThe Princess and the Pauper\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Norman Kraeft in memory of his beloved wife June Kysilko Kraeft\n\nHere was a woman bright, intent on life,\n\nwho did not flinch from Death, but caught his eye\n\nand drew him, powerless, into her spell\n\nof wanting her himself, so much the lie\n\nthat she was meant for him―obscene illusion!―\n\nmade him seem a monarch throned like God on high,\n\nwhen he was less than nothing; when to die\n\nmeant many stultifying, pained embraces.\n\nShe shed her gown, undid the tangled laces\n\nthat tied her to the earth: then she was his.\n\nNow all her erstwhile beauty he defaces\n\nand yet she grows in hallowed loveliness―\n\nher ghost beyond perfection―for to die\n\nwas to ascend. Now he begs, penniless.\n\nAlbum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI caress them―trapped in brittle cellophane―\n\nand I see how young they were, and how unwise;\n\nand I remember their first flight―an old prop plane,\n\ntheir blissful arc through alien blue skies ...\n\nAnd I touch them here through leaves which―tattered, frayed―\n\nare also wings, but wings that never flew:\n\nlike insects’ wings―pinned, held. Here, time delayed,\n\ntheir features never changed, remaining two ...\n\nAnd Grief, which lurked unseen beyond the lens\n\nor in shadows where It crept on feral claws\n\nas It scratched Its way into their hearts, depends\n\non sorrows such as theirs, and works Its jaws ...\n\nand slavers for Its meat―those young, unwise,\n\nwho naively dare to dream, yet fail to see\n\nhow, lumbering sunward, Hope, ungainly, flies,\n\nclutching to Her ruffled breast what must not be.\n\nBecause You Came to Me\n\nby Michael R.

Yeats\n\nThey laugh and do not comprehend, nor ask\n\nwhich way the wind is blowing, no, nor why\n\nthe reeling azure fixture of the sky\n\ngrows pale with ash, and whispers “Holocaust.”\n\nThey think to seize the ring, life’s tinfoil prize,\n\nand, breathless with endeavor, shriek aloud.\n\nThe voice of terror thunders from a cloud\n\nthat darkens over children adult-wise,\n\nfar less inclined to error, when a step\n\nin any wrong direction is to fall\n\na JDAM short of heaven. Decoys call,\n\ntheir voices plangent, honking to be shot . . .\n\nHere, childish dreams and nightmares whirl, collide,\n\nas East and West, on slouching beasts, they ride.\n\nAt Cædmon’s Grave\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“Cædmon’s Hymn,” composed at the Monastery of Whitby (a North Yorkshire fishing village), is one of the oldest known poems written in the English language, dating back to around 680 A.D. According to legend, Cædmon, an illiterate Anglo-Saxon cowherd, received the gift of poetic composition from an angel; he subsequently founded a school of Christian poets. Unfortunately, only nine lines of Cædmon’s verse survive, in the writings of the Venerable Bede. Whitby, tiny as it is, reappears later in the history of English literature, having been visited, in diametric contrast, by Lewis Carroll and Bram Stoker’s ghoulish yet evocative Dracula.\n\nAt the monastery of Whitby,\n\non a day when the sun sank through the sea,\n\nand the gulls shrieked wildly, jubilant, free,\n\nwhile the wind and time blew all around,\n\nI paced those dusk-enamored grounds\n\nand thought I heard the steps resound\n\nof Carroll, Stoker and good Bede\n\nwho walked there, too, their spirits freed\n\n―perhaps by God, perhaps by need―\n\nto write, and with each line, remember\n\nthe glorious light of Cædmon’s ember,\n\nscorched tongues of flame words still engender.\n\nHere, as darkness falls, at last we meet.\n\nI lay this pale garland of words at his feet.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nRadiance\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nThe poet delves earth’s detritus―hard toil―\n\nfor raw-edged nouns, barbed verbs, vowels’ lush bouquet;\n\neach syllable his pen excretes―dense soil,\n\ndark images impacted, rooted clay.\n\nThe poet sees the sea but feels its meaning―\n\nthe teeming brine, the mirrored oval flame\n\nthat leashes and excites its turgid surface ...\n\nthen squanders years imagining love’s the same.\n\nBelatedly he turns to what lies broken―\n\nthe scarred and furrowed plot he fiercely sifts,\n\namong death’s sicksweet dungs and composts seeking\n\none element that scorches and uplifts.\n\nDowndraft\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nWe feel rather than understand what he meant\n\nas he reveals a shattered firmament\n\nwhich before him never existed.\n\nHere, there are no images gnarled and twisted\n\nout of too many words,\n\nbut only flocks of white birds\n\nwheeling and flying.\n\nHere, as Time spins, reeling and dying,\n\nthe voice of a last gull\n\nor perhaps some spirit no longer whole,\n\nechoes its lonely madrigal\n\nand we feel its strange pull\n\non the astonished soul.\n\nO My Prodigal!\n\nThe vents of the sky, ripped asunder,\n\necho this wild, primal thunder—\n\nnow dying into undulations of vanishing wings . . .\n\nand this voice which in haggard bleak rapture still somehow downward sings.\n\nHuntress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Baudelaire\n\nLynx-eyed, cat-like and cruel, you creep\n\nacross a crevice dropping deep\n\ninto a dark and doomed domain.\n\nYour claws are sheathed. You smile, insane.\n\nRain falls upon your path, and pain\n\npours down. Your paws are pierced. You pause\n\nand heed the oft-lamented laws\n\nwhich bid you not begin again\n\ntill night returns. You wail like wind,\n\nthe sighing of a soul for sin,\n\nand give up hunting for a heart.\n\nTill sunset falls again, depart,\n\nthough hate and hunger urge you―\"On!\"\n\nHeed, hearts, your hope―the break of dawn.\n\nPublished by The HyperTexts, Dracula and His Kin and Sonnetto Poesia (Canada)\n\nHappily Never After (the Second Curse of the ***** Toad)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHe did not think of love of Her at all\n\nfrog-plangent nights, as moons engoldened roads\n\nthrough crumbling stonewalled provinces, where toads\n\n(nee princes) ruled in chinks and grew so small\n\nat last to be invisible. He smiled\n\n(the fables erred so curiously), and thought\n\nbemusedly of being reconciled\n\nto human flesh, because his heart was not\n\nincapable of love, but, being cursed\n\na second time, could only love a toad’s . . .\n\nand listened as inflated frogs rehearsed\n\ncheekbulging tales of anguish from green moats . . .\n\nand thought of her soft croak, her skin fine-warted,\n\nhis anemic flesh, and how true love was thwarted.\n\nBecause She Craved the Very Best\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBecause she craved the very best,\n\nhe took her East, he took her West;\n\nhe took her where there were no wars\n\nand brought her bright bouquets of stars,\n\nthe blush and fragrances of roses,\n\nthe hush an evening sky imposes,\n\nmoonbeams pale and garlands rare,\n\nand golden combs to match her hair,\n\na nightingale to sing all night,\n\nwhite wings, to let her soul take flight ...\n\nShe stabbed him with a poisoned sting\n\nand as he lay there dying,\n\nshe screamed, \"I wanted everything!\"\n\nand started crying.\n\nCaveat\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf only we were not so eloquent,\n\nwe might sing, and only sing, not to impress,\n\nbut only to enjoy, to be enjoyed.\n\nWe might inundate the earth with thankfulness\n\nfor light, although it dies, and make a song\n\nof night descending on the earth like bliss,\n\nwith other lights beyond―not to be known―\n\nbut only to be welcomed and enjoyed,\n\nbefore all worlds and stars are overthrown ...\n\nas a lover’s hands embrace a sleeping face\n\nand find it beautiful for emptiness\n\nof all but joy. There is no thought to love\n\nbut love itself. How senseless to redress,\n\nin darkness, such becoming nakedness . . .\n\nOriginally published by Clementine Unbound\n\nTo the Post-Modern Muse, Floundering\n\nby Michael R.

Magnified, the lens\n\nshot back absurd reflections of each face―\n\na carnival-like mirror. In the space\n\nbetween the silver backing and the glass,\n\nwe caught a glimpse of Joan, a frumpy lass\n\nwho never brushed her hair or teeth, and failed\n\nto pass on GO, and frequently was jailed\n\nfor awe’s beliefs. Like Alice, she grew wee\n\nto fit the door, then couldn’t lift the key.\n\nWe failed the test, and so the jury’s hung.\n\nIn Oz, “The Witch is Dead” ranks number one.\n\nDay, and Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe moon exposes pockmarked scars of craters;\n\nher visage, veiled by willows, palely looms.\n\nAnd we who rise each day to grind a living,\n\ndream each scented night of such perfumes\n\nas drew us to the window, to the moonlight,\n\nwhen all the earth was steeped in cobalt blue―\n\nan eerie vase of achromatic flowers\n\nbled silver by pale starlight, losing hue.\n\nThe night begins her waltz to waiting sunrise―\n\nadagio, the music she now hears;\n\nand we who in the sunlight slave for succor,\n\ndreaming, seek communion with the spheres.\n\nAnd all around the night is in crescendo,\n\nand everywhere the stars’ bright legions form,\n\nand here we hear the sweet incriminations\n\nof lovers we had once to keep us warm.\n\nAnd also here we find, like bled carnations,\n\nred lips that whitened, kisses drawn to lies,\n\nthat touched us once with fierce incantations\n\nand taught us love was prettier than wise.\n\n130 Refuted\n\nby Michael R.

Part by part,\n\nthe human smile becomes mock porcelain.\n\nTill in the end, the smile alone remains:\n\ntitanium-based alloys undestroyed\n\nwith graves’ worm-eaten contents, all the pains\n\nof bridgework unrecalled, and what annoyed\n\nus most about the corpses rectified\n\nto quaintest dust. The Smile winks, deified.\n\nModern Appetite\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIt grumbled low, insisting it would feast\n\non blood and flesh, etcetera, at least\n\nthree times a day. With soft lubricious grease\n\nand pale salacious oils, it would ease\n\nits way through life. Each day―an aperitif.\n\nEach night―a frothy bromide, for relief.\n\nIt lived on TV fare, wore pinafores,\n\nslurped sugar-coated gumballs, gobbled S’mores.\n\nWhen gas ensued, it burped and farted. ’Course,\n\nit thought aloud, my wife will leave me. ******\n\nare not so **** particular.

And her name?\n\n\"Mother of Cowards!\" From her enervate hand\n\nSoft ash descends. Her furtive eyes demand\n\nAllegiance to her ****'s repulsive game.\n\n\"Keep, ancient lands, your wretched poor!\" cries she\n\nWith scarlet lips. \"Give me your hale, your whole,\n\nYour huddled tycoons, yearning to be pleased!\n\nThe wretched refuse of your toilet hole?\n\nOh, never send one unwashed child to me!\n\nI await Trump's pleasure by the gilded bowl!\"\n\nOriginally published by Light\n\nPremonition\n\nby Michael R.

This would have been after my sophomore year in college, making me around 20 years old. The poem is “true” except that I was not the host because the party was at the house of one of the upper-level managers.
