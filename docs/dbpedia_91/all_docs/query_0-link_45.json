        "text": "2 GROUNDCOVER NEWS GROUNDCOVER from the DIRECTOR'S DESK customer, that the vendor has been LINDSAY CALKA Managing director Did you know that the Vendor Code of Conduct is printed in every paper? (Check out page 9, beneath the puzzles.) Every Groundcover News vendor agrees to this Code of Conduct on their first day; it is a list of our rules, a reflection of our culture and also a framework of how to sell the paper successfully while upholding the reputation of the organization. One very important element of the Code is: I will wear and display my badge while selling the paper. The badge is the only uniform piece that we require vendors to wear. The badge signals to you, the through the New Vendor Orientation, has purchased their papers from the office, and is accountable to the other vendors and the organization. Perhaps most importantly, the badge contains a solicitation permit for the municipalities they sell in — a permit that makes the act of selling Groundcover legal. The sentence “Please only buy from badged vendors” is printed on the cover of every Groundcover newspaper and magazine. Recently we have had a handful of people who are not, or are no longer, affiliated with Groundcover News incessantly try to sell the newspaper. We stamp the newspapers with Vendor Numbers to ensure Venmo sales go to vendors, and to track where papers are moving once they leave the office. Consequently, this call to customers has become ever more important: Please only buy from badged vendors, and check whether the number stamped on the paper matches the badge. If not, you might not be buying from a Groundcover vendor. Please contact the office if this happens. PROVIDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELFDETERMINED INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY POVERTY, PRODUCING A STREET NEWSPAPER THAT GIVES A PLATFORM TO UNDERREPRESENTED VOICES IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, PROMOTING AN ACTION TO BUILD A JUST, CARING AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY. Groundcover News, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded in April 2010 as a means to empower lowincome persons to make the transitions from homeless to housed, and from jobless to employed. Vendors purchase each copy of our regular editions of Groundcover News at our office for 50 cents. This money goes toward production costs.

I am a father, coach, pipefitter, as well as a great guy. Where do you usually sell Groundcover? All over — but you can catch me on Ashley and Liberty. When and why did you start selling Groundcover? Earlier this year. I was broke. What is your favorite thing to do in Ann Arbor? Shoot pool. What words do you live by? Never forget what a person does for you or what a person does to you. What is something about you that someone on the street wouldn't know? I'm a hopeless romantic. What motivates you to work hard selling Groundcover? My brother James Woods. What is something you wish you knew more about? The stock market. Arbor Art Fair (July 18-20, 2024) was very exciting and much anticipated. Art is loved in this town and mural art has been exploited over the past five years. One cannot drive anywhere in Ann Arbor without seeing large art installations on buildings and underpasses. There are new flowers painted on the bridge and underpass near Delonis Center and on the nearby railroad bridge on Miller Ave. This was finished during the Art Fair this year. (See “The Art of Gentrification” in the July 12 Groundcover News.) This year, walking along the downtown Main Street Art Fair I saw many different kinds of art — two-dimensional, three-dimensional, personal favorite has always been animals from an artist named Mr. Faun who is always in the same location. He does wonderful images of so many different animals as well as flowers, including my faves: pandas, dragons and roses. As I walked up Liberty Street I saw so much color this year, from abstract paintings to colored blown glass and the vibrant illustrations of fantasy scenes. I was awestruck with the details in much of the work this year. Hours upon hours of love goes into some of the work and the price doesn't do it justice. What I find hard for artists is the level at which art is graded by price. jewelry and more. My As I walked down to William CINDY GERE Groundcover vendor No. 279 What I feel is cheap art is by far priced out of a common person’s reach, and yet what is considered cheap art is so wonderful to look at and needs to be in a higher price range. The argument has always been over what art is truly worth and so artists struggle with this forever. Almost to the end of Liberty Street, I came upon the political and nonprofit organization section for social justice issues, religions and electoral politics. What I chose to get was the free candy they give out, fun fun yum yum! I walked up to State Street and turned right; this is where I found the African American art bead vendor. He remembered me from last year and so I got some wonderful beads. As a Native American, it's hard to come by beads now without paying a huge amount. Each vendor on State Street is fun to see, from discounted clothes to wonderful food. Street, I chose to look at the different precious gems and metal workers who create totally custom-made art — one of a kind. Every jeweler was unique: some were totally modern while others had a time period attached to them, such as the 1800s. I wandered up past the University of Michigan Law School and this one artist stuck out like no other. She was a Fimo artist (Fimo is a type of clay) with very vibrant colors, and being a colorist myself, I fell in love. She had just about everything someone could want, from magnets to pins and freestanding caricatures to sculptures that looked like they were right out of a Jim Henson Muppet movie — she had it all! This was for me the ultimate fun this year. Each artist touched me with their artwork and as I wandered down a lonely path on a side street, I found the hat that has eluded me for years. This vendor artist had wonderful vibrant colorful hats for sale. I chose to get a black one as others looked like Indiana Jones was ready to show up. It was fun to see the large variety of hats at this booth. My Art Fair was full of fun and colors and new ideas. I hope you had as much fun as I did this year. 2025 Art Fair here we come … 3 Dave Bing NBA Hall of Famer David (Dave) Bing played nine seasons for the Detroit Pistons, two seasons with the Washington Bullets and one season with the HOSEA HILL Groundcover vendor No. 532 (the inventor of basketball). “Everything that I’ve ever done, I Boston Celtics.

The story, narrated by reporter Martha Teichner, was titled “Inside Houston’s Successful Strategy to Reduce Homelessness.” Kelly Young, President of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston–Harris County, said that the Housing First model which was implemented in Houston should be followed by other cities in the nation. She noted, “We were one of the worst in the nation to begin with, in 2011, 2012. Since then, homelessness is down 63% in the greater Houston area, and more than 30,000 people have been housed.” Teichner talked to many of the organizers and beneficiaries of Houston’s Housing First Program. How did they do it? Instead of having dozens of homeless advocacy groups work separately on the services or programs they provide to the homeless, the community chose to create an umbrella organization known as The Way Home. This new organization is collaborative and is now called The Coalition for the Homeless of Houston–Harris County. The coalition agreed to have one president and CEO, Kelly Young; one Project Communication and Strategy Director, Mandy Chapman; Mayor’s Special Assistant Marc Eichenbaum and a dedicated board. What is Housing First? Like the Y Foundation Housing First of metropolitan Helsinki, Finland, Houston’s The Way Home Umbrella totally embraced the concepts and applications of Housing First. The National Alliance to End Homelessness provided a clear concept and definition of Housing First in a publication dated March 20, 2022: “Housing First is a homeless assistance approach that prioritizes providing permanent housing to people experiencing homelessness, thus ending their homelessness and serving as a platform from which they can pursue personal goals and improve their quality of life. “This approach is guided by the belief that people need basic necessities like food and a place to live before attending to anything less critical, such as getting a job, budgeting properly, or tackling substance use issues. Additionally, Housing First is based on the understanding that client choice is valuable in housing selection and supportive service participation, and that exercising that choice is likely to make a client more successful in remaining housed and improving their life.” The publication observes the differences between Housing First and other approaches. It states, “Housing AUGUST 9, 2024 Houston has success with \"Housing First\" strategy WILL SHAKESPEARE Groundcover vendor No. 258 First does not require people experiencing homelessness to address … all of their problems including behavioral health problems, or to graduate through a series of services programs before they can access housing. Housing First does not mandate participation in services either before obtaining housing or in order to retain housing. The Housing First approach views housing as the foundation for life improvement and enables access to permanent housing.” The Housing First concept discussed above is a generic concept definition. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development department’s report titled “Housing First in Permanent Supportive Housing” attempted to provide a more concise definition of Housing First. HUD stated, “Housing First is an approach to quickly and successfully connect individuals and families experiencing homelessness to permanent housing without preconditions and barriers to entry, such as sobriety, treatment or service participation requirements. Supportive services are offered to maximize housing stability and prevent returns to homelessness as opposed to addressing treatment goals prior to permanent housing entry.” On July 14, 2022, writer Robert Davis of the online magazine “Invisible People” stated that Housing First was first pioneered in the U.S. in the 1990s. It was developed by a professor named Dr. Sam Tsemberis. Housing First is premised on the principles — (a) Homelessness is first and foremost a housing crisis and can be addressed through the provision of safe and affordable housing; (b) All people experiencing homelessness, regardless of their housing history and duration of homelessness, can achieve housing stability in permanent housing. Some may need very little support for a brief period of time, while others may need more intensive and longterm supports; Everyone is “housing ready.” Sobriety, compliance in treatment, or even non-criminal histories are not necessary to succeed in housing. Rather, homelessness programs and housing providers must be More than 100 nonprofit, grassroots and government organizations are assembled under The Way Home Umbrella. “consumer ready;” (c) Many people experience improvement in quality of life in the areas of health, mental health, substance use and employment as a result of obtaining housing; (d) People experiencing homelessness have the right to self-determination and should be treated with dignity and respect; (e) The exact configuration of housing and services depends upon the needs and preferences of the population. Houston’s Housing First Implementation Strategy As noted in the introductory paragraphs, Houston was able to convince service and treatment providers, nonprofit philanthropy groups, and other homeless advocacy centers in the community, to join a coalition known as the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County. Houston’s next strategic move was to go all in by adopting the key concepts and principles of Housing First. Teichner of CBS Morning News talked to the newly housed individuals and families. She talked to outreach coordinators at some homeless encampments who use tracking devices to locate individuals with various needs, including permanent housing. She also talked to Young and the Housing First “architect” for The Way Home community umbrella, Mandy Chapman. Teichner noted that Chapman “now advises other cities on how to replicate it, among them Dallas, New Orleans and Oklahoma City.” In her conversation with Teichner, Chapman observed, “Our natural instinct when we see homelessness increasing is to hire more outreach workers and to build more shelters, beds … The idea that if you have no permanent place to live, that you are also going to be able to transform and tackle complex mental health issues, addiction issues, complex financial issues? It’s just unrealistic.” Impacts and Lessons for Cities Community impacts of Houston-Harris County’s Housing First implementation are quite impressive: • 32,000 homeless people permanently housed since 2012 by the partners of The Way Home • 90% success rate for local housing programs. (People don’t return homelessness within two years.) • 22,300 unique people who accessed homeless assistance in 2022. • $179 million in public funding in 2023. • $50 million in HUD’s Continuum of Care awarded to partners of The Way Home in 2023. • Net-zero veteran homelessness in Harris County-Houston metro area. • Over $1.4 million awarded to The Way Home in 2024 for homeless youth. On February 15, 2024, Groundcover News published an article titled, “Homelessness is a national crisis in America: lessons from Finland’s ‘Housing First’ policies.” Finland native Alexandra Granberg shared her knowledge of Finland/Helinski’s Housing First model with our local readers. Many other cities have tried to see HOUSTON page 11  CBS Sunday Morning also reported that “Houston has dismantled 127 homeless encampments, but only after housing had been found for all the occupants. So far this year, The Way Home has already housed more than 750 people. It helps that the city, unlike many, has a supply of relatively affordable apartments, and that it was able to use roughly $100 million in COVID aid to help pay for rentals on top of its other homeless relief dollars. But Houston’s message is this: What’s really essential to success is committing to homes, not just managing homelessness.” AUGUST 9, 2024 HOUSING Section 86’d: Housing Choice Voucher waitlist closes in Michigan Last month, the waiting list for Section 8 housing vouchers closed statewide. No new applications will be taken and existing renewals will not happen. The waiting list will be dropped entirely. This leaves some people who have been anxiously waiting for their spot for years feeling frustrated. The multi-year process of checking-in, preparing paperwork, meeting case managers can be a daunting effort. Two friends of mine are going through the process, Steve and Amy. They’re navigating the challenging terrain of the Michigan State Housing Development Authority’s (MSHDA) Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, commonly known as Section 8. This program is essential for providing affordable housing to low-income residents, but the process can be fraught with difficulties, especially with the complexities of the waiting list in Washtenaw County. The MSHDA Housing Choice Voucher Program operates on a waiting list system to manage the demand for affordable housing. In Washtenaw County, where the need is high, this waiting list can extend over several years. This lengthy wait often leads to considerable confusion and frustration for those seeking assistance. According to the County's website, there were over 2,400 vouchers administered in Washtenaw County in 2023, and 140 are reserved for homeless households. One major issue is that the waiting list is dynamic rather than static. Applicants are placed on the list based on their application date and need, but changes can occur, including additions or removals based on various criteria.This can make it difficult for applicants to understand their current standing and predict when they might receive assistance. Mercy House] and certain people at Delonis. It’s stupid. I owned a trailer and tried to apply for Section 8. It could have totally eliminated this process. I could have saved my place. “Seriously,” Amy continued. “I ROBBIE FEBRUARY Groundcover contributor Due to budget constraints, the HCV program will not release any new vouchers for the foreseeable future. During this time, MSHDA will close all HCV waitlists to new additions starting July 1, 2024, and waitlists will remain closed until the budget allows for new vouchers to be released. Budget shortfalls from the federal government coupled with rising housing costs have created a deficit in the program. Misunderstandings Complicating the process further are the project preferences that influence an applicant’s waiting list status. MSHDA administers the HCV Program with various housing projects and landlords, each with their own criteria for accepting tenants. Preferences may prioritize certain demographics, such as veterans or individuals with disabilities, which can affect an applicant’s placement on the waiting list. Steve shared his frustration with the lack of clarity in the process: “We were living at the Purple House for the winter a few days a week. That is when we got the first letter about being kicked off the list. I am not used to this craziness. I don’t know how any of this works.” Amy followed up, “We felt defeated. Like nobody cares, except people like Peggy [Lynch, founder of had 23 teeth taken out and had emergency surgery this month. Recovering in my car is hard. We are so thankful for the car, but I have neuropathy. Have you experienced waking up in the winter with burning hot feet? Like someone has a f***ing torch to your feet. But because of Peggy, no lie, this pain was significantly reduced. “ “Well, it’s shitty that someone has to recover from surgery sleeping on a floor or in a car seat,” I replied. “Duh,” Amy and Steve say in unison. Administrative challenges and communication barriers Administrative challenges within MSHDA itself further contribute to the difficulties. Bureaucratic processes can create barriers to effective communication and management of the waiting list. Many applicants, including Steve and Amy, report struggles with reaching MSHDA staff, receiving timely responses, or understanding the instructions provided. “I felt like we had no support from the County,” Steve noted. MSHDA’s website and online resources, while useful, might not always be up-to-date or comprehensive. Applicants often rely on these resources for guidance, but outdated information can lead to misunderstandings about the waiting list process.The people who help locally are Delonis Center and HAWC (Housing Access of Washtenaw County). Steve and Amy stayed in their car often last winter. They not only suffered from below freezing temperatures, they were also harassed by law enforcement. Steve said, “We were targeted by the police in November. Received multiple tickets on back to back days while caring for a friend sleeping in our car.” “Get one ticket that I can’t afford to pay, then I get a late fee. My tags are soon expired and I can’t get them updated until I catch up with the tickets. Even if we are homeless, we pay taxes. These $100 tickets have Robbie (right) interviewing Amy and Steve (left, middle). see HCV page 8  GROUNDCOVER NEWS What’s Happening at the Ann Arbor District Library Open 10am–8pm Daily Hang out in any of our five locations across town, browsing books, magazines, newspapers, and more, or check out movies, CDs, art prints, musical instruments, and home tools— you name it!

The stress of it has caused a few medical concerns. We have had four surgeries between the two of us in the last 30 days. This isn’t any way to heal and it will cause us years of recovery that could have and should have been prevented.” Amy reaches out for Steve's hand and we continue the interview. “I met Steve in first grade.” Amy added, “I was married for 15 years with two kids. My husband passed away in 2015 and my life has been a mess since. I was 35 when he died. We had no insurance, nothing. I had a trailer in Wixom. Steve and I stayed in touch and started traveling together in November 2022. We were in the same situation, we were f***ed and let’s just say we were still f***ed. We chose to find shelter together compared to two bad separate home situations.” Steve said “The first letter we got [from MSHDA] stated that it was determined that we were housed. I was like ‘When? And how the f*** did anyone determine we were housed?’ We followed up with them and I felt the community was turning on me. We were in a lot of contact with PATH. Or maybe sh*t got lost in the shuffle. Last year, PATH would come out and check on us. This year I feel like we have no support from the County.\" Addressing the confusion To address these issues in Washtenaw County, several measures could be considered: 1. Improve mail handling: Ensuring reliable mail delivery for shelters like the Delonis Center is crucial. MSHDA should work with these facilities to resolve mail issues and explore alternative communication methods, such as digital notifications or secure online portals. 2. Improve communication: The HCV program could improve its communication strategies by providing clear, updates about the waiting list process. Enhancing accessibility through multiple communication channels would also be beneficial. 3. Clarify project preferences: Offering transparent information about project preferences and criteria would help applicants understand how these factors affect their waiting list status. Clear guidelines can aid applicants in making more informed decisions. 4. Simplifying administrative procedures: This will improve efficiency and reduce delays. Investing in technology and staff training might enhance waiting list management and applicant experience. 5. Provide educational resources: Offering workshops or resources to educate applicants about the waiting detailed instructions and list process, their rights, and available options can empower them to navigate the system more effectively. By tackling these areas, MSHDA can better support applicants like Steve and Amy, reducing the stress and uncertainty associated with the waiting list and ultimately providing more effective and equitable affordable housing assistance. MSHDA will continue to provide rental assistance on behalf of current HCV participants as their program participation is not impacted by the shortfall. MSHDA may continue to assist families in these programs: Project-Based Voucher program, Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, and the Stability Voucher program. People who are seeking publicly funded housing should take heart. Many other states have suspended their waiting lists only to reopen them again. New York recently reopened a previously closed list. Over two hundred thousand people applied for less than three thousand vouchers, but there are other opportunities as well. Steve adds a personal note: “I can still beat up on some of those younger guys on the disc golf course. When I’m done, I’ll whip them up with a tasty dish of Stevey sauce served on my favorite disc.” His humor underscores the resilience and determination that keep him and Amy going despite the challenges they face. exp. 01/31/2025 AUGUST 9, 2024 AUGUST 9, 2024 PUZZLES 1 13 16 18 23 28 31 34 37 44 47 50 56 61 63 Groundcover Vendor Code While Groundcover is a non-profit, and paper vendors are self-employed contractors, we still have expectations of how vendors should conduct themselves while selling and representing the paper.

My saving grace is that as a grandson of George Glenn Cameron, a former archaeologist and History teacher, I followed in his footsteps as a student of anthropology at Eastern Michigan University. My understanding of the Iliad is due to the writing style of Homer, and my being a student of Hermetic and Ceremonial Magic, and a lover of the mysteries of the gods/goddesses. And that Homer begins his book not as a dry run of the history of the Trojan War, but as dialogue between man and the divine. Homer's books “The Iliad” and “The Odyssey” are required reading in many programs of Great Books, one of which, from beginning to end, \"St. John's College, the Freshman level of Great Books,\" I am determined to finish in my spare time. All of us have at our disposal time to read ten pages a day of a particular book, in a form of self sacrifice of what else we may do with that amount of time on a daily basis. This tale covers the Trojan War in prose style of classical literature. Not being an avid fan of history but rather religion and the anthropology of religion no less, it is fortuitous that the story begins as a dialogue between Man and his Divine source. Great heroes of the time are included in this tale. The Trojans and the Achaeans are both covered in this battle. I must admit it took more than just the text in an English translation from Classical Greek, supplemented by Spark Notes and Cliffs Notes for me to comprehend the book. How does this relate to homelessness and economic struggles in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti? A fair question. It is because we all have inner battles and wars, sometimes spilling out into the physical realm — as within so without, as without, so within. In understanding a ship’s crew in waters unknown, seeking dry land on which to dock and pursue unknown treasure, we can find that literature is a great treasure, helping us to understand life and death itself. Is death always easier than life?If we think so we are sadly mistaken, as it (Death) is our greatest foe we all must face, and we can choose to enter into it in the role of Coward or Hero. This is not to say that Death is easy, nay, very much the opposite. The best we can do is to live a virtuous life and enter into the great unknown as a courageous hero, having fought our wars in life itself before meeting our ultimate end, seeking perhaps the very hand of Helen, Hera or the hand of Jove. Our next foe of life is that of ignorance. To this end I seek to aid you, my dear reader, with a condensed underJAMIE CAMERON Groundcover vendor No. 612 by the gods, and Agamemnon powerful himself as captain of the fleet and king of Mycenae. The Acheans (Greeks) sought to make war with the Trojans due to the lying spirit sent by Jove in the dream of Agamemnon. It was stated in the dream that they, the Acheans, would fight the Trojans and take the city of Troy. I am currently on the second book of The Iliad, so forgive my ignorance in writing this before finishing the book itself. A parallel to what is occurring in this standing of The Iliad. We can find in this story (and perhaps why Virgil and Shakespeare appear in my mind as I read this great tale) the Trickster God, or a god in his malicious role. In the form of a dream, the God Jove sent this lying spirit to the captain of the fleet. Many of us may view Jove, or Jupiter, as not only a father of gods and goddesses, but as the very source itself, both in roles of the trickster and a non-trickster. If we view life as a potential of a trickster as well as reality, a dream or in our waking up to reality from a world of dream, we may see a parallel, and that is what I seek to leave you with. We in this world may not be unarmed, but none of us can afford to stroll down the street armed with spears and swords and shields. Nay, this would immediately put us in bonds. So I implore you to consider the times in which this tale took place. We now have the benefit of entire libraries at our disposal, a benefit of our times, despite those who seek to burn or ban books. Ignorance is our greatest foe. May libraries become your — our — sanctuary, with a common theme as we seek to learn and understand, not just use it as a warming or cooling center as we go about our days and nights. Nay, make much use of these centers of learning. If the internet fails to work on a given day, there are still words on paper from which we can extract an education. With that, I invite you to join me in the quest to understand the point of The Iliad and its characters, and perhaps see in our modern times the parallels to being homeless. As you read this, we are seeing multiple wars across the globe, which in itself seek natural resources and people to exploit, and to seek treasures in the form of human and political power, money a bonus. Achilles is not just a Greek restaurant, but a great man of renown, a hero. In Book One of The Iliad, Homer presents a quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, with Achilles aided world is a competition between two parties seeking to take control of the United States, one as just another leader, while one wants to be not just a man but a king and God. You feel me on this point? If not, here is the spoiler — Harris and Trump. Where this intersects with the homeless is by which social programs or policies one or the other seeks to exploit, corrupt or completely take away. Let us view Troy as the United States, and the treasures sought as the money behind the social programs and domestic and foreign policies. Troy was set up to fall, aided by the gods, the hand of Helen as the prize to gain in a major war between the Acheans and the Trojans. Helen may very well be the voting process, our democracy, as opposed to a monarchy that one party seeks. This will affect each and every one of us, in high places and low. So who are the Acheans and who are the Trojans? And of what shall be the fate of Troy? What gods shall we appease with burnt offerings? Where is the hand of Jove or Zeus himself in all of this? This may be viewed on the global theater: in Venezuela a tied election for or against the people; Ukraine, if victorious, will prevent a dictator from taking other countries at will. Should Ukraine fail to be aided by the gods, let us hope the hand of Zeus and AUGUST 9, 2024 Hera be with us all. Let us set up altars for our household gods and goddesses, with regular offerings and praise. In the end, let us hope our democracy stays and stands through our Heroine, rather than the man who wants to be King and a God himself. Let the trickle-down effect be seen, heard and felt in favor of the common (wo)man of this city of Troy (the United States). Let the Olympics not be a distraction in all of this. Let Olympus’s gods and goddesses reign, and not man. Let the treasure (our election process) remain safe and guarded in the open, along with its trickle-down programs and policies. - AUGUST 9, 2024 AROUND TOWN Operation robin rescue: do's and dont's I was on my way to the library. I had some applications to follow up on and I was going to orate my article for the Groundcover Speaks podcast. I was just making my way as I usually do —shouting obscenities at passersby and generally being offensive — when I saw a baby bird on the ground. This little bird didn't look happy. I looked up and I saw the nest, which was WAY TOO HIGH!!! I couldn’t reach it. I was faced with a choice: I could give up my plans for the morning or say “that’s life in the big city” to the bird and keep moving. I picked up the little bird and I wondered what to do. I couldn't leave him to the ants, the life of a bird is short enough and they would get theirs soon enough. A man walked up to a pick-up truck nearby and I asked him if he would help. He said yes! But when we examined the area below the nest site his truck was not going to fit. “Oy vey,” he said with a sad look on his face. He wanted to help, but the planters by the tree were not gonna move. Those planters have to weigh tons! So I thanked the kind man and I figured maybe someone at the Groundcover office might help? They sure weren't expecting me to walk into the office at that time and definitely not with some kind of dang baby bird. But I did it anyway. I thought maybe there would be a step ladder or something we could get. Many people were apprehensive about the bird's fate. Many said, “You touched it, now the momma bird will reject it.” I explained if I didn't the poor bird was destined to be ant food, so I had to try. It turns out I did the right thing. I went outside the office and turned over rocks till I found a grub and two worms. I didn't go full on momma bird and chew them up, but I did smash them a bit. The bird bros had this to say: “If you find a baby bird, it likely does not need your help unless it is featherless or has its eyes closed. These birds are nestlings and aren’t ready to leave the nest yet. If you can locate the nest nearby, the How to Help a Grounded Baby Bird When you come upon a hatchling or TONY SMITH Groundcover contributor nestling on the ground, look for a nest in the area; it’s likely to be within a few yards. Then follow these steps: (1) Put on gloves (or, if you don’t have gloves, wash your hands). (2) Gently pick up the baby bird and place it back into the nest. Note: If the nest has been damaged best thing to do is simply place the nestling back in the nest. If you cannot locate the nest, leave the nestling where you found it or move it to a shaded area. The parents will come back. Don’t worry, your scent won’t deter the parents. “As birds get bigger, they outgrow the nest and need room to move around, flap their wings and learn to fly. These more developed birds are fledglings and they can easily be identified by their more developed feathers. They can hop and flutter on their own. Fledglings don’t need help — their parents are nearby and still caring for them. Be sure to give them plenty of space.” (US Fish and Wildlife) It's important to know the stages of a bird; when they first leave the nest it might be awkward. My guy seemed like late stage two to me. Baby birds go through three stages: Hatchling (usually 0-3 days old). It hasn’t yet opened its eyes, and may have wisps of down on its body. It’s not ready to leave the nest. Nestling (usually 3-13 days old). Its eyes are open, and its wing feathers may look like tubes because they’ve yet to break through their protective sheaths. It’s also not ready to leave the nest. Fledgling (13-14 days old or older). This bird is fully feathered. Its wings and tail may be short, and it may not be a great flyer, but it can walk, hop or flutter. It has left the nest, though its parents may be nearby, taking good care of it. or is too high to reach, you can place the bird in a woven basket from your local garden store and hang it on a low branch. A basket looks to birds like a natural nest and the weave design will allow rainwater to drain through it and prevent the baby bird from drowning. Watch from a distance to see if the parent comes back to the nest. This may take a few hours, so if you can’t stay, try to come back later that day to check. If the parent bird doesn’t return to the nest, or you can’t find the nest: 1. Using gloved or clean hands, place the bird in a container (e.g., a shoe box) lined with soft cloth. You can use paper towels, a baby blanket or a piece of clothing. 2. If you have a heating pad, place it on the lowest setting and put it under the soft bedding to keep the baby bird warm. A hot water bottle also works well. 3. Place the box with the baby bird in a dark, quiet place away from people and pets. 4. Don’t give the bird food or water. 5. Contact your local wildlife rehabilitation center to arrange for further care. I left the Groundcover office with the bird in a blue laundry container. I’d squished a few worms and a grub. I was this bird's mommy now — a mommy from Hell! I had a chair and one of the Groundcover reporters came with me in case I needed a hand. I was grateful for her because my plan involved balancing on a chair made during the Eisenhower administration. As luck would have it things would work out perfectly. When we arrived at the corner I soon found out that the chair was not going to cut it. So I had the idea of trying the library; the librarian was helpful but no one was available to help. So I returned to the scene. The little bird was chirping and its mother stood a distance away calmly watching the situation. Its little mouth opened wide and its eyes squinted hard so I gave it the last of the worms while I figured what to do. It was then birdy lightning struck. Across the street were two guys one with a ladder of just the right size and another with a pull cart. I yelled and gesticulated wildly as I ran across the street. The look on their faces was definitely one of trepidation. That all changed when I told them the situation. They gladly came to aid in my mission of mercy. We set up the ladder and got to business. During this time I learned that the pair worked for the city hanging banners on street lamps and putting up posters. Very likely you have passed their work many times. They may not paint the art for the pieces they hang, but if not for them and their coworkers the many beautiful pieces would not be hung so often and changed with good regularity. In an instant the heroes of this story turned from regular working guys into an elite bird rescue team. As a backup, I had the number of the nature rehab people on deck, but as you will see in the film [https://files. catbox.moe/5m22x3.mp4], everything worked out. A few days on everything looks fine, I’ve checked and no dead Birdy :). I did see their mother catching worms the next day, and heard the wee birds' near-ravenous peeping. As I was doing the final revising of this piece I had another interesting bird experience. This time with a fledgling (the last stage of baby birds). It landed on my back and proceeded to chirp in my ears for like ten minutes. In this stage of bird development the birds can fly, but they are still learning. A nice lady wanted to keep the bird because she thought it was lost. Enjoy and be kind to our feathered friends. GROUNDCOVER NEWS 11  HOUSTON from page 4 implement the Housing First model with varying degrees of success and failure. Atlanta says that they succeeded in reducing their community’s homeless population by 40% by using the Housing First approach. Dallas and Salt Lake City saw some improvements. However, Los Angeles is still searching for a significant improvement after implementing the Housing First strategy. Grand Rapids/ Kent County’s coalition to end homelessness which includes more than 60 Continuum of Care partners recently plans to house 100 chronically homeless people within 100 days. Houston’s Housing First success story should resonate with local and state government leaders who are searching for durable solutions to their challenges with unhoused, unsheltered and growing street homelessness. Houston presents a good case study. National Alliance to End Homelessness research has shown that Housing First is more cost effective than traditional rapid rehousing programs. Washtenaw County is not as large an urban county as Harris County. However, Ann Arbor, the County Seat, lacks affordable housing. Rent inflation continues to be too high. Ypsilanti is somewhat more affordable, but the cost of housing is rising there, too. Local and state governments should implement Housing First policies but they will likely need economic support from the federal government to make substantial headway.\n\n2 GROUNDCOVER NEWS GROUNDCOVER voting INFORMATION NEXT ELECTION Tuesday, August 6: Primary election — Federal, state and local candidates, proposals Tuesday, November 5: General election VIEW PERSONALIZED VOTING INFORMATION www.vote411.org • See what's on your ballot • Check your voter registration • Find your polling place • Discover upcoming debates in your area EARLY VOTING INFORMATION Michigan voters now have the right to vote early in-person during nine (9) full days prior to every major election.

That immigrant was me. Since then, I spent many years working and now I don’t owe anything to anyone. Now I feel sick at 65 years, with no family, and the only thing I have is my job selling papers. I have no free time and own nothing; everything is given to me for free by the American government, thanks to the federal laws in this country. Still this is a racist country because of ICE. Now it’s even worse. I lost my Section 8 title because the waitlist closed and now have no more prospects for housing. If I was living in another state, and the police caught me sleeping outside, I would need to pay a $250 fine. Everyday, new, more discriminatory laws are passed. That’s why I don’t like this country anymore. Hace 44 años, en Estados Unidos, un desgraciado de la policía estatal en el estado de Indiana en el condado de Valparaíso usó el control de imigración y un ilegal perdió todos sus derechos al firmar una deportación voluntaria. Ese ilegal era yo. Después, he pasado muchos años trabajando y no tengo que darle cuenta a nadie. Ahora me siento enfermo con 65 años de edad, sin familia, y lo único que tengo es mi trabajo de vendedor de periódicos. No tengo un día libre y sin nada, todo me lo da grátis el gobierno americano. Gracias a las leyes federales de este país. Sin embargo, este es un país racista. Ahora es mucho peor. Ya no tengo mi vale de Sección 8 porque la lista de espera se cerró y así no tengo más vivienda. Si yo viviera en otro estado y la policía me atrapara durmiendo en la calle, tendría que pagar una multa de 250 dólares. A cada día, nueves leyes más discriminatorias son aprobadas. Por eso no me gusta más este país. GROUNDCOVER NEWS 3 I'll miss June and July June and July are two of my favorite months to celebrate holidays. In June, there’s Juneteenth celebrating how God and Jesus helped people be free. People also barbecue and have good food and get togethers for Juneteenth. I also like to celebrate Christmas any month I can, including the summer months. June and July are two good months to barbecue and have celebrations and have fun. I also like to send cards and get and give Christmas presents in June and July too. I like to go to places where my friends are, like Growing Hope and FedUp Ministries in Ypsilanti.

There’s a lot of interesting people and artwork. Those are the ways I like to celebrate June and July. decision we have a true patriot who showed us he didn't just talk the talk, but walked the walk. Now it is time for us to come together. We have a moment in time where we can change the narrative, where we can run political campaigns on our accomplishments, not on our opponents' failures. It's time for us to take a quick breath and take a good look at both candidates, not have them just attack one another. A time to find who has the integrity to have the light shine on them and not come up wanting. So we are saying goodbye to a person who has spent most of his adult life serving the people: Joe Biden. It would be so easy to take pot shots at both parties. I’ll follow the President of the United States — Joe Biden's — lead and see if this novel idea of doing what's best for the people resonates and catches on!\n\n4 GROUNDCOVER NEWS VOTING I remember the first time I voted and became a part of the democratic process … but why? Black Men here in the United States of America, a lot of us feel our vote doesn't matter or won’t have no-real effect on our situation here in America; in short, we are totally detached and have no faith in the democratic process. But it is projected that there will be 34.4 million eligible Black voters by election time in November 2024. Black voter turnout rates are projected to be higher than Hispanics and Asians. The first time I voted was when Barack Obama first won the presidency in 2008. The reason I voted for him was simply because of his skin color. Not because he was a Democrat or his ideas and values were in line with my own; I never thought about what type of policies he might administer. How naive I was then. Now, seventeen years later, I am much wiser. Still, I have to mention his skin color caught my attention and put me in the game of the democratic process. During Barack Obama’s presidency I started becoming detached and decided not to participate in the 2012 election.Then Trump came along in 2016 and swept the nation by storm, with it at times. This upcoming election I will be casting my vote and hope others will do the same. I met a brother in the downtown Ann Arbor area named Todd Wilson, the Michigan lead organizer and consultant of Black Men Vote. As we talked, he let me know that MIKE JONES Groundcover vendor No. 113 catching everybody's attention. He turned ordinary news stations into political entertainment narcotics; people became hooked on Trump news. Now, I must mention that Trump news got me back into the game of the process of democracy again. Both Obama and Trump caught the attention of the masses, including those people who would have never paid attention to politics. Sometimes it takes extreme figures and/or situations to get people's attention and to get them involved. Ever since 2016, I have been back in the game, being a part of the democratic process, even though I struggle Frank White, known as former President Barack Obama’s top fundraiser, started BMV in January 2024. BMV is currently partnered with “Shop Talk,” the flagship of the campaign currently operating in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The goal is to get 55-60 barbershops, beauty salons and barber schools involved with helping to get Black Men registered and participating in the democratic process.” As he continued, he informed why he decided to get involved and engage in Black Men voter mobilization and voter registration. “Because I noticed a voter deficit, if we look at the polls, our voter turnout rate was the lowest nationally; only 12 percent of Black registered voters came out to vote in the last Michigan Primary election. Shop Talk is geared towards changing that trajectory, by mobilizing Black Men to get them engaged or reengaged into the JULY 26, 2024 Black Men Vote mobilizes voters in barber shops democratic process. As men, we are looked-up to in the household and in our communities. People watch us; therefore, we can lead by example, and we can change the trajectory, when it comes to our vote as a whole, in our community. Black Men being involved allows for Black Men to be more informed on issues, and allows us as Black Men to have a voice in the political arena on issues that matter to us.” Then I asked him about the types of responses that have been received since the start of BMV. He said, “Voter mobilization; people are really getting behind it and getting involved. We also look to partner with various organizations and with state and local governments soon; things have been going well.” I had one last question for Todd: How can people register to vote and get involved with BMV? He said, “If you want to get more information on Black Men Vote, you can go to our website blackmenvote.org and you can register to vote on our website and also get valuable information needed for the upcoming election.” So, there you have it folks, exercise your right and vote! Three City of Ypsilanti ballot initiatives to look for during November election LINDSAY CALKA Publisher Ypsilanti Ballot Initiative Group (Ypsi BIG) is a newly formed group of organizers in Ypsilanti that has nearly collected 900 signatures on three separate ballot petitions aimed at amending the Ypsilanti City Charter. The group includes members from Ypsilanti Tenants Union, What’s Left Ypsi, Eastern Michigan University, and former members of Defend Affordable Ypsi. Ypsi BIG began planning for the petitioning process early in 2024, drawing inspiration from an unsuccessful effort by Defend Affordable Ypsi in 2020, which attempted to instate rent control through a ballot petition process. Ypsi BIG surveyed a number of local grassroots organizations, considering over 10 possible charter amendments before deciding on three. A ballot initiative is a proposed law — in this case, a change to the City Charter — initiated by the electorate instead of by those in elected office. In order to get the proposed legislation on the ballot, a certain number of signatures must be collected and approved by a deadline. In addition to the standard tactic of door knocking and street canvassing at public events such as Ypsi Pride, First Fridays and Juneteenth, Ypsi BIG marketed the ballot initiatives on social media and directed interested signers to show up at a central location — Vertex Cafe, Sundays 1-4 p.m. — throughout June and July. Due to their efforts, close to 900 Ypsilanti residents have signed in favor of these changes and if the remainder of the signatures are collected and approved by the City Clerk by July 30, the measures will be up for general vote in the November 5 election. Read up on what each of the initiatives aim to do so you can make an informed decision on election day. 1. Public Control of Police Budget: Requires that any changes to the Ypsilanti Police Department budget be voted on as a stand-alone issue by the general public during a regular November election. 2. Non-partisan Local Elections: Would eliminate partisan voting for Mayor and City Council positions, Show up to Vertex Cafe Sunday, July 28 1-4 p.m. to sign and support the initiatives! which would mean that straight-ticket voting would not apply to those seats. This would also eliminate City Council and mayoral primary elections, which would effectively create more competitive races in November. 3. Tenant Rights: Would result in three big changes: 1) A ban on rental application fees, 2) A requirement for landlords to follow a Right of First Refusal law, and 3) A requirement for landlords to register all of their properties with the City on an accessible online database. There would be substantial financial penalties for landlords should they not follow this, and holding them accountable will be the job of City Council. Right of First Refusal mandates that landlords, if selling their rental properties, first offer to sell the property at market rate to the tenant(s) who live there. If you are interested in supporting the campaign for these initiatives, contact Ypsi BIG by visiting their website www.linktr.ee/ypsibig or messaging on Instagram @ypsi.big JULY 26, 2024 MAKING CHANGE Where is the revolution? KEN PARKS Groundcover vendor No. 490 It is often said, “You can kill the revolutionary but you can’t kill the revolution.” On the 4th of July, independence is tainted with a military flavor that usually promotes the military-industrial-financial complex that Eisenhower warned us about. Freedom of expression is limited by the idolatry of flag worship. Fireworks are a magical display that distract from the bombs that are regularly falling on someone in the world. The aspiration for freedom is born with the first breath of every baby. The potential for love and creativity which we recognize in a newborn is the human heritage we all embody. The real question may be, “Where is your inner child?” NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) did a study on genius, creativity and imagination and discovered that nearly all fiveyear-olds scored high. The rate declined with age and was down to 2% for adults. Google can teach us a lot but it is up to us to work with what we have. This means recognizing the plight of our inner child and doing the healing so that inner child and adult learn to communicate. I proposed a workshop at Crazy Wisdom with Joya D’Cruz on this theme and hope to have an announcement soon. Joya was mentored by Eugene Gendlin who wrote “Focusing,” an important book on mental health. Facing reality is a revolutionary act and can inspire you to become an active participant in your life. The dialectic of theory and practice is a lively one as the rhythm of joy appears. Today, July 1, is the anniversary of the jazz standard “Take Five,” the 5/4 rhythm that brightens our life. Search that when you are ready for a treat! Maybe we will play it on October 8 as the theme of my 82nd birthday. I was born just before the baby boomers who once said “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” There is some form of youth rebellion with every generation and the Gray Panthers slogan “Youth and Age Together” is one to remember. We can empower each other to follow through until the job is done. We will know when peace and justice replace compliance with the chain of command. Martha Reeves and the Vandellas sang about it, “Dancing In The Street.” Another treat at your fingertips. We have a long history of victories that seem to crumble just as we want to rest on our laurels. After the war in Vietnam, the ruling class broke the so-called Vietnam Syndrome with Ken Parks at the Ann Arbor Coalition Against the War Art Fair Booth. war in Granada and then Panama. The School of the Americas became known as the School of the Assassins and renamed itself to continue the wars of counterinsurgency. Read soaw.org for updates as the popular struggles continue in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in particular. The most recent victory in the global struggle for freedom is the release of Julian Assange. The popular movement in Australia gained enough momentum that politicians took notice and acted to release him after five years of prison which came on the heels of his controversial arrest at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he was in asylum for seven years. The bravery and persistence of Assange and his family and the struggle for freedom of the press is now legendary. Let’s follow through and support the whistleblowers in our midst. Water protectors — from Standing Rock in North Dakota to the Carrizo Comecrudo tribe of Texas, the original people of the Rio Grande — are active in exposing the extractive war on the environment. As Juan B. Mancias says, “Water is meant to unite, not divide.” I ordered a t-shirt with a striking photo of him and that quote. You can get one at the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas website. I am guilty of being active in both religion and politics, the two taboos of bourgeois culture. This French origin word refers to the capitalist class and sometimes middle class as people adjust to the geopolitical order of our time in history. The French and American Revolutions consolidated the end of feudalism and the deepening of the capitalist revolution which is ripening for the next step towards freedom. This is the responsibility we share as we learn that reality is a seamless whole, that awareness is the next step in our evolution to genuine revolution. James Boggs and Grace Lee Boggs are legendary in Detroit and beyond for their life of theory and practice that you can visit in the book “Evolution and Revolution in the 20th Century.” When your life’s purpose becomes a shared purpose with others, the power that arises is formidable. If your intention is to benefit all beings without exception, countless world systems will arise. When inner space and outer space come together, infinity takes a dive into the Clear Light of the Void. This is the moment when masters of mindful awareness will be welcomed into your inner circle of significant beings. Suffering becomes a force to seek the cure. When we discover that reality is a workable situation, the revolution of unconditional love will erase all the conceptual prisons that have enslaved us from beginningless time. Unimpeded awareness becomes a victory celebration. Imagine that! I must mention that July 26 is celebrated in Cuba as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. Although the attack on the Moncada barracks was a failure, it marked the beginning of open resistance to the Batista dictatorship. I regularly ask my Cuban family “Where is the revolution?” and the response is always “Where is it?” We have unfinished revolutions in many places. Awareness with dignity and confidence will help us weave many local fabrics into a beautiful global quilt. “The Invention of Wings” is a wonderful book on quilts and freedom. The historic friendship of a slavemaster’s daughter and a slave girl is the inspiration for this book by Sue Monk Kidd, who many know from “The Secret Life of Bees.” This world is an amazing place when your curiosity comes out of the closet. The revolution begins here. Since no one can do everything, it is good to tune in to whatever speaks to you and know that anything you do is interrelated and that everyday life is the main stage. Daily mindful awareness practice is my recommendation on where to start. Your inner child is ready to play the game of life. Just as the sun rises everyday, raise yourself to a daily practice of engaged living. The revolution lives in your heart. GROUNDCOVER NEWS 5\n\n6 GROUNDCOVER NEWS AUGUST PRIMARY Who will be the new sheriff in town? JIM CLARK Groundcover vendor No. 139 County Sheriff’s Departments are charged with the same things police officers are — investigating crimes and arresting criminals. Little regard is given by law enforcement for the circumstances under which crimes are committed or the state-of-life the “criminals” are in. Law is blind. So it doesn’t care if your parents abused you and now you perpetuate crimes of abuse. It doesn’t care if you fell to peer pressure and now are addicted to something. Law doesn’t care if you have mental illness or are simply a person built to live outside of norms. The point of the law does not seem to be to protect and serve as much as it is to arrest and punish. Washtenaw County is about to elect a new sheriff. This means almost nothing to abolitionists and anti-capitalists; however, it is worth paying attention to who will be holding this position of power. As a young activist, I was told that I could work within the system to change it from the inside. I have tried this and have seen others try it. It rarely works. Real change is not going to come from within this system; it will only come from complete deconstruction of the system. However, there is some sentiment within the ranks of law enforcement towards abolition. I interviewed each candidate to learn where they stand on abolition, reallocating public funds to mental health care, and on community-led actions to solve homelessness. Here are the takes from the candidates: What Interested You in Police Work? Alyshia Dyer: “I grew up extremely low-income in Ypsilanti, raised by a single parent, and had a lot of childhood trauma. I ran away from home a lot and at one point was falsely arrested and treated badly by the police. These experiences motivated me to get into law enforcement to be a more compassionate officer who really cared about people in our community. I also wanted to change things in law enforcement that I knew were harming people I cared about.” After completing her bachelor’s degree at Eastern Michigan University, Dyer earned advanced degrees from Gerald R. Ford School of Policy and the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan. She served as a road patrol deputy and a marine deputy at the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s office for nearly a decade. Derrick Jackson: “Originally I was JULY 26, 2024 Alyshia Dyer: Ypsilanti native who wants to end over-policing. just interested in systems work, like doing things in my neighborhood that could make the lives of people who were living in the community better. I left direct service social work because every day I would help a young person but there was always another family coming back who needed more help.” Jackson took on a job at the County Clerk's office where he met Jerry Clayton, Washtenaw County Sheriff. As Jackson tells the story, “I went into work at the Clerk's office where I met this guy [Jerry Clayton] who had this crazy idea about doing social work through a police agency. Honestly that's what pulled me into it. I didn't grow up wanting to be a police officer. It was literally this idea of doing social work and police work together.” Ken Magee: “I was a young and rambunctious person who had a good family but was running the neighborhood being mischievous, always pushing the envelope. I was never a bully. Instead, I stuck up for the kids who were getting bullied. In high school, my mentors encouraged me to channel my rambunctiousness into police work.” Two of Magee's mentors were Keith Hafner and Ed Sells, owners of Keith Hafner’s Karate in downtown Ann Arbor. There he met FBI agents. “This led to exploring a career in police work,” Ken recalled. “Numerous cops have the same story as me.” Magee graduated first in his police academy and was class president. Being very competitive, his chief challenger is always himself. He excels in all he does — martial arts, police work and writing. Magee has written four books about University of Michigan football. His law enforcement tenure includes involvement with the Drug Enforcement Administration and, as Magee puts it, “facing down some of the most dangerous criminals on the planet.” Derrick Jackson: Bringing social work to police work by restoring communities. On Abolition Dyer: “I’m never going to call myself an abolitionist because it’s hypocritical to do that and run for a position like sheriff. I will say I have read about this extensively, and what it means to me is recognizing that many of our systems were originally designed around harmful practices. Sheriffs, for example, historically were born out of slave patrols in the South and helped promote mass incarceration. Present-day, we try to push back on these roots, but there are still realities in the design of law enforcement that cause harm, even when the people working inside the system don’t intentionally mean to cause harm. I believe in reducing harm in this space as sheriff so that we are working towards new strategies to create safer communities. We also have to be more honest from a police administration standpoint about how over-policing has contributed to violence. I know so many young people who got zero support until they got into trouble. Then the support was very punitive. It didn’t help. “Abolitionists I know and have talked to, at the end of the day, believe in a Ken Magee: Former DEA agent who \"thinks outside the badge.\" better world where everyday people aren’t being extorted, oppressed and harmed by systems that are supposed to protect us. Some of the principles, including investing more upstream and investing more in solutions for safety, hit home for me as someone who grew up in an area where opportunity is defined by zip code. My goal as sheriff is to make sure we are responding adequately to calls for service but also doing so in the least harmful way possible and ensuring we are doing our part to invest in root-cause solutions to better public safety. We need more deflection and diversion, and we need more restorative justice to offer healing for when victims of crime want to go a different route.” Jackson: “I think …” He paused and then started again. “Listen, we're all trying to work towards abolition. How do we actually get there? It would be great if we didn't have deaths or homicides or serious assaults, right? There's a lot of social ills out there. And I think as a social worker, I have these ideals of what we would be like as a society if kids weren't picking up guns and see SHERIFF next page  JULY 26, 2024 ARTS CONTEST GROUNDCOVER NEWS 7 Vote for your favorite mixed media piece and view submissions to the other three categories online at linktr.ee/groundcovernews Voting closes August 5!

I work so that those mothers don't have to wake up and hear me telling them that their son had been murdered. So I would love to see that stuff [abolition] in the future. I think it's just about how we get there.” Magee: “The prison system is not the responsibility of the sheriff, as the sheriff is in charge of the jail. I believe a jail and a prison both have their own respective purpose. However, any incarceration system can be improved to facilitate the ultimate goal of rehabilitation. Example, literacy, teaching the trades, advancing education, all part of the rehabilitation process. The abolition of the incarceration system is not something I believe in, but continually assessing the desired outcomes and what research and analysis presents.” On Alternatives to Policing Dyer: “Beyond policing, we need to address the root causes of crime and focus on creating safe, supportive and stable communities. We also have to admit the effect over-policing has had on our community, disproportionately affecting Black residents in Washtenaw County. We must tackle the high racial disparities in our legal system, particularly involving youth. Investments at the neighborhood level, providing better support for young people, and addressing social determinants of health are crucial for building safe communities in addition to minimizing the harm caused by our local legal system. Criminalizing low-level offenses by using heavy-handed traffic enforcement tactics only exacerbates problems, especially for young people, and we must adopt more supportive and restorative approaches. “We will do our job as law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes but what we won’t do is criminalize whole neighborhoods by stopping people for petty reasons that aren’t related to safety concerns. We also need to make more evidence-based investments at the neighborhood level to increase safety, especially to reduce traffic fatalities. This is why I also heavily support traffic calming infrastructure.” (Author's note: I’m including the second paragraph because while I believe in a non-police society, there will still be a need for people to pay attention to safety issues. Like kittens, humans are frequently guilty of petty stupidity. As a result, we will need fire departments when a candle gets knocked over by a cat, or air lifts for the hiker who slipped and fell down a hole. We don’t need police, but we all need a little help from time to time.) Jackson: “I think we're trying to eliminate social ills in unhealthy communities, in general. I think that's what social work is about, right? It's about helping people not just deal with the crisis, but help them move from crisis to self-sustainability, to live healthy and thriving lives. Any neighborhood that is safe, is also well. And so police and social work go together because you can't have safe communities unless you have well communities. So that's literally how I think these two things really go together. “But I also think, if we were serious, even abolitionists, if we were really serious, we would be investing in communities that have been disinvested in for generations. Where I grew up, where I raised my family, those communities intentionally have been disinvested from. So if we're serious about it, it isn't only about these policy tweaks to policing. We've got to invest in our communities in very different ways.” Magee: “Great question! Outside of policing [there are] literacy projects.” Magee explains there is a connection between criminal behavior and literacy. “Opportunities can be provided for people who are returning citizens, such as housing, and employment, but these are outside of [the sheriff’s] function. “What would it take to abolish the police and have a society that polices itself should have happened two centuries ago. I don't see it. I believe that there will always be predators. Individuals violate the law for their own benefit.” Magee's approach to improving policing is by “thinking outside the badge,” not the box. Magee says this means “maintaining your true values to law enforcement. To protect and serve. It’s not just about reducing crime, it’s about the police force voicing our concerns about what we feel would make us safe and protected.” On Community-led Emergency Shelter Dyer: “I am committed to being a strong advocate for self-led community emergency shelters. As sheriff, I will work to ensure these shelters are safe and that we prevent over-policing in these spaces. My experience as a deputy has shown me the harsh reality of people turning themselves in on old warrants during winter months just to stay warm. We must do better by supporting investments in shelter and providing the necessary resources to keep people safe and housed. We also need to do better in our jail so when see SHERIFF page 11 \n\n10 GROUNDCOVER NEWS POETRY “Kidnapped from her West African home in 1762 and sold into slavery, Phillis Wheatley grew up to become the first popular African American poet. She was also the first African American and the first slave to publish a book of poems.” — Britannica Kids website The story of Phillis Wheatley is one which appeals to both the younger and the older generation. She was a trailblazer. When we talk about early Black literary achievements, her contributions and her excellence loom large. This is our fourth and last article about early Black writers and poets of America. The author plans to encourage more discussion and dialogues on this topic at some bookstores and coffee houses in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. Stay tuned for some announcements and community invitations. Biography of Phillis Wheatley Historians do not have the exact birthday for Phillis Wheatley. Many have suggested that she was seven or eight when she was abducted and sold into slavery in 1761. She was a young girl when the slave ship brought her to the shores of Boston. A wealthy tailor, John Wheatley, purchased the little girl to be a servant to his wife, Suzanna. Soon, Suzanna and John noticed Phillis had reading and writing abilities. Suzanna and her young daughter, Mary, started to teach young Phillis English, grammar, religion, Greek, Latin and English literature. Within two years, Phillis could read and write clearly in English. She also demonstrated proficiency in Latin. She mastered the styles and techniques of popular poets by the time she turned 14. A Britannica Kids online article said that as a teenager of 14, Phillis had a poem published in the Newport Mercury Newspaper of Rhode Island. Later, other poems by Phillis appeared in Boston publications. Phillis’s poems were influenced by the words of poets John Milton, Thomas Gray and Alexander Pope. Britannica Kids observes that in 1770, her “An Elegiac Poem, on the Death of the Celebrated Divine … George Whitefield’ was published first in a locally-produced pamphlet and then in newspapers throughout British America and England.” Britannica kids continued, “...the poem’s wide distribution brought her recognition as the ‘extraordinary poetical genius of New England.’ Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon and a WILL SHAKESPEARE Groundcover vendor No. 258 friend of Whitefield, invited the young poet to England and sought a publisher for her works.” According to Poets.org, Phillis traveled to London, England, in 1771, accompanied by Nathaniel Wheatley, son of John and Suzanna Wheatley. She had put together a collection of her poems into a book, “Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.” In London, she was well-received. The book of 39 poems was published in London and she dedicated it to Countess Selina Hastings. While in London, she met with some dignitaries, including William Legge, second earl of Dartmouth, the abolitionist Granville Sharpe and Benjamin Franklin. She was unable to meet the countess who invited her to England, because when Suzanna became ill in 1773, Phillis hurried back to Boston to help her recover. Poets.org noted: “In 1776, Wheatley wrote a letter and a poem in support of George Washington, who replied with an invitation to visit him ...” Phillis was freed from slavery before Suzanna’s death in 1774. After John Wheatley died, Phillis tried to support herself as a seamstress and a poet. Phillis married a free Black man known as John Peters in 1778. He was a grocer and a lawyer. The couple had three children. Mr. Peters abandoned Phillis and her children. To provide for her kids, Phillis became a maid in a boardinghouse. Two of her children died while she experienced poverty. Britannica kids noted, “On December 5, 1784, Wheatley and her third child died within hours of each other. They were buried together in an unmarked grave.” A very sad tragedy! Historians tell us that Phillis continued to write poems until her last day on earth. However, she was unable to find publishers for her books of poems. About 50 years after her death, in 1834, “Memoirs of Phillis Wheatley” was published. Another book, titled “Letters of Phillis Wheatley, the Negro-slave of Boston,” was published in 1864. Britannica Kids noted that abolitionists refer to Phillis Wheatley’s On Being Brought from Africa to America 'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too: Once I redemption neither sought nor knew. Some view our sable race with scornful eye, \"Their colour is a diabolic die.\" Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train. writing as a refutation of society’s claim in the 18th and 19th centuries that “African Americans were intellectually inferior to Whites.” Many legacies Wheatley left an impressive legacy of brave and thoughtful African American women writers. It took several decades in the 1800s before Frances Ellen Watkins Harper became the first African American woman to publish a short story. Harper was both an abolitionist and a suffragette. Other Black women writers and women rights activists displayed their talents in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Women writers who were inspired by Wheatley’s sense of empowerment and excellence include Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale-Hurston, Shirley Graham DuBois, Lorraine Hansberry, Toni Morrison, Audrey Lorde, Angela Davis, Maya Angelou, Amanda Garman, Nikole Hannah Jones and Isabel Wilkerson, to mention a few. Harvard scholar and historian Henry Louis Gates paid tribute to Phillis Wheatley in his recent books, “The Black Box” and “The Trial of Phillis Wheatley.” In the latter book, Dr. Gates said, “In 1773, the slave Phillis Wheatley literally wrote her way to freedom. The first person of African descent to publish a book of poems in English, she was emancipated by her owners in recognition of her literary achievement. For a time, Wheatley was the most famous Black person in the West. But Thomas Jefferson, unlike his contemporaries Ben Franklin and George Washignton, refused to acknowledge her gift as a writer — a repudiation that eventually inspired generations of Black writers to build an extraordinary body of literature in their efforts to prove him wrong.” JULY 26, 2024 Phillis Wheately: a pioneer of Black literary excellence PUZZLE SOLUTIONS JULY 26, 2024 POETRY Of poets poor, of poets richer PHILIP SPINK Groundcover vendor No. 630 I like the poetry of the poor, Often the most.

This will reduce recidivism. “In addition to all this, as sheriff, I will work with local and statewide partners to support enacting rent control to keep rent affordable, and will support more housing investments especially for people leaving our jail. My whole platform can be found at Dyer2024.com.” Jackson: (was unavailable to answer) Magee: “Being homeless is not a crime. Law enforcement is asked to respond to the issues the unhoused are victimized by — such as getting mugged or committing crime / being victim of a crime due to mental health concerns. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. But the Sheriff's Office wouldn’t [oversee it], but if [a community-led shelter] would reduce police calls, victimization and actual crime, then I agree to that.” On Defunding Law Enforcement Dyer: “Yes, I believe that diverting some funding from policing to community mental health care is essential. The Sheriff's Office currently receives $6-7 million annually from the Community Mental Health and Public Safety Millage, in addition to their already large budget. They used some of this money to buy rifles and upgrade their infrastructure. My goal is to use flexible funding to prioritize investments in mental health services, substance use treatment, housing and preventive measures. As a therapist, licensed social worker, and former police officer, I understand the importance of increasing access to mental health treatment. Police officers are not equipped to handle mental health crises, and expanding community mental health support and alternative responder programs will better serve our community's needs. This also allows law enforcement to focus on emergency 911 calls for service that need immediate attention for safety reasons. It shouldn’t be the case that in Wash-tenaw County people can’t get preventative mental health support. These gaps have real consequences on families and our whole community.” Jackson: (was not available to reply) Ken: [Long pause] \"I do not believe we should divert [police] funding to community mental health, but should provide training to officers to respond to mental health emergencies.” Magee believes that after taking away crime (that is caused by mental illness and acts of survival) there are still predators. “I believe we need a strong police presence to prevent crime,” Magee said. Magee is an advocate of restorative justice — with principles and limitations. He believes restorative justice should not apply to sex crimes and domestic violence.\n\n2 GROUNDCOVER NEWS OPINION JULY 12, 2024 Hear Me Out: the SCOTUS Grants Pass v. Johnson decision is a declaration of war People experiencing homelessness survive by sleeping in tents and alleys and bushes. Sleep and safe shelter are second to food and water, which means homeless people are literally barely hanging on to their lives. And now the United States Supreme Court has said it is okay to further punish people for trying to survive homelessness. In the case City of Grants Pass, Ore. v. Johnson, the Supreme Court was asked to determine if punishing homeless people for trespassing is cruel and unusual, per the U.S. Constitution. This June, they decided it is not: the Constitution does not protect the homeless from arrest or financial penalties — even though our economic JIM CLARK Groundcover vendor No. 139 and penal system put them there. Our lives as Americans are 100% built around and governed by our economic system. For those close to the bottom, the grind is getting some kind of job then entering an endless cycle of going to work and paying bills. The bills include some of the very things that support life — food and shelter specifically. Without these things, survival is impossible. The life-support things are commodified, so the only access you have to them is with money. Meaning if you don’t work in the system, you don’t get to live in the system. America is a pay-to-play country, and by play we mean survive. In America, you must be part of the economic system or you will die a slow death. Americans die every day from malnutrition, exposure to the elements, critical mental illnesses and from the violence of surviving on the street. And now, additionally, being homeless is a criminal act in America. The prevailing attitude towards people experiencing homelessness in our country is that it was their fault, due to some moral failing like “laziness,” and they could get out of their situation if they wanted to do so. The fact of the matter is, every homeless person I’ve met wants to get out of poverty. What people don’t realize is how hard that is in a capitalist system. In our system, one has to compete to survive. But the playing field is not even. To begin, most people need a cell phone and a car to get a job. Both cost money. You also need to be able to interview and prove you can make it to work. You also need to be clean see GRANTS PASS page 4  PROVIDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELFDETERMINED INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY POVERTY, PRODUCING A STREET NEWSPAPER THAT GIVES A PLATFORM TO UNDERREPRESENTED VOICES IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, PROMOTING AN ACTION TO BUILD A JUST, CARING AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY.
