The band was the brainchild of lead singer Mike Webber, and for a time included guitarist Kurt Schellenbach, Janus Jones on bass, and Nick Passiglia on drums, though the lineup at any given time was fluid. They played fast hardcore punk, often infused with humor and a total lack of political correctness. In addition to their own compositions, they recorded sometimes improbable covers of pop hits such as WE ARE ISIS Olivia Newton-John’s “Have You Never Been Mellow,” Duran Duran's \"Rio,\" and Sweet’s “Fox on the Run”. The last is heard on the soundtrack of the 1984 film Desperate Teenage Lovedolls. The band also made a cameo appearance in the 1985 film Echo Park starring Susan Dey and Tom Hulce.\n\nContents\n\nNip drivers rio bad trip elephant man tiki god\n\nNip drivers nip driver\n\nDiscography\n\nCompilation appearances\n\nSongs\n\nReferences\n\nAfter a period of inactivity, Webber emerged with an all-new line-up in the 1990s.
