        "text": "Marginal Man Double Image LP\n\nMaybe a tad slower than their debut album, this release retains MARGINAL MAN’s melodic approach to punk without losing too much of an edge. The vocals continue to snarl despite the melodic guitar and almost rock-structured songs. Controlled but not wimpy.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka / Enigma\n\nIssue MRR #27 • August 1985\n\nNecros Tangled Up / The Nile Song 7″\n\nMore of the muscle/hair punk rock that they approached on the Flipside comp. Doesn’t really bother me, but those who are rebelling against the NUGENT guitar riffs might want to stay clear. PINK FLOYD cover on the flip…hmmm.\n\nReviewer Dogtowne\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #33 • February 1986\n\nRedd Kross Teen Babes From Monsanto 12″\n\nSomewhat disappointing, especially after such a long wait for a REDD KROSS R’n’R fix. Mostly all covers (STONES, BOWIE, KISS, etc., etc.), the only real killer for me, the only composition with that ol’ RK pizazz, is the only original, “Linda Blair.” Hey guys, don’t wait so long for the next record—and get back in your groove. Pin-Ups this ain’t!\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #19 • November 1984\n\nThe F.U.’s Do We Really Want to Hurt You? LP\n\nDon’t let them fool you: beneath those goofy faces, beneath their copycat music (YOUTH BRIGADE), beneath their imitative cover (U.S. CHAOS), and beneath their lame lyrics (Alan King?), lies some real intelligence. How can I tell? Well, if you play this record backwards, you can barely make out the following: “Lone Live Proletarian Internationalism!” and “All Power to the Soviets!” I just knew they weren’t as lame as they acted.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #19 • November 1984\n\nV/A Flipside Vinyl Fanzine, Vol. 1 LP\n\nThere’s some first-rate American hardcore on this compilation, easily enough to compensate for an occasional so-so track. The FREEZE, BLACK MARKET BABY, KRAUT, GOVERNMENT ISSUE, and F.O.D. come across with some intense tracks, though my favorite may be the great live version of the DICKIES’ “Gigantor” that opens the album. I hope Volume Two of the series is as good.\n\nReviewer Steve Spinali\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #17 • September 1984\n\nV/A Desperate Teenage Lovedolls LP\n\nThe soundtrack to We Got Powers video extravaganza, there’s lots of great rock ’n’ roll. REDD KROSS appropriately dominates this disc, not only with their own tunes, but with members sitting in with WHITE FLAG as well. They are joined by BLACK FLAG, SIN 34 (WGPs “house band”), NIP DRIVERS, and DARKSIDE (?). Cool teen stuff!\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka / Enigma\n\nIssue MRR #20 • December 1984\n\nV/A Flipside Vinyl Fanzine, Vol. 2 LP\n\nWhile most of these tracks fall into the category of “good; but weak production,” you still get some pretty rippin’ tunes from MIA, DECRY, ROACH MOTEL, and DISORDERLY CONDUCT. The tracks from NAKED RAYGUN, OUTPATIENTS. and D.I. are very hot. Special live recordings from the MISFITS, JFA, and the GERMS. Cool poster included, too.\n\nReviewer Dogtowne\n\nLabel Flipside / Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #27 • August 1985\n\nV/A Flipside Tunes: Vinyl Fanzine Number Three LP\n\nBig names are on this effort (7 SECONDS, ADOLESCENTS, CIRCLE JERKS, the BRIGADE, M.I.A., S.N.F.U., DOGGY STYLE, TESCO VEE & WHITE FLAG, C.O.C.) as well as medium names (LITTLE GENTLEMEN, VATICAN COMMANDOS, MAD PARADE, SLAPSHOT, 76% UNCERTAIN, LEMONHEADS, SHONEN KNIFE) and the newer names (BULIMIA BANQUET, PROBLEM CHILDREN, COPULATION). Tunes are both live and studio, of varying sound quality. Interesting notes: what does it mean when the BRIGADE rocks more than 7 SECONDS?\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Flipside / Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #55 • December 1987\n\nWhite Flag S Is for Space LP\n\nThese guys might be punk’s answer to FRANK ZAPPA. The music ranges from garage punk to heavy metal to metal-punk to rock to thrash to experimental stuff to just plain ridiculousness, and is interspersed with talking, interviews, and blank space. This album is simultaneously imaginative, challenging, and dumb beyond belief.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #7 • July/August 1983\n\nWhite Flag Third Strike LP\n\nWhatever one might think of WHITE FLAG’s attitudes—and I think they’re about as infantile as they come—it can’t be denied that they’ve managed to put out another fine album. Like the first, this one combines lots of power, imagination, and humor (some of which is purely unintentional). Musically, there’s some fast stuff, some slower stuff, some metal, and some weird shit. The kind of record you can close your mind and happily march off a cliff to.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #20 • December 1984\n\nWhite Flag Zero Hour LP\n\nAnother good sounding LP, as these guys churn ’em out. Still have a problem with their so-called “anti-political” lyrics, which more often than not are a not-so-subtle acceptance of the conservative status quo. Musically, they maintain their zip and imagination, producing fine punk and thrash.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka / Starving Missile\n\nIssue MRR #38 • July 1986\n\nNecros / White Flag Jail Jello split 12″\n\nIf ever a bunch of guys deserved each other, it’s these geeks — WHITE FLAG and the NECROS (who split this disc). Nothing to do with supporting the AT defendants. Next…\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Gasatanka\n\nIssue MRR #45 • February 1987"
