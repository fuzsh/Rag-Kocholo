        "text": "The following texts have been written by a range of talented young scholars, artists and activists. We consider the first issue of the SSSCP Proceedings a great contribution to a wider body of research conducted within the field of cultural studies overall, but also to queer theory/politics/practice, gender studies, media and studies of the body. What differentiates this collection from others is a delicate balance between personal journeys and academic adventures that authors have taken upon. The first edition is also of invaluable importance and an immensely relevant input to a regional political and cultural struggle to embrace otherness. We would even go as far as to claim that the present collection represents a fresh and daring contribution to the inert regional academic production and a useful, empowering tool for various sorts of activist and artistic endeavors.

For many years I did not circulate this article after the accusations because I did not want to perpetuate a false narrative of his innocence or cultural significance. In response to a drop in women producing academic work following COVID-19, I decided to share this article. For one, it is out there, and it has been cited and read by students and academics. Second, in spite of the object of desire, this is looking at young women's sexuality and use of cyber-culture, an arena that needs to be taken up without punitive frameworks and as a way to better communicate the function of the internet on our individuation. Please contact me if you have any concerns or questions. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In her seminal work Hard Core (1999), Linda Williams ar- gues that pornography shows through its form a response and reaction to changing gender relations, reflecting a certain status and understanding of these relations in society. In this study, I discuss some ways women may be using pornography for their own purposes by looking at recent media discourses surround- ing the popularity of contemporary porn star James Deen and his supposed young women fans. I consider what is being said about women using pornography and how women are speaking about sex. When talking about porn, it is easy to believe that it is still mostly for men and about women. How pornographic content is being shared by Deen’s online fandom seems to demonstrate how this is a minimizing and erroneous assumption. By looking at on- line Deen fan sites and the interaction with the mainstream het- erosexual pornography genre in which he is situated, I discuss and compare related contemplations in current media of female sexu- ality and the expressions of female sexuality by his online fans. I concentrate on the socially communicated pleasure from women - supposedly younger women - who are connected to the online social media platform Tumblr. How are young women expressing their sexuality online and what are its possible greater implica- tions in regards to understanding pornography? How does Deen fit in all this and what does it mean that he is a polemical figure in porn? Deen has been called both a feminist hero and a sex- ist, pointing to his almost-romantic approach to sex-on-camera and his BDSM work as evidence of both positions. The discourses around Deen and his fandom point to the continuing anxiety sur- rounding female sexuality as well as the possibility of new consid- erations regarding its taboo.\n\nAbstract English: Xena: Warrior Princess - out of the Closet? A Melodramatic Response to the Show by Latin American and Spanish Lesbian & Gay Fans The research makes an analysis of the melodramatic interpretation of Xena: Warrior Princess (1995-2001) by latino gay and lesbian fans and of the obstacles that it brings about. The conflicts raised by its protagonists in the American series serve us in exploring the impact of a subtextual interpretation, and of a creative production from the latino fan communities within those of Xenaverse on the Internet. At the same time, I include the internal and external discourse (from those “in the know”) over the Production of the program. All of these factors serve to illustrate that the gender performance of Xena is lesbian and the performative character of gender is hidden within the patriarchal domination, socially reinforced and accepted in a hetero-hegemonic/sexist, homophobic and discriminatory culture. It is because of this that Xena will never be out of the closet, since she has never actually been in it. The difficulty is that these fans xenites are not always conscious of the homophobia that they are permanently exposed to, and this situation has to do with the social context that they are immersed in. Their melodramatic reading, the cultural component that defines them, causes some of the references to be lost from sight and in such cases the emotional prevails. Nevertheless, some fan actions and interactions are part of an original queer protest response to societies that oppress and subjugate."
