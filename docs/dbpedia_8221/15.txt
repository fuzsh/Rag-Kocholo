Phase One is a Danish company manufacturing high-end digital photography equipment and image processing software. Its main products are medium format camera systems and solutions based on it. Phase one is producing their own RAW processing and workflow software called Capture One. It is providing support for RAWs of many DSLRs and Phase One and Leaf digital backs. Currently, it is not supporting files from other medium format digital back manufacturers.

Phase one is organizing each year series of photography workshops designed for digital photographers interested in working with high-end and high-resolution medium format camera and are calling them PODAS workshops /Phase One Digital Artist Series/. PODAS are part of the Phase One educational provided to its users and each person attending these workshops is given a Phase One digital back plus a camera for the duration of the workshop.

Cameras

Phase One purchased a major stake in Japanese camera and lens manufacturer Mamiya in 2009, and since then the two companies develop products together.

Phase One 645XF

Phase One 645DF+

Phase One 645DF (discontinued)

Phase One 645AF (discontinued)

Phase One iXA (aerial)

Phase One iXR (reproduction)

Phase One iXU (aerial, surveillance and UAV operations)

The Phase One XF, 645DF+ and 645DF are high-end medium format cameras which support both focal plane and leaf shutter lenses with shutter speeds ranging from 1/4000s to 60 minutes and flash synchronization up to 1/1600 sec with leaf shutter lenses. Some features on the 645DF+ are:

Accurate and fast autofocus even in low contrast scenes

Custom focus fine-tuning adjustment

Rechargeable Li-ion battery which providing ability of making up to 10000 photos

Rugged design and construction for professional use

The Phase One V-Grip Air vertical grip is compatible with the 645DF+/645DF. The V-Grip Air supports a Profoto Air flash trigger for wireless flash synchronization.

The 645DF+/645DF supports digital back interfaces including the IQ and P+ series digital backs as well as 3rd party digital backs from Hasselblad, Leaf, and others.

In 2012, Phase One released two specialty cameras: iXR which is made specifically for reproduction and iXA which is made specifically for aerial photography. Both uses the 645 lenses as the normal 645 cameras. The main difference on this camera is they have no viewfinder and very few mechanical moving parts.

In 2013, Phase One signed a collaborative distribution agreement with Digital Transitions (DT) to deliver advanced digitization solutions for cultural heritage preservation imaging projects worldwide (Repro camera solutions). This digitization equipment includes a multitude of reprographic equipment and camera stands, specialized stations for book copying, film scanning kits, and various accessories that are used for Phase One digital capture hardware and Capture One software.

In 2014, Phase One launched a medium format digital back with a CMOS/Active pixel sensor: The IQ250. All Phase One digital backs launched prior to the IQ250 have sensors based on the CCD (Charge-coupled device) technology.

The P+ series are very similar to the normal P-series digital backs but have higher capture frame rate, better response to long exposure photos, and add Live Preview during tethered use. Also, a new high-resolution LCD screen was implemented with better resolution and luminance.

Digital Backs P+ Series list

Digital Backs P Series

The Phase One P-series digital backs are self sustained units available for many different camera mounts.

Digital Backs H Series

The Phase One H-series digital backs are tethered units available for various camera mounts. Digital bacsk connects to computer via standard 6pin IEEE 1394. These series of digital backs were originally released as the “Lightphase”, a continuation of Phase One’s tradition of using the name “phase” in the name of their product. This changed with the release of the “H20″, which was originally called “Lightphase H20″ but the name was changed to “Phase One H20″ for better brand recognition.

Scan Backs

Phase One Scan backs are fully tethered digital scan backs. They are using SCSI connection to connect to computer except for PowerPhase FX, which is using IEEE1394 “firewire”. Early models of Phase One scan backs CB6x StudioKit and FC70 PhotoPhase, have external control unit that connected to a computer through NuBus.

Repro camera solutions
