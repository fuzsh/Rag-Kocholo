        "text": "SP-104 is a novel, proprietary, fixed dose, delayed burst release of low dose naltrexone hydrochloride, 4.5 mg, for treatment of fibromyalgia (FM).\n\nThere is a clear medical need for new, safe and effective treatments with the potential to improve care for the estimated 10 million FM patients in the U.S. and more than 200 million worldwide\n\nPhase 1 clinical trial data showed that SP-104 treated healthy volunteers and had lower rates of adverse events, as compared with immediate release naltrexone -treated volunteers.\n\nPALO ALTO and SAN DIEGO, CA. May 11, 2022 /Newswire/ –– Scilex Holding Company (“Scilex”), a Sorrento Company (nearly 100% or over 99.9% majority-owned subsidiary of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.) (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) and a commercial biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing non-opioid therapies for patients with acute and chronic pain, announced today that safety data from Scilex’s Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that SP-104 was better tolerated than immediate release naltrexone hydrochloride 4.5 mg at the same dose in healthy volunteers. A second Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trial has completed enrollment and results will be available soon.\n\nSP-104 is a novel, proprietary, fixed dose, delayed burst release of low dose naltrexone, for the treatment of FM and has an end goal of reducing side effects associated with formulations of immediate release naltrexone and FM disease burden. SP-104 has key clinical data supporting its use in the treatment of FM. Prior investigational trials support the use and development of SP-104, delayed burst release naltrexone hydrochloride 4.5 mg, for FM. Currently there are no low-dose formulations (i.e., less than 5 mg) available. Physicians currently use the commercially available high-dose tablets (naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg) and have compounding pharmacies aliquot lower doses for patients. Pharmacy-compounding is inherently inaccurate and does not involve analyses to confirm that the aliquoted product has the target level of drug, and there is no assurance as to content uniformity within a batch as well as other quality attributes critical for pharmaceutical product performance. This can lead to errors in dosing and challenges with titration. The commercial products and pharmacy-compounded products also allow for the immediate release of the drug in the stomach, which can lead to compliance challenges due to severe side effects. Common side effects for naltrexone include hyperalgesia, dysphoria, insomnia and anxiety. All these issues culminate into patient compliance issues and result in the eventual abandonment of an otherwise viable therapy to treat this debilitating disease. SP-104 uses delayed burst release technology that bypasses the stomach and releases the drug in the gut (upper intestine). When taking SP-104 at night before bed, peak drug levels are achieved at night during sleep, allowing the patient to avoid conscious perception of hyperalgesia and other side effects. The combination of the delayed-release and administration at night may also maximize efficacy as most endorphin/enkephalin release is during sleep, which maximizes the product’s potential to elicit compensatory response.\n\nScilex is committed to develop SP-104 for FM. Phase 1 studies are to characterize the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of SP-104, and Scilex intends to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2022. If successful, we believe SP-104 can become a pivotal treatment for management of FM, which represents a large commercial opportunity with high unmet needs. “There is a clear medical need for new, safe and effective treatments with the potential to improve care for the estimated 10 million FM patients in the U.S. and more than 200 million worldwide,” commented Dmitri Lissin, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Scilex. “Our Phase 1 clinical trial data demonstrated that healthy volunteers treated with SP-104 had lower rates of adverse events, as compared with immediate release naltrexone -treated volunteers. This is an especially encouraging result when viewed in the background of the large number of current FM patients and high provider dissatisfaction with the few existing approved FM treatments”.\n\nScilex Holding Company and Vickers Vantage Corp. I (Nasdaq: VCKA) (“VCKA”), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Vickers Venture Fund VI Pte Ltd and Vickers Venture Fund VI (Plan) Pte Ltd, entered into a definitive business combination agreement (“BCA”) on March 17, 2022. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company (the “Combined Company”) will be renamed Scilex Holding Company, and its common stock is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SCLX”. The boards of directors of each of VCKA, Scilex and Sorrento have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2022, is subject to the approval of VCKA’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions.\n\nA corporate presentation describing Scilex’s development plans can be found at www.scilexholding.com.\n\nAbout Scilex Holding Company\n\nScilex Holding Company, a Sorrento Company (nearly 100% or over 99.9% majority-owned subsidiary of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.), is dedicated to the development and commercialization of non-opioid pain management products for treatment of acute and chronic pain.
