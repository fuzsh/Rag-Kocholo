        "text": "This press releaseÂ was updated on October 2, 2023. Specifically, two data points have been updated after it was discovered that the data point from the Hauser diary OFF time in the low dose cohort and the data point from the MDS-UPDRS Part III low dose cohort inadvertently described âmeanâ data from the study rather than âmedianâ data. The overall assessment of the exploratory clinical endpoints as originally reported is unchanged by these updates. See footnotes for the original text.\n\nInvestigational cellular therapy, bemdaneprocel (BRT-DA01), was well tolerated with no major safety issues in all 12 participants in low dose and high dose cohorts through one year\n\nAt one-year, exploratory clinical endpoints improved overall, with participants in the high dose cohort showing greater improvement.\n\nOne year assessment of all participants demonstrated feasibility of transplantation, cell survival, and engraftment\n\nPlanning is underway for a Phase II study that is expected to begin enrolling participants in H1 (first half) 2024\n\nBerlin, Germany, Cambridge, MA USA, August 28, 2023 â Bayer AG and BlueRock Therapeutics LP, a clinical stage cell therapy company and wholly owned independently operated subsidiary of Bayer AG, announced today details of the positive data from the Phase I clinical trial for bemdaneprocel (BRT-DA01), a stem cell derived investigational therapy for treating Parkinsonâs disease. The data were presented at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement DisordersÂ® in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nThe study met the primary objective of demonstrating safety and tolerability in all 12 participants in the studyâs low and high dose cohorts, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported related to bemdaneprocel through one year. There were two SAEs reported that were unrelated to bemdaneprocel, one seizure attributed to the surgical procedure and one COVID case. Both resolved without sequelae. In addition, 18F-DOPA PET imaging scans demonstrated evidence of cell survival and engraftment in both low and high dose cohorts. 18F-DOPA PET imaging is a neuroradiological technique used to visualize and assess dopaminergic activity in Parkinsonâs disease.\n\nSecondary exploratory clinical endpoints improved in both cohorts, with participants in the high dose cohort showing greater improvement, as assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinsonâs Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS Part III) and the Hauser Diary, which are tools used to assess Parkinsonâs disease severity in motor symptoms.\n\nâThe data from this Phase I open label study are extremely encouragingâ said Claire Henchcliffe, MD, chair of the UCI School of Medicine Department of Neurology at the University of California, Irvine and one of the studyâs Principal Investigators.â¯âWhile this is a small open-label study,â¯meeting the studyâs primary objective for safety and tolerability along with initialâ¯improvements seen in clinical outcomes represents a great step forward. The hope now is that these trends continue and translate into meaningful benefit for people with Parkinsonâs disease in controlled clinical trials.â\n\nUsing the Hauser Diary, which categorizes patients as being in the âONâ state when their symptoms are well controlled and in the âOFFâ state when they experience a worsening of their symptoms, participants in the high dose cohort showed a median improvement of 2.16 hours in time spent in the âONâ state without troubling dyskinesia compared with baseline after one year. Time spent in the âOFFâ state showed a corresponding median decrease of 1.91 hours after one year. Participants in the low dose cohort showed a median improvement of 0.72 hours in the âONâ state without troubling dyskinesia time compared with baseline and a corresponding median decrease of 1.62 hours in âOFFâ state time.1\n\nIn the high dose cohort, a one-year measurement of the effects of bemdaneprocel using MDS-UPDRS Part III measured in the âOFFâ-medication state, showed a median reduction of 13.0 points compared with baseline. The low dose cohort showed a median increase of 1 point.2\n\nâThe need for new therapies to help patients struggling with Parkinsonâs disease is clear,â said Ahmed Enayetallah, Senior Vice President and Head of Development, BlueRock Therapeutics. âWe are excited to be sharing the results of this Phase I and look forward to advancing bemdaneprocel to the next stage of clinical testing.â\n\nBased on these results, planning is underway for a Phase II study that is expected to begin enrolling patients in H1 (first half) 2024.\n\nâThe standard of care for millions of people living with Parkinsonâs disease has only marginally improved in the past decades, and the existing unmet medical need will only become higher due to the growing aging populationâ, said Christian Rommel, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayerâs Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. âThe positive outcome of this Phase I clinical trial is a clear step forward, and it brings us closer to delivering new treatment options to patientsâ.\n\nAbout bemdaneprocel (BRT-DA01) and the Phase I Trial\n\nBemdaneprocel (BRT-DA01) is an investigational cell therapy designed to replace the dopamine producing neurons that are lost in Parkinsonâs disease. These dopaminergic neuron precursors are derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) that are human embryonic stem cells. In a surgical procedure, these neuron precursors are implanted into the brain of a person with Parkinsonâs disease. When transplanted, they have the potential to reform neural networks that have been severely affected by Parkinsonâs and restore motor and non-motor function to patients.\n\nThis phase I study is a multi-center, multi-site, open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled study. Twelve (12) subjects received surgical transplantation of 1 of 2 different dose levels of bemdaneprocel cells to the post-commissural putamen bilaterally, and administration of a 1-year immunosuppression regimen. Cohort A (5 subjects) received a dose of 0.9 million cells per putamen. Cohort B (7 subjects) received 2.7 million cells per putamen. Safety and tolerability were assessed at 1 year, along with evidence of cell survival and motor effects. The feasibility of transplantation was also assessed. All assessments will continue over 2 years.\n\nThe transplant surgeries were performed by Dr. Viviane Tabar, MD, Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center and Dr. Andres Lozano, M.D., Ph.D., F.R.C.S.C., F.R.S.C., F.C.A.H.S., Neurosurgeon and Senior Scientist, Krembil Brain Institute, University Health Network (UHN), Alan & Susan Hudson Cornerstone Chair in Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network and Chairman of the Division of Neurosurgery at the University of Toronto (UoT). Participants were followed at clinical sites by Dr. Harini Sarva, M.D. at Weill Cornell Medicine, Dr. Claire Henchcliffe, M.D., D.Phil., F.A.A.N., F.A.N.A. at the University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Alfonso Fasano, M.D., PhD., Chair in Neuromodulation and Multi-Disciplinary Care at the University Health Network (UHN) and UoT.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering (MSK): Dr. Tabar has financial interests related to BlueRock. MSK has institutional financial interests related to BlueRock. Note the foregoing institutional disclosure language is included because the referenced study relates to MSK technology licensed to BlueRock.\n\nUniversity Health Network (UHN): UHN has institutional financial interests related to BlueRock.\n\nMore information about the Phase I trial is available at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04802733).\n\nAbout Parkinsonâs disease\n\nParkinsonâs disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain, leading to decreased dopamine levels. At diagnosis, it is estimated that patients have already lost 50-80% of their dopaminergic neurons. The loss of these neurons leads to a progressive loss of motor function and symptoms such as tremors, muscle rigidity, and slowness of movement. Even with medication, the symptoms of Parkinsonâs disease can fluctuate during the course of the day. According to the Parkinsonâs Foundation, more than 10 million people worldwide suffer from Parkinsonâs disease, with approximately one million living in the United States. There is no cure and the effectiveness of current treatments decreases over time.\n\nAbout BlueRock Therapeutics LP\n\nBlueRock Therapeutics LP is a clinical stage cell therapy company focused on creating cellular medicines to reverse devastating diseases.
