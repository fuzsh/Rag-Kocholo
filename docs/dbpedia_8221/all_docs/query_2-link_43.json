        "text": "Phase One Industrial, a leading manufacturer and provider of medium format aerial digital photography equipment and software solutions, today introduced the iXU-R camera series. Available in 80 MP, 60MP and 60MP achromatic versions, these cameras feature dedicated interchangeable 40 mm, 50 mm and 70 mm Phase One Rodenstock lenses equipped with central leaf shutters that can be quickly changed in the field. They offer unprecedented flexibility in aerial applications.\n\nThe Phase One iXU-R systems have been designed to address the aerial data acquisition market’s needs for a small, lightweight camera with the high resolution of a medium format system, plus high performance optics, flexibility to fit into small places and Phase One’s fastest 80 MP platform. For example, the iXU-R 180 is built around a large 80-megapixel sensor, with 10,328 pixels cross-track coverage yet it is compact enough to be easily integrated into a small gimbal or pod space or an oblique/nadir array. Or it can be used as a standalone photogrammetric camera with optional Forward Motion Compensation.\n\nCameras are easily integrated into new or existing setups with USB 3.0 connectivity for control and storage via the Phase One iX Capture application. All Phase One aerial cameras offer direct communication with GPS/IMU systems and the ability to directly write data to the image files. For more details about the cameras introduced today please go to: http://industrial.phaseone. com/iXU-R_camera_system.aspx.\n\n“As the use of UAVs and small aircraft increases dramatically around the world, and every gram in a payload counts, Phase One Industrial is committed to offering small and lightweight cameras without sacrificing data accuracy, image quality and resolution,” said Dov Kalinski, General Manager of Phase One Industrial. “With this announcement, Phase One Industrial has established itself as the clear leader in digital medium format aerial cameras, with its range of 13 unique camera systems optimized for all aerial data acquisition projects.”\n\nAvailability\n\nAll Phase One iXU-R systems are available now from authorized Phase One Industrial partners.
