First there isn't going to be any perceptive difference in color or saturation because of the film camera. Perhaps slight differences in color balance and contrast because of lens but both systems had superb optics. If your seeing that it is related mostly to the film used and perhaps the processing. They are quite different camera with the Mamiya C220 twin reflex being a great camera for portraits and landscape but has a very limited lens selection. It's bigger brother the C330 which is really bulky was more to the liking of professional photographers (I own that also). The Pentax being a complete SLR system with a wide range of lens is a much more usable camera for all purposes. The lens are superb and in most cases are available at low cost through ebay and keh.com. If those are your 2 choices the features of the 645N would make it my choice hands down.\n\nDave\n\nEdited on Dec 04, 2010 at 05:40 PM · View previous versions\n\nphotosmart42\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #3 · p.1 #3 · MediumF: Mamiya C220 or Pentax 645N\n\nOne issue to consider is the film format you're after. The TLR shoots in 6x6 format, so it's a larger image than the one you'd get from the SLR, which is 6x4.5. They're also completely different shooting styles. The TLR is a heads-down shooting style, looking through the upper lens and shooting through the lower lens, which comes with its own issues (especially in close-up photography where parallax can be an issue with TLR/RF-style cameras). The Pentax is more of a traditional through-the-lens shooting style that you hold up to your eye, which also makes it more conspicuous so not very good at shooting in crowds without causing a stir. The TLR also has the shutter on the lens and no mirror, making it very quite and stable, whereas the SLR has the traditional mirror that can be much louder, especially on a MF camera.\n\nWhen looking at how 'vivid' the colors look, you'll have to consider the film people used in the sample images. There's a large amount of variation in different films, some being more 'vivid' than others. Don't automatically assume it's a lens characteristic.\n\nJohnJ\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · MediumF: Mamiya C220 or Pentax 645N\n\nOP, what do you want to shoot? This matters more than anything else in choosing a camera because the 2 you've mentioned are quite different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nphotosmart42 wrote:\n\nOne issue to consider is the film format you're after.

It's harmless and doesn't cause a stir as would most other cameras. I love this aspect of the C220, although I hardly ever use mine any more. The C220 is a brilliant camera, maybe my favourite.\n\nYou can crop 6x6 into 6x4.5 without loosing quality but it doesn't work the other way around.\n\nDifferences in colour probably have more to do with film/scanning, PP rather than the camera/lens so I would not place much importance on that factor. The Mamiya lenses are 'likely' (I'm not certain) to be less contrasty then the more modern Pentax which is likely to have better coatings.\n\nConsider what you want to shoot and that will tell you which camera to buy.\n\nThe TLR is brilliant for some things, but poor for others. Overall the Pentax is probably the most practical, but that's obviously dependent on your intended application.\n\nJJ\n\nJohnJ\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · MediumF: Mamiya C220 or Pentax 645N\n\ntukhang wrote:\n\n... I prefer my pictures to look just right in term of white balance and colour accuracy, I dont really like the \"tin-ish\" look, little bit is ok, but not so much...\n\nYou're in for a rude shock. It's very difficult to get accurate white balance with film, even for experienced shooters. I shot cars for magazines with E6 film for many years, at sunrise/set, overcast, indoors, in shadows and all kinds of lighting, and colour accuracy/balance was always difficult. I hardly ever shot in plain old daylight which would have been much easier. This is so easy now with digital and RAW files where all of this is set after the fact.\n\nIf you shoot slide film/E6 (and you want the correct balance on the film) then you have to get it right when you press the shutter release. This requires a range of colour correcting filters, from 81A through to 85C, and probably some green and magenta filtration too. You might need a colour temp meter too and the time to understand what it is telling you and how to relate this to a filter (by which time the light has probably changed anyway). Shooting C41 lets you off the hook to an extent.\n\nI'm assuming you won't actually be printing the film so you will have to scan the film, which leaves you all the same issues as having shot it digitally in the first place, but with heaps more dust to contend with.\n\nI think medium format film 'seems' like a great idea but the reality is not what it seems. If you intend to print the film (ie in a darkroom, all analog, no digital) then that's another story. But once you start scanning then you are better off shooting digital in the first place. IMHO.\n\nJJ\n\nmelcat\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #8 · p.1 #8 · MediumF: Mamiya C220 or Pentax 645N\n\nI had the Mamiya C330 for a while, also with the intention of shooting landscapes.\n\nIf you go this way, look up and understand \"leaf shutter efficiency\". This can be adjusted for with electronic shutters, but the Mamiya ones were mechanical and there was no attempt to correct for it in the mechanism. Independent of this problem, but making it even harder for a novice to counter it, the leaf shutters require periodic adjustment. This is expensive and there's a shutter per lens.\n\nIn their heyday, these cameras were typically used for posed portraits and group shots. The tripod and subject were set at a fixed distance, the settings were usually canned, and it was black and white negative film, which in those days was very forgiving of poor exposure. I remember as a small child, in the 1960s, a photographer using a TLR to take our class photo. He had a big spooled tape measure and some chalk, and set his tripod a fixed distance from the seats. He probably had a mark on the bellows mechanism and owned a single lens. This was probably a C220, as they were standard for the job.\n\nSo yes, it is a \"professional\" camera, but, as is often the case, as an amateur you need a more sophisticated tool.\n\nJohnJ is dead right about film. The scanning will get you, and unless you get an expensive medium format scanner, you'll be doing it on a flatbed, which is a new world of pain. That was why I went back to 35mm film. It was the colour temperature/accuracy issue that pushed me to digital - even though you could get away with fewer corrections for landscape than would be acceptable for car photography.\n\nEDIT - Bob Monaghan's page on the camera appears to be back on line:\n\nhttp://medfmt.8k.com/mf/mamiyac220.html\n\nThis may be the source of the Internet meme that it's a good medium format camera for amateurs. IMO it is not unless you're doing posed studio work and have deep pockets for the shutter services.\n\nsirimiri\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #12 · p.1 #12 · MediumF: Mamiya C220 or Pentax 645N\n\nYou might also consider shooting some black and while films with either of the MF cameras you pick up. Once you \"regress\" from color to B+W, it becomes more a thing of overall tonality. B/W still does this as well as it always did. I don't do much HDR nor use/own Silver EFX, but a well-scanned B+W negative has lots and lots of editing potential.\n\nI use a 645NII - it's noisy, clunky and ugly but has great battery life, great AF for what it is, and the UI is simple, the camera stays out of your way.\n\nIf I were to advise on which camera you should get, I must say the Penax 645 FA 150mm lens is really fantastic for portraits. The autofocus (FA) lenses were practically free a few years ago, but with the Pentax 645D coming out, they are harder to find. In any event, I think your easiset transition from a dSLR would be with the Pentax.\n\nSo, if the 645N is on the table, and you can't step up to a 645NII, \"go for it\" says I."
