        "text": "If you wonder what is the new Scientific Imaging by Phase One iXH #100MP suitable for, think about #film #digitization, especially small format, like 35mm strips, 120 or mounted slides. The smaller sensor (compared to the iXH #150MP) allows for a slightly higher magnification ratio. In non-nerdy terms it means that you can get a tighter crop and use a larger part of the sensor when digitizing the same object. These are 2 examples I had created during testing. The B&W image of the old train engine is a #6x6 negative, done with both cameras at 3,600ppi (same distance and same extension tube configuration, with the #120mm lens). The color image of the more modern engine is a #35mm negative strip, done with both cameras at 6,600ppi (again same distance and same tubes) In both examples, you can see how the object fills up more of the image frame. You are making a more efficient use of the system and this is achieved at a lower price point! The 3rd image, of an old copper print, was done with the goal of using similar magnification knowing that the capture #resolution is little lower. The 150MP was done at 2,000ppi while the 100MP was taken at 1,600ppi, both the the #72mm MkII lens. The framing is very similar however since the 100MP needs to be set a little higher, we benefit from a slightly larger Depth Of Field, which, for certain objects, such as #books with curved pages, is an advantage, as we can maintain sharpness across larger parts of the image area. So if your work projects and collections include mostly medium and small-ish scale objects, and if you do not need to do A0+ at 300ppi regularly, you may consider going for the iXH 100MP. You get the exact same image quality, efficiency and reliability, with the same workflow and features (AutoPPI, USB-c/ Ethernet connectivity, accurate focusing, full 16-bit RAW files, low noise etc.), and you pay a little less for it! What's not to like??? Any questions? Just reach out!"
