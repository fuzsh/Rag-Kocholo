We aim to offer the world’s widest range of medium format lenses for Mamiya and Phase One camera platforms.”\n\nAbout Mamiya Digital Imaging\n\nMamiya Digital Imaging is the digital successor to the reputable Mamiya brand, an innovative company fresh with enthusiasm and dedicated to continuing a legacy of excellence.
