        "text": "In the wake of Japan's third-largest corporate bankruptcy in the postwar years, Government and central bank officials are trying to arrange emergency loans to prevent a chain of business failures that could threaten hundreds of smaller companies employing thousands of workers.\n\nLast Wednesday, J. Osawa & Company, a trading concern, filed for court protection. Osawa had liabilities totaling more than $530 million, at the current exchange rate of 226 yen to the American dollar.\n\nOsawa has been the sole overseas distributor for Mamiya-brand cameras, widely used by professional photographers. Today, the Mamiya Camera Company also filed for bankruptcy, declaring liabilities of $110 million. Osawa had a 10 percent stake in Mamiya.\n\nEmbroiled in the case, too, is the Cosmo 80 Company, a high-flying computer software concern. Cosmo 80, a private company, reportedly had $13 million invested in Mamiya. ''We have suffered a lot from this,'' said Masaru Usui, president.\n\nPartner in Software\n\nCosmo 80 is a partner in software development ventures with such major companies as the Japanese subsidiary of the International Business Machines Corporation and the Mitsubishi Corporation.\n\nThe Osawa failure could affect as many as 500 companies, mostly affiliates, subcontractors and partners of Osawa and Mamiya. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Bank of Japan are directing banks and other lenders to extend credit to the affected companies, trying to avoid further bankruptcies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
