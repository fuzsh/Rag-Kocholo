        "text": "Virginia Governor Ralph Northam addressed the commonwealth on Friday for his latest briefing on Virginia's response to COVID-19, providing details on Phase 1 of his 'Forward Virginia' plan.\n\nAt his\n\n, as the governor discussed Virginia's efforts to increase testing across the commonwealth, he said he and his coronavirus response team would be providing specific plans for businesses and outlining specific restrictions that will continue as Virginia moves into Phase 1 of reopening.\n\nOn Monday, he\n\nand announced that he expects it to begin on May 15.\n\nNow, one week away from that May 15 goal set by Northam, he will be following up with a lot more detail on his \"Forward Virginia\" blueprint for reopening the commonwealth, including specifics on Phase 1, business guidelines, and how to keep consumers comfortable when they enter businesses.\n\nThe governor also said on Wednesday that the restrictions in Phase 1 established by his administration will be \"the floor\" and that local governments around the state can implement more severe limits if they determine it's needed based on their case counts, as well as hospital and PPE capacity.\n\nAs of May 8, Virginia\n\n, including confirmed lab tests and clinical diagnoses, with 812 total deaths and 3,059 cumulative hospitalizations.\n\nAccording to the\n\n, there are currently 1,625 Virginians hospitalized with either confirmed COVID-19 tests or pending COVID-19 test results.\n\nThe past few days of test results have yielded lower daily case totals, even with increased testing, which means the \"curve\" of cases in Virginia has begun to flatten.\n\nThe commonwealth is still working to overcome an earlier backlog in testing and catch up to the national average of how much of the population has been tested.\n\nYou can watch each of the governor's briefings through WHSV's livestream at\n\nor on the WHSV News app. That livestream can also be watched through our Roku and Amazon Fire apps. You'll also be able to watch it live in the video player above during the briefing.\n\nThe latest updates from Gov. Northam's May 8 briefing\n\nAs he has done at the past several briefings, Governor Ralph Northam began Friday's briefing by recapping where the commonwealth has been â€“ starting with the first confirmed COVID-19 case just over a month ago on March 7.\n\nThe governor said at the start of dealing with the pandemic, he all governors across the U.S. had \"one blunt tool\" to confront the crisis, which was \"shutting everything down.\"\n\nHe provided a brief overview of the actions taken throughout Virginia's response, including directing everyone to stay home except for essential reasons, because he said the only way to slow the spread of the virus was and still is to stay apart, with business closures designed for the same reason.\n\n\"And it's worked,\" Northam said, pointing to Virginia's latest data, which shows that hospitals have not been overwhelmed, that Virginia has a steady supply of PPE with no hospitals reporting any supply problems now, and the percentage of Virginians testing positive now trending downward.\n\nThe governor said Virginia is also continuing to work to ramp up testing across Virginia. Friday's numbers indicated more than 6,000 tests over the past day, and Dr. Karen Remley, who heads up Virginia's testing task force, said on Friday that they're working with local officials around Virginia to increase the daily test number to around 10,000 tests a day by the end of next week.\n\nNortham cited an example that officials will be testing about 1,500 people on the Eastern Shore this weekend around the locations of outbreaks at poultry plants there.\n\nHe also highlighted the Virginia Department of Health's ongoing effort to hire 1,000 more contact tracers across all health districts in the state, and said that Virginia currently has about 325. Previously, Dr. Norm Oliver, the state health commissioner, had said they could not identify the exact current number because all tracers are employed at local health district levels.\n\nGov. Northam said, so long as the current trends in Virginia's COVID-19 data continue, he believes we're set to start Phase 1 of reopening on Friday, May 15.\n\nHowever, he did emphasize that if those trends change, that date can be adjusted if needed.\n\n\"While our tools to fight this virus have changed, our commitment has not,\" Northam said.\n\nHe said beginning Phase 1 will not be \"opening the floodgates\" or \"flipping a light switch\" but instead used the analogy of turning a dimmer switch up just a notch to gradually begin reopening Virginia.\n\nNortham said the date of May 15, so long as data trends continue, will begin a three-phase process for Virginia and restrictions will continue because the virus is still in nearly every community.\n\nScience, data, and safety, Northam said, will be his criteria to move Virginia forward.\n\nThe governor showcased a variety of charts and graphs to present the data metrics he said he and his staff are relying on to determine when and how Virginia moves forward. He said those will later be available on the state website at\n\n.\n\nSpecifically, Northam showed Virginia's 7-day moving average of new cases, which is steadily dipping; the 7-day average of tests being performed, which is trending upward; the rate of Virginians who are tested that test positive, which is trending downward; PPE supply difficulties at hospitals, which have dropped to zero; hospital bed capacity and surge capacity, which have remained steady; and hospitalization numbers for COVID-19 patients, which have remained essentially flat.\n\nThe rate at which cases have doubled in Virginia has also slowed over time, down to 16 days now.\n\nGov. Northam did say that they are keeping an eye on the hospital capacity numbers as elective procedures resume across the commonwealth to see if that steady rate changes.\n\nThe specifics of Phase 1\n\nAccording to Gov. Northam's Friday presentation, the overarching guidance for Phase 1 involves the Stay at Home order switching to a Safer at Home order, which means Virginians should still stay home when possible, and that Virginians who are vulnerable, like the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, need to continue saying at home except for essential reasons.\n\nThe 10-person gathering limit established in Executive Order 53 will remain in place for any public gatherings â€“ though it does not apply to all gatherings within specific businesses, as outlined below.\n\nFace masks are heavily encouraged in public, social distancing is still required, and the state still strongly suggests continued teleworking if possible.\n\nWhen it comes to industries, there is specific guidance on how limitations are being eased, which is broken down below:\n\nâ€“ have been open with a 10-person limit and in Phase 1 can open to a maximum of 50% of their store's customer capacity.\n\nâ€“ have been open for takeout and delivery and in Phase 1 can open up outdoor seating at 50% capacity\n\nWhen asked why restaurants cannot open their doors to in-house dining yet, while non-essential retail stores can open their doors to more customers, Gov. Northam said the decision was made based on a \"tremendous amount\" of discussion with restaurant owners and that it was their collective decision that outdoor seating, for now, would be in the best interest of customers and employees.\n\nNortham said if data keeps trending downward, and Phase 2 can be entered in hopefully two weeks, restaurants will be allowed to open dine-in eating in Phase 2, with 50% capacity and social distancing between tables.\n\nâ€“ have been closed and in Phase 1 will remain closed\n\nâ€“ have been closed and in Phase 1 will be able to hold outdoor classes with social distancing\n\n'\n\nâ€“ have remained open only for exercise and fishing and in Phase 1 will continue to be open only for those reasons\n\nThe governor said when asked about beaches later in the press conference that the state government is working with localities like Virginia Beach, letting each locality focus on their own comprehensive plans to make sure their beaches are ready before a decision is to made to open them further.\n\nThe bottom line, Northam said, is that people need to feel comfortable when they go to a beach, grabbing handrails, standing on the boardwalk, etc., that they won't contract the virus.\n\nHe said there's no date yet on when they'll open up to more than exercise and fishing, but it won't be when Phase 1 starts.\n\n- have been able to hold drive-in services and small services with fewer than 10 people and in Phase 1 will be able to hold services inside with 50% of the building's capacity while drive-in services remain allowed\n\nâ€“ have been closed and in Phase 1 can open by appointment only, with strict social distancing in place and face masks required\n\nâ€“ have been closed and in Phase 1 can open, with restrictions on distance between campsites\n\nâ€“ have been open for day use only and in Phase 1 will open up to overnight camping in gradual regional phases. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation issued an update shortly after the governor's briefing\n\n.\n\nâ€“ have been open for working families and in Phase 1 can continue that way\n\nâ€“ will remain closed in Phase 1\n\nAll of Virginia's guidelines will be posted on the Virginia state website.\n\nGov. Northam said Phase 1 will last a minimum of two weeks, but may last longer depending on what the data on health metrics shows as we move forward.\n\nThe governor said some communities may enter Phase 1 more slowly than others, but those decisions will have to be made by local governments coordinating for an overall region, like northern Virginia, which is not seeing quite the same declines in cases that the rest of the state is seeing.\n\nAccording to Northam's chief of staff, they have spoken with localities in northern Virginia, including Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax counties, which he said have each expressed interest in possibly delaying entering Phase 1 so that they can meet the criteria the rest of the state is meeting for Phase 1.\n\nBut local officials who may plan to do that are in coordination with the state government to determine if they should delay entering Phase 1.\n\nBut the state government only plans to allow moves like that on regional levels â€“ not individual cities or counties.\n\nNortham said Phase 1 means that businesses may reopen, but not that they are required to reopen. If a business cannot meet the guidelines of Phase 1, he said they should not reopen yet.\n\nAny economic recovery, Northam said, will be consumer-driven, and he encouraged businesses to take all precautions possible to protect everyone, including their employees.\n\nGov. Northam said the restrictions of Phase 1 will be enforced like Executive Order 53 has been enforced so far, with local law enforcement and Virginia State Police holding the authority to cite people who do not obey the guidelines.\n\nHowever, the goal, Northam said, is not to cite people but to protect Virginians.\n\nIf there were to be a new surge in cases of COVID-19 across Virginia or a second wave, the governor said previous restrictions can be put in place if need-be because it 's a dynamic, fluid process, with data changing every day.\n\nHowever, Northam said the entire goal of the restrictions in Phase 1 is to prevent a situation like that.\n\nBut if numbers go in a direction that the administration is not comfortable with, based on the same metrics being followed now, like hospital capacity, PPE supplies, and case trends, they will move restrictions back as needed.\n\nGovernor Northam said if any workers are afraid to return, even if their business reopens, because they or a loved one has an underlying condition, his administration is developing ways to protect them.\n\nHe said restrictions are meant to protect workers as much as customers and that his administration is asking Virginia's Congressional delegation to ask the federal government to give Virginia more flexibility with unemployment insurance if they cannot return to work due to valid COVID-19-related concerns.\n\nThey're also asking any workers who are concerned about unsafe conditions at their workplace to report them to the Department of Labor.\n\nThe governor's main goal, he said, is for Virginians to be careful and cautious, especially moving into reopening.\n\n\"Our efforts have slowed the spread, but they have not cured the disease,\" he said, adding that it's more important than ever for Virginians to behave cautiously as we ease restriction â€“ if not for their own sake, for the vulnerable, like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.\n\nWithout a vaccine or a proven treatment, Northam said being cautious is the only way to handle a virus we may be living with for months or years.\n\nWith elective procedure resuming across Virginia, Northam also encouraged all Virginians to take care of their health and see a doctor or provider if needed, saying that people cannot let illnesses or injuries go untreated because of coronavirus.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Northam said, repeating a phrase he has used frequently throughout the pandemic, and he asked everyone to \"continue to act with your own health and the health of others in mind.\"\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health is reaching out to physicians across Virginia to get their expertise, conducting a needs assessment of all doctors to determine how best to move forward for all of them in the weeks ahead.\n\nState health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver, reviewing Virginia's current COVID-19 case, death, and hospitalization statistics, pointed out that demographic data shows a disproportionately high number of case and death numbers among the Latinx community.\n\nDr. Oliver specifically pointed to the\n\n, stating that he believes it's largely correlated to outbreaks in and around poultry plants, which employ disproportionately large numbers of Latinx workers.\n\nDr. Remley, heading up Virginia's testing task force, said officials helping ramp up testing in Virginia are working with free clinics and drugstores to expand testing sites.\n\nBut their man focus at the moment, she said, is to work out the testing chain to get everyone on the same page and reach around 10,000 tests a day by the end of next week.\n\nHowever, she said, even once to that trend, there's no guarantee that number gets hit every day. For instance, testing usually drops over the weekends.\n\nThe goal, she said, is to get to a point where every Virginian with symptoms can have the opportunity to get tested.\n\nA representative of the Virginia Employment Commission said they have been able to get benefits for over 70,000 gig workers and self-employed workers since adding a process to expand eligibility through their system.\n\nAcknowledging but largely dismissing reports from many people about problems with the VEC system, the representative said many people are receiving their benefits and that they're still ramping up staff to handle more calls and the appeals process.\n\nAs has been mentioned in many of the most recent governor's briefings, facilities in Virginia with confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks cannot be identified by the Virginia Department of Health unless the facility chooses to publicly release their identity.\n\nThat has resulted in many long-term care centers, businesses, and apartment complexes, among other kinds of facilities, facing outbreaks that the community never has confirmation about.\n\nDr. Oliver has said they can't identify the facilities because the Virginia code treats facilities as \"persons\" and prohibits the release of health information about persons.\n\nHowever, some state lawmakers have proposed a bill that would change that part of the state code and allow the health department to share more information on places with outbreaks.\n\nAsked if he would support that bill, Gov. Northam said it's difficult for him to respond to questions about if he'll support bills because so much can change about a specific bill as it goes through the process from the House to the Senate and eventually gets to his desk.\n\nBut he said he supports transparency and wants to let the public and loved ones know what's going on in long-term care centers.\n\nThe governor said, overall, he is open to the idea, but would need to review the details of the legislation.\n\nHe said he suspects the part of the Virginia code causing the issue was meant to protect patient privacy, so he said any change would need to still protect that.\n\nGovernor Northam thanked business owners and all consumers with plans to move forward to Phase 1.\n\nHe encouraged all Virginians to start thinking about what it will take for you to be comfortable going back into places of businesses because that's what he says the state needs to hear to develop future guidance.\n\nThe statewide situation in Virginia\n\nVirginia remains under a series of public health orders and executive orders designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the commonwealth. The timeline of those measures can be seen below.\n\nOn Monday, May 4, Governor Ralph Northam announced that\n\n, which closed many non-essential businesses across Virginia, would be extended until May 14.\n\nAt that same briefing, the governor\n\n, which he said he anticipates will begin on Friday, May 15. At that point, at least some of the businesses that had to close due to EO 53 will be able to reopen, though they'll operate with restrictions in place, including social distancing measures, safety measures like PPE for employees, and increases sanitation.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 29, Gov. Northam\n\n, letting elective procedures resume on May 1. That also effectively re-opened dentist's offices for regular appointments and veterinarian's offices.\n\nOn April 24, the governor\n\n, calling for the commonwealth to see a 14-day trend of declining daily case totals before the process begins.\n\nExecutive Order 53, which closed many non-essential businesses and banned gatherings of more than 10 people and is now set to last until at least May 14, had been\n\nbefore being extended again this month.\n\n, the 'Stay at Home' order signed by Northam on March 30, is set to run through at least June 10, as it has been since its signing. It instructs all Virginians to stay home except for essential needs.\n\nVirginia remains under a state of emergency until June 10 as well.\n\nOf the orders in place, Executive Order 53 is enforceable by law, so someone who hosts a gathering of more than 10 people can be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. You can learn more about what police enforcement of Northam's executive orders looks like\n\n.\n\nVirginia's\n\nand the\n\nhave each been postponed by two weeks as well.\n\nStatewide case totals and testing numbers as of May 8\n\nBy May 8, the Virginia Department of Health had received reports of 21,274 confirmed and 1,068 probable cases of COVID-19 across the commonwealth.\n\n\"Probable\" cases are cases that were diagnosed by a doctor based on symptoms and exposure without a test â€“ also known as clinical diagnoses.\n\nThose positive test results are out of 143,220 total tests administered in Virginia, which were between 128,877 unique people. (\n\nthat around 10% of people get tested more than once, so the state now reports both total tests and total people tested).\n\nTests from Monday to Tuesday increased by more than 5,000. From Tuesday to Thursday, there were 8,620 new tests, and from Thursday to Friday, tests rose by 6,662.\n\nOverall, considering testing numbers and positive results, about 15.6% of Virginians who have been tested have received positive results. The recent increase in testing has already brought that percentage point down from over 17% last week â€“ and that number is a key to reopening on schedule, Gov. Northam\n\n.\n\nAt this point, 3,059 Virginians have been hospitalized due to the disease caused by the virus, and at least 812 have died of causes related to the disease - an increase of 43 deaths since Thursday.\n\nThe hospitalization and death numbers are the totals confirmed by the Virginia Department of Health, which are always delayed by several days due to the logistics of medical facilities reporting information to local health districts, when then report it to the state health department.\n\nThe\n\nshows a lot of detail by locality, including hospitalizations and deaths for each city or county, and will soon be updated to break the data down by zip code as well.\n\nThe hospitalization numbers are cumulative â€” they represent the total number of people hospitalized due to the disease throughout the outbreak and not the total number currently in the hospital.
