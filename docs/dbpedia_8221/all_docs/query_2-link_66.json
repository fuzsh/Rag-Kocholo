        "text": "About Port Arthur LNG\n\nPort Arthur LNG Phase 1, which is currently under construction, represents a $13 billion investment in new energy infrastructure in Texas that will stimulate local, regional, and national economies by creating U.S. jobs, supporting small businesses and strengthening the U.S. natural gas sectorâ€™s leadership position as a reliable partner in building energy security worldwide.\n\nThe natural gas liquefaction and export terminal in Jefferson County, Texas has direct access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Sabine-Neches ship channel. The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 facility is designed to include two natural gas liquefaction trains, two liquified natural gas (LNG) storage tanks and associated facilities with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa).\n\nPort Arthur LNG Phase 1 is a joint venture project between Sempra Infrastructure and ConocoPhillips and has long term, fully subscribed capacity with ConocoPhillips, RWE Supply and Trading, PKN Orlen S.S., INEOS and Engie S.A.\n\nThe expected commercial operation dates for Train 1 and Train 2 are 2027 and 2028, respectively.\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the project began shortly after a positive final investment decision was reached in March 2023. Sempra Infrastructure contracted with global engineering, procurement and construction firm Bechtel Energy Inc. for the construction of the project.\n\nPort Arthur LNG continues to focus its community development initiatives on local priorities which include education and leadership development, environmental stewardship, and safety. Since 2015, Port Arthur LNG has invested more than $40 million to support Jefferson County communities, including working with local vendors to procure materials and services for the relocation of a 3.5-mile portion of Highway 87 and on grants to more than 60 local non-profits, schools and business development groups. The Port Arthur LNG project is expected to create an estimated 5,000 highly skilled jobs during construction and boost the economies in Port Arthur and Jefferson County.\n\nView Project Milestones"
