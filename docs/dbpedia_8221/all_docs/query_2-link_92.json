        "text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - State Attorney General Anne Lopez on Wednesday released what’s been described as the first phase of an exhaustive probe into the catastrophic Maui wildfires, offering a minute-by-minute timeline of how flames engulfed Lahaina.\n\nThe long-awaited report and related documents were posted on the state’s website.\n\nThe investigation did not consider a cause — that’s being handled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms. Rather, the first phase focused on three main areas: pre-fire conditions and how the environment played a role, the fire’s progression, and the emergency response.\n\n“This phase one is so that we can understand what happened on a minute-by-minute basis,” Lopez said, at a news conference with the report’s lead authors. “The underlying foundation of this report is not to place blame on anybody. This is about never letting this happen again.”\n\nThe 400-page report was released after months of delay, largely blamed on challenges with getting information and access to Maui County employees and officials. The Fire Safety Research Institute was contracted to handle the independent probe at a cost of more than $1.5 million. The second phase will analyze the response while phase three will include recommendations.\n\nDerek Alkonis, research program manager at the fire safety institute, said phase one was intentionally designed as a starting point. “We wanted to understand the areas where lives were lost, understand the fire’s progression through those areas, which required hundreds of pictures and videos on the ground, from the air, and even reaching out to residents,” he said.\n\nThe report’s release comes a day after the Maui Fire Department presented the results and recommendations from its “after-action” report on last year’s wildfire devastation, saying changes had already been made based on lessons learned.\n\nWATCH THE FULL NEWS CONFERENCE:\n\nFor Maui residents, the report’s findings may be interesting — but they won’t be surprising.\n\nAttorney Elizabeth Nardi lost her home in the fire and was trapped in Lahaina like thousands of other residents, desperately trying to escape. After taking a look at the report, she said that “nothing was shocking because I lived that day. So I knew. None of this is surprising.”\n\nJon Givens, an attorney representing victims and their families, said he’s disappointed more than eight months after the disaster it remains unclear how the fires started and who is responsible.\n\nMeanwhile, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said the report offers a long list of lessons on how to handle future disasters. “I’m hoping we can learn more about evacuation. It’s a combination of trying to prevent, trying to mitigate, and of course, working on evacuation,” he said.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n\nMaui Fire after-action report finds flaws in preparation and partnerships\n\nAG’s wildfire probe doesn’t find fault with first responders, those briefed on report say\n\nState’s highly-anticipated independent probe into Maui wildfires delayed again\n\nMore training, tech among key recommendations in MPD ‘after-action’ report on Lahaina wildfire\n\nThis story will be updated."
