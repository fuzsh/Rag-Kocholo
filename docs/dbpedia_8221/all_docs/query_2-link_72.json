        "text": "Payments will be made to applicant providers who are in the filing TIN curated list from CMS if they are a Medicaid or CHIP provider. If a TIN is not on the curated list of state-submitted eligible Medicaid/CHIP providers or T-MSIS, it will be flagged as invalid. In these cases, HHS will work with the states/territories to verify whether the TIN should be included as a valid Medicaid or CHIP provider in good standing.\n\nIf a TIN is not on the curated list of dental providers, HHS will conduct additional analysis related to the TIN and any active dental providers associated with the TIN.\n\nIf a TIN is not on a curated list of assisted living facilities, HHS will conduct additional analysis related to the TIN and any currently operating assisted living facilities associated with the TIN.\n\nIf the TIN is subsequently marked as valid, the provider will be notified to proceed submitting data into DocuSign even if validation occurs after the September 13, 2020 deadline. Applicants validated after that date will have until October 4, 2020, 11:00pm EST to submit an application to be considered for funding under Phase 2. TINs that cannot be validated will not receive funding. Please note, the additional TIN validation may result in a delay in processing the application.\n\n(Updated 10/1/2020)"
