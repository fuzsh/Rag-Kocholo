        "text": "on\n\nWhile doing some work uncovering details on Fuji's Fujinon-EFC lenses, I ran across a reference to the Tominon E36 line of lenses. Finding info on them is even more difficult. I can't find anything through a search of this Forum. Does anyone know anything about the E36 lenses? I assume they are similar to the EFC lenses -- special purpose stuff like copy machines, faxes, mini-labs, etc.\n\nHi. They're stunning lenses - incredibly sharp.\n\nThey were produced principally for copying and were used in a lot of high-end film-labs. There were several lenses produced under the E36 MC label and at least a couple under the E36C name, the latter being a pre-set type whereas the E36 MC ones featured an iris, though I don't know how many blades were present.\n\nThe mount utilised a 39mm Leica thread. I think production only lasted about 5-6 years and had ceased completely by the late 1980s.\n\nHi,\n\nthat's really interesting. Thank you so much for that information - that's very helpful and contains some specifics I didn't know before. These lenses are among my favorite ones of all time and I've tried to gather as much informatin on them as I was able to during the last two years. Here's a quick summary of what I was able to find out so far:\n\nThere are actually more than just the E36 lenses... there are two (Copal) E18C ones with fixed aperture in 35 and 40 mm (there's an article/review on closeuphotography about them), then theres a whole range of E36(C) lenses (many different focal lengths), then there are the E66(C) lenses (there are only a couple of them) and the E90(C) with longer focal lengths. Some of the E36 lenses also appear as Tominon-MC, either with or without the E36 in the name and they seem to be the newer ones, at least from their appearance. I'm actually working with Mark (user 169 on here) on his DELTA alt lens list, and we're still in the process of adding details to the whole range of Tomioka made EXX(C) lenses. The E36 and E90 ones with aperture have 8 (straight) blades and the E66 have a round aperture with more blades.\n\nI've read two different things on their original use: 1.) that they were used in a kind of minilab and 2.) that they were high-resolution scanner lenses but I wasn't able to verify any of that so far. Do you know in what kind of device they were used in the high-end film-labs you mentioned?\n\nI've used both the Tomioka EXX(C) lenses (extensively) as well as the Fujinon-EFC ones for my photographic experiments here: simple.joy flickr\n\nI've designed a simple adapter for the Fujinon-EFC lenses but I haven't received it yet, because I can't do any CNC work myself but I agree that they seem somewhat similar and may be related in some way to the Tomioka ones. Another lens family which has some resemblance as well as very similar mounting devices (from the looks of it) are the \"Noritsu\" ones with variable focal length (38-60, 60-90 mm etc.) that I also used quite a bit for my macro/close-up experiments. They're maybe not quite up to the aforementioned Tomioka lenses, but pretty great as well and very affordable... that is, if you're able to mount them.\n\nThanks for creating this thread and the interesting information you shared on these lenses!\n\non\n\nLast Edit: by simplejoy\n\nHi simplejoy\n\nWelcome to the Forum.\n\nThank you very much for the additional info in your post. I don't recall the equipment used in the high-end labs which used those lenses but I'll check back through my records to see if there are any identifying data there.\n\nIt's also very interesting to hear about the mount you've created and are having made; please keep us posted on it as there may be people here who could be very interested...\n\nThank you for the welcome! That would be great - thanks a lot! I really appreciate anything you can provide on these lenses, because they really are very special to me and neither of the people I bought mine from could tell me anything about their origin.\n\nI'll make sure to provide an update when my EFC adapter shows up. However I have to add, that I'm using almost all of my lenses on a bellows, so the approach is perhaps not the best or easiest one for different mounting solutions.\n\nxkaes\n\nSo, the subclub site is yours? That's a wonderful and incredibly interesting site with lots of information - excellent work there and thank you for sharing your findings! I'm so glad to see that you've done some research on the EFC-lenses as well. You have listed quite a lot of them, but I think there are a number of additional ones, even though I don't have a complete list. I can tell you two of them though, because I own them: a 35 mm f/5.6 with variable aperture (5.6 to 11) and one that is (interestingly enough) labeled Fujinon-EFC II 64.5 f/6, also with a variable aperture (from 5.6 to 11, so not 6 like on the front!). All of mine have the same mounting thread, however I think their lens construction could be quite different from a quick reflection count, but I'm not quite sure about their optical layout yet. I'm also conflicted about the best direction to mount them in... I tried them the way you show on your bellows image at first, but actually had better results when I reversed them. I only tried it with one of them though, so it certainly requires some additional testing, as soon as I have my adapter ready.\n\non\n\nLast Edit: by xkaes\n\nI'm the originator of the SUBCLUB, but not the only organizer or moderator. There are only certain areas I'm particularly knowledgeable about. There are Minox experts, Tessina experts, 110 camera experts, HIT experts, etc. -- areas I'm clueless about.\n\nThe FUJINON-EFC lenses are recent additions that someone clued me in on -- so I added them, not to the SUBCLUB, but to my FUJINON Large Format Lens website.\n\nwww.subclub.org/fujinon/\n\nThe only enlarging lenses on the SUBCLUB are ones designed for small negatives -- 38mm or shorter.\n\nI recently updated the EFC lenses list. There are now 15 models -- and you've discovered TWO MORE. Thanks.\n\nwww.subclub.org/fujinon/efc.htm\n\nI had not heard of the EFC II lens, and I must assume there are more than just one. Do you know anything about what the II means?\n\nIf you could send me pictures of your EFC lenses, I would be very grateful.\n\nAnd I really enjoyed your FLICKR setup. I dabble in that arena of photography myself -- although I'm not as well-equipped as you. Since you have several FUJI optics, you might find my FUJINON Large Format material of interest.\n\non\n\nI'm the originator of the SUBCLUB, but not the only organizer or moderator.

Since you have several FUJI optics, you might find my FUJINON Large Format material of interest.\n\nThanks for the clarification and the Fujinon large format infos you've assembled - I'll take a look! Not to get sidetracked too much, but I love a lot of the Fujinon lenses. I have the majority of the Fujinon-EX enlarging lenses (which are among the very best), and two large format ones, a \"Fujinon-SWD 65 mm f/5.6“ and a „Fujinon-W 135 mm f/5.6“ both of which I've adapted to my bellows system.\n\nThe EFC lenses I own show a significant lack of contrast, but I think they have a lot of potential, if adapted properly. I have no idea what the difference between the regular EFC and EFC II is unfortunately, and because they all look kind of different anyway it's hard to tell if there have been changes compared to a prior version. I just assume they are newer iterations for now. Maybe some clear differences will show up once I'm able to shoot them side by side.\n\nHere are the images. You're welcome to use them of course, if you want. If you only need a detail image, you should be able to download the full size image via the flickr-link.\n\nReally glad you like my little lens-experiments - thank you very much!\n\nFujinon-EFC II 64.5 mm by simple.joy, auf Flickr\n\nFujinon-EFC 35 mm by simple.joy, auf Flickr\n\non\n\nLast Edit: by simplejoy\n\nTo get back to the original topic, here is how they look like:\n\nTomioka/Copal/Tominon-MC E36(C) lenses by simple.joy, auf Flickr\n\nThere are a couple of different designs (even among lenses of the same focal length) and many different types of inscriptions, but I would assume that all of them were made by Tomioka. There seems to be a connection to both Copal as well as Noritsu, so it's a real possibility that they were used in devices made by one or both of those companies. I have never tried to reach out to Kyocera, but I somehow doubt that they would be willing or even able to respond to any question in regards to these lenses. So if anyone stumbles across this and knows anything, I'm still highly interested in any information you can share.\n\nAnd this is one of the Noritsu lenses that I mentioned before:\n\nUnassuming zooming? by simple.joy, auf Flickr\n\nPerhaps they were the successor of the E36/E66/E90 lenses? They cover more than the whole range of them and more with a handful of lenses because they have a variable focal length).\n\nAgain - that's all speculation unfortunately, but Robert OToole mentions in his excellent comparison article on the Tominon-MC 48 mm that those were replaced by zoom-lenses. Maybe that's what was meant by this information, maybe not. In any case it would be very interesting to know if these variable focal length Noritsu lenses were also made by Tomioka or someone else."
