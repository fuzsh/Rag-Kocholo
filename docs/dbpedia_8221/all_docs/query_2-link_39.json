        "text": "Israeli photography company\n\nLeaf is an Israeli company that manufactures high-end digital backs for medium format and large format cameras. It was previously a division of Scitex and later Kodak, and is now a subsidiary of Phase One. In 1991, Leaf introduced the first medium format digital camera back, the Leaf DCB1, nicknamed ‘The Brick’, which had a resolution of 4 million pixels (4 megapixels). As of 2012, Leaf produces the Credo line of digital camera backs, ranging from 40 to 80 megapixels. Until 2010, Leaf also produced photography workflow software Leaf Capture.\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nDigital camera backs\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Leaf's DCB, the digital backs evolved into two product lines, the Aptus and the (now discontinued) Valeo. The main difference is that the Aptus models have a 3.5-inch touchscreen, where the Valeos have no on-board display. The Valeos can still be used untethered by using the DP-67 software or the more recent WiView software on a Compaq iPAQ. The iPAQs are connected via Bluetooth with the digital backs. For untethered usage, you will need battery packs for both the Aptus and the Valeo, otherwise the back must be powered via a FireWire connection to a computer. The Valeo models need a Leaf Digital Magazine as well for untethered use, where the Aptus models have a Compact Flash slot.[citation needed]\n\nCurrent models\n\n[edit]\n\nCredo is the current generation of digital camera backs from Leaf, and the first Leaf back based on Phase One platform and not Leaf legacy platforms. Some of the changes are that the back no longer has a cooling fan, but instead makes use of passive cooling. Also to be noted is the new hi res capacitive touch screen which no longer require stylus pen. The back also boots in one second with Phase One OS. Previous Windows CE operating system took up to 10 seconds to reboot.\n\nThe differences between Credo and Aptus II:\n\nInterface: Credo has both FW800 and USB3 interfaces. Aptus II has only FW800 interface. Aptus uses a proprietary L-shaped FW connector, while Credo uses a straight regular connector. Thick head connectors will not fit into either backs. Credo uses standard USB3 type B connector and standard cables may be used. Officially only 3 meter USB3 cables are supported, but 5 and 7.5 meters were tested and worked with repeaters. FW cables in Credo and Aptus are supported up to 10 meters.\n\nBattery: Credo uses an internal battery, and Aptus uses an external battery. Credo can't operate without a charged battery inside it. When Aptus is tethered it can work only without battery, as the battery port and cable port are overlapping. The Credo battery is charged when using powered FW800, but not when using USB. It is possible to use low powered Windows tablets to tether Credo, while Aptus generally requires tethering to a laptop which has a FW port that is powered from AC. Aptus can load a double capacity and size battery, which Credo can't, since the battery goes into a slot in the Credo body.\n\nScreen: Credo has a smaller screen but with more resolution. Credo has capacitive touch screen (more sensitive like current smart phones), and Aptus has a resistive touch screen (less sensitive, like older PDAs)\n\nConnection protocols: Credo is much faster to connect in tethering than Aptus, and establishes a more stable connection.\n\nColors: Credo colors are more accurate and less punchy and unique than Aptus colors.\n\nSensitivity - Credo is 1/3 stop more sensitive to light than Aptus, using the same ISO settings.\n\nBody compatibility: Aptus can work on all 645 Mamiya models from AFD and upwards. Credo requires 645DF and upwards, and can work with 645AFD III only when version 1 of the firmware is installed on it. Interfacing to non Mamiya 645 bodies, such a RZ67, HY6, Hasselblad H/V, Contax, tech cameras is unchanged from Aptus.\n\nLong exposures: Credo can do much longer exposures than Aptus with acceptable noise.\n\nNoise: Credo has slightly less noise in high ISO than Aptus in normal length exposures.\n\nFile format: Credo produces IIQ files same as Phase One backs. There are two types of files: large and small. Large has no compression and small has some compression and about half the size. The \"Large\" files can be opened by Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. IIQ files are not compatible with Leaf Capture.\n\nLive view: Credo has live view on the back's screen - Aptus has live view only on tethered computer. Since both live views are CCD based, they are significantly inferior to live views on current CMOS sensors.\n\nAll ports in the Credo body are covered (\"weather sealed\").\n\nCredo body is made of metal, Aptus has plastic/metal combination. Credo has a metal heatsink, while Aptus has a cooling fan, which makes some noise and can make the back freeze in icy winds.\n\nAptus has a detachable LCD protector cover which Credo does not have.\n\nTurning on/off: Tethered Aptus automatically turns on when the computer is turned on, and autocratically turns off when the computer is turned off. Credo must be turned on and off manually, and also turns off automatically after a period of idle time.\n\nModel Sensor Size Resolution Active Pixels ISO range Dynamic range Frames per Second Lens conversion factor Display Storage Host Connection Released Credo 50 44 x 33 mm 50 MP, 16 bit 8280 x 6208 100-6400 14 f-stops 1.2 1.25 3.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreen CF up to UDMA 6 IEE1394b FireWire 800 and USB3 2014 Credo 80 53.7 x 40.4 mm 80 MP, 16 bit 10328 x 7760 35–800 12.5 f-stops 0.7 1.0 2012 Credo 60 53.9 x 40.4 mm 60.5 MP, 16 bit 8984 x 6732 50–800 12.5 f-stops 1.0 1.0 2012 Credo 40 43.9 x 32.9 mm, 40 MP, 16 bit 7320 x 5484 50–800 12.5 f-stops 1.2 1.25 2012\n\nAptus II models are very similar to corresponding previous Aptus models, with the notable differences:\n\nLive view available with Phase One 645AF and 645DF bodies (+ Mamiya AFD III & DF), no dongle required.

adapter available from 3rd party Bronica SQA, SQAi, ETRSi (No longer made)\n\nIt is impossible to convert the mount of a digital back for a different medium format body via adapter or conversion plates, because the sensor would then not sit within the film plane (since the sensor needs to sit the same distance from the lens that the film would). Such conversion may be possible by sending the back to Leaf to be physically reconfigured, depending on the specific model.\n\nAny mount can be used on view cameras by using the correct adapter plate, for example: Alpha, Arca, Cambo, Horseman, Kata, Linhof, Sinar, Toyo, Rollei X-Act2, and other via Leaf Graflok or third party adapters. This is because view cameras have an adjustable focal plane.\n\nThe AFI backs (in the Discontinued Models) are specifically designed to work with Sinar and Rollei systems.\n\nAccessories\n\n[edit]\n\nLeaf Digital Magazine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Leaf Digital Magazine, or LDM, is a portable, small FireWire-powered hard drive that enables a digital back lacking a Compact Flash slot to be used untethered. There are three models, the 5GB, 10 GB and 20 GB. It can be mounted in the U-bracket, which can also contain two (smaller than normal) batteries. This U-bracket can then be mounted underneath the camera. There are short FireWire cables available to connect the LDM to the Leaf digital back.\n\nSoftware\n\n[edit]\n\nCapture One / Capture One Pro\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Capture One\n\nCapture One is a tethering software, Raw image format converter and workflow software which enables photographers to deliver ready-to-use images with adjusted color and detail. It is designed to create very high image quality and provides a series of tools created to match the professional photographer's daily workflow. Capture One replaced Leaf Capture as tethering and processing software for all Leaf Aptus and Aptus II backs.[5]\n\nLeaf Capture\n\n[edit]\n\nImage capture workflow software, available for Apple Inc. OS X and Microsoft Windows. Leaf capture is no longer developed, and is Replaced by Capture One for all Aptus and Aptus II models.\n\nImage comparison\n\nCamera control (of non-manual cameras)\n\nLoupe tool, focus preview\n\nRealtime live view display\n\nGrid and layout overlay\n\nColor temperature and tint sliders\n\nAdjustable histogram\n\nMoiré removal tool\n\nNote: From v11.2.9 on only supports Aptus models [6]\n\nLeaf Capture Remote App / Server\n\n[edit]\n\nUsed together, allows browsing of your \"Shots\" folder on wireless devices (iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone). The app works via the device's wireless local area network connection with Leaf Capture Server running on a host computer [7]\n\nLeaf WiView\n\n[edit]\n\nLeaf WiView is an update of the DP-67 software. It is an application that enables you to have wireless control (via Bluetooth) over your Leaf imaging module to view and edit images on an HP iPAQ Pocket PC as you shoot.\n\nKnown supported iPAQ models: hx2100, hx2400, hx2700, hx4700, rx5900, 110, 210.[8]\n\nKnown supported Leaf models: Valeo 17wi, Valeo 22wi, ...\n\nLeaf DP-67\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Leaf DP-67 application on an HP iPAQ allows wireless remote communication with the Leaf Valeo digital camera back via Bluetooth. The advantages of large storage space for your images and full control over the capture process are maintained by the Leaf Digital Magazine and Leaf DP-67 (iPAQ) display and control devices.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
