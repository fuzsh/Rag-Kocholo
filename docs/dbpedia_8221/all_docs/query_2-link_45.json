        "text": "Resources:Getting started with a Phase I award\n\nThis page has information, forms and opportunities for Phase I awardees. It also includes information you’ll need to apply for Phase II funding, and other useful resources. Please direct any questions to your program director or to sbir@nsf.gov.\n\nPlease view this 30-minute video that covers important information regarding your Phase I award:\n\nSBIR/STTR Phase I Workshop\n\nNSF requires each Phase I awardee company to participate in the SBIR/STTR Phase I Workshop. This virtual workshop (hosted on Zoom) consists of about 8-10 hours of sessions spread over three days. The first day of the workshop includes general-purpose sessions required for all Phase I awardees. The second day will feature a one-on-one meeting with your program director and other sessions. The principal investigator (PI) is required to participate, and we strongly suggest that the person(s) who lead the business activities (if not the PI) for the Phase I project also participate, as the workshop is heavily focused on commercial and entrepreneurial discussions.\n\nYou should receive information in the first 1-2 months of your award on how to register. If your team is unable to attend this required event, you will need to contact sbir@iqsolutions.com and your program director as soon as possible. Visit our workshop website for more information, plus dates of upcoming events.\n\nEntrepreneurial Training\n\nBoot Camp\n\nThe NSF SBIR “Beat-the-Odds Boot Camp” provides successful startup basics based on customer discovery methods used in I Corps and is designed specifically for NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I awardees. Please plan to participate. Beat-the-Odds Boot Camp participation eligibility is limited to awardees associated with solicitation NSF 23 -515 or earlier.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps)\n\nNSF I-Corps is an immersive, seven-week, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the translation of invention to impact. This program provides direct, hands-on experience in customer discovery — a key step in the entrepreneurial process that involves talking to and getting critical feedback from potential customers, partners, and other industry stakeholders. NSF I-Corps training program is highly recommended for solicitation NSF 25-579. See the solicitation for more information.\n\nCommercialization planning\n\nAll Phase I awardees are given the opportunity to work with a commercialization planning contractor under NSF’s Commercialization Assistance Program (CAP). Currently, NSF contracts with a third party, Dawnbreaker, to provide this service, which is free of charge for awardees. This program is designed to familiarize you with the commercialization plan which is a key part of a Phase II proposal, and to give guidance and feedback as you begin to draft this document. You will be contacted in the first months of your Phase I award to kick-off this activity.\n\nInformation for current Phase I awardees\n\nPhase I general award conditions\n\nWebinar: Cost Analysis and Pre-Award (CAP) & Division of Grants and Agreements (DGA) Open Session\n\nPhase I reporting requirements\n\nHow to apply for a Phase II award\n\nMaking changes to your award\n\nUseful information for Phase I awardees\n\nCommon forms and checklists\n\nRevising a budget\n\nTime extension (no-cost extension)\n\nChanges at your organization\n\nChange of PI (principal investigator)\n\nSpread the word\n\nAs an awardee, you’re the face of our program, and we hope you’ll share news of your successes for years to come. Learn how to become an ambassador.\n\nAbout America’s Seed Fund\n\nAmerica’s Seed Fund, powered by NSF, awards $200 million annually to startups and small businesses, transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial and societal impact. Startups working across almost all areas of science and technology can receive up to $2 million in non-dilutive funds to support research and development (R&D), helping de-risk technology for commercial success. America’s Seed Fund is congressionally mandated through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.
