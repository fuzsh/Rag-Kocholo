        "text": "Great Beyond says:\n\nDamnit - my Mamiya C3 Professional seems to be giving up the ghost. The winder isn't tracking right, so I'm getting a ton of double exposures as it;s not winding far enough. The local camera shop says that yeah, he can overhaul it - but it'll be just as cheap to go buy a new body.\n\nOh well.\n\nSo I cant find a C3 anywhere for love or money, but I did find a Mamiya C330 for about $275 and a C330S for about $450 (both with a blue dot 80mm lens).\n\nMy searching come up inconclusive as to what the difference is between the two, other than one is from the mid 80's and one from the mid 70's. And so I'll ask you guys - anyone know what the difference is and if its worth the extra 200 bones?\n\n6:04PM, 18 August 2015 PDT\n\nkuronakko says:\n\nC330S uses a brighter clearer ground glass focusing screen unique only to C330S.\n\nC330S is many ounces lighter than C330.\n\nC330S rear door locking mechanism and latch is unique only to C330S.\n\nC3330S has some internal mechanical improvements / updates over the C330.\n\nC330S is the final version of a long line of Mamiya TLR cameras made over many decades.\n\nC330S was made in fewer numbers and over a shorter period of time comparing to other C330 models so sometimes they are considered relatively more rare and harder to find.\n\nAs with most other final version models made by many other camera companies, they usually tend to command a higher premium over other older models.\n\nMany parts and system accessories for the C330S are not interchangeable with older C330 models.\n\n110 months ago\n\nRicardo Sforza says:\n\n...but it'll be just as cheap to go buy a new body...\n\nI second Circles motion !\n\nYou will buy a new - used - body, as the last new one of these was manufactured 30 yrs ago. No garantee that in 3 months time it wont konk out on you.\n\nFix the one you have. You know what its been through and properly repaired it will last you another ten years.\n\n110 months ago\n\nMetrix X says:\n\nThe plastic/nylon gears in the the film winder are a weak point in the 330 design aging and the extra stress put on them having to cock the shutter. The gears in c220 because you have to cock the shutter manually will last longer. The popup viewfinder/shade on the c220 is not as good at keeping out unwanted light as the one on the c330 but you could always use the one from your c3 if you decided to get a cheap c220 body on flee bay.\n\nStrange but I put a bright screen in my c220 although it looks bright it's actually doesn't add anything to the ability to find best focus.\n\n110 months ago\n\nRicardo Sforza says:\n\nAll plastics degrade with age, some types faster than others.\n\nWhile taking apart a Kodak Polaroid clone, the gears in it crumbled in my hand like dried mud.\n\nIf you have a camera that you love, best buy some spare bodies or better yet, unused replacements of said plastic parts and keep them in a cool place just in case. Generally , machines of a same model break the same parts and any mechanic will tell you which are the weak points in your particular camera.\n\nBlindly buying.a spare body and hoping for the best is one way to wind up with two cameras with the same part broken.\n\n110 months ago\n\nmorris 1800 says:\n\nMy old C3 had the same problem .It was the grease that had gone hard and a spring loaded pawl wasn't dropping back into a gear(metal gears) sometimes. Fairly straight forward but I still upgraded to a standard c330 which offered all the features I could want.\n\n110 months ago\n\nGreat Beyond says:\n\ninetjoker:\n\nWellll, yes and no. Hearing all kinds of opinions at least opens my options up. I'm leaning towards the 330 and not the 330S, mostly because it doesn't seem worth the extra 150 bucks. I'll have to think on it for a while.\n\n110 months ago"
