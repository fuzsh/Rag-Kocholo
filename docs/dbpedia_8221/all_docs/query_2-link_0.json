        "text": "Camera Manufacturer\n\nFor other uses, see Phase 1 (disambiguation).\n\nPhase One is a Danish company specializing in high-end digital photography equipment and software. It manufactures open platform based medium format camera systems and solutions. Its RAW processing software, Capture One, supports many DSLRs besides their backs.\n\nPODAS workshops (Phase One Digital Artist Series) is a series of worldwide photography workshops designed for digital photographers interested in working with medium format, high-resolution cameras. PODAS is a part of the Phase One educational division. Each attendee receives a Phase One digital camera system for the duration of the workshop.[2]\n\nOn 18 February 2014, it was announced that UK-based private equity firm Silverfleet Capital would acquire a 60% majority stake in the company.[3]\n\nOn 17 June 2019, Phase One A/S was once again sold, this time to the Danish investment company Axcel.[4]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nCameras\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, Phase One purchased a major stake in Japanese Mamiya and the two companies developed products together. The following cameras are currently produced and sold by Phase One:\n\nPhase One XC\n\nPhase One XT\n\nPhase One XF\n\nPhase One 645DF+ (discontinued)\n\nPhase One 645DF (discontinued)\n\nPhase One 645AF (discontinued)\n\nPhase One iXM (aerial, surveillance and UAV operations)\n\nPhase One iXA (Aerial)\n\nPhase One iXG (Reproduction)\n\nPhase One iXR (Reproduction)\n\nPhase One iXU (aerial, surveillance and UAV operations)\n\nPhase One iXU-RS (aerial, surveillance and UAV operations)\n\nPhase One iXU-RS1900 (Fully self contained dual camera solution)\n\nPhase One iXM\n\nPhase One iXM-RS\n\nPhase One iXM-MV (Machine Vision)\n\nPhase One iXH (Reproduction)\n\nPhase One iXM-SP (Made for Low Earth Orbit)\n\nThe Phase One 645DF+ and 645DF cameras are medium format cameras which support both focal plane and leaf shutter lenses with shutter speeds ranging from 1/4000s to 60 minutes and flash synchronization up to 1/1600 sec.[5][6] Among the new features on the 645DF+ are:[5]\n\nFast and accurate auto focus especially in low contrast environments\n\nCustom focus fine-tuning adjustment\n\nRechargeable Li-ion battery with up to 10,000 captures on one charge\n\nRugged construction for high volume production use\n\nThe Phase One V-Grip Air vertical grip is compatible with the 645DF+/645DF. The V-Grip Air supports a Profoto Air flash trigger for wireless flash synchronization.[7]\n\nThe 645DF+/645DF supports digital back interfaces including the IQ and P+ series digital backs as well as 3rd party digital backs from Hasselblad, Leaf and others.\n\nIn 2012, Phase One released two specialty cameras: iXR[8] which is made specifically for reproduction and iXA[9] which is made specifically for aerial photography. Both uses the 645 lenses as the normal 645 cameras. Main difference on this camera is they have no viewfinder and very few mechanical moving parts.\n\nIn 2013, Phase One signed a collaborative distribution agreement with Digital Transitions (DT) to deliver advanced digitization solutions for cultural heritage preservation imaging projects worldwide (Repro camera solutions). The range of Digital Transitions digitization equipment includes a multitude of reprographic benches, purpose-built reprographic cameras, specialized book copy stations, film scanning kits, and accessories that are designed to host the line of Phase One digital capture hardware and Capture One software.\n\nIn 2014, Phase One launched a medium format digital back with a CMOS/active pixel sensor: The IQ250. All Phase One digital backs launched prior to the IQ250 have sensors based on the CCD (Charge-coupled device) technology.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2015, Phase One introduced the XF camera system. It is a new digital camera platform, medium format system built with the intention to upgrade it over a series of updates throughout the product lifetime. At the same time, the IQ3 series digital backs were introduced. This included the IQ3 50MP based on the previous IQ250, the IQ3 60MP based on the previous IQ260 and the newly introduced IQ3 80MP which includes a new CCD (Charge-coupled device) sensor exclusive to Phase One.[citation needed]\n\nLenses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 645DF / DF+ / XF is compatible with the following lenses:\n\nPhase One Digital focal plane lenses\n\nSchneider Kreuznach leaf shutter lenses\n\nMamiya 645 AF lenses\n\nMamiya 645 manual lenses (mechanical lens modification is required for the Phase One XF)\n\nCompatible with Hasselblad V and Pentacon 6 (via multimount adaptor)[10]\n\nPhase One\n\n[edit]\n\nFocal length Maximum Aperture range Designator Optical Construction Shutter speed Minimum focusing distance Filter thread Equivalent 35mm Focal Length Dimension

It was also the first camera series to include a high resolution multi-touch display, similar to the \"Retina\" screen used in the iPhone 4.[11]\n\nModel Sensor size Sensor type Resolution (Sensor+ mode) Active pixels ISO range (Sensor+ mode) Dynamic range Frames per Second (Sensor+ mode) Lens conversion factor Display Storage Host connection Released IQ1 100MP 53.7 × 40.4 mm CMOS 101 MP (N/A), 16-bit 11608 × 8708 50–12800 (N/A) 15 f-stops 0.7 / (N/A) 1.0 3.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type touchscreen CF up to UDMA 6 IEE1394b Firewire800, USB3 / USB2 2016 IQ180 53.7 × 40.4 mm CCD 80 MP (20 MP), 16-bit 10328 × 7760 35–800 (140 - 3200) 12.5 f-stops 0.7 / (0.9) 1.0 2011 IQ160 53.9 × 40.4 mm CCD 60.5 MP (15 MP), 16-bit 8984 × 6732 50–800 (200 - 3200) 12.5 f-stops 1.0 / (1.4) 1.0 2011 IQ150 44.0 × 33.0 mm CMOS 50.0 MP (N/A), 14-bit 8280 × 6208 100 - 6400 14 f-stops 1.2 1.3 2014 IQ140 43.9 × 32.9 mm CCD 40 MP (10 MP), 16-bit 7320 × 5484 50–800 (200 - 3200) 12 f-stops 1.2 / (1.8) 1.3 2011\n\nP+ series\n\n[edit]\n\nThe P+ series are similar to the normal P series but have higher capture speeds, better response to long exposure times, and add Live Preview, which allows the user to focus and compose on a monitor while tethered. Also, a new high resolution LCD screen was implemented with better resolution and luminance.\n\nModel Sensor size Resolution (Sensor+ mode) Active pixels ISO range (Sensor+ mode) Dynamic range Frames per Second (Sensor+ mode) Lens conversion factor Display Storage Host connection Released P65+ 53.9 × 40.4mm 60.5 MP (15 MP), 16-bit 8984 × 6732 50–800 (200-3200) 12.5 f-stops 1.0 / (1.4) 1.0 2.2-inch 230,000 px TFT CF IEEE 1394 Firewire 2008 P45+ 49.1 × 36.8 mm 39 MP, 16-bit 7216 × 5412 50–800 12 f-stops 0.67 1.15 2007 P40+ 43.9 × 32.9 mm 40 MP (10 MP), 16-bit 7320 × 5484 50–800 (200 - 3200) 12 f-stops 1.2 / (1.8) 1.25 2009 P30+ 44.2 × 33.1 mm 31.6 MP, 16-bit 6496 × 4872 100–1600 12 f-stops 0.8 1.25 2007 P25+ 48.9 × 36.7 mm 22 MP, 16-bit 5436 × 4080 50–800 12 f-stops 0.67 1.15 2007 P21+ 44.2 × 33.1 mm 18 MP, 16-bit 4904 × 3678 100–800 12 f-stops 1.25 1.25 2007 P20+ 36.9 × 36.9 mm 16 MP, 16-bit 4080 × 4080 50–800 12 f-stops 0.87 1.5 2007\n\nP series\n\n[edit]\n\nThe P series are fully untethered backs available for many different camera mounts.\n\nModel Sensor size Resolution Active pixels ISO range Dynamic range Frames per Second Lens conversion factor Display Storage Host connection Released P45 49.1 × 36.8 mm 39 MP, 16-bit 7216 × 5412 50–400 12 f-stops 0,58 1.15 2.2-inch 116,000 px TFT CF IEEE 1394 Firewire 2005 P30 44.2 × 33.1 mm 31.6 MP, 16-bit 6496 × 4872 100–800 12 f-stops 0,67 1.25 2005 P25 48.9 × 36.7 mm 22 MP, 16-bit 5436 × 4080 50–800 12 f-stops 0,58 1.15 2004 P21 44.2 × 33.1 mm 18 MP, 16-bit 4904 × 3678 100–800 12 f-stops 1,0 1.25 2005 P20 36.9 × 36.9 mm 16 MP, 16-bit 4080 × 4080 50–800 12 f-stops 0,7 1.5 2004\n\nH series\n\n[edit]\n\nThe H series are tethered backs available for many different camera mounts. Camera back connects through standard 6pin IEEE 1394. Originally this type of camera back was released as the \"Lightphase\", a continuation of Phase One's previous tradition of using the name \"phase\" in the name of the product. This changed with the release of the \"H20\", which was originally called \"Lightphase H20\" but the name was changed to \"Phase One H20\" for better brand recognition.\n\nModel Sensor size Resolution Active pixels ISO range Dynamic range Frames per Second Lens conversion factor Display Storage Host connection Released H25 48.9 × 36.7 mm 22 MP, 16-bit 5436 × 4080 50–400 12 f-stops 0,5 1.15 N/A N/A IEEE 1394 Firewire 2003 H20 36.9 × 36.9 mm 16 MP, 16-bit 4080 × 4080 50–100 12 f-stops 0,33 1.5 2001 H101 / H10 36.9 × 24.6 mm 11 MP, 16-bit 3992 × 2656 50–400 1.65 2002 H5/H10 36 × 24 mm 6 MP, 16-bit 3056 × 2032 50–100 1.65 2002 Lightphase 36 × 24 mm 6 MP, 16-bit 3056 × 2032 50–100 1.65 1998\n\nScan backs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scan backs are tethered digital scan backs. All use SCSI connection except for PowerPhase FX, which uses IEEE 1394 \"Firewire\". The very early models, which were known as the CB6x (StudioKit) and FC70 (PhotoPhase), were made in plastic and had an external control unit that connected to a computer through NuBus.\n\nModel Sensor size Resolution ISO range Host connection Released PowerPhase FX/FX+ 12,600 steps × 10,500 pixels 132 MP, 14-bit 100–1600 IEEE 1394 Firewire 2000 PowerPhase 7,000 steps × 7,000 pixels 36 MP, 12-bit N/A SCSI 1997 PhotoPhase 7,200 steps × 5,000 pixels 36 MP, 10-bit N/A 1996 StudioKit 3,600 steps × 2,500 pixels 9 MP, 10-bit N/A 1996\n\nThe XF Camera System is upgradable and received various planned new features and functionality over its product lifetime.\n\nFeature Update #1 -
