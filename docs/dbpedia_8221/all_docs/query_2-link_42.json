        "text": "The city of Lexington will implement Phase One of the Heat Plan from Friday, June 28, through Saturday evening, June 29.\n\nAs part of Phase One, the following actions will occur:\n\nLextran will provide rides to cooling stations for those experiencing homelessness free of charge.\n\nOutreach teams will distribute water throughout the community.\n\nLexington’s community centers will be open into the early evening and are available as cooling stations. These locations include Dunbar, Kenwick, Castlewood and Tates Creek.\n\nThe heat index is forecasted to be 97 degrees today and 100 degrees on Saturday. Lexington will monitor the heat index and expand options and resources as necessary. The heat index combines temperature and humidity to approximate how hot it “feels” outside.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management encourages all residents to take precautions if outdoors, especially during the late morning through the afternoon. The very young, the elderly, and those with medical conditions are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses and should seek shelter from the extreme heat. More information about handling extreme heat is available from the Lexington Emergency Management website at BeReadyLexington.com/extreme-heat."
