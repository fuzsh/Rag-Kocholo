        "text": "The Mamiya-OP Co., Ltd. ( ) share price has fared very poorly over the last month, falling by a substantial 25%. The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 8.2% over that longer period.\n\nEven after such a large drop in price, Mamiya-OP may still be sending very bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 3.3x, since almost half of all companies in Japan have P/E ratios greater than 15x and even P/E's higher than 23x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.\n\nRecent times have been quite advantageous for Mamiya-OP as its earnings have been rising very briskly. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings growth might actually underperform the broader market in the near future. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.\n\nAlthough there are no analyst estimates available for Mamiya-OP, take a look at this to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHow Is Mamiya-OP's Growth Trending?\n\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Mamiya-OP would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 89% last year. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.\n\nThis is in contrast to the rest of the market, which is expected to grow by 9.6% over the next year, materially higher than the company's recent medium-term annualised growth rates.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Mamiya-OP's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nShares in Mamiya-OP have plummeted and its P/E is now low enough to touch the ground. It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that Mamiya-OP maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nIf P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free"
