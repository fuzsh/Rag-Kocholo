        "text": "These terms and conditions apply to the Mamiya Jewellers Web site located at www.mamiyadiamonds.com, and all associated Web sites linked to www.mamiyadiamonds.com by Mamiya Jewellers, its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Mamiya Jewellers sites around the world (collectively 'the Site'). Please read these terms and conditions (the 'Terms and Conditions') carefully. BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\nThese Terms and Conditions govern your use of, and any purchase from, the Mamiya Jewellers Site, and constitute an agreement between you and Mamiya Jewellers. Mamiya Jewellers reserves the right to change or modify any of these Terms and Conditions or any policy or guideline of the Site at any time, and in its sole discretion. Any change or modification will be effective immediately upon posting of the revisions on the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of its changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Therefore, you should frequently review these Terms and Conditions and any other applicable policies from time-to-time to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Site. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Site.\n\nProduct Availability and Pricing\n\nIf you're interested in a piece of jewellery that is currently on back order, call us and we can tell you when the item will be back in stock. Sometimes with the volume of orders we receive, an item may go out of stock before we are able to post a notification on the Site. If this happens, we will contact you directly to discuss possible options.\n\nData, including prices, may be inaccurately displayed on our Site due to system or typographical errors. While we make every attempt to avoid these errors, they may occur. We reserve the right to correct any and all errors when they do occur, and we do not honor inaccurate or erroneous prices. If a product's listed price is lower than its actual price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping the product or cancel the order and notify you of such cancellation. If the order has been shipped, you agree to either return the product or pay the difference between the actual and charged prices. Our prices are also subject to change without notice. This is mainly due to fluctuations in gold prices and availability of genuine source of loose diamonds at reasonable price structure. We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact one of our Diamond and Jewelery Consultants at [email protected]\n\nDiamond Certificates\n\nWhen you order a loose diamond, we ship it along with the accompanying diamond grading report (also called a diamond certificate). These grading reports are detailed documents created by diamond grading experts at one of two highly-respected diamond laboratories - (e.g - IGI, GIA, HRD) making it very expensive to replace such diamond grading reports. Because of this, we require each diamond grading report to be included with each returned diamond. If you do not include the diamond grading report with your return, you will be charged a replacement fee of $250 or AED 950 or more depending upon size of diamond.\n\nComparison Purchasing\n\nTo keep our prices low, we do not allow comparison purchasing. Comparison purchasing is the act of buying several items with the intent of keeping the one you like best and returning the remainder. This causes undue restocking and inventory overhead and can be very costly. To confirm the quality of a jewellery item, please contact one of our Diamond and Jewellery at [email protected], and we would be happy to help you make your choice.\n\nInformation on our Site\n\nAt Mamiya Jewellers, we make every attempt to ensure that our online catalogue is as accurate and complete as possible. In order to give you the opportunity to view our products in great detail, some products may appear larger or smaller than their actual size in our photographs; and since every computer monitor is set differently, color and size may vary slightly.\n\nOur objective is to provide you with as much information and detail about your prospective purchase as possible so that you can see the beauty and shape of a particular item. In compliance with industry standards or Gold and Jewelery Group of Dubai, Mamiya Jewellers states that carat total weight in all purchases may vary 0.05 carats from stated weight.\n\nOn the Site, we provide the measurement of our products based on our manufacturing specifications. Slight tolerances may be accounted for based on finishing during the manufacturing. Width tolerance on machine made wedding bands of 0.20mm is allowed. Cast manufactured rings can vary slightly more.\n\nFor gemstone and pearl measurements, a tolerance of 0.25mm is allowed.\n\nFor diamond jewellery set with multiple diamonds, we provide the minimum total carat weight for the piece. Colour and clarity grades are expressed as either a minimum or an average depending on the number of diamonds. If stated as a minimum, all diamonds within the piece are at or above the stated quality. If expressed as an average, collectively the quality is equal to or exceeds the grade stated.\n\nPolicy on Ethical Sourcing\n\nAt Mamiya Jewellers, we only purchase diamonds through the largest and most respected suppliers (from Belgium, India and mainly who are DTC site holders) who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the standards established by the Kimberley Process, an international system that polices the trade of diamonds to ensure they are from sources free of conflict. Read more about Mamiya Jewellers policy on ethical sourcing and the steps we take to ensure our diamonds are from conflict free sources.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nPlease refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how Mamiya Jewellers collects, uses, and discloses personally identifiable information from its customers.\n\nSite Content\n\nThe Site and all content and other materials, including, without limitation, the Mamiya Jewellers logo, and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, selection, coordination, 'look and feel', information, data, software, sound files, other files and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, the \"Site Materials\") are the proprietary property of Mamiya Jewellers or its licensors or users and are protected by trade dress, copyright, patent and trademark laws, and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws.\n\nTrademarks\n\nYou may not use any metatags or any other \"hidden text\" utilizing \"Mamiya Jewellers\" or any other name, trademark or product or service name of Mamiya Jewellers or mamiya diamonds without our prior written permission.
