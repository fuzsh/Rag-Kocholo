        "text": "Bo Eder says:\n\nI think any of the modern wide types of straps should work. I use that gripper strap by Domke and the nylon strap is about 3/8\" wide. I just wanted to have that gap in the strap holder filled.\n\nYou should confuse everyone and get a strap that says Nikon, or Canon, or even more absurd: Sinar.\n\nI personally haven't seen an original strap for these cameras.\n\nages ago\n\nChromagraphPhotoArt says:\n\nIf it's a 330s, then you are probably limited to Mamiya straps as they changed the design of the strap lug at some point. I used many years ago to own a M645J and it had the same system. I think also the RB67 uses the same type so new straps should still be available. I wouldn't like to carry mine around for too long on it's strap, so am thinking about bags (see separate thread.)\n\nAndy\n\nages ago\n\nthe brownhorse says:\n\ndoes anyone know if the Op/Tech attachment pack works with the C330 Pro S. and if so, which one to go for?\n\ni've been trying to find a strap for my camera, i now have, from eBay, the Op/Tech Weight Reduction System, but i need a way of attaching it to the pesky round lugs on the Pro S, model, why oh why did they change it.\n\ni've looked all over the internet and can't find anything that'll work, do you know of anything and where i can get one that does work in the UK?\n\nthanks for looking\n\nages ago\n\nthe brownhorse says:\n\nUPDATE:\n\ni had ordered the op/tech pro strap (for heavy cameras) and i had a good look at the different attachments.\n\nIt seems that Mamiya decided to fit different lugs to different cameras. Some (the lucky ones) have just a metal loop, enabling any strap to be used. and others, including my C330 have a round lug, which is virtually impossible to find a strap for.\n\nIn the end i got the op/tech Super pro A adapter. as this had round holes and not the square ones of the pro B adapter. I thought this might work, but when it turned up they were too small to fit on the lugs (aaarrrhhhhggg), maybe the pro B might fit, but in a fit of rage i got my power drill out and made the holes bigger my self. now it fits like a glove.\n\nso whats the moral of the story.....well i suppose its, either fit sensible lugs to your camera, don't bother carrying a brick lick camera around or if you want something doing right, do it yourself.\n\nages ago\n\nmattneighbour says:\n\nI never got a strap in the end. I bought a Mamiya side grip (intended for a 645 I think) which has a custom-made leather hand strap. I find it much more convenient.\n\nThinking about it, I would not want to drop my C330S+180mm with a strap around my neck, if I didn't break my neck then I would wind myself!\n\nages ago"
