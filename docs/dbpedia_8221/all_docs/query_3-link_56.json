        "text": "stevemark wrote:\n\nDuring the weekend I managed to update the information about Sekor E/EF primes on my website. The Sekor E/EF lineup was the last iteration of a long and successful series of Mamiya Sekor lenses for 35 mm SLRs. Due to the collapse of Osawa in 1984 (Mamiya distributor in the US and elsewhere) Mamiya stopped producing 35mm SLRs, and the corresponding Sekor E lineup probably never was completed as planned. Superwides and a Fisheye (part of the previous Mamiya SX and/or Mamiya CS lineup) as well as portrait lenses were missing, but the most important primes in the 28mm, 35mm and 50mm as well as the 135mm, 200mm and 300mm focal lengths were available.\n\nHere are the links:\n\n2.8/28mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/571-mamiya-sekor-e-28mm-f28\n\n3.5/28mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/572-mamiya-sekor-e-28mm-f35\n\n2.8/35mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/573-mamiya-sekor-e-35mm-f28\n\n1.4/50mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/574-mamiya-sekor-e-50mm-f14\n\n1.7/50mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/576-mamiya-sekor-e-50mm-f17\n\n2/50mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/577-mamiya-sekor-e-50mm-f2\n\n3.5/50mm Macro: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/578-mamiya-sekor-e-50mm-f35-macro\n\n2.8/135mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/580-mamiya-sekor-e-135mm-f28\n\n3.5/135mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/579-mamiya-sekor-e-135mm-f35\n\n4/200mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/582-mamiya-sekor-e-200mm-f4\n\n4/300mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/583-mamiya-sekor-e-300mm-f4\n\nThere's nothing spectacular about these lenses. Many are solid performers, and a few clearly are built as budget lenses. Most are not that common or even somehow rare. Not much reliable information is available online, and therefore I have compared them with better known lenses (usually from CaKoMiNikon).\n\nSome additional images and information about the six Sekor E zooms ever produced will follow.\n\nS\n\n_________________\n\nwww.artaphot.ch stevemark wrote:\n\nkiddo wrote: Very nice and straight to find info, I see you're missing sx 50mm f2, lens that someone praised to be better than 1.8 (maybe you?) ,I'm after one SX 50mm lens and dunno which one to get\n\nI don't have an SX 2/50mm, and usually I don't write about stuff I haven't used myself. I have the older Auto Sekor 2/50mm, plus a few 1.8/55 lenses (two Auto Sekors with different optics, two Sekor ES with different barrel, and two identical SX). Plus two Tessar type 2.8/50 Auto Sekors which clearly are inferior to the faster double gauss Sekors.\n\nEspecially the 1.8/55 deserves some special attention since there are at least two different optical calculations (different diameter fo front lens and different performance). I have been writing about this before, including some test images.\n\nErnst Dinkla wrote:\n\nThere is something I wonder about. The Mamiya-Sekor E 50mm 2.0 that I have has a three row diamond texture focusing ring, plastic too. Your Mamiya-Sekor E 50mm 2.0 red S a near gear wheel texture focusing ring. So next to the E-EF distinction there is also at least a lens exterior difference in the E range too. Herron tells the red S lenses are for the ZM camera.\n\nYep, that's true. I got my own ZM at the age of 15y, and immediately fell in love with her (sort of). Clean and simple design, had everything essential and was easy to use. And three seemingly small, but important improvements over the ZE:\n\n1) A and M mode (ZE was only A mode)\n\n2) Small but useful grip (much easier to work with over an extended time)\n\n3) Split image indicator is horizontal (ZE was diagonal which is useless for portraits)\n\nBack then I didn't get any \"S\" lenses though since I already had a E 1.7/50 and a EF 1.4/50 \"non-S\".\n\nBTW the only \"S\" lenses ever built were Sekor E 1.7/50 S and Sekor E 2/50 S.\n\nErnst Dinkla wrote: The S stands for? Unlikely a coating difference as S would be interpreted as Single coating, no marketing man would allow that. Shake warning in the cameras existed already before the ZM model. More electronic contacts on the S lenses? Or more computing done within the lenses?\n\nBack in the early 1980s everything was \"S\". It usually meant \"Super\" Or \"Sports\" (cars). Or \"Special\". But \"S\" it had to be.\n\nLater replaced by \"X\" and later even by \"i-\" ...\n\nI think they simply changed the design of the lens. Even today it still looks modern! And the focusing grip finally was made of rubber which was/is much nicer to work with. On the other hand the distance and aperture marks now were just printed (previously they were \"engravings\" filled with color, although \"engraving\" is probably not the proper English term)\n\nkiddo wrote: An interesting point of view from someone who've bought mamiya lenses and cameras in the 60's\n\n\"The camera and lenses were generally considered 3rd tier quality in the 35mm line up. First tier was Leica, Contax, and Nikon. Second tier was Canon, Minolta, Pentax, Konica, & Topcon. Third tier was Mamiya(35mm), Petrie, Yashica (35mm), & Ricoh. Fourth Tier was the East German line Pentacon (old designs but pretty high optical quality), and whatever Russia was trying to sell based on Pentacon designs. People were aware of the Chinese Seagull cameras, but no one had ever actually seen one.\n\nThe difference in quality between 2nd & 3rd tier, was virtually nonexistent. 2nd Tier companies had bigger advertising budgets, better distribution, and more vocal and verbal fanboys (though in those days the term didn't exist - Bokeh didn't either, we just called it 'out of focus')\"\n\nThank you for that link! I can't contribute to how Mamiya was perceived in the 1960s in th US (don't remember that any more), but I can say somthing about Switzerland in the early 1980s!\n\n1) Nikon clearly was \"the\" professional 35mm SLR brand, with Nikon Europe headquarters in Zurich / Switzerland\n\n2) Canon was trying hard to get Number One with their New F1 and several incredible lenses (nFD 2.8/14mm L, 1.4/35mm L, 1.2/85mm L, 2.8/300mm L, 2.8/400mm L, 4.5/500mm L, 5.6/800mm L, 20-24mm L, 80-200mm L, 150-600mm L ...)\n\nProfessionals usually did prefer the Nikon F-2 over the Canon F-1, but they considered Canon Lenses to be better.\n\n3) Leica R was system was \"prestigious\", but overpriced and underwhelming (SLR without changeable viewfinder, limited lens lineup) and therefore something for lawyers, teachers, doctors and the like (Leica M just hade been \"reborn\", but was virtually non-existant)\n\n4) Minolta was selling very well as the typical SLR for serious amateurs. And I know some very successful Swiss photographers which were using Nikon outdoors (\"nobody was gonna book me if I wouldn't come with a Nikon\") and Minolta at home in the studio (\"better lenses, better viewfinder\").\n\n5) Pentax wasn't as common as the others, but available in every photo store\n\n6) Brands like Mamiya usually were sold by large distributors and at incredibly low prices (my father, around 1980, got the entire set of Mamiya ZE, 1.7/50, 3.5/28 and 3.5/135 for less than what the cheapest Minolta body would have cost at the local photo store)\n\n7) Eastern Germany SLRs were used only at schools: Simple, easy-to-teach, metal body, and CHEAP! Never heard of Russian (let alone Chinese) cameras back then ...\n\nkiddo wrote: It is still very interesting how history is working on people's evaluation over the time.\n\nToday we look at the lenses of a vintage camera system, and we reliably can judge their performance and their properties by looking/comparing thousands of images.\n\nBack then most people were buying a certain camera (including professionals!).\n\nThat's not the same thing.\n\nS\n\n_________________\n\nwww.artaphot.ch stevemark wrote:\n\nHere's an image of most of primes available as \"Sekor E\" - only the Sekor E 2/50mm is missing ...\n\nBack row, from left to right: Mamiya Sekor E 3.5/50mm Macro, 3.5/135mm, 2.8/135mm, 4/200mm and 4/300mm.\n\nFront row, from left to right: Mamiya Sekor E 2.8/35mm, 3.5/28mm, 2.8/28mm, 1.7/50mm and 1.4/50mm.\n\nIn the mean time I have also updated the information on all Sekor E zooms ever built. Here they are:\n\nFrom left to right: Mamiya Sekor E 3.5-4.5/28-50mm, 3.5-4.5/35-70mm, 3.5-4.5/35-105mm, 3.8/70-150mm, 4/80-200mm and 3.8/80-200mm\n\nLinks to the respective information:\n\nSekor E 3.5-4.5/28-50mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/588-mamiya-sekor-e-28-50mm-f35-45\n\nSekor E 3.5-4.5/35-70mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/586-mamiya-sekor-e-35-70mm-f35-45\n\nSekor E 3.5-4.5/35-105mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/587-mamiya-sekor-e-35-105mm-f35-43\n\nSekor E 3.8/70-150mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/589-mamiya-sekor-e-70-150mm-f38\n\nSekor E 3.8/80-200mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/584-mamiya-sekor-e-80-200mm-f38\n\nSekor E 4/80-200mm: http://www.artaphot.ch/mamiya/e-ef-lenses/164-mamiya-sekor-e-ef-lenses/585-mamiya-sekor-e-80-200mm-f4\n\nWhile the information presented is far from complete, it gives some clues about the performance of these lenses compared to contemporary better known peers. I sooner or later will add some information about vignetting, distortion (important for zooms) and bokeh.\n\nS\n\n_________________\n\nwww.artaphot.ch\n\nLast edited by stevemark on Wed Oct 18, 2023 9:27 pm; edited 1 time in total"
