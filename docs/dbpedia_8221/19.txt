Phase One just acquired Mamiya Digital Imaging and took over their factory as well. This will strengthen the Danish company by making them the only medium format camera company that has full internal control of all critical components in a world class imaging system.

The story between Phase One and Mamiya didn't start today. It all began in 2009 when Phase One bought 45 percent of Mamiya Digital Imaging's shares. Before that, Mamiya was seemingly struggling to adapt to the digital era. But in 2012, with Phase One on board and Leaf joining as well, new products made their way to photographers. For example, the 645DF+ introduced this very same year. However, it seems like quite a few photographers mixed up the two brands — Phase One and Mamiya Leaf — as they shared a similar camera body platform.

With this acquisition, Phase One has now full control over the development and manufacturing of their cameras, shutters, and lenses. Until now, they had to rely on Mamiya and other partners for all of their products. Even though one might suppose Mamiya's engineers will still be in play, this will probably make things easier, and thus faster for Phase One.

As far as what this deal will change for the company's future products, nothing is certain. We can only make wild guesses. One thing is sure, according to Phase One Vice President Niels V. Knudsen, it is only for the best: "This is the best news in many years for quality-focused photographers and imaging companies as Phase One works to consistently raise the bar in medium format photography."

Let's wait and see what is going to happen in the next couple of months or years.
