Phase One has acquired the assets of Mamiya Digital Imaging Company, Ltd, (MDI) and has subsequently established Phase One Japan, with Makoto Honda being appointed as the new president.

As a 45% shareholder in MDI since 2009, Phase One has developed detailed insight into the camera and lens design and production process and engineered important improvements through its close collaboration with the MDI team in Japan, according to a press release on the acquisition. With this transaction, Phase One takes total ownership for all aspects of design and development of medium format camera systems, central shutters, and lenses. As a result, the company now touts itself as the only medium format camera company that has full internal control of all critical components in its imaging system.

"The very successful introduction of the Phase One XF Camera System in June 2015 illustrates the power of our collaboration," said Henrik Håkonsson Phase One President & CEO. "The Phase One XF Camera System is the new much improved standard for medium format photography, with the incorporation of significantly enhanced technology."

Makoto Honda, President of Phase One Japan, commented on the news: “Phase One Japan is committed to developing new and custom designed masterpiece leaf shutter optics in close partnership with top photographers, imaging companies and long term design partner Schneider Kreuznach.”

With the deal, Phase One has a goal of "pushing the limits for ultimate camera systems and imaging quality, meeting the demand of the world's leading photographers and industrial imaging companies."
