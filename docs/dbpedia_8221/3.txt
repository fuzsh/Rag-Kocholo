Phase One, known for its medium format digital backs and Capture One software, has purchased Mamiya’s assets after holding 45% of it shares since 2009. As part of the acquisition, the company has established Phase One Japan to oversee manufacturing operations in Japan.

Mamiya has been home to medium format camera systems for over 40 years – a ton of which are still in circulation on the second-hand market today.

With the purchase, Phase One now has all of the design and development pieces in place to independently develop all aspects of a medium format camera system. It no longer has to rely on third parties for camera body and lens development.

Phase One President Makoto Honda specifically cites the company’s commitment to developing new leaf shutter optics as part of the Phase One system.
