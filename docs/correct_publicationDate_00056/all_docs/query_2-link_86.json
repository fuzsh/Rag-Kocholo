Fine in fine price clipped dustjacket (clipped by Keyes when he gifted the book) without a single nick, or tear, no fading, aging or soiling. Fine condition is scarcer than inscribed with this book. Fine / fine. Item #964\n\nOriginally written as a short story in 1959, Keyes expanded and polished “Flowers for Algernon” to complete the novel. Keyes use an ‘uplift’ device , increasing the intelligence of a mouse and takes it a step further to mirror the transformation of his human protagonist. It’s an influential book that has been awarded, successfully adapted multiple times, challenged and banned."
