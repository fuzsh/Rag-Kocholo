        "text": "Flowers for Algernon.\n\nKEYES, Daniel.\n\nItem Number: 3821\n\nNew York: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc., 1966.\n\nFirst edition of the author’s Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novel and basis for the Oscar-winning movie adaptation Charly. Octavo, original cloth. Inscribed and dated by Daniel Keyes on the title page. Near fine in the original dust jacket which has had some professional restoration. Jacket design by Carl Smith.\n\nWith more than five million copies sold, Flowers for Algernon is the beloved, classic story of a mentally disabled man whose experimental quest for intelligence mirrors that of Algernon, an extraordinary lab mouse. In poignant diary entries, Charlie tells how a brain operation increases his IQ and changes his life. As a 1959 novella it won a Hugo Award; the 1966 novel-length expansion won a Nebula. The Oscar-winning movie adaptation Charly (1968) also spawned a 1980 Broadway musical."
