        "text": "I believe Charlie's emotions vary at different times. Before the operation Charlie was always happy and smiling, because he did not really understand when people were being mean to him. He was cheerful and laughed along with everyone else, even if they were making fun of him. Once he became intelligent, after the operation, Charlie understood that people were making fun of him, which made him sad. He could tell when people were deceiving him, and that included the doctors. Also, since his level of intelligence was higher then most others, he could not connect in conversation. Despite all of these depressing things, he saw Mrs. Kinnian as a women, and he really liked her. Since Charlie knew he was deteriorating, that made this love even worse\n\nHis mother had taught him to not look at girls, and after the operation when he started to develop more feelings, he had a hard time talking to Alice Kinnian because he had the thought that he liked her, and that he shouldn’t. Due to the hard nature of his mother, Charlie’s emotional life was not maturing with his new-found intelligence. Emotionally, he was still a little kid. “I knew she would give herself to me, and I wanted her, but what about Charlie?” Whenever he would get near Alice, he would start to panic because he felt that there was still a part of his old self within him, keeping him from taking his relationship further with\n\nCharlie would think that the best part of the operation would be the experiences and feelings he got to have. For example, Charlie and Miss Kinnian had dinner, where discussing Charlie's advancement in brain development, and the thought Charlie of passing Miss Kinnian intellectually made Charlie feel upset because he had fallen in love with her. In the story and movie, Charlie never had felt the feelings he had felt for Miss Kinnian ever before. Charlie said he thought of Miss Kinnian as genius and too old for him, he never saw her as a suitable girlfriend. As a result of the operation, Charlie would think the best part of the operation was being able to have feelings and experiences he never had before the operation. On the other hand,\n\nDarr 1 Sabrina Darr Mrs.Borba ENG-1D1 Wednesday November 29 Charlie’s Journey There is no greater journey than one must take to discover all of the mysteries that lie within. In the novel Flowers For Algernon, Charlie undergoes an operation that ultimately changes him. In the beginning Charlie is happy, and selfless in his ignorance, but eventually those emotions turn to shame and that is all Charlie is left with in the end. In the novel Flowers for Algernon, Daniel Keyes demonstrates the importance of being true to yourself, as seen through Charlie’s changes before, during, and after the operation.\n\nNature is a powerful force. According the Erik Erikson, the stages of life “is set by nature”, and that there are eight stages of human development (Erikson). The main character in the book “Flowers for Algernon” by Daniel Keyes, is a 33 year old adult named Charlies. For a long time, Charlie had an IQ of 68 making him an easy target for bullies and manipulators. Finally, the Welberg Foundation reached out to him, and after a lot of research and testing, Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur performed an operation to increase Charlie’s intelligence.\n\nFlowers for Algernon is a short fictional story that is written in the form of a journal by Charlie Gordon, a man with a clearly illustrated learning disability. In this story Charlie Gordon was picked as the first human and second test subject for an experiment that was meant to triple any ones IQ level. Dr. Strauss tells Charlie Gordon to write Progress Reports about his days and this is how the story is presented to the reader. When Charlie Gordon has his surgery that was meant to make him starter, did he actually get smarter, or does he only perceive that he gets smarter?\n\nYou feel the wetness of your sweat run down your neck and the sun beating against you. It is ninety three degrees out and you have bought yourself an ice cream. You have never tried ice cream before. When you take a lick, you feel the nice and refreshing taste of the ice cream and your body cooling. As you take another lick, you tip the icecream over and it falls on the ground. You become sad as for you only had a little taste of what you could have. Having sad thoughts as the ice cream is melting on the ground, you begin to wonder if you would be happier if you did not have the ice cream in the first place and not have this sadness that you are feeling now. This is the roller coaster of emotions that Charlie had in the science fiction short story “Flowers for Algernon” by Daniel Keyes. Charlie is a 37 year old adult who has a mental disability. He gets an opportunity to triple his IQ of only 68 from an experiment and the reader reads the journal\n\nIn the short story Flowers for Algernon, Daniel Keys is trying to tell us through the element of literature, point of view, that the theme is change. There is many pieces of evidence that show that the theme is change from the point of view aspect of the story. In the text, the element of literature, point of view, shows us through the narrator's perspective, that the theme is in fact change. Charlie shows us that through the progress reports he has written down through his change from the experiment. First of all, in the beginning of the story, Charlie is dumb and he wants to be smart.\n\nFlowers for Algernon is a novel written by Daniel Keyes; It is about a man named Charlie, 33, who has been mentally retarded all his life. Charlie gets an operation on his brain to reverse his retardation, but the experiment doesn’t last more than a couple of months. Charlies IQ raises from 67 to almost triple that. Within a few months the effects reverse and Charlie is disabled again, barely remembering that an operation even occurred. On May 25, Charlie visits Alice’s apartment. He examines the room and discovers two paintings; one being Picasso’s Mother and Child, and the other is a Renaissance painting of a courtier protecting a maiden. Though, these may seem insignificant, they represent Charlie’s goal to protect Alice and fill the missing mother role. Keyes represents this theme throughout Flowers for Algernon with memories and uncontrollable outbursts against his friends, loved ones, and himself.\n\nFlowers for Algernon/The Awakening I am doing the compare contrast of ¨The Awakening¨ and ¨Flowers for Algernon¨. Both of the story are of a medical administration or procedure that allows the recipient to become more aware of themselves and others. They both have the same idea but they are distinctly different from each other in the way that one is a mental incapability and the other is of disease related and many other things. In ¨Flowers for Algernon¨ the procedure is of surgical means but in ¨The Awakening¨ is works by chemical stimulation of the brain. I believe they both have the same idea and a couple of the stories end alike\n\nHumans are human; all people change in one way or the other over the course of certain events. Some of the changes people experience may cause them to have a sad outlook on certain matters, others may cause people to have a positive outlook on a matter. Just like all other humans, Charlie, from Daniel Keyes’ “Flowers For Algernon” changes over some time too. His life drastically changes after he gets surgery to alter his intelligence level. In Daniel Keyes’ “Flowers For Algernon,” Charlie becomes a different person over the course of events. His most significant changes include his mentality towards certain people and his attitude, and also the sudden regression of his mental health after his surgery."
