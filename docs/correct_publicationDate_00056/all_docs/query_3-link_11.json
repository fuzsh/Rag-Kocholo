        "text": "Flowers for Algernon Characters\n\nCharlie\n\nCharlie Gordon is the protagonist of this story. He is a young, mentally disabled man who is kind and good-hearted and harbors a deep desire to become smart so he can become popular. He undergoes brain surgery which makes him a lot more intelligent than most people. However, this Charlie is bitter, angry, and despises his old self. He makes a lot of progress and wins accolades for his mental prowess and academic research but he is a lonely man. Charlie loses his mental abilities and as he declines into his old self, he is back to becoming likeable, helpful and popular. Charlie’s character embodies the impact of ambition versus acceptance of one’s fate.\n\nAlgernon\n\nAlgernon is a mouse used for a brain experiment to enhance intelligence. Although he is merely a rodent, he plays an important role in Charlie’s life and is a mirror for Charlie’s own life and self.\n\nProfessor Nemur\n\nOne of the scientists behind the brain experiment, Professor Nemur is a rude man who only cares about his own success and does not really consider Charlie a human being. Although he is a brilliant academic, he lacks sorely in empathy and understanding human behavior.\n\nDr Strauss\n\nHe is a psychotherapist who is perhaps one of the most empathetic people in Charlie’s life. He is crucial to Charlie’s development and is always kind and understanding toward Charlie. His therapy sessions help Charlie unearth a lot about himself and his memories.\n\nMiss Alice Kinnian\n\nCharlie’s former teacher, she has a deep fondness for him and they eventually fall in love. It is a problematic relationship as the old Charlie is deeply respectful of her and the new Charlie is desirous of her.\n\nMr Donner\n\nThe boss at the bakery, Mr Donner helps Charlie remain independent and magnanimously also takes him back into his fold when Charlie’s mental decline begins. He is a compassionate man and a keen businessman, who is honest and fair to everyone around him.\n\nFay\n\nFay is the only girlfriend Charlie ever has and the first woman he sleeps with. She is a carefree young woman who helps the smart Charlie relax and accept that people can be different."
