        "text": "It’s been a while since I read Daniel Keyes’ Flowers for Algernon. I’ve read it many times—the first time was in eighth grade, when my English class read a play version that had so much cut out and censored that in retrospect I wonder why we bothered—and it has always been one of my favorite modern classics. It is always interesting to reread novels at different ages, because different things stand out with each reading.\n\nSummary: What’s it about?\n\nCharlie has an uncommonly low IQ but a longs to be smart, so when his teacher from his college for retarded adults recommends Charlie for an experimental surgery that will make him smart, he is eager for the procedure even though it has never been tested on a human before, just on animals like Algernon, a mouse that is the study’s major success story. Charlie chronicles his experiences in a series of progris riports progress reports as his intelligence skyrockets and he begins to experience life from an entirely new perspective.\n\nReview: What’d I think this time?\n\nThe writing in Flowers for Algernon is amazing. Charlie’s voice is painfully authentic, and his intellectual growth is depicted incredibly. Charlie’s voice is the best part of the book. When Charlie is at his lowest mentally, his writing is childishly innocent, full of errors and simple ideas. As Charlie gets more and more intelligent, his innocence sharpens to cynicism and both the mechanics and the content of his writing gets more sophisticated. The novel is structured as though it is Charlie’s progress reports for the experiment, which gives the novel very clean edges. The writing is masterful throughout.\n\nThe professed morality of the novel didn’t sit with me particularly well this time around, and that is due in large part to the character Alice Kinnian, the teacher who recommended Charlie for the experiment. Alice is portrayed as a kind, intelligent woman; the fact that she is only briefly Charlie’s intellectual equal is tragic. At least, that’s how I remember reading her character every previous time I read this book. This time, Alice creeped me out a little. Charlie is very emotionally immature. Developmentally he is a child compared to Alice, and even when he is as smart as or smarter than her intellectually, there is a power imbalance. Charlie thinks he’s in love with Alice. Maybe he even is. But it still feels like Alice takes advantage of him and even though Charlie feels strongly that he has to overcome all his childhood issues in order to be with Alice, being with Alice doesn’t strike me as a worthy or healthy goal. Strangely, I remember thinking that Charlie and Alice’s relationship was tragically romantic almost every other time I read this book.\n\nAlice is also pretty hypocritical. She criticizes Charlie when, smart enough to realize that his “friends” only kept him around to make fun of him, he closes himself off and becomes disillusioned about the world. She acts like Charlie is an ungrateful bastard for not being as sweetly loving as he was before the operation. Seriously? That’s what happens when you realize you’ve been betrayed by the people you thought had your back: you don’t trust as easily. It’s even worse when you consider how upset Alice gets at Charlie when he advances past her and she perceives that he is condescending to her. Apparently Charlie is supposed to smile when people mock him for his lack of understanding, but he’s supposed to be patient with Alice when she’s the one who doesn’t understand. Apparently Charlie is not allowed to be upset.\n\nThe scientists err by acting like Charlie only becomes a human being when he becomes intelligent. Alice saw Charlie as a human being, but she never accepts that he is a human being entitled to his own emotions. She fully accepts him only when he is wholly positive, but that positivity is borne from the inability to think for himself and make his own decisions. Is that really acceptance?\n\nI don’t know. Maybe I’ve gotten too cynical. Or maybe Keyes didn’t want us to love Alice the way that Charlie does. Charlie is not a reliable narrator.\n\nCharlie’s weird hyperfocus on sex stood out to me more this time around. He does some pervy stuff, like regularly watching a naked neighbor through her window and obsessing about how he needs to make love to Alice. I think the point is probably that Charlie’s mother messed him up about sex by trying to break him of any possible sexual drive, but it’s still a little disturbing.\n\nNone of the characters in Flowers for Algernon are totally good or totally bad people, which makes for an excellent and morally dubious read. What are we meant to think of men who work to make life better for people with intellectual disabilities but who simultaneously deny their humanity? What are we meant to think of the man who defends Charlie from his tormentors but who uses him to steal?\n\nThe novel opens up some really interesting conversations about emotional and intellectual maturity. There aren’t many protagonists like Charlie, and the focus on his humanity—both before and after the surgery—is quite beautiful.\n\nWhat’s the verdict?\n\nFlowers for Algernon wreaks havoc on the emotions. It is heartbreaking, but the writing is so amazing that it’s the good kind of heartbreaking. If you haven’t read this one, you should. It’s not long, but it is a whirlwind of emotions, and it is a story that definitely sticks with a person. Report card: A"
