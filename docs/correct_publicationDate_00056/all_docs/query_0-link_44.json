What if it meant you wouldnâ€™t be the same person anymore, would you still do it?\n\nThatâ€™s the premise of Flowers for Algernon, a brilliant story by Daniel Keyes. Except, in the book, such an experiment isnâ€™t available to you or me. The scientists in the book decide to try their thesis on a man with very low IQ.\n\nFrom the ratâ€™s mouth\n\nThe story is told in first person, through Charlieâ€™s personal diary. Charlie is a grown-up man in his early-thirties who has what I would consider a fulfilling life, albeit having a very low IQ.\n\nOf course, having an intellectual disability limits Charlieâ€™s life in several ways. But at the beginning of the story, heâ€™s an incredibly likeable character, and his determination to better himself is inspiring.\n\nLike most humans, Charlie isnâ€™t completely satisfied with his life, and there are things he would like to change. Heâ€™s aware of his intellectual disability, and his biggest wish is to become smarter. So, itâ€™s not a surprise heâ€™s reallyâ€¦"
