        "text": "'Flowers for Algernon' author Daniel Keyes dies\n\nDaniel Keyes, the author of the popular 1966 novel, Flowers for Algernon, died Sunday at his home in Florida. He was 86.\n\nKeyes originally published Flowers for Algernon as a short story in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1959. It is narrated by Charlie Gordon, a young man with an IQ of 68 who cannot even spell his own name. Charlie undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence, first performed on the mouse Algernon with apparent success. Charlie becomes a genius, only to lose everything when the process reverses itself.\n\nKeyes won the Hugo Award for the short story in 1960, and a Nebula Award in 1966 for the expanded novel. The story was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film starring Cliff Robertson in 1968.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1927, Keyes got his start as the editor of Marvel Science Stories, later writing comics himself and working under Stan Lee. After the success of Flowers for Algernon, Keyes taught at Ohio University. He also continued writing books, including The Fifth Sally, The Minds of Billy Milligan, Unveiling Claudia, and his memoir, Algernon, Charlie, and I: A Writer's Journey."
