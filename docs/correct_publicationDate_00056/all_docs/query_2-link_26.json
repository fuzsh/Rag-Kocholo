        "text": "Flowers for Algernon is a book written by Daniel Keyes in 1960.\n\nThe main character of the book is Charlie Gordon, an unintelligent but lovable person. Charlie is used in part of a new experiment to triple his IQ. He becomes intelligent, and learns to read and enjoy the world around him better. But later, people stop liking him as much because he makes them feel bad. He learns that it is more important to be a good person than a smart person. He frequents a class for feeble minded folks taught by a teacher named Miss Kinnian. While Charlie's IQ grows so does his love for her. He finds himself in a state of depression, unhappy and unsatisfied with his new artificial IQ.\n\nThe title of the book comes from a mouse in the story named Algernon who also has the experiment done on him."
