        "text": "Daniel Keyes, the writer of Flowers for Algernon, which was turned into the Oscar-winning film Charly, has died aged 86.\n\nThe 1958 book, about a mentally disabled man who undergoes treatment to increase his intelligence, won a Nebula science fiction award.\n\nCliff Robertson won best actor at the 1969 Oscars for the playing Charly Gordon in the film version.\n\nKeyes died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Leslie said., external\n\nThe author was born in New York City in 1927 and briefly attended university before joining the US Maritime Service aged 17.\n\nAfter leaving, he returned to his studies and, in 1950, gained a bachelors degree in psychology.\n\nUpon graduation, Keyes became a science fiction magazine editor and worked under Spider-Man creator Stan Lee, before becoming a full-time writer for Entertaining Comics.\n\nAccording to his autobiography, Flowers for Algernon stemmed from a short, one-paragraph synopsis for a story called Brainstorm.\n\nThe eponymous Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence. The story is told by a series of progress reports written by menial worker Charlie Gordon, the first human test subject for the surgery.\n\nWith an initial IQ of just 68 Charlie sees his intelligence grow to 185 in a few short months, surpassing his friends, colleagues and even the scientists who worked with him on the treatment.\n\nBut when Algernon begins to regress suddenly, Charlie realises the same will happen to him."
