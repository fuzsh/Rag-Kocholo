        "text": "Flowers for Algernon is a novel written by Daniel Keyes and first published in 1966. It was originally a short story and, in the year 2000, was adapted into a film of the same name. There are no direct references to the time period in which the story takes place, but it’s safe to assume that the events take place around the time the novel was written; the mid-1960s. In this novel, there are two primary settings, the main character’s room, where he writes in his journal, and the hospital, where he undergoes surgery and various examinations.

I had often been pursued up that long, narrow staircase by demons who grabbed at my legs and pulled me down into the cellar below, while I tried to scream without a voice, straggling on my tongue and gagging in silence.” (Allegory) “…the switch that sets the huge machine humming.” (Personification) “His eyebrows came down like shutters…\" (Simile) “I was scared to death of ink blots.” (Hyperbole) “I felt boxed in by my obligations.” (Metaphor) “…realize Algernon and I have been found missing.” (Oxymoron) “Sleeping comes so naturally to me, I could do it with my eyes closed.” (Pun) “…I just thought he was a magic mouse is all.” (Alliteration) Charlie Gordan is the protagonist and author of the progress reports that the novel is composed of. He is a thirty-two-year-old mentally retarded man with an IQ of 68 who lives in New York City. At the start of the novel, he works at Donner’s Bakery as a janitor and delivery boy. Charlie’s desire to learn compounded with his low self-esteem render him the best student in Alice Kinnian’s reading class at the Beekman College Center for Retarded Adults. Charlie undergoes an experimental surgery to boost his intelligence. His IQ triples and his intelligence"
