        "text": "There's been a lot of mention on the science fiction forums recently of Daniel Keyes, the non-very-prolific author of Flowers for Algernon, one of his rare science fiction appearances, published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. This story was made into a film. What else does he write or do? This interview was done some time back and answers these questions.\n\nDaniel Keyes: My interest in science fiction has always been from the perspective of the individual character. I am interested in the human mind as it reacts to a complex and industrialized society. My chief interest is in neurosis and psychosis and the multiple personality, as it is used as a defense mechanism. Child abuse is particularly prominent in the woes of an industrialized civilization and in this syndrome: the child reacts to the abuse of complex society with multiple personalities.\n\nQuestion: I'm sure your style is controversial and raises issues, some of these particularized and others vital. Flowers for Algernon was such an apocalyptic story that it prompts me to ask you whether you got any adverse reactions to the story.\n\nKeyes: I haven't heard a single one. I have gotten thousands of letters about it and they all had favorable thoughts to express. The story has been in four and a half million paperback editions and is used in high schools and colleges across the land. In all of this not a single unfavorable reaction has arrived.\n\nQuestion: Has all this kept you pretty busy?\n\nKeyes: Lately, mostly I've been promoting my new book. It's published by Random House and out in PB in a Bantam edition. It's called THE MINDS OF BILLY MILLIGAN and is about a man with twenty-four personalities. It came up 13 th on the New York Times best seller list. Also I've got another book called The Touch, a novel about a radioactive accident describing the effect of a radiation spill on a young couple. This makes it interesting and it was made into a movie; the person involved is Larry Lineville, an actor on MASH who plays Major Burns, and he took out an option on the film rights.\n\nQuestion: I shall have to see that if it comes aroundin line with your getting a lot of action, I wondered if you have been doing any lecturing, for example at colleges.\n\nKeyes: I am with a lecture bureau called the Greater Talent Network and have lectured at fifteen colleges. My main topic is the impact of the human mind in the complexities of today's society.\n\nQuestion: How did you like the televised version of Flowers for Algernon?\n\nKeyes: I liked it. I think they did a pretty good job. I think you heard of the movie also, it was quite well made, and there's an interesting story about it, Clifton Webb, he's the fellow that played in it, and as they were making it into a movie, he was in that, played the sensitive fellow Charlie, I asked him how he managed to keep the character interesting in the transition, there was a compromise happy ending where he was turned upward and getting intelligent again, in the televised version they were going to use that, and it ran right up to the end and was cut off by the production manager, just before the upgrade, and the ending stayed just as it was, so it was a successful performance of the actual story.\n\nQuestion: I imagine that really left a lot of people frozen I assume you would not want a happy ending substituted for the original.\n\nKeyes: Oh, I wouldn't say exactly, everybody tries or was trying to make that ending into a happy ending.\n\nQuestion: Well, he has learned a lot from having the experience.\n\nKeyes: Yes. It's a good enough experience.\n\nQuestion: I thought it was good enough but it had a somber effect. Everybody from THE GODS OF MARS on hasn't been too specific about their happier moments.\n\nKeyes: In line with the productions, on television that was known as THE TWO WORLDS OF CHARLIE GORDON, then in the movie it was just CHARLIE, and they had alternate titles which weren't used; the TV production was THE UNITED STATES STEEL HOUR, it took seven years to make the movie of CHARLIE; then there was also a dramatic musical on Broadway made by the author of ANNIE and it played there and went to England where it was CHARLIE AND ALGERNON, that played around quite a bit. THE TOUCH was also made into a movie.\n\nQ: What do you think about the science fiction field in general, are you very familiar with it?\n\nKeyes: I have, actually, been the editor of a science fiction magazine, Marvel Science Stories, which I edited for a year and a half. Also, Flowers for Algernon was not my first, but my fifth science fiction story. The others are Robot Unwanted, from Other Worlds , June 1952, Precedent, from Marvel, May 1952, Something Borrowed, from Fantastic Stories , Summer 1952, Trouble with Elmo, Galaxy , August 1958, and after Flowers for Algernon there was Crazy Marrow, F&SF , April 1960, Quality of Mercy, If , November 1960, and A Jury of Its Peers, Worlds of Tomorrow , August 1963."
