        "text": "Background\n\nThe ideas for Flowers for Algernon developed over 14 years and were inspired by events in Keyes's life, starting in 1945 with Keyes's conflict with his parents who were pushing him through a pre-medical education despite his desire to pursue a writing career. Keyes felt that his education was driving a wedge between him and his parents, and this led him to wonder what would happen if it were possible to increase a person's intelligence.[5][9][10][11]\n\nA pivotal moment occurred in 1957 while Keyes was teaching English to students with special needs; one of them asked him if it would be possible to be put into a regular class if he worked hard and became smart.[5][11][12] Keyes also witnessed the dramatic change in another learning-disabled student who regressed after he was removed from regular lessons. Keyes said that \"When he came back to school, he had lost it all. He could not read. He reverted to what he had been. It was a heart-breaker.\"[5]\n\nCharacters in the book were based on people in Keyes's life. The character of Algernon was inspired by a university dissection class, and the name was inspired by the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne.[11] Nemur and Strauss, the scientists who develop the intelligence-enhancing surgery in the story, were based on professors Keyes met while studying psychoanalysis in graduate school.[11]\n\nIn 1958, Keyes was approached by Galaxy Science Fiction magazine to write a story, at which point the elements of Flowers for Algernon fell into place.[11] When the story was submitted to Galaxy, however, editor Horace Gold suggested changing the ending so that Charlie retained his intelligence, married Alice Kinnian, and lived happily ever after.[11][13]Keyes refused to make the change and sold the story to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction instead.[11]\n\nKeyes worked on the expanded novel between 1962 and 1965[14] and first tried to sell it to Doubleday, but they also wanted to change the ending. Again, Keyes refused and gave Doubleday back their advance.[13] Five publishers rejected the story over the course of a year[13] until it was published by Harcourt in 1966.\n\nPublication history[edit]\n\nThe short story \"Flowers for Algernon\" was first published as the lead story in the April 1959 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction.[11] It was later reprinted in The Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction, 9th series (1960),[4][15] the Fifth Annual of the Year’s Best Science Fiction (1960),[4][16] Best Articles and Stories (1961),[4] Literary Cavalcade(1961),[4] The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964 (1970),[17] and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction: A 30-Year Retrospective (1980).[15]\n\nThe expanded novel was first published in 1966 by Harcourt Brace with the Bantam paperback following in 1968.[4] By 2004, it had been translated into 27 languages, published in 30 countries and sold more than 5 million copies.[18] Since its original publication, the novel has never been out of print.[13]\n\nSynopsis[edit]\n\nThe short story and the novel share many similar plot points, but the novel expands significantly on Charlie's developing emotional state as well as his intelligence, his memories of childhood, and the relationship with his family.\n\nShort story[edit]\n\nThe story is told through a series of journal entries written by the story's protagonist, Charlie Gordon, a man with a low IQ of 68 who works a menial job as a janitor in Donnegan's Plastic Box Company. He is selected to undergo an experimental surgical technique to increase his intelligence. The technique had already been successfully tested on Algernon, a laboratory mouse. The surgery on Charlie is also a success, and his IQ more than doubles.\n\nHe realizes his co-workers at the factory, who he thought were his friends, only liked him around so they could tease him. His new intelligence scares his co-workers, and they start a petition to have him fired, but when Charlie learns about the petition, he quits. As Charlie's intelligence peaks, Algernon's suddenly declines—he loses his increased intelligence and mental age, and dies afterward, buried in the back yard of Charlie's home. Charlie realizes his intelligence increase is also temporary. He starts to experiment to find the cause of the flaw in the experiment, which he calls the \"Algernon–Gordon Effect\". When he finishes his experiments, his intelligence regresses to its original state. Charlie is aware of, and pained by, what is happening to him as he loses his knowledge and his ability to read and write. He tries to earn back his old job as a janitor, and tries to revert to normal, but he cannot stand the pity from his co-workers, landlady, and Ms. Kinnian. Charlie states he plans to \"go away\" from New York and move to a new place. His last wish is for someone to put flowers on Algernon's grave.\n\nNovel[edit]\n\nThe novel opens with an epigraph taken from Book VII of Plato's The Republic:\n\nAnyone who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eye are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye.\n\nCharlie Gordon, 32 years old, lives with phenylketonuria and demonstrates an IQ of 68. His uncle has arranged for him to hold a menial job at a bakery so that he will not have to live in a state institution. Desiring to improve himself, Charlie attends reading and writing classes at the Beekman College Center for Retarded Adults; his teacher is Miss Alice Kinnian. Two researchers at Beekman, Dr. Nemur and Dr. Strauss, are looking for a human test subject on whom to try a new surgical technique intended to increase intelligence. They have already performed the surgery on a mouse named Algernon, resulting in a dramatic improvement in his mental performance. Based on Alice's recommendation and his motivation to improve, Nemur and Strauss choose Charlie over smarter pupils to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe operation is a success, and within the next three months Charlie's IQ reaches 185. However, as his intelligence, education, and understanding of the world increase, his relationships with people deteriorate. His co-workers at the bakery, who used to amuse themselves at his expense, now fear and resent his increased intelligence and persuade his boss to fire him. Later, Charlie confronts his scientific mentors about their condescending attitude toward him, particularly Dr. Nemur, because Charlie believed Dr. Nemur considered him a mere laboratory subject and not human before the operation.\n\nWhen not drinking at night, Charlie spends weeks continuing his mentors' research and writing reports which include observations of Algernon, whom he keeps at his apartment. Charlie's research discovers a flaw in the theory behind Nemur and Strauss's intelligence-enhancing procedure that could cause him to revert to his original mental state. His conclusions prove true when Algernon starts behaving erratically, loses his own enhanced intelligence, and dies.\n\nCharlie tries to mend the long-broken relationships with his parents. He remembers as a boy his mother insisted on his institutionalization, overruling his father's wish to keep him in the household. His mother, who still lives in the family's old home in Brooklyn, has developed dementia and recognizes him only briefly; his father, who broke off contact with the family years earlier, does not recognize him at all. He is only able to reconnect with his now-friendly younger sister, Norma, who had hated him for his mental disability when they were growing up, and is now caring for their mother in their newly depressed neighborhood. When Norma asks Charlie to stay with his family, he refuses but promises to send her money.\n\nDespite regressing to his former self, he remembers he was once a genius. He cannot bear to have his friends and co-workers pity him. He decides to live at the state-sponsored Warren Home School, where nobody knows about the operation. In a final postscript to his writings, he requests that someone put some flowers on Algernon's grave in Charlie's former backyard.\n\nStyle\n\nBoth the novel and the short story are written in an epistolary style collecting together Charlie's personal \"progress reports\" from a few days before the operation until his final regression. Initially, the reports are filled with spelling errors and awkwardly constructed sentences.[19] Following the operation, however, the first signs of Charlie's increased intelligence are his improved accuracy in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.[20][21] Charlie's regression is conveyed by the loss of these skills.[20]\n\nThemes\n\nImportant themes in Flowers for Algernon include the treatment of the mentally disabled,[4][5][22] the impact on happiness of the conflict between intellect and emotion,[21][23][24] and how events in the past can influence a person later in life.[24] Algernon is an example of a story that incorporates the science-fiction theme of uplift.[25]\n\nReception\n\nAlgis Budrys of Galaxy Science Fiction praised Flowers for Algernon's realistic depiction of people as \"rounded characters\". Stating in August 1966 that Keyes had published little fiction and whether he would publish more was unknown, he concluded \"If this is a beginning, then what a beginning it is, and if it is the high point in a very short career, then what a career\".[26] In February 1967 Budrys named the book the best novel of the year.[27]\n\nAwards\n\nThe original short story won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1960.[2] The expanded novel was joint winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966, tied with Babel-17 by Samuel R. Delany,[3] and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967, losing out to The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein.[28]\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) decided to give Nebula Awards retroactively and voted for their favourite science fiction stories of the era ending December 31, 1964 (before the Nebula Award was conceived). The short story version of Flowers for Algernon was voted third out of 132 nominees and was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964 in 1970.[29] Keyes was elected the SFWA Author Emeritus in 2000 for making a significant contribution to science fiction and fantasy, primarily as a result of Flowers for Algernon.[30]"
