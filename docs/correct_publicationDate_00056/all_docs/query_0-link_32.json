        "text": "Don't Even Debate It, Just Click \"Add to Cart\"\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThe story and narration were superb and the plot was engrossing. After listening to about 60+ nonfiction books I have started to dip my toes into fiction--particularly science fiction. I remember listening to a classmate give a review of this book in a high school English class and decided to use one of the 'ol two credits on this one. Smart decision. Even though I knew the ending before I hit the play button, the journey--as any good book reveals--is more important that mere facts.\n\nThe ending will hit you.\n\nserious but interesting\n\nThis story is not light and entertaining, but I am glad that I listened to it. It really did make me think about how society sees persons with mental challenges, or any types of handicaps or differences for that matter. It also said a lot about how important companionship and friendships are. Don't expect to feel better after listening to this book - it's not a feel-good book - but I think it's worth listening to.\n\nMASTERPIECE\n\nNot an easy listen, but so worthwhile! Maybe the second listen will be better because one knows where it's going. I was not comfortable listening. Things could have gone so many ways. Still, heartbreaking, unforgettable and beautifully written. Jeff Woodman is marvelous.\n\nFabulous Story!\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to Flowers for Algernon the most enjoyable?\n\nI loved this story and the Narrator did an amazing job.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Flowers for Algernon?\n\nI will remember the overall story for a long time to come.\n\nHave you listened to any of Jeff Woodman’s other performances before? How does this one compare?\n\nNo\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYes\n\nA bit depressing\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nProbably not to most people. Most of my friends would find this book depressing in spite of the compelling nature of the story.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Flowers for Algernon to and why?\n\nI can't think of another book but I might compare it to the movie Awakenings.\n\nWhat does Jeff Woodman bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nThe way the main character's voice changes as he changes isn't something I would have really considered probably if I was reading the story. It probably enhanced the story to have those verbal cues.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nNo. The plot was compelling but not in the kind of way that kept me from putting it down. I already had a good idea of how it would end.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nIt's a story that did make me think and the plot was compelling but I felt kind of depressed about it when I was finished.\n\nSad...\n\nI wanted to love it, but to me it was a rollercoaster of sad, hopeful, elated, scared and worried, then ending in bittersweet sadness.\n\nFantastic narration of an essential classic\n\nThe narrator here did a sensational job with this piece. The story itself was incredible, but this reading took it to another level.\n\nold favorite.\n\nI'm writing this review after my third time finishing the book, it never fails to make me tear up in the final chapter.\n\nIntriguing, sad, funny and thought provoking\n\nWould you listen to Flowers for Algernon again? Why?\n\nNo. I don't reread books. Not often anyway, I first read this in 1969.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nBoth\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nWorth a listen. The setting in time and place comes to life.\n\nA classic.\n\nMy husband suffered brain damage a few years ago. He went from a highly educated man to the mentality of a five year old. When recently asked to describe the way he changed, I thought of the movie made from this book. Listening to this book now (2019) has given me a new perspective and insight into his frustration. Thank you. A great story. Timeless."
