What is more intuitive than the human touch? Thatâs what inspired Cirqueâs founder almost 30 years ago to provide a better interface solution using capacitive touch technology. At the time trackballs and joysticks for laptops were ok, but using your own fingers to perform simple or complex navigation task was even cooler. So Cirque invented the GlidePointÂ® Trackpad that has now proven to be a very reliable and versatile user interface for decades. Cirque continues to push the innovation envelope today by providing customers with both custom and standardized solutions for notebook touchpads, VR gaming accessories, secure point of sales touch screens, and proximity sensing capabilities. In 2003, Cirque became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alps Electric Co., Ltd. (6770:JP). In addition to our own products, Cirque functions as an ALPS R&D center for capacitive sensing. Working together with ALPS Electric allows us to refining existing products and introduce Cirqueâs capacitive touch technology into countless new applications that improves both the form and function of human interface platforms.
