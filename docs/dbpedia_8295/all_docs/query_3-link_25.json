        "text": "New trackpad products for notebooks and Ultrabooks available for demonstration\n\nTOKYO, May 31, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Alps Electric today announced its latest notebook trackpad products and solutions will be available for demonstration during COMPUTEX Taipei 2012. Alps' demonstrations will include its patented GlidePoint® NFC trackpad, EdgeAction™ gestures for Windows® 8, and new GlidePoint trackpads with integrated buttons.\n\nGlidePoint NFC gives ODMs and OEMs a solution for notebooks and Ultrabooks that will work with new Windows 8 NFC \"Tap and Do\" features. GlidePoint NFC provides an easily discoverable interaction point for communication between PC and other NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablets. For Ultrabooks with all-metal casings, GlidePoint NFC is the ideal solution to implement near field communication technology. Alps' GlidePoint NFC trackpad is based on Cirque Corporation's patented integration of an NFC antenna and a touch sensor (US Patent 7,306,144 and patents pending).\n\nEdgeAction gestures provide users an effortless ability to manipulate the new Metro interface in Windows 8 using a GlidePoint trackpad. These new gestures build upon Alps' standard gesture suite that includes two, three, and four finger gestures. Furthermore, GlidePoint trackpads include precise single-finger tracking, TouchGuard™ palm rejection technology, and industry-leading noise immunity.\n\nGlidePoint trackpads with integrated buttons offer a high-performance solution that overcomes many usability issues prevalent in existing buttonless products. Common usability problems that exist are poor cursoring and misrecognition of gestures due to a resting finger in button zones. Alps' GlidePoint trackpad overcomes these and other issues, providing a reliable user experience.\n\nAlps Electric is a leading global manufacturer of electronic devices, supplying some 40,000 components to over 2,000 companies worldwide.
