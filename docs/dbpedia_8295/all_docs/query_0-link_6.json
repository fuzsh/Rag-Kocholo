Thatâs what inspired Cirqueâs founder almost 30 years ago to provide a better interface solution using capacitive touch technology.

Cirque continues to push the innovation envelope today by providing customers with both custom and standardized solutions for notebook touchpads, VR gaming accessories, secure point of sales touch screens, and proximity sensing capabilities. In 2003, Cirque became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alps Electric Co., Ltd. (6770:JP). In addition to our own products, Cirque functions as an ALPS R&D center for capacitive sensing.
