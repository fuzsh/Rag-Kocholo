        "text": "Company Description:\n\nCriminals want to gain trusted status and go undetected. This makes keys and certificates a prime target, which are blindly trusted by most of today's Global 5000 enterprises. Criminals steal and compromise keys and certificates that are not properly protected, and use them to circumvent security controls-to hide in encrypted traffic, deploy malware, and steal data. these uniquely identify webservers, software, mobile devices, apps, admins, and even airplanes This has become the attack of choice. Current security controls are being undermined. Compromised SSL/TLS, SSH and mobile certificates and keys undermine data loss prevention, next-gen firewalls, strong authentication, sandboxing and other security systems. Attackers 1) mask their true identity using keys and certificates and 2) hide their actions by encrypting data which means you can't look inside for threats. Protecting keys and certificates eliminates both of these blind spots and makes all security systems stronger. Venafi finds all keys and certificates and puts them under surveillance to detect anomalies, and learns and adapts as it works. Venafi identifies what keys and certificates are trusted and those that need to be replaced. It keeps keys and certificates secured to your policy and replaces them automatically. From stopping certificate-based outages to enabling SSL inspection, Venafi creates an ever-evolving, intelligent response that protects your network, your business, and your brand.\n\nShow More\n\nCompany Description:\n\nCatalyst is solving healthcare data warehouse issues for some of the nation's top health systems.
