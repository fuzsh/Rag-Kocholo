        "text": "Welcome to the Chris Millar Quotes File!\n\nChris Millar wrote about Magic: the Gathering for the wonderful House of Cards column on www.magicthegathering.com from January 2006 to August 2008, and his sense of humour tends to the bizarre and surreal, as do his decks. This file is just a collection of some of his most insane moments.\n\nYou can see a list of all the articles Chris has written for Wizards here.\n\nThis file is maintained by Alex Churchill / alextfish, who also created the random Magic card generator and contributes to several other silly threads about Magic.\n\nNow, on with the quotes!\n\nIt's Just Dumb:\n\nI have to say, it's nice to finally upgrade this old House of Cards to a proper laboratory. I mean, who ever heard of mad science and bizarre experiments being conducted in a house (outside of my fridge)? Mad vacuuming, sure. Mad dinner parties, obviously. But mad science? That requires a less-inviting space, decorated with unlabeled jars containing mysterious fluids, open flames, strange devices crackling with electricity, and adequate living space for a grotesque assistant.\n\nI got to talking with my friend Greg, a guy who can't say no to life-gain and who also happens to enjoy thwarting my well-laid plans with the unluckliest of tricks (I'm looking at you, Razor Barrier!). We talked about our lives, our careers, his new baby, and how the \"married life\" was treating him... for about five seconds. We quickly turned our attention to more important things, like making 500 Rat tokens and 400/400 creatures.\n\nIt starts with Boon Reflection, naturally. Well, \"naturally\" if you're Greg. It isn't a game of Magic if he doesn't need a calculator to track his life total.\n\nSurely, though, getting all ten of the \"God Auras\" on a Reaper King is impossible, right? Well, we'll see about that. After all, to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd. And, once again, this is just dumb (but in a good way).\n\nAnd Chris ended his final regular article for magicthegathering.com with a list of thanks, in which list I was somewhat startled to spot:\n\nto alextfish, for keeping my spirits up\n\nYou're extremely welcome, Chris, and I could say the same many times over to you!\n\nThree Letters:\n\nWelcome to Elf Week! Can you think of a better time to dip into the old mailbag? I can, but that would mean I'd have to rewrite the previous sentence. Never look back!\n\n\"I have neither a surname nor a job title, making me a lot like Bjork, Bono, and other Earth Elves you are probably familiar with.\n\nI am writing on behalf of all the other made-up Elves to thank you for your continued dedication to Elfkind and your tireless efforts in Elf-advocacy.\"\n\nI made a mental note of its existence and combotacularity, but like Magic's Mental Notes, it ended up in the bin with a bunch of other cards.\n\nMarriage Return:\n\nthe Magic players I know are banding with others (i.e. getting married).\n\nMr. \"Jolly\" Rogers, whose goals in life include getting namedropped in an article on this site and eventually settling down with a nice girl who loves playing Vintage (Well, at least one of those things is going to happen).\n\nI took off my jacket, loosened my tie, rolled up my sleeves, and proceeded to shake what is, nominally, my groove thang. If you've ever seen So You Think You Can Dance, you will have a good idea of what I didn't look like. Rugs were cut, moves were busted, and, as far as I can tell, my reputation survived an embarrassing display that can be fairly accurately described as C-3PO crossed with a boxing kangaroo.\n\nI don't know about you, but I find it rather annoying when I play a Marshdrinker Giant and nothing happens. With Streambed Aquitects' ability to make Islands out of everyday household materials (like Forests), you'll never have this problem again!\n\nIn perhaps the most unlikely alliance, Hatchet Bully and Woeleecher combine to make mini Lightning Helixes for a mere !\n\nThe good thing about this combo is that it features many more tentacles.\n\nIf there's one thing red creatures love more than barreling headlong into the red zone, it's not being able to do so because of some crippling psychological issue. How else can you explain this sad-sack bunch of excuse-makers? Okk, Orgg, Veteran Brawlers, Mijae Djinn, Goblin Goon, Lesser Gargadon...\n\nEventidal:\n\nHowdy, folks! As some of you might be aware, a new expansion set for the collectable card game known as Magic: The Gathering has just been pre-released. Its name is Eventide, and it takes place in a dark and mysterious land full of cantankerous old ladies and mischievous donkey-headed people. It's basically Anytown, USA, but with talking donkeys.\n\nIt has some pretty cool things going on inside of it, too, just like your body! Also like your body, you won't be able to play with it for a couple weeks. At least, that's how my doctor explained it to me.\n\nI'll go out on a limb and suggest that everybody likes a wombat. I mean, how could you not? While they might sound like one of the silliest creatures ever invented, they are, in fact, the most cunning and lethal of all the subterranean marsupials. They are completely adorable, and yet, if provoked, they will dig a tunnel and then poop a cube on your lawn without the slightest hint of remorse. They are even crepuscular! I don't know what that means, but frankly, it sounds terrifying. On top of all these vaguely sinister, but totally true, Wikipedia-vetted attributes, the magical wombat also likes to wear pants. Lots of pants. I don't know how they do it with those short little legs of theirs, but like poodles in sweaters and chimps in tutus, these wombats can't get enough of the pants-wearing. The fatter the pants, the better.\n\nThe latest non-Wombat wombat, Evershrike, puts on its pants just like the rest of us: one leg at a time. Except, once its pants are on, it kills your opponent with a series of aerial strikes. Even better, fallen Evershrikes can will themselves back to life provided there is suitable legwear available. Now that's dedication to fashion. But which pants do we pick? Well, I'm pretty sure Evershrike was born to be played Edge of the Divinity. Born, hatched, or brought by the Everstork; it doesn't matter.\n\nThe last aura that I included is Mantle of Leadership. On its own, it isn't that exciting. Evershrike will become a 4/4 flier (with the chance to get much larger) for an initial investment of seven mana. Kind of blah. What makes it less blah, and, frankly, what makes anything less blah, are all the Goats!\n\nSpringjack Pasture further smooths the flow of Goats from the aether to your kitchen table.\n\nI have a little rule of thumb when it comes to evaluating Magic cards: If it costs 101 mana, it had better win you the game. I hope we can all agree on that statement. Of course, until the release of Helix Pinnacle that rule was never really put to the test.\n\nIt isn't the first card that takes triple-digit mana to kill an opponent by itself. Both Searing Touch and Death of a Thousand Stings could already make that particular claim.\n\nOne, if you need 101 mana to win the game, you'd better include some ways to generate a lot of mana. I learned that one the hard way. Two, if you're going to try to win the game with a 101-mana spell, it would be wise to avoid dying while you're still paying for it. That's as true in Magic as it is in life.\n\nOupherkill:\n\nWe're nearing the halfway point of the Eventide preview season and I have to say it's about time we previewed an Ouphe. The bar has been set pretty high after Shadowmoor brought us a pair of nice utility Ouphes, the card-drawing Dusk Urchins and the life-gaining and pun-loving Kitchen Finks. Joining Spellwild Ouphe as Ouphes who don't particularly care about the activated abilities of artifacts (ignoring for now the Brownie defectors), these new tribe members showed that just because your creature type sounds incredibly silly doesn't mean you can lay the beats and provide hours of entertainment for the whole family. (I guess Tarmogoyf already proved that.)\n\nBlue and green is probably my favourite colour combination. Of all time. Sure, ebony and ivory hold some appeal, as do silver and gold. Blue, green, orange has its moments, but, ultimately, I think the orange is unnecessary. With blue and green alone, you've got a mitt full of cards, a boatload of mana, a bushel basket full of beef, and a whole can of whoop-ass.\n\nBesides their unique strengths, as you can see from this diagram, the areas where blue and green overlap are totally awesome! At least for the Johnny.\n\nJust think: If you start with a single, solitary counter, and you take that counter and double it each turn, by the end of the month you'll have more than a million dollars!\n\nI'm particularly excited about the idea of using Gilder Bairn, Presence of Gond, and Door of Destinies together (with other Elves, naturally). Tap the Bairn to make an Elf, untap it to double the number of charge counters on Door of Destinies, lather, rinse, and repeat. Pretty soon you'll have an army of enormous Elves (and very shiny hair).\n\nCharge counters are another \"standard\" counter, at least since Mirrodin. There is ample reason to double these counters as well. You might want to produce lots of mana (Altar of Shadows, Black Market, all the Mana Batteries), gain tons of life (Clearwater Goblet), kill creatures (Infused Arrows, Heliophial), make a whole bunch of Snakes (Orochi Hatchery), make a whole bunch of very big Snakes (Riptide Replicator), or just do whatever it is that Ventifact Bottle does.\n\nBefore Y2K, there was Armageddon Clock. One of them has pretty much no effect at all and the other is a computer glitch. Counting down to Armageddon is fun and all, but the fact that any player can turn back the clock is a little disappointing. Add Eon Hub to skip the upkeep, and your mutual destruction is practically assured. Heck, you could use Gilder Bairn's Ouphe-y brethren (Brown Ouphe) to counter any attempts to remove the doom counters. Armageddon Clock also happens to be the only magical clock that actually works with Clockspinning (except for Mistform Ultimus, of course).\n\nIf ever there was a card that was made for Gilder Bairn, it's Coral Reef. Not only is it a permanent that comes into play with counters and can redistribute those counters to other creatures, but it also provides a handy tap outlet for your Gilder Bairns. What can you possibly use polyp counters for, you ask? Well, for starters, you simply buff up the backsides of your creatures. Like I always say, a 1/4 Gilder Bairn is better than a 1/3 Gilder Bairn. Those +0/+1 counters can turn certain creatures into face-smashing monsters if you can somehow switch their power and toughness (Thanks, layer 6e!). Your polyp-enhanced Aquamoebas and Turtleshell Changelings will become serious threats if they can get through unblocked.\n\nI used to like to play decks that pretty much do nothing. For a while, I had an oversized blue-white deck that did little more than stall the game with an arsenal of counterspells and recurring Hesitations and Standstills (Thanks, Hanna!). Meanwhile, I would be playing cards like Portent and Ransack to ensure that my opponent drew nothing relevant (i.e. nothing but lands). It wasn't a particularly good deck, mind you, but it was fun to see exactly how long I could get away with doing nothing. Story of my life.\n\nBack Under The Sea:\n\nBesides having one of the coolest made-up words ever for a name, Scuttlemutt can pull up Scarecrosoft Paint and change the color of any creature you want.\n\nBesides all of the not blocking going on, there's a subtheme of discard lurking in there. Piracy Charm performs its triple threat role with charm (naturally), and Noggin Whack nails your opponent's hand with a brick (fish included).\n\nThough he was once merely a river guide, the Aurora must have transformed Sygg into a bloodthirsty, no-holds-barred cutthroat! I guess he wasn't paid enough. Yes, it seems ol' Syggy took one of those pirate self-help classes (Discover the Inner Seafaring Cutthroat Within You!) and transformed his life. The program was offered to Throat Slitter, who seemed a perfect fit, but he turned it down. I wonder why!\n\nEver since Lorwyn hit the shelves, Wanderwine Prophets have been the subject of jokes around the Magic community, cruel jokes like \"Why did the Merfolk cross the road?\" (So the Prophets have nothing to champion!)\n\nSilvergill Adept (who puts the Mer in Merchant of Secrets)\n\nI Said I Love You, But Allied:\n\nWhat can I do with allied colours? Well, now that I know the five of them like to go to make-out parties with Mark Rosewater, I have a few more options. But as fun as elaborating on this scenario would be, I think I'll build some decks instead. After all, what would a house of cards be without a deck or two or five? An apartment of cards, sure. Possibly a lean-to of cards. Let's not overthink this.\n\nWorldpurge: Combining blue's love of bouncing permanents, shuffling, and emptying mana pools with white's love of seven-mana sorceries\n\nYou can, for example, attack with a bunch of 1/1 Kithkin Soldiers, then, during your second main phase, play a Cloudgoat Ranger (or whatever) and respond to that by playing Worldpurge out from under your hideaway land!\n\nDown By The River:\n\nHey, gang, it's good to be back. The aches in my Johnny muscle have largely subsided and the pipes that drain into my bottomless well of puns have been unclogged. My instinct for tortured metaphor is keener than ever, and I'm ready to go.\n\nImpure Reflection:\n\nThe biggest problem with puns, as I see it, is that there is no victim. How can I possibly feel smugly superior to someone with this kind of tiresome word-play? Of course, some would say that the English language is the real victim. Others might suggest that we all suffer whenever a pun is uttered. I've even heard it said that God kills a kitten every time one word is recontextualized because it sounds like another word. Now, that might be going too far, even for me, but you have got to applaud God for his initiative.\n\nI modeled the decks after the ones in Chris's columns. That's why they're so inefficient and watered-down with singletons. It's like sending your army into battle with one guy who is really good at juggling. Because you just never know when that particular skill will come in handy. It's amusing, perhaps, but only if you aren't the juggler.\n\nStart the Guest-ivities!:\n\nWelcome back to yet another House of Cards on yet another Thursday, which is right in the middle of yet another week. I could go on with dozens of unnecessary yets, but then I'd have the Yeti family crime gang after me, something I'd like to avoid. Just the other day I caught Stalking Yeti in his famous pastime of, um, stalking. In any case, today's column will be filled with plenty of tasty selections for Johnnys around the Internet. Ahead lies synergy, strategy, and an infinit-\n\nEh? What's that? You were expecting someone else? Biggish, and likely to be found in a cold environment? Well, I've no idea who you're talking about. I just hope the Yetis didn't get to him.\n\nApparently, from the mindset of the Scuzzback gang, it's always \"raid o'clock.\" After waiting about three days for my watch to show this time, I became impatient and subsequently decided to smash it to smithereens. I similarly destroyed my digital and cuckoo clocks (I have a lot of timepieces) before my hourglass, of all things, gave me the time I was looking for. (I would point out the fact that I broke the hourglass and spelled out \"raid o'clock\" with the sand, but this joke has gone on far enough.)\n\nFootbottom Feast - the Lorwyn reincarnation of Bone Harvest, but with less bone and more, um, footbottom\n\nThe Making of a -1/-1 Counter Culture:\n\nDubbed the Bogardan Phoenix Sons by someone with too much time on his hands (um, me), creatures with the persist mechanic return to play when they hit the graveyard\n\nDubbed the Super Quagmire Lampreys by someone willing to use any excuse to bring up Quagmire Lamprey (um, me), the creatures with wither are great sources of negativity (perhaps because of their withering sarcasm).\n\nYou can even Torture your own Poppet for profit!\n\nGiant Oyster as master healer? Only in Magic.\n\nSomething Quite Palette-able:\n\nSince Shadowmoor is a set where \"colour matters\" (I think I heard that somewhere), it only makes sense that a card like Painter's Servant would make an appearance therein. As Mark Rosewater stated in a recent article, \"Whenever we have a \"______ matters\" theme, I'm compelled to make the card that lets you turn everything into a ______.\" I could not be more supportive of this tactic. The recurring \"underscore matters\" theme is perhaps my favourite of all the \"punctuation matters\" themes. It edges out the \"parentheses matters\" theme (devoted, presumably, to exploring reminder text design), or the \"colon matters\" theme (exploring, um, certain activated abilities).\n\nCooking With Gas / Electricity:\n\nIn the end, ever the waffler, I flipped an endlessly sided coin to make my decision for me.\n\nWhat, you've never wanted to play Quirion Dryad in a mono-green deck before? I know I haven't until now.\n\nThe Big Sleeper:\n\nShadowmoor has been completely spoiled, but, don't worry, that doesn't mean it isn't fresh.\n\nCreatures that provide some repeatable way to damage Deep-Slumber Titan are one step up in my book, entitled Chris Millar's Compendium of Arbitrary Distinctions.\n\nIf damaging your own, non-Fungusaur, creatures with these cards seems silly, you have other options. As I like to say, this is Magic. You don't have to do anything I say. I am not your mother. You can even ignore the suggestions printed right on the card.\n\nBridging the Gap:\n\nBad rares are like poker hands. You've got to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. Perhaps you could fold 'em into a Menger sponge, but I'm not sure if that is what Kenny Rogers was trying to get at. On top of knowing all this, you've also got to know when to walk away and know when to run. That's a lot to keep track of, but if you can keep all four of those wise nuggets in your head, you will certainly experience less frustration when you're trying to break a particularly stubborn reject rare. Sometimes, if you can break on through the Wall of Resistance, you will come out the other side face-to-face with either the Wall of Hope or the Wall of Wonder, depending. That's how I felt after spending a head-poundingly long time trying to figure out if Twinning Glass was just an awkward version of Mirari combined with a not-quite Retraced Image-on-a-stick, or if it was something far, far worse. The answer, you might be surprised to learn, was 42. Ah, but what was the question?\n\nTo be honest, I thought the Mysterious Case of the Twinning Glass was closed.\n\nBut then something strange happened. I felt a curious stirring in my utility belt (that's where I keep my Lorwyn Player's Guide)\n\nIt seemed so good and so obvious that I quietly thought to myself, \"Oh, my God! Why didn't I think of this before?\" before leaping out of the bathtub and running through my living room shouting, \"Hypergenesis!\"\n\nFor those who don't get it: Hypergenesis is the Time Spiral update to Eureka...\n\nTwinning Glass also has some fringe uses. If you're playing a mirror match (How apt!), but you have Twinning Glass \"technology,\" you can piggyback your opponent's spells. I was almost tempted to build a 500-card deck (with Planar Portals) to see if this was even remotely viable, but I was simply too exhausted from leaping out of the bathtub earlier.\n\nNope, I'm going to call the creature without a name something a little more exotic than Akroma, Angel of Wrath. Despite already being used as a pseudonym by a friend of mine, I'm going to call our nameless friend \"Searing Wind.\"\n\nThrough a Glass Awesomely:\n\nThat's the thing about spring. It's full of possibities. The days are longer, the weather is warmer, the Leafs are golfier. Animals feel friskier, human beings feel livelier (and probably friskier), magicthegathering.com gets preview-ier, and my segues become hackier.\n\nThat's right, just play something like Birds of Paradise into Yavimaya Dryad into Spectral Force, and by turn four you could be attacking with 24-power worth of simulated man-broccoli!\n\nSomething Old, New, Borrowed, and Colourless:\n\nI usually like to have some unifying theme to my articles, even when it's not required, so consider these decks Ideas I Stole From Mark Gottlieb's magicthegathering.combos - Morningtide Edition. \"Stole\" is probably too harsh a term. \"Pirated\" or \"ninja'd\" would no doubt conjure images of Mistform Ultimus, something I'm usually up for avoiding. I'd use \"purloined\" but that sounds too, uh, suggestive. The thesaurus turns up \"defalcate,\" my new favourite word of all-time, but that one probably doesn't apply in this context. How about I say \"extrapolated\" instead?\n\nObviously, if you have Ashes of the Fallen in play naming Goblins, Wort (or Boggart Birth Rite) will allow you to return any creature you want. It didn't take me long to realize that this is long way to go for what is essentially the same effect as Oversold Cemetery, but since when does a Johnny do anything the easy way? I'm writing this article while wearing mittens, for example.\n\nI'm not normally a huge fan of land destruction decks (though they have their place, to be sure), but this one is so dumb and unnecessarily complicated that I simply can't not enjoy it.\n\nThere's No Shaman Trying:\n\nThis is unlike my old process, whereby I sat around and played a one-man word association game, repeating the word (in this case \"shaman\") out loud until some hitherto hidden connection revealed itself. I abandoned the technique since there was potential for embarrassment when you chanted made-up words like \"Meadowboon\" with different intonations or inflections... alone... in the public library.\n\nAh, the infinite. Is there any number you don't encompass? In the vernacular of the Magic player, infinity is an \"arbitrarily large\" number. To give you an idea of how this term is used, I might say, for example, \"My student debt is arbitrarily large\" or \"I feel ill after eating an arbitrarily large amount of Laffy Taffy.\" I might also say, \"I'm going to use Weirding Shaman to create an arbitrarily large number of Goblin Rogue tokens.\" In fact, I will say that.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of ways to go about doing this. You could tweak the combo that Mark Gottlieb wrote about in last week's feature article. He combined Weirding Shaman with Doubling Season and both Phyrexian and Ashnod's Altar to make infinite mana. With a second Doubling Season, you could make infinite Goblin Rogues. At five cards, however, the combo seems more than a little convoluted. That's why I'm going to make my arbitrarily large number of Goblin Rogues with, um, six cards. Okay, things didn't work out quite as planned (I'm going to fire my efficiency expert), but you can still make a lot of tokens.\n\nA pair of Dross Harvesters provide some measure of redundancy, as you will gain 2 life at the front end of the combo (when you sacrifice a creature). Similarly, a pair of Heartstones (reducing the cost of Weirding Shaman's ability to ) will eliminate the need for a second Carnival of Souls and the second Soul Warden, Angelic Chorus, or Dross Harvester. While they won't allow you to make infinite tokens with Weirding Shaman on their own, a trio of Heartstones will let you turn one black mana into one black Goblin Rogue, which, as you might expect, can get out of hand pretty quickly. I had devised a handy spreadsheet outlining all of the possible combinations and permutations, but my dog ate it or I'm lying.\n\nBranches? Branches? We Don't Need No Reach of Branches!\n\nEr, wait. Yes, we do. It's Shaman Week, after all, and Reach of Branches is the first name in Shaman token making.\n\nThere are a couple other Intuition targets in the deck: Wonder (because some of us like flying trees) and a flashback-able Parallel Evolution (because the people who like flying trees really, really like them).\n\nThis is only a small sampling of cards you can profitably pair with the latest Reach. Feel free to, uh, branch out into other territory. Or punch me.\n\nSpeaking of arcane means, I'd like to travel back to the land of Kamigawa, where mana costs ran wild and free and fish hovered in mid-air a lot more than usual.\n\nAny non-Elemental card reduces [Sunflare Shaman's] potency, but limiting yourself to Elementals might reduce your deck's potency. \"If only there was a way to turn all of the creatures in your graveyard into Elementals,\" I transitioned awkwardly. Actually, there is: Ashes of the Fallen, which also happens to combo with Horde of Notions to allow you to play any creature spell from your graveyard for a measly .\n\n\"Now, if only there was a way to put a whole bunch of creatures into your graveyard at once,\" I mused dreamily. Well, there is one of those, too: Iname, Death Aspect! Play Iname, fill your graveyard with Spirits (which will become Elementals as well, because of Ashes of the Fallen), and then fire off your Sunflare Shamans for some arbitrarily medium-sized amount of damage.\n\nThat's All, Evokes!:\n\nHowdy, all. Welcome to the Penultimate Pre-Preview Week Week! It promises to be a great time for those who prefer their preview cards to be a fortnight away, as well as for those who like the word \"penultimate.\"\n\nThe other five will provide grist for the Millar. I've always thought this column could use more grist and more references to myself in the third-person.\n\nI Never Meadowboon I Didn't Like\n\nIt's high risk, high reward, but that's what you should expect if you're getting your ideas from a snake.\n\nLook Up, Look Way Up:\n\nNow, I don't want to brag, or come across as a dude with a big head or something, but I often think of myself as a giant. That's because I'm a tall-ish person. In my youth, I had nicknames like Stretch and, uh, Millar, and my friends and family conspired to strap cinder blocks to my head to stop me from growing. They were thwarted at every turn by a little thing called the law, but I like to think that it was because they actually like me. In any case, I was spared the nickname Cindy until I was a full-grown adult.\n\nAccording to the Local Institute of Ego-boosting Statistics, tall men are supposed to make more money and have more success with the ladies than short men. If that's true, I wish I could set up a meeting between these statisticians, my boss, and some ladies.\n\nOne thing these number-crunchers always fail to mention is all that extra money and all of those extra special ladies don't mean much when you're laid up because of the frequent concussions suffered due to low-hanging light fixtures, store signage, air ducts, water pipes, and the general miserliness of the nation's entryways and exits.\n\nThere are still some Giants that are flying under the radar. It's a very high radar, presumably.\n\nThree plus six plus six plus six should be enough damage to kill all but the most robust of opponents, provided that my math is correct. I tried to verify this, but my abacus crashed while performing the calculation. Also, I don't know how to use an abacus. Great word, though.\n\nOf course, this is assuming that all of but one of your Skarrgan Skybreakers are still in your library, which is not guaranteed by any Stretch, least of all me.\n\nFavor of the Mighty? Flavor of the Week\n\nAs I sought out underused Giant cards to build around this week, I thought about Favor of the Mighty. It certainly has its uses. I've been using mine to make sure my trade binder is fully stocked.\n\nActs of Justifiable Countrycide\n\nOne Giant that is most assuredly on everybody's radar is one-time Swimming With Sharks previewee Countryside \"Wesley\" Crusher. This souped-up Trained Armodon has unleashed greater torrents of gamer drool than any souped-up Trained Armodon in the history of Magic, including Akroma, Angel of Fury and Akroma, Angel of Wrath (they're really souped-up Trained Armodons). Countryside Crusher combos with everything from Greater Gargadon to Lesser Gargadon to fifty-five Mountains and a random card of your choice.\n\nMastering Commander:\n\nOros provides two key things. One, he's an enormous flying beatstick (not to be confused with an enormous flying beetstick, one of the many weapons in the boggart arsenal)\n\nStates of Rogue:\n\nWelcome to Rogue Week! It's time to take a look at the crook, the thief, his lowlife, and their robbers.\n\nFirst, a fascinating piece of trivia: Did you know that the word \"rogue\" does not appear in the flavour text of a single Magic card? It also appears in the name of a lone Elephant card as well as every article title this week. Sadly, the word is also missing from each of the English-to-Pun dictionaries that I use to write my column, so all of you pun enthusiasts will have to go without. Pun haters rejoice.\n\nOne-mana 1/1s with comes-into-play abilities are pretty rare (though usually common).\n\nAs Doug Beyer mentioned yesterday, the Rogue creature type didn't even exist until Mirrodin, when Neurok Spy put them on the Magic map. Where on the Magic map? If I'm not mistaken, they're located in a little village on the outskirts of Beebleton. All I know is that until recently, Rogues had a thing against shiny baubles, and, to a lesser extent, beebles.\n\nNight of the Rarely Good:\n\nFebruary's got a little bit of everything: ice, snow, a smidgeon of forced romance, and, let's not forget, slush. It's like a nonstop party, especially if you're a polar bear in a long-term relationship.\n\nBut what about the unchased rares, the ones who spent last Thursday at home with a cup of chamomile and a tub of ice cream? Who's going to show them some love and shuffle them up? A little love is all they need and love don't cost a thing (well, maybe half a ticket).\n\nUnfortunately, despite all of my love for Baru (and despite his synergy with Everbark Shaman), I had to leave him out in favour of some other tricks. Feel free to add him back or build another deck entirely. It's February, the time of limitless possibilities.\n\nThe Making of a +1/+1 Counter Culture:\n\nAs Mark Rosewater mentioned on Monday, +1/+1 counters have been a part of the game since Alpha. You can trace their lineage from Fungusaur through to Fungal Behemoth and on to Fungus Sliver, while making numerous (and, happily, fungus-free) detours along the way.\n\nMark also noted that the +1/+1 counter can have many different flavours, from the representation of out-of-control fungal growth to the representation of controlled fungal growth and everything in between. At once highly adaptable and intrinsically flavourless, +1/+1 counters easily assume the flavour of their surrounding elements. They're kind of like tofu that way. Or chameleons. Or, I guess, chameleons made of tofu. Either way, fry some up for me!\n\nOur friend the +1/+1 counter is a very plain, very workmanlike counter. It doesn't have the cachet or sophistication of the loyalty counter, the indie cred of the polyp counter, or the unprecedented pitiability of the tide counter. It doesn't have the infectious charm of either the -0/-1 counter or the -2/-1 counter. It doesn't have the clockwork precision of the +1/+0 counter, the dash and pizzazz of the +2/+0 counter, or the solemn dignity of the +0/+2 counter. What it does have is its own theme week, so I'd better get cracking.\n\nLuckily, piling beads, pennies, or marbles on to creatures is such an entertaining enterprise that it didn't take much arm-twisting or editorial whip-cracking to get me to travel down this familiar path one more time. Plus, it's pretty much guaranteed that we're going to be playing with Elves and various green fatties, my two great loves (followed closely by chameleon tofu).\n\nWhen Lorwyn came out, the cycle of Elemental Incarnations (Dream, Death, Despair, Destruction...Oops, wrong cycle.)\n\nSeriously, how sick is Ashling the Pilgrim with Vigor? The cards have been out for months now, but I didn't think about putting them together until just now. If you can set Ashling off without killing Vigor, the Legendary Elemental will get all of its counters back! The next time you fire off its ability three times in a turn, you will deal twice as much damage as the first time.\n\nClass of the Titan:\n\nClass of the Titans\n\nWell, Warrior is a class of the Changeling Titans, at least.\n\nthere's Trained Armodon's vanilla 3/3 buddy, Nessian Courser (which sounds more like something that would break down in the Enterprise's engineering room than a Centaur Warrior)\n\nBoldwyr Heavyweights! Like many undercosted fatties before it, such as Eater of Days and Sky Swallower, Boldwyr Heavyweights fall pretty squarely in the Johnny camp. Not only do they boast uncommonly high stats for a four-mana creature, but they clearly have a peculiar, albeit nonabstract, diet. All this is not to say that Spike won't take the portly pair out for a night on the town... literally.\n\nShadow of Doubt kills the drawback entirely, but makes your Giant cost an awkward . At that point, you'd almost be better off playing a different creature. On the other hand, it might be worth trying if you're playing multiplayer, as a backup plan in a deck where you could get greedy with Blatant Thievery or cause a lot of chaos with Confusion in the Ranks. (I think I have an idea for an EDH deck).\n\nUntil next time, make lovviors, not warriors.\n\nNow Morn Ever:\n\nWelcome to Limbo Week, the only week of the year where lowering the bar is a sign of success!\n\nThis is one of those weeks between official previews and the actual release of the set where the columnists play party games on a carnival cruise ship as we drift through the first circle of Hell. You'd think after having been through this several times before that I would be used to it, but I'm not. It's still pretty terrifying and, fortunately, not the least bit true.\n\n\"Dip into the old mailbag!\" It's been a while (forever), since I've done that, seeing as I don't even have a mailbag. It's old-fashioned and inefficient filing system, if you ask me. As a modern man, hep to all of the latest developments in written communication, all of my mail is safely stored on the Internet somewhere.\n\nOf course, it should not be a great surprise that Ms. of the Mornsong is garnering some serious attention from those deckbuilders who like to walk (nay, run!) on the wild side. Heck, I'd even say she (It's a she, right?) is garnering some attention from me, if I really knew what \"garnering\" meant. I think it has something to do with parsley.\n\nIt just so happens that both the desirable effect and the nasty drawback are two edges of the same sword. You know, a double-edged, symmetrical one. What the right hand giveth, the left hand also giveth, but to someone who is trying to kill you with Magic.\n\nOf course, despite the fact that Maralen has the same effect on each player, you do have a 2/3 as well, making her not entirely symmetrical. It's more of triple-edged sword, I guess, with one edge that can be used to fend off grizzly bears.\n\nEven more devastating, however, is putting Maralen into play in response to cards like Brainstorm or Careful Consideration. In the case of the former, your opponent will not draw three cards, but will put two cards from their hand on top of their library. With the latter, your opponent will not draw four cards, but will discard two or three cards, depending. Ouch.\n\nThis will happen to you, too, if you play these cards while Maralen is on the board. Luckily, due to miracle of Constructed Magic, you don't have to put these kinds of cards in your deck.\n\nGas, 'Tings, Etc.:\n\nWelcome to Morningtide Preview Week, Part II: This Time It's Later in the Year.\n\na fancy and/or schmancy preview card\n\nUpon seeing this card, my first thought was, \"Wow, a green Sylvan Library.\" That statement is understandably a little confusing, since the Library has all of the trappings of a green card. Among said trappings are the fact that it's got a little piece of broccoli in the top right corner, it, for lack of a better word, is \"green,\" and it has \"Sylvan\" in the title, which, as you may know, comes from a French word meaning \"little piece of broccoli.\"\n\nEven with all of those points in its favour, however, Sylvan Library isn't really a green card. For one thing, what is a library doing in the forest? Are the Elves and the Beasts checking out copies of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Beaters or the latest Harry Potter? Despite those books being good reads, I highly doubt it. It makes no sense. Clearly, libraries should be on islands, where their contents can be perused by sentient fish and four-armed purple guys.\n\nHouse of Commons Blowout Spectacular!!!:\n\nYou see, in Toronto where I live, we had something like 35 centimetres of snow unceremoniously dumped on us. Worse, it seemed like every stop on my holiday tour of duty had been blanketed by more and more snow with less and less ceremony. The heavens just opened up and said, \"Deal with it.\" When I reached my final port of call, I was chagrined to discover that not only was I using terms like \"port of call\" and \"chagrined,\" but that the poor town had been swallowed up by more than 50 centimetres of the white, fluffy stuff. For those not familiar with the metric system, that's the equivalent of about three miles. It was deep. At a certain point, it would not have surprised me at all if the neighbours started loading various forest creatures onto a snowmobile, two by two.\n\nSure, you might counter my bottomless self-pity by pointing out that all of my snow has already melted, and, yeah, my roommate could commit justifiable homicide if I were to take credit for doing any shoveling whatsoever, but the fact remains that, like a certain Boggart dwelling, I am very anti-shovel. (Yes, it took two paragraphs to get to that joke. It's so worth it, though.)\n\nThe deck can come out of the gates extremely quickly. Even if you don't store your decks in some kind of gated enclosure, the deck still has game\n\nPithy Title:\n\nWelcome to Treefolk Week! With Snow Week and Hoser Week already in the books, I guess dedicating a whole week to trees is the only way we've got left to pander to the Canadians. And pander I shall!\n\nI'm going to start with a little combo I came up with two seconds ago: Tamanoa + The Rack. It's like The Rack has lifelink! The resulting deck will of course be named Tamarack, after the small, slender tree found primarily in northern half of North America. That's double north. A member of the larch family, the tamarack is easily recognizable (even from great distances) by its delicate deciduous foliage.\n\nIf you just enjoyed that fun tree fact, you're in luck: there's plenty more where that came from! It's called the Internet (or, I guess, the forest). Poke around in it for a while. You'll find all kinds of neat things. In the meantime, I'm going to play Magic cards.\n\nOf all the new Treefolk in Lorwyn, Doran, the Siege Tower is clearly (and somewhat ironically) the most powerful. The 2007 Magic World Champion, Uri Peleg, took home the big trophy playing a Standard deck containing four copies of the sick son of a beech.\n\nWorst of all, [Doran] makes the most peace-loving character in Magic into a killing machine. Poor Karn, Silver Golem. No more Mr. Passive Resistance, he's out to (reluctantly) kick some butt. With Doran at his side, Karn battles opposing critters as an 8/8. He'll still try to go easy on them, but that just makes things worse.\n\nDuring my search for cards to pair with Doran, I plugged \"+0/+X\" into a number of card databases. This led me to Living Armor. It also turned up this trio, all, remarkably, from Legends: Kry Shield, Subdue, and Great Defender. Boy, they don't make 'em like they used to. Thank God.\n\nYew Willow Pine? Yew Butternut!\n\nWow, that was a stretch even for me. It doesn't even make much sense when translated. Unfortunately, I spent a frighteningly larch amount of time on TreeCanada looking fir potential tree-related puns. I've already used alder best ones, but I maple some of the less poplar ones out of my bag of tricks and yews them later. Cedar sycamore hemlock.\n\nOl' Doran isn't the only all-walkin', all-talkin', all singin' tree whose board-way melody we should all be paying some heed. No, not Singing Tree.\n\nBesides making your piddly 5/7s into 6/8 behemoths, T.P. makes them indestructible to boot. An unrepentant tree-hugger (What did you expect?), he keeps your Forests safe from harm as well. As long as he's around, you don't have to worry about Orcish Settlers, Boggart Loggers, Goblin Gardeners, or Akki Florists.\n\nI Will Not Lignify That With a Response\n\nYour once combat-fearing \"Wall of Hats\" is now a 5/9 beatstick, ready to storm into battle (with appropriate headgear, presumably).\n\nYou can also use [Merfolk Thaumaturgist] to wipe creatures off the board in conjunction with either Lignify or Ovinize. With Eternal Witness and Vedalken Mastermind on the board, you can keep doing this, turn after turn. You're a dead yew. You're a dead ewe. Have fun with homophones!\n\nOften at this time of year, Magic columnists (Anthony Alongi is the only one I can think of right now, but I'm sure there are others) will build some holiday theme decks. The theme might be something as simple as adhering to a strict red-white (See: Claus, Santa) or red-green colour scheme.\n\nHeck, you can include all three colours! Nothing says holiday spirit like some Fiery Justice.\n\nCrew's Control:\n\nGallowbraid and Morinfen aren't just the names of a death metal band and an arthritis medication. They're also black fatties with painful upkeeps, famous for being in a deck called, I believe, Aesop and Son. I could be wrong on that one.\n\nOne of my favourite games ever involved recurring a [Veteran Explorer] repeatedly against an Affinity deck. I sure did have a lot of mana when I lost.\n\n\"Doesn't tap to attack\" means \"doesn't cause Maraxus to shrink.\" I believe that's somewhere in the reminder text.\n\nThe Rarely Good, the Bad and the Ugly:\n\nLorwyn has been out for several weeks now, which is plenty of time to decide whether or not some of our friends with gold expansion symbols deserve the self-esteem-crushing label \"reject rare.\" The cards I'm going to talk about aren't \"rejects\" as much as simply \"under the radar.\" But \"under-the-radar rare\" just doesn't crush the self-esteem in quite the same way. No one said I was \"under the radar\" in high school, for example.\n\n[Incendiary Command]'s like a Lava Axe, a Lava Storm, a Lava Blister, and a [insert name of future red card-drawer with the word Lava in the title]all in one! It provides some pyroclasmic redundancy, is rarely useless, and is perhaps the only red card in this paragraph that can destroy a Plains (think Savannah or Temple Garden), a plainswalker, and a planeswalker.\n\nNot only does Noxious Ghoul make for a great insult if you happen to live in Elizabethan England (in my mind, it's second only to Filthy Cur in this respect)\n\nWhen I wade through a massive collection of decklists (like the States / Champs results) I'm always on the lookout for oddball strategies, people playing my pet cards, or both at the same time. Basically, I hope to see some players / deckbuilders with great intestinal fortitude and/or loose screws.\n\nGranting haste to your guys is cool, but granting them \"skillhaste\" is probably cooler. That goes double if no one knows what you're talking about (That's always cool, right?)\n\nLast of all, I always like to include some fatties with my Elves (I guess it's my Christmas spirit).\n\nThe Changeling Of The Guard:\n\nThis article started out with a huge and somewhat deranged caustic rant aimed at Mistform Ultimus, which I'm not going to pick quotes from because the whole thing is borderline-quotable and also rather strange. Then he continued:\n\nBy the way, welcome to Pre-Changeling Week! Due to some unforeseen temporal anomalies (Hey, wasn't that last block?), I won't be around next Thursday for Changeling Week proper. Some turkey will be filling in for me. Until then, let's build some changeling decks and steal all of Rosewater's puns.\n\nHow would you like to attack with an army of enormous indestructible creatures with double strike and, uh, banding? That's just what you can do with Mirror Entity, Timber Protector, an equipped Raksha Golden Cub, and Soraya the Falconer.\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous changeling-enhancer is world-fameless samurai master, Iizuka the Ruthless. I'm not sure why he's so ruthless, but it probably has something to do with people spelling his name wrong all the time. Two consecutive i's? Really?\n\nThere has been some controversy lately about the fact that there are no Goats in Lorwyn. No true Goats. No pure-blooded, dyed-in-the-wool Goats. I've known about this since I read a thread in the Future Set Speculation forum entitled \"No Goats in Peanut Butter.\" True fact and words to live by.\n\nThe reason for the controversy is that Goatnapper has nothing to 'nap. He's all dressed up with no place to goatnap. Sure, he can kidnap changelings, but it's just not the same. With no Goats, you get some initial head-scratching, followed by a realization: \"Oh, right. Changelings.\" With one goat, you get some initial head-scratching (\"Is that it?\"), followed by the same realization. Plus, you've also got this poor Goat running around with a huge bullseye on it. That sounds like a win-win to me.\n\nOn top of all that, having a genuine Goat would make it easier on the dimwitted Goblins. Imagine this conversation in the Goblins' secret hideout:\n\nGoblin Bookie: So, did you kidnap the Goat?\n\nGoatnapper: Yes. [Opens burlap sack, pulls out Amoeboid Changeling]\n\nGoblin Bookie: [Stunned silence] Um...Oh, right. Changelings. You milk it.\n\nThere are a couple other one-sided Wrath combos involving Shields of Velis Vel. Goblin Pyromancer or Tivadar's Crusade will do the trick if your opponent is playing Goblins (and he or she most assuredly will be).\n\nMilitia's Advice:\n\nLorwyn's primary white tribe, the Kithkin, are perhaps the weeniest of all white weenies. Certainly weenier than Samurai. However, what they lack in stature, they more than make up for in smallness.\n\nwhat are the Kithkin anyway? Are they just dwarves with a no-facial-hair policy, like the New York Yankees? Are they really three apples tall, as some reports suggest?\n\nKith Me, I'm from Irish Mythology\n\nLuckily, one of the Johnnier Kithkin cards (Militia's Pride) happens to facilitate and enhance a beatdown strategy with the added bonus of maximizing shenanigan-potential. I'm not alone in this assessment. Alextfish's pro-Militia's Pride post in Bennie's forum read like a précis of the article I had planned for this week, so either we have the same Johnny instincts, we plugged identical phrases into Gatherer, or both. Like I always say, great minds search the same card databases.\n\nThat's me again!\n\nIf you're like me, you'll find that many of your best ideas come to you while you're slacking off at work.\n\nAh, Kithkin Greatheart. If you have struck first, it is by standing on the shoulder of a road that a Giant is walking on.\n\nNormally, including such cheap beaters in a deck with high-cost creatures like Giants would be less than ideal. Not these days, thanks to the modern-day Mistform Ultimii. Woodland Changeling, Avian Changeling, and Mirror Entity? They might be Giants.\n\nDo Kithkin Mercenaries Sell Themselves Short?\n\nClash Is In Session:\n\nToday, in a very special episode of a series I'm calling Behind the Mechanic, we're going to examine the Clash. This keyword-action supergroup rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the unexpectedly flammable bands War and Scry.\n\nThere are those who think that clash is too random. They've done studies on clash, you know. Apparently, 20% of the time, it works every time. Some of you might say that that doesn't make sense, or, worse, is completely inaccurate. I won't argue with you. How could I? For starters, I pulled that statistic right out of my Shimmering Grotto.\n\nOn top of that, even if the number was accurate, it would only apply to \"naked\" clashes, those clashes that follow the usual script: I'll show you mine, you show me yours, and if mine's bigger, you take a Lightning Bolt to the head or whatever.\n\nBut if you're gonna go to all the trouble of clashing with your opponent (you know, doing all that number-crunching), you might as well win the darn things for the love of Pete. That's what I always say, although I usually say it in much stronger, Pete-free language. Let's see what we can come up with.\n\n[Intet, the Dreamer]: ...This way, you can get a \"free\" card whenever you attack. You might say she's a flyer full of discounts.\n\nWhen it comes to clashing, the only thing that does it more than my wardrobe is an Elf deck.\n\nFor a Few Forces More\n\nOf all the tribes in Lorwyn, it makes sense that the snooty, know-it-all Elves would be the most clash-ist. Besides the alluring Nath's Elite and basilisk-esque Gilt-Leaf Ambush, there's Fistful of Force and Woodland Guidance as potential non-Elf clashers. Sure, the Goblins have access to Adder-Staff Boggart and Dripping Deader, I mean, Bog Hoodlumsas well as Lash Out and Weed Strangle as in-colour utility spells. And, yes, Treefolk have noogie-master Oaken Brawler and Sentry Oak and some nice in-colour clash-enhancers. Okay, so apparently Elves have no special relationship with clash and I'm just fixing the facts in order to build another Elf deck. If you're feeling litigious, you know what to do.\n\nYour opponents are going to be blocking the Elite whether they like it or not, so why don't we make them like it as little as possible? What can you use to make this kind of creature especially Nath-ty?\n\nHow about something like Venom, Gaze of the Gorgon, or the latest in a short line of unpleasant green tricks, Lace with Moonglove. What's a Moonglove? Is it what a Moonraker wears while he's Moongardening? I don't know, but it seems plausible. All I know is that it sounds like one of MaGo's trademarked doomsday devices, and its effect on your opponent's creatures is just as devastating.\n\nRebels Without an Intervening \"If\" Clause\n\nMarvelous Team-Ups:\n\nAmong the first Lorwyn cards revealed on this site, these plucky and highly coordinated little fighterser, I mean, these powerful beingscan hop from one plane of the multiverse to the next, either at will or willy-nilly, depending. If it struck their respective fancies, they could have breakfast in Ulgrotha, lunch in Mirrodin, and dinner in KamigawaI hear the Shell of the Last Kappa is delicious. They could spend their winters enjoying the sun, sand, and sacred mesas of southern Dominaria; their summers luxuriating in the ridiculously overcosted resorts of Mercadia; and their yearly two weeks of vacation in, I don't know, the streets of Ravnica. Basically, they can choose their own Extended. It's a pretty sweet gig if you can get it.\n\nYou can add and remove loyalty counters by activating one of the planeswalker's abilities. Using an ability with a plus-sign next to it lets you add a loyalty counter (go figure), while using an ability with a minus-sign makes you subtract a loyalty counter. Abilities with a forward slash require long division, but we won't be going into that today (or, probably, ever).\n\nMetamerfosis:\n\nUntil Time Spiral's temporal craziness changed everything, there had not been a new Merfolk card since Apocalypse (except, of course, for Mistform Ultimus). What's the deal with that? For that matter, what's the deal with airline food? While I'm at it, what's the deal with Deal or No Deal? Basically, there are a lot of deals that I'm questioning right now.\n\nLuckily for the Johnny, these corally fixated, reef-dwelling, bikini-topped sea-dudes provide us with a ton of deckbuilding opportunities. Let's trawl through my inbox for ideas. If we catch some shrimp in the process, I've got the garlic sauce.\n\nUtopia Vow turns your Merfolk into a Utopia Tree, so just tap the creature to add one blue to your mana pool, enjoy the fruits of your triggering, and then use the blue mana to untap the creature. Flip after ten minutes. Er, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nAncient magicians are no doubt screaming out for Fallen Empires's Vodalian War Machine, which was recently made available online through Masters Edition. It's like a circus that can attack and pump itself with the help of Merfolk. You don't need to explain to me why Vodalia is a fallen empire.\n\nI've waited for this day for many years. Finally, we have Wizard tokens! Sure, you could make them yourself with Volrath's Laboratory, Riptide Laboratory, Soul Foundry, or some Artificially Evolved token-maker. Ignoring for a moment my attempts to start a Wizard Conspiracy with Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder, this method of producing Wizards has always seemed like a lot of work to me, and I'm unfathomably lazy. You would need Captain Nemo to plumb the depths of my laziness.\n\nWhat I ended up with is a pretty straightforward Merfolk beatdown deck with some added explosiveness.\n\nCod's Wallop\n\nNameless Inversion, which my friends and I have been calling \"Innocent Virgin\" because we talk funny in Canada, is a Merfolk.\n\nTribal And Error:\n\nShapesharer (which I keep reading as Sheepshearer for some reason).\n\nAs Devin Low mentioned in his column last Friday, Goblins sure love to die. They're eager to give up their lives for a point of damage or two, or to have their faces vaulted, and, frankly, we're eager to have them do it. Having moved largely into black, modern day Goblins have a penchant for necromancy and won't stay dead for very long.\n\nPurveyor of futuristic cutlery SporkMaster5000 wrote in...\n\nSince the combo he outlined is jam-packed with Goblins, Donald suggested Boggart Shenanigans as the kill card. It acts as a sort of Disciple of the Facevault.\n\n(For the record, I love the name Warren Pilferers, although I can't decide whether it's more befitting of a Goblin, a shady accountant, or an NFL linebacker.)\n\nThe Elementals of Style\n\n1. Omit needless Birds.\n\n2. Add Elementals.\n\nIt's a pretty straightforward process, really. Once you figure out how to get those pesky Birds out of there, the difficulty lies in choosing the right mix of Elementals. Luckily, I was spared this task by a pair of industrious Elementalists who happen to read this column. The Elemental apple of their Johnny eyes was Ceaseless Searblades, a creature that should probably go into business with Shapesharer selling sea shells by the sea shore.\n\nP/review:\n\nAs you can imagine, I was as happy as a Clambassador when I found out that Lorwyn would be packed with more Elves than the Keebler family reunion.\n\nYou start with a card Mark Rosewater previewed a couple weeks ago, Nath of the Gilt-Leaf. You might say that he's a marriage between Durkwood Boars, a one-sided Bottomless Pit, a Hivestone hacked to \"Warriors\" with Artificial Evolution, and a Riptide Replicator with one counter on it, set to \"green\" and \"Elf,\" and with the ability to be activated for free whenever your opponent discards a card. You might also say that he does his own thing.\n\nTwo Tuesdays ago, he had this to say about Hamletback Goliath:\n\n\"The Ferrett's preview card. Holy crap, my brain exploded. With combos!\"\n\nLuckily, David survived this impromptu combotomy.\n\nBoth the Forcemage and Hampsterdance Goliath\n\nWell, it was tough to decide which of the remaining preview cards I should build around. On the one hand, you've got the über-wacky Gilt-Leaf Palace. On the other, you've got stick-in-the-mud Gaddock Teeg. On still a third hand, you've got an array of Mer-, Tree-, Goblin-, Elf-, and Faeriefolk, as well as Cryptic Command. It's a bigger hand than I was expecting.\n\nTo make matters worse, Lorwyn brought with it another master of the red zone, Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile, who I have taken to calling Brigid, the Really Heavy Ballista for obvious reasons.\n\nI know that a certain segment of the Magic-playing population groans whenever they see Loxodon Warhammer in a deck list. It's a Timmy's dream, and, well, I'm half Timmy. I get it from my mom's side of the family.\n\nEven if you're not a power gamer, doesn't the idea of equipping the 'hammer to Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile make you smile just a little bit? What if you imagine this great archer with a quiver full of hammers? No? All right.\n\nWhistle an Angry Tune:\n\nSoulbright Flamekin is definitely a nifty little tool that can fit into a variety of decks. To use the buzzwords of the day, this card is more modular than linear (if you look at it on that particular continuum), and its hyperbolic rating is like nothing I've ever seen (or ever will see again).\n\n1. It can give a creature trample.\n\n2. It can turn six mana of any colour into eight red mana.\n\n3. It's an Elemental\n\n4. It's a Shaman.\n\n5. I have probably been referring to it with the wrong gendered pronoun this whole time.\n\nTenth Edition's Bogardan Firefiend recently betrayed its Elemental roots and has some nice synergy with Greater Gargadon. In fact, it makes me wish there was a Bogardan Gargadon, if only to watch people try to pronounce it.\n\nThe Bidder and the Sweet:\n\nWell, with both Xenic Poltergeist and Karn, Silver Golem able to turn your artifacts into creatures, you can animate your Bombs and send them into the red zone with cries of, \"OMG! He's a walking Time Bomb!\"\n\nWhat's a Terravore?\n\nFor smashing with.\n\nUnless you're a staunch Cyclops supporter, one of something might be good, but two is better.\n\nOne Ring that Totally Rules:\n\nGday, Johnnies and preview-seeking interlopers. Its Day Three of Week One of Set Sixty-Something Previews. Thats Lorwyn, by the way. I figured it out from the banner.\n\nOn Monday, Rei Nakazawa started things off by showing you Gaddock Teeg, the most powerful Tribal Unity hoser ever printed, while Mark Rosewater gave you Timber Protector, a Treefolk lord whose flavour textLifes a birch.heralds a new golden age of italicized puns. Okay, thats not its real flavour text, but a guy can dream, cant he? Then on Tuesday, The Ferrett previewed the least merciful black fatty since Kaervek the Merciless. Theres not a shred of mercy between the two of them.\n\nNot only can it do a million different things, but many of those things are outright ridiculous. While I was brainstorming deck ideas, I lost track of the number of times I said, Wait... Can you...? Oh, my God. I dont know why I was keeping track of this particular statistic in the first place, but trust me when I say that you will probably experience a few of those moments yourselves as you discover some new card to pair with it.\n\nAs my editor and personal rules guru Kelly Digges told me, Basically, Rings of Brighthearth lets you do everything after the colon twice while doing everything before the colon only once.\n\nLet me tell you, there are some pretty nasty things to the left of the colon, things you dont want to have to go through twice if you dont have to. The activated abilities of a permanent are much more likely than a spell to have steep additional costs, whether its discarding a card, sacrificing a creature, paying life, revealing cards in your hand, or removing cards from the top of your library. Tap five untapped Donkeys you control. Pay five-seventeenths of your life, rounded sideways.\n\nThe Myojin has one of the most powerful activated abilities ever seen on a creature, but once the divinity counter has been used up youre stuck with a ten-mana Hill Giant. Well, with Rings of Brighthearth and Homarid Spawning Bed, you can turn that 3/3 into twenty 1/1s for five measly mana.\n\nThe basic idea here is to use all of blacks trademark land-fetching (Korlash, Heir to Blackblade, Corpse Harvester, and Twisted Abomination, with an assist from Lord of the Undead)\n\n'Barbs Extant:\n\nThey say that bad news comes in threes. Just ask Goldilocks. So with the recent departures of Taste the Magic's Matt Cavotta and Latest Developments' Aaron Forsythe, you just new that the proverbial third shoe would have to drop. I would like to announce right now that not only does my country boast some unusual proverbs, but I'm also leaving. Yes, it's true. If I don't get out the door right away, I'm going to be late for Evil Dead: The Musical. Don't worry, though. I'll be back in less than a paragraph.\n\nOne bad thing about Manabarbs is that while it's great at sealing the deal and preventing miraculous comebacks, it's not particularly good if you've fallen behind in the game and you are trying to get back in it. Unless...\n\nHuh? Oh, yeah, I kinda trailed off there.\n\nAs I've explained in incredible detail above, Manabarbs makes paying for your spells painful. Of course, that is only true if you're using mana drawn from lands to do so. If you're playing your spells for free by pitching cards or sacrificing lands, you will be remarkably pain-free. Red is full of such analgesic spells.\n\nIf mono-red isn't your cup of tea, or your bag for that matter\n\nSince I want to branch out a bit from the white and red decks, I decided to look elsewhere for inspiration. Luckily, I didn't have to look far. Dang astigmatism.\n\nMidnight in the Rarely Good Garden of Evil:\n\nWelcome to another edition of House of Cards! Before I begin this week's deck-stivities with arguably the worst coinage ever (oops, too late.),\n\nI'd like to spend a little time discussing something near and dear to all of our hearts. No, not our bicuspid valves. I'm talking about baseball.\n\nThis usually means I'll steer clear of that card for a little while so things don't get too repetitive. The point is, I've steered clear long enough. It's time to, uh, crash straight through the guard rail of creativity and go plummeting down the cliffs of inspiration.\n\nHe took the following deck to a PTQ in Bristol, home of the Chicken of Bristol. It (the deck, not the chicken) uses Demonic Collusion\n\nAwesome stuff! I think all games get better when your opponents have confused looks. Except solitaire. Then it's just embarrassing.\n\nTribal Play:\n\nWelcome to Don Slaught Week here at magicthegathering.com!\n\nI'm not sure why I specified magicthegathering.com. I guess you never can tell if some other web site will simultaneously devote a week's worth of content to a long-retired journeyman catcher and I don't want there to be any confusion about what site you're currently browsing. If you weren't sure, it's this one.\n\nI agree that it seems odd to dedicate an entire theme week to a fairly obscure Major League baseball player. I can only assume that we did it because several members of R&D have ties to Pittsburgh, the city where Don Slaught spent much of his career. If this marks the beginning of a trend, I look forward to theme weeks covering other forgotten athletes, such as judo master Amir \"The Thinker\" Rodin, sharpshooting biathlete Cody S. Sey, and the 1968 Olympic pole-vaulting champion, Abe Trayersofkamigawa. Are these theme weeks on the horizon? Only time will tell. Also, no.\n\nNow the question becomes, \"How does one go about building decks based on a baseball player?\" Well, it might seem like a stretch, but I'm going to suggest that teams are like tribes. Heck, the Major League team from Cleveland is nicknamed \"The Tribe.\" Extrapolating further, a team like the Toronto Blue Jays could be represented by a Bird theme deck, the Baltimore Orioles by a, uh, Bird deck, and the St. Louis Cardinals could, um, also be represented by Birds. Okay, I hope Don Slaught played for a more diverse group of teams, like the Soldiers, Beasts, and Rebel Clerics. I'm a wee bit sad, because I know going into this little experiment that there's no Major League Baseball team called the Elves. Maybe there should be one, though. At the North Pole.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, the man of the hour, Don Slaught, spent much of his career in Pittsburgh playing for the Pirates. That's somewhat unfortunate, because Pirate decks pretty much build themselves. Either they're clones of Mercadian Masques era land destruction decks, or straightforward blue aggro. Rather than tread on well-trodden territory, I built a deck around some creatures whose names only a pirate can say best: Gnarrs!\n\nLater on, it occurred to me that you can pump up all three Gnarrs simply by playing a Cavern Harpy. The only problem would be the mana, but you could solve that by using Aluren. If you want some arbitrarily large Gnarrs (and who wouldn't?), I'd start there.\n\nDon Slaught rounded out his Major League career with brief stints with California Angels, the Chicago White Sox, and the San Diego Padres. In terms of tribal decks, two of those teams can be easily translated. The Padres are Clerics and the Angels are, um, Angels. I'll get to the White Sox in a minute.\n\n[...] Oh, yeah, the White Sox. Check out the feet of Children of Korlis. They look white to me. All I know is I wouldn't want to be the Laundress of Korlis.\n\nWell, that about does it for this week. A man's sixteen-year career summed up in three decks. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I do know that this was a weird theme week. I wonder if it means something. I guess only time will tell. Also, no.\n\nDog Days:\n\nSo I'm writing this on my birthday, because, well, I love you Johnnies so much and/or my deadline is tomorrow. I'm 28 now. This seems like a fine age to be, especially since I'm not the lead singer of a groundbreaking rock and roll band. I've been told that reaching this milestone has put me in some good company. For instance, Orson Welles, director of Citizen Kane, also had a birthday when he was 28.\n\nTenth Edition's Upwelling, a sort of mana-bank which allows you to save your spare mana at an interest rate comparable to an actual bank.\n\nAs Mark says, \"[The combo] would remove the greatest risk of using Braid of Fire, mana burn, and I've been wracking my brains on how to exploit itat least, on how to stay alive long enough to exploit it! Any thoughts?\"\n\nWhy, yes, I do have some thoughts. It's one of the privileges of being a sentient lifeform. While many of these thoughts are irrelevant as well as inappropriate for a family site, others are not. I will discuss these now.\n\nTwo columns ago, I arranged marriages for many Tenth Edition creatures. Unbeknownst to me, Puppeteer and Kamahl, Pit Fighter had eloped six years ago and didn't tell anybody, so I looked a bit foolish trying to wed them again. Everyone else still seems happy together, though.\n\nNow, I don't profess to know how Balduvian Warlord actually works. The FAQ for the poor, complicated bastard makes a Stephen King novel look like a James M. Cain. And it doesn't even include the regularly, occasionally, and rarely asked questions like \"Can I use this as a beer coaster?\" and \"Where do you keep the aspirin?\" All I know is that under certain circumstances you can use him to make someone block your lovely Knight of Dusk. Sure, it's a long way to go to kill a creature, but it's always more entertaining to jump through hoops. Just ask a circus performer.\n\nSiege-Gang Commander combos with Flowstone Salamander in many of my favourite Magic limericks.\n\nOld Least Favourites:\n\nDark Ritual, Hypnotic Specter, Hymn to Tourach If there is an unholy trio in Magic, this is it. No offense to Linda, Dolly, and Emmylou, but they have nothing whatsoever to do with Magic: The Gathering. These three cards have been wreaking havoc and crushing dreams for over a decade. They're like the New York Yankees, except powered by black magic. Oh, wait... never mind.\n\nEventually, my patience, like my boxer shorts, wore thin. My lightly-sautéing disgruntlement boiled over into a mixed metaphor of piping-hot frustration.\n\nBut, hey, after three years or so, I got over it. I learned to stop worrying and love plagiarizing Stanley Kubrick.\n\nI put the deck together online for about a dollar and I definitely got my money's worth. Er, wait, that makes it sound bad. It was worth every penny? Money well spent? Pick something that doesn't sound sarcastic.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only spellslinger who gets his curmudge-on because of a friend's unlikely-yet-annoying pet card.\n\nLittle did I know, I had opened Pandora's Box. Worse, that box was full of squirrels.\n\nOf course, even the blind non-squirrel player will find a nut, and I eventually evened up my record against the Shrine deck. For purposes of my sanity, I'm gonna say that an approximately 1-30 record makes us even. There is no further need for me to prove that I can beat that deck. I did it once and that should be enough to satisfy all but the pettiest Gregs.\n\nAll of this rather expensive tomfoolery was cheapened by the Nightscape Familiars. They just had no sense of decorum.\n\nAs much as I love a toolbox, those Merchant Scrolls should probably be something like Sage Owl or, if you prefer, Spire Owl.\n\nI'm also a fan of Wormfang Drake, Flametongue Kavu, and Goretusk Firebeast, so I'm surprised that it took me until this exact moment to realize that their names are put together the same way. The formula would seem to be:\n\nNoun used as a quasi-adjective + part of the mouth + creature type. Here it is in action:\n\nIronjaw Orcs\n\nBloodgums Merfolk\n\nRocktonsil Ogre\n\nLavauvula Elemental\n\nWow! They sound like totally (not) real Magic creatures, although, admittedly, that last one is a bit of a mouthful.\n\nKaervek the Hairless:\n\nIs that love in the air? I hope so. I can't really tell because of these paint fumes. Either way, I'm feeling a little light-headed. As many of you are well aware, it's summer time so Wedding Season is fully underway in my neck of the woods. It coincides with Kitchen Cabinet Painting Season, apparently.\n\nLike Vedalken Mastermind, Stampeding Wildebeests is best friends with creatures like Kavu Climber that do things when they come into play. In fact, they love each other so much that some are questioning why they don't just get married. One of that \"some\" is me, so I should probably put them in the same decklist, which is a sign of true commitment.\n\nX Appeal:\n\nHowdy, folks, and welcome to X Week! As my fellow columnists have no doubt discussed, the letter X has a number of important uses. It's great for describing groups of mutant superheroes, for example. Everyone's heard of the X-Men. The B-Men? Not so much. The letter X also comes in handy when you are short on time and you need to summarize your movie collection. If you need to mark a spot for some reason, you wouldn't consider using any other letter. X also happens to be the Roman numeral for ten. Coincidentally, the Tenth Edition of Magic's Core Set was recently released, so this is the wacky angle I'm going to pursue for my column this week.\n\nThat's not all Scout's Warning can do, however. Another cute trick you can pull is to flash out a True Believer in response to a direct-damage spell aimed at your noggin. \"Sorry, fella. Me have shroud,\" you might say.\n\nMight May be Right, but Power is, uh, Dour\n\nStupid rhyming dictionary.\n\nthe reanima-tastic Doomed Necromancer (which some pundits prone to exaggerate are calling \"reanima-tacular\")\n\nReductio Ad Absurdum:\n\nFor those of you wondering about the title of today's article and how it applies to building weird decks, I can only try to assure you that it does. If you think I'm just trotting out a Latin phrase from Philosophy 101 in order to make myself sound smarter than I am, well, you are totally wrong. With that kind of logic, you should probably go jump off a cliff with all your friends.\n\nDid I do that right?\n\nBrown Ouphe, which was recently joined by Ravaging Riftwurm on my list of Magic creatures that sound like mosquito-borne intestinal diseases\n\nAfter a horrible period of tournament Magic history, dubbed \"Ouphe Autumn\" by, uh, that guy over there, the player base got sick of the ubiquity of Ouphes\n\nI try not to be a mean person, so I will refrain from even attempting a Spell Burst \"lock.\" That's just too cruel. Instead, I'm going to use Clockspinning in conjunction with Reality Strobe and Riftwing Cloudskate to bounce all of my opponent's permanents before making a million Saproling tokens with Sprout Swarm. That seems much fairer.\n\nI used Compulsive Research and Careful Consideration because they both help you find Locket of Yesterdays and put spells in your graveyard. Fill up your graveyard with savings, as I always say.\n\nIf Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir is getting you down, you can always swap Search for Tomorrow for Into the North, trade the basic lands for snow-covered basics, and add some copies of Mouth of Ronom. You could also punch a wall.\n\nEnchantertainment:\n\nLike balloons and my '80s-era television from Sears, enchantments are famous for their static abilities.\n\nBy now, it's no secret that I like to put pants on my weenies.\n\nThe only catch is that you can only put [Daybreak Coronet] on a creature that already has an aura attached to it. That's just asking to be three-for-oned. The inherent riskiness of the card should come as no surprise, since the word \"coronet\" comes from the French and means \"all your eggs in one basket.\" Can someone fact-check that? Try the Oxford Encyclopedia of Made-up Junk. I'm sure it's in there.\n\nAuratouched Mage can easily undergo a Snake Cult Initiation, but Zur will have to join some other strange club with weird admission guidelines. I hear Wombats have interesting cults as well.\n\nA neat thing about Grave Peril is that it destroys creatures without ever targeting them. This, believe it or not, means that you can use it to kill creatures with protection from black, like the centaurs produced by Hunted Horror. Yes, my centaur friends, you can face a little peril.\n\nI think it's pretty much a rule that you have to hate your boss. This is true no matter no what your job is. Now, imagine that you flogged steam for a living. Once you wrapped your head around the fact that you ended up in such a bizarre career, wouldn't it be hard not to just loathe your boss, some guy sitting in the little metal pod-thingie who was, like, flogging you all the time? It seems to me that a little ill will would be justified in this case.\n\nThe Rigger They Are\n\nRigger Mortis\n\nfor the section and deck in which he breaks Steamflogger Boss. No, really.\n\nTribal By Fire:\n\n'm particularly fond of the excellently-named Imperiosaur. You can just imagine him raising his snout in the air, tut-tutting all those who stoop to using those uncivilized dual lands. How banal! \"I say, old boy, these days I kindly request that I be summoned by nothing but John Avon Forests.\"\n\nAnd who could forget Starke of Rath, the lovechild of Joven, Chandler, and, uh, Visara the Dreadful? Certainly not the Gatherer card database.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, if your Wild Dog or Drooling Ogre hurls a Shuriken at an opposing creature, you won't see it again unless they throw it back at you. Not the case with a Brooding Saurian on the board. I guess the intense brooding creates a magnetic attraction of some kind. That would also explain why I was covered with iron filings throughout high school.\n\nLovisa Coldeyes, lord and master of all she surveys (provided she surveys berserkers, warriors, and barbarians).\n\nThe Butcher, The Baker, and Hell's Caretaker\n\nThe Birds and the Trees:\n\nLike I always say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I sound like a rusty mouse over here. It's a robotic mouse, presumably.\n\nOf all the cards in Magic that allow you to really turn the tables on your opponent (with Turn the Tables not being one of them, to no one's surprise)\n\nIf, on the other hand, I'm attacking with a Loxodon Warhammer-wielding elf, you can safely bet that Orim's Thunder will clap, probably sarcastically, as I add two more cards to the bin.\n\nIt's a Bird! It's a Plane! No, I Was Right the First Time. It's a Bird.\n\n\"And in Invasion design, I made that cool bird lord. And then, in development, came the hate. I don't know what the team had against this card (which is odd as I was part of the team) but it was torpedoed like few cards have ever been torpedoed.\"\n\nPoor Kangee! You really have to be unpopular when you're a measly bird and you're the target of torpedoes. Seems like overkill to me. And he's not even an aquatic bird! That makes it even worse. It's like shooting moon-lasers into the ocean because you don't like shrimp.\n\nWhat is important is that the deck contains arguably one of the Johnniest cards with kicker ever made: Bog Down.\n\nHey, I said it was arguable, not that it could be successfully argued.\n\nJust imagine this scenario:\n\nTurn one: Dryad Arbor.\n\nTurn two: Vault of Whispers, Tarmogoyf.\n\nTurn three: Forest, Bog Down with kicker, sacrificing Dryad Arbor and Vault of Whispers.\n\nNow you've got a creature, an artifact, a land, and a sorcery in your graveyard, making your Tarmogoyf a 4/5 beater. Your opponent probably discarded an instant, a copy of Bound in Silence, and, uh, a planeswalker card, making your Tarmogoyf an 8/9. Not bad for turn three.\n\nRarely Good 2010:\n\nEvery set has some rares that take a while (sometimes forever) to get the respect they deserve. It's my job to help speed up that process. Let's rock and roll, shall we? (Feel free to rhythm and blues or country and western if that's more your style.)\n\nIf there's one thing I like to cut, besides class and the mustard, it's a wide swath of destruction.\n\nIt has long been the case that cards with a brutal drawback are the domain of Johnny. After all, it is Johnny who likes to work with the raw materials that no one else will touch. These cards are the plutonium of Magic. You need a little ingenuity to harness their power, but if you can do it, the effect will be lethal for your opponent. If not, you will just die from radiation sickness. That analogy apparently had a half-life of one sentence. My apologies.\n\nI wrote about a very spicy little number sent to me by Noel deCordova. His deck featured the storm-enabling Grinning Ignus, the X-spell-enabling Gauntlet of Power, and perhaps a few too many heartburn-enabling jalapeños. Well, it just so happens that two of those three things fit in perfectly with the cards we've already assembled (Sorry, jalapeños!)\n\nElf Employment:\n\nWelcome to ELF Week! Today we're going to look at ELF, the Executable and Linking Format (formerly called the Extensible Linking Format), which is apparently a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps.\n\nWhoops. What I meant to say was: Welcome to Elf Week!\n\nFive and half years is a long time. During the time of the Great Elf-Shunning, my entire wardrobe went out of style (and stayed there), my favourite band got together and then broke up, and that carton of milk in my fridge probably expired. I'll leave it to my roommate to test that hypothesis.\n\nThe next creature-type to get its own week was Squirrels, which, other than our friend Mistform Ultimus, are entirely green. On the one hand, they definitely get some points for palling around with their elf-master, Deranged Hermit. On the other hand, I had to deduct some cool points for being one of the few so-called magical creatures that currently live in my backyard. I don't have any Leviathans, Elementals, or Kavu in my backyard (that I know of), so those types just have a little more cachet.\n\n50 Ways to Lord of Leaves Your Lover\n\n\"Check out this new elf, Riftsweeper.\"\n\n\"Neat.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's no Mongrel, but it's still a decent bear.\"\n\n\"I thought you said it was an elf?\"\n\n\"It is, but it's a 2/2 for two.\"\n\n\"A tutu for two? That sounds...uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"It's a Grizzly Bears with an ability.\"\n\n\"Um, don't all grizzly bears have abilities? Like, the ability to spear salmon with their bare claws and the ability to maul unsuspecting hikers in the Appalachians?\"\n\n\"No, Grizzly Bears are vanilla.\"\n\n\"You mean, like, the flavour?\"\n\n\"No, the flavour is that it's a magical bear from the land of Dominia.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"It's vanilla because it has no abilities. The Humble Budoka, however, is French vanilla because it has shroud.\"\n\n\"It has shroud? That's not even English. What are you, Tarzan?\"\n\n\"Shroud is an ability. It means that the monk can't be targeted. You can't ping it, burn it, Boomerang it, provoke it, Swords it, or put fat-pants on it.\"\n\n\"But I can put pants on a grizzly bear because it's vanilla?\"\n\n\"Now you're getting it!\"\n\n\"So what's Riftsweeper, then? English-toffee cappuccino?\"\n\n\"It's a suspend hoser.\"\n\n\"That sounds like something that old people would wear.\"\n\n\"Suspend is the block mechanic.\"\n\n\"A guy named Rusty is my block's mechanic.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't just hose suspend. You can use on anything that's been RFG'd.\"\n\n\"I've gotta admit, I'm RFC'd right now: Really Freakin' Confused.\"\n\n\"Why don't I just show you a deck?\"\n\n\"Finally!\"\n\nGold, Silver, and Black:\n\nWelcome to my humble abode! It's made of cards, as you can see, so the \"humble\" part kind of goes without saying. Cards are not the most durable building material of all time.\n\nWhile you can't really build a house with cards, you can certainly build a deck, which is, coincidentally, what I'm going to do now.\n\nBefore I do that, however, I'm going to kick things off with arguably the worst play on words of all time. Here goes.\n\nAkroma, Is Statue?\n\nI was somewhat disappointed to learn that Akroma's Memorial didn't end up being part of a cycle. To remedy this unfortunate situation, from now on I'm going to refer to Gruul War Plow as Iwamori's Memorial, Bubble Matrix will be Cho-Manno's Memorial, Ankh of Mishra will be christened Zo-Zu's Memorial, Charcoal Diamond will be known as Riven Turnbull's Memorial, and a blank piece of paper will be Sir Shandlar of Eberyn's Memorial. Could you ask for a better tribute?\n\nAkroma's Memorial has a mana cost that chronic dictionary users might call \"exorbitant.\" Those less familiar with the usefulness of dictionaries might say that it has an \"absorbent\" mana cost, but I won't (will) hold it against them. No matter what you call it, seven is a lot of mana to pay. For that much mana, I need the card to win me the game roughly 130% of the time all by itself. Akroma's Memorial just can't do that, unless you do something crazy like turn it into a creature with a card like March of the Machines. But who would want to do that?\n\nUh, I would.\n\nOf course, twenty mana is a lot. It's surprisingly more than seven. If you're going to pay that much you should win 400% of the time. While my Timmy-half generally approves of such unbridled overkill, my Spike-half knows that this plan is just not feasible. Luckily, my Johnny-half came up with a way to cheat all of these expensive artifacts into play, while my Melvin-half complained that I can't be divided into four halves.\n\nAkroma's Memorial gives all of your creatures seven keyword abilities. The next card I'm going to look at gives one of your creatures one of those abilities. The card is Arcanum Wings, and it's notable for being twice as expensive as one of the worst cards with a zebra in the artwork ever made: Flight. Why the price-hike? Is it because of the name-brand label? Who wants to be the lamoid zebra wearing plain old Flight, when all the cool kids are decked out in Arcanum Wings?\n\nIt's always nice to get your auras at a discount, and Evan traded his designer Wings for a pair of fungal fat-pants like Verdant Embrace and some, uh, life-saving pants like Fool's Demise (a nice thing to trade for in response to removal).\n\nReach for the Scry:\n\nHowdy, Johnnies. It's Scry Week! I bet you didn't see that coming.\n\nMonkeying with the top and/or bottom of the library has always been profitable for the Johnny, so coming up with deck ideas was the easy part. The difficulty was in devising the article subheadings, which usually combine a random pop-culture reference with an appalling play on words. Since Mark took all the good ones (I was really set on using \"Scry, the Beloved Country\"), I was left with:\n\nBoys Don't Scry\n\nNo Woman, No Scry\n\nGoodbye, Blue Scry\n\nThe Boy Who Scryed Wolf\n\nA Scry in the Dark\n\nDon't Scry for Me, Argentina\n\nIt's My Way or the Scry-way\n\nYikes. I had to use the MasterCraft cordless Barrel-Bottom Scraper (that I bought at Canadian Tire) to come up with those. The ones that eventually made the grade aren't much better, so be warned.\n\nYou can't write a Scry Week column without mentioning the new Scry King, the latest Scry Captain of the World of Tomorrow, the Scryborg him- or herself: Cryptic Annelid. This guy's sort of like a Foresee with a four-butt that lets you dig six-deep.If that kind of one-shot amazacrazy scryin' doesn't set your heart afire, just imagine turning that one-shot into a two- or three-shot of draw-smoothing, deck-stacking goodness.\n\nIt really was not a good deck, since it had something like a single-digit win percentage (I'll let you guess which digit)\n\nSpeculating in Futures:\n\nWelcome Johnnies, Timmies, Spikes, Melvins, Vorthoses, Reginalds, Archibalds, and/or Jugheads! Phew! Thats a lot of you to keep track of. Im glad Im not in marketing.\n\nIn my civilian life, I happen to like all fictitious Magic players equally. When Im wearing my House of Cards hat, however, Im obliged to like Johnnies more than others. Many apologies to all you slighted Reggies and Archies out there. If you existed, I would feel your pain.\n\nAll you have to do (at least if youre me, though it seems unlikely that you are)\n\nThese days, its almost too easy to live above your means. You can get just about anything on credit, from food and drinks to furniture to really strange stuff like Magic singles. With the release of Future Sight, you can add Counterspell, Reverse Damage, Dark Banishing, a narrower Eladamris Call, and red Durkwood Boars tokens to the list of things you buy now and pay for later. Im referring, of course, to the Pact cycle (Action Pact, Jam Pact, Pact Lunch, Vacuum Pact, and Pact House)\n\nAh, Tolaria West! A fine tutor as well as my favourite silent-movie actress.\n\nIf you play this deck, dont make the same mistake I did. Pact of the Titan says you have to put a Giant creature token into play. Forget about dinky little Pro Player cards, dice, or beads. Ive been using refrigerator boxes. Perhaps Im being too literal. All I know is that Im running out of room in my apartment. Its a good thing I dont have to pay for these fridges until 2009.\n\nNot content to let everyone else muck about with space-time, reader Alex Churchill flexed some Johnny muscle, time-crafted a deck, and wrote: Hello! I thought you might like to see this time counters deck Ive created since the prerelease, using some Future Sight cards. It can do some pretty funky things: for example, pay 3U for a Wrath of God every turn, or prevent me from being attacked again for the rest of the game.\n\nThat's me!\n\nThe second combo involves Chronomantic Escape and some number of Clockspinnings, Paradox Hazes, Jhoiras Timebugs, and/or other Chronomantic Escapes. As someone who once tried to abuse Moment of Silence in a pre-Isochron Scepter world (with, I believe, Scrivener and Erratic Portal), seeing this combo was like reuniting with an old friend. A cranky old friend who annoys everyone else at the table, but a friend nonetheless.\n\nSprout Swarm makes green Saproling tokens (thank god theyre not Giant Saprolings)\n\nAh, Muraganda Petroglyphs! A fine token-pumper, as well as my second-favourite silent-movie actress.\n\nBaby Grands:\n\nGravestorm is what you get when you cross storm from Scourge with stuff going to the graveyard from play. I honestly don't know how they came up with the name for this mechanic. Personally, I would've called it grumplicate, but to each his own.\n\nWhite is famous for its love of law and order. You get a bunch of sentient cats and elephants together, and they just can't stop themselves from drafting up some new laws.\n\nThe latest of white's rules-setting creatures, Aven Mindcensor, a card that puts a damper on your opponent's ability to search through libraries. It's like the exact opposite of the Dewey decimal system.\n\nYou know who else likes life gain? Ageless Entity. A 44/44 Entity is nothing to sneeze at, but your opponent might want to reach for a hanky when you give it trample with Baru, Fist of Krosa.\n\nWerebear (which I just typed as \"Werebeard\" for some reason, which would probably still be an awesome creature)\n\nThere Is No Eye In Team:\n\nAs you probably all know, Future Sight is almost upon us. At the time of this writing (Spring, 1974), the complete spoiler, sortable or not, is not yet available. Since I can't see into the future, I figured I'd do the next best thing and consult those who (probably) can. I'm talking about giant floating eyeballs. Incognito, oxymoronic planeswalkers. Watchers. You know, creatures and players with extraordinary vision.\n\nHailing from Orms-by-Gore, a sort of Stratford-upon-Avon for the monocular set\n\nA Conspiracy set to Eye will make your Slivers, how do you say, suboptimal. They'll be creatures with the Eye subtype, but they'll still give their abilities to other Slivers. Of course, you won't have any of those any more. You're basically left with a bunch of Grizzly Bears, Gray Ogres, and vanilla 2/2s for four and 3/3s for six, which thankfully aren't common enough to warrant a nickname yet.\n\nInvasion rare Blind Seer. Apparently, this guy is actually Urza in disguise. This should not come as a surprise, since about half the artifacts in Magic history represent Urza's eyewear. Glasses of Urza, Sunglasses of Urza, Urza's Contact Lenses... The list goes on and on. Or stops right there.\n\nIn any case, Blind Seer has a sort of sixth-sense when it comes to avoiding the Spreading Plague. You can use ol' Urza to thwart any funny stuff from your opponent, like trying to get away with playing creatures that don't share a colour.\n\nNot very long ago, in a galaxy far, far closer than you might expect, a helpful mage by the name of Redland Jack sent me an interesting decklist.\n\nGibber Jabber:\n\nKiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and the Betrayers of Kamigawa ninjas teamed up with the Rishadan pirates to form what is arguably the greatest ninja-pirate deck ever featured in my column.\n\nTerritorial Dispute, one of the most busted cards ever printed if you only read the first half of the card\n\nWe get to see the interaction of lots of mechanics from the history of the game in the same block.\n\nPicture it: Convoke and Buyback. Madness and Cycling. Buyback and Storm. Third Strike and Phases with Others (Note: Not actual mechanics).\n\nLike a half-man, half-dog, my preview is its own best friend.\n\nI could be wrong, but I think the most likely place to which one would descend (while gibbering) would be the fiery depths of heck. H-E-Double-hockey-sticks. They have plenty of fire there, tons of Madness, and I hear the guy who's in charge wields an axe made of frickin' lightning (or at least he or she should). Gibbering Descent enables the Madness of both Fiery Temper and Violent Eruption, and is in turned enabled by Lightning Axe, Kindle the Carnage, Rix Maadi, Dungeon Palace, and the Great Dame of Flame herself, Jaya Ballard, Task Mage. All of these cards accelerate you to Hellbent, which is a nice place to be if you're a Magus of the Scroll or an anthropomorphized Demonfire.\n\nRazormane Masticore has an almost uncanny symbiosis with Gibbering Descent. It has a pretty steep upkeep cost, but that cost is discarding a card which conveniently provides you with a Madness outlet for Gibbering Descent. By the time you have no more cards in hand and therefore can no longer pay that cost, you will be skipping your upkeep anyway! It's like the opposite of a Catch-22. Or something.\n\nFree-Spell Necro(mancy):\n\nFor those of you who just want to see the neat new card (and I promise it is all three of those things)\n\nNow, in the speculative future of Future Sight, each colour's timeshifted cards don't just show off some piece of the pie that they used to have, or simply trade pieces of pie with another colour. This is more like some fancy, new and improved pie, made with a dash of necroleum and a pinch of cryo. It's a freaky post-apocalyptic mutant pie.\n\nHow would you like to halve your opponent's life total whenever you played, say, a Sleight of Hand?\n\nIs this your card? 10 to the dome.\n\nIs this your card? 10 to the dome.\n\nRarely Good: The College Years:\n\nDanish deck designer Christian M. sent me a deck that finally provided an answer to the eternal question: \"What do you get when you cross Wild Pair with Elf-Ball?\" I always thought the answer was \"lowbrow humour,\" but apparently I was wrong.\n\nNot every card can be as damnable as Damnation or as groundbreaking as Groundbreaker or as silly-sounding as Shivan Wumpus\n\nI wonder what would happen if we combined a win-more card like Roiling Horror with a bunch of win-less cards? Surely, they would have to balance each other out and leave me with a win-some deck.\n\nFat, Old, and Firebreathing:\n\nFor the past couple of days, we've been celebrating the pleasantly plump, the Rubenesque, the euphemistically-endowed  what we in the Magic world rather uncharitably call \"fatties.\"\n\nI like high-toughness creatures and I cannot lie. And not just green fatties, either. I don't care if you're red, black, purple, or green. Well, if you're purple, I don't think I could fit you into a Magic deck. At least not yet.\n\nThe focus of the format is fun. If that's not enough f's for you, then I ought to tell you that a large part of the fun comes from flailing at each other with freakin' fatties.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at the format  including discussion of its rules, variants, strategies, and banned list  feel free to visit the home of EDH on the web, which is conveniently linked to one of the words in this sentence.\n\nWho Drinks the Blood of the Blood-Drinkers?\n\n1 Novijen Sages\n\nThis was Sheldon's suggestion and I think it's brilliant. The card isn't bad on its own, but once your vampires (especially Szadek) start accumulating counters, the Sages become quite amusing. Your vampires drain the life-force of your enemies, while the mutant advisors do their thing and drain the life-force of your vampires.\n\nWon't You Take Me To Monkeytown?:\n\nI trust everyone had a lovely weekend celebrating St. Patrick's Day. Being 1/512th Irish, it's perhaps my favourite March non-holiday. When else can you wear an emerald-sequined top hat and imbibe frosty beverages containing a near-lethal dose of green dye? I mean, without looking like you just bombed an audition for your community theatre's production of Alice in Wonderland?\n\nRumour has it that St. Patrick's main claim to fame is that he banished all the snakes from Ireland. How, you ask? Well, if The Simpsons has taught us anything, it's that the way to deal with an out-of-control snake population is to let loose a pack of gorillas with a predilection for snake meat.\n\n\"Now,\" I hear you asking, \"where am I supposed to get all these asp-munching apes, Mr. Millar? They don't grow on trees, you know.\"\n\nEr, actually, they do.\n\nBut, hey, whatever floats your boat. I'm no connoisseur of boat-floating, but I know what I like. And that's making a ton of monkey tokens all in one shot.\n\nUnfortunately, Brand isn't available on MTGO  where all the best screen shots are found  so I figured I'd try the next best thing (which is actually nowhere near as good): Peer Pressure. I wouldn't have thought that Apes were vulnerable to peer pressure, but I guess that explains how all those poor chimps end up smoking cigarettes. Or not.\n\nThe lesson: Don't be greedy! Make Apes now, so you don't die to a bunch of dragons later. I believe that was Confucius.\n\nHey, if you're gonna lose, you might as well lose to monkeys. That's what I always say.\n\nYodels, Inc.:\n\nStop me if you've heard this one: Welcome to Echo Week! To be honest, I was a little unsure about what I was going to do for the theme this week. My first instinct was to just rerun my article from last week  har har  but apparently that wouldn't have resulted in a similar echoing in my bank account. My second instinct was to yodel my article from the Swiss Alps, but apparently I don't live anywhere near the Swiss Alps and I don't know how to yodel. Once I work out these kinks, expect a belated Echo Week podcast from me. Until then, I'll have to come up with something else.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I like me a Man-o'-War. Have I mentioned that anywhere before? Besides every third article?\n\nGiven my (unrequited) love for the betentacled bouncer\n\nNow, of all the silly weapons employed by goblins throughout the years  like rocks, kites, flamesticks, and something called a charbelcher  fighting off your enemies with a marine invertebrate nailed to a twig has got to be the most absurd. On second thought, maybe it's not such an incongruous pairing, since goblins and jellyfish do have one thing in common: They both lack a brain.\n\nKaervek has never been a very friendly fellow. He has a tendency to spite, purge, and/or torch things without a modicum of compassion, an iota of kindness, or a shred of clemency.\n\nFortunately, he and Stingscourger have really hit it off. Maybe it's their mutual love of jellyfish-based melee weapons\n\nWhat's more natural than a team-up between a lava-spewing tentacle with tentacles and an indestructible puppet? Nothing I can think of.\n\nLuckily, Volcano Hellion still has a few tricks up its sleeve. Or at least it would, if it could find some suitable shirts at Dominaria's Big and Tentacled Clothing Store.\n\n\"Playing Volcano Hellion knowing you have an Angel's Grace ready to go allows you to be stylish. Say... Impersonate Dr. Evil with a pinkie raised to the corner of your mouth and say 'I choose one ... meeellion ... damage! Mwahahahaha!'\"\n\nDuring my long sojourn, hunting for (and Gatherer-ing) Volcano Hellion combos, I stumbled upon a couple of six-legged freaks that seem like they wouldn't mind having liquid-hot magma spat upon them. I'm talking, of course, about Broodhatch Nantuko and Bennie Smith's beloved Saber Ants.\n\nIn the absence of either of your little flea-factories, you can suit up one of your other insects with Druid's Call and have your Hellion magically turn lava into squirrels, which is truly a neat trick.\n\nAcridian is an insect with echo, so including it was like a goblin and a jellyfish: a complete no-brainer.\n\nYukora the Paroled:\n\nLiving with a houseful of gamers is the first step towards a full-blown game addiction. I won't say that it had a, uh, deleterious effect on my education (after all, I can apparently use the word \"deleterious\" without embarrassment)\n\nThe great thing about this format is that if you enter once, you can basically \"go infinite\" by resubmitting the 45 cards you drafted last time. Reduce, reuse, Null Profusion, as I like to say. (I'm allowed to recycle Null Profusion jokes.)\n\nCaribou Range + Hour of Reckoning: This isn't really a \"combo.\" It's more of a \"nice interaction.\" You can stall the ground with your caribou tokens, forcing your opponent to commit creatures to the board in order to bust through your antlered army. Then use your white caribou tokens to convoke out Selesnya's Wrath of God. Okay, that's not even close to a combo. I included it here mostly because it makes me chuckle to think that caribou would be spared in the hour of reckoning. (We didn't put one on the Canadian quarter for nothing.)\n\nJust add some creatures with protection from red (like Subterranean Spirit), or some task mages (like Jaya Ballard), and go to town. While you're there, can you pick me up some eggs and milk?\n\nStorm Herd + Flame Fusillade: If you looked in the dictionary under \"overkill,\" you might find this pair of cards.\n\nIf your opponent isn't playing black, the Blightcutter is just a green Gray Ogre, blockable and, uh, normous. However, with Blind Seer using his other four (super-heightened) senses to redecorate the world, your opponent will always be playing black.\n\nI got an early Humility and dominated the board wi"
