        "text": "Alps Alpine Electrostatic Technologies: Building a new relationship between humans and machines\n\nThe touch-screen device has become familiar to us all with the spread of smartphones. The technology that goes into detecting a finger touching a screen is called Electrostatic technology. Electrostatic technology involves detecting the electrical change (the change in capacitance) that occurs from contact with the human body. Various things are manipulated with the help of an embedded sensor in the touchscreen that senses location and movement.\n\nAt Alps Alpine, we develop a variety of \"touch to move\" devices, such as touchpads on laptops, controllers for video game consoles, and touch panels in automobiles. This technology is evolving towards a touchless control next-generation input experience and other next-generation sensors such as hands-off detection built into steering wheels.\n\nAlps Alpine Electrostatic Technologies: Developed from computer input devices\n\nThe touchpad is widely known as a human machine interface (HMI) device that makes use of Electrostatic technology. HMI is an interface that links people to machines and includes buttons, switches, keyboards, and mice.\n\nAlps Alpine developed Japan’s first domestically produced mouse in 1983, and would go on to utilize computers to develop various devices. In 1994, we acquired licensing from Cirque Corporation, an American leader in Electrostatic technology that released GlidePoint™, the first touchpad. In 2023, Cirque was made into a subsidiary where both companies’ technologies were combined and used to create more advanced precision sensing technology. These were incorporated into products such as the Touch Motion Sensor™ for use in pet robots, and the GlideSensor™, which is used in mobile devices. In 2004, we further evolved the resistive touch panels we marketed to develop capacitive touch panels, and have made progress in commercializing them with a focus on mobile products, such as smartphones.\n\nGlidePoint™, GlideSensor™, Touch Motion Sensor™\n\nFollowing that, we made effective use of our experience in consumer electronics, actively working on researching and developing touchpads for use in automobiles. In 2010, we cleared issues of sound and environment proofing, and announced we were developing a revolutionary automobile touchscreen.\n\nImplementing Space Detection and Realizing Touch-free Control with AirInput™\n\nAirInput™ uses a sensor with a design optimized for the locations in which it is mounted, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that greatly influences the performance limits of capacitance detection, and algorithms that analyze detected data and solve problems. Alps Alpine’s strengths can be seen in how we created an optimal solution for these three essential elements of Electrostatic technologies. Alps Alpine was the first in the industry to develop an IC that is overwhelmingly noise-proof. In addition to being able to detect touch even when the user is wearing gloves, it can detect multiple locations simultaneously, and can even detect hands from a distance of more than 10 cm away from the screen.\n\nAirInput™ Module\n\nThe AirInput™ Module represents the culmination of Alps Alpine’s Electrostatic technology. It comes equipped with functions that allow it to sense subtle finger movements such as moving closer and moving away. It makes possible a new type of input that can be operated in the air rather than by touch. This technology can be used in medical and nursing care facilities that adhere to the strictest standards of hygiene. It also can be applied in places such as public transportation, restrooms, elevators, and ATMs, since this technology allows individuals who may have water, oil, or medicine on their hands to interact with panels without touching them, helping to make life in society safer, more secure, and more comfortable.\n\nPremium HMI, a New Dimension in Automobile Interiors\n\nThe Electrostatic technology of today is mainly used in surface-level, aesthetic functions, but it is expected to expand to 3-D functionality. If a sensor were to be placed in a grip or handle-shaped device, for example, it could lead to input methods that have never been seen before.\n\nAlps Alpine is advancing the development of Premium HMI in the automotive field. Premium HMI high-quality human machine interface that provides comfortable operation with a feeling of excellence. By combining Alps Alpine’s printing technologies with the evolution of Electrostatic technologies, we can create input controls for air conditioning and audio volume using surface layers and illuminated devices that reproduce the texture of wood, leather, and fabrics. Amidst the advance of flat automobile interior design, our Premium HMI, with its intuitive operation and outstanding aesthetics, has the potential to create the next-generation mobility experience.\n\nAdditionally, we are working to accelerate research and development to expand the range of applications for Premium HMI, bringing the technology from vehicle interiors to regular households and public settings by continually furthering the evolution of high sensitivity Electrostatic technology and improving mid-air detection.\n\nAlps Alpine’s Electrostatic technology will create a lifestyle of comfortable connection between people and technology as it expands its range of applications."
