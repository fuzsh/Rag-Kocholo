Please note that production, sales and programs may be terminated or contents such as specifications and prices may be modified by the time you read this information.\n\nAlps Electric to Exhibit at Sensors Expo 2018\n\nIntroducing IoT Sensor Network Modules and a Virtual Reality Solution\n\nAlps Electric Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 6770; President: Toshihiro Kuriyama) will be exhibiting at Sensors Expo 2018, the industry’s largest show, on June 26 through 28 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, USA.\n\nAlps Electric will be exhibiting at Sensors Expo 2018 and presenting their sensing devices for IoT and automotive. This year, Cirque Corporation, a subsidiary of Alps Electric will also exhibit their VR Grip™ at the ALPS booth.\n\n＜Exhibit Highlight: IoT Smart Modules＞\n\nIntegrating low-power, high-precision and compact sensors with a Bluetooth® communication module, these products are capable of acquiring pressure, temperature, humidity, ambient light and other environmental data, as well as six-axis (geomagnetism + acceleration) sensing.\n\nA special app (for Android) is available for viewing data and changing sensing settings on a smartphone or tablet. In addition, radio certification has already been acquired for various regions around the world, allowing smooth, low-cost progression to demonstration testing.\n\nAt Sensors Expo 2018, we will also exhibit a Function Expansion Type enabling connection of an extra sensor.\n\n＜Exhibit Highlight: VR Grip™ Platform＞\n\nVR Grip™ is Cirque’s finger position proximity sensing device with a high-resolution circle trackpad. This solution transforms a virtual reality controller, joystick or game controller into a fully touch sensitive surface.\n\nIn addition to tracking a user’s hand and fingers on the controller surface, proximity sensing also tracks finger position in the open space above the controller surface. This provides functionality similar to a glove tracking system, while maintaining the direct tactile feedback and trigger control of a controller. Unique custom flexible sensors allow this solution to fit into almost any industrial design.\n\n【Outline of the Exhibition】\n\nDates June 27-28, 2018 Venue McEnery Convention Center, San Jose, CA, United States Booth No. 916 (900 Aisle) Other Demonstrations\n\nMagnetic Steering Angle Sensor\n\nCoreless Current Sensor for Automotive\n\nAbout Alps Electric Co., Ltd.\n\nAlps Electric (Tokyo: 6770) is a leading global manufacturer of high-quality electronic components for mobi le devices, home electronics, vehicles and industrial equipment. With the philosophy of “Perfecting the Art of Electronics,” Alps Electric supplies over 40,000 different components to about 2,000 companies all over the world.
