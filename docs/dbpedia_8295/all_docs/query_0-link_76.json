If at least $25,000 is raised, El Paso financial institution WestStar will match the donations.\n\nThe community still has an opportunity to contribute to student scholarships and get a chance to win a new 2021 Ford F-150 truck with the FX4 Off-Road package, valued at $55,075.

Six hundred raffle tickets will be sold, and tickets are $200 each or three for $500.\n\nThe winner will be announced via Facebook Live during the Cirque de Corazón event. Raffle tickets can be purchased at\n\nRELATED:\n\nWe’re putting new nurses into our region’s hospitals two years sooner than most. This is life-changing, not only for students and their families but for the community, which faces a severe shortage of nurses,” said Dr. Stephanie Woods, Ph.D., R.N. dean of the Hunt School of Nursing. “But first, we have to ensure that talented local students have everything they need to successfully complete our nursing program. Having a scholarship means students worry less about having to work a full-time job while going through school, and can concentrate on becoming the compassionate, highly skilled nurses we know they can be.\n\nTo date, the Hunt School of Nursing has graduated more than 1,000 students, with a majority of those graduates staying in the region."
