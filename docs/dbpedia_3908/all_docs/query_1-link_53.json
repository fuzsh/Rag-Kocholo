        "text": "Over the course of 30-plus years in studios, Mike sharpened his sonic vision by working both sides of the booth, initially as a musician and later as an engineer and producer.\n\nThrough three decades, he developed his expertise on the drums and guitar while climbing the recording ranks. Beginning at the renowned House of Music in West Orange, NJ, and subsequently at the tri-state’s finest studios, Mike honed his skills working alongside some of the industry’s most talented producers, engineers, and musicians.\n\nMoreover, he applies the same skills and passion to his work on voice-overs, sound design, broadcast TV and radio ads, TV shows, indie films, and more."
