        "text": "Elvis Presley – As Recorded at Madison Square Garden\n\nFebruary 27, 2019\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nOVERALL (OUT OF 10): 4\n\nNot that the world for any reason deserved it, but one fine day in 1935 God was feeling generous and sent a wonderous gift to world that happened to land in Tupelo, Mississippi, and grew to be the greatest musical force ever produced in the Western Hemisphere (rivaled only by four lads from Liverpool on the other side of the Atlantic). About twenty years later Satan, seeing all the beauty and joy this gift was giving to the world, couldn’t stand it anymore and appeared in the guise of Colonel Tom Parker to take the gift away. But such was the power of the gift that it took the Devil more than two decades to completely kill it, and over those years much of its beauty still shone through in spite of The Evil One’s best efforts. Oh, Elvis – what you could have been in a Colonel Tom Parker-less world. I visited Graceland for the first time a few months ago, and spent some time sitting by his grave, and I have to say, it was an unexpectedly spiritual experience. I didn’t see it coming, but there was something moving about being a mere few feet from what remains of such an amazing amount of God-given talent – talent that due to the machinations of the Devil was often needlessly squandered and criminally underused. You cannot tell me there is no such thing as God and the Devil in a world where Elvis Presley once existed.\n\nElvis’ live albums from the 70s are so frustrating. When he felt like committing to a performance, the guy was phenomenal. And when he really didn’t care to bother much with the performance, he was okayish, but you couldn’t help but be upset at what the performance could have been if he’d been able to motivate himself a little bit.\n\n1972’s As Recorded at Madison Square Garden is probably the best example of this. The chronology of Elvis live albums tells a tragic story. RCA released Elvis live albums at a truly head spinning rate in the 70s, and the rule of thumb generally is the earlier the better (Aloha From Hawaii being the sole exception). 1969’s In Person at the International Hotel and 1970’s On Stage captured a hungry, energized, lean mean Elvis dedicated to earning his reputation back – he takes no prisoners and grants no quarter on most of the performances on these albums. He’s also capeless on these albums, which is a plus even if you can’t see it, because another rule of thumb is that the presence of a cape does not bode well for an Elvis performance (after all, a cape, really? Was he planning to shout “up, up, and away!” at the end of the performance and fly out of the venue or something?). The cape was a symbol of the sad self-parody Elvis had become, and marked the point where his descent into becoming a running musical gag was complete. It was a sign Elvis had finally embraced the camp and the cheese and had forever given up in despair that he would ever again be a serious artist. And on Madison Square Garden, we get the caped crusader on cruise control for the most part. However, the next album, Aloha from Hawaii was a mighty last stand before the slide into irrelevant mediocrity – some fans decry the lack of hip swiveling and karate kicking in Elvis’ performance on Aloha, due in no small measure to the downers he’d taken to calm his nerves before going onstage before a worldwide satellite audience. But if his movements were lethargic, his vocals were energetic, giving us a final glimpse of the force of nature he once was. From a vocal standpoint, Elvis was on top of his game for most of the songs on Aloha, and I personally think it holds its own against his first two live albums. You couldn’t have seen him karate kick on the album anyway, and besides, it looked kind of stupid sometimes, especially as he got older and considerably less, ahem, athletic. But as Elvis live albums go, Aloha was the last triumph. Things went downhill fast after that – other than a jaw dropping performance of “How Great Thou Art”, 1974’s Recorded Live Onstage in Memphis was eminently forgettable. There were a couple of Elvis live album-less years after that, but then when Elvis In Concert was born in 1977, its first words were “Aw, crap, why did I have to be the worst live Elvis album?” Then Having Fun with Elvis Onstage piped up and said “Hey, I’m right over here, did you forget about me or something?” Aloha from Hawaii is the only interruption in a linear decline from classic to cringe in the Elvis live albums discography.\n\nSquarely in the middle of this decline chronologically, As Recorded at Madison Square Garden falls somewhere between the best and the worst of the live Elvis albums. It doesn’t have the leather suited electric crackle of In Person, but doesn’t have the bloated, exhausted, worn out “you’ll have to excuse me, after all I’ll be dead in a few weeks” vibe of Elvis In Concert. There are moments when he sounds as committed and engaged as ever, and moments where he sounds like he’d almost rather be anyplace in the universe besides Madison Square Garden – and sometimes these moments come right after each other. On the “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear” / “Don’t Be Cruel” medley and the subsequent “Love Me Tender” Elvis sings with all the energy and passion of a stale tuna sandwich, kind of mumbling his way through the songs as if to say “yeah, I’m too cool to bother much with singing these boring old songs”. It was like he had to have some songs from the 50s in the set, and he was trying to get it over with with as little effort as possible. But then immediately afterwards he launches into “The Impossible Dream” with an emotional, roaring, full-throated vocal that says “whatever else I might have done tonight, I am giving this song my all”. Simply majestic. Rarely do I hear this version without hitting the repeat button.\n\nPart of the problem with the album is that so many of these songs had already been included on In Person, On Stage, and the live tracks on That’s the Way It Is in much better versions. “Proud Mary”, “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me”, “You’ve Lost that Loving Feeling”, and “Polk Salad Annie” in particular had already been released in versions which boasted far more energetic, exciting vocal performances from the King – on Madison Square Garden, Elvis was phoning it in by comparison. If you’ve never watched the movie “That’s the Way it Is” (special edition, of course), you’ve never seen what Elvis is capable of – and it throws into perspective how far below his potential the New York shows really were. Having clawed his way back back to the top, he was going to just relax and enjoy the view for a while.\n\nIn Person and On Stage were the sound of Elvis working hard to win his audience’s approval, proving he was still the master entertainer who could keep the eyes of every female in the audience glued to his every move, all the while giving it his all vocally. As Recorded at Madison Square Garden is the first live album where we hear Elvis taking his audience for granted – he expects them to like him, and consequently doesn’t feel like he needs to work as hard. After a couple of years performing live the screams, the squeals of delight, and the rapturous applause were no longer something he felt like he had to earn – no matter what he did, they’d be his for the taking anyway. So unless a song really caught his fancy, he didn’t feel like he had to work too hard. On a couple of them he even switches back and forth from bored to energetic mid-song – for example, he sounds so sleepy and unengaged you can hardly hear him in the first part of “Never Been to Spain”, but then when the octave jump comes in partway through the song there’s a fire to his singing that seems to come right out of nowhere. On most of the songs on the album he never really wakes up though. With “The Impossible Dream” he felt like giving his all, but that was the exception – more typical is “Funny How Time Slips Away”, sung in a half-hearted, casual manner as though he didn’t really feel like putting much into it.\n\n“For the Good Times”, on the other hand, sounds like Elvis actually cares about how he sounds, and we finally get to hear a little emotion from him. The same was always true of “An American Trilogy”, and as was the case for every performance I ever heard of it, Elvis gives it a force and power that I can only assume reflected his strong feelings of patriotism and “proud-to-be-an-Americanism”. And he must have really liked “Suspicious Minds”, I never heard him give a half-hearted performance of that song either, the version here holds its own with every other version on almost every other Elvis live album of the 70s.\n\nBut far too often you can tell Elvis isn’t that interested in what he’s singing. Madison Square Garden pales in comparison to the next live album, Aloha from Hawaii. He may not have moved around on stage much for the Aloha concert, but it featured far more of Elvis’ trademark passionate, powerful vocal moments than Madison Square Garden. “You Gave Me a Mountain”, “My Way”, “Steamroller Blues”, and “What Now My Love” all have those grand, majestic vocal moments that were only found sparingly at Madison Square Garden. “Burning Love” on Aloha has a far superior vocal to the studio version, which I always found anemic, I always figured Elvis must have been sick the day he recorded it. You can make a direct comparison between “I’ll Remember You” between the two albums, and the one on Aloha is on a whole other level than this one, the vocal on last verse on the version from Aloha is an atom bomb explosion. I’ll never understand people who think Madison Square Garden is the better album, Aloha easily has far more of those powerful Elvis vocal moments, there are only a couple of 50s throwaway performances, and nothing on Madison Square Garden is half so steamy as “Fever” on Aloha.\n\nBut the most egregious sin of the entire fifty-two minutes at Madison Square Garden that night was unfortunately not endemic to this album, but was a repeated atrocity at the end of every show Elvis gave from 1969 on – the sacrilegious, sped up, camped up version of “Can’t Help Falling in Love”. The original is one of the greatest songs ever – in this version Elvis managed to distill everything that was truly awful about pop music in the 70s into a mere one minute and forty-one seconds. The stately grace of the piano in the opening moments of the classic version is bartered for loud, wooden, rushed pounding on the piano keys – Glen D. Hardin should have been barred from public performance for the rest of his life for the way he played it. The original is beautiful, thoughtful, almost solemn – this is a sappy overglitzed schmaltz-infested travesty, with blaring horns, cloyingly oversung backing vocals, and a racous, ill-fitting finale. Elvis badly misjudged how the song should be presented live, and it mars the end of most of his live albums from the 70s, besides besmirching the reputation of one of the greatest love songs ever written.\n\nThing is, Elvis had assembled an incredibly tight band, and he wasn’t using them to their full potential. I’ve always liked Ronnie Tutt as a drummer, and Jerry Scheff’s bass playing on the album gives the rhythm section drive, and even a little funk. There’s a reason James Burton was a legend in his own time, Elvis couldn’t have picked a guitarist who suited him better, with his rockabilly roots and swampy Southern rock lead fills. Glen “Lead Fingers” Hardin may not have been the best choice on piano, but on the whole Elvis’ core backing band was pretty hot. For some reason he opted to slather over them not one but two different groups of backup singers, who were sometimes effective and sometimes overbearing, but mostly not in the way too much really, and J.D. Sumner’s low vocals could be a marvel to behold at times. I don’t really mind the horns and woodwinds and strings – hey, it was the 70s, you had to expect that in your pop music, and generally I find the arrangements tasteful for the most part. The biggest liability in his backing ensemble was the high pitch caterwauling of Kathy Westmoreland – for some reason Elvis felt like some of his songs needed some nails-on-chalkboard treatment, and Miss Westmoreland was just the thing. But most of time, the only real problem with the performances on this album is one Elvis Aron “I’ll only put some heart into it if I feel like it” Presley.\n\nAnd if Elvis’ performances on Madison Square Garden feel slipshod in a lot of places, Colonel Tom Parker did his darndest to carry that slipshoddity on to the mixing and mastering of the album. Without fail, when faced with the choice between artistic quality and making a quick buck, the Colonel unerringly chose the latter, and Elvis’ legacy suffered considerably for it. In this case, concerned that bootleggers would get their albums out first, the performance was recorded on the evening of June 10, and the album was released on June 18, a mere eight days later. The cover had been pre-printed for the rush-release, the picture on the front wasn’t even from the show. It would be quite a feat to release something so quickly even now in the digital age, but then, it could only mean one thing – they did a rush job on the mixing and mastering. All things considered it doesn’t sound too bad, but the remix of the same performance in the 2012 release Prince from Another Planet is a far superior mix.\n\nBut it’s a superior mix of the same mediocre performance. Don’t bother getting the Prince from Another Planet mix. Don’t bother getting this album. If you want live Elvis, get In Person, On Stage, Aloha from Hawaii, and That’s the Way It Is (the fantastic live cuts on the album are just a part of what makes that album so great). There is absolute no reason to own any other live Elvis album, certainly not this one – unless you want to see Elvis at his absolute best and absolute worst all on one album, and if that’s the case As Recorded at Madison Square Garden is the perfect album for you. It’s like a sonic skirmish in the war between God and the Devil for the soul of Elvis Presley, and I’m afraid that in this battle – and ultimately the war – it’s one time where the Devil won out.\n\n“Elvis’s performance on this cd is the worst ever, ever, ever. I have been an Elvis fan since the Louisana Hayride, have bought lp’s 45’s, and cd’s, and have loved everything that he had done, but this cd is awful. Everything is in double time, (not a musical term, I don’t think), and is just terrible. I would never have bought this recording if I had known that all he seemed to want to do was just get it over with.” – Tommy Tucker, Amazon reviewer"
