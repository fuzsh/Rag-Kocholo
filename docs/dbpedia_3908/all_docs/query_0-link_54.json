        "text": "Music is truly a universal language and we speak it perfectly. If you’re ready to put your Art and Vision first you are in the right place. We can drop names with the best in the world: Mariah Carey, Kendrick Lamar, Future, Pharrell, R Kelly, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Disturbed, Krewella, Smokie Norful, Atlantic, Universal, Warner Brothers, but what really matters is YOUR music and that is what we take into account for EVERY client that walks through our doors. Here, you are not someone’s learning experiment; you will never be given an intern or assistant to record/mix your project. Every song/track is unique and deserves its own special attention and we take the time to listen. We don’t run your music through the digital sausage grinder to end up with flavorless mush. At Pressure Point you will get a tasty full course audio meal for much less than you would expect to pay. Experience the full sonic Universe in a lush acoustically pristine environment. Bring your music to life by putting it in the hands of music people who care as much as you do about your creation. See, Feel and Hear the Pressure Point difference. Inspiration. It’s the basis for your music. Tired of recording in a basement or just as bad, a space that looks like a Hospital? Vibe is everything and your eyes can lead to amazing results for your ears! Be inspired by our Moroccan/Asian influenced décor that sooths the spirit and sounds as great as it looks.\n\nBeginning with 5 unique and sonically different recording spaces that include; a tunable isomorphic wall and a natural stone drum chamber. In addition we are the only recording Studio in the Midwest housing a rare 72 channel fully analog SSL 9000K series mixing console with 24 remote super mic pres. No digital giant mouse here. Our ProTools recording rig is custom and sounds super with Lavry convertors on the front end. And ask about our secret weapon “The Dog” it’s an amazing woof you won’t hear anywhere else.\n\nAs the only studio ever in the Chicago area to be honored as Mix Magazines studio of the year we continue to pride ourselves in bringing great music from all genres’ to the world.\n\nStill want to put your music in the hands of a non-professional who will tell ya it’s cheap and good enough?\n\nStep up to Pressure Point when you are ready for the World to Hear your best."
