The 28.x OBS will work well with newer graphics card drivers 500 not from 400 and older.\n\nI did my research and I can say that the old presets were very well optimized. Recently added presets (they are far from new) work much worse (especially their performance) and I do not share the developers' opinion on adding them. The reason is probably the output of the RTX 4000 with AV1.\n\nYou won't lose anything if you stay on older versions of OBS. I hope that in the future everything will be fixed and optimized."
