        "text": "Billy Joel will end his residency at Madison Square Garden in 2024, performing his last concert in July 2024, MSG Entertainment announced in a press release Thursday.\n\nThe six-time Grammy winnerâs last concert will mark the 150th show of his career at the iconic venue.\n\nâIâm kind of flabbergasted that it lasted as long as it did. My team tells me that we could continue to sell tickets, but ten years, 150 showsâall right already!â Billy Joel said in the release.\n\nâTo our audience, I want to thank them for coming to our shows for this long. Itâs hard to end, even at 150 lifetime shows. I just want to thank everyone for the wonderful thing thatâs happened here,â he said.\n\nJoelâs MSG residency began in January 2014. He played one show per month at the Garden as part of the residency.\n\nThe singerâs first performance at the venue was on Dec. 14, 1978, according to MSG.\n\nTwo banners displayed in MSGâs rafters mark records he holds for âmost consecutive performances by any artistâ and âmost lifetime performances by any artistâ at the venue.\n\nâOn behalf of 8.5 million New Yorkers, congratulations, Billy, on a historic run of sold-out shows at MSG, and thank you for a lifetime of bringing joy to us all.,â Mayor Eric Adams said in the release.\n\nIn 2018, to mark his 100th lifetime performance at the Garden, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo proclaimed July 18 as âBilly Joel Dayâ and honored his legendary career in the music industry and in the state, the release said."
