        "text": "Elvis As Recorded at Madison Square Garden was perfect coup, releasing the Album one week after Elvis appearances. Because the Entertainment magazines appeared monthly and the fan, while he/she read the concert reports, could listen already to the concert at home. As recordet at Madison Square Garden released June 18th 1972 reached no.11 in the US Charts. In UK released 7/72 the album reached no.3 The album cover from \"As recordet at Madison Square Garden\" was originally the \"Standing Room Only\" Cover art. Which should be released somewhere in 1972. On this album, RCA wanted to release studio and live material. Songs like \"It`s over\" and \"You gave me a moutain\" were recorded in february 1972(Las Vegas) for this album. But RCA dropped that \"project\"when the decision was made to record and release Elvis' show at Madison Square Garden. Till August 2002 the album, Elvis As Recorded at Madison Square Garden reached 3X Platinum in the US.\n\nElvis Gold Record Presentation in Las Vegas 1972\n\nFormatTitle/LabelYear Cassette\n\nRCA\n\n1972 CD\n\nRCA\n\n1972 CD\n\nBMG / Sony Music Entertainment\n\n1992 CD\n\nRCA\n\n1992 CD\n\nBMG\n\n1996 CD\n\nAs Recorded at Madison Square Garden\n\nRCA\n\n1997 CD\n\nBMG International\n\n2001 LP\n\nMusic on Vinyl\n\n2012 LP\n\nRCA / Sony Legacy\n\n2012 CD & DVD\n\nSony Legacy\n\n2012 CD\n\nRCA\n\n2012\n\nFor futher Informationen on each release, please click the Title of the specific release.\n\nSpecial Thanks to allmusic.com"
