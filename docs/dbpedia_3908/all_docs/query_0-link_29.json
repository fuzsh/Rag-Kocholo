        "text": "A group of records in a message created in accordance with a flat-file standard that communicates data that belongs intrinsically together. All records in a Block carry the same block identifier and all records with the same record identifier belong to the same Block. The identifier of a Block shall be unique within a message. All records of a Block are contiguously provided within a message. In the DSR standard Blocks comprise the description of a “head” release or resource, its constituent resource(s), any releases that were created by the sender of the messager based on the head release (including single-track releases), plus any associated sales and usage records. A Block collates all records within a report that describe all sales and usage of the “head” release and its constituent parts or “head” resource (notwithstanding summary records and information contained in the header record, HEAD).\n\nA Right Share as calculated for the collection of money for Right Shares. It specifies the ratio (percentage) of a composition that a Rights Holder is contractually entitled to collect from a Licensee, by rights type, territory, and period. In the context of the Letters of the Direction Choreography Standard, Collection Shares are the Right Shares that are being transferred from a Relinquishing Publisher to an Acquiring Publisher.\n\nA Party (that is usually owned or controlled by its members and/or organised on a not-for-profit basis) that, as its sole or main purpose, administers copyright or related rights on behalf of at least two Rights Controllers, for the collective benefit of those Rights Controllers where it is authorised by law or by way of assignment or Licence. A Collective Management Organisation may also be a Licensor, a Rights Administrator, a Licensing Agent or a Rights Holder. A Collective Management Organisation may or may not be the Message Sender or Message Recipient of a message in a specific information exchange defined by a DDEX Standard.\n\nAn entity in a DDEX Message that has the technical cardinality of 0-1 or 0-n, but that is mandatory when a DDEX message is sent in a specific commercial context. In such circumstances, a message is deemed conformant only if and when it contains all the “contractually mandatory” fields as agreed by Message Sender and Message Recipient.\n\nA service that acts as a broker for information exchange, typically using DDEX Messages. In the context of the Musical Works Notification, Musical Works Licensing and Letter of Direction Standards defined by DDEX, a Hub acts as an intermediary for information exchange to facilitate sharing of Right Share information. Hubs may also play a role in facilitating licensing processes between (prospective) Licensors and (prospective) Licensees. Hubs may also act as routers and/or provide data caching functionality.\n\nA Party that is granted a Licence in respect of rights in one or more Creations, by a Licensor. The Licensee may be a human being or other legal person or corporate entity. The Licensee may or may not be the Message Sender or Message Recipient of a message in a specific information exchange defined by a DDEX Standard.\n\nA Party that grants a Licence in respect of rights in one or more Creations to one or more Licensees in accordance with the authorities it has been granted to do so by one or more Rights Controller(s), Rights Administrator(s) (where applicable), Licensing Agent(s) (where applicable) or Rights Holder(s). The Licensor may be a human being or other legal person or corporate entity. The Licensor may or may not also be the Rights Controller, the Rights Administrator, the Licensing Agent or the Rights Holder in the Creation(s) that are the subject of the Licence granting the rights. The Licensor may or may not be the Message Sender or Message Recipient of a message in a specific information exchange defined by a DDEX Standard.\n\nA Work intended to be perceivable as a combination of sounds, with or without accompanying text. Any words that are intended to be expressed with a Musical Work (often termed Lyrics) form part of that Musical Work; not all Musical Works have Lyrics. A Musical Work may be expressed and fixed to become part of a Sound Recording or a Video Recording, or may be used to create notated music (sheet music, scores, instrumental parts) or sound generation codes (such as MIDI files). In some cases, the Musical Work comes into existence simultaneously with its expression. This is common in extemporised forms such as jazz music.\n\nThe proportion of the overall Musical Work that a writer has assigned to an Original Publisher. Note that each Writer can have zero, one or many Original Publishers, and hence zero, one or many Original Publisher Shares. As opposed to collection shares, an Original Publisher Share does not define a share for the collection of money.\n\nA Manifestation of a Release (or another Resource) which is made available to Consumers, by sale, loan or other means. The attributes of a Release in its digital manifestation as a Product may be technical (e.g., the codec or bit rate); a mode of distribution (e.g., downloading or streaming); or a commercial term (e.g., price).\n\nA Release is an abstract entity representing a bundle of one or more Resources compiled by an Issuer. The Resources in Releases are normally primarily Sound Recordings or music audio-visual recordings, but this is not invariably the case. The Release is not itself the item of trade (or “Product”). Products have more extensive attributes than Releases; one Release may be disseminated in many different Products.\n\nA Party that owns and/or controls and/or administers rights in one or more Creations in respect of some or all rights for specific territories, time periods, Rights Types, Usage Types and Commercial Model Types (which may be anything up to and including all rights for the world, in perpetuity, for all types of Usages and for all types of Commercial Models). Creations include Musical Works, Sound Recordings and other Resources as well as Releases.\n\nThe Rights Controller may be a human being or other legal person or corporate entity.\n\nThe Rights Controller may also be a Rights Holder, an Original Owner, a Rights Administrator or a Licensor.\n\nA Resource that is not a main Resource of a Release. It supports the Primary Resources (examples are lyrics, cover art etc). A change in a Primary Resource typically requires a new Release Identifier, whereas change in a Secondary Resource does not. All Resources that are referenced in a LinkedReleaseResourceReference composite in a NewReleaseMessage are Secondary Resources for that Release.\n\nA Party who directs, and has overall creative and technical oversight of, the entire recording project and the individual recording sessions that are a part of the project. The Producer participates in and/or supervises the recording session and works directly with the Artist, Musicians and Engineers. The Studio Producer makes creative, technical and aesthetic decisions that realize the goals of both the Artist and the Sound Recording Copyright Holder in the creation of musical content. The Studio Producer may perform direct Performances, choose final takes or versions, and oversees the selection of songs, Musicians, singers, Arrangers, studios, etc. The Studio Producer in collaboration with the artist, assigns credits to Performers and technical personnel, and is responsible for supplying accurate crediting information to the record label or media company as official documentation. Other duties of the Studio Producer may include, but are not limited to, overseeing other staffing needs, keeping budgets and schedules, adhering to deadlines, supervising mastering and overall quality control. Note: A Studio Producer is a person and thus may contrast with the role of an Initial Producer.\n\nA Release that is being created from one or more of the primary Resources of a Head Release, typically by the Message Sender. These Sub-Releases are being created by the Message Sender who is making Releases, and tracks from such Releases, available to consumers. These “unbundled tracks”, that is, all the tracks from a Release each made available separately, are the simplest form of Sub-Releases."
