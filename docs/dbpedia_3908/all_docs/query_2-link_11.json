Courtney clearly explained the process and advised me to select Alice to perform. The preview was done within the agreed-upon timeframe, and Alice's singing was simply divine. Then I asked for a few minor changes, and they quickly produced a new version that was exactly what was needed. Thank you Alice for the beautiful singing. Thank you Courtney for the excellent overall experience. Small\n\nHello,\n\nI have build over time more than 10 songs under the artistic name The Good Lambs with the help of StudioPros.

All recordings are very professional and we learn in the process. I simply love music and cannot stop in part given all good experiences I had with StudioPros. Had I started somewhere else, could have been a lot different. Now I know what is good service. Hard to try something else. Small\n\nI like to write lyrics and I don’t know about the music industry.

I am currently working on my second song with StudioPros, and it has been such an amazing experience both times. These studio musicians are serious professionals, it’s obvious by what they produce. I use StudioPros mainly because I want to add live instruments to my songs - and every single time I feel like they can hear what I am hearing in my head. Drums, guitars, strings, all of it. It’s always what I am imagining. They have always been on the same page as me throughout the process, it seems. Thank you StudioPros for making my songs literally come to life!
