        "text": "Good morning Radicals! Here’s what’s up in music news today:\n\nIn This Moment posted a message to fans on social media this Monday, hinting the band was set to record their seventh studio album. In the message, they revealed they were on their way to The Hideout Recording Studio in Las Vegas, NV, where Kevin Churko (producer who has worked with artists such as Five Finger Death Punch and Disturbed), will likely work with them.\n\nThe message was quickly met with enthusiasm from fans, who commented on the short video posted by In This Moment.\n\nGuitarist Joel Stroetzel of Killswitch Engage left the band’s tour in Europe due to a family emergency. The band took to Instagram to share the news in a post, and revealed that the band’s production/stage manager will be filling in for him.\n\nIn the post, which is no longer available, the band stated, “Due to a family emergency Joel had to leave the tour and head home. The next two shows our production/stage manager legend @the_josh will be filling in for a few songs.”\n\nEarlier in December, the band revealed that they have completed their recording of the eighth studio album, which follows their 2016 work Incarnate. Upon returning to North America, Killswitch Engage will be on a co-headlining trek with Parkway Drive beginning in April, in the “Collapse of the World” 2019 tour.\n\nMotley Crue‘s highly anticipated biopic, titled The Dirt, just released an official Teaser and revealed its release date. The upcoming Netflix flick stars rapper Machine Gun Kelly as the band’s drummer Tommy Lee, and he will also join in to record a track for the film.\n\nOther stars in the upcoming film include Iwan Rheon from Game of Thrones, Daniel Webber from The Punisher, and Douglas Booth. Motley Crue shared the sneak peek at the film with the message, “Based on a Crue story #TheDirt.”\n\nThe full trailer is supposed to be released today, and the film will be available on Netflix on March 22. The track that Machine Gun Kelly recorded with the band will be released February 21st.\n\nThe band’s 2001 memoir, which shares the title The Dirt, was the inspiration for the film. Machine Gun Kelly opened up in an interview with Billboard last month about his role in the film and also about reading the memoir. In the interview, he stated that The Dirt was his “Bible”, although he may have had the “wrong idols” growing up.\n\nHe also revealed, “When you’re 13, you don’t really understand problems too much, so you’re just looking at all things that glitter. It wasn’t until we were on set and doing these scenes that we were like, ‘Whoa, this is dark. What are people going to think about this?’” The rapper continued, “But there’s something about the truth in that book – the fact that you do fall in love with these people [who] then do this giant nose dive into this dark place.”\n\nMachine Gun Kelly gave even more insight, and explained his belief that the upcoming film has a deeper meaning than it may appear, saying that it is “just a more intensified version of what all of our lives really are: making mistakes and growing from them. No one gets it right.”"
