        "text": "What Makes This Build Guide Very Different From the Others Online?\n\nMaybe you’ve read a guide on how to make a home recording studio before. There are many of them online. However, I’ve never seen one written by a professional recording studio owner like myself. Usually just some marketing dude is rewording information to make money of Amazon affiliate links but they often don’t know what they’re talking about.\n\nI’m going to give you a real practical guide on how to make a killer home studio without skipping crucial steps.\n\nI should know, since I built, soundproofed, designed & furnished the professional recording studio, Current Sound here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. I also built the first Current Sound location in Adelaide, Australia. I’ve been working as full-time music producer, recording, mixing & mastering engineer in the studios that I have built since 2003.\n\nThis is way more than your typical home studio gear list\n\nAside from a typical gear list of essential items I’ll also be covering, acoustics, design, soundproofing, different types of home studios and their uses so you can work out what’s best for you.\n\nBy the end of this guide you should learn enough to be able to make your own dream home studio without buying stuff you don’t need.\n\nIf you find this useful, please share it on social media so others can find and read it.\n\nThis is an insanely detailed guide\n\nBookmark it, share it, it’s crazy long and detailed. You won’t be able to remember it all.\n\nIt’s more like a free eBook than an article. It’s over 180 pages long and around 40k words. That’s the length of a novel!\n\nI was going to make it into an eBook but I decided to put up for free.\n\nDid I mention it’s long? When I say it’s long, I mean super long, bigger than my …. it’s just really long man. Feel free to skip parts that you’re too lazy to do.\n\nThis is the most in depth home recording studio guide on the internet period. It will help make your home studio more awesome.\n\nThis will literally save you countless hours of reading forums, watching YouTube videos and asking those in the industry questions. Everything you need to know to start a home recording studio is all here in the one place.\n\nWhy Am I Doing This?\n\nAt the time of this article Los Angeles is in lockdown due to Covid-19. My professional recording studio, Current Sound, in Hollywood was forced to close and stop in person recording due to Covid-19. Many of my clients want to setup a home studio and send their songs to me to be mixed but don’t know how to do it.\n\nRather than just making a guide for my clients, I decided to make the most in depth home studio setup guide available on the internet.\n\nThis means you’re getting a rare, true, home recording studio build guide, better than almost every other one out there. I’m going to go far beyond just a gear list.\n\nA No Bias Article\n\nThere are no affiliate links in this article and no one is paying me to write any of this or review any products so there are no biases.\n\nThe best pro audio products aren’t always available on Amazon and often have no affiliate links. The top brands in the pro audio world are Neve, API, SSL, Trident, Daking. The top products are those from those brands as well as many small boutique companies.\n\nMost of those products, aren’t on Amazon, so the person writing the guide will usually not include them, making most, if not all other home recording studio guides you read online suck. I couldn’t find a good one myself so I wrote this one.\n\nThe best way you can find out about these products is by asking actual sound engineers, reading this guide which is written by a professional engineer such as myself and/or checking out the free and loosely moderated sound engineering forums like KVR, Sound on Sound, Gearslutz and the Audio Engineering forum on Reddit.\n\nIf something sucks, I’ll tell you. If something is good, I’ll tell you that too. That’s something you rarely get from a salesperson in a music store who gets paid on commission. To them, whatever you can afford within your budget is good even if it sucks.\n\nThe only thing in it for me is, if you find the guide useful, do me a small favor and share this article on your social media or website so that my recording studio can get a little extra exposure.\n\nAre you ready for the best How to Build a Home Recording Studio guide on the internet? Here we go…\n\nYou can automatically scroll to a chapter by clicking the section below.\n\nWhat Makes a Home Studio Different From a Professional Recording Studio?\n\nThe needs of the person creating the home recording studio with vary from artist to artist. For this reason, there is so much mis-information online about what type of home recording setup you need. The reality is, the type of studio you need is going to vary drastically depending on your expectations and budget.\n\nBefore running out and buying gear to setup a home recording studio, it’s important to work out your needs and expectations first.\n\nHome Recording Studio Vs Professional Recording Studio\n\nProfessional Recording Studios\n\nProfessional recording studios are no compromise studios. Often superior acoustics and soundproofing and contain a variety of equipment suitable for recording different voices and styles. Clients are paying and expect to be able to get a radio ready product. For this reason they also employ in house sound engineers to record and mix the artists.\n\nHere is one of the rooms I designed at my professional studio in Hollywood\n\nHome Recording Studios\n\nHome recording studios are usually just used by one artist and often only contain the equipment needed to record that one artist. That person, the artist, almost always lacks the skills of a good mix engineer. As a result, buying better gear doesn’t always equal a better outcome.\n\nThey’re not trained in acoustics. They’re not trained in mixing. Chances of them ever making a radio ready song completely by themselves without training is zero percent. Mixing takes a long time to learn. Most mix engineers in successful professional recording studios have been mixing full-time for over 10 years.\n\nGood Vs Bad Home Recording Studio Design\n\nSome artists have cooler home studios and the home studios by sound engineers are often way better.\n\nPutting some thought into your home studio like the example above will give you a much nicer space to work from.\n\nAvoiding Common Mistakes\n\nIn general, musicians are terrible at designing home recording studios. They often buy too much stuff that they don’t need and forget about the elements that are important such as soundproofing & acoustics.\n\nMistake #5 – Bad Layout\n\nHaving a think about putting what you need close to where you’ll be sitting. Since most with a home studio tend to buy one of two pieces of gear one at a time as they save up money, they run out of room to put things.\n\nFollow this guide and try to plan ahead and you can avoid this mistake.\n\nMistake #4 – Bad Lighting & Vibe\n\nYou want to feel creative when you go into the studio. The vibe of your space is an important part of that.\n\n3rd Mistake – Messy Home Studios\n\nOne of the major advantages of having a home studio studio is being able to put your ideas down quickly when you have them.\n\nThat is, if you can find your stuff lol.\n\nYou don’t want to be moving items around all the time whenever you have an idea for a song.\n\n2nd Mistake – Too Much Gear\n\nThis guy who has so much stuff he can’t get to his chair.\n\nI can also see a microphone in the corner with no acoustic treatment.\n\nAll of the speakers are in the wrong position for mixing. Everything is hard to reach.\n\n#1 Most Common Mistake – Forgetting About Acoustics and Soundproofing\n\nThis one is a little harder to spot the problem. Overall, he did a decent job on the layout and lighting. It has a great vibe and has a lot of really expensive gear but there is no acoustic treatment or soundproofing. Given that he has an expensive SSL Mixer and all the tools needed to mix, the acoustics and soundproofing are a problem for both mixing and recording.\n\nWhat’s Wrong with This Home Studio Setup?\n\nYou probably can’t tell yet but this setup actually has a lot of issues. Keep reading and you’ll learn why.\n\nThe biggest issue In this article, I’m also going to be giving some advice on studio design as well as acoustics so that you don’t end up making these common mistakes.\n\nHaving Realistic Expectations\n\nIt’s important to be realistic about the purpose of your home recording studio. Learning to mix to the same standard as professional mix engineers is unlikely for most artists. Unless you’re recording and mixing 8 hours a day for many years, you’ll most likely suck. The reality is, most people use their home studios for demos and for songwriting. That’s why there are thousands of professional recording studios still around.\n\nThe professional recording studios these days act like talent agency for mix engineers. The studios care about their brand. You book the studio and just think, “They will have someone there to operate and gear.” What is the actual case is, “They have someone there to operate the gear AND mix your song.” The gear alone, doesn’t make the recording sound great. It’s a combination of the gear, the acoustics and the most important ingredient, the skill-set of the mix engineer.\n\nThe truth is though, that same mix engineer, probably has a killer home studio where he could record and mix to a similar standard. The only problem is, he’ll probably get fired from the professional studio pretty quickly if he started pulling their clients over to his home studio lol.\n\nWhat sort of sound can you realistically get?\n\nIn terms of yourself as an artist, you can buy all the gear in the world and still make a recording that sounds like trash. The gear is only a small piece of the puzzle.\n\nThink of it like buying a 1960s Les Paul guitar without taking guitar lessons. Sure it’s an amazing and expensive guitar but the guitar itself will sound terrible in the hands of someone who doesn’t have the skill to play it.\n\nRecording gear is not that much different. You need more than the gear alone, skill is the one thing you can’t buy from a music store.\n\nThe reality is, most artists, even after years of practice, never get to the skill level required to make anything beyond demo quality. Professional engineers have usually spent 5-10 years or more of recording and mixing each day, 8 hours or more a day before they actually get good enough to make a living doing it. The chances of you getting to the same level by only mixing for a couple of hours a week is pretty slim.\n\nHome studios can save you lots of money in terms of coming up with ideas and composition but to think you will be able to mix a song that will make it on the radio or get signed to a label is not realistic for most.\n\nI personally think most artists should have a home studio but just be realistic with your expecations.\n\nMaking a Better Than Average Home Studio\n\nMost home studios also aren’t good enough to be able to record at home and send of for mixing.\n\nWe’ll be talking about that because if you follow my guide, buy the more expensive items and follow the acoustic and sound isolation tips, you should be able to record vocals at home to a reasonable enough standard for mixing in a professional studio, if that’s something you’re interested in doing.\n\nMost home studios also aren’t good enough for learning to mix in or bring a freelance engineer in to mix in.\n\nIf you want to pursue sound engineering as a career (pretty tough career to get into by the way), you’re going to want to build a better home studio that’s suitable for mixing. I’ll be covering this also.\n\nIf you want to bring a freelance engineer into your home studio, you’re also going to have to have a better home recording studio that’s more suited for mixing.\n\nTypes of Home Studios\n\nThe type of home recording studio you make will depend on what you’re going to use it for. You can spend your budget in certain areas suited for your needs and expectations.\n\nDemo Cutting Home Studio\n\nThis the most typical type of home studio. It’s the one on almost every home recording studio build guide. You can pretty much buy the cheapest gear for this, it doesn’t matter. The problem is, most people make this type of home studio with the wrong expectations.\n\nInfluencers, playlist curators, radio stations, DJs, potential fans and people needed to help market your song won’t help you. Most artists put their music up on social media and think it’s good enough. Just because you think it sounds fine or good, doesn’t mean those important in the music industry will. In fact, labels don’t sign artists of demos anymore.\n\nThis type of home studio is best for just cutting demos to work out which songs to re-record and have mixed in a professional recording studio if you want to release them.\n\nIt’s not the type of setup you should have if you want to record at home and send your recordings to a professional mix engineer like myself for mixing.\n\nAverage Quality Rating\n\nAcoustics: 1/5, Minimal to no treatment\n\nSoundproofing: 0/5, Typically no soundproofing\n\nRecording gear: 1/5, Cheapest\n\nStudio Monitors: 1/5, Cheapest\n\nOutput quality: Demo\n\nSuitable For\n\nSongwriting and cutting demos to save time on professional recording later\n\nMaking recordings for yourself or your friends\n\nArtists who aren’t professional sound engineers (most artists)\n\nArtists who aren’t going to share their music online and on social media\n\nNot Suitable For\n\nReplacing tracking in a commercial recording studio\n\nSending songs to a mixing and/or mastering engineer\n\nCreating songs for sale and release\n\nBeat-Maker Home Studio\n\nIf you’re making beats/instrumentals to sell to artists online, you’ll have more music creation tools and less recording and mixing gear.\n\nIn the photo above, the speakers are too far apart and are resting directly on the desk, indicating the person doesn’t know about acoustics and mixing.\n\nIn this photo, the speakers are too far apart and there is no acoustic treatment so this is also just for beat-making.\n\nHowever, learning to mix and buying professional recording gear, opens up new doors and could help you transition into a music producer where you’re recording, producing for artists and working directly with the artists in person. Or if you want to go the DJ/Producer route, being able to mix a song to test out in the club is a huge plus.\n\nAverage Quality Rating\n\nAcoustics: 1/5, Often none or a little acoustic treatment\n\nSoundproofing: 0/5, Typically no soundproofing\n\nRecording gear: 0/5, Often none\n\nStudio Monitors: 3/5, Ideally better than average studio monitors but not always\n\nOutput quality: Unmixed Instrumentals/Beats\n\nSuitable For\n\nSelling beats online\n\nSending electronic music production\n\nNot Suitable For\n\nRecording and mixing artists\n\nMixing, unless you add acoustic treatment and better monitors\n\nRecording & Mix Engineer Home Studio\n\nThese are often much closer to same as a professional recording and are usually built by sound engineers who have professional mixing skills.\n\nAverage Quality Rating\n\nAcoustics: 4/5 to 5/5, Decent to Best Acoustics\n\nSoundproofing: 2/5 is average for a beginner but professionals range from 3/5 to 5/5.\n\nRecording gear: 4/5, High quality gear suitable for different situations and artists\n\nStudio Monitors: 5/5, Best studio monitors\n\nOutput quality: Radio Ready, if the engineer has the skills and experience\n\nSuitable For\n\nProfessional recording engineers or those aspiring to be a professional recording engineer\n\nCons\n\nHigher cost than the average home studio puts it out of the reach of most independent artists and in most cases is overkill for a single artist unless they are bringing in an outside mix engineer to work with them in person.\n\nTracking Home Studio\n\nIn this setup, acoustics for tracking (recording) is prioritized over mixing. In this photo you can see a couple of live rooms but and nice vibes but minimal gear, just what is needed for tracking. Even the acoustics for mixing aren’t the best in this photo given the lack of acoustic panels and the fact that there is an extra booth of to the side in the first reflection point where an acoustic panel would have to be for an accurate listening/mixing environment. However, this would be a good setup for recording a band and sending the parts out to a mix engineer like myself to be mixed online and/or to a music producer to be remixed.\n\nAverage Quality Rating\n\nAcoustics: 4/5, Decent Acoustics\n\nSoundproofing: 3/5 to 5/5, Above average/medium level soundproofing to high soundproofing\n\nRecording gear: 3/5, Usually one decent vocal recording chain suited for themselves\n\nStudio Monitors: 3/5, Usually better studio monitors to hear what’s being tracked better\n\nOutput quality: Ready to Send off to mixing\n\nSuitable For\n\nProfessional Artists\n\nArtists in remote areas that want to have their music mixed online\n\nMost artists in the world that are in coronavirus lockdown and want to have their music mixed online but have a higher than average budget\n\nNot Suitable For\n\nMixing unless the acoustics and monitors are upgraded. This will mean acoustic panels would have to be placed at the reflection points such as where the glass window is in the photo above.\n\nPros\n\nYou can record at home anytime without having to go into a professional recording studio at a similar audio quality\n\nCons\n\nHigher cost than the average home studio an unless you’re recording a lot, can end up costing more than simply booking a professional recording studio when needed.\n\nYou miss out on the direction of a music producer or sound engineer as opposed to going to a music producer operated recording studio which can lead to a worse performance.\n\nYou can’t bring a professional engineer into your home studio to mix.\n\nRich Person Who Doesn’t Know What They’re Doing Home Studio – lol\n\nYes, the photo is back. This is so common though that it has it’s own category. Here is LA, I see lots of home studio where the money is spent in all the wrong places. This is about a 150k setup. Yet the acoustics and incorrect speaker placement makes it an inaccurate listening enviroment that could easily be fixed by moving a few things around and a couple hundred dollars worth of acoustic treatment.\n\nMost artists don’t need a setup like this because most artists don’t know how to mix and don’t want to spend years learning how to mix.\n\nHowever, wouldn’t you be pissed off if you paid $150,000 for a home studio setup only to find it wasn’t accurate for mixing?\n\nI’ve been hired by artists to come to their super expensive home studios to mix their music only to find similar problems like you see in this photo.\n\nRight now, the positioning of the items and lack of acoustic treatment is creating a massive bottleneck for the equipment. For under 10k, you could come close to maxing out each category in the list other than soundproofing. Right now this 150k setup looks like this;\n\nQuality Rating of The Pictured Setup\n\nAcoustics: 0/5, No Acoustics\n\nSoundproofing: 0/5 for the room 4/5 for the booth\n\nRecording gear: 5/5 for now, 30k of mics… being destroyed by incorrect storage lol, more on this later. 77k SSL mixer. 20k ProTools HDX setup.\n\nStudio Monitors: 5/5 10k monitors but due to their positioning, 3/5 accuracy. Large bass build up on the left side only will make it hard to mix on these.\n\nOutput quality: Shit. Still can’t do an accurate mix.\n\nSo let’s learn how to spend money where it matters and do things right.\n\nHow to Make a Better Home Recording Studio\n\nAs a musician, singer or rapper, it’s pretty tempting to just fill a room with lots of your favorite instruments. After all, you need a practice space. People often confuse a home studio with their bedroom or other rooms in the house. Collecting one thing at a time and finding a place for it.\n\nThink About Where You’re Going to Put Stuff Before You Buy It\n\nThe reason professional studios look to great is that the gear was usually purchased in advance, all at once and the design was thought out.\n\nWhen professional studios start to look bad\n\nHow many old recording studios have you seen with computers, mice, keyboard and screens all in awkward places?\n\nYou can end up with the same issue in your home studio.\n\nA lot of professional studios, once built, struggle to integrate new technology and find a place for new items.\n\nPeople that have a home studio, often buy gear without thinking about where it will go. Purchasing one piece at a time without thinking if there will be room for it or if the gear will be within reach.\n\nLet me make a suggestion…\n\nDon’t start a home recording studio by purchasing gear.\n\nInstead, create a gear list of everything you think you will need, where it will go and only purchase items off your list. Not only will that help you save money and not by un-nesscessary items but it will keep your studio looking organized. It sounds easier than it is but it will stop your studio from looking like a bunch of junk in a room and help the ergonomics of your home studio.\n\nHow you can make a killer home studio\n\nNow that you know the types of home recording studios, I’m going to suggest an in between home studio setup. This will focus on making a setup that will allow yourself to grow.\n\nThat way, you might be able to send your vocals off to a mix engineer or producer like myself for a mix or remix.\n\nOr you might be able to learn to mix to see if you want to pursue it as a career. Or maybe you just want a place to make all your musician friends jealous.\n\nYou can of course skip some parts but then you’ll end up with a demo cutting home studio. If that’s all you want/need, that’s ok but you don’t really need a guide for that since you can just buy the cheapest stuff.\n\nHere is my professional recording studio that I designed in Hollywood, Current Sound. There is no reason you can’t make something similar at home.\n\nIt is completely soundproof and acoustically treated.\n\nI like it because it has everything I need without having to move, moves up and down from sitting to standing height and I can set the ideal height for either playing or mixing.\n\nI use 500 series rack preamps and compressors so keep everything nice and compact.\n\nSo let me help you make a killer home studio…\n\nSoundproofing\n\nLooking at my lists above and photos I’ve found online of home studios, you’ll see the number 1 think forgotten in almost all home studios in soundproofing. If you don’t want disturbances like traffic noise coming in or to annoy your neighbors, you should at least do some minimal soundproofing. It won’t be as good as the isolation at Current Sound which uses the very expensive room in a room technique but it will still be reasonable. I’ve done this to many houses and apartments in the past.\n\nIt’s best to do this before you even more all of your gear into the room. Sometimes you can to do it later by moving everything aside and covering it all with plastic sheeting. I’d recommend doing this first, even before buying any gear.\n\nShould You Soundproof Your Apartment a Little?\n\nMost home recording studios aren’t soundproofed, not even a tiny bit. Most artists don’t want to be bothered soundproofing their apartment or house. At this point, you’re probably thinking…\n\nShould I be bothered with soundproofing?\n\nStudio condenser mics are super sensitive. They will pick up not just your voice but your breath, your clothes moving all of the sound around you including outside your apartment. Other people talking, birds chirping, cars passing by, footsteps, buses, police sirens, gun shots and all the wonderful sounds of your neighborhood.\n\nMaybe if you’re an awesome freestyle rapper, you could even make some of those sounds fit in the song but a dog barking or your mother telling you to clean your room, move out of home and get a real job could be hard to fit into your next single.\n\nThis is where working out the type of home studio you’re going to be making comes in.\n\nAre you just making a place to compose ideas and demos?\n\nIf so, maybe a passing car in your recording is not such a big of a deal.\n\nAre you just making a beat-making studio?\n\nMaybe you have no mics to record you’re just making beats? Having outside sound coming in might not be such a big deal.\n\nAre you making a tracking studio to send off for a proper mix and master?\n\nNow soundproofing is a massive issue. You don’t want a passing car, bus, dog barking or whatever to ruin your perfect take and you definitely probably don’t want a car horn or USPS truck in your next single.\n\nWill making a lot of noise piss off people around you and/or get you evicted?\n\nThis is the part most musicians don’t think about until it’s too late and causes problems. Don’t forget about sound coming out of your studio\n\nSoundproofing isn’t just about sound coming into your studio. It’s also about stopping sound from coming out.\n\nIf you have inspiration at 3am to record a song are you going to get evicted from your apartment?\n\nRealistically, how much noise can you really make until it starts to cause you problems?\n\nMost musicians in the US move to big cities like LA and NY. Unfortunately, most apartments are made out of drywall and have windows that are close to your neighbors windows, letting all the sounds escape your studio.\n\nProper soundproofing is great but super expensive\n\nTo completely soundproof an house or an apartment is very expensive and requires either owing the property or having the landlord’s permission as well as deep pockets.\n\nFor each room, it involves building a whole extra layer studs, insulation and drywall inside of your existing room, known as the room in a room technique. You basically construct a whole extra room inside of the room. Something like that can easily set you back around 10k for a small room or typical bedroom.\n\nLet’s look into an in between solution…\n\nDon’t freak out when you hear about soundproofing. Partial/semi-soundproofing is still very beneficial and if you’re willing to do it yourself, might only costs a few hundred dollars or so.\n\nAll of these can easily be removed when you move out of your apartment and don’t cost a whole lot to do.\n\nIf you just attack the weak points of the room such as the windows and door(s) you can reduce the amount of sound coming in and out by around half or sometimes even more and that’s based on drywall.\n\nThat might be enough to make your loud studio sound like a medium level TV to your neighbor rather than a nightclub.\n\nMost likely you’ll still have issues with bass and subs but it will make your neighbors like you a hell of a lot more and could be the difference between staying in your apartment or getting kicked out.\n\nSo I’m going to help you semi-soundproof your apartment or studio room so you can be creative without pissing off everyone around you.\n\nHow to Semi-Soundproof an Apartment Temporarily\n\nWhy semi-soundproof you ask?\n\nMost musicians in the US rent. That makes soundproofing very difficult. As mentioned earlier, the best way to soundproof a room is to build a whole new room inside another room, known as The Room in a Room Technique. This is often not possible if you’re renting and costs on average around 10k per small room if you’re paying construction workers. So lets look at an in-between type of setup suitable for most musicians that you can do without causing any permanent damage to the apartment.\n\nFor handymen that own their properties or if you have the cash and the landlord’s permission and want to do the room in the room setup, you can checkout the Gearslutz forum on studio building.\n\nWeak Points\n\nMost apartment walls are made from studs, drywall and insulation. Those are all fairly dense, nowhere near as good as brick though but fairly dense. They do a fairly reasonable job of keeping sound out.\n\nWhat isn’t dense and thick is glass. Windows are the weakest points of any room in terms of soundproofing, followed by the door.\n\nSure you can get double pane windows but even they’re going to be weaker than the actual wall. What isn’t weaker than the wall is, well, more wall!\n\nSo we’re going to turn the windows into wall!\n\nIf you do this right, it will be removable and just as dense, if not more dense, than the actual wall.\n\nFrom the Windows, to the Wall.\n\nOk Skeet Skeet Mother fu*kers, here’s how you go from a window to a wall.\n\nWe’re going to make a window plug.\n\nThe best way I have found to do this in a temporary way is to stuff them with dense sound absorption material. Roxul Rockboard 60 or Roxul Rockboard 80 is a good option. I’d recommend the 80 for this if you can get it. Roxul Rockboard 80 will absorb more bass than Rockboard 60 and is also more rigid.\n\nYou can probably find it locally at insulation suppliers but you can also order from ATS Acoustics. They didn’t pay me to say that so I don’t care where you get it from.\n\nOwens Corning 703 is a little better at absorbing very low subs but more dangerous to work. It requires all cutting to be done outside. It isn’t recommended for any furnished apartment. With OC703, you have to wear an N95 mask (sold out in the US at the moment), glasses and cover all skin and wash down the floor and walls after use.\n\nOC703 contains formaldehyde which is known as a cause of cancer and fiberglass is a known irritant so it takes some balls to work with and needs to always remain covered whenever you’re not wearing an N95 mask around it plus you have to cover all of your skin when working with it.\n\nThat makes Roxul the safer choice of the two.\n\nMaking a Window Plug\n\nThis needs to be a super tight fit to work. If it is airtight, it is helping to soundproof. Like if someone is listening to headphones. If the headphones are off their head, all the sound comes out. So follow all the steps\n\nWhat You Need\n\nRigid soundproofing insulation (Roxul Rockboard 60 or 80 or OC 703)\n\nStanley Knife\n\nPlastic drop sheets to stop insulation fibers and glue from getting on the floor and on furniture. Cover everything.\n\nCloths\n\nBucket of water\n\nRubber gloves\n\nMask (ideally N95 if you can find one, otherwise any mask)\n\nSpray glue. Gorilla glue is good.\n\nThe longest ruler you can find at the hardware store. Ideally it should be at least 48″ long.\n\nMeasuring tape\n\nA large piece of wood, larger than the insulation, 3ft by 4ft minmum such as a sheet of MDF to use as a cutting board. The MDF must be a foot larger than the width and length of your largest window.\n\nFabric. If you use acoustic fabric such as ‘speaker grill fabric’, burlap or any other breathable fabric, these panels will double up as acoustic panels. For just soundproofing, you can use any fabric since the sound has to come in through the glass window first. To test if it’s breathable, place your hand behind the fabric and blow through it. If you can feel your breath, it’s breathable and will work.\n\nLong sleeve shirt, pants and if using OC703, shoes that you don’t care about wearing anymore. You will need to wash your clothes after before wearing them again. I usually just go to the salvation army or Ross and buy the cheapest possible clothes and then throw them out after. Insulation is itchy.\n\nPossibly a Phillips head screw driver (optional)\n\nMarker\n\nSafety glasses\n\nSteps to Make a Window Plug\n\nMeasuring the Window\n\nUse the tape measure to measure the window and measure each edge, left, right, top, bottom. Write it down. Don’t assume it is level. Don’t assume it is even. Most old apartments have moved and the windows aren’t even.\n\nCutting the Insulation to Size\n\nThe next part is best done outside if possible, otherwise, cover everything in the room with plastic sheets\n\nWear long sleeves, mask and safety glasses\n\nPlace the MDF sheet on the floor, this will be our cutting board.\n\nUse the ruler and marker to mark it the sheet of insulation. If the window is larger than the insulation sheet (24×48), you will have to cut two sheets and use spray glue on the edges to glue them together. Note, it’s easier if you cut each sheet to size separately first before gluing them.\n\nPlace the ruler along each line you want to cut. Use the Stanley knife and place it hard up against the ruler. Attempt to cut it to the exact size. Make sure to keep the blade straight. If the blade is not on a perfect 90 degree angle to the ground, you’ll angle off the insulation.\n\nIf you need to do a larger window than 48×24, cut the extra piece you need of another sheet. Spray spay glue on the edges (open a window if possible, you need ventilation) and quickly press and hold them together for a couple of minutes. Cut a thin strip of fabric over the length of the join and spray it on the front and back, this will help create a stronger bond.\n\nOnce you’ve made your perfect size panel lets see if you messed it up lol. Put it in the window frame and press it in. If you did it right, gravity should hold it in. If you messed it up it either wont fit in or it won’t stay in. In that case, if it need trimming, try to trim it a little. Otherwise you can either glue an off-cut back onto it or just throw it out and try again and use that piece for off-cuts for the other windows.\n\nAt this point you’ve probably realized the window latches and handle hit the panel. You can either unscrew them or you can measure where they are and mark them on the insulation. If marking them, also measure how far out they stick. You need to make that size hole in the insulation without going through to the other side.\n\nOnce you’ve made your holes, place it back to make sure it fits snug.\n\nAt this point it’s probably stuck and you can’t get it out. You need to get it out for the next step. You can gentle wedge the edge of Stanley knife between the window edge and the insulation and go around the edges and carefully wedge it out.\n\nIf you’re cavity is large and you can fit two sheets in there, do two. It will absorb more bass. One is still a big improvement over none.\n\nMaking the Insulation Safer\n\nWhatever you do, do not skip this step! Insulation is bad for you. The fibers get into the air, into your lungs and can even cause cancer. That’s why you should be wearing a must through this. You need to wrap them if you’re going to live with them. If you wrap them properly, they’ll be as safe as the acoustic panels in professional recording studios. I see so many un-wrapped or partially wrapped acoustic panels in home recording studios that is super concerning and dangerous. You must wrap them.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to cut more fabric than you need then trim it down. It’s best not to overlap the fabric so that it looks nicer. You’re going to be folding it over the panel so cut double the length of the width or the height of the panel. Also the insulation is 2 inches thick (unless you bought the rare 4″ versions). That means you need to add 4 inches extra 2+2 but I’d say go with 8 inches or more extra because it’s easier to wrap around.\n\nOnce you’ve cut your sheet overlay it over the insulation panel to see where it will go.\n\nShake the spray can for 30 seconds. Pull back a little of the fabric and spray the insulation. Pull the fabric back over, keeping it tight and press it down. Keep doing this all the way until you’ve sprayed the whole side.\n\nFlip the panel over. Spray the edge you’re going to bend around. Do the same for the back.\n\nFor the corners, you want to make a flap that bends around the edges. You can do this with the fabric that is there but I also like to put an extra layer underneath on the corner edges. Make sure you can’t see any insulation or holes in the corners. Otherwise, cut some extra fabric for the corners and stick it on.\n\nImproving the Window Plug if it’s Loose\n\nIf once you’re done, the window plug won’t hold in with gravity, it’s likely too small. You can add some foam weather-stripping around the window plug to make it a tighter fit. The idea behind this is the foam is more squishy than the insulation and will compress down.\n\nWith Landlord Permission – Beef Up the Window Plug\n\nThe insulation window plug alone provides a decent level of soundproofing but if you live in a particularly noisy area, you can consider adding an MDF sheet over the top of the window and then sealing the edge of the MDF by either silicon (permanent) or foam weather stripping (removable).\n\nThis issue with this though is, you have to place screws into the window frame. So it’s not good for renters unless you know how to paint and patch holes. You’ll also need the landlord’s permission.\n\nBest to consult a handyman for this part if you want to do this go the extra mile.\n\nThis will however, truly turn the window into a wall.\n\nTips for this…\n\nIf you’re going to try beefing up the window plug, using L brackets around the frame will often make it easier to remove and patch later.\n\nI’m going to mention one other technique because if I don’t I know some smartass probably will. It just doesn’t work for most windows. They have to be very deep. If you have a really deep window sill, you might even be able to make an entire wooden frame with a wooden back and a little foam little weather stripping or foam on the edges around the insulation that is only held in with pressure. With this style you can even put and handle on it. This only works on very deep windows and quickly becomes problematic on older places with uneven window lengths.\n\nOther resources on Window Plugs\n\nHere is an article on all the different types of window plugs you can make. Personally I prefer my frame-less one I just taught you how to do since most apartments don’t have square/even windows as most apartments are old. The frame-less one is a little more forgiving for not so even windows and also allows you to keep the hardware (latches etc) on the window without removing it. As you can see on this resource, all these windows are very deep. If you do have a very deep window frame, this is better since it will allow you to add the MDF without damaging the window at all: https://bettersoundproofing.com/how-to-diy-soundproof-window-plug/\n\nFAQ: Can’t I Just Cut Acoustic Foam to the Size of the Windows?\n\nAlthough this is better than not doing anything at all, it won’t have much effect on the sound under 500hz which is your low-mid, bass and subs.\n\nBeefing Up the Door\n\nHave a look at your door. See how easy it is to swing and how heavy it feels when you push it. Give it a knock in the middle and on the edge. If it sounds hollow in the middle or in places, you have a hollow core door. That’s bad news. Like the window, sound will go straight in and out of it. Probably best to call a handyman to install a solid core door. You can also glue multiple sheets of insulation together, cut out squares for the latches and door knob and make a whole door panel. It’s a huge amount of work though. You’d then have to glue it to the door (problem if renting) of you can use liquid nails to glue removable 3M velcro picture handing strips to one the panel and stick it onto the door.\n\nIf you own the place you can use green glue and MDF instead and cut that to side and glue it to the door.\n\nIf you’re renting, keep in mind that doors can be removed so you can always make a new door and just put the old door back on when you move out.\n\nSealing the Door\n\nPlace weather stripping around the door to make it air-tight. Air-tight + dense = soundproof. Even that removable foam weather stripping is better than nothing. Place a door sweep on the bottom of the door. You can also buy a heavy duty ‘door drop/door bottom’ that is a mechanism that drops a solid piece of metal down the bottom of the door when you close it. They have plastic door sweeps that are sticky and removable but they sometimes strip the paint. Your landlord probably won’t care if you add a door sweep in most cases. You just improved the door. Your heating and cooling bills will also go down after this also.\n\nVents, AC Units, Heating, Holes.\n\nApartments have an annoying amount of other weak points. Each apartment is different. The solution isn’t always ideal. You can seal cracks off with sealant but often the air conditioner is a problem. The air conditioner unit acts like a small speaker to outside. Well, old wall units do. Modern split systems and ceiling units are less of an issue. You could make an MDF box with a foam seal to go over it but then you’ve got no air-conditioner. They make portable air-conditioner units but you need to run the tube somewhere. Best is into another room that you’re not recording in but if you only have a studio apartment, there isn’t too much you can do about this. Having a portable heater is easy though.\n\nVocal Booth\n\nIf your place is made from drywall like most apartment are in the US, what we did might not be enough for recording vocals. For double brick or concrete all the way around, it’s probably very quiet. Although air vents, heating and air conditioner units still present a weak point in the room.\n\nIf it’s drywall and in a noisy area, you might need a vocal booth for recording vocals still. Most people skip this step because they’re expensive. Depending on how often the interruptions occur and your budget and intended use of the studio will be deciding factors.\n\nVocal booths are great but because the pre-made ones are portable, often you need to do what we did prior to keep the subs and low rumbles out. Don’t expect the booth to solve all the problems, it’s still a good idea to fix the weak points in the room.\n\nWhat I particularly like about vocal booths in home recording studios is that, if you have an apartment, fridges, people and internal noises can still be an issue. In a studio apartment, even if you did everything above, you’re fridge will still be in your recordings lol.\n\nHere is a great example of the effectiveness of a vocal booth in terms of soundproofing.\n\nSound isolation not soundproof\n\nNotice he put the booth in the basement. That’s why I also suggest beefing up the weak points of the room earlier. Many people in the US live in apartments and don’t have the luxury of having a basement. In fact, there are no basements in California where many artists move to due to earthquakes.\n\nVocal booths don’t cut out all noise from outside. That’s why they advertise them as sound isolation booths rather than soundproof booths. There is no such thing as something that is completely soundproof and portable.\n\nHow vocal booths work is by adding mass and being airtight. By increasing the mass between the source you’re recording (for singers and rappers at home, that would be yourself) and the ambient noise (noise still present inside), the level of disturbances is reduced.\n\nJust like I explained earlier with the window plug, the window is the least dense part of the wall in any place. It’s just a thin piece of glass. Making the window plug makes something that is not dense into something that is.\n\nA vocal booth takes that concept a step further and completely surrounds you in dense and airtight material. For that reason, don’t buy any booth that doesn’t have ventilation or you’ll be very hot an uncomfortable.\n\nThe science behind how vocal booths work\n\nIf you really want to know how booths work, they are quite fascinating. The booth itself is not soundproof but once the sound that does escape the booth, the energy bounces between the outside walls of your booth and the inside of your room and which leaves less energy to move across to the next room (or your neighbors if you’re in an apartment).\n\nThis is known as the room inside of a room technique which is how professional recording studios are built. You build a whole new room inside of your room.\n\nThat is the science you see in action in the video above. It works both ways to keep outside noise from coming in as well as noise from the booth going outside the host room. Had the booth been placed outside in the back yard, you’d most likely still hear the\n\nSome vocal booths offer ‘double wall’ or ‘enhanced versions’. Which when done properly, have an airgap between the two walls and make a room inside of a room. When you place that in your home studio, you have a room in a room in another room. The room in a room technique is happening twice! A room in a room in a room.\n\nIf you’re thinking of getting a vocal booth, look at the db reduction specs. For every 10db in reduction, you get around twice the amount of reduction.\n\nFor example, an STC rating of 40db is about twice as much reduction as an STC rating of 30db.\n\nYou can download a Db app on your phone to check the DB level of your apartment. Although not completely accurate, they’re reasonably close. Click Here for iOS and Click Here for Android.\n\nIs it possible to make a DIY vocal booth?\n\nIf you’re a builder it’s certainly possible. After all, most vocal booths in professional recording studios aren’t modular portable booths.\n\nMaking something modular for an apartment is quite a challenge. Modular vocal booths are very exact in terms of being airtight and able to be moved easily. You’d need killer carpentry skills, which lets face it, most artists don’t have. Here is one dude that managed to do it: https://www.voices.com/blog/build-budget-friendly-whisperroom/\n\nWhat about those portable vocal booth reflection filter things?\n\nDon’t confuse these silly things with vocal booths. They’re nothing like a vocal booth despite the marketing from companies trying to cash in on unknowing artists.\n\nDon’t waste money on those portable reflection filters. They suck. They’re almost useless. They’re aimed at people too lazy to put acoustic panels or even foam on the walls.\n\nDon’t be lazy, spend your money on acoustic panels and treat the room. We’ll be talking about acousitc panels later.\n\nReflections and reverb is different to sound isolation. They don’t offer any sound isolation or soundproofing.\n\nFixing the acoustic issues of a vocal booth\n\nRecording in a small booth can result in a lot of low-mid and bass reflections. You can minimized this problem with acoustic panels. Most people just put foam in them but foam has less absorption under 500hz than acoustic panels. I’d suggest actual acoustic panels with velcro on the back unless your booth is really large to help reduce the bass.\n\nYou won’t find any pre-made acoustic panels for vocal booths but you can either make your own or modify pre-made ones. Vocals booths usually have felt walls, making it easy to Velcro stuff on there without damaging the booth walls.\n\nYou can make frame-less acoustic panels like we made earlier for the window plug, glue some velcro on the back with a very thick glue like Liquid Nails. Or you can make acoustic panels with a wooden back or thick wooden edges and staple the velcro strip to the back with a staple gun. The acoustic panels from ATS Acousitcs have a thick wood strip on the back edges making them perfect for stapling Velcro too.\n\nVocal Booth Companies\n\nPre-made vocal booths are expensive. You pay extra for the ability to be able to break it down into parts and move it from place to place easily. This makes sense for an apartment and home. The top companies that make vocal booths are Whisper Room, VocalBooth.com and LA Vocal Booths. There are a few others but they lack reduction specs and are smaller operations.\n\nYou might be able to find a local carpenter to make you a booth but the ability to break it down for transport will vary. Small vocal booths are more simple for a carpenter to make. The large booths are very complex and have a lot of parts designed to tightly fit together.\n\nA vocal booth works by being completely airtight. So make sure to buy one with a ventilation system or you’ll be sweating in there after 30 minutes.\n\nAcoustics\n\nSound coming into the studio from outside isn’t the only thing that can mess up a recording. So can the reflections of sound bouncing around the walls inside the studio.\n\nBefore you fill the room with gear, fix the acoustics. It’s much harder to do once you start furnishing the room. If you’ve already furnished the room, you’ll be busy moving everything around while you do this and it may mean rewiring the whole studio as a result.\n\nAcoustics and soundproofing is not the same. Soundproof is referred to as isolation and is about stopping sound coming in and out of the studio. Acoustics is about stopping sound bouncing around the inside of the studio (reverb). For example, when you speak or sing in the bathroom, that echo is reverb. All rooms have reverb. For recording vocals and mixing, you want minimal reverb. For live instruments, controlling the reverb but still keeping some reverb is often better.\n\nIf you’ve done my window plug without the additional MDF over the front, you’ve turned your windows into a dual purpose soundproofing and acoustic panel window. This will help with reverb. You can buy pre-made frames from ATS Acoustics or GIK Acoustics or make your own frames and fill them with acoustic insulation and use a staple gun and acoustic fabric to make them. If you’re in Los Angeles, you can usually find people selling them on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.\n\nReducing reflections creates better vocal recordings.\n\nPeople often ask me, if reverb sounds good, why not record vocals in a room with reverb? Why record with no reverb and then add it in the mix later?\n\nWhen you add reverb in a mix/DAW, you want to put the reverb as a send or at the end of the vocal chain after EQ and compression. That way, the bad frequencies aren’t being amplified by the reverb.\n\nLets say a vocal has too much 300hz. Place that vocalist in an untreated room and that frequency will bounce around the room and back into the mic. Now you have to EQ out both the source (vocalist) and sound of that frequency bouncing around the room. Resulting in over-EQing the vocal and a thinner vocal sound.\n\nAlso, tuning software like Auto Tune works by changing the pitch of each note. If that note contains over-hanging reverb tails of the previous note, you get this weird out of pitch reverb effect behind your vocals.\n\nSmall rooms found in most houses have a terrible sound for vocals. Reverb plugins simulate concert halls and large rooms, not bedrooms lol.\n\nReducing reflections creates a more accurate mixing environment.\n\nSimilar to the sound of your voice bouncing around the room causing a build up of certain frequencies, the same happens for speakers.\n\nPutting an expensive pair of studio monitors into an untreated room is not very smart because all that extra money you spent buying something more accurate is undone by the acoustics of the room messing up that accuracy.\n\nThat means you’ll be making mixing decisions that won’t translate to other speakers and environments and you’ll be over-EQing an over compensating for issues that are a result of the room reflections. You’ll be surprised how much more accurate and better your speakers will sound in an acoustically treated room.\n\nWhere Will You Sit?\n\nBefore you work out where to put the acoustic panels, you have to work out where you’re going to sit. If the room is rectangle, make the short wall where you will put your desk. For a square shaped room, you’re going to need thicker acoustic panels and more bass traps.\n\nIf your monitor speakers are hard up against the front wall, you might be able to get away with not putting any panels there. After all, most studios with a live band room have a glass window there but the thing is the speakers are close to the wall.\n\nIt is best to avoid sitting in the center of the room whenever possible. If you must sit in the center, you will need more bass trapping and more acoustic panels.\n\nAcoustic Panel Placement\n\nYou might want to install the corners, ceiling and front wall (if any) panels before furnishing the studio. The others are a little easier to do later since they will be more out of the way.\n\nReflection Points and Speaker Positioning\n\nMonitor Speakers should be in an equilateral triangle from the sound engineer’s listening position as below.\n\nThe above picture ideal for a pro studio. For a home studio, you’ll likely have doors, cupboards and window shelves stopping from doing at least one of these.\n\nThe reflection and mirror points can be found literally by sitting in the mix position and having a friend walk around the room with a mirror, holding the mirror flat and parallel against the wall. Turn your head and see when you see the speakers. Those are the reflection points.\n\nBass Traps\n\nBass traps are either 4″ thick panels instead of 2″ or are triangle corners filled with insulation like you see in the image below. It’s best to put bass traps in the corners. These are the hardest to make yourself as it involves cutting many triangles and stacking them together.\n\nGIK Acoustics and ATS Acoustics make triangle corner bass traps but they’re expensive if you want them to go all the way up to the ceiling. Auralex made foam bass traps also and while aren’t as good as those from GIK and ATS, they’re a little smaller and cheaper and are surprisingly useful and useful for spaces where you can’t fit a GIK or ATS trap.\n\nAn alternative is to triangle corner panels is to take panels of 4″ thickness or more and straddle them between two corners. This works best when the back of the panels also has fabric wrapped insulation instead of a wooden back. ATS and GIK panels are fabric wrapped on the front and back so they work fine. Most are made this way. They still sounds pretty good. You can do this for all corners in the room but the door and cupboards will make that difficult.\n\nOther than the corners, bass traps are best placed at the reflection points and on the rear wall.\n\nHow to hang acoustic panels in an apartment.\n\nMost likely, there probably won’t be a stud where you want to place an acoustic panel.\n\nIn an apartment, you probably don’t want to loose your security deposit. Using a couple of nails or screws is not enough to support the weight of an acoustic panel (unless you hit a stud).\n\nFor drywall/most apartments, my suggestion is to use Ook Hooks. You can find them at most hardware stores and Amazon.\n\nI like the 75 lb. Tremor Hanger. It only makes 3 tiny pin sized holes but it will hold an acoustic panel as long as you don’t constantly bump it from the bottom all the time.\n\nI doubt it would hold 75 lbs but a regular sized 2×4 acoustic panel will most likely be fine. If you have a solid wood MDF back on it, you might want to be safer and use two of them instead of one.\n\nWhen you move out, all you have to do is grab some joint compound or drywall mud from your local hardware store, pull the pins out of the hook, place a tiny dab of compound on your finger and fill the hole. If the walls are white, it will probably be un-noticeable if you scrape most of the filler off with a putty knife before it dries but you can also paint it.\n\nIf you own the property\n\nFor homeowners, once you are completely sure of the location, a snap toggle bolt will be stronger than an Ook Hook and will probably hold forever no matter how many times you bump the panel. It will leave a large hole in the wall though if you want to ever move the wall which will need joint compound and sanding to fix as well as painting if you want it to be invisible.\n\nIf you think you might take the panels down one day, I’d still go with an Ook Hook.\n\nWarning about dangerously made acoustic panels\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people selling home made acoustic panels on Craigslist that are very unsafe. Acoustic panels should always be 100% sealed in fabric and wood. You should not see any holes or exposed insulation.\n\nI’ve seen many people buy, sell and make acoustic panels with no fabric or wood on the back, just exposed insulation. Insulation is meant to go into sealed walls and ceilings. It’s not safe to live with unexposed insulation. They have to be sealed.\n\nAt best, exposed acoustic panels will make you itchy and irritate your your skin. At worst, it can cause breathing issues, lung problems and possibly cancer due to formaldehyde, a known carcinogenic (reason for the Prop 65 warning). Hanging the exposed side on the wall is not good enough. Insulation fibers can still come loose.\n\nThe amount of acoustic panels with exposed insulation in home studios right now is scary. This is what happens when people aren’t educated. There is a lot of mis-information online but all insulation companies and acoustic panel makes agree is that it’s not safe to live with exposed insulation.\n\nFiberglass is more dangerous than rock wool but even Roxul Safe n Sound is only ‘safe’ if you’re not living with it exposed. Don’t let the name Safe n Sound fool you. That’s because it’s fireproof and it’s safer than non-fireproof insulation when placed in the wall. That doesn’t make it safe to breath in and live with exposed.\n\nProof for Cynical People\n\nWe live in crazy times where some people even believe the world is flat. Trying to convince people some idiots to cover acoustic panels is not easy so let’s expand on this a little further…\n\nTo quote Roxul’s own safety sheet; “If the intended use of the article requires it to be installed, and under normal conditions of use, will not release or otherwise cause an individual to be exposed to a hazardous product…. This product may cause temporary mechanical irritation to the eyes and skin. Temporary irritation of the upper respiratory tract (scratchy throat, coughing, congestion) may result from exposure to dusts and fibers in excess of applicable exposure limits.\n\nHanging exposed insulation on the wall is not it’s “intended installation and use.”\n\nHaving an “irritated respiratory tract” does not sound like a good thing for a vocalist.\n\nThe safety data sheet for Owens Corning 703 is says to wear an N95 mask, long sleeves and to cover all skin. That doesn’t sound like something you should hang uncovered on your wall.\n\nAcoustic panels have been used on walls in professional recording studios for a long time without any lawsuits or complaints so the general consensus seems to be that as long as they are covered with fabric, they should be safe but I’d avoid anything with a very loose weave like the loose weave burlap.\n\nSafe Fabrics\n\nYou want to pick a safe fabric to wrap Acoustic Panels.\n\nIf you’re making your own acoustic panels you can wrap them in Gillford Marine acoustic fabric (fire retardant acoustic fabric), Speaker Grill Fabric (not fire retardant) or any fabric with a tight weave that you can blow through and feel your breath from the other side. If you can blow through it but the weave is tight enough to keep all the fibers in, it will allow the sound to pass through without letting the fibers escape.\n\nHow to Make DIY Acoustic Panels\n\nNow that you know what acoustic panels should look like, making your own Acoustic panels is as simple as making a wooden frame, filling it with rockwool/Roxul Safe n Sound or Roxul Rockboard or Owens Corning OC703 and wrapping it in fabric.\n\nIf you’re handy with tools you can give this a go. Otherwise, GIK sell bare frames for fairly cheap if you don’t have a shed or tools or want an easier way to make them.\n\nI’d suggest looking up some videos on how to wrap/stretch canvas on YouTube for stretching the fabric nicely. Don’t look at the DIY acoustic panel videos on YouTube, they suck and will give you terrible advice. I’ll probably make a proper video at some point.\n\nPre-made Acoustic Panels\n\nMaking acoustic panels takes quite a bit of time and patience. It can save you money but if you’re not on a tight budget, ATS Acoustics and GIK Acoustics are the top two companies that mass produce acoustic panels for shipping across the US. The microsuede bezel edge acoustic panels from ATS are the nicest I have seen but they’re also the most expensive.\n\nAcoustic Foam\n\nMost people use acoustic foam for home studios because it’s just sitting there in every music store waiting for you to buy it and the sales person wants to sell it to you.\n\nFoam doesn’t absorb much under 500hz so it’s not ideal. Auralex foam is better than most cheaper foam but it’s still no where near as good as acoustic panels and usually ends up costing more as you need more foam that you would acoustic panels.\n\nWith acoustic panels, you never need to cover the whole wall with them. With foam, you often need to cover the whole wall to get a similar effect and even after covering the whole wall, you’ll still have a build up of low mid bass which can sometimes make a room sound worse than it was before.\n\nThat makes foam actually more expensive because you need more of it. Also, people tend to do dumb things like attach it to the wall with a staple gun, leaving more holes and many staples in the wall than if you were to hang acoustic panels with Ook Hooks which would actually cause less damage.\n\nYou should buy Acoustic Panels instead if you don’t want to make them.\n\nIf you’re in the US and don’t want to be bothered making your own acoustic panels, I’d suggest getting some acoustic panels from either ATS Acoustics, GIK Acoustics, or from random people on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace if they’re made properly.\n\nAre those Primeacousitc brand panels any good?\n\nMusic stores have started stocking Primacousitc brand acoustic panels. This is because they have no frame and are lighter so it solves a lot of logistics and shipping issues. The frame is made from fiberglass though and will crack if dropped.\n\nHowever, since they have no frame, you can’t hang them like a normal acoustic panel with hooks. The back is not covered in fabric but coated in resin which you have to puncture when you install their own provided hanging puncture tool thing.\n\nThis is fine if you get the location right the first time and never move them but if you ever take them off the wall, they’re not safe anymore as they have a hole on the back exposing insulation.\n\nAlso, if you bump the corners on them, they will crumble, exposing insulation.\n\nI’ve bought these in the past myself and ended up using spray glue and acoustic fabric to repair the back of them as well as attaching heavy duty velcro to the back so they can be hung without breaking them each time.\n\nI also pulled back the stock fabric and re-enforced the corners with Gorilla Glue and extra fabric to make them stronger.\n\nDoing all off that was actually harder than making my own acoustic panels lol. Since then, I’ve just made my own acoustic panels.\n\nI would say they are fine for a once off install, assuming you line them up the first time and never move them. Other than that, it is hard to recommend them when there are other companies out there making better built acoustic panels.\n\nDiffusion\n\nMost home recording studios are too small for diffusion to be useful but it’s often placed on the rear wall in larger studios. It helps bounce sound around the room which can give dull rooms a little more life.\n\nFurniture\n\nBefore you start loading your studio with gear, have a think about studio furniture.\n\nArgosy and Sterling Modular make most of the furniture you see in professional recording studios in the US.\n\nHowever, these days there are lots of cheaper options for the home studio market but they are usually more ugly and cheaper looking.\n\nDIY is a good option if you have a shed or know someone that can help.\n\nDIY Studio Desk\n\nOr if you’re handy with tools, you might be able to make a desk yourself that you’ll be happy with.\n\nHere is a desk I made from a sit and stand desk frame a kitchen counter top and dismantling the keybed from a midi keyboard to building it into a custom keyboard tray.\n\nThis desk lives in one of the room at my own studio in Hollywood, Current Sound. For this design, I’m using 500 series racks instead of 19″ racks which is a pretty simple desk to build and still keeps your outboard close to you. The best part of this setup is that the whole desk is motorized so the desk, speakers and keyboard all move up and down.\n\nThe most expensive part of the furniture was the motorized frame. I used the Jarvis extended width frame which was $454 and a $100 Ikea kitchen counter top butcher block. So all up it was around $550 for the parts before taxes and shipping.\n\nI put wooden inserts into the bottom of the table for the keyboard tray and frame but I’m not gonna lie, it wasn’t easy. You can just use regular wood screws if you’re not planning on pulling it apart again.\n\nLarge 19″ racks take up a lot of space. So to keep it sleek and to maximize the space I’m using 500 series racks instead. The 500 series racks have the same functionality and similar quality as their large 19″ rack versions but are very small and sit on top of the desk within reach, barely taking up any room.\n\nThe second clever part about this design is that I have a 88 note hammer action keybed mounted under the desk. This is important for me as I’m a trained pianist and I’m constantly playing in piano and synth parts.\n\nThe desk moves up and down so I can change the height for ideal typing height or ideal piano playing height.\n\nDIY 19″ Rack Desk\n\nIf you’re buying a lot of outboard and 19″ racks. You’re going to need to put them somewhere. Most people setting up a home studio don’t have many or any 19″ racks at first but if you’re going to be recording a full band, you’re going to need more inputs and some racks unless you want to go 500 series. (more on 500 series later).\n\nYou can buy 19″ rack rails for cheap online if you want to try to make your own desk. With some basic woodworking skills, you can probably make something better than you can buy.\n\nI made the one in my old studio myself. The rack part is just an MDF enclosure 19″ wide with a brace along the top and bottom at the back and open at the front made into a leg that attaches to the top of the desk with corner brace brackets.\n\nI undercoated it then spray painted it with Rustoleum satin-gloss spray paint.\n\nIf you make your own desk, you can personalize it more.\n\nYou might not need to DIY a desk.\n\nIf you don’t have a lot of racks, bending down a little to get to your racks might be fine if you’re not tweaking them much. In that case, you could just get a simple rack tray to put under your desk like an Argosy Rack N’ Roll rack unit.\n\nThen you can just use a regular desk on the top if you like.\n\nSomething like that will set you back around $450 which is not bad considering most 19″ racks cost over that each anyway.\n\nArgosy\n\nArgosy desks are expensive. You’ve most likely seen them in photos of professional recording studios.\n\nThey’re a great option if you have 19″ rack gear that you want to have within reach.\n\nMaking something like this yourself isn’t easy unless you have killer carpentry skills.\n\nThis one is the Dual 15. It costs a whopping $2500. That puts it out of the budget for most home studio but some people do still put them in their home studios.\n\nHowever, the Argosy Halo is a little more in reach. Still expensive at around $1700, for serious home studio setups, if you have the budget for it, it’s a great way to organize the gear in your home studio.\n\nYes to answer what you’re thinking. You’re paying $1700 for some wood and metal legs. None of the gear you see comes with it.\n\nIt’s nothing like Ikea desks though. It’s better than what you could pay a carpenter to build for you and often works out cheaper than paying a professional carpenter.\n\nAffordable Rack desk\n\nThere are some affordable rack desks for a few hundred dollars or so available at Sweetwater and on Amazon. Usually advertised as a ‘studio workstation’.\n\nThey don’t look great by themselves but once you start to add some stuff to the, they can look ok. They do help with organizing your gear.\n\nIf you get creative with the lighting. Even a simple desk can look cool.\n\nSterling Modular Rack Desk\n\nSterling Modular also make cool rack desks here in the US but they are aimed directly at professional sound engineers by solving ergonomic problems. Although they are great for mixing, for integrating keyboards, drum machines and other devices, they don’t leave much room for anything like that.\n\nStudioDesk Brand Desks\n\nArgosy is a US company and they’re expensive to ship outside the US. StudioDesk is a better option for most people in Europe and they look equally as cool and unlike Argosy, also come in white and black and white option.\n\nSpeaker Stands vs Speakers on the Table\n\nMost people would say speaker stands are better. In most cases they are. However, in home studios, not always because the rooms are small. You want to sit in the first 1/3rd of the room. The worst place to sit in the room is in the middle. If you sit in the middle, you’ll get some phase cancellation and nodes. Without explaining what that means in detail basically, the sound you hear from your speakers in the center of the room is not accurate. If you must sit in the center due to having a very small square shaped room, you need to go crazy with more acoustic panels and bass trapping.\n\nWhether you should put the speakers on the desk or on stands will depend on where you need to sit to not be in the center. Stands go behind the desk. That means your desk is further away from the wall which means you’ll be sitting closer to the middle of the room. In most home studios, if the room is less than 10ft long, often placing the speakers on the table is better. For that, I’d recommend Iso-Acoustics speaker stands or Primacoustic recoil stabilizer stands.\n\nIf you have flat desk, Iso-Acoustic Stands are better. If you have a rack desk and the speakers are sitting on top of a rack shelf, the Primacoustic stands are better. The reason is, the tweeter of the speakers should be at ear height and the Iso-Acousitc stands are higher.\n\nSo Can You Work Out What’s Wrong With This Photo Now?\n\nLet’s use what I taught you earlier to spot all the problems of this setup…\n\nIncorrect Speaker Positioning\n\nThere are unused speaker stands on the console meter bridge which appear to be in the correct position but instead are filled with junk lol.\n\nThe speakers where they are at the moment on the stands are too too wide for the equilateral triangle position to be correct.\n\nThe desk should either come forward so the speakers can be placed behind the desk or to keep the extra floor space, the speakers could be placed on the meter bridge on the included speaker stands with either Recoil Stablizers or low profile Iso Acoustics stands under them.\n\nSound Proofing Issues\n\nYou can see an untreated window to the left which is going to let most of the sound in and out of the room.\n\nI will point out though, in some super expensive modern high end apartments, for sound isolation, the windows are double pane or even better double layer safety glass with an airgap but most of the time, they’re not and are a soundproofing nightmare.\n\nThe vocal booth is nice though.\n\nAcoustic Issues\n\nToo bad that the position of that nice vocal booth creates an extra corner behind the left speaker but it doesn’t have any corner bass trapping behind it, creating a build up of subs and bass from that one side and corner. So that makes the left speaker less accurate than the right speaker.\n\nThe speakers are worth 10k and the mixer is worth 77k connected to a 20k ProTools HDX setup but you can’t mix in the room because the sound won’t be accurate due to the acoustics.\n\nThere are also no acoustic panels at the first reflection points. The window to the left just happens to be the first reflection point to the listening position. Even if you’re not going to seal off the window for soundproofing, you could place a floor-standing/free standing acoustic panel there to stop a lot of the sound being reflected back to the listening position.\n\nGiven that acoustic panels can be purchased for around hundred dollars or so each or made yourself even cheaper, it doesn’t make sense to be putting 150k worth of gear into a room with no acoustic treatment. The acoustics are causing a major bottle neck to the accuracy of all of the equipment.\n\nThe result of mixing in this room will likely be a mix that will not translate well, despite having top of the line equipment.\n\nMic Storage\n\nThis one you probably didn’t notice but 30k worth vocal mics are sitting on separate stands instead of being stored in their cases with a desiccant which means eventually the capsules will degrade and they’ll break. Maybe they were just displayed for the photo but given that there is only one vocal booth and recording area, it’s likely they are always kept this way.\n\nDon’t keep your mics out on stands or they won’t last long. Unlike stage microphones, moisture can destroy studio condenser mics. You should keep them in a mic pouch or their included case. Place a desiccant near the head of the mic resting against the side that you sing/rap/speak into.\n\nA desiccant won’t last forever but you can heat them up in the oven for a little bit and it will dry it out again and they’ll start working again\n\nMore Money Than Skills\n\nSo this is just an example of someone who has way more money than skills. Most likely, they don’t know how to mix and use that desk.\n\nFor the price they paid, they could have easily bought some acoustic panels and bass traps, positioned the monitor speakers correctly and stored their mics correctly so they wouldn’t be destroyed by moisture.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of expensive home recording studios like this in LA with similar mistakes. Try not to put your money into the wrong areas. Not paying attention to the acoustics and speaker positioning creates serious bottle necks and can make your expensive studio monitors quite useless and inaccurate.\n\nImproving the Vibe of Your Home Recording Studio\n\nI’m mentioning this now because it’s hard and often impossible to do once you fill your room with gear. This is one of the reasons you rarely see home studios looking like this but with a little prepping and effort, you can improve the vibe of your home studio.\n\nPaint, wallpaper and Lighting\n\nLighting\n\nYou’ll be surprised how much of a different lighting can make to the vibe and feel of your studio. That’s why professional studios always have killer lighting. Have a think about putting some LED strips and cool lights up.\n\nPaint and Wallpaper\n\nYou might not be able to get permission to paint your apartment but if you google ‘apartment wallpaper’ or ‘non-woven wallpaper’ you’ll find a lot of wallpaper that is easy to remove. The wallpaper I used in my studio is a non-woven wallpaper but unfortunately it’s been discontinued but there is plenty of cool wallpaper out there. The main downside to wallpaper is it takes longer to put up and costs more than painting the room but it can look more pretty if done right. If you’re stuck at home during Covid-19 and want to pimp out your home recording studio, this could be a fun project for you.\n\nTips for Buying Gear\n\nMost people skimp on something when they start a home studio.\n\nOften it’s better to just save up a little more to get what you actually want if they’re not that far off from each other in price.\n\nAlthough you can easily sell most recording gear on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, eBay and Reverb.com when you want to upgrade, you’re probably going to loose a 3rd to half of what you paid for the item new.\n\nNew recording studio items usually come with a manufacturer’s warranty if you purchase it from an authorized reseller. Amazon and Ebay alone are not authorized resellers since they sell items from other sellers and individuals.\n\nIf you’re buying on Amazon you want to make sure it “Sold by Amazon” not “Fulfilled by Amazon”. If it is “Fulfilled by Amazon”, it’s actually sold by someone else.\n\nAlthough Amazon itself is usually an Authorized reseller, other sellers on Amazon are usually not. That someone else would need to be an Authorized reseller such as a music store for it to be sold with a warranty. Most sellers on Amazon are not Authorized resellers. Rode actually has a problem with counterfeit Rode mics on from 3rd party sellers on Amazon.\n\nIf you don’t buy studio gear from an Authorized reseller and your item breaks a year later, you might have to pay for the repair or replacement cost out of your own pocket.\n\nThe warranty also goes out the window if you buy them item used.\n\nSo what are your chances a used item going to break anyway? Well, that depends. It might be much higher than you think…\n\nBuying Used Items\n\nBuying used is not for everyone. It can save you money but it an also cause you drama. Buying audio gear is risky and closer to buying a used car than it is to buying a used sofa. There is lots going on under the hood that can go wrong.\n\nIf you’re planning on taking the risk in buying used studio gear, you need to be aware of a few things first and know what to look for…\n\nThe biggest issue with buying used recording gear is that with electronics, there is a lot that can go wrong or degrade over time. The newer an item is, the less likely this will be a factor but how it was treated makes a much bigger difference than even the age of the item.\n\nFor example, condenser microphones can easily be degraded by smoke and moisture so buying them used is not so straight forward. There will always be some risk.\n\nAlmost all analogue consoles require regular maintenance to keep working. To quote the guy who bought the mixing console from the old Sound City studios;\n\n“When we installed the board at my studio, we had to open it up and clean it out. There was like, 40 years of cocaine and fried chicken in that thing.”\n\nDave Grohl\n\nWhat to look for when buying used?\n\nIf you’re going to buy a used condenser mic, I’d suggest only buying it from the original owner and asking them how it was stored when not in use and whether they smoke in their studio or not. A condenser microphone that is was used in a smoke free studio, wiped down after each use and stored with a desiccant in a case, will usually last a long time.\n\nWork out if you think you can trust the seller. Ebay and Reverb are good since you can look back at previous reviews to help ease your mind a little bit. Buying from a Pawn Shop is very risky, you have no idea how the item was treated beforehand.\n\nLuckily, most people selling items from their home studio and treating studio gear badly don’t even know what they’re doing is bad for the gear so they’ll probably tell you. Here is a typical conversation I usually have….\n\nMe: “Do you have a case for it?”, seller “No”. “What did you store it in?” Seller, “What do you mean?”. Me: “Sorry, not interested.” This is an example of a seller that left his microphone on the stand all the time and it’s probably fu*ked up.\n\nI’m not saying you should never buy something that might have been treated badly but the price needs to make sense as it is a gamble.\n\nUsed items that need software licenses to run/work\n\nBuying used gear is not as simple as it used to be now that were in the digital age. Some items like Native Instruments Maschine, Komplete Kontrol, Akai MPC, UAD Apollo Devices are essentially hardware and software combo units. When you buy them new you are buying both the hardware and the software license. When you buy them used, unless the seller is the original owner and transfers the software license, you’re basically buying half of it. Without the other half, it doesn’t work.\n\nSo I know what you’re thinking, ok, just buy the hardware for cheap then buy the software. Well, Native Instruments for example will NOT sell you a license for the Maschine software separately. You would have to buy a Maschine to get it. You could buy the cheapest Maschine hardware like a Maschine Mikro for example but that might not make a lot of sense financially.\n\nUniversal Audio lock their hardware to the users account to prevent theft. Unless you have the hardware license transferred to your Universal Audio Account from the seller, you can’t install any new plugins on it.\n\nSlate Digital don’t sell their Slate VMS Software separately either. If you buy a used Slate VMS ML-1 microphone, you need to get an iLok transfer from the original owner.\n\nMy advice is to avoid buying Native Instruments or Universal Audio hardware from a Pawn Shop or music store as the hardware is usually locked to another account and you probably won’t be able to get software license for it since they don’t sell them separately. The same with the Slate VMS Microphones.\n\nWith these items you need to buy them from the original owner and have them transfer the software license to your account. That means you also have to trust the person you’re buying it from to follow through and actually transfer the software and/or hardware license to you.\n\nIf that sounds complex and scary to you, that’s because it is. You really need to know what you’re doing even if you want to buy them used from the original owner.\n\nEbay Tips\n\nMake sure you know the condition and history of what you’re buying\n\nMake sure it isn’t a device that is hardware locked or needs it’s software to run.\n\nIf it needs drivers such as an audio interface, check to see if they’re up to date with the latest operating systems. Lots of older interfaces don’t have drivers that are maintained and might not work on newer OSes.\n\nIf the price is too good to be true and the person doesn’t know what they have, it might be stolen. The police attempt to recover stolen items and you’ll the money you paid for it and your item. If you think it might be stolen, don’t buy it.\n\nIf you’re buying an item at auction, bid late. Bidding early only gives the other bidders time to increase their bids and out bid you or drive up the price.\n\nYou can use a proxy bid. Think of what you want to pay worst case scenario and place that bid towards the end of the auction and you’ll increase your chances of winning. If someone bids under your proxy bid after you, eBay will automatically increase the bid for you.\n\nIf you win but your item breaks after 30 days since you ordered it, you’re on your own. You might be able to pay for a repair through the manufacturer but sometimes it’s cheaper to keep it for spare parts or throw it out and buy another one. The labor on a repair might be more than you paid for it in the first place. You might be able to sell the broken one for spare parts on eBay.\n\nIf you’re into electronics, learning to solder and repair items might be a fun hobby for you and allow you to buy older and more risky gear on eBay to fix or maintain. Someone maintains those large analogue desks you see in older pro recording studios. They don’t magically keep working by themselves. If you don’t want to do that, be careful what you buy on eBay and stick to the newer and good condition items or play it safe and just buy brand new to begin with.\n\nYou can sometimes find ‘open box’ and ‘demo store’ items on eBay that still have warranty if you buy from an Authorized Reseller/music store on eBay like SamAsh, Sweetwater and Guitar Center for example. That way you still get the manufacturer’s warranty but it often won’t be as cheap as a used item from a random person/seller.\n\nTaking Care of Your Gear\n\nA lot of home studio guys don’t know how to take care of gear. Most home studios I see people with one microphone that they leave out on a stand in the room. As I mentioned earlier, unlike stage microphones, moisture breaks down and degrades the capsule of condenser mics. You should never leave them out. They need to go back into a case with a desiccant placed at the head of the microphones. You can use standard microphone cases but the more expensive mics often come with a case.\n\nWhy people don’t recommend ribbon mics to home studio people\n\nRibbon microphones are even more sensitive. Never enable phantom power on a ribbon microphone. Phantom power warps and fries the ribbon effectively killing the mic. Although some newer ribbon mics might have a little protection against this, many do not and they can all be killed over time.\n\nRibbon mics can also be degraded by moisture but even more so than condenser mics. Using one on vocals without a pop filter can also destroy the mic.\n\nMy suggestion would be to avoid Ribbon mics all together if you’re just starting out in recording. They’re not great for home studios because if a kid or a friend picks it up and sings into it for fun, they’ll probably break it. You’ll also probably eventually plug it into a channel with phantom power enabled by mistake and fry the mic.\n\nEssential Recording Gear\n\nSome items for a home recording studio are unavoidable. The price and quality of them vary dramatically. So how much should you spend?\n\nGenerally speaking, the more you spend, the better the quality. At some point, even though a professional mix engineer and recording engineer will be able to use them to make higher quality recordings and mixes, you won’t be able to.\n\nThat’s why it’s important not only to work\n\n1. Computer or Laptop\n\nTape machines are out. Since the 90s, computers are how music is recorded. Which one to get? PC or Mac, it doesn’t matter too much. PCs are more customizable but if you want to run Logic, you’ll need a mac, however, personally I prefer Cubase anyway. Most modern laptops aren’t customizable but are easy to take from your home studio into a professional recording studio. So for that reason, laptops are a good choice for a home studio given that modern laptops are very powerful.\n\nPC Laptop Suggestions\n\nIntel i7 or i9 Processor\n\n16gb of ram or more. The more ram the better.\n\nDedicated graphics is a plus\n\nUSB 3.0 or even better… Thunderbolt 2 or 3.\n\nThunderbolt will allow you to use any interface that has windows drivers. USB eliminates firewire and thunderbolt interfaces. Most firewire and thunderbolt interfaces have lower latency than USB with the exception of some RME USB interfaces. Thunderbolt can get ultra low latency. I’d do an article on latency later.\n\nBrands and Models\n\nGaming laptops such as the Razer Blade, Asus Rog, MSI gaming laptops and Alienware all have high end parts, superior cooling, run fairly quiet and can run for long periods without overheating. Some models also have thunderbolt. This makes them a good choice, although they are a little pricey. You can always look on ebay. You don’t need the latest model since you don’t need the most powerful graphics card for DAW and recording work so you can often pickup older models for great prices used. Some older models can also be upgraded.\n\nI put 3x SSD drives in mine for 6tb of SSD storage and upgraded the ram to 32gb. I’m using a thicker Asus Rog g751 (pictured on the right). The fan is pretty quiet that you can get away with recording in the same room with it and usually only ramps up when bouncing down a mix. The newer model is the massive g703 which is a killer laptop with thunderbolt that offers desktop performance in a laptop. The i9 model is 8 cores at 4.7ghz making it insanely fast. If you got that, you’re probably not going to need to upgrade your laptop for 5-10 years. Their GL line is there slimmer line but most of the GL line doesn’t have thunderbolt. The Razer blade is very slim and has thunderbolt if you want something thinner.\n\nThick Vs Thin\n\nKeep in mind that thinner laptops run hotter due to having smaller fans. When a laptop overheats, it throttles and slows down. The thicker ones have bigger fans and can run at full speed without slowing down as they can pump out a lot of heat. In saying that, unless you’re producing, mixing and mastering all on the one session or doing production for film, you most likely won’t need all that power.\n\nRunning hotter means lower life expectancy of your laptop if you’re going to be a heavy user. You have to think, are you going to be taking your laptop around to make music on the go each day and carry it around all day. Or do you want something that is going to sit on your desk that you might move occasionally into a professional studio or take to a friend’s studio?\n\nIf you’re not going to be moving your laptop much, I’d suggest a thicker laptop with better thermals and more internal hard drive storage space. These are commonly called ‘desktop replacement’ laptops. They are a trade off in portability for an increase in speed, storage space and reliability.\n\nThin laptops don’t magically break the laws of physics. They run hot and slow. If you’re just a casual user ‘making beats’ using a few loops, you’ll barely need any power but if you’re going to load up your session with virtual instruments, play all of your own parts and melodies and mix and master all your owns songs, you can easily max out a lower spec’ed laptop.\n\nDo you need a desktop computer?\n\nThe guys that do orchestral scoring often have massively powerful desktop computers either 16 or 32 core and sometimes even have a master machine and a slave machine, two high spec’ed computers using Vienna Ensemble Pro. So if you’re getting into film composition and doing orchestral scoring, even the fastest laptop might not be fast enough and you might have to go with a higher spec’ed desktop.\n\nMac Laptop Suggestions\n\nMacbook Pro i7 or i9 with thunderbolt. More ram the better. The more storage the better. Macs are pricey when upgrading them from Apple. The newer models don’t have upgradable parts period. Apple makes a lot of money by selling extra storage and ram at a premium. In the past, you could take it apart yourself and upgrade the ram and hard drives and pay significantly less buy buying the components and doing it yourself. These days, they stop you from doing that by soldering the cpu, ram and hard drives to the motherboard! So you can’t upgrade them.\n\nAll MacBooks run pretty hot. All macs run pretty hot actually but if you’re going to be running it for 12 hours a day everyday, the life expectancy is low. The average lifespan of a Macbook is only 4 years for a typical user.\n\nIf you have heavy sessions with lots of plugins and virtual instruments 8 hours or more each day, you’re not an average user. Don’t expect it to last too long.\n\nSo if you’re doing music from home full-time, you might wanna go with an iMac instead. The new mac pro is over-priced but it’s also an option. Macs tend to overheat and throttle but most of their users aren’t pushing them hard all of the time. Even most home studio users aren’t pushing them hard all of the time.\n\nI’ll Admit – I Don’t Like Apple\n\nAs you can tell, I’m not an Apple fan. That makes me less likely to suggest a mac. Most young people are told that Mac’s are better for music. That’s because MacOS used to be much better for music than Windows. Since Windows 7, and now with Windows 10, the OS isn’t holding you back. Around 20 years ago, some smart guys hacked MacOS and made it run on PC components. And… It ran faster! Since then Apple started using Intel and PC components in their Macs. They bought Logic from Emagic and place Garage Band on all macs and give apple loops to everyone.\n\nThe reality is, Apple want you to think Macs are better for music but they’re the same hardware, it’s just the OS and software that is different. You can get the same and better software for the PC anyway but the cost of Logic is cheap compared to the other top DAWs so it might be worthwhile to go Mac if you want to use Logic as your DAW.\n\nBut I’ve recommended Macbooks\n\nEven though I don’t like Apple I’ve still recommended Macbooks to students of mine because Logic does give you a lot of stock loops and built-in plugins and they’re very portable.\n\nMy personal thoughts are, the stock plugins and virtual instruments that come with Logic aren’t as good as 3rd party alternatives but they’re cheap and Logic is excellent value considering what they give you. That’s why Macbooks are so popular. If you’re not using Logic though or you want to pimp out all the specs of a Macbook, it starts to make less sense.\n\nAlso Universal Audio’s Luna only runs on Mac at the moment which is a great option for home recording studios. It will also load Logic’s AU plugins.\n\nCertain Apogee interfaces also only run on Mac but that’s just their personal preference. After AVID rebranded some of their interfaces and made windows drivers for them, then Apogee released the windows drivers for their products. That’s means they’re too lazy to make them but all of their devices could run on Windows if they’re weren’t idiots and would just make the drivers for them.\n\nUniversal Audio used to be Mac only as well but now they make windows drivers. I can vouch for them and say their drivers are rock solid. I’ve used their devices on both Windows and Mac.\n\nWhy Upgrading to a New a Recording Studio Computer is Hard\n\nFor most people, upgrading to a new computer is easy. Buy a new computer and install a few programs. Maybe you have to buy Microsoft Office again.\n\nFor upgrading a studio computer, you have to install and register every plugin you have. For a professional or serious home studio, that could be thousands of individual programs/plugins that you have to install.\n\nAlthough lots of plugins run a license on an iLok, many do not. The home studio boom has actually caused many pro audio software companies to go back to using serial numbers or online activation. Sometimes you can activate another license on another computer, sometimes you can’t.\n\nOften your software is linked to the hardware ID of your computer. That means when you buy a new computer, you either have to contact the software company to deactivate the old license or purchase a completely new software license.\n\nUn-registering a piece of software from one computer to move to another means your studio is down until you completely swap over to the new system. That might not be an issue for a home recording studio but for a professional recording studio like mine, downtime = loss of income.\n\nFor a serious recording studio, changing the computer can literally be weeks worth of installing programs, drivers and dealing with activation and license issues.\n\nEven if you use Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner (on mac) or Acronis on PC to migrate your old computer OS and software to a new computer, a lot of the software will be unregistered as the hardware ID will change. Re-activation is still an issue.\n\nSo Pimp Out Your Computer\n\nSince re-buying software is annoying and re-installing software is very time consuming, I tend to go overkill on my recording studio computers. If the computer lasts you longer, you’ll save time and money.\n\nIf you’re just making a simple home studio, maybe you don’t need a very powerful computer.\n\nHowever, if you’re going to be learning to mix or playing the piano and using the latest virtual instruments, I’d suggest buying something faster than you think you need.\n\n2. DAW\n\nPersonally, I believe the DAW you use does not matter. I have an whole article about that here. The best plugins are 3rd party ones, not the ones that come with a DAW so the difference between DAWs is really the workflow and features of the DAW.\n\nI’ll give a small bit of advice below in regards to workflow but the best option is just to try them out for yourself.\n\nSmall Note About Logic Pro X\n\nIf you want to use Logic Pro X, you have to buy a Mac. There is no way around it, unless your super tech savvy and want to build a Hackintosh. Hackintosh is a hacked PC that runs MacOS. It’s only for the super tech savvy.\n\nThe good thing about Logic, is it’s only $200 and you get a lot of plugins and virtual instruments included. Apple probably makes no profit from Logic directly. It used to cost around $2000 (two thousand dollars) when it was owned by Emagic. Apple bought the company, discontinued the PC version and dropped the price to $200 to make people buy a mac if they wanted to use it. The good news is you get great value for money. The bad news is you need to buy a mac.\n\nI wouldn’t suggest buying a mac just so you can use Logic as there are many other DAWs with the features of Logic.\n\nAlthough, it is good value if you buy a more budget Macbook. Once you max out a Macbook or you go to a iMac or Mac Pro, you start to offset and move past the savings since pimped out macs are significantly more expensive than similarly spec’ed PCs and PC laptops.\n\nSo for a pimped out, more high end system, a DAW that runs on a PC might be cheaper overall depending on the DAW you choose.\n\nSmall Note About Universal Audio Luna\n\nLuna is a very new DAW from Universal Audio that came out in Summer 2020 and requires both a Universal Apollo interface and a mac. They might release a PC version in the future but will not confirm at this time.\n\nTheir Apollo interfaces work on PC and their console app works on PC for no latency monitoring but the full DAW Luna doesn’t have a PC version at the moment.\n\nPresently their is no external control surface support for Luna.\n\nLuna is free if you own an Apollo interface and a Mac. That makes it a no brainer if you were planning on buying a mac and an Apollo interface anyway except for those that need external control surface support and more advance features.\n\nIf you have a Mac and a Universal Audio Apollo interface, I’d recommend trying Luna first to see if you like the workflow given that it comes at no additional cost.\n\nPicking a DAW\n\nRemember, all of these can use 3rd party plugins and instruments. Almost all major plugin manufactures make their plugins that work in all of these DAWs, meaning you can use the same 3rd party plugins in any of the DAWs anyway. None of the DAWs come with amazing plugins in my opinion. The best ones are the 3rd party ones anyway. So choose a DAW is more about workflow than the stuff it comes with.\n\nApple Logic Pro X\n\nThe best thing about logic is both it’s ease of use and it’s price. For the price you can’t beat it if you already have a mac but if you’re buying a mac so you can use it, you might want to look into other options.\n\nLogic comes with a bunch of plugins and has lots of features making it good value which is why it’s so popular in home studios.\n\nApple Logic Pro X $199. Mac only.\n\nFree updates for life.\n\nHas a lot of instruments and loops included.\n\nRequires a mac.\n\nSmall learning curve.\n\nSteinberg Cubase Pro\n\nAlthough, what I use doesn’t matter as you should pick a DAW for your own workflow but personally I use Cubase by Steinberg. It doesn’t come with as many plugins as Logic but it has more advanced features plus almost all of Logic’s features as well as most of Pro Tool’s features.\n\nIt’s pricey but you don’t have to buy a mac. Cubase is popular among the biggest Hollywood flim composers like Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL but it’s way less common in home studios, mostly due to it’s price and the fact that it’s more complex to learn and it’s easy to get lost in all of it’s advanced features. It’s most popular among keyboard players and it has a lot of customization options, more than in other DAWs.\n\nWho is it best for?\n\nThis is a good DAW for advanced users and those that want to get into sound engineering, professional music production, serious composition and film scoring. If you play the piano or want to record a full band, this is probably the DAW for you.\n\nFor most artists, it might seem a little too advanced and overwhelming. They do make a cheaper, cut down ‘Artist’ version but in my opinion, the artist version is not as good as ‘Presonus Studio One’ which is little more ‘artist friendly’. This is more of an advanced, full fledged DAW that replaces both Logic and Pro Tools and has most of their features plus it’s own unique features.\n\nSteinberg Cubase Pro $588. PC or Mac.\n\nUpdates average to $75 a year.\n\nA little less instruments and loops included.\n\nMore advance audio features than Ableton.\n\nMore advanced audio features than Logic, more on par with Pro Tools.\n\nLots of advanced midi features, more than Pro Tools.\n\nSteeper learning curve.\n\nMost popular among Hollywood film composers due to folder tracks, filtering tracks and preset management.\n\nGood choice for recording live bands due to the control room mixer and virtual headphone sends.\n\nPresonus Studio One\n\nFor someone starting out, Studio One is by far the easiest DAW to use as everything is drag and drop. It is quicker to learn and easy to use.\n\nThe ease of use comes at a cost of efficiency though as a keyboard shortcut "
