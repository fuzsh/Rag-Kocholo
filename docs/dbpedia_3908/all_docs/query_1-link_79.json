        "text": "Image via “Feel Like A Stranger” (Live from MSG on 3/9/81) YouTube video\n\nThe Grateful Dead have announced that they’ll release a new limited edition CD boxset titled In And Out Of The Garden: Madison Square Garden ’81, ’82, ’83, set to release on Sept. 23. The box set will offer six previously unreleased live concert recordings from New York’s Madison Square Garden between 1981 and 1983.\n\nThe 17 CD boxset is now available for preorder and features a custom box artwork by Dave Van Patten and detailed liner notes by renowned music journalist David Fricke, which examine to band’s connection to New York City. The In And Out Of The Garden boxsets will be numbered and limited to 12,500 copies, a three-CD version featuring a concert from March 9, 1981, will also be available along with digital downloads. The special release was mastered by Jeffery Norman and features restored and speed-corrected audio by Plangent Processes.\n\nIn conjunction with the boxset’s release, The Grateful Dead shared a recording of “Feel Like A Stranger” Live from MSG on March 9, 1981, which will be featured on the boxset. Of the track Grateful Dead archivist and legacy manager David Lemieux said, ““Since its debut in 1980, ‘Feel Like A Stranger’ offered the Grateful Dead another song with plenty of room internally to stretch out. By a year into its life, the song often went to nearly 10 minutes, and often opened shows. This rendition from March 9, 1981, is driven with the controlled chaos that is the Grateful Dead at their best.”\n\nIt’s notable that the recordings, which capture an often overlooked era of the Grateful Dead, feature keyboardist Brent Mydland, who is credited with bringing a bold energy to the band’s then already classic songs, including “Eyes of The World,” “The Wheel,” and “Truckin’.”\n\nPre-order In And Out Of The Garden: Madison Square Garden ’81, ’82, ’83 here.\n\nListen to “Feel Like A Stranger” Live from MSG on 3/9/81 below."
