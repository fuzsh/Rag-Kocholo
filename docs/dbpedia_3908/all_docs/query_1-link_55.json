        "text": "Throughout his ongoing Got Back tour, Paul McCartney has reliably opened with \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nIt's not the Beatles' deepest song, nor their most beloved hit — though a hit it was. But its zippy, rollicking exuberance still shines brightly; like the rest of the oldies on his setlist, the 82-year-old launches into it in its original key. For two minutes and change, we're plunged back into 1964 — and all the humor, melody, friendship and fun the Beatles bestowed with A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThis week in 1964 — at the zenith of Beatlemania, after their seismic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" — the planet received Richard Lester's silly, surreal and innovative film of that name. Days after, its classic soundtrack dropped — a volley of uber-catchy bangers and philosophical ballads, and the only Beatles LP to solely feature Lennon-McCartney songs.\n\nAs with almost everything Beatles, the impact of the film and album have been etched in stone. But considering the breadth of pop culture history in its wake, Fab disciples can always use a reminder. Here are six things that wouldn't be the same without A Hard Day's Night.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nExplore The World Of The Beatles\n\nWhether it be \"Band on the Run\" or \"Jet\" or \"My Love,\" chances are you've heard a Wings song at least once — in all their polished, '70s-arena-sized glory. More than four decades after they disbanded in 1981, we're getting a helping of raw, uncut Wings.\n\nLast February, Wings' classic 1973 album Band on the Run got the 50th anniversary treatment, with a disc of \"underdubbed\" remixes, allowing Paul McCartney, spouse and keyboardist Linda McCartney, and guitarist Denny Laine to be heard stripped back, with added clarity.\n\nAfter a few months to digest that, it was time to reveal a session that, for ages, fans had been clamoring for. On June 14, in came One Hand Clapping, a live-in-the-studio set from August 1974 that captured Wings at the zenith of their powers.\n\nBack then, Wings had the wind in their sails, with a reconstituted lineup Band on the Run at the top of the charts. They opted to plug in at Abbey Road Studios with cameras rolling, and record a live studio album with an attendant documentary. The film wouldn’t come out until a 2010 reissue of Band on the Run; the music’s popped up on bootlegs, but had never been released in full.\n\nThat long absence is a shame; while One Hand Clapping is a bit of a historical footnote, it absolutely rips; Giles Martin shining up the mixes certainly helped. Epochal Macca ballads, like \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" and \"Blackbird,\" are well represented, but when Wings rock out, as on \"Jet,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" and \"deep cut \"Soily,\" they tear the roof off.\n\nBasically, in range and sequencing, One Hand Clapping shows McCartney prepping Wings like a rocket; soon, it'd rip through the live circuit. If you've never taken a spin through McCartney's post-Fabs discography, though, you may not know where to go from here.\n\nSo, for neophytes (or just fans wanting a refresher), here's a framework through which to sift through the Wings discography — with One Hand Clapping still ringing in your ears.\n\nThe Essentials\n\nRemember, as you get into Wings: don't cordon off their catalog from McCartney's solo work as a whole. In other words: if you haven't heard masterpieces like 1971's Ram yet, don't go scrounging through Back to the Egg deep cuts yet: check all that stuff out, then return to this list.\n\nThat being established: the proper Wings entryway is almost unquestionably Band on the Run. Like Sgt. Pepper's and Abbey Road before it, it's an exhilarating melodic and stylistic rush, a sonic adventure — whether you go for the original or the \"underdubbed\" version.\n\nIn the grand scheme of solo Beatles, Band on the Run is also the one McCartney album that slugs it out with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, in terms of artistic realization.\n\nThat being said: despite slightly inferior contemporaneous reviews, its follow-up, 1975's Venus and Mars, is almost as good — and if grandiosity isn't your bag, you might actually enjoy it more than Band on the Run. (Think of Harrison following up All Things with the sparser, more spacious Living in the Material World, and you'll get the picture.)\n\nBetween those two albums, you've got a wealth of indispensable Macca songs — \"Jet,\" \"Let Me Roll It,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" \"Rock Show,\" \"You Gave Me the Answer\" — as well as satisfying deep cuts, like doomed Wingsman Jimmy McCulloch's \"Medicine Jar.\"\n\nFrom there, it's time to understand Weird Wings — which rewinds the clock to their beginnings.\n\nThe Weirdness\n\nAs the McCartney canon goes, Ram's stock seems to shoot up every year, single handedly inspiring new generations of psych-pop weirdos. By comparison, Wings' debut, Wild Life, was critically savaged in 1971, and its reputation isn't much better today.\n\nAs you'll learn so often in your solo Macca voyage — you've just got to ignore the critics sometimes. Even McCartney himself said \"Bip Bop\" \"just goes nowhere\" and \"I cringe every time I hear it.\" What he leaves out it's a maddening earworm — to hear this loony, circuitous little sketch once is to carry it to your deathbed.\n\nIndeed, Wild Life is full of moments that will stick with you. In the title track, McCartney screams about the zoo like his hair's on fire; \"I Am Your Singer\" is a swaying dialogue between Paul and Linda; \"Dear Friend\" is one of McCartney's most moving songs about Lennon.\n\nWild Life's follow-up, Red Rose Speedway, is a little more candy-coated and commercial — but outside of the polarizing hit \"My Love,\" it has some integral McCartney tunes, like \"Little Lamb Dragonfly\" and \"Single Pigeon.\"\n\nIn the end, though, Wild Life is arguably the early Wings offering that will really stick to your ribs. It's not a crummy follow-up to Ram, but an intriguing off-ramp from its harebrained universe — and as the opening statement from McCartney's post-Beatles vehicle, worth investigating just on that merit.\n\nThe Deep Cuts\n\nMcCartney has always been a hit-or-miss solo artist by design — digging through the half-written pastiches and questionable experiments is part of the deal.\n\n1976's Wings at the Speed of Sound features a key track in the irrepressibly jaunty \"Let 'Em In,\" and an (in)famous disco-spangled hit in \"Silly Love Songs.\" From there, with tunes like \"Cook of the House\" and \"Warm and Beautiful,\" your mileage may vary wildly.\n\nThe ratio holds for 1978's London Town: you could put the gorgeous \"I'm Carrying\" on your playlist and scrap the rest, or you can go spelunking. And McCartney being McCartney, despite 1979's Back to the Egg being choppy waters, he nailed it at least once — on the lithe, sophisticated, Stevie Wonder-like \"Arrow Through Me.\"\n\nToday, at 81, McCartney is an 18-time GRAMMY winner and an enormous concert draw — charging through his six-decade catalog in stadiums the world over. These albums only comprise one decade in his history, where he flourished as a mulleted stadium act alongside his keyboarding wife. But his catalog would be so much different if he never got his Wings.\n\n5 Lesser Known Facts About The Beatles' Let It Be Era: Watch The Restored 1970 Film\n\nWhat is about the Beatles' Let it Be sessions that continues to bedevil diehards?\n\nEven after their aperture was tremendously widened with Get Back — Peter Jackson's three-part, almost eight hour, 2021 doc — something's always been missing. Because it was meant as a corrective to a film that, well, most of us haven't seen in a long time — if at all.\n\nThat's Let it Be, the original 1970 documentary on those contested, pivotal, hot-and-cold sessions, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Much of the calcified lore around the Beatles' last stand comes not from the film itself, but what we think is in the film.\n\nLet it Be does contain a couple of emotionally charged moments between maturing Beatles. The most famous one: George Harrison getting snippy with Paul McCartney over a guitar part, which might just be the most blown-out-of-proportion squabble in rock history.\n\nBut superfans smelled blood in the water: the film had to be a locus for the Beatles' untimely demise. To which the film's director, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, might say: did we see the same movie?\n\n\"Looking back from history's vantage point, it seems like everybody drank the bad batch of Kool-Aid,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. Lindsay-Hogg had just appeared at an NYC screening, and seemed as surprised by it as the fans: \"Because the opinion that was first formed about the movie, you could not form on the actual movie we saw the other night.\"\n\nHe's correct. If you saw Get Back, Lindsay-Hogg is the babyfaced, cigar-puffing auteur seen throughout; today, at 84, his original vision has been reclaimed. On May 8, Disney+ unveiled a restored and refreshed version of the Let it Be film — a historical counterweight to Get Back. Temperamentally, though, it's right on the same wavelength, which is bound to surprise some Fabs disciples.\n\nWith the benefit of Peter Jackson's sound-polishing magic and Giles Martin's inspired remixes of performances, Let it Be offers a quieter, more muted, more atmospheric take on these sessions. (Think fewer goofy antics, and more tight, lingering shots of four of rock's most evocative faces.)\n\nAs you absorb the long-on-ice Let it Be, here are some lesser-known facts about this film, and the era of the Beatles it captures — with a little help from Lindsay-Hogg himself.\n\nThe Beatles Were Happy With The Let It Be Film\n\nAfter Lindsay-Hogg showed the Beatles the final rough cut, he says they all went out to a jovial meal and drinks: \"Nice food, collegial, pleasant, witty conversation, nice wine.\"\n\nAfterward, they went downstairs to a discotheque for nightcaps. \"Paul said he thought Let it Be was good. We'd all done a good job,\" Lindsay-Hogg remembers. \"And Ringo and [wife] Maureen were jiving to the music until two in the morning.\"\n\n\"They had a really, really good time,\" he adds. \"And you can see like [in the film], on their faces, their interactions — it was like it always was.\"\n\nAbout \"That\" Fight: Neither Paul Nor George Made A Big Deal\n\nAt this point, Beatles fanatics can recite this Harrison-in-a-snit quote to McCartney: \"I'll play, you know, whatever you want me to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you… I'll do it.\" (Yes, that's widely viewed among fans as a tremendous deal.)\n\nIf this was such a fissure, why did McCartney and Harrison allow it in the film? After all, they had say in the final cut, like the other Beatles.\n\n\"Nothing was going to be in the picture that they didn't want,\" Lindsay-Hogg asserts. \"They never commented on that. They took that exchange as like many other exchanges they'd had over the years… but, of course, since they'd broken up a month before [the film's release], everyone was looking for little bits of sharp metal on the sand to think why they'd broken up.\"\n\nRecently, Ringo Starr opined that there was \"not a lot of joy\" in the Let it Be film; Lindsay-Hogg says Starr framed it to him as \"no joy.\"\n\nOf course, that's Starr's prerogative. But it's not quite borne out by what we see — especially that merry scene where he and Harrison work out an early draft of Abbey Road's \"Octopus's Garden.\"\n\n\"And Ringo's a combination of so pleased to be working on the song, pleased to be working with his friend, glad for the input,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. \"He's a wonderful guy. I mean, he can think what he wants and I will always have greater affection for him.\n\n\"Let's see if he changes his mind by the time he's 100,\" he added mirthfully.\n\nLindsay-Hogg Thought It'd Never Be Released Again\n\n\"I went through many years of thinking, It's not going to come out,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. In this regard, he characterizes 25 or 30 years of his life as \"solitary confinement,\" although he was \"pushing for it, and educating for it.\"\n\n\"Then, suddenly, the sun comes out\" — which may be thanks to Peter Jackson, and renewed interest via Get Back. \"And someone opens the cell door, and Let it Be walks out.\"\n\nNobody Asked Him What The Sessions Were Like\n\nAll four Beatles, and many of their associates, have spoken their piece on Let it Be sessions — and journalists, authors, documentarians, and fans all have their own slant on them.\n\nBut what was this time like from Lindsay-Hogg's perspective? Incredibly, nobody ever thought to check. \"You asked the one question which no one has asked,\" he says. \"No one.\"\n\nSo, give us the vibe check. Were the Let it Be sessions ever remotely as tense as they've been described, since man landed on the moon? And to that, Lindsay-Hogg's response is a chuckle, and a resounding, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nThe Beatles' Final Song: Giles Martin On The Second Life Of \"Now And Then\" & How The Fab Four Are \"Still Breaking New Ground\"\n\nAs expected, much buzz followed the release of Taylor Swift's 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19. Fans and critics alike have devoured the sprawling double album’s 31 tracks, unpacking her reflections from \"a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time\" in search of Easter eggs, their new favorite lyrics and references to famous faces (both within the pop supernova’s closely guarded orbit and the historical record).\n\nShoutouts abound in The Tortured Poets Department: Charlie Puth gets his much-deserved (and Taylor-approved) flowers on the title track, while 1920s screen siren Clara Bow, the ancient Greek prophetess Cassandra and Peter Pan each get a song titled after them. Post Malone and Florence + the Machine’s Florence Welch each tap in for memorable duets. Relationships old (Joe Alwyn), new (Travis Kelce) and somewhere in between (1975’s Matty Healy) are alluded to without naming names, as is, possibly, the singer’s reputation-era feud with Kim Kardashian.\n\nSwift casts a wide net on The Tortured Poets Department, encompassing popular music, literature, mythology and beyond, but it's far from the first time the 14-time GRAMMY winner has worn her influences on her sleeve. While you digest TTPD, consider these 10 figures who have influenced the poet of the hour — from Stevie Nicks and Patti Smith to Emily Dickinson, William Wordsworth, Arya Stark and more.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nIf Taylor Swift is the chairman of The Tortured Poets Department, Stevie Nicks may as well be considered its poet laureate emeritus. The mystical Fleetwood Mac frontwoman earns an important mention on side A closer \"Clara Bow,\" in which Swift ties an invisible string from herself to a pre-Rumours Nicks (\"In ‘75, the hair and lips/ Crowd goes wild at her fingertips\"), and all the way back to the 1920s It Girl of the song’s title.\n\nFor her part, Nicks seems to approve of her place in Swift’s cultural lineage, considering she penned the poem found inside physical copies of The Tortured Poets Department. \"He was in love with her/ Or at least she thought so,\" the Priestess of Rock and Roll wrote in part, before signing off, \"For T — and me…\"\n\nSwift’s relationship with Nicks dates back to the 2010 GRAMMYs, when the pair performed a medley of \"Rhiannon\" and \"You Belong With Me\" before the then-country upstart took home her first Album Of The Year win for 2009’s Fearless. More recently, the \"Edge of Seventeen\" singer publicly credited Swift’s Midnights cut \"You’re On Your Own, Kid\" for helping her through the 2022 death of Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie.\n\nPatti Smith\n\nSwift may see herself as more \"modern idiot\" than modern-day Patti Smith, but that didn’t stop the superstar from name-dropping the icon synonymous with the Hotel Chelsea and punk scene of ‘70s New York on a key track on The Tortured Poets Department. Swift rather self-deprecatingly compares herself to the celebrated Just Kids memoirist (and 2023 Songwriters Hall of Fame nominee) on the double album’s synth-drenched title track, and it’s easy to see how Smith’s lifelong fusion of rock and poetry influenced the younger singer’s dactylic approach to her new album.\n\nSmith seemed to appreciate the shout-out on \"The Tortured Poets Department\" as well. \"This is saying I was moved to be mentioned in the company of the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Thank you Taylor,\" she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of herself reading Thomas’ 1940 poetry collection Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog.\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nWhen it comes to iconic poets, Swift has also taken a page or two over her career from Emily Dickinson. While the great 19th century poet hasn’t come up explicitly in Swift’s work, she did reference her poetic forebear (and actual sixth cousin, three times removed!) in her speech while accepting the award for Songwriter-Artist of the Decade at the 2022 Nashville Songwriter Awards.\n\n\"I’ve never talked about this publicly before, because, well, it’s dorky. But I also have, in my mind, secretly, established genre categories for lyrics I write. Three of them, to be exact. They are affectionately titled Quill Lyrics, Fountain Pen Lyrics and Glitter Gel Pen Lyrics,\" Swift told the audience before going on to explain, \"If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre,\" she went on to explain.\n\nEven before this glimpse into Swift’s writing process, Easter eggs had been laid pointing to her familial connection to Dickinson. For example, she announced her ninth album evermore on December 10, 2020, which would have been the late poet’s 190th birthday. Another clue that has Swifties convinced? Dickinson’s use of the word \"forevermore\" in her 1858 poem \"One Sister Have I in Our House,\" which Swift also cleverly breaks apart in Evermore’s Bon Iver-assisted title track (\"And I couldn’t be sure/ I had a feeling so peculiar/ That this pain would be for/ Evermore\").\n\nThe Lake Poets\n\nSwift first put her growing affinity for poetry on display during her folklore era with \"the lakes.\" On the elegiac bonus track, the singer draws a parallel with the Lake Poets of the 19th century, wishing she could escape to \"the lakes where all the poets went to die\" with her beloved muse in tow. In between fantasizing about \"those Windermere peaks\" and pining for \"auroras and sad prose,\" she even manages to land a not-so-subtle jab at nemesis Scooter Braun (\"I’ve come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze/ Tell me what are my words worth\") that doubles as clever wordplay on the last name of Lake Poet School members William and Dorothy Wordsworth.\n\nSwift revealed more about why she connected to the Lake Poets in her 2020 Disney+ documentary folklore: the long pond studio sessions. \"There was a poet district, these artists that moved there. And they were kind of heckled for it and made fun of for it as being these eccentrics and these kind of odd artists who decided that they just wanted to live there,\" she explained to her trusted producer Jack Antonoff. \"So ‘the lakes,’ it kind of is the overarching theme of the whole album: of trying to escape, having something you wanna protect, trying to protect your own sanity and saying, ‘Look, they did this hundreds of years ago. I’m not the first person who’s felt this way.’\"\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney and Swift have publicly praised one another’s work for years, leading to the 2020 Rolling Stone cover they posed for together for the special Musicians on Musicians issue. The younger singer even counts Sir Paul’s daughter Stella McCartney as a close friend and collaborator (Stella designed a capsule collection for Swift’s 2019 studio set Lover and earned a shout-out of her own on album cut \"London Boy\").\n\nHowever, Swift took her relationship with the Beatles founder and his family a step further when it was rumored she based Midnights deep cut \"Sweet Nothing\" on McCartney’s decades-long romance with late wife Linda. While the speculation has never been outright confirmed, it appears Swift’s lyrics in the lilting love song (\"On the way home, I wrote a poem/ You say, ‘What a mind’/ This happens all the time\") were partially inspired by a strikingly similar quote McCartney once gave about his relationship with Linda, who passed away in 1998. To add to the mystique, the Midnights singer even reportedly liked a tweet from 2022 espousing the theory.\n\nThe admiration between the duo seems to go both ways as well, with the former Beatle admitting in a 2018 BBC profile that the track \"Who Cares\" from his album Egypt Station was inspired by Swift’s close relationship with her fans.\n\nThe Chicks\n\nFrom her days as a country music ingénue to her ascendance as the reigning mastermind of pop, Swift has credited the Chicks as a seminal influence in her songwriting and career trajectory. (Need examples? Look anywhere from early singles like \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should’ve Said No\" to Evermore’s Haim-assisted murder ballad \"no body, no crime\" and her own Lover-era collab with the band, \"Soon You’ll Get Better.\")\n\nIn a 2020 Billboard cover story tied to the Chicks’ eighth album Gaslighter, Swift acknowledged just how much impact the trio made on her growing up. \"Early in my life, these three women showed me that female artists can play their own instruments while also putting on a flamboyant spectacle of a live show,\" she said at the time. \"They taught me that creativity, eccentricity, unapologetic boldness and kitsch can all go together authentically. Most importantly, they showed an entire generation of girls that female rage can be a bonding experience between us all the very second we first heard Natalie Maines bellow ‘that Earl had to DIE.’\"\n\n\"Game of Thrones\"\n\nWhen reputation dropped in 2017, Swift was on a self-imposed media blackout, which meant no cover stories or dishy sit-down interviews on late-night TV during the album’s roll-out. Instead, the singer let reputation speak for itself, and fans were largely left to draw their own conclusions about their queen’s wildly anticipated comeback album. Two years later, though, Swift revealed the dark, vengeful, romantic body of work was largely inspired by \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n\"These songs were half based on what I was going through, but seeing them through a 'Game of Thrones' filter,\" she told Entertainment Weekly in 2019. \"My entire outlook on storytelling has been shaped by [\"GoT\"] — the ability to foreshadow stories, to meticulously craft cryptic story lines. So, I found ways to get more cryptic with information and still be able to share messages with the fans. I aspire to be one one-millionth of the kind of hint dropper the makers of 'Game of Thrones' have been.\"\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nSwift has long made her admiration of Joni Mitchell known, dating back to her 2012 album Red, which took a cue from the folk pioneer’s landmark 1971 LP Blue for its chromatic title. In an interview around the time of Red’s release, the country-pop titan gushed over Blue’s impact on her, telling Rhapsody, \"[Mitchell] wrote it about her deepest pains and most haunting demons. Songs like ‘River,’ which is just about her regrets and doubts of herself — I think this album is my favorite because it explores somebody’s soul so deeply.\"\n\nBack in 2015, TIME declared the \"Blank Space\" singer a \"disciple of Mitchell in ways both obvious and subtle\" — from her reflective songwriting to the complete ownership over her creative process, and nearly 10 years later, Swift was still showing her appreciation for Mitchell after the latter’s triumphant and emotional appearance on the GRAMMY stage to perform \"Both Sides Now\" on the very same night Taylor took home her historic fourth GRAMMY for Album Of The Year for Midnights.\n\nFall Out Boy & Paramore\n\nWhen releasing the re-recording of her third album Speak Now in 2023, Swift cited two unexpectedly emo acts as inspirations to her early songwriting: Fall Out Boy and Paramore.\n\n\"Since Speak Now was all about my songwriting, I decided to go to the artists who I feel influenced me most powerfully as a lyricist at that time and ask them to sing on the album,\" she wrote in an Instagram post revealing the back cover and complete tracklist for Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), which included Fall Out Boy collaboration \"Electric Touch\" and \"Castles Crumbling\" featuring Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams.\n\nTim McGraw\n\nFor one of Swift’s original career inspirations, we have to go all the way back to the very first single she ever released. \"Tim McGraw\" was not only as the lead single off the 16-year-old self-titled 2006 debut album, but it also paid reverent homage to one of the greatest living legends in the history of country music.\n\nIn retrospect, it was an incredibly gutsy risk for a then-unknown Swift to come raring out of the gate with a song named after a country superstar. But the gamble clearly paid off in spades, considering that now, when an entire generation of music fans hear \"Tim McGraw,\" they think of Taylor Swift.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' Is A Post-Mortem Autopsy In Song: 5 Takeaways From Her New Album"
