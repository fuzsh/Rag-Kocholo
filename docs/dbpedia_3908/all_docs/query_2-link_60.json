        "text": "I love music, all kinds of music. I love it when you can feel the passion in the performance. I love making music, I've been a musician since grade school. I love songwriting and I love to record.\n\nAs the engineer at Luna Recording Studio I love to help people realize their dreams. I record Flamenco, Classical, Hip Hop, Classic Rock, Country, Metal and EDM. Come in and have a listen and we can talk about what you need to get done. If you sound good, I sound good.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nWe sometimes like to use the catch phrase,”If it goes on a CD, we do it”. We can take a lyric and a melody and put these to music, usually within a few hours. This includes a basic beat (Drum Machine), guitar and bass. Now you can record the vocals and work on the arrangement.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIf you are in a band, or a singer songwriter and are looking to record a CD of original songs we can help you realize your full potential. To do that we need to know more about you and your project. Use the quick contact form below or click the button below for the long form."
