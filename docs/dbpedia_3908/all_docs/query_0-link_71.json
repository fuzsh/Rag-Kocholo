        "text": "Electrical Audio is a two-studio complex located in Chicago, Illinois and owned by Steve Albini.\n\nStudio A is the larger, more comprehensive, and fancier of our two studios. Studio A has three performance spaces, and a large control room featuring a 48-channel Neotek Elite console and extensive analog outboard, as well as regularly-serviced Studer and Ampex ATR tape machines and a Pro Tools HDX rig with Apogee Symphony mkII converters. Studio A has its own lounge, kitchenette, sink and toilets, and a separate entrance door providing privacy and self-sufficency.\n\nStudio B is the smaller and less expensive of our studios. By most standards it is still quite large, with an 800-square foot live room (with 30 foot ceiling) and a 300-square foot isolation room. The control room is also 300 square feet. There is a small, uncomfortable booth as well.\n\nIn addition to music recording and mixing, we offer analog tape-to-digital transfers at competitive rates, and can bake and restore tapes to facilitate proper transfer."
