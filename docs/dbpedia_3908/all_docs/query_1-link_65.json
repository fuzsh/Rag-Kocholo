        "text": "Baldwin’s Melanie Martinez, who won the BHS talent show as a sophomore last year, will be appearing on the second season of MSG Varsity television’s “MSG Varsity’s Talent Show” on April 22 at 8 p.m. Martinez is entered in the individual vocalist category, and will perform the song “Money (That’s What I Want)” while accompanying herself on guitar.\n\nMelanie, who will turn 17 next week, enjoys photography and playing the ukulele in addition to singing. She taped her performance on March 21 at SUNY Old Westbury’s Maguire Theater. Her performance will air against those of students from Commack High School, Yorktown High School in Westchester and Howell High School in New Jersey.\n\n“MSG Varsity’s Talent Show” will feature performances in three categories — individual vocalist, vocal ensemble and dance ensemble. Fans of Melanie can go online to www.msgvarsitytalentshow.com and vote for her. If she receives the most online votes, she will qualify for the final round of the competition on June 3. The winner will also be awarded a two-day studio session with a professional producer, record a demo CD or a music video and be the focus of a professional photo shoot.\n\nThe host of the show, Jared Cotter — a veteran of “American Idol” — says he has been amazed at the skill of the performers on season two of “Varsity Talent Show.” “I’m really impressed with the caliber of the performances delivered by these high schoolers,” Cotter said. “I only wish they had this when I was in high school.”"
