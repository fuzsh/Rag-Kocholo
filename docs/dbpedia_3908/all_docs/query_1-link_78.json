        "text": "Michael Schenker has completed the recording of a brand new MSG album, \"Immortal\", which is set to be released via Nuclear Blast on January 29th, 2021. The album title is a perfect statement describing Michael Schenker's legacy and to celebrate his 50th anniversary as a musician. Today, the band has released a lyric video for their first single 'Drilled To Kill'; a heavy up-tempo track which is also the opening song on the album. The track features the legendary PRIMAL FEAR singer Ralf Scheepers on vocals, whilst Michael Schenker and keyboardist Derek Sherinian (BLACK COUNTRY COMMUNION etc.) engage in an exciting battle of guitar vs. keyboard. Watch the video for 'Drilled To Kill' here: https://youtu.be/bcrU9ZS6CZA Get the single digitally here: http://nblast.de/MSG-Immortal-DSP Today, MSG also kick off the pre-order for \"Immortal\", which will be available in the following formats: CD CD/Blu-ray Digipak (incl. „Michael Schenker Fest Live @ Bang Your Head festival) Earbook (incl. album CD + live Blu-ray & live 2CD) PIC-LP LP (black, black/white marbled, red/black marbled) Pre-order the album here: http://nblast.de/MSG-Immortal The tracklist reads as follows: 01. Drilled To Kill 02. Don´t Die On Me Now 03. Knight Of The Dead 04. After The Rain 05. Devil's Daughter 06. Sail The Darkness 07. The Queen Of Thorns And Roses 08. Come On Over 09. Sangria Morte 10. In Search Of The Peace Of Mind The album was predominantly recorded at the Kidroom Studio in Germany, with Michael's long time partner Michael Voss who co-produced the album and also sings on two tracks. The cover artwork of „Immortal“ was created by Zsofia Dankova (POWERWOLF etc.). „Immortal“ will continue the tradition of the previous two MICHAEL SCHENKER FEST records „Resurrection“ and „Revelation“ featuring a big list of friends and guests. The album's main vocalist will be uprising Chilean born talent Ronnie Romero (RAINBOW etc.), along with Michael Voss (MAD MAX etc.), Ralf Scheepers (PRIMAL FEAR) and Joe Lynn Turner (ex-DEEP PURPLE, RAINBOW etc.) singing on two tracks each. Besides Michael Schenker himself, the album was recorded with Steve Mann (keyboards), Barry Sparks (bass, DOKKEN etc.), as well as the three drummers Bodo Schopf, Simon Philipps (ex-TOTO) and Brian Tichy (ex-WHITESNAKE). The newest addition to the record is keyboard player Derek Sherinian (ex-DREAM THEATER, ex-KISS etc.), who plays on the album's opening track, featuring German power machine Ralf Scheepers on vocals. „Immortal“ will feature ten tracks, including the magnum opus \"In Search Of The Peace Of Mind\". „I wrote this song when I was 15 years old, it was my first ever written piece of music which I recorded with SCORPIONS on our first studio album „Lonesome Crow“ in 1970, getting released in 1972. We re-recorded this song for my 50th anniversary as a celebration and it turned out to be an epic; with an extra extension at the end of the song, which turned out absolutely fantastic with Simon Phillips on drums, doing his usual amazing stuff.“ The result is a true highlight and features even more surprises: „Gary Barden sings the first verse, continued by Ronnie Romero - and in the end we have Ronnie, Doogie White and Robin McAuley screaming their heads off, as a tribute to my 50th anniversary. Absolute amazing. Thanks to the guys for doing this!“ The limited first edition of this upcoming MSG album will feature another unique extra: „It will include the MICHAEL SCHENK"
