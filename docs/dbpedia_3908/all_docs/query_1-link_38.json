        "text": "This video was shot during the rehearsal and recording of MSG's next album \"THE UNFORGIVEN\". Since this is not a pro-shot video, you cannot expect too much. HOWEVER,\n\n1. You can see how they rehearse and record the album, which is rare to see. Michael rehearses in a very relaxed way. Everybody in the band looks quite fitted in with each other.\n\n2. You can hear lots of Michael's outtakes and alternative lead plays, all of which are cool.\n\n3. Also, you can guess how good the album will be. It will be heavier than the previous studio album \"Written In The Sand\". My first impression is that this album is based on Michael's great riffs. Of course his solo is great, but he is the king of riffs. It seems that Kelly Keeling is a David Coverdale-kind-of classical singer with straight shouting vocal. I feel he suits MSG.\n\n4. Additionally, you can see private shots of Michael and Linda loving each other. As you can see from the video package, Michael's hair is back to short and original blond which I love. He signed the cover in front of me on January 12, 1999. He looks cool and fine.\n\nLet us look forward to the release of The Unforgiven! --- (added 01/16/1999)"
