Normally an artist will speak into a microphone that converts the sound into electrical energy which is received and also sent back to the artist via the headphones worn. The acoustic instrument we have records the sound from the microphone while we listen to the sound and evaluate the output for quality.\n\nHow Much Is a Studio Session?\n\nStudio session prices start at $70.00 per hour without an engineer. Studios in Miami often have different recording rooms, each with its own rates. House of Hits offers four unique suite options that provide an experience! An individual that considers working 8+ hours or more may be eligible for a discount on their studio time, feel free to get in touch with us if for additional information.\n\nHow Is Your Recording Studio Built?\n\nOur recording studio is built to standard with good acoustic treatment. Different materials were utilized to either reflect or absorb sound in the studio. So basically, the physical structure is also designed to give a recording artist the best possible outcome from his studio time.\n\nWhy Should I Consider Using a Professional Recording Studio?\n\nThere are different reasons why you need a professional studio just like ours. We have the right physical structure that supports good acoustics, top-notch equipment, and an experienced engineer to help you get the best possible recording outcome.\n\nHow Do You Guys Make Money?\n\nOur pricing is used for both individual artists, bands, and corporate entities. So we get involved in the recording of different contents for different brands and individuals. Some of our clients consider us as the best recording studio in Miami, so we find it reasonable to attend to clients with various purposes of engaging in music production and sound recording.\n\nHow Do I Know When to Visit the Studio for a Recording Session?\n\nEvery studio session is by appointment. Usually, when you contact us and make demands on the number of hours you need, we will arrange for a time that is convenient for both parties. Once that is done, you will be able to have your session at the appointed time. Also, please note that it is important to be at the studio location a few minutes before the appointed time for recording.\n\nDo You Have a Recording Staff, or Is it Self-Service?\n\nYes, one or more recording staff will be present to assist you to enjoy your recording in Miami. Some other activities that our staff can handle include; mastering and mixing the audio, recording a video, especially for those that want to capture the moment spent exploring the recording equipment.\n\nWhat Is the Task of a Recording Studio Engineer?\n\nThe person that handles the task of evaluating your recording for quality is the studio engineer, also known as the audio engineer. The studio engineer also works closely with the artist to select the best possible outcome from a recording session. The studio engineer will most likely work with you to select the best out of 3 different recordings.\n\nShould I Expect My Label to Handle the Cost of Studio Sessions?\n\nLabels are more interested in recordings that go viral, and not the recordings you are still working on. This means it is important to prepare for handling the cost of all studio recordings.\n\nChoose the House of Hits for Your Music Recording Needs\n\nWant to book your next recording session in one of our Miami recording studio rooms?
