        "text": "Michael Schenker will release his new MSG album, Immortal, on January 29th, 2021 via Nuclear Blast. The album title is a perfect statement describing Michael Schenker’s legacy and to celebrate his 50th anniversary as a musician.\n\nToday, the band reveal their third album trailer, in which Michael Voss explains, how their second single, the power ballad “After The Rain” was written and where the idea for the song came from.\n\nWatch the clip here:\n\nAlso, watch the music video for “After The Rain” here: https://youtu.be/kLMn1nPqANM\n\nGet the single digitally, here: http://nblast.de/MSG-Immortal-DSP\n\n“The song ‘After The Rain’ was coming out of the blue. A power ballad I have never done before. Michael Voss wrote some lyrics and vocal melodies, after I had put down my musically composition on backing track for this song. The next morning Michael Voss played me what he had sang to it and I said: This is so beautiful, only you can sing this song and it turned out amazing“, comments Michael Schenker.\n\n“This is an outstanding mellow tuned power ballad with some unique Michael Schenker clean picking guitar style. When I first listened to Michaels rough sketches, I was singing a kinda ‚lala‘ melody that automatically drove me into the line ‚say have you been lonely,…‘ – from there I felt it must deal about a sad loss and a departure of a big love… but there will be sun and light… after the rain“, adds Michael Voss.\n\n—-\n\nMichael Schenker\n\n“50th Anniversary – IMMORTAL”\n\nperformed by the current MSG/Michael Schenker Group\n\nwith special guest DORO\n\n28.10.2021 UK – Leeds, O2 Academy\n\n29.10.2021 UK – Newcastle, O2 City Hall\n\n30.10.2021 UK – Wolverhampton, KK Steel Mill\n\n31.10.2021 UK – London, O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire\n\nTickets: https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/michael-schenker-tickets/artist/890401\n\nMichael Schenker\n\n“50th Anniversary – IMMORTAL”\n\nperformed by the current MSG/Michael Schenker Group\n\n02.11.2021 NL – Zoetermeer, De Boerderij\n\n03.11.2021 CH – Pratteln, Z7\n\n04.11.2021 IT – Turin, Audiodrome\n\n05.11.2021 ES – Barcelona, Razzmatazz 1\n\n06.11.2021 ES – Madrid, La Riviera\n\nTickets: https://www.dragon-productions.eu/bands/michael-schenker/\n\n—-\n\n“Immortal” will be available in the following formats:\n\nCD\n\nCD/Blu-ray Digipak (incl. „Michael Schenker Fest Live @ Bang Your Head festival)\n\nEarbook (incl. album CD + live Blu-ray & live 2CD) *SOLD OUT\n\nPIC-LP *SOLD OUT\n\nLP (black, black/white marbled, red/black marbled)\n\nPre-order the album here: http://nblast.de/MSG-Immortal\n\nICYMI:\n\n‘Drilled To Kill’ OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO: https://youtu.be/bcrU9ZS6CZA\n\nTrailer #1: https://youtu.be/cDQ9VICJZyc\n\nTrailer #2: https://youtu.be/gcWTT_nKp0w\n\n—-\n\nThe album was predominantly recorded at the Kidroom Studio in Germany, with Michael‘s long time partner Michael Voss who co-produced the album and also sings on two tracks. “It is always a pleasure to work with Michael Voss, who works around the clock and is a phenomenal musician and producer. He was composing the melody and lyrics for a power ballad I had written the music for, and he ended up singing along. It turned out so amazing, I did not think anyone else could have done a better job for this song. Truly great.“\n\nImmortal will continue the tradition of the previous two MICHAEL SCHENKER FEST records Resurrection and Revelation and feature a big list of friends and guests. The album’s main vocalist will be uprising Chilean born talent Ronnie Romero (RAINBOW a.o.), along with Michael Voss (MAD MAX a.o.), Ralf Scheepers(PRIMAL FEAR) and Joe Lynn Turner (ex-DEEP PURPLE, RAINBOW a.o.) singing on two tracks each. Besides Michael Schenker himself, the album was recorded with Steve Mann (keyboards), Barry Sparks (bass, DOKKEN, etc.), as well as the three drummers Bodo Schopf, Simon Philipps (ex-TOTO) and Brian Tichy (ex-WHITESNAKE). „Brian was thrilled to be part of it. He is a master of groove and ended up playing on six songs. I could not believe it: This man is something else. He is a true natural and very original. With his input, it made the album very solid and complete. So guess what – I am very happy“, smiles Michael Schenker. The newest addition to the record is keyboard player Derek Sherinian (ex-DREAM THEATER, ex-KISS, etc.), who plays on the album’s opening track, featuring German power machine Ralf Scheepers on vocals.\n\nImmortal will feature ten tracks, including the magnum opus “In Search Of The Peace Of Mind”. “I wrote this song when I was 15 years old, it was my first ever written piece of music which I recorded with SCORPIONS on our first studio album Lonesome Crow. in 1970, getting released in 1972 – when I had already left SCORPIONS to join the British rock band UFO in June of 1972 – when I was 17. We re-recorded this song for my 50th anniversary as a celebration and it turned out to be an epic; with an extra extension at the end of the song, which turned out absolutely fantastic with Simon Phillips on drums, doing his usual amazing stuff.“ The result is a true highlight and features even more surprises: “Gary Barden sings the first verse, continued by Ronnie Romero – and in the end we have Ronnie, Doogie White, and Robin McAuley screaming their heads off, as a tribute to my 50th anniversary. Absolute amazing. Thanks to the guys for doing this!“\n\nThe limited first edition of this upcoming MSG album will feature another unique extra: “We have the MICHAEL SCHENKER FEST – Bang Your Head – Blu-ray, recorded during our headline show in Balingen/Germany two years ago: Unfixed, raw, pure and great! There’s a couple of small mistakes, but because the show and recording went so well, I decided to keep it the way it went on the night. It’s live, magic and pure.“"
