        "text": "COMMON AND PETE ROCK\n\nTHE AUDITORIUM VOL. 1\n\nwords by Dan Charnas\n\nAn artist’s creative peak isn’t always located in the heat of their first years. Most true masters’ skills and vision actually strengthen with time. But hip-hop doesn’t often get a chance to witness this evolution, in part because established artists don’t always get support in a genre obsessed with the new, and sadly because too many don’t live long enough to even have a chance to receive it. Then there are the few, joyous cases where we get to see our heroes grow into their full superhero powers. That is the experience of listening to Common and Pete Rock—the legendary MC and pioneering producer—on their first full-length collaboration, The Auditorium, Vol. 1 (Loma Vista Recordings).\n\nCheck the stats: Pete Rock’s production has propelled million-selling, chart-topping, award-winning hits from Nas, Public Enemy, The Notorious B.I.G., and Kanye West to Mick Jagger, Mary J. Blige, Madonna, and Lady Gaga; and his signature style—collage compositions imbued with complex harmony and melody—makes him one of the most influential and innovative figures in the history of popular music. Multi-hyphenate rapper-actor-producer-author-activist Common has created an unparalleled body of work: 15 landmark albums, standout performances in films from “American Gangster” and “Just Wright” to “Selma” and “The Hate U Give,” and most recently on Broadway performing in “Between Riverside and Crazy” and coproducing the revival of “The Wiz.” His Primetime Emmy, three Grammys, and Oscar for Best Original Song mean that Common has now transcended his EGO and is already shopping for a T that fits.\n\nYet this producer and MC, though they traveled in the same creative circles and soul group for three decades, collaborated only two times—on a notable song they made together in 1994 and another in 1998. Given their independent, interstellar trajectories, there was no reason their paths should cross, until Common’s course was altered by the gravity of a big event: the Hip-Hop 50th Anniversary concert at Yankee Stadium in August 2023. Common was a featured performer, but his epiphany came as a fan: “I stood out in that crowd and watched for five-and-a-half hours. I’ve never done that in my life. Just to see EPMD, to see Lil Kim, to see Mobb Deep, Snoop, Ice Cube, Run DMC, Nas, Lauryn Hill, and Fat Joe. It just made me realize how much I love the art form. It made me want to rap.”\n\nThe next month, Common found himself in Pete Rock’s studio north of New York City. “We caught up with each other and I just started playing music,” says Pete. In those first moments, the two highly-favored sons of hip-hop realized they were coming from a similar place of gratitude and enthusiasm for the genre. Common recalls thinking: “We don’t have to reach to make it sound like a throwback. We don’t have to reach to try to make it sound like it’s new and young. We’ve just got to be who we are and do what we love.” Then came Common’s second, more urgent realization: “I can’t wait to leave here and go write.”\n\n“We just became glued to each other,” Pete says. “The recording process wasn’t long at all. It took about a couple of weeks to get the first five songs done. And the way we finished it was heroic.” And though Pete experienced the pace of their work as brisk, Common remembers the time as one of intense deliberation. “It took time for Pete to dig into these records and find the right sample,” Common says. “Sometimes he would hook it up right then and there, but sometimes he waited ‘till he felt it was the right time and the right expression. And it’s that time, that care, that diligence that comes through in the music that we make.” Common wrote steadily, recording his vocals in the familiar sanctum of Electric Lady Studios. Several more visits, a back and forth of ideas over text and phone, and the 15 tracks of The Auditorium, Vol. 1 coalesced. “I was reaching for the euphoria of what we did in the 90s, but updated,” Pete says. “The feel of the album is 90s, but it’s not 90s at all. It’s new music.”\n\nCratedigging, making beats, writing verses—these rituals of youth were exercised with an adult’s patience and control. As they worked, Pete and Common recognized the things they do better now. Pete has become less judgmental of his own work in a way that allows him to try different sounds and structures: “Some things you may have to just get used to the more you hear it.” For Common, it’s simple: “I’m better at figuring out, ‘Okay, what will make this song a song?’ I’m better at songwriting now because I’m a better musician. And because music is not my only outlet for creating art and making a living, I’m more free and more confident. Then I can enjoy the music I’m making and do it with love.”\n\nLove is the message, from the opening fanfare of “Dreamin’” to the sunset of “Now and Then.” Pete repeats sonic feats, beat after beat: launching Curtis Mayfield’s languid, live rendition of “We’ve Only Just Begun” into a rollicking groove in “We’re On Our Way”; turning bits and bytes of Brazilian funk into jams like “Fortunate”; chopping baroque harpsichord and jazz piano into night-and-day music beds for “Stellar” and “When The Sun Shines”; casting down the words of Shan and Rakim like lightning bolts from vengeful Gods over skull-cracking drums in “Wise Up” and “All Kind of Ideas.” In an album with no skips, you can hear the vinyl crackle, but the master manipulator of music and puzzle-solver of sampling is mos def hi-def, not “lo-fi,” whatever that is.\n\nThe great joy of listening to Common rhyme has always been that you get to watch his mind work, while he makes that work look like play. His lyrical leaps and complex connections could yield flowcharts and Venn diagrams. Listen for the opening lines of “Chi Town Do It,” a chance meeting that becomes a nest of nested references. Listen to how Common cruises through the alphabet in the second verse of “This Man’s Arms” (“E’ase up, I don’t F with em cause it’s G’s up”), and then in the third recounts a performance early in his career, downloading “hard Drives on Lakeshore” for a grateful audience while he struggles to “to pay for the rent and the parking tickets/while they pay for tickets.” Listen for his description of the three wise men in “Wise Up” a few lines before he calls himself the “Solomon of Common men.” Pay attention to the sequence of double meaning in “Stellar” (meteor and planet, planet and rock, rock and Gibraltar) and the triple entendre of “pipes” in “When The Sun Shines Again.” This man—who is at this point “fucking with three decades” in his career “like an orgy”—is not playing with you. Only someone who’s read a million movie scripts could open a song with “Rack focus to the Black Moses.” His own favorite moment in an album of favored moments is the first verse of “Now and Then,” wherein he speaks of Gods and Resurrections, and of “learning like Sha’Carri/Long nails in our bodies, they try to crucify us/Don’t know if Lake Michigan can purify us.” Common adds: “It’s fun, but it’s spiritual. It’s got layers to it.”\n\nCommon is not only the prodigious free-association poet, but consistently the intrepid explorer of his own emotional world. On that note, Common delivers a piece of work nothing short of a startling with “Lonesome,” which begins with some self-reflection that’s better than tea from any tabloid or TMZ (“Every love I’m in/My endless love always comes to an end”) but ends as a conversation with his adult daughter, Omoye, now a lawyer, about encountering her own challenges as she moves through life. “I wanted to talk to her as a young woman who needs to know that her father is there for her.” There has never been anything like it in hip-hop.\n\nThe Auditorium, Vol. 1 is the product of one producer and one MC, another rarity in today’s music marketplace where high-profile projects are usually occasion for a cavalcade of stars. Here, the few featured guests are chosen with requisite mindfulness. “I’m only going to work with people who are going to elevate the song,” says Common. To that end, superstar and fellow Chicagoan Jennifer Hudson lifts a refrain to the heavens in “There is a God”; and the chorus for “Everything Is So Grand” was written and sung by PJ, whom Common calls “one of the greatest writers I’ve ever been around.” Then there is the stealthy omnipresence of Common’s longtime collaborator Bilal, whose sonic shapeshifting powers approach the supernatural. “Bilal is one of those vocalists who can make his voice do all these different things. In ‘So Many People,’ you’d think he’s the sample.” De La Soul’s Posdnuos laid a dozen bars of gold on “When The Sun Shines Again.” And then there’s Pete’s turn on the mic in “All Kind of Ideas,” which is not so much a verse as it is a murder. After the recording, another longtime comrade came through: Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, offering helpful advice on the album sequence.\n\nBut the most important working relationship on the album was the one Common and Pete Rock forged, not a foregone conclusion for two famous figures used to calling the musical shots. “There were a couple of times when me and Common bumped heads like, ‘Yo, man, I don’t know about that one.’” They were usually small things — the timing of a particular lyric, for example. “I had to sit and live with his idea, and he had to sit and live with my idea. And then we just said, ‘You know what? We’re going to work through this because what we’re doing is nothing less than great. If we disagree with each other, we’ll find a common ground.’ And I enjoyed that a lot.” Common echoes the sentiment: “It taught me a lot about being in a group in many ways because all the decisions are not just mine. I love teammates, but I had to get used to it on a musical level. Most producers that I worked with would just create the music, but it wasn’t a collaboration where it was like, ‘Okay, the we both need to like the title or the album cover.’ But Pete cares about his music a whole lot. He is strong-willed because the work needs to be at the level that he feels is right. And I’m like, I’m with that.” It is a mutual admiration, says Pete: “Lemme tell you how sharp that dude is when it come to the music and the hip-hop. He remembers lyrics, he remembers hooks, he remembers everything.”\n\nPete continues: “The understanding we had as two grown men that’s been doing this for so long was, ‘Here’s the goal where we’re trying to reach. Do you think we can reach that?’ And I’m like, ‘Of course we could do that, with your history mind and my history. That’s the least that can be accomplished.’”\n\nA victory for the art of MCing and the mad science of sampled music, The Auditorium, Vol. 1 succeeds because it accomplishes what its makers hoped for. Says Common: “I want this to be taken as a complete piece of work, a complete piece of art, and for it to exist in different time periods.”\n\nThe Auditorium, Vol. 1 is the past, present, and future happening all at once. In any decade, an absolute banger. Separate or together, they are in top form. And they’re already working on Vol. 2.\n\nSoccer Mommy\n\nSometimes, Forever, the immersive and compulsively replayable new Soccer Mommy full-length, cements Sophie Allison’s status as one of the most gifted songwriters making rock music right now. Packed with clever nods to synth-filled subgenres like new wave and goth, the album finds Sophie broadening the borders of her aesthetic without abandoning the unsparing lyricism and addictive melodies that make Soccer Mommy songs so easy to obsess over. Sometimes, Forever is the 24-year-old’s boldest and most aesthetically adventurous work, a mesmerizing collection that feels both informed by the past and explicitly of the moment. It’s a fresh peek into the mind of an artist who synthesizes everything — retro sounds, personal tumult, the relatable disorder of modern life — into original music that feels built to last a long time. Maybe even forever.\n\nSophie was only 20 when she put out Clean, her arresting studio debut, which became one of the most beloved coming-of-age albums of the 2010s. Its bigger-sounding followup, color theory, brought more acclaim and continued to win her fans far outside of the lo-fi bedroom pop scene she cut her teeth playing in. But with all the highs came inevitable lows. Navigating young adulthood is often spiritually draining, to say nothing of the artless administrative chaos associated with being a popular full-time musician. And yet she never stops writing, consistently transforming bouts of instability into emotionally generous music. The latest culmination of that process is Sometimes, Forever, which sees Sophie once again tapping into the turn-of-the-millenium sensibilities she’s known for. This time, though, she advances her self-made sonic world beyond the present and into the future with experimental-minded production, an expanded moodboard of vintage touchstones, and some of her most sophisticated songwriting to date.\n\nTo support her vision, Sophie enlisted producer Daniel Lopatin, a.k.a Oneohtrix Point Never, whose recent behind-the-boards credits include the Uncut Gems movie score and The Weeknd’s chart-topping Dawn FM. While the pairing might seem unexpected, active listening reveals a kindred creativity; both artists are interested in utilizing memory-triggering sounds and melodies to make invigorating music that transcends its influences. On Sometimes, Forever, Lopatin employs his boundless synth vocabulary and knack for meticulous arrangements to complement Sophie’s well-crafted compositions. The result is an epic-feeling mix of raw-edged live takes and studio wizardry.\n\nNowhere is Sophie’s exploration more spellbinding than “Unholy Affliction,” a first-half highlight with a paranoid post-rock rhythm and cursed-sounding synths. “I don’t want the money / That fake kind of happy,” she sings with dead-eyed disaffection. In addition to showcasing Sophie’s appreciation for textures that are at once pretty and unsettling, “Unholy Affliction” foregrounds one of Sometimes, Forever’s more compelling narrative tensions: the push and pull between Sophie’s desire to make meaningful art and her skepticism about the mechanics of careerism. “I hate so many parts of the music industry, but I also want success,” Sophie says. “And not just success — perfection. I want to make things that are flawless, that perfectly encapsulate what I’m thinking and feeling. It’s an unachievable goal that keeps you constantly chasing it.”\n\nSometimes, Forever fixates on those sorts of contradictory forces: desire and apathy, ecstasy and misery, good and evil, self-control and wildness. Straight-up love songs — like the ultra-catchy “Shotgun,” which likens romance to a chemical high without the gnarly comedown — rub up against much gloomier fare, like the Sylvia Plath-referencing “Darkness Forever,” a sludge-rock fever dream from the album’s midsection. The weightless “newdemo” spins delicately layered harmonies and mystical synths into an end-of-the-world reverie; the impending apocalypse has never sounded so jaw-droppingly beautiful. “I didn’t want to make something super depressing without any sense of magic,” Sophie explains.\n\nThe title Sometimes, Forever refers to the idea that both good and bad feelings are cyclical. “Sorrow and emptiness will pass, but they will always come back around — as will joy,” Sophie says. “At some point you’re forced to say, I’ll just have to take both.” She articulates this sentiment on the gut-punch opening of “Still,” her clear voice imbued with a heartbreaking blend of wisdom and hurt: “I don’t know how to feel things small / It’s a tidal wave or nothing at all.” Sophie understands that Sometimes, Forever is lyrically dark, with macabre imagery haunting even its most upbeat passages. But because she’s in a better place than when she wrote the songs, she has no trouble luxuriating in the moments of uncomplicated bliss that coexist alongside the bleakness.\n\nOne of those moments comes on the record’s penultimate track, “Feel It All The Time,” a song-length metaphor about a resilient old truck. “I wanna drive out where the sun shines / drown out the noise and the way I feel,” goes the hook, a heart-bursting blur of shoegaze-y Americana. By song’s end the narrator returns to a state of world-weariness, resigned to the fact that she probably can’t outrun her demons forever. But for a few flickering moments — Sophie’s voice freewheeling over warm guitar ripples, the sun-drenched sound of a generational talent at the height of her powers — it feels like maybe she could keep on driving, faster and faster until all of that existential darkness is behind her, just a cloud of red dust in a dirty rearview mirror.\n\nChelsea Wolfe\n\nShe Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She\n\nEVERYWHERE FEBRUARY 9, 2024\n\nChelsea Wolfe’s latest album, She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She, is a rebirth in process. It’s about how such a moment connects to our past, our present, and our future. It’s a powerfully cathartic statement about cutting ties, as well as an important reminder that healing is cyclical and circular, and not a simple linear process. As Wolfe explains, “It’s a record about the past self reaching out to the present self reaching out to the future self to summon change, growth, and guidance. It’s a story of setting yourself free from situations and patterns that are holding you back, in order to become self-empowered. It’s an invitation to step into your authenticity.”\n\nOn She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She, there are references to shedding exoskeletons, to excommunication, and to permanent fissures. The liminal, the in-between, and the unseen are recurring characters. As Wolfe puts it, “like the dark moon, that void space can feel unpredictable and looming, but it also holds so much potential, mystery, and excitement.” Dense and minimal, raw and opulent, intimate and expansive, the production also breaks apart then rebuilds—samples of the band are cut and pasted back together, heavy guitars dissolve into trip-hop breaks; the vocal delivery is both hushed and soaring. As Wolfe sings in the blistering opener, “Whispers In The Echo Chamber,” she’s “twisting the old self into poetry.” (The same track finds her “bathing in the blood of who [she] used to be.”)\n\nThere’s an intimate, ASMR-like quality to the vocals on this album, delicate and detailed. Nothing feels straightforward, left to chance, or as expected. Wolfe said of She Reaches Out: “This album demanded to be lived.” Throughout, these vocals hold specific keys to meaning, and feel sculptural.\n\nThe initial songwriting was kept to a core of longtime collaborators, as Wolfe worked closely with multi-instrumentalist Ben Chisholm, along with drummer Jess Gowrie and guitarist Bryan Tulao. The songs were written and workshopped remotely from the spring of 2020 through the end of 2021 by Wolfe and these collaborators. In early 2022, she brought the work she had collected to producer and TV On The Radio co-founder Dave Sitek, who worked with the band to deconstruct the compositions, pushing the songs into uncharted waters where they were then transformed and reborn. The pieces found their final focus at the mixing console of Shawn Everett (Slowdive, SZA, Alvvays, the Killers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs); Everett and Wolfe worked to extract the fine details from the vocals, blending them into the lush sonic production world. Everett mixed in a sense of urgency and excitement, while still maintaining the delicate sections of its production.\n\nThis leap into the unknown shouldn’t be surprising: Wolfe has never been afraid to experiment, traverse genre, or invent her own hybrids. If you return to her 2010 debut, The Grime and the Glow, amongst the room-tone atmospherics, punk drums, dark melody, and Wolfe’s commanding voice you can already see the prototypical skeleton, a visionary scratchpad, for what would follow. An early approach to She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She’s pulsing electronics and break beats are there in 2013’s Pain Is Beauty. 2015’s Abyss established a space between folk and industrial and noise rock and metal. 2017’s Hiss Spun burrowed deeper into heaviness. Wolfe returned to her earlier, folkier beginnings on 2019’s Birth of Violence, which was recorded at home in Northern California, and links back to 2012’s acoustic collection of songs, Unknown Rooms.\n\nOpener “Whispers in the Echo Chamber,” ties together a number of elements Wolfe has explored in the past, rolling in dynamic waves between minimal synth electronic and heavy, full-band moments, and refracted through a hall of mirrors. The explosive “House of Self-Undoing,” a song about Wolfe getting sober after the touring for her last album concluded, feels like electronica meets post-hardcore. Wolfe explains, “When you become sober after years of numbing out, you feel, deeply: the moments of joy are euphoric, and the moments of pain are more visceral. But it’s like a call to adventure, facing life fully present is exciting when you’ve spent half your life only half-present.” Wolfe describes the song as an underworld journey – this journey takes many forms.\n\nThe slow-burn “Everything Turns Blue” is an anthem about “finding yourself again after a long era of being part of something toxic,” she says. ”Making a split with someone after 10 years, 20 years, 30 years—there’s going to be some high highs and low lows as you begin to process it all.” The production here is deep, smoky, cavernous, and glitchy. Wolfe’s voice is raw, honest, and carries a weight with it, the feeling of burnout and also healing. “I’ve been living without you here/ and it’s alright/ I’d been looking for a way out a long time/ I’ve been living without you here and I can fight/ I’ve been living softly my whole life,” she sings. On this track, Wolfe asks another question central to She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She: “What do I have to do to heal you out of me?”\n\nCloser “Dusk,” which opens smoky and sensual and ends as a towering psychedelic guitar shredder, sees an empire burning and dissipating, and a dusk before a new dawn. It’s a sentiment echoed throughout She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She. On “Tunnel Lights,” a song that has a late-nite Twin Peaks feel until it cracks open into a miasmic swirl of analog and electric waves, is about, as Wolfe describes, “actually living instead of just ‘getting by,’ about waking up to the fact that you’ve been languishing in the dark and it’s time to start taking steps towards the lights that’ll guide you out of the tunnel-cave.”\n\nAt its core, She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She is realizing the way forward is through, contemplating what must be cut and left behind, while also figuring out what lies ahead and what there is to discover once you get there. Wolfe guides us on that quest, asking us these questions as she asks herself the same. As the title of the album hints, She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She is a reminder to look within, to remember that all the power you need resides there. Reach out to the selves, reach out to one other. Reach to the ancient and to the end of all things, to remember that the only time we truly have is now.\n\nSleater-Kinney – No Rope\n\nThere is about grief the necessary aftertaste of dreaming. In the wake of sudden loss – a moment, a person, a way of being brought violently to an end – the thing lost is gone but not its outline, a strange unstable place in which festers all manner of strange unstable thinking. The rules of reality temporarily subside, and mourning makes of the world a negative space.\n\nPlunged without warning into that space, Sleater-Kinney returns with Little Rope, one of the finest, most delicately layered records in the band’s nearly 30-year career. To call the album flawless feels like an insult to its intent – it careens headfirst into flaw, into brokenness, a meditation on what living in a world of perpetual crisis has done to us, and what we do to the world in return. On the surface, the album’s ten songs veer from spare to anthemic, catchy to deliberately hard-turning. But beneath that are perhaps the most complex and subtle arrangements of any Sleater-Kinney record, and a lyrical and emotional compass pointed firmly in the direction of something both liberating and terrifying: the sense that only way to gain control is to let it go.\n\nIn the Autumn of 2022, Carrie Brownstein received a call from Corin Tucker, who herself had just received a call from the American embassy in Italy. Years earlier, Brownstein listed Tucker as her emergency contact on a passport form, and while she had since changed her phone number, Tucker had not. The embassy staff were desperately trying to reach Brownstein. When they finally did, they told her what happened: While vacationing in Italy, Brownstein’s mother and stepfather had been in a car accident. Both were killed.\n\nIn the months that followed, Brownstein took solace in an act that felt deeply familiar – playing guitar. “I don’t think I’ve played guitar that much since my teens or early twenties,” she says. “Literally moving my fingers across the fretboard for hours on end to remind myself I was still capable of basic motor skills, of movement, of existing.”\n\nAs Brownstein and Tucker moved through the early aftermath of the tragedy, elements of what was to become the emotional backbone of Little Rope began to form – how we navigate grief, who we navigate it with, and the ways in which it transforms us. Sometimes the process of putting the songs together involved Tucker and Brownstein alone in a room with nothing more than a couple of guitars and amplifiers – a process unchanged since the band started recording in the mid-90s. Sometimes songs that started out quiet slowly transformed into something triumphant. Sometimes the triumphant ones turned out to be quiet songs in disguise.\n\nThe result is a collision of certainty and uncertainty that’s evident from the first few spare seconds of the record’s opening track, “Hell,” where over an agoraphobic expanse of tone and a trickle of chords, Little Rope’s emotional thesis statement begins to take form:\n\nHell don’t have no worries\n\nHell don’t have no past\n\nHell is just a signpost when you take a certain path\n\nIt’s a restrained, controlled prologue, but control is fleeting. A few seconds later, well, all hell breaks loose.\n\nThat interplay of lyrical and musical moods gives the record an immense depth. Even the catchiest hooks are hiding something. The album’s second track, “Needlessly Wild,” starts out delicious, the single-syllable “wild” bending like taffy. But then the lyrics betray something a little more malicious, a little more marked by pain, and soon “I’m needlessly wild” festers into “I’m needless and wild, needless and wild.”\n\nTime and again – on second, third, tenth listen – the songs on Little Rope begin to upend their initial impressions. The jangly, upbeat “Don’t Feel Right” camouflages an unshakable loneliness, a longing for something that’s never coming back. In “Hunt You Down,” the opening riff sounds a warning that smashes against a chorus delivered with a hint of deceptive sweetness: “The thing you fear the most will hunt you down” – a line Brownstein heard in an interview with a funeral director, said to him by a father preparing to bury his child.\n\nOne of the album’s standout tracks, “Say It Like You Mean It,” is an amalgam of so much of what the band does best – an unforgettable, unadorned riff backing a raw examination of a relationship coming apart, and the damage done by an insincere goodbye. It’s an exposed nerve ending of a song.\n\nLittle Rope also marks the first time the band has worked with Grammy Award-winning producer John Congleton.\n\n“We’ve actually wanted to work with John for a long time, but it wasn’t until this record that the stars aligned and we made it happen,” says Tucker. Congleton’s fingerprints are all over the album – he built a lot of the atmospherics in songs such as “Hell” or “Six Mistakes,” which both started out as much more spare tracks. It was also Congleton who heard the Tucker’s first run at the vocals for “Say It Like You Mean It” needed rework, a piece of advice that at first didn’t land too well.\n\n“I was fuming inside, but I decided to take the song home that night and think about it,” Tucker says. “I woke up in the middle of the night and a new vocal melody popped into my head, which I sang very quietly into my phone at 3 in the morning. The next day I came back into the studio and sang the new version, and it turned out John was right – the song needed that reworking to get at the emotional peak.”\n\nIn many ways, Little Rope unleashes one of Sleater-Kinney’s most potent weapons: the shattering emotional range of Tucker’s vocals. In an album so centered on the vulnerability required to face the world as it is, Tucker manages to find her way from composure to its utter absence, and what she conjures is a series of visceral turns, a sharper, heavier manifestation of a rawness that’s always been there, most notably on the band’s early landmark record, Dig Me Out. Perhaps the most unforgettable of these moments comes near the very end of the album, in the brilliant closing track, “Untidy Creature” – a song that almost didn’t make it onto the record, but ends up being the perfect coda, at once the biggest-sounding track on the record and its most lyrically intimate:\n\nBut there’s too much here that’s unspoken\n\nAnd there’s no tomorrow in sight\n\nCould you love me if I was broken\n\nThere’s no going back tonight\n\nThen the chorus gives way, and in its place a deep, desperate wail that closes one of the most honest and soul-bearing albums by one of modern rock’s most vital bands.\n\nMeechy Darko\n\nThe bio you are reading right now, like all bios, is by its very nature inaccurate. Okay, “inaccurate” may be too strong a word. Let’s go with “imprecise.” In a perfect world, this bio would express the thoughts, feelings and motivations of its subject as close as you can get with the written word. But what if the subject is perpetually changing? Not on a yearly or monthly basis, but weekly? Daily? Hourly? By the minute?\n\nFor an artist like Meechy Darko, who has achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success as one-third of Brooklyn hip-hop group Flatbush Zombies, getting more personal was a fait accompli decided for him by external forces.\n\n“I had no choice but to make this the most personal thing I’ve ever done because fortunately or unfortunately, I’m in an extremely soul-stirring part of my life right now,” he says. “Who I was yesterday may not be who I am tomorrow. I’m not who I was last week. There’s no telling who I’ll be next year or the year after, so it’s very important to capture this while I can still feel.”\n\nHe’s talking about Gothic Luxury, the rapper’s debut album after numerous LPs, EPs and mixtapes with his group. Meechy Darko is well aware that the “crazy shit, crazy-colored hair and psychedelics” of his group “are imprinted in the brains of many fans.” But on Gothic Luxury, drawn-out piano intros and laid-back funk meld with dark mini-symphonies that complement the album’s intensely candid themes; as a result, the album comes off as far more a solo album than an offshoot of the group.\n\n“Gothic Luxury is a terminology and a mood I created in my head so I knew where to stay when I’m writing,” the rapper says, noting that it’s a quasi-continuation to the group’s acclaimed 2018 album Vacation in Hell. “Even with success, you can have the biggest king-sized bed, but you still can be lonely as hell at night. Even with all this great stuff going on around you, I don’t ever forget the darkness. I can’t escape it. It’s about finding comfort in the darkness, accepting it and becoming part of it, but in the boss way possible.”\n\nWhile the genesis of some songs go back to 2018, the album was started in earnest in early 2020. For the record, the Zombies are still very much together. However, Meechy eschews the production of Zombies producer Erick the Architect to avoid falling back into “a comfort zone I’ve been in for years.” Inspired by Rick Ross — “His voice has so much bravado and bass over angelic, symphonic beats” — it’s an album informed by many things, not the least of which is the killing of the rapper’s father in 2020.\n\nGrief is an amorphous, mutable emotion, with the rapper admitting to still processing the death. “I didn’t want to exploit it,” he says. “I really want to understand how I feel before I tell people how I feel. Once you tell your story, people are not always gonna know the backstory or give you the benefit of the doubt. It’s very conflicting.”\n\nThe autobiographical “On God” invokes his father’s funeral; the man who molded the rapper’s personality and psyche. “He may be dead in the flesh, but what it really did is resurrect me,” Meechy says. “His spirit is in me now.” Elsewhere, “Every Time,” written before his father’s death, recalls the rapper talking to his dad in stark detail.\n\n“Kill Us All,” which finds Meechy bringing his “Tupac back-against-the-wall energy,” touches on everything from conspiracy theories to government and corporate overreach to the role of media in shaping public perception, while “What If” finds the rapper challenging both himself and the audience with a concept song around the titular phrase. ”I felt naked dropping an album that didn’t have a concept song,” he says. “I know that when a concept is put in front of me I rap in my highest form.”\n\nDespite the myriad musical undercurrents that flow throughout the album, there’s a through line of brutal honesty and catharsis that continues to find Meechy Darko among the rawest and most candid rappers in the game. “I use the studio as my journal,” he says. “I kinda wear my heart on my sleeve. I’m like a trigger-sensitive gun with a big extended clip. When I shoot, I SHOOT. I don’t want to bottle any of this stuff up. I know what separates me from them: It’s my lack of fear when it comes to saying what I think of something or how I feel about it.”\n\nMargo Price\n\nMargo Price has got nothing to prove, and nothing to promote but the truth. Today, with the release of new single and video “Been To The Mountain,” she takes both a hard look at the past and a firm step into the future. She has been a lover, a queen and a drifter, a cowboy devil, a bride and a boxer; a child, mother and even a number. Over a flurry of fuzzed-out guitar, she belts about being on food stamps, rolling in dirty dollars and standing in the welfare line. But across five and half minutes of the song’s unflappable groove, underlined by organ, harpsichord, and a soul-stirring, spoken-word breakdown in the bridge, Price previews another stronger, freer side of herself that will soon be seen.\n\n“Been To The Mountain” was produced by Jonathan Wilson (Angel Olsen, Father John Misty), written by Margo Price and Jeremey Ivey, and recorded during a blissful week they spent at Fivestar Studios in California’s Topanga Canyon. With a scorching sound that expands upon the rock n roll roots Price showcased on 2020’s widely acclaimed That’s How Rumors Get Started, the song is accompanied by a mind-altering, mushroom trip of a music video directed by Courtney Hoffman and shot in Los Angeles.\n\n“‘Been To The Mountain’ is part one of an introspective trip into our subconscious. It is the perfect continuation of my search for freedom in my art and freedom in the modern age,” says Margo Price. “I have a lot of high hopes for this next chapter and truly believe this is the most exciting music I’ve ever made in the studio with my band. We have all grown so much, we operate like one single organism – it’s telepathic. Courtney Hoffman brought my wild visions to life with the help of an incredible cast and crew in the music video. I wanted the story’s hypothetical 8 to 12 hour window to feel like a mini-lifetime. We also wanted to portray how an intense psychedelic experience has the potential to become a spiritual experience, and how that can change your perception of the world around you.”\n\nIn addition to unveiling “Been To The Mountain,” Margo Price is proud to announce her own Sonos Radio podcast, Runaway Horses. Beginning today with an inspiring interview from Emmylou Harris, the series will see Price host raw, cathartic conversations with artists who aren’t afraid to break the mold and follow their own path. All six of the episodes in this first season are about the search for freedom through music and the shared human experience, featuring influences, heroes and contemporaries like Amythyst Kiah, Swamp Dogg, Bob Weir, Bettye LaVette and Lucius. New installments of Runaway Horses will be released weekly for the next five Thursdays, and are available on Sonos Radio in the Sonos app, the Sonos Radio website and all major podcast platforms.\n\nOn the launch of Runaway Horses, which evolved out of an internet radio program she started live-streaming in the earliest days of the COVID-19 lockdown, Margo Price says, “The thing about runaway horses is that you can really never truly break them. They are incredibly unpredictable. You never know what they’re going to do next. I’m calling this show ‘Runaway Horses’ because wild freedom is exactly what I crave from music — I just want a complete and total release. I hope that the conversations on this show help you feel a sense of freedom, too.”\n\nIn the coming months, Margo Price will continue a busy year of touring with performances at Sacred Rose, Born and Raised and other festival appearances, plus Red Rocks with Wilco, and Farm Aid, where she recently became the first-ever female artist elected to the Board of Directors. She will also embark on a national book tour throughout October and November, in support of her forthcoming, debut memoir, Maybe We’ll Make It. Out October 4th on University of Texas Press, it tells a story of loyalty, loss, grief and forgiveness, from moving to Nashville with $57, to losing one of her newborn twin boys, pawning her wedding ring and facing rejection by almost every record label in town, to eventually reclaiming her power, freeing herself from substance abuse, and fighting for the opportunity to be herself in the music business. “Margo’s book hits you right in the gut – and the heart – just like her songs,” says Willie Nelson."
