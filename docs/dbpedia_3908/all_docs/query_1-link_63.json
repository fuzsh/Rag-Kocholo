        "text": "FTD is pleased to announce 'Elvis As Recorded At Madison Square Garden' 3-CD Box Set with an estimated shipping date is April 24.\n\nHaving just concluded an immensely successful sell-out tour in April, that was filmed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the 1972 documentary Elvis On Tour, confidence in Elvis' camp was high as all four shows at New York's Madison Square Garden were sold out along with the rest of the June tour. Any reticence that Elvis may still have had about performing in the Big Apple were soon allayed as the noise from the MSG audiences was deafening. Summing up the triumph, The New York Times 'Arts and Leisure' headline read 'Like A Prince From Another Planet'.\n\nElvis As Recorded at Madison Square Garden featuring the evening show on June 10 was rush-released later in the month, and sold a million copies in the U.S. in a matter of weeks. Total U.S. sales to date are now in excess of 3 million thereby achieving triple-platinum status. The afternoon show was eventually issued by RCA in 1997, 20-years after Elvis' passing, as An Afternoon In The Garden.\n\nThis belated 50th Anniversary FTD edition celebrates these legendary shows with newly mixed versions of both shows by Memphian recording engineer Matt-Ross Spang. Disc 3 features the original press conference recorded at the New York Hilton, June 9.\n\nPackaged in our 'sessions' style 8\" x 8\" slipcase, this deluxe 3-CD contains a 20-page color booklet, great photos, memorabilia, press conference transcript and recollections by the late Phil Gelormine.\n\n'Elvis As Recorded At Madison Square Garden' (3-CD)\n\nDisc 1\n\nEVENING SHOW\n\n01 Also Sprach Zarathustra\n\n02 That's All Right\n\n03 Proud Mary\n\n04 Never Been To Spain\n\n05 You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\n\n06 You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\n\n07 Polk Salad Annie\n\n08 Love Me\n\n09 All Shook Up\n\n10 Heartbreak Hotel\n\n11 (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel\n\n12 Love Me Tender\n\n13 The Impossible Dream (The Quest)\n\n14 Introductions\n\n15 Hound Dog\n\n16 Suspicious Minds\n\n17 For The Good Times\n\n18 An American Trilogy\n\n19 Funny How Time Slips Away\n\n20 I Can't Stop Loving You\n\n21 Can't Help Falling In Love\n\n22 Closing Vamp\n\nDisc 2\n\nAFTERNOON SHOW\n\n01 Also Sprach Zarathustra\n\n02 That's All Right\n\n03 Proud Mary\n\n04 Never Been To Spain\n\n05 You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\n\n06 Until It's Time For You To Go\n\n07 You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\n\n08 Polk Salad Annie\n\n09 Love Me\n\n10 All Shook Up\n\n11 Heartbreak Hotel\n\n12 (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel\n\n13 Love Me Tender\n\n14 Blue Suede Shoes\n\n15 Reconsider Baby\n\n16 Hound Dog\n\n17 I'll Remember You\n\n18 Suspicious Minds\n\n19 Introductions\n\n20 For The Good Times\n\n21 An American Trilogy\n\n22 Funny How Time Slips Away\n\n23 I Can't Stop Loving You\n\n24 Can't Help Falling In Love\n\n25 Closing Vamp\n\nRecorded live June 10, 1972 at Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nDisc 3"
