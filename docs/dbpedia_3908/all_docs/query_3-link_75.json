        "text": "Among music critics, Vampire Weekend‘s records score consistently well. Unfortunately, their rate of output is not as consistent with six years passing between 2019’s Father of the Bride, their fourth record, and their previous record. During that period, I don’t think I made serious voluntary attempts to listen to their music (though I did catch former member Rostam Batmanglij’s show earlier this year and their set in support of Bernie Sanders 2016 Presidential candidacy a few years back as it seemed the thing to do at the time)\n\nThis year though, with the release of Father of the Bride, the band has me hooked. While the album starts with a stirring slow burn, it quickly attains a massive sound with perfectly crafted pop hooks. It’s peppered with styles of music from all around the world, and I’ve had it on repeat often. But it was still surprising to hear the Vampire Weekend were headlining Madison Square Garden on September 6th. This indie rock group influenced a younger audience more than I realized. Yet even without Rostam, they group still sound formidable; members include vocalist Ezra Koenig, guitarists Chris Baio and Brian Robert Jones, Will Canzoneri and Greta Morgan on keys, and Chris Tomson, and Garrett Ray on drums.\n\nBut Vampire Weekend exceeded all my expectations at this arena show. It was an inspiring performance that lasted nearly three hours and included 32 songs, guest appearances from Angélique Kidjo and Steve Lacy (of the Internet), synchronized light-up wristbands (the kind Taylor Swift uses at her stadium shows), t-shirt cannons, and giant inflatable globes tossed into the crowd for the finale.\n\nPhotos: Sachyn Mital\n\nNot everything can be perfect, of course. The band lost a bit of energy when Lacy, a Father of the Bride collaborator, made his live debut with the group. Vampire Weekend backed him on his track, “Dark Red”, before they played the Father of the Bride song, “Sunflower”. And about ten minutes before 11:00 pm, Koenig started taking requests (at least one came from a person’s hat) which slowed things down right before what would be the climax.\n\nBut there were numerous highlights. Kidjo performed on “Jerusalem, New York, Berlin”, outshining Koenig with her dance moves (some of Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes” was worked in fittingly). At one point, turning to the back of the arena (all the seats were sold), Koenig played “Hold You Now” letting it conclude with a gorgeous rainbow sweeping through the crowd before going right into the feel-good hit, “Harmony Hall”.\n\nAnd those are just the tracks from the new record. Prior hits they played included “A-Punk”, “Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa”, “Diplomat’s Son”, and “Walcott” (the predictable finale). Each sounded superb in a live setting.\n\nDuring a live stream of the Madison Square Garden show, the band announced a string of US dates for 2020 that will continue a few months after their 2019 dates conclude.
