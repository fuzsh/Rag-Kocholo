        "text": "ABOUTSTUDIO THREE\n\nThe smallest but arguably the most famous of our studios, the design of Studio Three has been copied over and over by recording studios across the globe. But only here can artists channel the lush, syrupy sound that catapulted acts like The Mamas and The Papas into the annals of music history. The room comes complete with a Steinway B grand piano and private artist lounge.\n\nSome of the most iconic hits of the 60s were born here. The Mamas and the Papas recorded “California Dreaming” and “Monday, Monday” in this studio, along with Scott McKenzie’s classic “San Francisco”. But one album recorded here stands above all the rest – The Beach Boy’s 1966 masterpiece Pet Sounds."
