        "text": "There seems to have been countless times I’ve had the opportunity to see Dispatch live but for some reason or another, I’ve missed them every time they’re in the NYC area. I’ve heard nothing but great things about their live show, and then they announced that they would be returning to Madison Square Garden, I knew I couldn’t miss it. I apprently wasn’t the only one who couldn’t, as the demand was so high they sold out the first show with opener John Butler Trio and added a second show, bringing Dr. Dog along as the opener.\n\nAs a longtime fan of Dr. Dog, I was excited that they were opening for Dispatch as its the biggest venue they’ve played to date (minus some festivals), especially since we saw them earlier this year was at the much smaller and more intimate Music Hall of Williamsburg. MSG is prestigious regardless if your headlining or opening, and playing there has got to be an amazing feeling. With that, I had absolutely no doubt that their sound will fill out the arena, but I didn’t realize how well it did. They seemed as comfortable as anybody who’s played MSG before, ripping through their 11 song set with total ease. I’m not sure drummer Eric Slick even took a break – as soon as one song ended, he began jamming out the beat to the next song creating no real break from song to song. It was impressive, and if people in the crowd didn’t know who they were before, I’m sure they know who they are now.\n\nBefore Dispatch took the stage, the house lights dimmed and a video montage played up on the screens on the side of the stage. The video was showcasing and shining a light on the issue of hunger in the US – after all, the show was aptly titled, “Dispatch: Hunger.” One of the goals for the 2 night run is to raise more awareness about hunger in the US in that it is an important issue people might not think about. As part of the show’s info, it stated that ‘1 in 6 Americans (roughly 46.2 million) struggle to put food on their tables and 1 in 5 American children don’t have enough to eat.’ It’s a shocking stat and one that people might not think about. Part of the awareness wasn’t just the 2 night run at MSG, Dispatch also set up several other events across the US to get people involved and aware.\n\nDispatch are no strangers to attaching a cause to their shows, as their last time at MSG was for a sold out 3 night run called “Dispatch: Zimbabwe.” Those shows were the first major concerts for the band after they went on a ‘hiatus,’ and also were to help raise awareness and money for charities that help fight disease, famine, and social injustice in Zimbabwe.\n\nAs soon as the video montage finished, Chad, Pete & Brad took the stage and jumped right into their set and boy did they deliver. Hearing songs performed live that I’ve come to know and love studio recordings of was an absolute treat as the songs sounded even better live with more energy and life to them that I could ever imagine. Chad, Brad & Pete exchanged smiles throughout the entire night, vibing off each others energy perfectly. Something I’m sure nobody was even expecting was that we were even treated to Pete’s first time playing drums live on stage at a Dispatch show! It was surely a sign to see just how much fun they were having throughout the entire night. It was also impressive to see how much they can move from song to song, and instrument from instrument throughout their set without missing a beat. Brad came out from the drums several times to play guitar or uke while Chad & Pete swapped guitar & bass for a few songs. They are true masters of their craft and 18+ years into their career, continue to shine & clearly be onto of their game.\n\nAlong with all the classics and hits Dispatch fans have come to know and love, they also had played their newest song called “Bound By Love.” Before playing the song, Chad reminded the audience that all proceeds from song sales in the month of July will support partners and charities Dispatch works with (Center for Hunger-Free Communities and Witnesses for Hunger, the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, No Kid Hungry, and WhyHunger).\n\nJust when everybody thought the night couldn’t get any better, towards the end of their set they elevated their sound even more by bringing out the Funky Dawgz Brass Band to help out with a few Dispatch classics, ‘Bats in the Belfry’ and ‘The General.’ I don’t think their was a single person in the crowd who wasn’t signing, moving or jumping along with the songs – at one point I even felt the main floor/GA area begin to shake which was incredible to say the least.\n\nIt was an absolute amazing night all around, and to think they followed up night one with another killer set on night 2!\n\nDr. Dog Setlist:\n\n1.
