        "text": "Billy Joel is celebrating his 100th Madison Square Garden residency show in a very big way.\n\nThe milestone show, which takes place on March 28, will be filmed for a special that will air on CBS. This special will air on Sunday, April 14 at 9 PM ET. It’s aptly named “The 100th: Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden — The Greatest Arena Run of All Time.” CBS notes in a press release that this is the Piano man first concert to air on a broadcast network.\n\nJoel announced last year that he would be ending his Madison Square Garden residency in July 2024. The final show has been announced for July 25, 2024, which will be Joel’s 150th career performance at the legendary venue.\n\nThe remaining MSG residency shows are as follows:\n\n-March 28, 2024\n\n-April 26, 2024\n\n-May 9, 2024\n\n-June 8, 2024\n\n-July 25, 2024\n\nPer Ultimate Classic Rock, Joel said during a June 2023 press conference about the end of his residency, “I’m kind of flabbergasted that it lasted as long as it did. My team tells me that we could continue to sell tickets, but ten years … 150 shows — all right already!”\n\nJoel’s Big February\n\nThe announcement of his CBS special is just the latest major news Joel has made in February. On the first day of the month, he released “Turn the Lights Back On.”\n\nJoel’s last new piece of music was 2007’s “Christmas in Fallujah,” a collaboration with Cass Dillon. The Piano Man’s last studio album was 2001’s Fantasies and Delusions, which was made up of all classical compositions. His last non-classical album, of course, was 1993’s River of Dreams.\n\nDays later, on Feb. 4, Joel performed his new single at the 2024 Grammy Awards. His performance was prefaced with the intro below. Joel said in the video, “A lot of people asked me, ‘Why did you stop writing?’ It’s because I didn’t want to. Some people have a great time with it, [but] I kind of suffer with songwriting.”\n\nBilly Joel: His 20 Best Songs Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
