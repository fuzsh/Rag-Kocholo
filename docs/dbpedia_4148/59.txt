Looking at the stills of Shadow, one is reminded of Venkates's get-up in Dharma Chakram. If his look seems every bit daunting, the feel one gets of Meher Ramesh's stylish film is that it is very intense and slick action movie.

Also starring Srikanth, Tapsee and Madhurima, the film has music by SS Thaman. Thaman is using a new set of in-trend musical instruments for the first time. The music, says script writer Gopi Mohan, will sound radically different from Thaman's previous albums for this reason.

Meher is seemingly taking all the care in casting the right ones. Aditya Pancholi, the Bollywood villain, is making his Telugu debut in Shadow. This well-built actor was famously seen recently in Salman Khan's Bodyguard. He looks like a Hollywood villain, and he may just add to the Hollywoodish feel of this film the title of which is in English! The film is written by Kona Venkat and Gopi Mohan. The second schedule will begin from March 6. Click the Movie button below for more info:
