neekosam story shoban dharma chakram movie written by vijay

I saw Dharmachakram on the second day of its release (July 26, 1980) in Hyderabad Sangam A/c [On that day, I saw first Show of Chesina Baasalu (23rd day) in Hyderabad Sandhya 70mm A/c and immediately went to second show to see DharmaChakram]. Shobhan's role is CID inspector Vikram. I do remember the story vaguely but I enjoyed the film throughly. Shobhan's getup is superb in the film and there is a suspense element in the film. Jayaprada looks glamourous in the film. At that time, I enjoyed Govulu kaache gutta meedha song mroe than Karigi pmmandhi oka chinuku (rain song) which I enjoyed later. Shobhan will be arrested due to some reason (which I do not remember now) and he wll say "Dharma Chakram nilabedathaanu" in police jeep while he was arrested and taken to prison and title Dharmachakram will be seen. I remember some palace (abondoned one, I think) where some mystery will be there and he will solve the mystery (villain hideout or something like that). The film is an out and out entertainment but failed to impress the audience somehow.
