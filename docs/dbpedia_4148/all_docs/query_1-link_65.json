        "text": "Ghandikota V. Subba Rao\n\nPrashanthi Nilayam\n\nChristmas, 1999\n\nDIVINE WORSHIP\n\nIn the ancient Vedhik tradition, the worship of the Divine takes mainly three forms:\n\nIn the outer physical or gross form, an idol or image or picture of that divinity is worshipped; this is called representational type of worship i.e. Pratheekopaasana.\n\nThat same divinity is worshipped in terms of particular sound forms or sacred letter/word forms. This is called subtle type of contemplation, Bhavopaasana.\n\nIf that Divinity is fully internalised, and installed within the heart of the worshipper, and worshipped with single-minded devotion that worship is classed as \"Self absorption in the divinity, Ahamgrahopaasana. If such contemplation becomes automatically continuous, the distinction between the worshipped and the worshipper ceases and the seeker is united as it were, with the Divinity.\n\nGenerally speaking, Vedhik Worship of a Divine personality is performed through the composite use of:\n\nholy sacred formulae (Manthras)\n\npotentised diagrammatic inscriptions of letters/words pertaining to that Deity i.e. Yanthra or Chakra and\n\na set of specific procedures or methodology of worship called Thanthra.\n\nSATHYA SAI, WORLD'S SPIRITUAL BEACON-LIGHT\n\nA great doyen of Vedhik learning, culture and practice, late Shree Ghandikota Subrahmanya Shasthriji, the seer of Shree Sathya Sai Gaayathree Manthra (called a sage by Bhagavaan Shree Sathya Sai) had repeatedly authenticated the Divinity of Bhagavaan Baba by utilising a number of scriptural criteria based on the name, the meaning of the name, His form, His characteristics and qualities, His principles, practices, precepts, powers, preachings, pursuits, and teachings, etc. The revered Pandith concluded that Baba is a Divine Advent and Baba indeed is the epitomy of all divinities. Today Baba is the Supreme Spiritual Leader in the entire world. That is why this Divine Personality is the subject of dedication of the three Gaayathrees - Shree Saayeeshvara Gaayathree as early as 1977, the Sai Suurya Gaayathree in 1997 and Sai Hiranyagarbha Gaayathree in 1999. These three together have been termed by Baba as \"Sai-three\" (Details of these three manthras and their unique properties have been elaborated in Sai-three booklet and also in Sanaathana Saarathi, in its Thelugu version).\n\nINSPIRATION FOR THE SAI CHAKRA\n\nIt is again the divine inspiration of Bhagavaan Shree Sathya Sai, who is the presiding deity of the triple Gaayathree (or \"Sai-three\") manthras that prompted the preparation of this Sai Yanthra (or Chakra), which is a diagrammatic representation of Sathya Sai related Manthras, characteristics, powers, principles, pursuits, philosophy, preachings, miracles, glories, service activities, vital messages, etc. This Yanthra is the key to the understanding of the essence of the Sathya Sai Avathaar. It is a potentised mapping of the Sathya Sai spiritual 'terrain', being a subtle expression of Sai in Vedhik terminology. It is a composite multi-metric portrayal of Sai spirituality. This Chakra was prepared at the holy Brahma Muhuurtha (early dawn time). Monday 11th October 1999; that same afternoon, Baba called this writer for an interview at which He blessed this Yanthra thrice, after a discussion of its contents (please see the Sai Chakra shown below).\n\nPrathyaksha Bhagavaan Shree Sathya Sai-three Sapthamayee\n\nYanthra - Chakra\n\nDiagramatic representation of Sai's Triple Septets\n\n(Principles, Practices and Powers)\n\nDHYANAM:\n\nYo Dhevah Sathyasaayinah\n\nBuddhim Dharmaadhi Gocharaam\n\nPrerayeth Thasya Yath Thejah\n\nThadhvarenyam Upaasmahe||\n\nNAMASKAARAM:\n\nSarvanaama-dharam Shivam\n\nSarva Ruupa-dharam Shaantham\n\nSath, Chith, Aanandham Adhvaitham\n\nSathyam Shivam Sundharam ||\n\nDhakshine Hasthachaalana-Vibhuuthim\n\nVaame Bhaktha-Lekha-Lasathkaram\n\nAayuraarogya Dhaathaaram\n\nSaayi-Dhanvathareem Upaasmahe||\n\nUchitha-Vidhyaa-Vaidhya-Sujalaadhi Aneka Prajaahitha Dharmakaarya -\n\nPhalapradhyakaaya Namo Namah||\n\nThe following links are for color images ( each about 320KB) of the Sree Sai Yanthra in\n\nSanskrit Thelugu\n\nSAITHREE SEPTET PRINCIPLES\n\nBaba once explained that His Avathaarik divinity is usually expressible in terms of Septets - i.e. Sapthamayee. That is why the full title of this Yanthra is \"Prathyaksha Bhagavaan Shree Sathya Sai-three Sapthamayee Yanthra - Chakra\".\n\nThe Sai Chakra is a mystic diagram of graphics of lines, circles, curves etc containing Sai's divine seven dimensional seed-principles which enable a Sai devotee to realise his or her highest i.e. Divine potential. The Chakra or Yanthra maps out systematically the steps in the integral evolution of Sai spiritual consciousness. The Sacred Seed Manthras or formulae filling the diagram, contain in a nutshell, the essence of Sai Spirituality. The Sai Yanthra contains an integral subtle picture of Sai phenomenology, theology and praxis to reach Divinity. That is why Yanthra worship is considered superior to image worship which is at the gross level. The points of the Yanthra correlate with the inner forces in each individual and link them with divine cosmic energies.\n\nThe contemplation of the Sai Chakra activates or turns our inner wheel (Chakra) of Spiritual energy opening vistas of Divine Truth, Goodness and Beauty i.e. Sathyam, Shivam and Sundharam, for realising the eternal, universal principle of Divine Bliss (Aanandham). The inner flowering of Sai consciousness results in the outer manifestation of pure love for all beings, without distinctions and of selfless service to the needy and suffering fellow living beings. This is the fulfilment of life leading to Self- and God realisation.\n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL POWER OF SAI CHAKRA\n\nThe divine Yanthras are generally encircled by a square. This is called Bhuu-Pura or Meru-Pura or Kailash-pura - the \"apex Spiritual City\". This constitutes the Universal Stage or altar or enclosure, where the play of the individual, collective and cosmic forces are at work in unison This Bhuu-Pura has been reverberating since eternity with the sound vibrations of OMKAAR, the source of all energies. It is the sound expression of Para Brahman, the Supreme principle of eternal Universal, Absolute or Pure Consciousness. OM is the Primal Sound, the SOUND of all SOUNDS, the singular SOUNDLESS SOUND.\n\nOMKAAR also represents the base source of all religions - namely Sanaathana Dharma the most ancient, and yet the most modern manifestation of spiritual consciousness. Bhagavaan Shree Sathya Sai is the embodiment in human form of the essence of all religions. BABA is SANAATHANA SAARATHI, the ancient and ever new Charioteer guiding humanity to its SUPREME GOAL of SELF- and GOD REALIZATION, in ONENESS, in UNITY, in IDENTITY with DIVINITY. He loves all religions. He is a Universal divine personality without any differences relating to caste, country, colour, creed, race and religion. He emphasizes: \"There is only one race, the race of humanity; There is only one religion, the religion of love; There is only one language, the language of the heart and there is only one God who is omnipresent. \"Love all, Serve all\" is Baba's Universal Dharma. The Bhagavath Geetha declares \"Samathvam Yogam Uchyathe\" Equal-mindedness is the true Yoga. That is why Baba speaks of the septet of Equality:\n\nEqual Vision (Sama Dhrishti)\n\nIntegral Unity (Sama Ikyatha)\n\nTotal integrity (Samagratha)\n\nEqual mindedness (Sauhaardhratha)\n\nEquilibrium of mind (Saumanasyam)\n\nEqual fraternity (Saubhraathratha)\n\nEqual essence of Life (Samarasam)\n\nThe dot at the centre of this Sai Yanthra is the non-dual, monistic, five-lettered, holy formula for deep contemplation, namely, \"Sai Shivoham\" I am this Supreme Universal Divine Source and Force, Shiva Sai. Sai is Shivashakthi. I am this Shivashakthi.\n\nThis central dot is the Light Supreme in the sanctum sanctorum; it is enclosed by an equilateral triangle - the three sides of which represent. \"Sathyam, Shivam, Sundharam\" Truth, Goodness and Divine Beauty. These are the triple spiritual illuminating impulses, radiating outward from the central area of the Yanthra and thereby sanctifying the whole Mandala or Sai spiritual field or terrain, which consists of nine spaces or areas each enclosing Sai principles. The Sai Spiritual terrain in between the outer perimeter of the square and the inner triangle is circumscribed by three circles, along which the three Sai Gaayathrees (named \"Sai-three\" by Baba) are inscribed. The \"Sai-three\" is the core foundational support, as it were, of this multi-dimensional structure, Sai Prashaanthi Kshethram - the Sai abode of perfect Peace, Tranquility and Bliss.\n\nSAI SIXTEEN DIVINE ATTRACTIONS\n\nJust as the Earth Goddess possesses the force of gravitational attraction, the Sathya Sai Avathaar exerts sixteen divine forces of attraction, sourced in the immense reservoir or great mass of His Divine Love:\n\nKAAMA AAKARSHANA: Power to fulfil legitimate desires of devotees.\n\nBUDDHYAAKARSHANA: Power to activate, stimulate devotees' intellect in the direction of enquiry of truth of the Self.\n\nSHABDHA AAKARSHANA: Power of divine sound vibrations, expressed through messages, teachings and instructions to seekers.\n\nAHAMKAARA AAKARSHANA: The power of inflating the ego of the devotee in the first instance and then deflating it to a point of egolessness.\n\nSPARSHA AAKARSHANA: The power of miraculous touch, healing touch, purifying touch and holy touch.\n\nRUUPA AAKARSHANA: Power of attraction of this divine bewitching beautiful Form.\n\nRASA AAKARSHANA: Power of overflowing sweetness, compassion and grace-filled protection and assurances to devotees.\n\nCHITTHA AAKARSHANA: Power of heart-to-heart attraction which is inexpressible in words but evokes overwhelming response from the devotee.\n\nGANDHA AAKARSHANA: Power of His divine fragrance exuding purity and holiness.\n\nDHAIRYA AAKARSHANA: The power of overwhelming courage and self-confidence.\n\nSMRITHYA AAKARSHANA: Power of phenomenal memory of the past, present and future.\n\nNAAMA AAKARSHANA: The power of chanting Sai's name, in terms of miraculous beneficial effects.\n\nBEEJA AAKARSHANA: Power of controlling or operating the \"seed\" forces of knowledge, consciousness, time and existence.\n\nAATHMA AAKARSHANA: Power of attracting the totality of our being.\n\nAMRITHA AAKARSHANA: Power of bestowing immortality.\n\nSARVA AAKARSHANA: The Sixteenth is the combination of all the above Powers - constituting integral holistic Divinity.\n\nSIXTEEN RADIATIONS OF SHREE SAI CHAKRA\n\nThe above Sixteen gravitational forces of Sai's Divine Love are the obverse of the following Sixteen radiational aspects of the Sathya Sai Avathaar epitomised in the Shree Sai Chakra.\n\nThis detailed explanation of the Sai Chakra begins from the outer square perimeter and sequentially moves inward in the direction of the central dot.\n\nClosely following the sides of the perimeter, the seven fold mission or purposes of the Sai Avathaar are specified as follows (Shree Sathya Sai Avathaara Prayojana Sapthakam).\n\nAakarshanaaya Sarva Janaanaam: Drawing all people of all ages, climes, castes, countries, colour or creeds without any distinction by His magnetic power of universal love.\n\nVikarshanaaya-cha Dhushkruthyaam: Weeding out the wicked qualities by His loving kindness, compassion and grace.\n\nSamskaranaaya Thaamasikaanaam: Reforming the inactive, the ignorant and the lazy by activating them towards the performance of their duties.\n\nSamkarshanaaya Raajasikaanaam: Rechannelling the energies of the selfishly active and passionate persons into the performance of selfless and altruistic activities benefiting society.\n\nUtkarashanaaya Saadhunnaam: Elevating the good and noble persons into ever higher levels of spiritual consciousness.\n\nSaakshaathkaaraaya cha Bhakthaanaam: Bestowing the direct vision of the Lord to the true devotees.\n\nPrema Sevaa Prakarshanaaya Sambhavaami Padhe Padhe: Manifesting by His own example, the principle of Selfless, loving, egoless service to the needy, Baba declares He will assume repeated advents.\n\nBaba is the embodiment of universal values of all religions. In the yanthra are inscribed the symbols of seven religions, as examples: Shree Sathya Sai Dharma Sapthakam. These and other religions are sourced and therefore headed by the Ancient, Eternal, Universal Religion, Sanaathana Dharma, symbolised by OMKAAR, The Pranava stands for both the Immanent and Transcendental aspects of the Supreme Spirit, Parabrahman.\n\nThe Zoroastrian or Parsi religion is symbolised by the flaming fire place in order to burn away our bad thoughts and desires.\n\nThe Jewish religion has \"Menora\" as its symbol. It consists of seven branches of lamps indicating that God created the world in six days, and the central shaft represents the Sabbath, the seventh day for rest.\n\nThe Buddhist Wheel stands for the wheel of time, the wheel of samsaar - the phenomenal world cycle, and most importantly for the wheel of righteousness which is the key to the release from bondage to Time.\n\nJain religion is symbolised by an outstretched palm of right hand bearing the word Ahimsa or non-violence, which is the corner stone of Jain faith. On top of the hand is the Svasthika whose four sides represent the four types of destinies of man. On top of the Svastika are three dots standing for spiritual knowledge, strong faith and good conduct as means of emancipation. There is a crescent with a top dot - all these elements covered by a rectilinear enclosure.\n\nThe Christian cross symbolises Self-sacrifice by crossing out or removing the ego.\n\nThe Islamic Crescent with moon inside is an inspiration for firm and steady faith in, and unflinching loyalty to, God.\n\nThe Sikh symbol consists of a double edged sword surrounded by a circular wheel or Chakra, held up by a sword on each side. The Chakra stands for the principle of infinity; the other symbols stand for Supreme Self-Sacrifice.\n\nIn the areas between the religions symbols and the first circular space are shown the Sathya Sai Saadhana Sopaana Sapthakam, or, the Seven Steps for Liberation. These are:-\n\nGood resolution (Sathsankalpam)\n\nGood company and character (Sathsangam)\n\nGood deeds (Sathkarma)\n\nLiving a spiritual life (Saalokya)\n\nLiving in close proximity to Divinity (Saameepya)\n\nExperiencing divine nature and Bliss (Saarurpya)\n\nBecoming one with the Divine (Saayujyam)\n\nIn the first circular space is inscribed the Shree Sathya Sai Suurya Gaayathree Manthra\n\nOm Bhaaskaraaya Vidhmahe\n\nSaayi Dhevaaya Dheemahi\n\nThannah Suryah Prachodhayaath\n\nMeaning: We recognise this Self effulgent Divine Advent Sathya Sai. We meditate on HIM with all our heart. We pray that this Sai Sun God dispel our inner darkness and bestow on us health, strength, stamina, skill and success in our daily duties.\n\nIn the inner space covered by Sai Suurya Gaayathree are the seven petals on which are inscribed the seven miraculous powers of Baba. These are Shree Sathya Sai Mahima Sapthakam:\n\nMagnetic miracle of Universal LOVE (Vishva Janeena Dhivya Aakarshana Shakthi).\n\nMaterialisation miracles: Undepleted power of creating a variety of articles of spiritual significance to the recipients (Sahaja Sankalpa Dhivya Dhravya Shrushti Shakthi).\n\nMind boggling medical miracles i.e. removing illnesses of the body, mind and intellect and above all of the ego; rescuing devotees from the jaws of death; appearing simultaneously at different places (Aadhi Vyaadhi, Apamruthyu Harana, Bhava Roga Nivaarana Shakthi).\n\nMighty Metaphysical miracles of teachings, preachings and reachings; expressing deep philosophical truths in the simplest possible language, understandable by the laymen and appreciated even by Pandiths (Jnaana, Vijnaana, Sujnaana Prabodha Pradhaana, Prasaara Shakthi).\n\nMonumental mega public service activities, and projects in the fields of free education, free medical services, free potable drinking water supplies, etc (Prema Sahitha Apaara Loka Sevaa Paraayana Shakthi).\n\nMicro and macro management miracles - planning, executing and managing a variety of smallest to highest tasks (Laghu Brihath KaaryaNirvaahaka, Vyavahaara Dhakshathaa Shakthi).\n\nMagnum man-making miracles i.e. changing, reforming, transforming, metamorphosing a vast number of persons for spiritual progress and welfare (Sarva Janaabhyudhaya Nishreyasa Parvivarthana Shakthi).\n\nIn between the above seven petals, and closely following the inner perimeter of the first circle, are inscribed the Shree Sathya Sai Dhevatha Shakthi Saptakam, or the seven fold divinities with their respective powers. These powers are embodied in Bhagavaan Baba who states that the self-same divinities and powers are present in a seed form in all individuals too.\n\nGaanaapathyam represents power of intellect\n\nVaishnavam represents power of right action\n\nShaivam\n\nrepresents power of non-dual, unifying knowledge\n\nShaaktham\n\n(Divine mother) represents the power of universal divine love\n\nBraahmayam\n\nrefers to the power of beneficial creative activity\n\nSauram\n\nrepresents Vital sacrificing power\n\nAathmeeyam\n\nrepresents the power of the Supreme Aathma\n\nAcross the seven leaves are inscribed Shree Sathya Sai Neethi Sapthakam - the seven fold moral disciplines; these are seven codes of conduct for Seekers:-\n\nDhamam - Control of outer senses\n\nDhayaa - Kindness and compassion\n\nDhaanthi - Mastery of inner senses\n\nDhaanam - Giving, sharing, caring\n\nDharmam - Righteous altruistic Self-sacrificing deeds\n\nDhairyam - Courage with Self-Confidence\n\nDhyaanam - Contemplation and meditation\n\nIn the second circle, Shree Sathya Sai Hiranyagarbha Gaayathree is inscribed:\n\nOm Premaathmanaaya Vidhmahe\n\nHiranyagarbhaaya Dheemahi\n\nThannah-sathyah Prachodhayaath\n\nMeaning: We recognise this Sathya Sai as the incarnation of Divine Love. We meditate on this Self Shining Golden-Wombed Divine Personality. Let this God of Truth destroy our six demonic qualities of Anger, Lust, Pride, Infatuation Greed and Jealousy and vivify our mental and intellectual faculties and lead us on the path of LOVE and Spiritual Elevation!\n\nFollowing the inside perimeter of this second circle, the Shree Sathya Sai Aathma Dharshana Sapthakam or the seven fold stages of Self Awareness and realisation are inscribed:\n\nAathma Vichaarana: Self Awareness through Self-enquiry\n\nAaathma Vishvaasam: Developing Self-Confidence\n\nAaathma Vijnaanam: Acquiring Wisdom of the Self\n\nAaathma Nivedhanam: Living in Self-Surrender\n\nAaathma Santhrupthi: Gaining Self-Satisfaction\n\nAaathma Thyaagam: Selfless, Self-Sacrifice\n\nAaathma Saakshaath-Kaaram: Reaching the state of bliss in Self-Realisation\n\nOn the seven petals between the second and third circles are inscribed the Shree Sathya Sai Upaasana Sapthakam - Sai's seven fold paths to Braahmik consciousness; Baba stated that these are the names of the Universal Divine Mother i.e. Gaayathree. They apply equally to Bhagavaan Baba.\n\nThe first method is called Sathyavathi, the quest for truth, investigating the underlying unity in all the phenomenal diversity.\n\nThe second method is called Angavathi or limb-based method by contemplating the Divine in its partial manifestations in nature e.g. The five great elements.\n\nThe third method is called Anyavathi - which proceeds by contemplating the Divine through various Sacred Symbols or insignia e.g. Idols or pictures representing the glorious form of divinity.\n\nThe fourth method is called Nidhaanavathi - the slow, but sure and steady path of graded steps to spiritual communion.\n\nThe fifth step is called Sujnaanavathi - the path of acquiring right knowledge of God, Nature and the Man: Living in the consciousness of Ayamaathma Brahma: This Aathma is God.\n\nThe sixth step is called Vijnaanavathi - reaching the highest state of wisdom of experiencing unity in all the diversity of the world and then contemplating on the statement Thathvamasi, Thou art that.\n\nThe seventh is called Prajnaanavathi which is the state of constant integrated total awareness in bliss supreme; experiencing the truth of the great aphorism, Aham Brahma Asmi: I am Brahman, the Supreme divinity.\n\nThe inmost third circle contains the Shree Sathya Sai (Eeshvara) Gaayathree:\n\nOm Saayeeshvaraaya Vidhmahe\n\nSathya Dhevaaya Dheemahi\n\nThannah Sarvah Prachodhayaath\n\nMeaning: We have come to know through scriptures, preceptors and by our own experience that Sathya Sai is the Supreme Divinity. We meditate whole heartedly on this God of Truth. We pray that He, the Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnipresent Divine Personality destroy our ego and primal ignorance and grace us with Liberation!\n\nThe Shree Sathya Sai Siddhaantha Sapthakam or the seven basic Sai Values and principles for practice are inscribed on the seven petals in the inside area of the third circle. These are:\n\nSathya - Truth\n\nDharma - Righteous Action\n\nShanthi - Perfect Peace\n\nPrema - Selfless Love\n\nAhimsa - Hurt Never\n\nThyaaga - Help Ever; Sacrifice\n\nAanandham - All these culminating in Bliss in communion with God, Nature and Man.\n\nIn the fourth circle is the equilateral triangle, the three sides of which enclose the principles of Sathyam, Shivam, Sundharam i.e. Eternal Truth, all inclusive Goodness and Divine Beauty - the triple essence of Sathya Sai Avathaar. The person who knows Truth (Sathyam) and who lives his life in virtue (Shivam) will radiate Beauty and Bliss (Aanandham).\n\nAt the centre of this whole diagram is the non-dual holy formula \"Sai Shivoham\": I am none else than Sai Shiva\". This continuous unbroken consciousness will result in liberation and also unity with Shiva Sai Mahaadheva i.e. Saayujyam. The inspiration for this holy formula came on Mahaa Shiva Raathri, 1996.\n\nThe goal of the whole journey is reaching the mountain top when one's whole being is filled with the thought \"Sarvam Khalvidham Brahma\". All this is Brahman. This is the state of liberation while living (Jeevanmukthi). This is the Secret of the Sai Chakra.\n\nThe spiritual Seeker internalises this Sai Chakra and firmly installs in his body which then becomes Prasanthi Nilayam, the abode of eternal peace. This mode of Worship of the Sai Chakra is called the Sai Thanthra. As the devotee steadies this internal Chakra worship, his Kundalini (the coiled spiritual energy at the basal plexus) gets awakened, gradually courses upward to the Sahasraara Chakra (the thousand petalled lotus) in the crown of his head; the flow of Sai nectar becomes overwhelming. The Seeker is then liberated!"
