        "text": "what is surround sound?\n\nSurround sound refers to the use of multiple audio tracks to envelop the movie watching or music listening audience, making them feel like they're in the middle of the action or concert. The surround sound movie soundtrack allows the audience to hear sounds coming from all around them, and plays a large part in realizing what movie makers call \"suspended disbelief\". \"Suspended disbelief\" is when the audience is completely captivated by the movie experience and is no longer aware of their real-world surroundings.\n\nTrue surround sound formats rely on dedicated speakers that literally and physically surround the audience. There is one center speaker which carries most of the dialog (since the actors usually speak while making their on-screen appearance), and part of the soundtrack. There are left and right front speakers that carry most of the soundtrack (music and sound effects), and may carry parts of the dialog (when the director wants to intentionally off-set the source of the dialog to either side, from its default dead-center screen location). There is a pair of surround sound speakers that is placed to the side (and slightly above) of the audience to provide the surround sound and ambient effects. Finally, a subwoofer can be used to reproduce the low and very low frequency effects (LFE) that come with certain movies (e.g., the foot-stomping bass effects in \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Godzilla\").\n\nA typical surround sound home theater system\n\nThere are virtual surround sound algorithms (e.g., Sound Retrieval System [SRS] and other proprietary algorithms) that make use of only two left and right speakers and psycho-acoustics effects to emulate true surround sound formats. While we think the result is a more expansive soundstage with better ambiance, we have not heard a virtual surround sound implementation that comes anywhere close to resembling a true surround sound system. For the purposes of this discussion, we shall focus only on the true surround sound formats (that is, those that rely of multiple dedicated speakers)."
