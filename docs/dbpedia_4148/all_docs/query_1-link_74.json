        "text": "From the Bhakti List Archives\n\nâ€¢ October 21, 2001\n\nSrimadh Azhagiya Singar thiruvadikaLE saraNam (In this part we attempt to write in a very simply way as to who is Sri Chakra rAjan, prior to writing on the thala purAnam of Sri Chakra rAjan temple) ezhil Azhi iRaiyavan - part 2 - The \"will\" of the Lord (meaning for the title is given in part 1) Dear bAgawathAs, Vishu Samvathsaram, TulA Maasam Sukla Panchami 41st Pattam (Kaarukkurichci) Srimath Azhagiya Singar fo Sri Ahobila mutt, AarAdhana Dinam. Incidentally the Sri Chakra pAni temple at thiruk kudanthai was last renovated and the maha samprOkshanam was done under the divine command of this AchAryAn several years ago. After that, this is the first time such a major effort to renovate the temple is going on. Sri Chakra rAjan is third in line in our pArampariyam next only to perumAL and thAyAr. Many Sudarshana upAsakars describe that sEnai nAthar or viswakshEnA is the incarnation of none other than Sri Chakra rAjan HIMself. SwAmi dEsikan delivered as \"En vuyir thanthu ALitthavarai saraNam pukki \"..........................................\"sEnai nAthan\" in amuthath thiru magaL enRu ivarai munnittu emperumAL thiru vadigaL adaikinREnE\" - SwAmi dEsikan meaning: Among the several AchAryAs listed in this grantham that everyone recite at the time of prapatthi, the 3rd in line listed prior to Sriyap pathi Sriman nArAyaNan is sEnai nAthan. It may very well sound controversial for some bAgawathAs when we attempt to interpret this way. However adiyEn have heard from sudarshana upAsakars this way. In tamil sEnai or padai is also the name for Ayudham. When Sri chakra rAjan is sent on a mission HE is the delta force and one and only person and is the Army HIMself. He is the abode of all the weapons that were created ever in this universe. All weapons are subservient to Sri chakra rAjan. He is the rAjan of all the weapons. All the weapons that are possessed by the sillaRAi dEvathAs are created by Sri Chakra rAjan. All the weapons finally attain him as their mOksham. If one have to summersize as to who is Sri Chakra rAjan and add to the three thaathuvams explained by Sri V. Sadagopan, as seen by certain subtle verses explained in Sri Ahir budhya samihithA. Sri chakra rAjan is none other the \"will\" of the Lord Sriman nArAyaNA. If the Lord has decided to get done with someone such \"will\" who is already inthe form of Sri chakra rAjan manifests into a vasthu that is \"instrumental\" in fulfilling this \"will\". and accomplish the mission. Since HE is the will of the Lord he is never defeated. No force on earth can defeat Sri chakra rAjan as HE is the will of the Lord. In tamil it is said that \"avar thiru uLLam nadanthE theerum\". Everytime the Lord wants to accomplish a missoin, Sri chakra rAjan as HIS \"will\" takes the manifestation \"atonce\" and fulfills it. Name it, the \"kOrai paRkaL\" of Sri koormA, nails of Sri Lakshmi nrusihmA, the dharbai of Sri vAmanA, the power of kOdAli of Sri parasurAmA and so on. No one other than Sri chakra rAjan fulfills Lord's thiru uLLAm as HE is HIMself the thiru uLLam of the Lord. When Sri kAkAsuran committed apachAram to peria pirAtti, the Lord's \"will\" decided to punish him and the small \"darbhai\" that chased the kAkAsuran into all the lOkAs had the Sri chakra rAjan at its tip. Sri Indran advised kAkAsuran that the Ayudham is none other than \"will\" of the Lord and no one can stop this from punishing one. The only way for you is to seek refuge at the holy feet of the Lord and change his \"will\". When the \"will\" is written this way your fate will end this way. Then kAkAsuran did as advised by Sri Indran and got the \"will\" changed or else he would have been slain. Thus,this Sri chakra rAjan of thiruk kudanthai who is the \"will\" of the Lord and the one man Army who accomplishes the mission of the Lord every time is victorious for ever. He was never defeated and will never be because of another reason. One of the great thiruk kalyAna gunAs of the Lord is that HE is never defeated. Such thiruk kalyAna gunA has manifested as the thAyAr of Sri chakra rAjan known as Sri vijaya valli thAyAr. Since his consort is Sri vijaya vallith thAyAr (Lady Victorious) he was never defeated and he will never be defeated. In Sri Abeethi sthavam slokam 23 (*), SwAmi dEsikan pleads to Sri RanganAthan that \"prabhO, this place is full of virOdhis and their Adikkam is to be wiped out. Sri chakra rAjAn is one who is the \"soul\" or Athman for Agni, Sooryan and chandran the three sources through which the universe is lighted up. Through them it is Sri chakra rAjan who provide light and destroy this darkenss and annyAnam in this universe. His pradhAna Ayutham is Sri chakram itself. He has 15 other dominant weapons in order. All these weapons are contained in his swaroopam all the time. He works in unison with all the weapons in him work together when he is on a mission under his command as is the sEnai muthali of all these weapons that are embedded in this one man army. When comes out he conducts as similar to how the dEvathAs do in all humility and as if he is a very ordinary bAgawathA. Yet everything is embedded in him. He is the most potent of all of the weapons and and everyother one can think of. Your city of Sri rangam has to come back to normalcy and all the uthsavams of Sri rangam has to be celebrated without any stop. Your kainkaryam has to go on uninterruptted. nitya ArAdhanam has to continue for you for ever. The current crisis created by these virOdhis must come to an end soon. The prayOga chakram seated in your hand should auotmatically set out and spin around and establish the dharmam in this boolOga vaikundam Srirangam. The dharma chakram must revlove around once again in your kshEthram Srirangam and protect your uninterruptted kainkaryam. Swami dEsikan goes on to say in the 24th slOkam of Sri abeethi sthavam(**) \"You are superior and you are the sarva Otthaman. You You are the one who was worshipped from Sri Manu onwards in the most aupicious way with all the kramams and niyathi, SrirangarajA You are always induced by Sri ranganAyaki thAyAr and encouraged by Sri Boomi dEvip pirAtti in your karunyA sAgaram. Your mercy and aruL is similar to an ocean and it is always churned and kept active by pirAtti. The current terror and crisis that struck your city is created by those who are equal to asurAs. Your kArunyAm as induced by thAyArs must overflow and you must think in yourself and act to save this city. ie. . Your \"will\" must take shape in favour of destroying these evel forces and help us serve you uninterruptedly. You must have your thiru uLLam to save this city from the current crisis. First Swami dEsikan directly pleads to Sri chakra rAjan seated in the hand of Sri namperumAL. None other than Swami deikan had mastered the ahir budhanya samihitha so well. Realizing that Sri chakra rAjan is none other than the \"will\" of the Lord Swami dEsikan quickly prays in the next verse, for the \"will\" of the Lord to take place.
