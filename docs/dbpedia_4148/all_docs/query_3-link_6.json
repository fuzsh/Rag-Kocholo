        "meta_description": "There are songs in Tollywood which created sensation. Those are even being hummed my audience at work, travelling, before sleep and even in bathrooms. They are the songs which can be shuffled and played. There are few hit songs, from which they have taken words and kept as movie titles. But unfortunately most of the movies were flop at boxoffice. Let us see few of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMissamma: is a telugu movie, released in the year 1955 starring NTR and ANR directed by L.V prasad. From the movie, there Is a song called  “Ravoyi Chandamama ma vinda gada vinuma Ravoyi Chandamama” which was a super hit at the time. with the title “Ravoyi Chandamama” there was a film featuring Nagarjuna and anjala zhaveri which was directed by jayant paranji couldnt make its mark.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnr Aradhana: In this film starring ANR, there is a song “Naa Hrudayamlo Nidurinche Cheli kalalone kavvenche cheli” was also a hit number. With the title “Naa Hrudayamlo Nidurinche Cheli” Casting   Vadde Naveen, Laila, was a flop at box office.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajnu: in the film “Idi toli ratri, kadalani ratri , Neeku nenu naaku nuvvu cheppukunna kadala ratri...preyasi raave ...oorvasi raave” song was a good sentimental song. From the song there is a word called Preyasi raave with which Director chandra mahesh made a movie with srikanth was also a flop one.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPremante idera: from the movie, there is a song once hummed by everybody “nalo unna prema nitho cheppana” with the title naalo unna prema jagapathi babu and gajala starred movie was a big flop at box office.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkkadu: There is a song from the movie okkadu starring Mahesh babu “ chepave chirugaali challaga yedagilli, ekkade vasanthaala keli....” was a hit song. With the title “Cheppave chirugali” adopting for a movie directed by Vikraman starring venu was not a hit.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJayam: From the film Jayam, there is song called “Andamaina manasulo inyha alajadenduko...enduko enduko enduko...”  which was composed by R.P patnaik was the biggest hit song at that time. R.P made a movie as a director with the title named as  “Andamaina manasulo”  was a biggest flop in 2008.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso, is there any reason behind keeping names adopting  from movies? And the reason behind flops for the movies which are named from songs. Hypothetical its is.",
