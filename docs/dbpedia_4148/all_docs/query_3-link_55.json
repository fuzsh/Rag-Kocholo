Without further delay here is the full interview with her that gives a better understanding of her long years of singing on stage live shows and the formation of a golden voice.\n\nHer social media links here\n\nOn YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiCiw0r9nf8uKeahYZN9dug\n\nOn FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/janakibaala\n\nOn Instagram https://instagram.com/janakibaala?igshid=knhfuya5glia\n\nPlease briefly introduce yourself\n\nJanaki Baala, that is my name. I have more than twenty years of experience singing live on stage shows. I have already sung for more than fifty devotional albums and performed on many TV channels like Kalaignar TV, Pudhu Yugam, Jaya TV, etc. I am a self-starter. I enjoy practicing different types of songs to improve my skill and talent in music. My self-interest and my father’s motivation helped me to start a career in singing at the age of 18. I also got opportunities to sing for many devotional albums during those days.\n\nBriefly describe your music, growing up, why music became a part of your life / All details how your family, friends, teachers help or understand your musical talent\n\nIn my younger days, I mainly listened to whatever songs were played by my parents from Tamil films. In my school, I still remember I sang on stage when I was eight years old. My music teacher taught me the song “Thamizhukkum amudhendru per” to perform in front of the chief guest “Mr. Mannar Mannan” Son of Puratchi Kavignar Bharathidasan. At the end of my singing, the chief guest specially mentioned my name and appreciated my singing performance. Since then, my friends, and teachers have motivated me to participate in school events and sing many songs in front of a large audience. My close friend Rajashree’s father was a big motivation for me. He is the one person who motivated me to sing in many competitions conducted across the state.\n\nIn my younger days, when we watched songs on television, my father used to turn off the audio and ask me to sing the song. Though it was fun in my family, it has inspired me to sing playback. Once I turned a teen, I can say music almost became my life.\n\nWhat is music to you? or what does it mean to you?\n\n“Music is one of the most important and powerful things in my life. Music helps us to clean all of the dust from our minds and soul. The dust of stress, pain, worries, and tension everything is washed away with the gentle stream of music.”\n\nAre you classically trained? if not what are your thoughts on the importance of it\n\nYes, I have learned the basics of classical music when I was young. I have learned Carnatic music from my Guru Mrs. Meera Shankar. I am presently learning Carnatic music and Voice Culture from one of the best voxologist and voice trainers, Dr. Shyamala Vinod, who helped me a lot in improving my voice quality.\n\nClassical music is important for every musician and learning is a continuous process in life. It improves our skills, and intelligence and creates a unique talent in music. Classical music set’s framework for musicians. A talented classical musician has the power and skill to play any other type of music around the world. I feel very proud to get trained by my Gurus who have turned my music journey in a very positive way.\n\nWhat is your take on lyrics in the music? Your thoughts expand with examples.\n\nJanaki an ardent lover of music lyrics\n\nIf we know the meaning of the song, we can enjoy the emotions, thoughts, and feelings completely. It is true that one can find answers in lyrics for many situations in life. In many songs, we can see how a poet uses the lyrics to express the beauty of the language. Some good examples are in the Tamil film songs.\n\nIn “Ilayanila pozhigirathu” song Kavignar Vairamuthu his lyrics express reference to an event that happens naturally in a figurative way to human relations.\n\nMughilinangal alaigiradhey mugavarigal tholaindhanavo?\n\nMugavarigal tavirayadhal aludhidhumo adhu malaayo\n\nNeela vanile velli odaigal ooduginradhey enna jadhaigalo\n\nVinvivaliyil vidhaithadhuyaar navamanigal\n\n“The clouds are going in all directions..have they lost their addresses?\n\nHaving lost the address,will they cry, and is it the rain??\n\nThere are a lot of silver streams in the blue sky. What do they depict?\n\nWho sowed the 9 stones in the sky” ( Reference for a translation is from the following link http://itsallsrujana.blogspot.com/2008/12/rajas-miracleilayanila-thirst-that.html)\n\nIn “Vasantha kaala nathigalilae” song Kavignar Kannadasan arranged a game over lyrics based on the situation where the last word of a line is the beginning word of the next line\n\nVasantha kaala nathigalilae Vairamani neeralaigal\n\nNeeralaigal meethinilae Nenjirendin ninaivalaigal.\n\nNinaivalaigal thodarndhu vanthaal Neramellaam kanavalaigal\n\nKanavalaigal valarvatharku Kaamanavan malarkanaigal\n\nIn some other songs, Swaraksharam in Carnatic music is used as lyrics. For example, “Enna Samayalo” song,\n\n“Kari Kari Kari Kari Karikaaikalum Ingae”….\n\n“Saa|tha|maaha Thamathamaa”…..\n\n“Gama Gama Gama Gama Vaasam Varuthae”….\n\nLike this we have many songs in Tamil: “Kurangil irunthu piranthavan manithan”, “Neeye unakku endrum”, “Vendriduven Nadhathaal”\n\nThere are many songs in the Philosophy of life that is very well expressed in lyrics.\n\nFrom Nila Kaaigirathu song\n\n“Intha boomiyae poovanam Ungal pookkalai thedungal\n\nIntha vaazhkaiyae seethanam Ungal thevaiyai kelungal”\n\nVaazha Ninaithal Song Lyrics\n\n“Paarka Therindhaal paadhai Theriyum\n\npaarthu Nadandhaal payanam thodarum\n\nPayanam Thodarndhaal kadhavu Thirakum\n\nkadhavu Thirandhaal kaatchi kidaikum\n\nKaatchi Kidaithaal kavalai Theerum\n\nkavalai Theerndhaal vaazhalam”\n\nGood lyrics will always express the feel, emotions, Philosophy of life, and grammar of the language to us.\n\nGrowing up in Tamil Nadu how does the music of the state influence your music?\n\nYes, I am a proud Tamilian and I grew up in Tamil Nadu. Carnatic music (also known as Pannisai, which is a classical music form of Southern India ); is sung abundantly everywhere in the state, such as in temples, festivals, weddings, etc. December is our music season month, everyone can listen to a variety of music in Chennai, from upcoming singers to skilled talented, and popular singers. This has greatly influenced my music and knowledge as well as my interest in music.\n\nIf a music director finds you online and asks you to come on a video call for an interview what will be your reaction?\n\nIt will surely be a blessing moment in my life. I will share my inspiration for the music director’s compositions. I will try to understand what kind of singing skills the music director expects from a good singer. I will present a song by the music director and give my best performance.\n\nWhat are your career ambitions with music?\n\nMy career ambition with music is to become an aspiring singer, share my music knowledge with others, collaborate and learn a new style or genre in music, and explore improvisation\n\nIn five years from now, where do you see yourself and your music should be?\n\nI would like to improve my skills in teaching music. I want to teach both classical and film music. I also wish to hear my playback singing around the world. My voice in music should give at least five hit songs in the next five years.\n\nList all your music interests, like genres, male-female singers in both Hindi and regional languages, director\n\nMost of the music I sing is classical and film music melodies.\n\nI listen to tamil songs of artists like Dr. S P Balasubrahmanyam, Dr. K J Yesudas, Smt. P. Susheela, Smt. Shreya Ghoshal\n\nYour thoughts on ARR\n\nA great musician, Mozart of Madras. He integrated world music with traditional music arrangements and used the latest technology in his compositions. He is also an awesome singer with a unique and amazing vocal range.\n\nWho is your favorite Carnatic musician and why?\n\nShri.M.Balamuralikrishna is my favorite Carnatic singer because of his soft crooning voice along with his unique creativity in musical phrases. He used his great knowledge of voice culture in all of his songs.\n\nList all your favorite singers, and music directors and describe why or what are the things you like about them in detail.\n\nMy favorite music directors are Shri. M.S.Viswanathan, Isaignani Ilayaraja, and Shri. D. Imman.\n\nMost of their compositions are always unique. We can learn a lot from their difficult compositions. They always fully utilize the techniques and skills of a singer which is very evident from every successful song. People remember many of the hit songs of these music directors, but may not even remember the name of the film. Their music compositions and songs made many films successful.\n\nMy favorite singers:\n\nDr. S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Dr. K. J. Yesudas, Smt. P. Susheela, Smt. Shreya Ghoshal\n\nEvery singer is always unique, no doubt. I like these singers because of their god gifted voices. These singers have deep knowledge and a basic feel for the aesthetics of film music. Their respect for the art of singing is incomparable. The pronunciation, emotion & feel of lyrics in any language is always a great inspiration for any singer.\n\nJanaki’s recognitions\n\nI have participated in many inter-school, college, and Television music programs and won prizes. As I said earlier I had the pleasure to participate in many classical bhajans held at various famous temples and sabhas along with my colleagues.\n\nIn recent years, I got introduced to singing in Ganesh Kirupa’s Orchestra which is one of the best in Chennai. This paved the way to me to get many opportunities to sing along with Dr. S P Balasubrahmanyam, Smt. Vani Jairam, Smt. P. Susheela, Smt. L R Eshwari, Shri. Mano, Shri. Shankar Ganesh and Smt. Anuradha Sriram. Shri. Ganesh Kirupa offered a chance to sing with Dr. S. P. B. a song called “Illakkanam Marudho” which was the most appreciated performance of mine.\n\nI am singing in many shows conducted by famous veteran actor Shri. Yogee Mahendra. Also, playback singer Shri. Ananthu has been giving me many opportunities to sing in his mega shows.\n\nIn 2017, I was honored with the “Lifetime Achiever award” by Tamil Magazine.\n\nIn 2019, I was honored with the “Best Female Stage Singer” award which I am proud to say was received from the hands of Dr. S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Smt. Vani Jairam. This was a golden moment in my life.\n\nI am continuously singing in many TV shows conducted by Raj TV, Jaya TV, Kalaignar TV, Pudhu Yugam, and DD Podhigai.\n\n“I am thankful to all other musicians, friends, family, and many young friends who supported me to come up in my singing career. Without their support achieving this level for me is impossible. “\n\nHere are a few of her excellent singing hand-selected for this feature and sung and prepared specifically for the purpose of the feature. We can not stop praising Janaki’s professionalism; when she is given a task to present herself as a musician she works so hard to get there. A great quality that will definitely make her a playback-ready musician. Listen to her songs.\n\nEND WORDS\n\nWhen talking about Janaki Baala as a singer, and artist we want to use the utmost relative terms of praise. She is one of the finest artists Tamil stage shows have produced in current times. Her ability to sing the toughest songs made in Tamil film music and perform them live is true evidence of the greatness of this singer. It is with no doubt we all have witnessed her excellent voice and singing on this page itself. Another important aspect of Janaki is her never-ending enthusiasm for good music. Be it any genre or any modern song, she takes so much effort to sing it out as professionally as possible. We had been working on her song presentation and it was a very tedious process. Yet, she made such awesome careful efforts to record her songs before sending them. Janaki’s work ethic as a professional singer is superlative. We never had seen such high-quality professionalism in any singer we worked with so far except very few.\n\nJANAKI BAALA LIVE JAM – 10/04/2020- 9.00 pm IST\n\nWe wish her all the best for a bright and successful future and she will be coming on a Live Jam session through KKJlive My Favorite co-singers next weekend, on Sunday 4th of October IST at 9.00 pm. Singers who wish to join her Live Jam for a pre-arranged session we call Talent Showcase Live Jams, please send in requests to Janaki on her Smule profile. Once again a big thanks to all our peers who stand hand in hand from the Smule India community, A big thanks from the heart.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIntroduction\n\nA big thanks to many peers whose enthusiastic help in screening many talents from the state of Andra Pradesh, Pradip Soman Sir, Harika Peddibhotla and Dr. Swetha of Melomanies. We finally have two female (confirmed) and two male (tentative) candidates finalized from the state’s very competitive, classically trained talent pool. Priya Pidaparty, was a candidate whose talent and music experiences stood outstanding and a class apart from many singers irrespective of any state from India.\n\nA talent that was nurtured from a very young age itself by family, teachers and friends went onto get recognition for her talent starting from Balabharathi title, from prestigious Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal, to S. P. Balasubramoniam sir’s prestigious “Padutha theeyaga” performances and a win on such shows are well enough endorsements for Priya in India’s music scene. This is almost a year of waiting before this feature materialized, yet we are excited beyond words to bring this phenomenal talent to our readers. Priya as always was very unassuming and down to earth personality.\n\nHere is her insta page link https://www.instagram.com/singer_priya_pidaparty/\n\nOn YouTube you will find her here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXSFsgZM2j5-oVjbH5QN3mA/featured\n\nPlease introduce yourself and walk us through your initial interactions with music, all about your family and how did they found your talent?\n\n“Priya Pidaparty, that is my name, is a native of Andhrapradesh, exactly from the great city of Kakinada (a city famous for delicious India’s Donuts called Khaja). My family includes my dad, mom, and an older sister. As far as music in my family concerned, none of my parents are serious singers. My father by profession is a public servant, he loves singing. I guess my genes for singing come from him. My mom is a homemaker, who listens to music a lot on her radio always as I have seen her growing up.”\n\n“I started my music very early in my life. My very first memories of singing are at around age two. I started singing whatever I listened to, to my dad, that is what my parents say. In the family, other proper singing talent is my sister. At home, we were fortunate that my dad played and sing legendary Ghantasala songs when I was a child. Later Raja sir hits were played all the time, along. I am very much influenced by these two music legends. One thing that really made me a singer is the encouragement from my family members and neighbors. I didn’t realize how I sing or anything, all I can remember is that they all were quite surprised seeing me singing at that young age. So my parents decided to enroll my sister and myself in music classes. My first guru was Smt. Suseela Rani. My sister joined formally, she was around 6 yrs age at that time. My guru was kind enough to allow me to sit in the classes, despite the fact that I was only three years of old. That’s where my musical journey began.”\n\nNow looking back after several years of learning Carnatic music at a young age and later as an adult what are your thoughts about the learning process?\n\n“That is a very interesting question. When I was that young all I did was learn Carnatic as any other music. I did not know the details of each composition or anything. But as an adult my learning process was deeper, realizing how much of a genius all these compositions. All of our legends wrote music with such genius that they knew writing music based on a system ( it is so scientific genius behind it) will preserve the exact notation it is meant to be sung no matter how many years go by. Every note, every detail that is tied to a system of numbers and style; I am awed by the vast knowledge behind these compositions. Every day, I am realizing how much less of it that I understand about Carnatic.” Priya stops for a while overwhelmed by the thoughts.\n\nPriya had a very interesting growing up, where she said her dad got a transfer from Hyderabad to Cochin in the state of Kerala. That brought all of her family to an entire different language and culture in the southern state. First, for her it was mentally a lot of stress thinking of losing her music class, school and friends. But she says the day they reached Cochin there were employee association festivals going on. All of her dad’s friends from work came to have the sisters sing and compete. Priya says the kind of culture she had the pleasure of witnessing in Kerala surprised her. Coming from a state that is filled with so many Carnatic education institutions , Kerala equally had so much enthusiasm for Carnatic as she witnessed back home. She is a proud Alumni of Cochin’s unique music and arts center called Fr. Abel’s Cochin Kalabhavan, that produced many film celebrities of India (Alma mater) (Established by a CMI Priest, Fr. Abel, whose love for Kerala’s music and arts and its nurture was his priority like his commitment to priesthood. Sujatha, Jency, Minmini and many more famous musicians came from this institute).\n\nDescribe your classical music training and all about your teachers\n\nI joined my first music classes in Hyderabad at the age of three .The only way I could learn was by listening and watching my guru singing, as I cannot go with notes. This was an advantage to me, which I realized later. Whatever, my guru asks as part of the recap, I was the only student who could answer without referring to books. From then, she took my learning seriously; she used to teach advanced lessons to both of us sisters with special interest. Atathala Varnas (one of the most complex basic Thalas), raga Malikaas, complex thalas like khanda chapu etc are few examples of lessons I got at the age of five itself.\n\nA huge recognition ‘Balabharathi‘ at young age\n\nMy guru also enrolled my name for an exam conducted by Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal, which include both theory and practical exams. I passed practical exams with high scores from my institute (Balabharathi), but couldn’t pass theory as I was too young to write. My guru was very happy about my success. I could pursue my music from her, till the age of nine, until my father had a transfer of his job to Kerala. Later, I could continue my music under the guidance of various gurus as Smt. Sathi, Sri. Divakaran, Smt. Hemalatha (Kalabhavan). Started learning violin from Sri. Vaikom Salim Kumar (Kalabhavan).\n\nYou had an interesting life growing up as your parents happen to live in two different states and you are influenced a lot by Kerala culture. How did you like it? or do you feel out of place always growing up in a different state?\n\nOf course, initially it was really tough to adjust to a completely new environment, language, people, culture. Later, I was really comfortable and felt at home; I must say it is because, I started admiring my way of living in Cochin. I felt very close to nature; all the love from people around me, all the support from my friends to make me understand the language. My friends used to teach me Malayalam investing their time and efforts, so that I could sing Malayalam songs for them. I can proudly say, I am a Malayali too, because listening to my Malayalam, people around me never believe that I am from Andhra. I feel Malayalam is a beautiful language, which added beauty to my life. My passion towards this language, made me win many Malayalam light and cine music competitions. I won the prestigious title “Voice of AIMA” conducted by All India Malayali Association at Bangalore in the year 2014.\n\nAlso I want to add an experience about my first guru from Kerala Mrs. Sathi, who encouraged me a lot in learning Malayalam songs like Valampiri churul mudi, a light music originally sung by G.Venugopal sir and still other beautiful songs like Karnikara theerangal etc, as part of competition preparation. This song is very special for me because I won many Malayalam light music competitions, singing this number.\n\nClassical music be it either carnatic or hindustani, in this time and age of India’s music how relevant are these age old traditional music?\n\n“According to me, both carnatic or hindustani resembles alphabets in a language, of which we form words and sentences to express our emotions. So the foundation is always important, at any age or time no one can deny the importance of it. It is not necessary that one can only sing if he / she learns classical. But learning the basics will help a singer to get better grip on their rendition. India’s music is built on our classical raagas and traditions and it is the uniqueness of it that amazes all of us.”\n\nWhy do you think we have to value our traditions and culture when western life and its influences take a lot of prominence in modern life in India? or if you think otherwise also say why?\n\n“Traditions and culture are nothing but bundles of experience from ages. We follow the footsteps of our elders to avoid accidents in our lives. Normally, humans intend to introduce a change in their lives. So they adopt new lifestyles such as western to eastern and vice versa. I respect all the other traditions until their implementation doesn’t harm anything that I value. When, I was young I always copied or imitated what I heard in my classical music classes. At around age ten that is when I realized the meaning of raagas and started learning manodharma. I also learned to play violin and many other instruments. I must say learning an instrument made my understanding of each swaras and its place etc. Each note stands for each swaras and so on.\n\nAre you a socially responsible artist? If so how would that be like provided you are an influential singer in India?\n\n“Music heals one’s soul. Many of my friends, listeners convey that they feel refreshed listening to me. Some even request me to sing a particular song, which may help heal them. Then I realized that my singing can bring positive vibes to many. This is one way I can say my music is sued in a socially responsible way. My music finds a purpose always, through making an impact on its listener through my voice and singing and rendition. I think that is my social commitment.”\n\nWhat is your take on world music? Do you sing any world music?\n\n“I do listen to different styles of music around the globe. Few styles that I like and listen to are Western, Arabian and Spanish. Tried attempting some western English songs and I enjoy it because I know the meaning. I also enjoy mixing up some western into relevant classical numbers.”\n\nWhat does your music mean to you?\n\n“Music never fails in showing me the presence of God. Music heals me in ways I can’t describe and people around me as well. For me music is pure, it reminds me of the pure love that we all experience and share to many in one’s life. Music can change our minds. I believe that good music always helps in good living. It energizes me.”\n\nHow do you go about choosing a song to sing? Any thoughts before you attempt a song?\n\n“Choosing songs will depend on the audience for whom I perform. Before attempting any song, I try to go through the mood and the meaning of the song normally. Knowing the meaning of the song is my first priority. Once we grab the meaning, it will be easy to get the mood out of it. We can get involved in a song only through its mood.”\n\nDo you listen to any music other than film songs? If so, what type of music do you listen to?\n\n“I am interested in listening to carnatic concerts, devotional concerts, Fusions, ghazals and sufi singing. Also I listen to contemporary classical concerts and western symphonies.”\n\nWhat is your career ambition as far as your music?\n\n“One of my ambitions was to participate in a prestigious reality show running since twenty four years in Telugu called “Padutha Theeyaga” judged by SPB sir. That wish has been successfully achieved and I am blessed to win the title in the year 2015. Going forward I aim to prove myself as a professional singer in the film industry. Wish to sing the compositions of many renowned composers. Love to experiment with various compositions. Also I am in the process of new compositions, Slokas and chantings. I am also very passionate about learning programming with Digital Audio Workstation.\n\nDreaming Big\n\nIn five years from now where do you want to be as far as music is concerned?\n\n“I feel that a composer can understand a composer better than anyone. I feel that It is not just enough to be a singer alone. A singer can only become a professional, if they have a composer in them. My goal is to be a quick learner as a singer with creative composition skills as well. I wish I could be a most justified playback singer and perform live shows across the world.”\n\nDo you think at this time one can pursue a career as Carnatic or Hindustani vocalist?\n\n“Learning carnatic vocals and making it as a career option is a good choice in my opinion at any time. This can take you to choose two options again. As a profession either we can teach music or utilize the knowledge for self improvement. I feel, for any singing, the importance goes to the audience who listens to you. We need to mold our skills according to the taste of the listeners to be successful in our career.”\n\nWestern music: what is your experience singing of both styles (Western and India music?)\n\n“Western music is a way of expression I can say, just like India’s music. The difference I found is using chord progression, which is a brilliant concept. It adds a lot of life to the song. Indian classical compositions are raaga based. Also we use gamakas in our rendition much more than western vibrato. The way of singing differs in the way we express the emotion and the backbone of the expression is definitely dependent on the culture we grew up in.”\n\nPlease do list all your favorite singers music directors both in classical music and playback or any other styles you listen to: singing, music director male/ female give examples and explain why they are your favorites\n\nFavorite singers in Cine industry\n\nMale\n\nSri Ghantasala– Voice weightage, broad pitch spectrum and great composer.
