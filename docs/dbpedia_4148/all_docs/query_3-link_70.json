        "text": "Gang,\n\nCould someone give some encouraging words?\n\nI will have to take class for freshers who joined my company recently.The thing is that I have a phobia talking infront of the crowd (stagefear), that too about a subject which I am not familiar with. The worst thing is this is not the first time I am taking classes, I have been doing this for the couple of years.\n\nIn a way, I feel good that I have been asked to do continuously forthe third year but stupid me, everytime I feel like I am taking class for the first time and I am SCARED. me restless since I got the calendar request from the HR.\n\nAhhhhh...please someone respond to this polambalsss.\n\nI know this is a good oppurtunity etc etc, even then I feel bad, scared :'( :'(\n\nTook another class today (for 1 hr) to the same group and I dont feel comfortable with the audience. That made my mood still worse. How would I take class for the whole dayyyy with this kind of ppl.\n\nLast year it was a polite batch (they left me comfortable even when they asked questions). but today, ppl seemed to be soo harsh and asked so many things in a rude way...I did answer them for whatever questions I could and asked them to refer something for few questions....dont know, they sounded rude to me atleast :'(:'(\n\nJ."
