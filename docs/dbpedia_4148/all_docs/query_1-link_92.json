        "text": "It was in 1986 when the late Ramanaidu was pursuing superstar Krishna to launch a new film under the Suresh Productions banner. The ever-busy superstar, who could not arrange the dates for Ramanaidu, advised him to cast his younger son who was studying in the US. Taking it seriously, Ramanaidu immediately summoned his son from the US.\n\nVenkatesh’s tryst with acting\n\nWhen Ramanaidu experimented with his younger son in K Raghavendra Rao’s Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986), Venkatesh’s naive face on the screen startled everyone. Although he practised the lines much before the shooting, Venkatesh couldn’t deliver as expected thus leaving everyone on the sets disappointed.\n\nHowever, the film was completed on time with the help of other crew and cast.\n\nWhen Venkatesh resolved to give up acting and get into the family business of film production, his debut film turned out to be a blockbuster at the box office. Praise poured in for his performance. The movie also won a Nandi Special Jury Award.\n\nAlso Read: Makers of ‘Salaar’ drop the first single — ‘Soorede Godugu Patti’\n\nA star in making\n\nJubilant over the success, he started signing more flicks within no time.\n\nFilms like Brahma Rudrulu (1986), Ajeyudu (1987), Bharatamlo Arjunudu (1987), Trimurtulu (1987), Vijetha Vikram (1987), Srinivasa Kalyanam (1987), Raktha Tilakam (1988), Brahma Puthrudu (1988), Swarna Kamalam (1988), and Varasudochadu (1988) were all proved to be a major success in just two years.\n\nSwarna Kamalam which came in the direction of K Viswanath happens to be the classic of that era. The film also won Nandi Award for the second time in two years.\n\nPrema, which came in the year 1989, achieved a cult status. Dhruva Nakshatram, which was released in the same year, was also a mass hit at the box office.\n\nBobbili Raja broke the all-time records at the Telugu box office in 1990.\n\nFilms like Coolie No.1 (1991) and Kshana Kshanam (1991) catapulted him to stardom on par with the then superstars of the Telugu cinema — Megastar Chiranjeevi, Nandamuri Balakrishna, and Akkineni Nagarjuna.\n\nChanti (1992), a remake of the Tamil flick Chinna Thambi (1991), was another box-office hit. It earned him massive box office collections. Venkatesh, as an innocent servant named Chanti, was raved about by audiences.\n\nChanti was later remade in Hindi as Anari (1993), only to receive more praise from Hindi audiences.\n\nImmediately, he showed a different variation in Chinarayudu (1993).\n\nAlso Read: Cinema is no more a medium to deliver a social message: Srinivas Avasarala\n\nVersatile roles\n\nHis on-screen charisma and versatile performances gave him success in films starting from the early 90s to the late 2000s, swiftly catapulting him into the limelight.\n\nSundarakanda (1992), Kondapalli Raja (1993), Abbaigaru (1993), Muddula Priyudu (1994), Dharma Chakram (1996), Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu (1996), and Pavithra Bandham (1996) — have all scripted history.\n\nBecause of his successful run at the box office with a stupendous success rate, bearing a few flops, film circles started calling him “Victory” Venkatesh.\n\nEven at the age of 62, his action-hero looks would hold as much attention as any other celebrity currently ruling Tollywood. For instance, in the Netflix series Rana Naidu, he mesmerised the audience by playing the father of his real-life nephew Rana Daggubati. Their on-screen chemistry left the viewers wanting for more.\n\nHere’s wishing “Victory” Venkatesh many more victories and happiest birthdays!"
