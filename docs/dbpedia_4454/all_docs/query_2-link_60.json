        "text": "Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is one of the most interesting cities to visit in Europe (that I’m also lucky to call home). Besides enjoying all the great things to do in Warsaw, you can also use the city as a base to see some of the best places to visit in Poland.\n\nEven if the options are less exciting than in other popular Polish destinations – Krakow, Gdansk, or Wroclaw – there are some great day trips from Warsaw you can take and see some of the best attractions in Poland.\n\nI compiled a list of great Warsaw day trips you can take when visiting the city. Some might seem a bit far away, but with fast train connections (that you can check here), they are definitely doable and worth visiting. And if you still have any questions about visiting Warsaw, join my Facebook group and ask there.\n\nBest day trips from Warsaw\n\nAnd now, without any further ado, here are the best day trips from Warsaw (with the distance, best ways to get there, and recommended tours).\n\nKampinos National Park\n\nOn the outskirts of Warsaw, you will find Kampinos National Park, a perfect nature getaway from Warsaw. This is one of the 23 national parks in Poland (and the second-largest one), established in 1959 and holding the title of the UNESCO biosphere reserves since 2000.\n\nKampinos National Park is a beautiful ancient forest, home to numerous protected species, including elks, lynx, and bison.\n\nThe best way to get there is by car. Still, you can also use public transport that will take you to the park’s borders, where you can start a hike on one of many trails to enjoy the tranquility and beauty of the place.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 15 km\n\nHow to get there: car or bus\n\nŻelazowa Wola\n\nAs you might know, Frédéric Chopin – one of the greatest Poles in history – was born not far from Warsaw. Even if you can visit numerous places connected to him in the capital, it is worth going for one of the Warsaw day trips to Żelazowa Wola and see where he was born.\n\nThe charming manor house is now home to the museum dedicated to the great composer. However, it is not an original building as that burned down in 1812, two years after Chopin was born. Inside you will find some artifacts from the early 19th century, showing the reality of life back then. Everything is neat, organized, and accompanied by Chopin’s music playing in the background.\n\nThe manor house is surrounded by a beautiful park that is best visited in spring when all the trees and flowers bloom or in autumn when leaves change colors.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 50 km\n\nHow to get there: car or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nFryderyk Chopin’s Birthplace Half Day Private Tour from Warsaw\n\nBirth Place of Frederic Chopin – Żelazowa Wola – 3 Hours\n\nFrederic Chopin Private Tour in Warsaw and Zelazowa Wola with lunch\n\nLublin\n\nLublin – one of the most beautiful yet underrated cities in Poland is located only less than two hours away from the capital and is a perfect destination for one of the day trips from Warsaw (although it deserves more time, sometimes a day is all you have).\n\nThis is one of the most important places in Polish history, with numerous crucial events happening here over the centuries (such as the union creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569 that was signed in Lublin). With such a long past, you can expect numerous monuments around, and you will find them, but the list of things to do in Lublin is much more extensive.\n\nThe city is simply beautiful, and strolling around the old town and its charming, cobbled lanes is a pure pleasure. You will also notice numerous quirks, great street art around, and references to Lublin’s past that wasn’t always easy.\n\nOnce you get tired of all the sightseeing, you can sit in one of the many great restaurants and enjoy the local cuisine. This place really is a gem and deserves so much more attention than it gets; be sure to put Lublin in your Poland itinerary!\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 170 km\n\nHow to get there: car, train, or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nMajdanek Concentration Camp & Lublin Full Day Private Tour from Warsaw\n\nLublin and Majdanek concentration camp from Warsaw (1-day tour)\n\nLublin and Majdanek Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nRead more about Lublin:\n\n9 Reasons to Visit Lublin, Poland – One of the Best Cities in the Central Europe\n\n17 Amazing Things to Do in Lublin, Poland\n\nKazimierz Dolny\n\nEven if this lovely town is located not far from Lublin, I wouldn’t recommend combining them as one day trip from Warsaw as both places separately offer enough attractions for at least one day.\n\nThis small historic town is known as the mecca for artists but is so much more than just its charming, bohemian vibe and picturesque cobbled lanes. With its long history, dating back to the 11th century, and beautiful surroundings, there are so many great things to do in Kazimierz Dolny.\n\nYou can see some of the amazing monuments, including impressive townhouses, numerous stunning churches, and the ruins of the castle. You can hike in one of the picturesque gorges surrounding the town. Or you can wander around and enjoy the laid-back vibe. In the meantime, do some shopping as in Kazimierz Dolny, you can find unique handicraft souvenirs.\n\nNo matter what you decide to do when visiting Kazimierz Dolny, you are in for a treat as it’s one of the most charming towns in Central Europe that are so easy to fall for.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 150 km\n\nHow to get there: car, bus, or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nKazimierz Dolny Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nFull-Day Kazimierz Dolny Private Tour from Warsaw with Guide\n\nRead more about Kazimierz Dolny: Visit Kazimierz Dolny, Poland – the Charming, Historical Town\n\nŁódź\n\nWith numerous daily train connections and a travel time of around one hour and a half, Łódź is one of the most accessible day trips from Warsaw.\n\nFor years the city has been misunderstood, but that’s what makes it unique. After the industry collapsed here in the 1990s, Łódź had to reinvent itself, and now this is the alternative and creative center of Poland, with plenty to do and see.\n\nThere are some amazing townhouses and palaces (some of which you can visit inside to see stunning interiors), one of the best street art scenes in Poland, and numerous former industrial buildings that serve as cultural institutions now.\n\nŁódź is different from any other city in Poland, which is its advantage. You should consider adding this place to your itinerary, even for a short one-day trip, to see more than beautiful old towns and better understand Poland.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 130 km\n\nHow to get there: car, train, or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nŁódź – 1-day tour to the most surprising Polish city (from Warsaw)\n\nLodz Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nRead more about Łódź: Lodz – the alternative and creative center of Poland\n\nMalbork\n\nDid you know that the largest castle in the world (measured by land area) is located in Poland, only a bit over 2 hours away by train from Warsaw? Malbork Castle, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, used to be the capital of the Teutonic Order and still is considered the largest Gothic fortress in Europe.\n\nThe works on it started in 1278, and still today, you can admire the impressive architecture of the place. This is one of a kind castle, and during your visit, your jaw will drop a few times for sure. The whole area is huge, and you will need at least a few hours to see everything Malbork Castle offers.\n\nThe most efficient way to get there from Warsaw is by train; the train station is a 15-minute walk away from the castle.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 310 km\n\nHow to get there: train or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nGdansk and Malbork Castle Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nThe Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork – 1 DAY TRIP FROM WARSAW\n\nRead more about Malbork: Visiting Malbork Castle, Poland – the Largest Castle in the World\n\nGdansk\n\nOne of the best places to visit in Poland and the most important cities on the Baltic Sea shore, it deserves at least a few days of exploration. Still, if you are short on time, you can see the most important Gdansk highlights in one day too.\n\nGdansk is well-connected by train with Warsaw, with departures at least once an hour and travel time under three hours (on the way, you can admire the impressive structure of Malbork Castle since it’s located next to the railway line). There are so many amazing things to do in Gdansk, but since the Old Town is close to the central train station and many attractions are not far from each other, you can easily enjoy some of the best of what Gdansk has to offer in a day.\n\nWander around the Old Town and its picturesque streets as well as along the Motlawa riverside to see the most important landmarks of the city: the Town Hall, the Neptune’s Fountain, Artus Court, or the Crane. Step inside one of the beautiful churches and look at the city from above from one of the viewpoints. And visit one of the museums telling the history not only of Gdansk but of the world (did you know that World War 2 and the Solidarity movement started here?).\n\nGdansk has a lot to offer; even if you only have one busy day here, you will not regret visiting it.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 340 km\n\nHow to get there: train or tour\n\nRecommended tour: Gdansk and Malbork Castle Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nRead more about Gdansk: 19 Amazing Things to Do in Gdansk, Poland\n\nAuschwitz\n\nThis place needs no introduction, but I believe visiting Auschwitz is one of the must things to do in Poland. It’s definitely not an easy place to tour. However, even if you know the history and what happened there, you still should go there, and most likely, this trip will not leave you indifferent. Auschwitz is a bit away from Warsaw, but doable as a day trip.\n\nDuring your Auschwitz tour, you will visit two parts of the largest Nazi Germany concentration and extermination camp during World War II. First, you will see Auschwitz I, where the infamous gate with the sign “Arbeit macht frei” (meaning “Work Sets You Free”) is located. This is also where you will visit numerous barracks where inmates were kept – now you can see different exhibitions there, showing the reality of Auschwitz and halls with personal belongings taken from arriving prisoners – luggage, shoes, glasses, etc., or hair of Victims. You will learn all about cruel practices here, including medical experiments or torture.\n\nAfter visiting Auschwitz, you will be taken to Auschwitz II-Birkenau, where around 90% of victims died. This is a vast area where you will walk around and see remnants of the largest killing factory in the world, with ruins of four gas chambers and crematoriums, as well as barracks.\n\nAltogether, the visit to Auschwitz takes around 3,5 hours of the guided tour, after which you will return to Warsaw. The journey back will be a good opportunity to work through your thoughts and impressions of visiting Auschwitz.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 350 km\n\nHow to get there: car or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nFrom Warsaw Auschwitz and Krakow one day tour by train with pick up and drop off\n\nOne day tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau from Warsaw with private transport\n\nRead more about Auschwitz: Visiting Auschwitz – How to Plan the Auschwitz Tour\n\nKrakow\n\nKrakow is the most popular tourist destination in Poland, and it gets all the attention for a reason. The city is simply stunning and packed with attractions and historical monuments (it was the capital of Poland for a few centuries in medieval times). But even if you have only one day there, you still can see a lot.\n\nThere are frequent trains from Warsaw to Krakow, the fastest ones will take you there in under three hours. The train station is located on the edge of the UNESCO-listed Old Town, from where you can start exploring Krakow.\n\nGranted, having only one day in Krakow will keep you busy, but you can see all its highlights: the Old Town with the Main Square, the Wawel Castle, and Kazimierz – the Jewish district. Once you are tired of all the sightseeing, you can sit down in one of the many cafes or restaurants (the best ones are in Kazimierz) and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of the place before heading back to Warsaw.\n\nDistance from Warsaw: 290 km\n\nHow to get there: train, car, or tour\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nFrom Warsaw Auschwitz and Krakow one day tour by train with pick up and drop off\n\nKrakow and Wieliczka Small Group Tour from Warsaw with Lunch\n\nKrakow – Full Day Tour from Warsaw by private car\n\nRead more about Krakow: 37 Amazing Things to Do in Krakow, Poland\n\nOther, less popular, ideas for Warsaw day trips\n\nThe places mentioned above are the best and most popular options for day trips from Warsaw. Still, there are numerous smaller destinations that are worth visiting, too, especially if you are looking for more off-the-path places. Here are some of them:\n\nŻyrardów (50 km away) – in the 19th century, it was a bustling town; today, the city is home to almost 300 monuments, many of them a testimony of the industrial past. Żyrardów and its factory settlement is the only place in Europe where you can see an industrial city’s fully preserved urban complex from the 19th/early 20th centuries.\n\nOtwock (25 km away) – a former spa town, home to numerous beautiful wooden houses built in a distinctive style – Świdermajer.\n\nModlin (40 km away) – dating back to the early 19th century, this is one of the largest and best-preserved fortresses in Poland, located at the confluence of Vistula, Narew, and Wkra rivers.\n\nPłock (130 km away) – the former capital of Poland (in the years 1079–1138), a pleasant city with numerous historical monuments, such as the Cathedral, Ducal Castle, and more.\n\nEthnographic Open-Air Museum in Maurzyce (95 km away) – one of the most colorful museums of that kind in Poland, with over 40 historical buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries\n\nBaroque Palace in Nieborów and Romantic Park in Arkadia (80 km away)\n\nCzersk Castle (40 km away) – ruins of the Gothic castle from the 14th century, the seat of the Masovian Dukes.\n\nPodlasie region (around 200 km away) – known as Poland’s most idyllic and authentic part, with beautiful wooden architecture, small Orthodox churches, and Białowieża National Park, home of the bison.\n\nOlsztyn (200 km away) – a getaway to the Masurian Lake District, home to the Gothic Castle where Nicolaus Copernicus spent five years working.\n\nBialystok (200 km away) – the largest city in north-east Poland, known especially for the stunning Branicki Palace and gardens, with a great street art scene and still visible multicultural past.\n\nTreblinka (110 km away) – a former Nazi Germany work and extermination camp where almost 800 thousand people lost their lives.\n\nFinal thoughts on day trips from Warsaw\n\nAs you can see above, you can visit many diverse places on day trips from Warsaw. While some cities, like Krakow, Gdansk, or Lublin, might need a few days of proper exploration, you still can see a lot there in one day only if you have little time in your Poland itinerary. But no matter what you choose, you are in for a treat, as Poland has a lot to offer!\n\nFurther reading\n\nI published many articles about Poland that you might find useful when planning your trip there.
