        "text": "The article analyzes the professional standards of training of informatics and mathematics teachers in Poland and Ukraine and conducts a thorough analysis of the results of a survey of education seekers in Poland and Ukraine in areas of professional training. The survey was conducted in 2019/2020 in the following institutions of higher education of Ukraine—Kamianets-Podilskyi National University named after Ivan Ohienko, Rivne State Pedagogical University, Ternopil State Pedagogical University named after Volodymyr Hnatyuk. Students of the IV course of full-time education for the educational and qualification level “bachelor” of the educational program 014.09 Secondary education (mathematics, informatics), 014 Secondary education specialization 014.04 “Mathematics” with additional specialization “Informatics” and students studying under a shortened term of study were involved., who entered the second or third year based on the educational and qualification level junior specialist. In Poland, students from Cardinal Stefan Wyszenski University in Warsaw and Maria Curie-Skłodowska University in Lublin were responsible for full-time education, majoring in “Mathematics” and “Informatics for Teachers”. The answers were concentrated around the following questions: “What guided you when choosing a profession (choose. There may be several of your decisions)”; “Choose the types of additional scholarships for higher education students that, in your opinion, will contribute to encouraging learning and mastering new knowledge and practices” and “Which subjects would you add to the list of those to be studied in higher education to obtain the specialty of “informatics teacher”. The survey was conducted through Google-forms. The results of the study revealed discrepancies in the answers, caused, according to the authors, by the following factors: Poland's entry into the European Union and the establishment of educational programs in accordance with European standards of bachelor's training; foresight and the need to study new and promising disciplines related to computer science teaching methods, didactics, entrepreneurship, logic in computer science, programming, able to write projects with the aim of obtaining grants from the European Union."
