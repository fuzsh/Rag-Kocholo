        "text": "The first Jewish settlement to be called a ghetto was established in Venice in 1516. This ghetto was extremely different from the places that we now – following the Holocaust – associate with the word ghetto.\n\nIn Venice, Jews from the nearby mainland were granted refuge in Venice after fleeing from a besieging army. Prior to this point, an organised Jewish community had not been permitted to exist in the city. After granting refuge to Jews, the leaders of the city ordered that they must live on a single island, known as the Ghetto Nuovo, or the new ghetto. Whilst very different to the Nazi ghettos, the ghetto in Venice was still extremely cramped and overcrowded, and the residents lacked freedom of movement.\n\nAlthough this is the first recorded incident of a Jewish settlement being called a ghetto, it was not the first Jewish settlement that was confined to a specific area in a town or city by authorities. Jewish settlements, confined to specific areas, had existed for years prior to this point but had been named differently, such as ‘Jewish Quarter’.\n\nDespite this, the word ‘ghetto’ soon caught on, and new settlements termed ‘ghettos’ were established in Ragusa in 1546 and Rome in 1555. These ghettos primarily existed to ensure that Jews and other occupants of the city remained segregated . This added to growing antisemitic stereotypes prevalent at the time.\n\nNew ghettos continued to be established across Italy until the end of the eighteenth century. By the early nineteenth century, the term ghetto had become common across Western Europe. Ghettos for Jews were established in places like Frankfurt and Prague as well.\n\nFollowing the Enlightenment, ghettos across Europe were legally abolished as Jews gained equal rights for the first time, including the freedom to live wherever they pleased. However, despite ghettos no longer existing as physical places in pre-war Europe, the idea of them, who they held, and what they represented, remained. As the Polish Journalist Bernard Singer wrote about pre-war Warsaw ‘There were no drawbridges or guards at its borders; the ghetto had been abolished long before, but nevertheless there still existed an invisible wall which separated the [Jewish] quarter from the rest of the city’ [Bernard Singer, Moje Nalewki, (Warsaw: Czytelnik, 1993), p.7].\n\nThe use of the term ghetto soon also spread as a derogatory way to refer to other non-Jewish, unenclosed, communities and settlements. One example can be seen in the United States of America where the term ghetto was used to describe spaces where communities of African-American people had settled in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nThe Nazis’ use of ghettos following the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 changed the perception of ghettos forever. The Nazis used ghettos to confine, exploit, and persecute the Jews of Poland and eastern Europe. Thousands of people lost their lives to the inhumane conditions inside the ghettos, and millions more died following the ghettos’ liquidation and the transportation of Jews to extermination camps.\n\nInvasion of Poland and the Madagascar Plan\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland in September 1939, three million Jews came under Nazi control. This presented a problem for the Nazis, as they wanted their newly acquired land to be free of Jews in line with their antisemitic beliefs. In response, the Nazis segregated the Jews from the rest of the population, and ghettos were developed to forcibly detain them.\n\nThese ghettos were initially thought of as temporary holding spaces. The Nazis initial plan to remove Jews from Poland was to deport all Jews to the island of Madagascar. This was called the Magagascar Plan .\n\nThe establishment of ghettos\n\nOn 21 September 1939, Reinhard Heydrich issued an order to the chiefs of the Einsatzgruppen known as the Schnellbrief. This order stated that Jews in Poland were to be concentrated in large towns and cities near railway lines. The order also declared that councils of Jewish Leaders were to be set up to administer the newly uprooted Jewish communities.\n\nAs steps were taken to concentrate Jews in towns and cities, the problem emerged of what to do with the Jews when they arrived. Whilst Heydrich’s order detailed generally where to concentrate Jews (in towns and cities with railway access), it did not detail where in each town Jews would then live, or how they would reestablish life there. These decisions were left to the local authorities and Jewish Councils that had been set up in towns. Each local authority improvised and responded to this problem differently. As a result, no two ghettos were the same.\n\nOn 8 October 1939, the first ghetto was opened at Piotrków. This was soon followed by the ghetto in Radomsko on 20 December 1939, and the first major ghetto in Łódź in February 1940. Over the following two years, hundreds of ghettos would be established across Poland.\n\nAbandonment of the Madagascar Plan and the ‘Final Solution’\n\nBy September 1940, Britain’s remaining naval superiority meant that the Magagascar Plan became regarded as unfeasible and indefinitely postponed. This development meant that the ghettos became more permanent features of the Nazi occupation.\n\nHowever, this was not the Nazis’ intention. As the invasion of the Soviet Union brought millions more Jews under Nazi rule, the question of what to do with the Jews segregated in ghettos across Poland became more pressing. The decision was made to start exterminating racially undesirable groups. To coordinate this decision, a conference was called in January 1942. This conference was held in a suburb of Berlin, called Wannsee, and became known as the Wannsee Conference.\n\nThe Jewish Councils were elected by the local population and made up of influential or high profile Jews and Rabbis from the community.\n\nThe Councils were responsible for tasks such as transferring Jews from their homes to ghettos, maintaining order and discipline within the ghetto, and issuing food rations. Sometimes the councils tried to reduce the effect of the Nazis’ measures by obtaining and distributing illegal supplies of food. To relieve suffering within the ghetto they also often established charitable organisations such as orphanages, hospitals, surgeries and mutual aid societies.\n\nThe councils were also responsible for jobs such as providing an internal police force for the ghetto, providing workers for forced labour and supplying names of Jews to be deported to camps in the east.\n\nWhilst the councils sought to be benevolent , they were in a difficult position. Any SS demands that were not complied with resulted in serious sanctions, which could endanger not only the council members but the population of the ghetto as a whole. The morally difficult decisions made by the Jewish Councils inevitably took a toll on their members, and many resigned or committed suicide rather than carry out the tasks required of them by the SS.\n\nLife inside the ghettos was extremely difficult, and, for many, conditions were deadly.\n\nHousing\n\nAs huge populations were forced into small areas, several families were forced to share each house. In the Warsaw Ghetto an average of just over seven people shared a room. This overcrowding, coupled with a lack of clean running water and proper sewage systems, resulted in poor sanitation and rampant disease.\n\nFood and medicine\n\nMedical supplies were sparse and, after many ghettos were sealed and cut off from the outside world, quickly ran out altogether.\n\nFood supplies were extremely sparse to the point that many ghetto inhabitants quickly died of starvation. To try and alleviate this situation people went to great lengths to smuggle food into the ghetto. If caught, they faced death.\n\nWork\n\nAfter having lost their businesses and normal forms of employment, most people in the ghettos had no regular source of income. This led to a thriving black market , where people attempted to exchange possessions for their everyday needs.\n\nAs the ghettos became more established, the Nazis sometimes used inhabitants for forced labour.\n\nWork in each ghetto differed. Inhabitants could be used for anything from construction work to making clothes. Forced labourers worked extremely long hours in brutal conditions. Some work was used as a form of torture rather than for productivity, although most work did attempt to productively use the free labour, typically for the war effort.\n\nFor some Jews, work offered a temporary lifeline, as those who were being used for labour often received extra rations (although these were still minimal) and were less likely to be chosen for deportation lists. Temporary exclusion from transport and additional rations could save lives. Work often also offered a chance to escape the ghetto walls, which gave workers additional chances to smuggle in extra food or rationed material, although this also heightened their risk of being caught and punished."
