        "text": "Booking Conditions\n\n15. Conditions of Suppliers\n\nMany of the services which make up your holiday are provided by independent suppliers. Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier's liability to you, usually in accordance with applicable international conventions or EU regulations (see clause 12(4)(c)). Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from us or the supplier concerned.\n\n16. Special Requests\n\nIf you have any special requests, you must advise us in writing at the time of booking. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met unless we have specifically confirmed this. For your own protection, you should obtain confirmation in writing from us that your request will be complied with (where it is possible for us to give this) if your request is important to you. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the special request on your confirmation letter/invoice or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability. We regret we cannot accept any conditional bookings, i.e. any booking which is specified to be conditional on the fulfilment of a particular request and all such bookings will be treated as \"standard\" bookings subject to the above provisions on special requests.\n\n17. Medical Conditions/Disabilities/Reduced Mobility\n\nRegrettably, many of our tours are not suitable for customers with certain disabilities and they can also be physically demanding. If you have any medical condition or disability which may affect your tour or any health, fitness or mobility concerns which may affect your ability to cope with the tour, please give us full details before you confirm your booking so that we can advise as to the suitability of the chosen arrangements. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate special needs or cause our suppliers to accommodate them, but, if we are to help you choose the right tour for your health, mobility and fitness, we must be aware of all details. Please note that Tour Managers (if on an escorted holiday) cannot provide individual assistance with boarding trains or coaches, or handle your luggage. It is your responsibility to provide us with full and accurate details of your mobility, health and fitness (including any disability), so we can advise you on the suitability of tours. As standard practice all customers are asked at the point of booking whether they have any mobility limitations or health concerns which may impact on their tour. Customers are required to provide all relevant information to ensure that this matter has been carefully considered and we are aware of any issues. We may require you to produce a doctor's certificate certifying that you are fit to participate in the tour. Acting reasonably, if we are unable to properly accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned, we will not confirm your booking or if you did not give us full details at the time of booking, we will cancel it and impose applicable cancellation charges when we become aware of these details. You must also advise us as soon as possible of any change in any disability or medical condition or your health, fitness or mobility or if any medical condition or disability which may affect your tour develops after your booking has been confirmed. Please also see clause 6.\n\n18. Fitness to Travel for Cruise Arrangements\n\nWhere you have booked a cruise, the following conditions will apply in addition to those set out in clause 17.\n\nIn order to ensure that the carrier of your cruise is able to carry passengers safely and in accordance with applicable safety requirements established by international, EU or national law or otherwise in order to meet safety requirements established by competent authorities including the ship's flag state, you (and every member of your group) warrant that you/they are fit to travel by sea and that your/their conduct or condition will not impair the safety of the cruise ship. Please note that the carrier of your cruise may require you to provide medical evidence of fitness to travel, in order to assess whether you can be carried safely and in accordance with applicable international, EU or national law. It is often the case that carriers will be unable to carry passengers who have entered or passed their 24th week of pregnancy by the end of their cruise.\n\nWomen who reach their 23rd week of pregnancy at the end of the cruise may also be required to provide evidence of fitness to travel. Carriers reserve the right to refuse passage if they are not satisfied that the passenger will be safe during the course of the cruise. Pregnant women are therefore strongly recommended to seek medical advice prior to travel, at any stage of their pregnancy. Passengers who require the use of a wheelchair must provide their own standard size wheelchair for the duration of the cruise. Carriers often provide a limited number of wheelchairs which are strictly available for emergency use only. The carrier may require such passengers to be accompanied by a travelling companion who is fit and able to assist them, where it is reasonably deemed by the carrier that this is strictly necessary.\n\n19. Excursions, Activities and Brochure/Website Information\n\nThe information contained in our brochure and on our website is correct to the best of our knowledge at the time of the brochure going to print or at the time of publication on our website. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the brochure and prices at the time of printing or publication, regrettably errors do occasionally occur. You must therefore ensure you check all details of your chosen holiday (including the price) with us at the time of booking.\n\nWe may provide you with information (in our brochure, on our website and/or when you are on holiday) about activities and excursions which are available in the area you are visiting but cannot be pre-booked with us or otherwise purchased via ourselves. We have no involvement in any such activities or excursions which are not run, supervised, controlled, inspected or endorsed in any way by us. They are provided by local operators or other third parties who are entirely independent of us. They do not form any part of your contract with us even where we or your Tour Manager (if on an escorted holiday) suggest particular operators/other third parties and/or assist you in booking such activities or excursions in any way. We cannot accept any liability on any basis in relation to such activities or excursions and the acceptance of liability contained in clause 12(1) of our booking conditions will not apply to them. We do not however exclude liability for the negligence of ourselves or our employees resulting in your death or personal injury.\n\nWe cannot guarantee accuracy at all times of information given in relation to such activities or excursions or about the area(s) you are visiting generally (except where this concerns the services which will form part of your contract) or that any particular excursion or activity which does not form part of our contract will take place as these services are not under our control. If you feel that any of the activities or excursions mentioned in our brochure or on our website which are not part of our contract are vital to the enjoyment of your holiday, write to us immediately and we will tell you the latest known situation.\n\nIf we become aware of any material alterations to destination/area information and/or such outside activities or excursions which can be reasonably expected to affect your decision to book a holiday with us, we will pass on this information at the time of booking.\n\n20. Flights\n\nPlease note the existence of a 'UK Air Safety List' (available for inspection at https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates/) detailing air carriers that are subject to an operating ban within the UK. We will advise you of the carrier(s) or, if the carrier(s) is not known, the likely carrier(s) that will operate your flight(s) at the time of booking. Where we are only able to inform you of the likely carrier(s) at the time of booking, we will inform you of the identity of the actual carrier(s) as soon as we become aware of this. Any change to the operating carrier(s) and/or flight routings (including indirect routings) after your booking has been confirmed will be notified to you as soon as possible. We are not always in a position at the time of booking to confirm flight routings and/or flight timings. Where flight routings and/or flight timings are given at the time of booking or detailed on your confirmation letter/invoice these are for guidance only and are subject to alteration and confirmation. The latest timings will be shown on your itinerary which will be dispatched to you approximately 10 days prior to departure. You must accordingly check your tickets very carefully immediately on receipt to ensure you have the correct flight times. It is possible that flight times may be changed even after tickets have been dispatched.\n\nWe will contact you as soon as possible if this occurs. Any change in the identity of the carrier(s), flight timings, routings (including a change from direct to indirect routings) and/or aircraft type (if given) will not entitle you to cancel or change to other arrangements without paying our normal charges except where specified in these conditions. Regardless of any information given in good faith, operational changes may be made by an airline at any point and we cannot be responsible for these. If the carrier(s) with whom you have a confirmed reservation becomes subject to an operating ban as above as a result of which we/the carrier(s) are unable to offer you a suitable alternative the provisions of clause 9 (Changes and Cancellations by Us) will apply. Prices quoted in this brochure and/or on our website are based on special airfares offered to us by the airlines for group travel. These represent a reduction on the normal IATA fares which entitle passengers to privileges and flexibility that our clients do not normally require as part of the holiday. Should you wish to book your holiday using a flight other than that shown in the brochure/on our website, a flight variation charge from £50 per person will apply in addition to the difference in cost between our special fare and the normal IATA fare for the flight(s) required. Tickets at our special fare are valid only on the airline and dates shown and do not automatically entitle passengers to switch to another carrier in case of a flight cancellation, delay or technical problems with the aircraft or the reservation. Please note that most airlines now operate 100% non- smoking services.\n\n21. Denied Boarding Regulations\n\nIf you or any member of your party misses your flight or other transport arrangement, it is cancelled or you are subject to a delay of over 3 hours for any reason, you must contact us and the airline or other transport supplier concerned immediately. If your flight is cancelled or delayed, your flight ticket is downgraded or boarding is denied by your airline, depending on the circumstances, the airline may be required to pay you compensation, refund the cost of your flight and/or provide you with accommodation and/ or refreshments under the Denied Boarding Regulations 2004. Where applicable, you must pursue the airline for the compensation or other payment due to you. All sums you receive or are entitled to receive from the airline concerned by virtue of these Regulations represent the full amount of your entitlement to compensation or any other payment arising from such cancellation, delay, downgrading or denied boarding. This includes any disappointment, distress, inconvenience or effect on any other arrangements. The fact a delay may entitle you to cancel your flight does not automatically entitle you to cancel any other arrangements even where those arrangements have been made in conjunction with your flight. We have no liability to make any payment to you in relation to the Denied Boarding Regulations as your entitlement to any compensation or other payment (as dealt with above) is covered by the airline's obligations under the Denied Boarding Regulations. If, for any reason, we make any payment to you or a third party which the airline is responsible for in accordance with the Denied Boarding Regulations, you must, when requested, assign to us the rights you have or had to claim the payment in question from the airline. If the airline does not comply with these rules you should complain to the Civil Aviation Authority at www.caa.co.uk/passengers. Please note, your rights under clause 9 (\"Changes and Cancellations by Us\") and clause 12 (\"Our Liability to You\") of these booking conditions are not affected by the above Denied Boarding Regulations except that we are entitled to argue that the amount you receive or are entitled to receive from the airline is sufficient to meet any compensation obligation we may have to you as your tour operator as a result of any such cancellation, delay, downgrading or denied boarding.\n\n22. Rail Journeys and Reservations\n\nWe request rail reservations many months in advance but occasionally there are insufficient First Class seats available. In these situations we will book Standard Class seats and refund the difference to you. Although we do our best to follow the routes noted on the itinerary there might be occasions when a different routing and/or departure time is necessary due to timetable variations or seat availability.\n\nRegardless of any information given by us in good faith, operational changes may be made by a rail supplier/operator at any point and without notice, and we cannot be responsible for these. Increasingly, trains are 100% non-smoking, and reservations are requested in non-smoking accommodation, although at busy times we may be allocated some smoking seats.\n\nWe cannot make specific requests for smoking seats. Prices quoted in this brochure and on our website are based on special fares negotiated with our rail partners for group travel. Should you wish to travel on any Eurostar or other rail service, other than those included as part of your holiday, a rail variation charge of £25 per person per service plus any additional cost will apply. Any change involving sleeper services will be quoted on an individual basis.\n\nTickets for Eurostar train services are issued subject to the conditions set out in Eurostar International Limited's conditions of carriage and/or the conditions of carriage of the carrier in question, copies of which are available from travel agents appointed by Eurostar International Limited or supplied on request.\n\nAll members do their utmost to ensure that all their brochures and other publications print or electronic, clearly and accurately describe the holidays and services offered. Professional service and continual improvements All members are committed to high standards of service and believe in regular and through training of employees. Members continually seek to review and improve their holidays. They listen to their customers and always welcome suggestions for improving standards.\n\nMonitoring Standards\n\nAITO endeavours to monitor quality standards regularly. All customers should receive a post-holiday questionnaire from their tour operators, the results of which are scrutinised by the Association. In addition, customers can leave detailed feedback, accessible from the homepage of AITO's website, or via a direct link supplied by their AITO tour operator, about their holiday.\n\nSustainable tourism\n\nOur members acknowledge the importance of AITO's Sustainable Tourism ethos, which recognises the social, economic and environmental responsibilities of tour operating.\n\nCustomer relations\n\nAll members endeavour to deal swiftly and fairly with any issues their customers may raise. In the unlikely event that a dispute between an AITO member and a customer cannot be settled amicably, AITO's low-cost Independent Dispute Settlement Service may be called upon by either side to bring the matter to a speedy and acceptable conclusion.
