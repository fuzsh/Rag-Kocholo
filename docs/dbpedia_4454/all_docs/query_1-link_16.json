        "text": "The E65 railway line is an important strategic link connecting the Port of Gdansk and the city of Gdynia with Warsaw. The modernisation of the line will involve the rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure, the condition of which has deteriorated over time, and the construction of some realignments for higher speeds.\n\nThe competent authority has decided that a formal EIA is required, in the context of EIA Directive 85/337/EEC as modified by directives 97/11 and 2003/35. Issues of nature conservation are addressed within the framework of the EIA.\n\nThe project will include the provision of acoustic protection and passages for fauna as well as the upgrading of the drainage system, with provision of settlement ponds at certain locations for improving water quality prior to discharging to natural watercourses.\n\nTransposition of EU Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC on procurement has been carried out in Poland in April 2006. Tenders for the works to be carried out in this project are expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, OJEU.\n\nGeneral enquiries and comments\n\nThe EIB is committed to open communication and encourages constructive stakeholder input regarding its activities.\n\nEnquiries and comments concerning the EIBâ€™s involvement in a project or the financing facilities, activities, organisation and objectives of the EIB, can be sent to the EIB Infodesk.\n\nAlternatively, the EIB can be contacted through its external offices.\n\nQueries regarding details of a specific project, in particular when it is under appraisal by the EIB, should preferably be addressed directly to project promoters.\n\nMedia enquiries\n\nMedia-related enquiries can be addressed to the EIB Press Office. Please also visit our Media information section.\n\nComplaints mechanism\n\nAny complaint regarding alleged maladministration can be lodged via the EIB Complaints Mechanism.
