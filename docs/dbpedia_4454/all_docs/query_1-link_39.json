        "text": "Results and discussion\n\nThe levels of PAHs were determined in soil samples and selected plants. The PAH contents in the soil collected from the four functional parts of the junction, i.e. “siding”, “loading”, “platform” and “cleaning”, are presented in Table . The results obtained from each study area are represented by two values, i.e. A (between rails—rail gauge) and B (shoulder outside rails). Control values represented results obtained from the three described reference areas, respectively.\n\nWhilst analyzing the total PAHs found in soil in different parts of the railway junction Iława Główna, the highest concentrations of these substances were detected in the platform and railway siding areas reaching in siding 59,508 and 58,985 μg kg−1 (A and B, respectively) and in platform 49,670 and 41,026 μg kg−1 (A and B, respectively). The concentration of PAHs in the loading ramp was placed at the level 17,948 and 41,026 μg kg−1 (A and B, respectively). Amongst the investigated functional parts of the junction, the lowest contamination was detected in the cleaning bay area, reaching 15,376 and 7,986 μg kg−1 (A and B, respectively). Figure presented the comparison of total PAHs content in rail gauge (A) and shoulder (B). In all the investigated areas, the total PAHs content is slightly higher in transect A than in transect B. All amounts are significantly higher than the amount of PAHs in control areas.\n\nThe PAHs concentration in soil of the three reference areas varied from 391 to 932 μg kg−1. In all the investigated areas, the level of PAHs in the rail gauge was slightly higher than in the shoulder. Such a pattern of PAH levels indicates that soil contamination is mostly created either by very intensive train movement (platform) or by rolling stock remaining in one place for a long time (siding). In the loading ramp and the cleaning bay where traffic is not heavy and rolling stock remains for a relatively short time, the PAH level is less increased compared with the formerly described parts of the junction. The same distribution of contamination was observed in the past (Malawska and Wiłkomirski 2001), but currently the contamination level is much higher.\n\nFigure presented the percentage content of three-, four-, five- and six-ring PAHs in railway junction Iława Główna. It proved that the most abundant groups of hydrocarbons in soil of all the parts of the junction were four- and five-ring PAHs.\n\nThe tracks of all the investigated parts of the junction were covered by plants, although in different degree. The plant cover on track which is very heavily used within platform area was very poor. A slightly bigger plant cover was observed in the loading ramp, whereas in the railway siding and the cleaning bay, the plant cover was relatively more abundant but still rather scanty.\n\nIn all the investigated areas, 120 plant species were found (Galera et al., submitted for publication). However, the prevailing number of them was represented by one or a few specimens. Four species occurring in relatively higher abundance were selected for PAHs analysis, although in the loading ramp and platform areas only one species could be collected in the amount which makes chemical analysis possible. The selected species included three perennials (Daucus carota, Pastinaca sativa and Taraxacum officinale) and one annual plant (Sonchus oleraceus). All the collected plant specimens were divided into aerial parts and roots.\n\nThe comparison of PAH total content in different plants in railway junction Iława Główna is presented in Fig. . The highest level of PAHs (22,492 μg kg−1) was observed in T. officinale growing in the cleaning bay. The highest PAH accumulation in roots was observed in plants growing in railway siding area and reached 15,182, 15,461 and 14,896 μg kg−1 in D. carota, S. oleraceus and P. sativa, respectively. Table shows the PAH content in the aerial parts and roots of a selected plant in the investigated areas of the junction.\n\nThe percentage content of PAHs possessing different numbers of rings in the molecule in aerial parts and roots of selected species growing in different parts of Iława Główna junction was presented in Fig. . The most abundant group of PAHs present in plants in the investigated areas is represented by four-ring PAHs. Plants of three species growing in the railway siding differ from other investigated plants by a much smaller amount of five- and six-ring PAHs in aerial parts.\n\nThe present study was carried out in September 2008. Thirteen years ago in the same study area, the following 14 PAHs were determined: acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(123-cd)pyrene, dibenzoanthracene and bezo(ghi)perylene (Malawska and Wiłkomirski 2001). The comparison of earlier findings with the results indicating the total level of the same 14 PAHs determined in the present study showed a very significant increase of PAHs content in all the functional parts of the railway junction Iława Główna. At the same time, the PAH level in the control areas did not change. The comparison of the total level of 14 investigated PAHs in the soil of the different parts of the junction (in 1995 and 2008) is presented in Fig. .\n\nAccording to the data obtained from Polish Rail Regional Head Office in Olsztyn, the different parts of the railway junction Iława Główna were renovated (including the replacement of ballast bed and railway ties): cleaning bay in 1978, track no. 7 in 1977, loading ramp in 1984 and railway siding in 1991. Between our former investigations and the present study, no other renovation was carried out. Hence, the 13 years of intensive railway use led to the substantial increase of the PAHs level in soil.\n\nSimilar analysis also indicated a remarkably high contamination of plants with PAHs compared with previous investigations. The control made for T. officinale did not show the increase of the contamination. These results are presented in Fig. . Very interesting results are presented in Fig. showing the proportion between PAHs possessing different number of rings in the molecule.\n\nThe significant percentage of five- and six-ring PAHs in the soil (ranging from about 25% to about 50%) is very characteristic. This percentage is different in the case of plants. The lack of five- and six-ring PAHs in plants growing in control areas and the small percentage of these compounds in plants growing within railway junction suggested that railway transport is a source of serious pollution with PAHs. It seems that the content of “heavy” PAHs in the soil is associated with the permanent and long cumulative deposit, whereas plants reflect rather current deposit connected with railway emission. This is in accordance with the observations concerning the different uptake pathways of contaminants into plants (Trapp 1995; Barber et al. 2004). The smaller percentage of the “light” PAHs could also be connected with their evaporation from the soil. Such tendencies were observed both in 1995 and 2008.\n\nThe levels of the investigated heavy metals were determined in soil samples and selected plants. The heavy metal contents in soil are presented in Table .\n\nThe levels of nine heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Hg, Fe, Co, Cr, Mo) were established. The highest level of lead, which exceeded the control level approximately 50-fold, was determined in the siding area. In other parts of the junction, the lead level was lower and exceeded the control value by ca. tenfold, 22-fold and 20-fold, respectively. The cadmium level is rather low in all the investigated areas. However, in the area of siding and in railway gauge of the loading ramp, the level of cadmium is higher than in other parts of the junction. The highest concentration of copper was detected in the platform area, what is easy to understand due to the intensive action of pantographs on trolley wires (track 7 is intensively used by passenger trains and some of them do not stop at the station, passing through with a high velocity).\n\nThe whole area of the junction contains elevated concentration of zinc. The highest concentration of this metal was observed on the siding, exceeding the control level approximately 60-fold. A significant increase in mercury content was observed in the cleaning bay area and in the railway siding. In both areas, the average mercury concentration exceeded the control level about 30 times.\n\nCobalt and molybdenum concentrations in the soil of all the investigated areas were relatively low. Iron contamination of soil is high in all the functional parts of the junction, especially in the platform area where in the railway gauge its level reached ca. 11%, justifying the common name of the railway. Chromium contamination varied reaching the highest level in the rail gauge in the platform area. Generally, the contamination of soil with all the heavy metals, except mercury, was higher in the railway siding and platform area and lower in the loading ramp and cleaning bay.\n\nWith regard to the railway studies, Liu et al. (2009) reported the levels of heavy metals alongside mountain railway in China. These concentrations were comparable to our results. The heavy metal contents in roots and aerial parts of selected plants collected in different functional parts of the junction are presented in Table .\n\nIn nearly all the investigated plants, the contents of heavy metals were higher in roots than in aerial parts. A different tendency was demonstrated only in the case of molybdenum.\n\nThe concentration of PAHs in the area of railway junction significantly increased from 1995 to 2008. The heavy metal concentration did not change considerably during this period. We assumed that this was connected with the railway ballast permeability making the leaching of soluble contamination possible. The comparisons of heavy metal contents in 1995 and 2008 in soil and plants are presented in Tables and , respectively.\n\nThe statistical analysis showing the dependence between contents of contaminants in plants and soil is presented in Table . The obtained results show:\n\nHigh positive dependence between Cu, Fe and Hg (lower) contents in soil and the amount of these metals in aerial parts of plants\n\nHigh positive dependence between Pb, Cu, Fe and Hg (lower) contents in soil and the amount of these metals in roots of plants\n\nHigh positive dependence between Cu, Hg and Fe contents in aerial parts and roots\n\nThe described values indicate that these elements are absorbed by the root system from the soil and transported to leaves. The high dependence between Pb content in soil and roots and lack of such dependence between Pb content in soil and aerial parts indicate that lead is absorbed from the soil and deposited in roots. The dependences between Cd content in soil and roots as well as in soil and aerial parts are not observed, although the relationship between the content of this element in roots and aerial parts is highly positive which suggest mobility of cadmium. The content of each heavy metal in the soil of all the investigated parts of the railway junction exceeded the average amount of these elements in Poland’s soils (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias 1999).\n\nNo relationship between the total content of PAHs in soil and plants was found, which indicates that these compounds are deposited from the atmosphere and are not absorbed by the root system. In Poland, the assessment of soil quality is carried out based on different classifications, i.e. National Research Institute (Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, ISSPC) system (sum of 13 PAHs), Ministry Regulation (sum of nine PAHs) and Dutch List (sum of ten PAHs). Table shows the comparison of PAHs content and soil assessment.\n\nThe Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation in Pulawy proposed the classification of agricultural soil contaminated with PAHs, which is often used in Poland. According to this classification, PAH content in agricultural soil below 200 μg kg−1 can be considered as “background level”, whereas the range from 200 to 600 μg kg−1 is characteristic of unpolluted soil with slightly increased PAH content. The sum of PAHs (600–10,000 μg kg−1) corresponds to the contaminated soil with different levels of contamination, and the content of these compounds exceeding 10,000 μg kg−1 corresponds to very heavily contaminated soils where reclamation is needed.\n\nThe soil from all the investigated parts of the railway junction Iława Główna is heavily polluted type (class 5°). The only exception is surface B (outside the rails) in the cleaning bay, where the level of PAH contamination places the soil in class 4°.\n\nAccording to the Ministry Regulation, all the parts of the investigated railway junction are covered by the polluted soil. According to the Dutch List, the soil from the area of the railway siding and platform are too heavily polluted (class 3°) and the soil from the area of loading ramp and cleaning bay is polluted (class 2°)"
