        "text": "Corridor description\n\nThe total length of the North Sea - Baltic corridor (NSB) is 9 030 km long, including the Connecting Europe Facility 2 (CEF 2) extension. It crosses 9 countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nThe NSB CNC connects the ports of the Eastern shore of the Baltic Sea with the ports of the North Sea. The CEF 2 extension adds the northern Swedish port of Lulea to the corridor. From there, it passes south through the modern harbours on the Gulf of Finland of Helsinki (Vuosaari) and Tallinn (Muuga). Then continuing south through the three Baltic States and north-eastern Poland until Warsaw. CEF 2 adds a connection to the southern industrial region of Poland, passing through Krakow, Katowice and Wroclaw. From Warsaw, it follows the traditional East-West corridor to Lodz, Poznan and Berlin continuing to the ports on the North Sea coast. The corridor has branches to Ventspils in Latvia, and Klaipeda and Vilnius in Lithuania. It should be noted that sections in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia with a track gauge that is different from the European standard nominal track gauge (i.e., sections outside the Rail Baltic) are exempt from the obligation to deploy ERTMS under TEN-T Regulation.\n\nA key rail project is \"Rail Baltica\", a European standard gauge railway connecting the Baltic states to the European railway network. The project involves the construction of a new railway line spanning over 870 km from Tallinn to Warsaw, passing through Riga and Vilnius.\n\nERTMS deployment on the corridor\n\nThe following image shows the state of play and deadlines for the ERTMS deployment in the NSB corridor, considering the dates of the EDP:\n\nOverall, ETCS is in operation on 12% of NSB, while GSM-R is in operation on 58% of the corridor. According to the EDP, 1 776 km are expected to be operational by 2023. In March 2023, 33% of the NSB length planned in the EDP by 2023 was in operation with ETCS. According to the TEN-T Guidelines, 7 870 km are expected to be equipped by 2030.\n\nThe deployment status per Member State where the NSB corridor runs is as follows:"
