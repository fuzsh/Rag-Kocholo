        "text": "Post by ameis33 on\n\nA recent thread about railroad cancels remind me something i wrote almost 10 years ago about railways and train stations postmarks used in the Kingdom of Poland... Maybe it could be of any interest...\n\nPolish railways and train stations postmarks\n\nfrom \"Polskie Znaki Pocztowe Tom I\", reprint of 1960 of the omonimous book written in the 30's...\n\n... To cancel postal stamps on letters sent from Warsaw train station post offices, special marks, made by four concentric circles with two letters inside, were used. Up to 1866, in Warsaw there were two train stations: the \"Warszawa\" and the \"Praga\" stations. From the first (\"Warszawa\"), it departed two railway lines, the first going to Vienna and the second going to Berlin through Bydgoszcz (the german Bromberg). From the \"Praga\" station instead, it departed a single railway line going to St. Petersbourg.\n\nStamps on letter sent from the post office in the \"Warszawa\" station were cancelled by mean of a mark with the \"BW\" letters inside (tabl. 19, fig. 1). Near of this cancel, it was also applied the datary \"EKSPEDICJA POCZT DWORZEC WARSZAWA\". On the other side, stamps on letter sent from the post office in the \"Praga\" station were cancelled by mean of a mark with the \"DP\" letters inside (tabl. 19, fig. 3), near of which there was a datary, similar to the previous one, but with the inscription \"DWORZEC PRAGA\" (tabl. 19, fig. 4). These cancels and post marks are usually in black color, but the BW mark and the two datary can also be found in red color.\n\nIn the year 1851, on the line opened at that time between Warsaw and Vienna, 4 ambulant post offices were introduced. These ambulant post offices were granted to cancel the postage stamps with some special stamps made by 6 concentric circles with a great point in the center, whose dimensions were: for the wagons 1 and 2, 3 mms; for the third one: 2 mms; for the fourth: 3 and 1/2 mms of diameter. Close to these cancellations some special stamps were applied with the words \"EKSPEDICJA POCZT W WAGONIE\" and the number of the wagon in the middle.\n\nIn the year 1861, on the route from Warsaw to Bydgoszcz, four new ambulant post offices were then opened. Those offices used to cancel postage stamps special cancels made by 4 concentric circles with the letters DB inside. Wagon 5 had a stamp with thin letters and a dot after every letter. The wagons 6 and 7 with the letters little bit wider and with the point after just the B. Wagon 8 with very wide letters and without points (tabl. 20, fig. 2). Nearby the cancels, there were applied other post marks with the number of the ambulant in the middle, similar to those described above, but with the numbers 5-8 in the center. Besides this, on stampless letters it can be found the \"EXPEDYCYA POCZT W WAGONIE\" post mark with the date in the middle (tabl. 19, fig. 11). The meaning of this post mark still has not been explained.\n\nAll the above cancels and post marks can only be found in black color, with the exception of the cancel with the 3 mm diameter point and the ones with the letter D.B. of the first and second type and for the 5th and 6th ambulant, that we have seen also in red color.\n\nBesides the cancels and the post marks shown before, there are also other cancels always done by four concetric circles with letters inside. These cancels were used in special postal offices realized adapting wagons destined to the passengers transport on trains in which there weren't ambulant post offices and they were probably served by special postal inspectors. Here are the cancels:\n\n1) on the route Warsaw-Bydgoszcz: with the letters DB1 / DB2 (tabl. 20, fig. 3 and 4)\n\n2) on the route Warsaw-Vienna: with the letters \"D.W.\" in two different shapes, with small and greater letters (tabl. 20, fig. 6)\n\n3) on the route, opened in 1866, to Terespol, from Warsaw to Siedlce, and subsequently to Brzesc (I think Brest?), with the letters \"D.T.\", in two different shapes, with small and greater letters (tabl. 20, fig. 5)\n\nThese six cancels were probably introduced just after the 1860 polish postage stamps withdrawal, since they can just be found on russian stamps. On all the letters cancelled in this way, an hand written note shows the station from here the letters were sent. Such cancels can be found just in black color.\n\nThe cancel with the letters \"B.W.\" used in the Warszawa station can still be found in 1874, but from the beginnings of 1874 the letters \"B.W.\" in the center were erased on order of the Russian postal authority.\n\nOn russian ambulant post offices travelling on railways from St. Petersbourg to Wierzbolowa and from St. Petersbourg to Warsaw, which partially walked through the territory of the Kingdom of Poland, were used to cancel stamps or to sign mail these russian marks: the triangular dotted cancels with the figures 12, 14, 15, 16 in the middle or the datestamp with the words \"С. П. Б. Варшавск. Ж. Д.\" and the wagon's number. The same marks can also be found on the 1860 polish postage stamps.\n\nPost by ameis33 on\n\nMikstein Vs. Polański\n\nThe basic information about this matter come from two polish authors: Mikstein and Polański. Before WWII, Mikstein has been a prolific author. He wrote a volume about postal seals in polish territories in XVIII century (Mikstein, \"Pieczęcie pocztowe na ziemniach polski w XVIII wieku 1762-1800\"). Take note he has used the word seals, not marks or cancels, as letters were closed using wax seals.\n\nHe also wrote a second volume (perhaps a sequel of the first?) about postal marks in the Warsaw principate and in the Kingdom of Poland (Mikstein-Rachmanow \"Stemple pocztowe księstwa Warszawskiego i Królestwo Polskie 1808-1870\", Nakładem czasopisma \"Ikaros\", Białystok 1938). This volume describe all postal marks used in the prephilatelic period in Poland, but also cancels on Poland nr. 1 and the railways postmarks i'm speaking about. I don't have information about translation in english or other languages of this book, but it has been completely integrated in the book \"Polskie Znaki Pocztowe\", ed. 1960, from where i've taken the source of my translation. More than integrated, it has been completely copied. Well, i didn't compare word by word, but i can assure it at least for some chapters.\n\nBut Mikstein it has not been the only author who wrote on the same matter. Another important source of information is certainly the book of Włodimierz Polański \"Znaki i marki pocztowe w Polsce w XVIII i XIX wieku (1780-1870)\", postal signs and marks in Poland in XVIII and XIX century, published in Poland in 1922.\n\nBoth books treats almost the same arguments, but the work of Polański it is based on the study of documents, regulaments, decrets of the postal administration, with many references to these documents, and even some picture of the original in the appendixes. I believe the work of Mikstein has the same bases, but the results are sometime expressed \"as is\", without the description of the source, i don't know. I prefer much more the exposition of Polański, i find it better arranged, more sistematic and even more reliable.\n\nThe original book of Polanski has been written in 55 numbered copies. It has been translated in german in 1938 (? almost). The original book has been reprinted in 1985, and the german edition in 1993.\n\nBTW, the National Bibliotec of Warsaw has the original editions of both the three books i've spoken about."
