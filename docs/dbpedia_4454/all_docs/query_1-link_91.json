The EIB Vice-President, Vazil Hudak, and the Mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, signed a PLN 1.5 billion (EUR 350m) loan agreement today during a ceremony at the City hall, which will serve primarily for the extension of the second line of the city metro.\n\nThe City will use the EIB loan to co-finance a 16,4 km-long extension of second metro line (Metro line II) in Warsaw.\n\nThe overall financing is the third big EIB loan to Warsaw for the creation of a modern metro network. The EU bank has already financed in 2012 and 2013 the construction of the central section of the second metro line, as well as the purchase of rolling stock for both metro lines."
