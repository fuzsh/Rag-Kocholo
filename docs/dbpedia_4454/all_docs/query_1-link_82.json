        "text": "On 14 and 15 June 2023 we expect prominent speakers and experts in level crossing safety, trespass and suicide prevention from 15 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, France, England, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Canada, USA and Argentina and more).\n\nWe will be sharing best practices on Risk assessment, Engineering, Engagement, Education and Community Outreach with some 150 delegates from 26 countries from 4 continents.\n\n2ND EDITION OF TRESPAD on 14 June 2023\n\nTrespass and Suicide events affect the whole of the rail industry with an adverse impact on safety, performance, reputation, costs and efficiency. It affects all parts of the business and the society as a whole and is therefore something that we must tackle together.\n\nThe International Trespass Awareness Day (TRESPAD) is also a UIC initiative to prevent railway trespassing.\n\nThe Trespass and Suicide Prevention Conference to launch this second “TRESPAD” campaign aims to share with industry partners the key activities that existing programmes are undertaking. Through this conference we will aim to identify what exists, what else is needed, what individual organisations can do to help prevent trespass and suicides and how we can work much closer together on these issues.\n\nPublic targeted during TRESPAD 2023 campaign: “Young people”\n\nSlogan 2023 : “Tracks are for Trains !”\n\nThe second edition is foreseen on 14 June 2023 and its launch conference will take place at the National Institute of Polish Rural Culture and Heritage = Narodowy Instytut Kultury i Dziedzictwa Wsi on Krakowskie Przedmieście Street nearby the Castle of Warsaw (website only in Polish) nearby Warsaw Castle.\n\nAt this occasion UIC produced some posters and a video available in English, Spanish and French. The video was shared on a free and voluntary basis by Network Rail and will be used by the countries participating in the TRESPAD campaign on 14 June.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z_3WBUJNAZQ\n\nHarrison’s Story tells the story of 11-year-old Harrison Ballantyne, who tragically lost his life when he was electrocuted by overhead power cables after straying into a rail freight depot to retrieve a lost football. The railway has many hidden dangers. Harrison was only playing football with his friends. He didn’t expect the electricity to jump. Important: Know the risks, make the right decisions and stay away from railway lines.

Since 2009 the campaign has been spearheaded by the International Union of Railways (UIC), the worldwide railway organisation with the support of the railway community around the world. About 50 countries usually take part in the ILCAD annual campaign.\n\nPublic targeted during ILCAD 2023 campaign: “Agricultural and industrial crossing users”\n\nSlogan 2023 :”Tracks are for Trains !”\n\nThis year, PKP and PKP Group Foundation kindly host the launch events where we may share good practices and projects to improve safety and reduce the accident toll.\n\nThis conference attracts railway industry representatives, road authorities, academics, and many others from around the world who are working to raise awareness about the dangers surrounding level crossings. 2023 International Conference to launch the 15th edition of the International Level Crossing Awareness Day (ILCAD) campaign will be held at the Royal Castle of Warsaw\n\nOur video, bringing together some CCTV footage, shows the misuse of some level crossings in various countries.\n\nILCAD 2023 targets this year “Drivers of agricultural and industrial vehicles” using level crossings”.\n\nThe aim is to make them more aware of the risks they may encounter, in particular when crossing with long and heavy vehicles, and finally of the risks they may generate to railway passengers and personnel in the event of a collision. It is available in English, Polish, French, German and Spanish and will be used by our partners participating in ILCAD: https://youtu.be/OK1LS0jJhYQ\n\nMore information on the previous ILCAD 2022 conference\n\nTo access the ILCAD Conference 2022 recorded at the Cable Center on June, 9 during ILCAD conference visit\n\nOr visit the ILCAD 2022 youtube playlist"
