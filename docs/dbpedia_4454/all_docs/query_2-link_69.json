        "text": "There Is No Teacher But The Enemy!\n\nAll security practitioners should attend FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence to sharpen their analytical skills. This course is unlike any other technical training you have ever experienced. It focuses on structured analysis in order to establish a solid foundation for any security skillset and to amplify existing skills. The course will help practitioners from across the security spectrum:\n\nDevelop analysis skills to better comprehend, synthesize, and leverage complex scenarios\n\nIdentify and create intelligence requirements through practices such as threat modeling\n\nUnderstand and develop skills in tactical, operational, and strategic-level threat intelligence\n\nGenerate threat intelligence to detect, respond to, and defeat focused and targeted threats\n\nLearn the different sources to collect adversary data and how to exploit and pivot off of those data\n\nValidate information received externally to minimize the costs of bad intelligence\n\nCreate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in formats such as YARA and STIX/TAXII\n\nUnderstand and exploit adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures, and leverage frameworks such as the Kill Chain, Diamond Model, and MITRE ATT&CK\n\nEstablish structured analytical techniques to be successful in any security role\n\nIt is common for security practitioners to call themselves analysts. But how many of us have taken structured analysis training instead of simply attending technical training? Both are important, but very rarely do analysts focus on training on analytical ways of thinking. This course exposes analysts to new mindsets, methodologies, and techniques to complement their existing knowledge and help them establish new best practices for their security teams. Proper analysis skills are key to the complex world that defenders are exposed to on a daily basis.\n\nThe analysis of an adversary's intent, opportunity, and capability to do harm is known as cyber threat intelligence. Intelligence is not a data feed, nor is it something that comes from a tool. Intelligence is actionable information that addresses an organization's key knowledge gaps, pain points, or requirements. This collection, classification, and exploitation of knowledge about adversaries gives defenders an upper hand against adversaries and forces defenders to learn and evolve with each subsequent intrusion they face.\n\nCyber threat intelligence thus represents a force multiplier for organizations looking to establish or update their response and detection programs to deal with increasingly sophisticated threats. Malware is an adversary's tool, but the real threat is the human one, and cyber threat intelligence focuses on countering those flexible and persistent human threats with empowered and trained human defenders.\n\nKnowledge about the adversary is core to all security teams. The red team needs to understand adversaries' methods in order to emulate their tradecraft. The Security Operations Center needs to know how to prioritize intrusions and quickly deal with those that need immediate attention. The incident response team needs actionable information on how to quickly scope and respond to targeted intrusions. The vulnerability management group needs to understand which vulnerabilities matter most for prioritization and the risk that each one presents. The threat hunting team needs to understand adversary behaviors to search out new threats.\n\nIn other words, cyber threat intelligence informs all security practices that deal with adversaries. FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence will equip you, your security team, and your organization with the level of tactical, operational, and strategic cyber threat intelligence skills and tradecraft required to better understand the evolving threat landscape and accurately and effectively counter those threats.\n\nBusiness Takeaways:\n\nUnderstand the everchanging cyber threat landscape and what it means for your organization\n\nPractice analytic techniques to inform key business leaders on how to most effectively defend themselves and the organization against targeted threats\n\nIdentify cost-effective ways of leveraging open-source and community threat intelligence tools, along with familiarity with some of the most impactful commercial tools available.\n\nEffectively communicate threat intelligence at tactical, operational, and strategic levels\n\nBecome a force multiplier for other core business functions, including security operations, incident response, and business operations.\n\nLaptop Requirements\n\nImportant! Bring your own system configured according to these instructions.\n\nA properly configured system is required to fully participate in this course. If you do not carefully read and follow these instructions, you will not be able to fully participate in hands-on exercises in your course. Therefore, please arrive with a system meeting all of the specified requirements.\n\nBack up your systemÂ before class. Better yet, use a system without any sensitive/critical data. SANS is not responsible for your system or data.\n\nMANDATORY FOR578 SYSTEM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nCPU: 64-bit Intel i5/i7 (8th generation or newer), or AMD equivalent. A x64 bit, 2.0+ GHz or newer processor is mandatory for this class.\n\nCRITICAL: Apple Silicon devices cannot perform the necessary virtualization and therefore cannot in any way be used for this course.\n\nBIOS settings must be set to enable virtualization technology, such as \"Intel-VTx\" or \"AMD-V\" extensions.Â Be absolutely certain you can access your BIOS if it is password protected, in case changes are necessary.\n\n16GB of RAM or more is required.\n\n100GB of free storage space or more is required.\n\nAt least one available USB 3.0 Type-A port. A Type-C to Type-A adapter may be necessary for newer laptops. Some endpoint protection software prevents the use of USB devices, so test your system with a USB drive before class.\n\nWireless networking (802.11 standard) is required. There is no wired Internet access in the classroom.\n\nMANDATORY FOR578 HOST CONFIGURATION AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nYour host operating system must be the latest version of Windows 10, Windows 11, or macOS 10.15.x or newer.\n\nFully update your host operating system prior to the class to ensure you have the right drivers and patches installed.\n\nLinux hosts are not supported in the classroom due to their numerous variations. If you choose to use Linux as your host, you are solely responsible for configuring it to work with the course materials and/or VMs.\n\nLocal Administrator Access is required. (Yes, this is absolutely required. Don't let your IT team tell you otherwise.) If your company will not permit this access for the duration of the course, then you should make arrangements to bring a different laptop.\n\nYou should ensure that antivirus or endpoint protection software is disabled, fully removed, or that you have the administrative privileges to do so. Many of our courses require full administrative access to the operating system and these products can prevent you from accomplishing the labs.\n\nAny filtering of egress traffic may prevent accomplishing the labs in your course. Firewalls should be disabled or you must have the administrative privileges to disable it.\n\nMicrosoft OfficeÂ (any version) installed on your host. Note that you can downloadÂ Office Trial Software onlineÂ (free for 30 days).\n\nDownload and install VMware Workstation Pro 16.2.X+ or VMware Player 16.2.X+ (for Windows 10 hosts), VMware Workstation Pro 17.0.0+ or VMware Player 17.0.0+ (for Windows 11 hosts), or VMWare Fusion Pro 12.2+ or VMware Fusion Player 11.5+ (for macOS hosts) prior to class beginning.Â If you do not own a licensed copy of VMware Workstation Pro or VMware Fusion Pro, you can download a free 30-day trial copy from VMware. VMware will send you a time-limited serial number if you register for the trial at their website. Also note that VMware Workstation Player offers fewer features than VMware Workstation Pro. For those with Windows host systems, Workstation Pro is recommended for a more seamless student experience.\n\nOn Windows hosts, VMware products might not coexist with the Hyper-V hypervisor. For the best experience, ensure VMware can boot a virtual machine. This may require disabling Hyper-V. Instructions for disabling Hyper-V, Device Guard, and Credential Guard are contained in the setup documentation that accompanies your course materials.\n\nDownload and installÂ 7-ZipÂ (for Windows Hosts) orÂ KekaÂ (for macOS hosts). These tools are also included in your downloaded course materials.\n\nYour course media is delivered via download. The media files for class can be large. Many are in the 40-50GB range, with some over 100GB. You need to allow plenty of time for the download to complete. Internet connections and speed vary greatly and are dependent on many different factors. Therefore, it is not possible to give an estimate of the length of time it will take to download your materials. Please start your course media downloadsÂ as soon as you get the link. You will need your course media immediately on the first day of class. Do not wait until the night before class to start downloading these files.\n\nYour course materials include a \"Setup Instructions\" document that details important steps you must take before you travel to a live class event or start an online class. It may take 30 minutes or more to complete these instructions.\n\nYour class uses an electronic workbook for its lab instructions. In this new environment, a second monitor and/or a tablet device can be useful for keeping class materials visible while you are working on your course's labs.\n\nIf you have additional questions about the laptop specifications, please contactÂ support."
