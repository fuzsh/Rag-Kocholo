Due to its geopolitical location, the country connects the East with the West of Europe in the cultural, political and economic dimensions. Due to numerous military conflicts worldwide in recent years, Poland is continuously confronted with complex problems arising from its residentsâ migratory background. Warsaw, the capital of Poland, located at the heartland of the unique Mazovia Province with a population estimated at nearly 2 million residents, is one of the most dynamic metropolises in Europe. Once known as the Paris of the East, Warsaw is a city of astonishing contrasts, with its historical roots deeply embedded in multiculturalism and multilingualism. Split by the Vistula River, Warsaw has two sides with different atmospheres and attractions. Warsawâs downtown, located on the north side of the Vistula River running through the city, is the centre of business, art, entertainment, shopping areas, fine restaurants, museums, theatres, cinemas, galleries, skyscrapers, bars and hotels. Being a research and development centre, Warsawâs downtown is a perfect location for international scientific and economic events, conferences, and conventions. The glamorous northside riverbank is bustling with energy and activity. In contrast, the Bohemian Praga districts on the south bank offer numerous attractions off the beaten track, alluring tourists to taste their unique atmosphere, admire their innovative street art, and visit alternative theatres. Warsaw is the largest and the most renowned university city in Poland. The University of Warsaw is an institution with 200 years of tradition, 30 academic and research units, 21 faculties, and 1600 research projects financed by national and international research programmes. The historical Main Campus of the University of Warsaw, founded in 1816, is located north of the Vistula River in close proximity to the city centre, around 40-50 minutes from the major international airport and 10-15 minutes from the international railway station. A regular bus line runs daily between the airport and the venue. It is well connected to the downtown (bus, subway) with an average commute time of ten to fifteen minutes. Most hotels considered for this conference are situated either in the vicinity of the venue or downtown. The enchanting Krakowskie PrzedmieÅcie Royal Avenue, surrounded by prestigious manor houses, palaces and notable institutions, runs north of the campus and links it with the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Presidential Palace and the Warsaw Old Town. Being a noble mixture of historical charm and modernity, Royal Avenue is an attractive nightlife scene for tourists, residents and students.\n\nUniversity of Warsaw\n\nFounded in 1816, the University of Warsaw (UW) is the largest (over 45,000 students) and, according to the latest Shanghai Ranking, the best higher education establishment in Poland is positioned among the top 3% of the worldâs best universities â it boasts a well-established tradition of active international research: it implemented over 220 European research projects, including 14 prestigious ERC grants, won 98 projects in FP7, including 6 ERC Starting Grants and 1 ERC Advanced Grant (in addition to two other ERC AdG where the UW is an institutional Co-Beneficiary), one REGPOT Project for over 4.5 million euro and three CIP Projects.
