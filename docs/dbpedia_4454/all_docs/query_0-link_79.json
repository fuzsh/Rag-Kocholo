        "text": "The first of the 20 modern PKP Intercity trains is now in Poland. On 12 August, at high noon, the blue and silver rolling stock arrived at Wrocław Main Rail Station. The train had set off on Friday from the Italian Alstom factory, with PKP Cargo responsible for transportation.\n\nThe first of the 20 modern PKP Intercity trains is now in Poland. On 12 August, at high noon, the blue and silver rolling stock arrived at Wrocław Main Rail Station. The train had set off on Friday from the Italian Alstom factory, with PKP Cargo responsible for transportation. This first arrival will now undergo numerous tests, at locations including the test track of the Railway Institute in Żmigród.\n\n“From the Italian land to Poland...”\n\nThe train set off from Savigliano in Italy on Friday 9 August, beginning a journey of around 1,500 km. With the rolling stock not yet in possession of safety certification, it represented a special dispatch and was conducted by a PKP Cargo EU45 locomotive. For the period of the journey through Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic the freight carrier provided a staff of four drivers – one per stage of the route, for each country. The EIC Premium rolling stock arrived in Poland from the direction of the Czech Republic, via the Lichkov-Międzylesie crossing.\n\n“EIC Premium is a new standard for Polish railways,” says Jakub Karnowski, President of the Board at PKP SA. “It represents more than just a change in the level of comfort experienced by PKP Intercity passengers while travelling. It is also the wide range of works being performed by the other companies of our Group in implementing the project. The modernization of the railway lines of the infrastructure administrator, PKP PLK, and the investments undertaken by PKP Energetyka, mean that this train sets a new, higher level for the whole of the railways,” he adds.\n\nfot. Bartłomiej Banaszak\n\nSafety certification\n\n“The train which has arrived in Poland will undergo all necessary tests in order to be able to carry our passengers safely; diagnostic equipment is to be found on board,” says Janusz Malinowski, President of the Board at PKP Intercity. “Testing will begin at the test track in Żmigród and will be continued on individual routes along which the train will run from December 2014,” he explains.\n\nEIC Premium will be capable of a speed above that currently permitted on the Polish market of 160 km/h. First, however, it must undergo an approval process. While still at the Alstom factory in Savigliano in Italy the first static tests took place. A further stage, the so-called dynamic tests – the study of the train in motion – will now be conducted in Poland. A majority will take place at the test track of the Railway Scientific and Research Institute, which is located close by Żmigród, c. 40 km from Wrocław. This site allows tests to be conducted for stability, reliability and endurance and the dynamics of devices and systems utilized on the railways. It has available a loop of track with a length of 7.725 km.\n\n“All tests will be conducted by specialists from the Railway Institute,” says Dr Andrzej Żurkowski, engineer and Director of the Institute. “At the test track the rolling stock will first undergo dynamic testing, with tests of braking, safety devices and the effect on traffic control devices, as well as pantograph testing, among other research. The Railway Institute is a leading unit in the variety of technical issues in track transport,” he continues. “Recently tested items include a majority of the rail rolling stock introduced by carriers for use in Poland, traffic and communication control systems (ERTMS) and many other subsystems,” Dr Żurkowski adds.\n\n“We are proud of the fact that a first train of Alstom production is coming to Poland, and will undergo tests at the Railway Institute according to schedule,” says Lesław Kuzaj, President of Alstom in Poland. “I am convinced that passengers will fully appreciate the modernity and safety of trains of the new generation which will soon appear on Polish routes,” he states.\n\nThe first stage of testing will conclude at the end of September or beginning of October. The train will then be dispatched to the Central Main Line, among other locations. Near Olsztyn the Pendolino will be tested on curves, while close to Nowy Sącz its potential for travel uphill will be assessed. The tests on railway lines are due to last until the middle of December. Once these are concluded the first train, as a version containing measuring equipment, will return to Italy. The analysis of the documentation gathered will then begin. The train should receive the approval of the Office of Rail Transportation by May 2014.\n\nEstimated journey times for trains of the EIC Premium category\n\nRoute\n\nJourney time\n\nStations with a stop\n\nDecember 2014\n\nDecember 2014\n\nc. 3 hrs\n\nc. 2 hrs 15 mins.\n\n***\n\nOn EIC Premium. In May 2011 PKP Intercity and Alstom signed a contract for the delivery of 20 trains, the construction of a technical base at Warsaw Grochów and train technical support for around 17 years. The value of the trains themselves amounts to EUR 400 m. In January 2013 the foundation stone will be laid at the Service Center. The completion of construction is planned for December of this year.
