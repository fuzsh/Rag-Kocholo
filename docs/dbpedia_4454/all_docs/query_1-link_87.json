        "text": "Legal basis\n\nAdmission to the market and operation of the retaining trestle as well as other structures, equipment or vehicles is regulated by: \"Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Development of 13 May 2014 on the approval for operation of certain types of structures, equipment and railway vehicles. (Journal of Laws of 30 May 2014, item 720) Pursuant to Article 22f(14) of the Act of 28 March 2003 on Rail Transport. (Journal of Laws of 2013, item 1594 and 2014, item 644). According to the above-mentioned legal act, the obligation to obtain a type approval certificate results from the inclusion or not of a given object in: \"List of types of structures, equipment and railway vehicles for which it is required to obtain a type approval certificate.\" The said list can be found in Chapter 3 of the above-mentioned regulation. As a consequence of the fact that retaining trestles are not included in that list, there is no obligation and no possibility of holding a type-approval certificate for them. Despite this, guided by safety considerations and the need to confirm the technical correctness of the solutions used, we have carried out a number of tests and tests of our goat. The culmination of the whole process was the performance of final functional and strength tests at the Railway Research Institute in Warsaw, as a result of which we obtained the National Technical Assessment of our product, which in turn allowed us to obtain the possibility of assigning the B mark for retaining trestles."
