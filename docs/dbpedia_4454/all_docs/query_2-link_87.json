        "text": "Aligning Security Initiatives with Strategy\n\nAs security professionals, we have seen the landscape change. Cybersecurity is now more vital and relevant to the growth of your organization than ever before. As a result, information security teams have more visibility, more budget, and more opportunity. However, with this increased responsibility comes more scrutiny. This course gives you tools to become a security business leader who can build and execute strategic plans that resonate with other business executives, create effective information security policy, and develop management and leadership skills to better lead, inspire, and motivate your teams.\n\nPolicy is a manager's opportunity to express expectations for the workforce, set the boundaries of acceptable behavior, and empower people to do what they ought to be doing. These policies must be aligned with an organization's culture. In LDR514, we break down the steps to policy development so that you have the ability to design and assess policies that can successfully guide your organization.\n\nLeadership is a skill that must be learned, exercised, and developed to better ensure organizational success. Strong leadership is brought about primarily through selfless devotion to the organization and staff, tireless effort in setting the example, and having the vision to see and effectively use available resources toward the end goal. Effective leadership entails persuading team members to accomplish their objectives, removing the obstacles preventing them from doing it, and maintaining the well-being of the team in support of the organization's mission. LDR514 will teach you to use management tools and frameworks to better lead, inspire, and motivate your teams.\n\n\"Really helpful and aligned with my current need in security strategy within my organization. There wasn't a day or section that was not directly applicable to issues I'm facing and strategies to address them.\" - Scott Quenneville, American Transmission Company\n\nWhat Is Cyber Security Strategy?\n\nSimply put, strategy is the ability to get from one place to another in a beneficial way. Your job as a leader is to figure out how to do that for your business, your team, and yourself. You need a wide combination of skills that go beyond the technical nitty gritty to progress into a more senior leadership role and build rapport with executive leadership. This includes being able to build a strategic plan, conduct gap analysis, understand both the business and threat landscape, build a compelling business case, and create effective security policy. On top of all this you must ensure that your team can actually get the work done by leading, motivating, and inspiring them to actually WANT to get the work done. In summary, the ability to build a cybersecurity strategy will help you take the next step in your career, build higher performing teams, and align cybersecurity with business objectives.\n\nBusiness Takeaways\n\nThis course will help your organization:\n\nCreate a security plan that resonates with customers\n\nDevelop leaders that know how to align cybersecurity with business objectives\n\nBuild higher performing security teams\n\nSkills Learned\n\nHow to develop strategic security plans\n\nCreate effective information security policy\n\nUnderstand the different phases of the strategic planning process\n\nIncrease knowledge of key planning tools\n\nCultivate fundamental skills to create strategic plans that protect your company\n\nEnable key innovations\n\nFacilitate working effectively with your business partners\n\nAdvance security strategic plans that incorporate business and organizational drivers\n\nFoster and assess information security policy\n\nUse management and leadership techniques to motivate and inspire your team\n\nHands-On Cyber Security Strategy Training\n\nLDR514 uses business case studies, fictional companies, and the Cyber42 leadership simulation game to put you in real-world scenarios that spur discussion and critical thinking of situations that you will encounter at work.
