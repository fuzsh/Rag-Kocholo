        "text": "A contract canceled, the possible loss of subsidies, and a quick search for a new manufacturer. Three ingredients of the project “Impuls EMUs for SKM Warszawa”. Railcolor presents the first pictures and the backgrounds of this project:\n\nWe want to thank the press officer of SKM Warszawa, who shared the pictures by Bartek Banaszak with us.\n\nOn 12.01.2022, SKM presented the first two units in its workshop; the four-car 31WEba-001 and 31WEba-002. The order includes the delivery of fifteen five-car and six four-car EMUs. The order value amounts to PLN 668 million, of which EU funds cover one-third.\n\nSpecial colors\n\n31WEba-001 has an unusual design (SKM trains are generally red/ivory/yellow). Its blue wrap celebrates 2021 as the European year of railways once more, plus it’s the 200th train of the Impuls product family built by Newag in Nowy Sącz.\n\nTrain tests and planned routes\n\nRailcolor reported: the first 5-car train on the tracks of the Railway Institute in Zmigrod started in September 2021.\n\nThe new SKM trains need to complete 600 kilometers without defects before being put into service. They are scheduled to enter service on 01.03.2022. In the beginning, they will run on line S2 from Warsaw Chopin Airport to Sulejówek Miłosna. Subsequent EMUs will appear on the lines S1 Pruszków – Otwock and on the line S3 Warsaw West Station to Legionowo, Wieliszew, and Nieporęt.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe units have an interior set-up, typical for agglomeration traffic with many handrails. There are no toilets. The trains don’t travel that far as they stay in Warsaw and its vicinity. This solution allows for higher train capacity.\n\nLength: 91.9 m (5-car) & 75.6 m (4-car)\n\nMaximum speed: 160 km/h\n\nCapacity: 5-car version: 835 seats (186 seated), 4-car version: 680 (144 seated)\n\nAdditional Equipment: WiFi network, AED defibrillators, USB charger\n\nBoth the four- and five-cat units have eight places for bicycles and two places for strollers/wheelchairs.\n\nTender history\n\nInitially, Pesa would build the new trains, but SKM Warsaw terminated the contract. A first train was already completed, but the parties did not reach an agreement. A new contract with Newag was signed in April 2020. The production started in Q1 2021."
