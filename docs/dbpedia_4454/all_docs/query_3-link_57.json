        "text": "KRRI Holds Seminar on Future of Railway Undergrounding\n\n- Kills more than 99.9% SARS-CoV-2 in 1 second -UIWANG, South Korea – JUNE 19 – The Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) (President: Dr. Seok-Youn Han) held the Seminar on Today, the Future of Railway Undergrounding and the Integrated Development of Railway Yards jointly with the Korean Railway Construction Association and the Korean Railway Technology Society at KRRI’s Oh Myung Hall in Uiwang, Gyeonggi-do June 18th.The institute shared progress on the railway undergrounding project, the design of underground railways, the analysis of construction cases, and the current status of R&D.The seminar saw participation from more than 100 people from national and local government as well as businesses. The event highlighted the importance of urban development and environmental improvement resulting from railway undergrounding and development of upper space, and continued R&D and cooperation.During the seminar, KRRI introduced the current status of research and development as well as future plans for underground railways.Il-Hwa Lee, Principal Researcher at KRRI, gave a presentation on a technology for development of beyond-track space (BTS), which allows for railway undergrounding through construction of artificial ground, and station district-centric urban regeneration and restructuring. In particular, Lee suggested developing technologies that resolve barriers to developing underground space, including operational and structural safety and controlling noise and vibration levels.Dae Sang Kim, Principal Researcher at KRRI delivered a presentation on development of digital-based 3D visualization of railways in operation. Specifically, Kim introduced overseas uses of 3D visualization technologies, critical technology elements for 3D visualization of railways, and the current status of technological development. Kim also shared ongoing research activities including a technology securing hyper-proximity space for railway lines, a technology minimizing railway blockage time, and a digital twin-based safety assurance technology which needs to be developed.These were followed by presentations of Jae-Nam Yoo, Vice President of Yooshin Engineering Group on a case study of review for railway undergrounding at Seoul Station, and Young-Hee Kim, Head of Urban Space Planning Division at Seoul Metropolitan Government on Seoul Metropolitan Government’s basic direction of railway undergrounding and development of upper space.Vice President Yoo redefined the role of Seoul Station as a central station in Korea, with targets of building an integrated transfer system, enhancing the symbolism and publicity of Seoul Station, and integrating with and regenerating surrounding areas. Yoo also introduced space planning through improving Seoul Station’s railway functions; undergrounding sections linked to the Kyungbu Line and other options; integrating the allocation of railway lines; and measures to realize the railway undergrounding project.Division Head Kim presented the project goals and implementation system envisioned by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, which include transportation innovation, green space creation, fostering innovative central spaces, and urban space regeneration. These initiatives aim to enhance urban competitiveness and quality of life through the undergrounding and advancement of railway facilities, as well as the creation of three-dimensional spaces on railway sites.These were followed by a panel discussion featuring Seon Dong Park (Head of Railway Undergrounding & Integrated Development Division at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport), Jeong-Il Park (Head of Railway Undergrounding Division at Korea National Railway), Young-Hee Kim (Head of Urban Space Planning Division at Seoul Metropolitan Government), Jae-Nam Yoo (Vice President of Yooshin Engineering Group), Dae Sang Kim (Principal Researcher at KRRI), moderated by Sangkyo Seo, President of the Korean Railway Technology Society.Seon Dong Park, Head of Railway Undergrounding & Integrated Development Division at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, explained the importance of the railway undergrounding project to Korea and the current status, suggesting future directions for the government support. Jeong-Il Park, Head of Railway Undergrounding Division at Korea National Railway, introduced KNR’s undergrounding project plan.Dae Sang Kim, Principal Researcher at KRRI, presented the direction of advances in digital-based technology for multi-dimensional development of railways and its applicability, and Jeong Hyun Kim, Principal Researcher at KRRI, introduced future research plans and visions of the institute on this technology.“This seminar served as a venue where we can share the current status of and measures for development of technologies and budgeting, the two pillars of railway undergrounding,” said KRRI President Dr. Han. “KRRI is committed to promoting development of prestigious K-Rail Tech so that we can contribute to government policies on railway undergrounding and wellbeing of the public going forward.”※ Reference: Photos of the Seminar on Today and Future of Railway Undergrounding and Integrated DevelopmentPress ContactsYongmook KANGKorea Railroad Research Instituteymkang@krri.re.kr+82 31 460 5184\n\nKRRI Initiates Development of K-Rail RAM Open Platform for Railway Digital Transformation\n\nUIWANG, South Korea – JUNE 18 – The Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) (President: Dr. Seok-Youn Han) has begun developing a test bed of K-Rail RAM Open Platform at the Osong Comprehensive Railway Test Track.The K-Rail RAM Open Platform aims to improve competitiveness of the railway industry by providing a package of tools, guidance, and grounds required for RAMS activities in the life cycle of railways, thereby reducing the time needed to acquire international certification by railway companies.RAMS, which stands for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, is a technical requirement for railway systems. And the RAMS international standards certification has been incorporated into domestic and overseas contract requirements in all areas including facilities, power, railcar as well as signal communication.The Open Platform is going to post the RAMS status of reliable railway parts by setting RAMS targets of railway developers and operators and accumulating information on developing railway components and systems.In addition, the platform helps predict RAMS of electronic and mechanical parts, and improve predictive reliability through developing a FRACAS* module utilizing the operational failure history of facilities installed at the Osong Comprehensive Railway Test Track.* Failure Report Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS): Process and tools designed to report any failures of a product or system, analyze the causes, make improvements and prevent such failuresK-Rail RAM Open Platform collects the failure history of facilities installed at the Osong Comprehensive Railway Test Track through a communication network to approve reliability. To do this, KRRI plans to verify failure prediction technologies of the communication network using communication coverage of the network, failure diagnosis technologies, and other measures.KRRI is presenting its technologies on railway communication coverage, network failure diagnosis, and LTE-R connection at the Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences on June 19th.Since 2022, KRRI has conducted research on an AI-based platform for “development of a reliability prediction technology for railway parts in pursuit of railway digital transformation” and plans to complete development of K-Rail RAM Open Platform at the Osong Comprehensive Railway Test Track by 2025.※ Related research project- Title: Development of a railway parts open RAM technology based on the Osong Comprehensive Railway Test Track - Research period: January 2022 – December 2025 - Budget: KRW 9.7 billion (funded by the government) - Research institute: KRRI - Person in charge: Kang-mi Lee, Senior Researcher at Railway Designated Certificate Department, KRRI“KRRI will work closely with telecommunications companies in Korea to bring about meaningful research results of failure diagnosis and prevention in the field of railway communication technologies,” said Yongsoo Song, Senior Researcher at KRRI, who is responsible for LTE-R certification.“Our K-Railway RAM Platform technology will serve as core infrastructure for digital transformation of the railway industry, materializing Korea’s digital strategies,” said KRRI President Dr. Han. “KRRI will facilitate digital transformation of the railway industry through establishment and demonstration of the failure diagnosis system integrated with the K-Railway RAM Open Platform technology.”※ Reference: 1.
