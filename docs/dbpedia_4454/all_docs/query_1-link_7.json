        "text": "The Warsaw Railway Museum occupies some prime development land. Map courtesy Google Maps.\n\nFor some time now, it has been clear that PKP SA and the Warsaw Railway Museum were on a collision course. PKP bosses have wanted the Railway Museum to move to another location so that they could develop the former Warszawa Glowna land. It is PKP’s premium development site in the centre of Warsaw. Ferdinand Ruszczyc, the museum director and his staff do not want to move. The current location is comfortable for their commuting and, if there is going to be a profitable development, they feel the museum should share in any development premium going.\n\nIn July this year, Infrastructure Minister, Slawomir Nowak, refused a request from the museum to stay PKP’s hand with respect to starting court proceedings to expel the Museum. The first salvoes were fired in a Warsaw court this Tuesday (20 November). There will be several more sessions before the court reaches its decision. While it is totally unacceptable that PKP appears to shirk its responsibilities with respect to its history and heritage, it is difficult in this case not to have some sympathy with its position.\n\nThe current site is far from ideal. Locomotives and rolling stock are cramped together nose to tail and slowly rust away under open skys in the toxic city air. The Museum has had several years to develop a ‘Plan B’. That time has been frittered away in its dispute with PKP. Meanwhile the opportunity to create a world-class railway museum elsewhere with the aid of EU funding has slipped away. Projects which lack a minimum of five years security of tenure cannot be funded from EU funds. On Tuesday this week, the first legal salvoes were fired in Warsaw court.\n\nOne of several meetings organised by the Railway Museum to promote its own plans for the Warszawa Glowna Site. The PKP SA team state their position. Photo BTWT.\n\nAdam Struzik, the chief executive of Mazowsze province (the operators of the Museum), says that he has no money to fund the move of the rolling stock, nor to develop a new museum in another location. PKP are unapologetic, they are between a rock and a hard place and need to generate the maximum possible returns from the redevelopment of their redundant real estate. Any surplus left after making the scheduled yearly debt repayment, is desperately needed as ‘own funds’ for the next round of EU-funded investment projects.\n\nAs often is the case with problems that appear to be insoluble, the solution lies in some ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking. It seems unreasonable that all the burdens of running what is de facto a national railway museum should rest on the shoulders of the Mazowsze provincial government. The Mazowsze province includes the city of Warsaw and has much of its funds is committed to modernising the trunk transport infrastructure of the region.\n\nIf the province cannot fund the running of a proper national railway museum, then why not look to a more modest objective. If the city of Szczecin, which is hard up relative to Warsaw, can develop a municipal transport museum in an old tram depot, then why does the provincial and city government not work together to do the same? After all there is a tram depot complete with workshops and skilled staff less than half a kilometre from the current Museum site!\n\nThis would be a grand place to display limited collection of locomotives and rolling stock that have connections with the city and province as well as trams and road vehicles that have local links. Meanwhile time is fast running out for discussions with local government officials elsewhere as regards establishing a proper national railway museum worthy of Poland’s rich railway heritage and history.\n\nDyspozytor\n\nNote:\n\nThe PKP press office was asked for a comment regarding the company’s dispute with the Museum, but were unwilling to do so over the telephone.\n\nThe crisp morning air in Warsaw tempted me with some sight seeing. I hadn’t seen much of Warsaw in the past 6 years, and with clear blue skies and bright sunlight it was a nice day to be out and about.\n\nEmerging from the early morning mist, Stalin’s ‘gift’ to Warsaw, the Palace of Culture. Photo John Savery.\n\n(Click image to expand.)\n\nI had never visited the Warsaw Uprising Museum (Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego) so it was time to pay a visit. Situated a short distance up ul. Towarowa from the Warsaw Railway Museum, the museum is easy to find and to get to. The tram stop is just nearby, taking its title from the museum.\n\nArriving, it was clear it is popular with school visits. Purchasing a ticket from the kasa (ticket office) was easy enough, and armed with the souvenir I made my way across the courtyard to the entrance. With an attended cloakroom, I thought it would be easy enough to leave my small case (hand baggage sized) in the cloakroom, alas, this proved not to be the case and I was asked to leave it in the left luggage office opposite. Somewhat disconcerted I left the case as directed, surrounded by arriving tourists!\n\nOnce in the museum proper, it was clear why it was so popular. Aside from being a fitting tribute to those that fought for Warsaw in 1944, it is informative with plenty of exhibits and that all important human touch with life stories from people caught in the conflict. With dual translations in places, it was easy to understand. My only regret is that the was a long queue for the City of Ruins cinema showings so I didn’t get chance to view the film. Walking around it was easy to become immersed in the story finishing up outside at the wall of remembrance.\n\nThe Wall of Remembrance at the Warsaw Uprising Museum. Photo John Savery.\n\n(Click image to expand.)\n\nLeaving the museum I headed back down ul. Towarowa and called in to the Railway Museum (Muzeum Kolejnictwa w Warszawie) on the way back to Warszawa Centralna station. What a contrast! Walking up to the museum, with the outside door closed it was not clear if it was open or not. On entering, there was a lady stood behind a desk and in an adjacent room a man behind what looked liked a ticket sales window (although my Polish told me it wasn’t).\n\nOn asking for a ticket I was sent back to the lady in the adjacent room, who then directed me to and automatic vending machine. Inserting the correct change gave me a flimsy bit of paper more reminiscent of a parking ticket than the entrance to a museum. A complete contrast to my experience a few hours earlier.\n\nA nice and shiny ticket machine at the Warsaw Railway Museum. Photo John Savery.\n\n(Click image to expand.)\n\nWith the relevant piece of paper safely in my wallet I ventured inside only to be immediately stopped and asked for my ticket! It would seem that MK regard jobs for the boys (and girls) as more important than looking after its guests and exhibits. The dilapidated state of the locomotives stored outside is abysmal, and exposed to the weather they are quietly rusting away.\n\nSome renovation (painting) of exhibits is going on but it is a drop in the ocean to what is needed. Internally little seems to have changed since I last visited the museum in 2006. The internal displays are still dominated by models and there is little in the way of telling a story. The small section on the history of railways had two very familiar sections of Cuneo prints, neither of which credited the great artist.\n\nTy42-120 on display. The outdoor storage and display of the locomotives does little to stop the weather attacking the metal and paintwork. Photo John Savery.\n\n(Click image to expand.)\n\nSD80 railcar. The railcar was intact on arrival at the museum, however as it was stored outside of the museum’s compound, it was left at the mercy of vandals and thieves. Little more than a shell remains. (The bogies are out of shot of the camera.) Photo John Savery.\n\n(Click image to expand.)\n\nI left the museum disappointed. Not because it did not live up to expectations. The disappointment was because the Uprising Museum proved it is possible to have an excellent museum and draw visitors in, on a weekday, in the middle of a capital city. If the Railway Museum’s management team want to run a successful museum, they could do far worse than visiting their neighbour a few hundred metres up the road.\n\nThese Romanian trailers look as if they were never painted since they were put into service by PKP in the 1970s. Photo BTWT.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nI hate skansens. This Scandinavian invention may have a place in preserving rural architecture; although personally I have never seen the point of plucking a building from its historic context and and transporting it to an entirely artificial setting, however carefully designed and landscaped.\n\nApplied to the railway locomotives and rolling stock a skansen is a monstrous aberration condemning precision machinery and delicate woodwork to the ravages of its worst enemies: frost and water and a programme of accelerated decay.\n\nA rustic retreat? No, a historic four wheel covered wagon left to rot in the ‘skansen’. Photo BTWT.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nNowhere is the bankruptcy of the Polish railway skansen meme demonstrated so effectively as the narrow gauge railway skansen in Gryfice. Adjacent to a thriving narrow gauge railway operated by the most prosperous gmina in Poland is a collection of decaying rolling stock the likes of which have not been seen since the last steam locomotive left Barry scrapyard.\n\nSeen from the road the skansen looks neat and tidy with well-kept lawns trimmed bushes and locomotives which appear to be regularly repainted. Penetrate a little further and the condition of many priceless relics is heartbreaking.\n\nEx Grojecka Kolej Dojazdowa motor coach MBxd1-359 heads a line of rotting metre gauge motor coaches and trailers. Photo BTWT.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nThe tragedy is that this need not have been so. The Gryfice workshops of the Pomeranian Narrow Gauge Railways were extensive and could easily have provided covered accommodation for much of this rolling stock. But someone decided that most of the accommodation was ‘surplus to requirements’.\n\nSomeone also decided that it would be inappropriate for Gmina Rewal to hold on to all the historic rolling stock left behind after the closure of the Pomeranian metre gauge network and it would be in better hands (= would provide more opportunities for private profit) if the bulk of the collection was retained by the Railway Museum in Warsaw.\n\nUnidentified Romanian trailer, Vulcan Werke 0-6-2T of 1928 Tyn-3632, and a transporter wagon. Photo BTWT.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nAnd so it was that the Piaseczno and Gryfice narrow gauge railways were deprived of their own rolling stock and locomotives and had to stand idly by while part of their heritage rotted away.\n\nEventually, the authorities running the Railway Museum in Warsaw, embarrassed by the state of the items in their custody, and realising that – because of fuss stirred up by several infamous cases of dodgy sales elsewhere – the eagle eyes of Polish railway enthusiasts were upon them, decided to hand over the skansen to the Szczecin branch of the National Museum.\n\nUnfortunately the Museum does not have the funds available to arrest the decay in the skansen, an in fact, has serious problems with its own collection of historic wooden fishing vessels which – displayed outdoors in Szczecin – have decayed so much that they are in danger of falling apart.\n\n(left to right) Px48-3912, Tx7-3501, Tx7-3502, Ty6-3284, Txn8-3811, Px48-3916, Ty-9785.\n\nPhoto BTWT.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nGmina Reval, the owners of the Gryfice Narrow Gauge railway now renamed the Nadmorska Kolej Waskotorowa (Coastal Narrow Gauge Railway), have made a bid to the National Museum to take over and restore the collection of historic fishing vessels. Is it too much to hope that they might bid to provide a better home for the skansen rolling stock as well?\n\nVandalised Bxhpi 00-450044328-0 trailer next to an unidentified trailer in Gryfice yard. Photo BTWT.\n\n(Click to enlarge.)\n\nPostscript\n\nSadly the EU-assisted project to upgrade the Gryfice Narrow Gauge Railway, while providing for a brand new station buildings and several covered platform awnings (where they had never been awnings before) did not envisage providing secure covered accommodation for the railway’s rolling stock. The effect of this can be seen in the act of wanton vandalism shown on the photograph above.\n\nDyspozytor\n\nA development vision prepared for the Railway Museum in Warsaw. Sketches Chief Executive’s Office Government of Mazowse Province.\n\nThe dispute between PKP SA and the Railway Museum in Warsaw continues. A short-term deal has been agreed allowing the museum to remain on its current site adjacent to ul. Towarowa for another three years. The museum has lost its rent free status and is obliged to pay rent for its occupancy of the site – though not at the level originally demanded by the landowners, PKP SA.\n\nThe dispute concerns the long-term location of the museum. PKP SA want the entire former Warszawa Glowna station site cleared for development and have suggested a number of alternate locations both within and outwith Warsaw’s city limits. The museum’s management team want to remain on the existing site.\n\nIn order to convince PKP SA’s estate department that the development of the land and the development of the museum could go hand in hand on the existing site the Museum authorities have commissioned a design team to prepare some visualisations of what such a hybrid development could look like. But the railway company’s estate team are far from convinced and a spokesman pointed out that the PKP SA is sticking to its demand that the museum vacates the Warsawa Glowna site by 2013.\n\nIt seems that PKP SA’s estates chief Pawel Olczyk and Railway Museum director, Ferdynand Ruszczyc, are playing a game of musical chairs with both bosses counting on the fact that nether will be in post when the 2013 deadline expires. A deal to secure the long-term future of Poland’s de facto national railway museum will require courage and out-of-the-box thinking from all concerned. Until that happens the future of the museum and its priceless collection will remain in jeopardy.\n\nBackground:\n\nBTWT – previous articles about the Railway Museum in Warsaw\n\nAndrew Scott, Director of the National Museum of Science and Industry, investigates the parentage of the ex Krakow Waterworks engine on 28.11.2009.\n\nFerdynand Ruszczyc, the Director of the Railway Museum in Warsaw, has not been having a good month. Last week he was asked to resign from his other job, director of the office coordinating the Chopin 2010 festivities. On 28th November Gazeta Stoleczna, the Warsaw supplement to Poland’s best selling daily Gazeta Wyborzca, carried an article under the headline Muzeum Kolejnictwa jak prowincjonalny dom kultury? (Railway Museum like a provincial arts centre?) which questioned Mr Ruszczyc’s approach to running the Railway Museum. Mr Ruszczyc responded by demanding that Gazeta Wyborcza print an apology and threatening the authors of the article with legal action; the next day he read in the same paper that Ludwig Rakowski the Deputy Governor of Mazowsze province has ordered an investigation into the way that the Railway Museum is being run.\n\nWhy the firestorm? Some Warsaw railway enthusiasts allege that Ruszczyc is more interested in promoting himself than the Railway Museum and that money that he has spent on art exhibitions and fashion shows would have been better spent on restoring his exhibits. The final straw for them was when Ruszczyc moved outside a small industrial locomotive that had graced the Museum’s entrance lobby for many years. The locomotive – a tiny 1920s vintage single cylinder diesel similar in appearance to the small industrial engines manufactured by Orenstein & Koppel A.G. – is the oldest such locomotive in Poland.\n\nHowever, the simplistic analysis is almost certainly wrong. Under Ruszczyc’s predecessor, Janusz Sankowski, who sat in the director’s chair for 17 years, certain priceless exhibits ended up as gutted wrecks or were even cut up for scrap, while the Museum itself faded into obscurity. The popular press ignored the affairs of the Museum and the demise of its exhibits. In comparison to Sankowski, Ruszczyc has been a breath of fresh air. The Museum has been given a coat of paint. A number of special events have been held in the Museum to raise its public profile. A special educational programme has been put together for school visits. A delegation from the Museum visited the NRM in York to see how railway museums were run in Great Britain.\n\nSo why is Ruszczyc getting such a bad press? One theory that is doing the rounds – albeit there is only circumstantial evidence to back it up – is that Ruszczyc is doing too good a job. PKP has decided that it is time to dislodge the Railway Museum from its Warszawa Glowna location – a prime development site and the Museum is fighting for its survival. Ruszczyc has dug in his heels to stay at the Warszawa Glowna site, engaging Greogorz Gomula a brilliant young Warsaw lawyer, to defend the Museum’s position. He has received some useful support in his campaign from the British – Polish Railway and Industrial Heritage partnership – a pro heritage rail lobbying group – who have coordinated a letter writing campaign which resulted in letters of support for the Railway Museum from some influential supporters in Europe. These letters in turn encouraged a couple of Polish ministers to declare their support for the Museum. Connecting the dots it would appear that somebody who stands to make some big money from the Warszawa Glowna development has decided that Ruszczyc has to go.\n\nVIPs at Smigiel. Left to right: Marek Ciesielski, Andrew Scott, David Morgan, Tomasz Strapagiel, Karol Waszczak and Gordon Rushton. The driver looks down from the open door.\n\nTheory number two is that Krzystof Chalupinski, who has been the Museum’s Deputy Director for many years, covets the top job himself and has calculated that if Ruszczyc is disgraced, he has a good chance of landing it himself. It is certainly is true that those people who have told us their doubts about Ruszczyc also regularly talk to Chalupinski. It would also appear that Chalupinski has been conspicuous by his absence at the recent special events organised by his boss in the Museum. Perhaps, the strongest evidence that Chalupinski is playing a devious game, is his strange behaviour with respect to the Railway Heritage and Society conference recently organised in Warsaw by the British Polish Chamber of Commerce and Fundacja Era Parowozow. Adressing the conference would have been a great opportunity for Ruszczyc to face his critics and to explain his strategy for raising the Museum’s profile. At first, all boded well. Ruszczyc agreed to speak at the conference and that the Museum would make a small donation towards the secretarial costs of organising the event. The Museum was also to appear as co-organiser of the event. Mr Ruszczyz even wrote to Andrew Scott, the Director of the National Museum of Science and Industry inviting him to come to Warsaw and give a presentation. In the event Mr Chalupinski persuaded Mr Ruszczyc to renege on all his promises and all but ignore the event. Mr Ruszczyc never met Andrew Scott and all the other VIPs who specially came to Warsaw, and it was left to Paul Fox, the Deputy British Ambassador, and Tomasz Strapagiel, the Chairman of SKPL to provide the distinguished visitors with the welcome that they deserved.\n\nIt may be that neither of the two theories outlined above is true, it is also equally possible that both are true. However, one thing is certain – Mr Ruszczyc’s behaviour shocked the VIPs who came to Warsaw because they wished to help him to save his Museum and its collection.\n\nDyspozytor\n\nSources (in Polish):\n\nGazeta W. – Muzeum Kolejnictwa jak prowincjonalny dom kultury\n\nMuzeum Kolejnictwa – Komunikat Dyrektora\n\nGazeta W. – Marszałek sprawdzi co się dzieje w Muzeum Kolejnictwa\n\nOne of the exhibits of the Railway Museum in Warsaw, the private coach of Boleslaw Bierut, president of Poland 1947-52 (following rigged elections), first secretary of the Communist Party 1948-56, who maintained a Stalinist reign of terror until his death in Moscow in 1956.

They had demanded that the Museum quits its premises by the end of August, and had threatened to cut off the museum’s hot water supply and to demolish some of the museum’s buildings. Stung by the resulting hostile press coverage, PKP’s negotiators are now adopting a more conciliatory approach.\n\nThey suggested that the Museum and PKP sign a commercial lease which would enable the Museum to stay on its existing site until the Museum’s new location was ready. The agreement would run from 1 September for a maximum term of 2 years. PKP are claiming that the Museum’s occupancy of the station site has costed them 4 million zloty (£850,000) to date and is costing them 26,000 zloty (£5,500) each month.\n\nPKP wants the Museum to relocate to a plot in the Praga district of Warsaw, not far from Warszawa Wilenska station. The plan would be for PKP to hand the land over to the City Council in settlement of unpaid local taxes. City authorities are reported to be resisting the proposal. Ferdynand Ruszczyc estimates that relocating the collection and building a new museum could cost between 50 and 70 million zloty (£10.6 – £14,8 million). Neither he, nor the provincial government, has such funds at their disposal.\n\nPKP has terminated the Museum’s licence to occupy Warsawa Glowna station effective 31st August. What will happen to the Museum after that? At the moment the battle is being fought in the pages of the Warsaw press and in smoke-filled rooms in government offices.

Stung by the negative publicity, PKP’s PR department started a damage limitation exercise and issued their own press release on Friday afternoon. It really does not need any further comment from ourselves!\n\nInformation on the site provided free of charge to the Railway Museum in Warsaw\n\nPolish State Railways S.A. – the owner of the former Warsawa Glowna station site at ul. Towarowa – 1 is preparing to use this land for the purpose of railway investment. PKP SA has been taking court action against a number of bodies, who have been preventing the site from being exploited commercially. The claims of the third parties have now been disposed by court decisions favourable to PKP SA. This clears the way for the development of this part of Warsaw.\n\nPolish State Railways S.A. has allowed the Railway Museum (an organisation funded by the local government of Mazowsze province) to use this site on a free of charge license since 1996. PKP SA – in accordance with its strategy for its land holdings – is obliged to rent land at this location, only and exclusively, on a commercial basis.\n\nFor these reasons PKP SA terminated the Railway Museum’s current license in July 2009. This does not preclude the Railway Museum from obtaining a lease of the property on a commercial basis until the the Museum has been transferred to another location.\n\nThe termination of the license and the need to transfer the Museum to another location was previously discussed with the bodies responsible for the Museum. In October 2008, PKP SA and the authorities of the provincial government (the Governor and a senior official) signed a memorandum in which it was specified that the Museum will be relocated from its current location to a site provided by PKP SA on Grodzienska street in Warsaw (near the junction of Grodzienska street and Radzyminska street) with an area of 1.8 hectares [4.45 acres ed].\n\nRepresentatives of the local authority and the Railway Museum were again informed about the importance of relocating the museum at a meeting which took place on 16 April 2009 between representatives of PKP SA and the local government of Mazowsze province. On 25 June 2009, once again PKP SA informed the provincial authorities of the necessity to relocate the Museum to the site being made available by PKP SA.\n\nPolish State Railways supports the Railway Museum in carrying out its functions. This is reflected in the agreements that have been in place up to now between the two parties and the technical assistance PKP SA has provided to assist the running the Museum. The need to regulate the legal status of PKP’s real estate PKP SA and its use for development does not permit the free use of a plot of land of over 7 hectares [17.3 acres ed.] in the heart of Warsaw. PKP SA maintains regular contact with the Museum and the local government.\n\nDon’t miss tomorrow’s exciting instalment – ‘Reading between the lines’."
