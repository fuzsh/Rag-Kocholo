        "text": "The world has lost an extraordinary person. Susan was not just an incredible leader at Google and YouTube, she was also one of the most thoughtful and conscientious people I have ever been blessed to work with. She approached the challenges we face online — from toxicity in the conversation to the spread of extremism and disinformation — with the deepest humanity. She didn’t just do this at a distance. When Kabul fell to the Taliban, she took it upon herself to ensure that the women and men who had used the platform to lean into their rights, did not get caught in the regressive trajectory of the country. For months on end she was relentless in making sure they were ok and we found a way to get them to safety. And once they were safe in Albania, she didn’t forget about them. She went to visit. I worked with Susan for nearly 14 years and had always been impressed by her endless list of admirable attributes, but in that moment her humanity radiated and will forever sit with me. https://lnkd.in/eGMu7nHw\n\nWe are in a profound era geopolitical, technological, and economic transformation. Last year, we launched the Goldman Sachs Global Institute to provide our clients a deep and immediate understanding of these emerging trends, how they impact global markets, and ultimately their organizations. To help meet this challenge, we are seeking an exceptional Senior Analyst to join our team and play crucial role in advising our clients on navigating these complex issues. This individual will conduct in-depth research to identify trends, emerging risks, and opportunities at the intersection geopolitics, emerging technologies such as AI, and capital markets. They will work across Goldman Sachs’ divisions to support a wide range of projects and produce high-quality presentations, research reports and white papers, and briefings. It is an exceptional opportunity to work at the forefront of the most critical issues of our time. https://lnkd.in/eC9ZgcNy\n\nWhat the president says and writes has changed American history from the beginning. Given we tell our children to “use their words”, I wanted to draw on that idea and write a children’s book to tell America’s story. It’s finally done, and just in time for the start of the school year and the presidential election! Speaking of America: United States Presidents and Words That Changed History takes one line spoken or written by every president — covering topics from war and peace, to civics and freedom — describes what was happening in the country at the time, what they meant, and how the message had an impact. It also offers a fun fact about each president – Martin Van Buren spoke Dutch at home and William McKinley had a pet parrot named Washington Post that could whistle “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” who knew? This is the book I wish I had when I was a kid and that I want to read to my own children. They need to learn history and civics, why they should be proud of America, where we have fallen short of our ideals, and how we’ve worked to become a more perfect union. I also wanted to write an American history book that would be engaging, fun, filled with lessons, and through which we adults can get our own refresher while teaching our children. The book comes out September 10 (Ages 8+) and you can pre-order here: https://click.gs.com/7jn9\n\nAdvances in AI have the potential to lead to increased economic productivity and growth, create new tools for expression and suppression, and alter the balance of power in East Asia. Three important players in AI innovation are U.S. allies or partners in East Asia – Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Collectively, they account for a large proportion of global advanced semiconductor production, and AI has put the region at the center of today’s global technology competition. Below, my colleague Sam Morgan and I dive into the opportunities and risks in Asia as well as the pillars that are critical to any country’s AI strategy.\n\nIt’s been 80 years, a period of historic global growth, since the Bretton Woods Conference established the US dollar as the central pillar of the world economy and of US economic statecraft – but for eight decades, commentators have been predicting that the dollar’s imminent demise is coming. That debate has always missed the mark. No currency in history has performed the same function as the USD, and at this point there are no alternatives that can. But the US’s competitors – and even some partners – are still pushing the boundaries of the financial system at a time when the dollar still dominates and provides enormous benefits, but the post-Cold War consensus is breaking down. What would it take for another country to position its currency as an alternative to the USD? A world-leading, growing economy. Deep, liquid capital markets and trusted financial institutions. Financial safe havens and reliable mediums of exchange and store of value. The USD’s position isn’t guaranteed to last forever – but until another country can replicate those conditions, they won’t create a viable alternative. These efforts will be marginal, but meaningful in a world that’s getting more competitive, and where every advantage matters. See my latest in Foreign Policy where I cover today’s most notable efforts to de-dollarize, including new technologies, sector-specific arrangements, and shifting bilateral and multilateral alignments, where they’ve gained ground, and where and why they’ve fallen short."
