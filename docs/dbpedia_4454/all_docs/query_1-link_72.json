        "text": "The electric traction department is a part of the Electrotechnical Institute and was founded in 1946. For 60 years the traction department has been successfully involved in most rail, tramcar and trolleybus projects in Poland.\n\nElectrical traction equipment\n\nOur main activity is the design and production of propulsion power converters, auxiliary traction converters, vehicle control systems and other electrical equipment for tramcars, trolleybuses, high power and shunting locomotives, local trains, rail buses and light trains. We also run our own R&D department, which works in several fields of traction including power converters, electrical machines and stray current analysis. Our laboratory is certified for testing all electrical traction equipment to be used in Poland.\n\nDuring last few years our products and systems have been installed in many vehicles including:\n\nTramcar type 105N2k – 140pcs (choppers and control systems)\n\nLocomotive type EM10 – 4pcs (choppers and control systems)\n\nLocomotive type EL2 – 10pcs (choppers and static converters)\n\nLocomotive EP09 – 47pcs (electrodynamic braking system)\n\nTrolleybus type PR110 and Solaris – 12pcs (choppers and control systems)\n\nTramcar type 105N – 300pcs (fast circuit breakers)\n\nTramcar type 105N (refurbished) – 30pcs (choppers and inverters)\n\nTramcar type 116N – hybrid battery powered supply\n\nSeveral other types of tramcar – static converters\n\nTraction vehicle design and production\n\nWe design and manufacture the following equipment for the new production and refurbishment of traction vehicles:\n\nDC propulsion converters (choppers) for DC motors (up to 5MW)\n\nAC propulsion converters for three-phase asynchronous motors (up to 1MW)\n\nStatic / auxiliary converters for traction vehicles\n\nVehicle / train control and diagnostic systems\n\nBatteries – ultra-capacitor energy storage systems for tramcars / locomotives\n\nGPS and GPRS control system technology for traction vehicles\n\nDriver MMI communication systems\n\nUIC557 diagnostics systems on passenger rolling stock\n\nElectrodynamic braking systems for locomotives\n\nCorrosion protection systems for metros, cables, tubes and pipelines\n\nTransformers for static converters, reactors, chokes and EMC power filters\n\nFast hybrid circuit breakers for tramcars\n\nAnti-slip / skid devices for traction\n\nTraction automatic test stands for electric motors, and power and static converters\n\nOther non-typical devices and systems can be produced to customer specifications.\n\nElectrotechnical research and development\n\nProducts currently being studied by our research and development team include a new type of high-power traction drive (propulsion), onboard static / auxiliary converters, stray current analysis and cathodic corrosion protection.\n\nTesting laboratory and certification\n\nOur laboratory is well equipped with the highest class of measurement equipment and power supply for testing 600VDC, 750VDC, 1,500VDC, and 3,000VDC up to 3MW traction equipment. Our laboratory performs tests according to international railway and traction standards and work complies with the European ISO9001:2001."
