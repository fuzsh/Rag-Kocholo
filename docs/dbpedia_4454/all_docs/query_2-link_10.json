        "text": "The Wannsee Conference was held on January 20, 1942, in Berlin, to coordinate the implementation of the proposed \"Final Solution.\" At Wannsee, the SS estimated that the \"Final Solution\"—which was already under way—would ultimately involve 11 million European Jews. Nazi planners envisioned the inclusion of Jews living in neutral or non-occupied countries such as Ireland, Sweden, Turkey, and Great Britain.\n\nDeportations on this scale required the coordination of numerous German government ministries and state organizations, including the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), the Transport Ministry, and the Foreign Office. The RSHA coordinated and directed the deportations; the Transport Ministry organized train schedules; and the Foreign Office negotiated with German-allied states about handing over their Jews.\n\nThe Germans used both freight and passenger cars for the deportations. They did not provide the deportees with food or water, even when the transports had to wait days on railroad spurs for other trains to pass. The people deported in sealed freight cars suffered from intense heat in summer, freezing temperatures in winter, and the stench of urine and excrement. Aside from a bucket, there were no provisions for sanitary requirements. Without food or water, many deportees died before the trains reached their destinations. Armed guards shot anyone trying to escape. Between the fall of 1941 and the fall of 1944, millions of people were transported by rail to the killing centers and other killing sites in German-occupied Poland and the occupied Soviet Union.\n\nDimensions of the Railway Car on Display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nThere were many different kinds of railway cars used for deportations, varying in size and weight. The railway car on display in the Museum's Permanent Exhibition is of just one type used.\n\nTo give a sense of how the railway cars varied in size, we have provided the dimensions of the railway car on display along with the dimensions of the average freight car used for deportations in Hungary. It is not certain that the rail car on display in the Museum's Permanent Exhibition was used for the deportation of human beings, but it is typical of the type of rail car used in deportations from the German Reich.\n\nDimensions of the railway car on display:\n\nTotal length 31 feet 6 inches (9.6 meters); interior space for deportees 26 feet 2 inches (8 meters).\n\nTotal height 14 feet (4.3 meters) from the bottom of the wheel to the highest point of the car; interior space for deportees (ceiling curves down from the middle): 7 feet 4 inches (2.2 meters ) at the center; 7 feet (2.1 meters) at the sides.\n\nTotal width 10 feet 1 inch (3.1 meters, including the roofing); interior space for deportees: 8 feet 10 inches (2.7 meters).\n\nDimensions of the average freight car used for deportations in Hungary:\n\nLength: 26.8 feet (8.2 meters)\n\nWidth: 7.2 feet (2.2 meters)\n\nSource for Hungarian railway car dimensions: Randolph L. Braham, The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, Volume 1 (New York: The Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies, 1994), p. 686.\n\nNote for Teachers"
