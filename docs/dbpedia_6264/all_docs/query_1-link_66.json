        "text": "Musical artist\n\nDoug Lawrence (born October 11, 1956) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist from Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence, the youngest of six children, was born into a musical family in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[1] His father and two of his older three brothers were professional musicians who worked and recorded with Jack Teagarden, Elvis Presley, Ike and Tina Turner, Edgar Winter, The Righteous Brothers, Louis Bellson and others, and both of his sisters played musical instruments.[2] His mother was a dancer and played piano. Lawrence graduated high school from Highland High School (Albuquerque, New Mexico) and studied music at North Texas State University, the University of New Mexico and was a member of the Jazz Knights, a jazz ensemble of the West Point Band.[3][4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence spent over 25 years in New York City, collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Roy Eldridge, Nancy Wilson (jazz singer), Joe Williams (jazz singer), Teri Thornton, Benny Goodman and others.[5] He has also recorded with many prominent jazz musicians such as Buck Clayton, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Wild Bill Davis, Hank Jones, Mel Lewis, Frank Wess, Grover Mitchell, Loren Schoenberg, Butch Miles and Jimmy Cobb as well as recording six albums as a leader - \"Soul Carnival\",[6] \"High Heel Sneakers\",[7] \"Big Band Swing\"[8] \"Street Wise\"[9] and \"Doug Lawrence and Friends\".[10] Lawrence served in the West Point Band's Jazz Knights in the early 1980s as the lead tenor saxophonist.\n\nLawrence has been a featured performer at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, the Village Vanguard, the Walt Disney Concert Hall and at international concert halls and jazz festivals including the Sydney Opera House, the Moscow International House of Music, the Blue Note Tokyo, Telluride Jazz Celebration and the North Sea Jazz Festival. Since 1996 Lawrence has been, and is currently, the featured tenor saxophone soloist with the Count Basie Orchestra. In 2020 Lawrence began working with the iconic organist Joey DeFrancesco in DeFrancesco's \"Tenor Madness\" band. After Mr DeFrancesco's untimely death on August 25, 2022, the band briefly continued on with Dan Trudell taking Mr DeFrancesco's place on organ. This band featured longtime Harry Connick Jr. tenor saxophonist Jerry Weldon and Lawrence in a quartet or quintet setting. [11] Lawrence also works regularly with pianist George Cables among others. [12] Lawrence leads his own Trio, Quartet, Quintet or Sextet as well as a latin jazz band called Doug Lawrence y Su Nuevo Mexicanos.[13] Lawrence frequently appears as guest clinician and artist-in-residence at universities and jazz camps around the world.[14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence lives in New Mexico, USA.[15]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs leader\n\n[edit]\n\nSoul Carnival (Fable/Lightyear/WEA 1997)\n\nHigh Heel Sneakers (Fable/Lightyear/WEA 1998)\n\nBig Band Swing (Black Orchid 2001)\n\nStreet Wise (AllTribe 2002)\n\nDoug Lawrence New Organ Trio (Cactus 2014)\n\nDoug Lawrence and Friends (Junkie Jazz 2021)\n\nAs sideman\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Allen, Gone with the Wind (JazzInn 1999)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, All About That Basie (Concord 2018)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, A Very Swinging Basie Christmas (Concord 2015)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, Ella 100: Live At The Apollo (Concord 2020)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, Late Night Basie (Primary Wave Music 2023)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, Live At Birdland (Candid 2021)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, Live in Japan (Sony 2006)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, Singing, Swinging, Playing (Mack Avenue 2009)\n\nCount Basie Orchestra, The Count Basie Orchestra Swings The Blues (Candid 2023)\n\nHinton Battle, Meets the Count Basie Orchestra (Sony 2013)\n\nTony Bennett, A Swingin' Christmas (Columbia 2008)\n\nIsrea Butler, Congo Lament (Vegas 2024)\n\nRay Charles, Ray Sings, Basie Swings (Concord 2007)\n\nJames Chirillo, The Doug Lawrence Trio (DoLaDi 1981)\n\nBuck Clayton, A Swingin' Dream (Stash 1989)\n\nBuck Clayton, Live at the Village Vangauard (Nagel Hayer 1991)\n\nBuck Clayton, New York Ballads (Nagel Hayer 2020)\n\nBuck Clayton, Swings The Village (Nagel Hayer 2002)\n\nRosemary Clooney, Live At Ravinia (PBS/WTTW 2001)\n\nTony Corbiscello, In Full Swing (Allanna 1999)\n\nJamie Cullum, The Pursuit (Verve 2009)\n\nWild Bill Davis Trio, Live At The West End (WKCR 1990)\n\nMassamo Faraò, Body and Soul featuring Doug Lawrence (Azzua 2023)\n\nMassamo Faraò, The Great Saxophone Jazz Lounge featuring Doug Lawrence and Jerry Weldon (Azzura 2023)\n\nNneenna Freelon, Blueprint of a Lady (Concord 2005)\n\nJeff Jeroloman and George Cables, Swing Thing (Candid 1993)\n\nGeorge V.
