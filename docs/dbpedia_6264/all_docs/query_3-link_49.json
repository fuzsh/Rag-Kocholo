        "text": "The MacDaddy Experience or Ode to the Palm-Wine Drinkard\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, but these were the times of Wine. It flowed like Black Magic and it spilled into the streets. Wine represented high times for Black culture, consciousness and politics. It was the mid 70’s, a time when Black music, dance and theatre was flowing from every corner of New York City. There was a rich new cultural renaissance on the horizon, which started in the late 1960s and swept the country, from New York to Los Angeles, all points north, south and a few in between. The abundance of this inspiring new theatre fed the masses and gave Black folks choices as they packed the halls of entertainment with great enthusiasm. The generous grape vines of federal and corporate funding were loaded with sources and a hungry public demanded more as new theatre groups sprang forth, and thrived.\n\nIn NYC from Harlem to the Lower East Side, to Brooklyn, there were at least thirty different theatre companies. On any given night there were fifteen to twenty black theatre productions to choose, from Robert MacBeth’s New Lafayette Theatre, Roger Furman’s New Heritage Theatre, Al Fann’s Theatrical Ensemble, in Harlem, Garland Thompson’s The Frank Silvera Writers Workshop in mid-town, Douglas Turner Ward, Gerald Krone and Bobby Hooks’ Negro Ensemble Company, Buddy Butler’s Theatre Black, of which I was Vice-President, and Woodie King, Jr’s New Federal Theatre in the East Village and Lower East Side. Hell, on any night, there were at least two or three Black productions running at the New York Shakespeare Festival, just around the corner from NEC, which was constantly pumping out epic folk plays, like Errol Hill’s Man Batter Man, Wole Soyinka’s Kongi’s Harvest, and Derek Walcott s’ Dream on Monkey Mountain.\n\nJoseph Papp had such a passion for Black theatre that he produced very new, exciting, and sometimes, controversial black plays in his theatres, from Lincoln Center to Broadway and at the Shakespeare Festival. He was bold enough to produce a very explosive revolutionary play by Richard Wesley, entitled “Black Terror”. “Black Terror’ was originally produced by WASTSA! Theatre Group, an ensemble company which I co-founded with a group of students while attending Howard U. The Point is; all of this wine flowed at the same time. I mean, folks were in the streets and work was plentiful for Black performers. Jazz and dance was at its apex. New Jersey had Imamu Baraka and his Spirit House Movers in Newark, Brooklyn had Delano Stewart’s Bed-Stuy Theatre, the Billie Holiday Theatre and the dynamic soldier, and friend, brother Yusef Iman, with his incredible family of Boot Dancers, musicians and storytellers.\n\nBroadway turned out exciting Black musical productions, such as “Bubbling Brown Sugar”, “Purlie”, “Don’t Bother Me I Can’t Cope,” “Raisin” and “Ain’t Suppose to Die A Natural Death”, of which I am proud to admit that I was a young, excited and a willing participant. It gave me the opportunity to work all of the folks I was close to and learned from, like Dick (Big Time Buck White) Anthony Williams and his wife, Gloria, Bill Duke, Garrett Morris, Joe Fields, Arthur French, Mama Minnie Gentry, Carl Gordon, Cleabert Ford, Barbara (Lillie Did the Zampogiooooogi) Alston, Joe Fields, Gloria Schultz, Madge Wells, Albert Hall, Jimmy Hayerson, Ralph Wilcox, Tony Brealand and the fabulous Ms. Bea Winde. Working with this group of poets, prophets and storytellers, I learned something new everyday about life, living and the tricks of the trade. It was a Total Ensemble Theatre experience. Buy the way, I must admit… and quiet as it was kept… the “Ain’t…” concept was originally created, and directed by one of my former instructors at Howard University, Professor Paul Carter Harrison (remember that name). He conceived and directed the show while teaching at Sacramento State University, in California. Now, “Ain’t…” was a high point for me and for theatre in New York at that time because “the joint was really Jumpin’”. I was a young “whipper snapper”, a couple of years out of Howard University, a farther, attending graduate school at NYU, performing with Theatre Black, designing lighting and doing technical theatre between NEC, New Federal Theatre at Henry Street and the New York Shakespeare Festival… and at most times… at the same time. Buddy (Putney Swope) Butler, my former roommate, from HU and NY, and I were the technical wizards, but Ed Burbridge was “The Man”. All of this activity was within walking distance from NYU.\n\nCUT TO: A few years later and a brief lull in the action, around the early Spring of 74’. I was coming out of a record shop on St. Marks Ave. down in the East Village-Low. I ran into a friend who told me he had just come from an audition at the NEC, just around the corner. I asked… “What was the title of the play?” He said, “Man it was a wild piece called “The Great MacDaddy”, by some dude name Paul Harrison, he was upstairs right now with Doug” on the third flo”. I asked him if he knew who Paul Carter Harrison was. He said, “No, but cat wrote some crazy $#!% with some way out wit, about Shine and Stackolee and them”. I asked him, “Did he make it?” He said, “Man, I couldn’t shake, cause’ it was a bit to out there for me”. I told him I knew Paul, he was one my teachers at The Hall, and he said “Then you better run up and talk to him. Now I knew that Paul had also developed the MacDaddy tale while he was at Sac State, and it was destined to be a big hit. In fact, his history and his works were part of my Masters thesis while attending the University of the Streets… I mean NYU, just down the street. It was a matter of timing and the stars aligning, cause’ the public had to be hip and ready for this. Paul and I go back to HU, where he introduced to us to his Drama of Nommo, and Do.\n\nYou see, the Black oral tradition is about myth and superstition, the marchings, the struggles and the Souls of Black Folk, from heaven to perdition. Mischief makers, heart breakers, cradle shakers and soul takers, like Robert Johnson at the Crossroads of life. These were tall tales left us by slaves, prisoners and old men in baggy dungarees, smoking Bull Durham tobacco in their home made corn cob pipes while swigging on bottles of Jack Danials or White Lightnin’. It was called lyin’ and signifyin’ on street corners, back porches, and barber shops, like Iceberg Slim, Willie Best, Oscar Brown, Jr. and nem. At least that’s the way it was where I came from. You see, our history was not written, by us, but passed on orally from generation to generation. In passing these tales on, the stories got longer, the myth got stronger and the hero got bigger and bad-er. I cut my teeth listening to these tales while growing up in Anderson, South Carolina. It was the rap of our generation, our way of preserving a nation, while wondering far, far away from home. It is a journey for young men to remember and pass on to their gender… sons… to be keepers of the eternal flame and masters of the MacDaddy game. One lesson you learn real early; if you messin’ with another man’s Shirley. The tongue is only six inches long, yet it can destroy a man six feet tall. If you couldn’t fight and were a bit too light, you had to be fleet of foot and quick out of sight. These tales also helped to prevent young men from becoming all limp in the wrist…and Do. It is a lost art, a protective coating, the ability to blab, the gift of gab, the battle between good, bad, the almost had, the battle between mischief and the Devil. The “Bad” in this case meant “Cool”… Like, “I know where light goes when you turn the switch off “Cool”. Fact and mythology were woven together into a tapestry of our history and our hero and sheroes were to be treasured. In every tall tale there was a truth to be told about love, struggle, defiance, negritude, manhood, joy and Nommo. Na-mean?\n\nANYWAY…Signifyin Monkey, Shine, Wine and bad ass Stackolee, grew up in a place where I come from. In fact, they didn’t live too far from me. It was like a dream come true, and up the stairs I flew to meet Mr. MacDaddy… and do. I really wanted to work with Doug and Paul. Doug was directing the show and all, and they asked me what I wanted to do. I said “Ohhhh, I don’t know, gentlemen. I called em’ gentlemen…ya’ know? I said, “I can do a number of things but I just dropped in to see you. What would you like for me to do?“ They looked at each other, did a wise man chuckle and Doug asked me if I was familiar with “Shine”. I asked, “Are elephants heavy… Is water wet? I can do Shine, you bet”. I glanced at the script and went for what I knew, for it was all in the back of my head. There are about a hundred and thirty stanzas, depending on who’s tellin’ the tale…Or is it an hundred and thirty two? I did a few lines about the Captain and his jive daughter, I out swam the Shark, I even walked on water. I finished my bit and about ready to split, when they both walked over and shook my hand. Paul had a big smile as he slapped me on the back and said, “Nice, let me walk you out”. I turned and looked at Doug, he had a big grin on his mug. He said, “Now, that’s what I’m talkin’ about”. Now, Doug was also known for flippin’ a tale, or two, he’s an also an escape from down younder to. So, Paul is the Griot who spun the yarn, and wove the tale of the tapestry of Big MacDaddy …and Do.\n\nI’m sure Amos Tutuola would throw up his hands and holler if he could see and hear his tales from the bush adapted to contemporary theatre.\n\nThe Great MacDaddy is one of the most significant plays in the black canon today, but the world has yet to really experience its magic. It was one of the most significant and fulfilling events of my career and in my life. It was another opportunity to work with folks whom I admired, respected and learned a performance trick or two. The list includes Sir Graham Brown, Al Freeman, Jr., Adolph Caesar, Hattie, Winston, Cleavon Little, Charles Weldon, Roscoe Orman, Felicia Rashad, Marjorie Barnes, David Downing, Dyane Harvey, Bebe Drake Hooks, Alton Lathrop, Howard Porter, Alvin Ron Pratt, Freda Vanterpool, Victor Willis, Coleridge Tyler Perkinson, Dianne McIntyre, Douglass Turner Ward and Paul.\n\nThere was In the Wine Time and What The Wine-Sellers Buy, but the Great MacDaddy was the best Wine of all. It is a poetic compilation of our myth and history in this country and is a reflection of the social condition. It spans the test of time and can be adapted to every generation while remaining a literary mystery. With the evolution of our language, music, dance, lifestyles and constantly shifting social restrictions, the more things change, the more they stay the same. It is being revived to bring back a golden time forgotten tradition, and to inspire a new generation of storytellers…but most important of all… to bring back the times of Wine.\n\n“So, I saved the lady from the complete gentleman in the market who afterwards reduced to a “Skull” and the lady became my wife since that day. This is how I got a wife.” (Chapter 11,…\n\n“This old man was not really a man, he was a god and he was eating with his wife when I reached there . . . I myself was a god and juju-man.” (Chapter 1, p. 194)\n\nAmos Tutuola – from The Palm Wine Drinkard\n\n“… he is the greatest MacDaddy of all the MacDaddys, who can do anything in this world. PCH\n\nSati Jamal\n\n10/2012\n\nHonoring Doug Ward at the Black and Latino Playwrights Conference\n\n(Some diary notes)\n\n*The Interview Video with Doug Ward presented at the conference is featured at the bottom of this article.\n\nFor ten years now the Department of Theatre and Dance at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas has been presenting The Black and Latino Playwrights Conference under the Artistic Direction and leadership of its founder Eugene Lee. This conference which takes place in September selects one African and one Latino play from a host of works submitted to develop for a week and then present before an audience which will then provide feedback to the author about the possibilities for further development. Respected actors and experienced actors are brought in to work side by side with students in the department to rehearse and expedite this process. The mission of this conference is (in their own words) to: “Study the craft, nurture the artist and celebrate the work.” The conference has been highly successful and has grown over the years. Last year and this they had added an extra play to the program making it three plays they have presented instead of two. And now they have expanded it even further by adding a new component into the mix. A Distinguished Achievement Award for some important artist or pioneer in Black or Latino theatre. Douglas Turner Ward was selected to be the first recipient and I think it was an appropriate choice since for more than 30 years he was the Artistic Director and driving force for the Negro Ensemble Company (or: NEC) which was at one time the best known minority run theatre company in the US. The plays and playwrights it nurtured, developed and produced are well known, the artists it presented are, in some cases legendary, the crafts people it trained and put into the workplace are multiple. The last number verified is 4000. So yes, Doug Ward was an appropriate and deserving choice, and I was invited to participate.\n\nThursday 9-13-12\n\nI arrived and was picked by Eugene. It was pouring rain. Doug was supposed to arrive from New York around the same time but his plane was delayed at the Dallas- Fort Worth Airport due to the rain. He arrived a few hours later and we were taken to The Crystal House Bread & Breakfast an Inn located within walking distance of the university. There we met some of the guest artists participating in the conference. These included director Clinton Turner Davis, stage and film actress Elizabeth Pena, director Kinan Valdez, director Melissa Maxwell, actors Ruben C. Gonzalez, Manuel Zarate and the three playwrights. All had been here since Sunday working on the plays, preparing them for presentation.\n\nFriday 9-14-12\n\nAt 11AM we attended the Department’s Chair John Fleming’s Theatre Orientation class of about 75 or so students. We were in their small theatre where we sat on the stage and introduced ourselves and briefly told what we had done in the theatre. It started out somewhat slowly and politely, as can sometimes be the case when strangers meet strangers. And things proceeded in this dull fashion until somewhere in the middle of things a student asked Doug a question and he became the Doug Ward I know. Articulate, energetic and passionately engaged. And being Doug his speech was amusingly peppered with profanities that he used to emphasize certain points he was trying to make. The students suddenly came alive and started asking all sorts of questions not only to Doug but to the rest of us as well. But it was Doug, articulate, knowledgeable and passionate, who was charging the air with electricity and sparks. So what began as a quietly dull affair became an extraordinarily lively event that ended with a standing ovation from the students and then continued outside afterwards with students who didn’t have to rush off to another class. And as I stood there and listened them breathlessly asking Doug one question after another I said to myself: “Now they know who he is and why Eugene chose him for this honor.”\n\nIn the main theatre that night at 7:30PM Eugene Lee introduced Doug to an audience that included the University’s President Dr. Denise Trauth and her husband. He said a few words this was followed by a scene from his breakthrough play Day of Absence after which he sat on the stage and talked about how he came about writing it and how its success eventually led to the creation of The NEC.\n\nA scene from Samm-Art Williams’ Home followed and after Doug talked about directing the play and taking it to Broadway.\n\nThen a scene from Charles Fuller’s Pulitzer Prize winning A Soldier’s Play, which featured the Conference’s Founder and Artistic Director Eugene Lee as a member of the original cast was presented. Again Doug took the stage and spoke about the play and the cast that included Denzel Washington, Samuel Jackson, David Allan Grier, Adolph Cesar and several others. “We toured that play and played in so many cities that just about every black male actor who fitted the age of the characters got a chance to play it. We were like a little cottage industry keeping a certain percent of the acting population employed.” This was followed by a Q&A from the audience at which Doug was once again Powerful and passionate and thoroughly engaging. Eugene presented him with The Distinguished Achievement Award. This was greeted with another standing ovation. Two in one day I thought was quite impressive.\n\nSaturday turned out to be our busiest day. It started at 10:30 AM with a very informative presentation on The History of Black Theatre in Texas given by Dr. Sandra Mayo and Dr. Elvin Holt who have written and edited two books on the subject. We then took a lunch break after which was my turn. I had been invited to present a history of the Negro Ensemble Company. My time slot was 1:15 to 2:30PM. What I elected to do rather than fill the time up with talk was to present two video interviews of Doug giving his first hand account on the forming of the NEC and its struggles as well as its triumphs. The first video tentatively titled The History of the NEC had been filmed 15 years ago. It shows a robust Doug talking about and reminiscing about various aspects of the NEC and his tenure as its Artistic Director. The second entitled The Lion at Rest (Part one) was filmed specifically for this conference last June when I was in New York. Here you see Doug after the operation, his speech somewhat compromised but nevertheless clear and his answers somewhat more philosophical. I call them “Doug then” and Doug now”. Together I felt that they would give a fairly clear representation of the man and his theatre company and they did, if I’m to judge from the feedback I got afterwards.\n\nAt 3PM we attended the first reading. A play by Radha Blank entitled Casket Sharp, directed by Clinton Turner Davis. I found the play lively and interesting especially in its linguistic aspect represented by the dialogue given by the members of a street gang. It reminded me of the newspeak in George Orwell’s 1984 and the invented slang nadsat in Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange… A Q&A with the audience followed hen it was dinner break time.\n\nAt 7:30 we attended the next reading Seven Sisters by Bridgette A. Wimberly, directed by Melissa Maxwell. I was engaged by the authorial voice and structure of this play. And as usual the acting in both plays, although they were just readings, I found to be excellent by both guest artists and the students. The presentations ended around 10:30PM after which we were all invited by Eugene and his wife Pinky to a party at their house where a delicious barbeque and fried catfish was served. I sat in the music room with Joe Luis Cedillo, Eugene’s Associate Artistic Director and a very good playwright as well. Doug held court as we all listened attentively. I was particularly taken by a story he told about hiring Miles Davis for a dance in Harlem during the late 1940s or early 50s. Every time I think I’ve heard everything he has to say I find out there’s always something more. It’s like going into a house and opening one door only to find out that it leads to another and another and another ad infinitum… Somewhere after midnight I started to fade out Doug was feeling the same way. So we left. Joe Luis drove us back to the end and that was the end of a long but fulfilling day.\n\nFter brunch on Sunday at noon we watched the third reading. This was the Latino play Tango Through the Revolution by Adam Esquenazi Douglas directed by Kinan Valdezwhich tells the story of the Cuban Revolution and its impact on one family. The play was based on he experience of the author’s uncle who happened to be in the audience for the reading. This was revealed to us during the Q&A that followed. It provided us with an emotionally moving moment that was greeted by a standing ovation.\n\nAll the time it was raining outside. In fact it rained off and on for the entire weekend. But that was fine with me. We get so little rain where I live in Arizona that any sight of it is welcomed. Several vehicles took us to Eugene’s house once again just to chill out and hang. Several of the Latino guest members along with myself were leaving that night around seven. So we brought our suitcases and left them in the car. At the appropriate time Joe Luis took us to the airport where we said goodbye and left on our various flights.\n\nAll in all I found it to be a lively and informative weekend filled with a myriad of unexpected delights starting with the courtesies Chairman John Fleming and his Department’s faculty and students lavished on us. And extending to meeting up with old friends and making new ones. The students were particularly stimulating just by their energy and all the questions they asked.\n\nI think that this conference serves an important function in the area and I hope that it continues to be supported and grow even faster than it has. This year was its 10th Anniversary. A toast to its existence."
