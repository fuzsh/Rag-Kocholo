        "text": "I first visited northern New Mexico 13 years ago on a road trip. I had dreamed of this landscape, climate, culture, and color palette since first being exposed to Native American history and nature photography of the Southwest as a child. I wanted to return but lived internationally, so it wasn’t until 2017 that I began to frequent the area again. At that time, I lived in the Yucatan and would come here to escape the dense, sweltering, rainy season (or the “buggy, sticky, itchy season” as I experienced it) and stay in an off-grid area in Taos County. Even without running water or electricity, or perhaps because of this, I was smitten. Why am I not living here, I thought. Soon after, I moved to the “Land of Enchantment”—or entrapment. (Or, most likely, a bit of both.)\n\nOver the past few years, I began noticing that so much of the New Mexico-centric travel coverage I was coming across felt a little repetitive: geared towards the constant influx of tourists usually flying in and out of Albuquerque, staying in Santa Fe, then speedily heading up to Taos or Abiquiu for a quick day trip. So I set out to explore further, with a particular focus on small businesses, solopreneurs, artisans, and other special offerings, with the hope of sharing and celebrating those places and ventures that make New Mexico such a desirable and unique tapestry of high, low, old and new.\n\nWelcome to my totally subjective and not at all exhaustive suggested itinerary of where to eat, stay, shop, and play in New Mexico. It’s focused on the north-south axis along the Rio Grande, between Truth or Consequences and Taos County. Five days is the suggested duration, though it could easily be extended to a week or more; or even broken down into smaller jaunts, focusing on each town and the clusters of sights and surrounding areas. The choice is yours.\n\nTruth or Consequences\n\nInitially known as Hot Springs, New Mexico, this small town of around 6,000 people about 150 miles south of Albuquerque changed names in 1950, as a result of winning a radio show competition. Situated on the Rio Grande—and as the original name would indicate—the area is known for its natural hot springs and public baths. T or C, as it’s most commonly known today, is a quirky place. Signs around town read “hot springs, cool town,” and local folk are wont to share that “if you’re here, you’re not all there.” It makes for a particularly good spot to start or end a New Mexico road trip, as, quite simply, there is just not much to do but soak, relax, repeat.\n\nDining options are limited in and around T or C, so it’s best to be prepared. Definitely bring some snacks, and consider a stay at Sierra Grande where overnight guests benefit from an expanded continental breakfast that includes oats, bacon, eggs, green chile from nearby Hatch, NM, and more. Mile Marker 7 is an adorable drive-thru roadside café serving tasty coffee and tea concoctions, breakfast sandwiches, salads, and baked goods like jalapeno bagels and donuts. At La Baracca, chef Michael Demeo serves high-quality, inventive Mediter-Asian that is available on-site, as well as for pick up or delivery. La Baracca, Grapevine Bistro, and other local restaurants are also accustomed to delivering to the Truth or Consequences Brewing Co., an excellent meeting point on North Broadway where locals and visitors convene over in-house brews and eclectic programming that includes karaoke, trivia, open mic, and live music. The Brewing Co. also has a sister property, Sidekixx Bar & Kitchen, that doubles as a pizzeria and bowling alley; as well as a downtown bodega selling New Mexico-made spirits, snacks, and sundries.\n\nOn my most recent trip, in addition to Sierra Grande, I visited two other Ted Turner Reserves properties: namely Armendaris, situated on 360,000 acres of semi-desert, and Ladder, a natural oasis on over 156,000 acres. I had never before witnessed a conservation effort of this magnitude. Not only are there unspoiled landscapes, rich biodiversity, and preserved cultural heritage, each property offers private tours, flexible itineraries, highly knowledgeable guides, and the option to book accommodations at either the “Hacienda” or “Country House,” providing guests with a stay that is fully experiential.\n\nAlbuquerque\n\nWith a population currently clocking in at over half a million, “Burque” is New Mexico’s largest town. And while it definitely delivers a dose of city energy, there is also a fascinating rural feel due to the Rio Grande flowing north to south, a continued agricultural presence in certain neighborhoods, and the fact it’s flanked by both the Sandia Mountains to the east and the West Mesa to the west.\n\nDefinitely don’t miss Alchemy Studio to see work by high-frequency fiber artist Cheryl Ruth, functional pottery by Patty Bilbro, and gallery owner Lucy Barna’s brand Votive Designs. Continuing north 3.5 miles to Cerrillos, wander the dirt streets and take a peek at the architecture in the Historic District, poke around at the Casa Grande Trading Post, Mining Museum & Petting Zoo, or explore the Cerrillos State Park trails a bit further up.\n\nSanta Fe\n\nSettled by the conquistador Don Pedro de Peralta in the first decade of the 17th century and sitting at over 7,000 feet in elevation, Santa Fe is the oldest and highest capital city in the United States. Though the population is well under 100,000, the so-called “City Different” has an impressive selection of indie shops, cool galleries, and top-notch museums, as well as walkable neighborhoods, and excellent epicurean offerings for all budgets and palates. All of that with a dose of easily accessible escapism, due to being geographically located in a valley of the Rio Grande and surrounded by over a million acres of national forest. I have also begun to feel a much-needed shift lately in terms of the demographic, especially in regard to entertainment and queer-led initiatives.\n\nIn the unassuming Solana Shopping Center on West Alameda, Betterday Vintage proposes a well-merchandised selection of clothing and accessories for adults and children, as well as vinyl records for dedicated crate diggers. Next door, La Montañita Co-op offers an indie alternative to bigger-name grocers. From there, head over to Second Street Brewery’s Rufina Taproom or nearby Tumbleroot Brewery and Distillery for primo libations, live music, DJs, crawfish boils, and more. Neighboring art collective Meow Wolf continues to crowd-please with both their permanent, immersive exhibition The House of Eternal Return, and music by artists that run the gamut from Dirtwire to Trevor Hall to Jasmine Infiniti.\n\nSanta Fe, of course, has innumerable praise-worthy dining options, many frequented to the point that both locals and visitors alike have a hard time getting a table (hello Paloma and Paper Dosa!). One delectable crowd-pleaser is Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen. Now in its 11th year, this low-key and constantly buzzing spot serves breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and (delicious) desserts seven days a week in a spacious, barn-like converted gallery just west of Saint Francis Drive. The globally-inspired menu is eclectic, totally gluten-free, and accessible to almost any palate due to vegetarian, vegan, and paleo options. Think: matcha green smoothie bowls, breakfast burritos, umami bowls, NM bison burgers, yucca root flatbread pizzas, salmon tacos, carrot cake, and chocolate avocado mousse. All of the consciously-sourced ingredients are fresh and natural, and the drink menu offers sustainable, organic, biodynamic wines and sake, as well as a selection of regional and imported beers, smoothies, agua frescas, adaptogenic beverages, and other non-alcoholic options.\n\nHeading north, skip the highway and take the back roads up to Tesuque. Stop in at Bishop’s Lodge, an Auberge property, for shishito peppers, Baja tacos, and a glass of wine recommended by sommelière Missy Auge at the refined yet comfy SkyFire bar. There is often live music and the patio seating offers a photo-friendly viewpoint, particularly at sundown. Bishop’s Lodge also has elevated programming that is open to the public, from collaborations with guest chefs and artists, and heart-centered holistic wellness experiences, like Alchemy of Breath and Sound, facilitated by yours truly.\n\nAlso in the area is Tesuque Village Market. Loved by locals, it’s open daily for quesadillas, green chile chicken posole, baked goods, some of the best pizza around, as well as provisions and cute merch.\n\nHigh Road to Taos\n\nAs if 7,000 feet in altitude weren’t enough, I absolutely recommend taking the High Road to (or from) Taos. Not only does this scenic byway guarantee unparalleled views of the badlands—Sangre de Cristo mountains to the east and the Jemez to the west—there are some special spots to stop at along the way. After Tesuque, stop at the Nambé Trading Post and Museum of Western Film and Costume, run by Emmy award-winning costume designer Cathy Smith and her daughter, jewelry designer Jennifer Jesse Smith. The selection of home goods, art, books, rugs, and blankets is truly exceptional, as are the costumes and props on display from Smith’s illustrious career.\n\nContinue your journey with a pit stop in picturesque Peñasco to visit the newly opened MAH Creative featuring work by artist owner Mary Arose, painters Hannah Heaton and Nancy Davis, printmaker Nick Beason, and upcycled Karmahigh Creations by Dyanna Beckwith. Arose and her husband David Hines converted the downstairs floor of the space into what is now the Peñasco Art Lodge, a two-bedroom, pet-friendly space that accommodates up to six people. Then visit Sugar Nymphs Bistro, a lively spot established in 2001, serving as a sort of de facto community center for the Peñasco area. Staples include the pulled pork sandwich, green chile cheeseburger, and the carrot cake; however, lighter fare like soups and salads are available as well.\n\nTaos\n\nThis groovy mountain town that I am thrilled to call home is small but mighty, easy to navigate, and worth a closer look than many visitors realize when coming for the first time. A town with a scope far beyond its scale, Taos is first and foremost home to the Taos Pueblo, the heart of these sacred Tiwa lands; continuously inhabited for over 1,000 years, and a World Heritage site. There’s the international devotional destination, the Taos Hanuman Temple, situated on over 10 acres of the impeccably maintained grounds of the Sri Neem Karoli Baba Ashram right near the center of town. There’s a world-class ski resort—and some other popular ones, too, like locals-friendly Sipapu. There’s spectacular hiking, legendary views, cold rivers, and hot springs. Additionally, Taos has a vibrant spectrum of local businesses, ranging from food and beverage outlets to art, wellness, music, community initiatives, and shopping.\n\nBefore hitting the road to head out of town, ensure you have some provisions for the journey ahead. At 6,969 feet already, if you’re down to get a little higher, head to Taos Canyon Cannabis, where all of the premium genetics are grown organically, and most often within Taos County. The staff is super knowledgeable, and I appreciate how patient they are with a relative newbie like me.\n\nNow, then, for food supplies. If you happen to be in town on a Saturday, stop at the Taos Farmers Market, which took up residency in the County Courthouse parking lot this season, and has a nice variety of vendors serving prepared foods like tamales, omelets, baked goods, and more. Or go to the Farmhouse Café and Bakery, located on an idyllic piece of land in the foothills of the Pueblo (which is open to visitors, by the way, and also has a little weekly farmer’s market). The food is all fresh, organic, and sourced from over 20 local farms and ranches. Farmhouse founder Micah Roseberry has been an organic farmer and educator for over 25 years, and through her organization Growing Community Now, she provides gardening and nutritional education to Taos pre-K to high school students and serves 700+ local, organic meals daily to local youth. One last daytime food recommendation would be the Golden Piñon, headed up by chef Jaime Saenz Ramirez and serving a broad selection of hearty and flavor-filled Mexican, New Mexican, and American classics.\n\nBy day, in addition to the obligatory Ghost Ranch-O’Keeffe Home and Studio doubleheader, venture a bit further afield. My last jaunt was full of firsts for me: I set out to hike the dry riverbed of Plaza Blanca, marveling at the massive rock towers composed of volcanic debris and somewhere around 18 to 27 million years old. (Access is limited and must be arranged in advance via the Dar Al Islam mosque and education center.) Then, through the introduction of a friend, I stopped in to chat with jeweler Tamara Kay at her shop, Nest, a hybrid shop/showroom that celebrates creativity, culture, and community. From there, I set out to visit the home studio of Hebé García, who also happened to be one of the artists whose work was on display at the shop. Garcia and her husband, both originally from Puerto Rico, live on a seemingly endless mesa above Abiquiu, with expansive views from the Pedernal to Taos Mountain and on up to Colorado. García specializes in figurative painting and ceramic sculpture, with narratives that weave mythology, feminism, poetry, culture, and history in a way that is both gentle and strong; deep, without being heavy."
