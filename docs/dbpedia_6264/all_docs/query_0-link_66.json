        "text": "For other uses, see Socorro (disambiguation).\n\nCity in New Mexico, United States\n\nSocorro ( , sə-KOR-oh) is a city in Socorro County in the U.S. state of New Mexico. It is in the Rio Grande Valley at an elevation of 4,579 feet (1,396 m). In 2010 the population was 9,051. It is the county seat of Socorro County.[5] Socorro is located 74 miles (119 km) south of Albuquerque and 146 miles (235 km) north of Las Cruces.\n\nThe instruments used by the LINEAR program are located at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site (ETS) on the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) near Socorro, New Mexico.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1598, Juan de Oñate led a group of Spanish settlers through the Jornada del Muerto, an inhospitable patch of desert that ends just south of the present-day city of Socorro. As the Spaniards emerged from the desert, Piro Indians of the pueblo of Teypana gave them food and water. Therefore, the Spaniards renamed this pueblo Socorro, which means \"help\" or \"aid\". Later, the name \"Socorro\" would be applied to the nearby Piro pueblo of Pilabó.[6]\n\nNuestra Señora de Perpetuo Socorro, the first Catholic mission in the area, was probably established c. 1626. Fray Agustín de Vetancurt would later write that around 600 people lived in the area during this period.[7] Mines in the Socorro mountains were opened by 1626.[8]\n\nDuring the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Spanish refugees stopped in the pueblo of Socorro. A number of Piro Indians followed the Spaniards as they left the province to go south to safety. With no protection of Spanish troops, Socorro was destroyed and the remaining Piro were killed by the Apache and other tribes.[9]\n\nThe Spanish did not initially resettle Socorro when they re-conquered New Mexico. Other than El Paso, there were no Spanish settlements south of Sabinal (which is approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Socorro) until the 1800s.[10] In 1800, governor Fernando Chacon gave the order to resettle Socorro and other villages in the area. However, Socorro was not resettled until about 1815.[11] In 1817, 70 Belen residents petitioned the crown for land in Socorro.[12] The 1833 Socorro census lists over 400 residents, with a total of 1,774 people living within the vicinity of the village.[13]\n\nThe mission of San Miguel de Socorro was established soon after Socorro was resettled. The church was built on the ruins of the old Nuestra Señora de Socorro.[14]\n\nTerritorial period\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 1846, during the Mexican–American War, New Mexico was occupied by the American Army. In Las Vegas, New Mexico, Colonel Stephen W. Kearny proclaimed New Mexico's independence from Mexico. On their way to begin their assault on Mexico, American troops stopped in Socorro. A British officer, Lt. George Ruxton, commented that these soldiers were \"unwashed and unshaven, were ragged and dirty, without uniforms...\" and were lacking in discipline.[15]\n\nIn September 1850, New Mexico became a territory of the United States. At the time, New Mexico encompassed what is now the states of New Mexico and Arizona. In 1850, the population of Socorro was only 543 people. This included 100 American soldiers who were soon moved to Valverde.[16]\n\nThe first military post built near Socorro was Fort Conrad, 30 miles (48 km) south of the town. Built in August 1851, the fort was badly constructed and was abandoned for Fort Craig, located a few miles away. Fort Craig was first occupied on March 31, 1854.[17][18]\n\nThe New Mexico and Southern Pacific Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) arrived in July 1880, as it built south through the Rio Grande valley on its way toward El Paso. Its presence contributed to growth of the community, as it also became a center of mining activity of lead and zinc.[19]\n\nThe New Mexico School of Mines (now the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology) was founded in Socorro in 1889.\n\nOn April 24, 1964, Lonnie Zamora, a local policeman, claimed to have observed a flying saucer and two little beings. Zamora's claim is known as the Lonnie Zamora incident.\n\nGeography and geology\n\n[edit]\n\nSocorro is located 75 miles (121 km) south of Albuquerque, at an average elevation of 4,605 feet (1,404 m). The town lies adjacent to the Rio Grande in a landscape dominated by the Rio Grande rift and numerous extinct volcanoes. The immediate region encompasses approximately 6,000 feet (1,800 m) of vertical relief between the Rio Grande and the Magdalena Mountains. Notable nearby locales include the Cibola National Forest, the Bureau of Land Management Quebradas Scenic Backcountry Byway, and the Bosque del Apache and Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuges. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.4 square miles (37 km2), of which 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2), or 0.21%, is water.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSocorro has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk). Summers are hot, reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average of 82 days annually. Winters are mild, but nights are cold with 126 days falling to or below freezing per year. The record high temperature of 109 °F (43 °C) was recorded on June 26, 1994, while the record low of −16 °F (−27 °C) was recorded on December 21, 1909.\n\nSocorro averages 10.05 inches (255 mm) of annual precipitation, with a peak of 2.43 inches (62 mm) in July.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18801,272—18902,29580.4%19001,512−34.1%19101,5603.2%19201,256−19.5%19302,05863.9%19403,71280.4%19504,33416.8%19605,27121.6%19705,84911.0%19807,17322.6%19908,15913.7%20008,8778.8%20109,0512.0%20208,707−3.8%\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 8,877 people, 3,415 households, and 2,151 families residing in the city.[23] The population density was 615.8 inhabitants per square mile (237.8/km2).

The golf shoot begins by teeing off from Socorro Peak, also known as M Mountain, at an altitude of 7,243 feet (2,208 m), golfers proceed down the side of the mountain some 2,550 vertical feet to the one hole almost three miles (5 km) away.\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Miguel de Socorro – San Miguel Mission\n\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array\n\nBosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge\n\nSevilleta National Wildlife Refuge\n\nTrinity (nuclear test) site, White Sands Missile Range\n\nOwl Bar and Cafe\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSocorro Consolidated School District has approx. 2,000 students and 285 staff.[25] Socorro has one public high school, Socorro High School.\n\nThe town is the location of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, which is a state-funded research- and teaching-oriented university. New Mexico Tech has approximately 1,500 undergraduate students, 500 graduate students, and 150 academic staff.\n\nCurrently, the Summer Science Program in Astrophysics is hosted at New Mexico Tech.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nHighways\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate 25, north–south travel: north through Albuquerque and south to Las Cruces which is the terminus for I-25 where it intersects I-10.\n\nU.S. Route 60, east–west travel: east through Clovis; west through Magdalena to Arizona.\n\nNM 1\n\nNM 439\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nFreight service is provided by a BNSF line from Belen, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas. Passenger service ceased in 1968, when ATSF (BNSF’s predecessor) cancelled its El Pasoan train.\n\nAirport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Socorro airport, located on the southern edge of the city, received scheduled airline service by Continental Airlines in the early 1950s. A Douglas DC-3 aircraft provided a daily northbound flight to Albuquerque (that went on to Denver after several stops) and a southbound flight to El Paso with stops at Truth or Consequences and Las Cruces. Zia Airlines, a small commuter airline, also made on-demand flag stops at the Socorro airport on their flights between Albuquerque and Las Cruces in the mid 1970s.[26] The airport remains in use as a general aviation facility with several based aircraft.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nActress Jodie Foster stayed in Socorro while filming the movie Contact (1997) at the Very Large Array fifty miles west of the city. Based on the map that was faxed to Jodie Foster's character (Dr. Eleanor Arroway) in the film, the Socorro airport was also the location of meeting between Dr. Arroway and S.R. Hadden.[27]\n\n12 Strong (2018) had several scenes recorded in Socorro, NM due to how similar the terrain was to Afghanistan. Filming specifically took place on M Mountain for several days, among the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center's bomb range. 50 extras from Socorro and surrounding areas were used in several scenes in the film. Originally titled \"Horse Soldiers\", filming also took place in White Sands National Monument, and Fort Bliss. During this time, production crew and actors were seen in Socorro as they mostly stayed in local hotels, and ate out at local restaurants. Chris Hemsworth was spotted at the Socorro Springs restaurant and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology's gym.[28]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nElfego Baca (1865–1945), lawman, lawyer, and politician[29]\n\nJeff Bhasker, record producer and musician\n\nHolm O.
