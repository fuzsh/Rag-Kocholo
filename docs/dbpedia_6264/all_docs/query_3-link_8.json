        "text": "Douglas graduated from the University of Mississippi in 2002 with a degree in education. She spent several years teaching in Houston, TX, Memphis, TN, and Charlotte NC before settling down here in Arkansas with her husband, Alan Turner, a Little Rock native. After teaching for over a decade, Douglas knew it was time to finally begin her career in Real Estate and she joined The Janet Jones Company. Douglas is committed to providing excellent service to her clients and she understands that real estate is not just about properties; it is about people and their needs. She recently received the Diamond Award from the Little Rock Realtors Association. Douglas lives in Cammack Village, where she serves on the building standards committee. She enjoys volunteering with the 20th Century Club, her children’s schools, and Arkansas Food Bank. She also currently serves as a board member of Service Over Self. For fun, Douglas enjoys traveling and spending time with family and friends."
