        "text": "Doug Turner\n\nPartner\n\nDoug began his journey serving the local church as a pastor in Texas and Georgia where his passion for helping churches resource their visions through generosity emerged. As the senior pastor of Peachtree Corners Baptist Church, he led his church through two successful capital campaigns and witnessed the transformational nature of stewardship. Since that time, Doug has helped churches experience God when many least expect it: during a capital campaign.\n\nDoug believes generosity occurs only when there is a deep shift in church culture that drives dramatic, profound change in the hearts and minds of individuals. Because the culture of each church is unique, Doug encourages a fresh and creative campaign design based on the spiritual disciplines of prayer and discernment of God’s will for each person. Throughout the campaign, individuals wrestle with the biblical principles of generosity and the result…grace-filled giving.\n\nDoug has been a guide, coach, and confidante to dozens of church pastors including Bill Hybels (Willow Creek Community Church), Tim Keller (Redeemer Presbyterian Church), John Ortberg (Menlo Park Presbyterian Church), and many others. His engaging confidence and diversity of experience allow Doug to equip and empower church staff, leaders, and volunteers to successfully drive an innovative process for fully funding the church’s vision.\n\nIn his experience, Doug has led campaigns totaling over $1billion committed to the organizations served. He lives in Eatonton, Georgia with his wife, Jill. They have four children and two granddaughters. Most Sundays, he preaches at the Grove Chapel and occasionally enjoys golf (well, “enjoy” is such a strong word for a maniacal game)."
