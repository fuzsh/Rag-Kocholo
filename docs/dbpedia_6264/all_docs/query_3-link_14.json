        "text": "Doug began his professional career as an engineer after earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati in 1994. After five years in the industry, he elected to transition into the real estate business as a full-time professional Realtor where he could combine his mechanical background and attention to detail to serve his clients. A top producing agent since 2000, Doug earned the title of Sales Vice President in 2016 after just one year with the prestigious real estate brokerage of Robinson Sotheby's International Realty. Adding to his recent accolades, Doug has received the honor of being awarded the Cincinnati Area Board of Realtors Circle of Excellence Award for 2016-2022. In addition to his professional achievements, Doug is actively involved in the community sponsoring and assisting with coaching his daughterâ€™s soccer team, being an active member of the Greyhound Adoption of Greater Cincinnati and the National Borzoi Rescue Foundation and serving on the board of his local triathlon club, the Mojo Tri-Club based in West Chester, OH. Among his noteworthy personal accomplishments, Doug is a two-time Ironman triathlete, completing Ironman Louisville in 2016 and Ironman Indiana in 2021. As a lifelong Cincinnati resident, Dougâ€™s knowledge of the local market and real estate process serves to provide his clients a thorough and well-rounded experience whether they are looking to buy their first home, move up to a larger home, relocate to the area, or sell a property. If you would like to take advantage of his 23+ years of experience in the real estate industry, Doug would love the opportunity to speak with you."
