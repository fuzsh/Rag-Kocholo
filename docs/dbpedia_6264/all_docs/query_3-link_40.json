        "text": "Obituary of Rev. Douglas R. Turner\n\nRev. Douglas R. Turner, DRE\n\nFebruary 12, 1948 – July 9, 2023\n\nRev. Douglas R. Turner, of Wedowee, AL, age 75, passed from this life on Saturday, July 9, 2023, after an extended illness. He was born in the Spring Bank community near Chatom, AL on February 12, 1948. He pastored several Baptist churches across Alabama during his 50 plus years in the ministry.\n\nBro. Doug is survived by his loving wife, Shelia, a resident of Wedowee, a son, Dr. Brandon Turner (Ashley) of Hoover, AL, a son, Chuck Chappell (Tabitha) of Wedowee and a son, Chantlee Chappell (Ashley) of Roanoke, AL. Also, grandchildren of Bro. Doug are Carter Turner, Deacon Turner, Skyler Chappell, Karlee Smith (Roy), Hunter Henry, Sage Chappell, Sara Grace Chappell, Aspen Chappell, Chloe Chappell, and Avee Chappell. His one surviving sibling is Larry V. Turner (Susan) of Chatom as well as numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nPreceding Bro. Doug in death was his first wife of 30 years, Verna Taylor Turner. Also, preceding him were his parents, William Bruce Turner and Lillie Carpenter Turner, and his siblings, Keith, Wayne, Barney, and Wilson Turner, all of Chatom.\n\nBro. Doug graduated from Washington County High in Chatom in 1966 where he was Salutatorian of his class. Professional degrees earned were: 1970 B. S. Degree in Religious Education from William Carey College in Hattiesburg, MS (cum laude), 1974 Masters Degree in Religious Education from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (summa cum laude), and 1980 Doctorate Degree in Religious Education from the International Bible Seminary in Orlando, FL (summa cum laude).\n\nOn July 19, 1964, at 16 years of age, Bro. Doug was licensed to the ministry by his home church, Spring Bank Baptist of Chatom. He then pastored/ministered in these eight Alabama churches over the next 50 years: 1966-70 Yellow Pine Baptist, 1970-72 Fruitdale Baptist, 1975-78 First Baptist of Troy (Associate Pastor), 1978-82 Eastern Hills Baptist, 1982-89 First Baptist of Guin, 1989-2003 First Baptist of Roanoke, 2003-13 Sweetwater Baptist, and 2014-17 Black Creek Baptist.\n\nBro. Doug had a variety of special interests and hobbies. He enjoyed golf, football (played guard on the 1964 WCHS State Championship team), collecting knives, walking sticks, and Western memorabilia of all kinds, especially Western shows and movies. He was an avid reader.\n\nAs a pastor, Bro. Doug was beloved by his congregations. Several churches chose him as their pastor with a 100% vote. He was always impeccably prepared to preach and teach on every occasion; his sermons were exceptionally inspiring with topics still remembered by many today. Not only did Bro. Doug love to preach and teach, he loved to study God’s Word and did so right up to days before his death—he was a true Bible scholar. He explained the gospel to countless youngsters with his children’s sermons and the object lessons and figurines he used in these presentations.\n\nBro. Doug served several years on the Alabama State Board of Missions, the governing agency for Alabama Baptists. He possessed a great love for the work of the Alabama Baptist Children’s Homes. As a tribute, his family is asking that in lieu of flowers, please make a donation in memory of Bro. Doug to the ABCH at 2681 Rocky Ridge Lane, Birmingham, AL 35216 or donorservices@alabamachild.org\n\nTo honor Bro. Doug’s life and ministry, a Visitation will be held on Friday, July 14, 2023, from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Benefield Funeral Home in Wedowee. Also, a funeral service will be held here the next day, Saturday, July 15, 2023 at 11 a.m. On Saturday, July 29, 2023, at 2 p.m., a Memorial Service will be held at the Spring Bank Baptist Church in Chatom."
