        "text": "independent writer and curator\n\nIn 2010, Douglas Turner began writing art journalism, beginning with his culture blog, “The Architecture of Tomorrow”. His art writing has appeared in numerous independent print and digital publications. His essays can be found in collections, and in the form of book introductions, as well as catalog essays. In 2014 he launched AOT Project Salon and began curating salon-style exhibitions in his home in Brooklyn, New York, until 2019. Douglas is Resident Curator with Standard Space, a contemporary gallery in Sharon, CT, exhibiting contemporary works by emerging and mid-career artists working across diverse media. His most recent project is the creation of the Black Femme Residency in 2021. The residency is hosted by Wassaic Project in Dutchess County.\n\nIn 2015, AOTProject manifested MOart—a mobile and satellite art education and advocacy program. Founded on the principles of equal education, artists are given the opportunity to bring their privilege to work in underserved communities. The program provides a supportive environment for children to engage with advanced concepts of art, as a means to nurture their own creative inclinations or inhibitions. The program is designed to build confidence in decision-making, nurture imagination, and trust in the creative process. For his work, he was given the Brownsville Changemaker Award, by the local NYCHA Community in East New York. Douglas also serves on the art advisory board for the Lower East Side Girls Club.\n\nIn January of 2020, he launched Wedge Studio a curated platform for small works and prints, artists and collectors. The Wedge Studio catalog presents works from established and developing artists from across the country.\n\nMost recently, he announced the creation of Douglas Turner Projects Residencies, a suite of residencies with a priority to serve marginalized communities. Black Femme Residencies is the launch residency taking place in upstate New York and Connecticut, partnering with Wassaic Project, Center for Performance Research, Warner Theatre, and support from and an exhibition with Standard Space contemporary gallery in Sharon, CT. The BFR inaugural artists are Ayana Evans and Tsedaye Makonnen. With an intersectional agenda, these residencies will be made possible by the collaboration of various organizational resources and by the support of individuals."
