        "text": "Randal Douglas Turner, 74, passed away on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, in Newport News, VA. He was a native of Pulaski, Virginia, and had lived in Newport News for the past 50 years. Doug was a private in the Army before becoming an insurance agent, where he stayed for over 30 years.\n\nHis parents, Randal Benjamin Turner (Linda) and Lula Jewel Munford (Howard), preceded him in death.\n\nDoug is survived by his loving wife of 34 years, Donna Turner; two daughters, Christi Eastep (Jeff) and Michelle Coston (Von); four grandchildren, Gage Callahan, Reise Carter, Kobe Coston, and Khloe Coston; brother Jerry Turner (Jeannie); and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe had a passion for baseball. In July 1969, Doug was recruited to try out for the Pittsburg Pirates and the Houston Astros, but he was drafted into the military. Doug became known as Coach Turner to many, from T-Ball to teens to the development of All-Star Teams. In addition to baseball, he loved sports. He always took advantage of an opportunity to watch a football game. Doug had a passion for fishing and loved the solitude of wetting a line, even if he caught nothing.\n\nAnyone who knew him could always expect a joke. He loved to twist any situation to make you laugh.\n\nHis yard was his masterpiece. He was meticulous about every blade of grass, climbing ladders to prune trees even if he fell out of them a few times. He would climb back up and repeat the process.\n\nEvery job was manageable for him. Doug had every tool you could ever need or imagine. He loved working on projects around the house, most of the time catching him outside. Doug was “Mr. Fix-It,” not only to his family but to a multitude of neighbors and friends as well.\n\nVisitation will occur at Peninsula Funeral Home on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m. A graveside service will be held at Peninsula Memorial Park on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, at 3:00 p.m."
