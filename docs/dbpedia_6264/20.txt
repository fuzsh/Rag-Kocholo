Leigh N (Turner) Porter of San Diego passed away on January 5th. Leigh was born on May 16th, 1974, to Doug Turner and Cynthia Walker in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Leigh was not unlike the hummingbirds and bees that she loved so much, small but mighty. Leigh was a friend like no other. She took great pleasure in giving to everyone around her, whether it was cooking dinner for 12 or picking up the tab before â€¦
