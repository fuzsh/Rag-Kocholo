Leigh N (Turner) Porter of San Diego passed away on January 5th. Leigh was born on May 16th, 1974, to Doug Turner and Cynthia Walker in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Leigh was not unlike the hummingbirds and bees that she loved so much, small but mighty. Leigh was a friend like no other. She took great pleasure in giving to everyone around her, whether it was cooking dinner for 12 or picking up the tab before anyone else had the opportunity to do so. She loved to share her Padres tickets and often filled her boat with friends. She was a generous and kind and never missed the chance to help someone.

Leigh loved dogs and kids. She was Auntie Leigh to many, but no one can dispute that her favorite was her niece, Olivia. Leigh loved to tell “Olivia stories.” She was constantly amazed by her and so proud to be her aunt.

Leigh was an amazing businesswoman. She built a financial business that she took great pride in. Her success afforded her the ability to give to everyone in her life and she did!

Leigh is survived by her mother Cynthia Nix Walker (Mike), father Doug Turner (Peggy), her sister Alex Turner (Jeff Tunnell), her niece Olivia, half sister Rhonda Reyna, along with many aunts and uncles, cousins and step siblings.

Be generous. Be kind. Be a good friend.
