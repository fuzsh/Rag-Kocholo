About Douglas Turner

Although I am an artist in my own right, for now I am offering the works of Leona Turner, who was my mother. I am offering these images on the tenth anniversary of her death. She was an artist all of her life, equally adept at portraits and landscapes and still-life. Oils pastels or watercolors, she was masterful at each. She was also a teacher that many artists owe a great deal to. She lived and worked in Albuquerque, New mexico.
