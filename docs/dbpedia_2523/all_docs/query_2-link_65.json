        "text": "“…I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being” (Psalm 146:2)\n\nINTRO.: A hymn which encourages us to sing praises to God while we have any being is “How Can I Keep From Singing?” (Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, #396). The text of stanzas 1, 2, and 4 is attributed to and the tune (Endless Song or Sicilia) was composed by Robert Wadsworth Lowry (1826-1899). The first known publication of the words was on August 7, 1868, in The New York Observer, titled “Always Rejoicing”, and, attributed to “Pauline T.” The song, also known by its first line “My Life Flows On in Endless Song,” was published by Lowry, an American Baptist minister, in the 1869 song book, Bright Jewels for the Sunday School. Here Lowry claimed credit for the music, but gave no indication as to who wrote the words. These words were also published in a British periodical in 1869, The Christian Pioneer, but no author is indicated. Lewis Hartsough, citing Bright Jewels as source of the lyrics and crediting Lowry for the tune, included “How Can I Keep from Singing?” in the 1872 edition of the Revivalist. The famous gospel songwriter Ira D. Sankey (1840-1908) published his own musical setting (Wrocław) of the words in Gospel Hymns, No. 3 (1878), writing that the words were anonymous, but some sources confuse the picture even further by wrongly suggesting that the original melody is actually a composition by Sankey. In 1888, Henry S. Burrage listed this hymn as one of those for which Lowry had written the music, but not the lyrics. The song is frequently, though erroneously, cited as a traditional Quaker or Shaker hymn. Though it is not, in fact, a Quaker hymn, twentieth-century Quakers adopted it as their own and use it widely today.\n\nDuring the 20th century, this hymn was not widely used in congregational worship. It was published in the 1908 Seventh-day Adventist hymnal, Christ In Song, under the title “How Can I Keep From Singing?” Diehl’s index to a large number of hymnals from 1900 to 1966 indicates that only one other hymnal included it, the 1941 edition of The Church Hymnal of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, where it is titled “My Life Flows On.” Doris Plenn learned the original hymn from her North Carolina grandmother, who reportedly believed that it dated from the early days of the Quaker movement. Plenn contributed an additional stanza around 1950. It is often placed as stanza 3. Pete Seeger learned a version of this song from Plenn, a family friend. His version, mistakenly credited as a “traditional Quaker hymn,” made this song fairly well known in the folk revival of the 1960s. Seeger’s version omits or modifies much of the Christian wording of the original, and adds Plenn’s verse, which was taken up by other folk revivalists. In the late 1970s and early 80s, “How Can I Keep From Singing?” was recorded by Catholic Folk musician Ed Gutfreund on an album called “From An Indirect Love,” the music was published in a widely used Catholic Hymnal called “Glory and Praise,” and the song was popular among Catholic liturgical music ministers.\n\nThe song received new prominence in 1991 when Irish musician Enya released a recording of the hymn on her album Shepherd Moons, mistakenly crediting this track as a “traditional Shaker hymn.” Enya’s version follows Pete Seeger’s replacement of some more overtly Christian lines; for example, “What tho’ my joys and comforts die? The Lord my Saviour liveth” became “What tho’ the tempest ’round me roars, I hear the truth it liveth.” In a 1993 recording by Marty Haugen, Jeanne Cotter, and David Haas, the quatrain beginning: “No storm can shake my inmost calm …” is used as a repeated refrain. The song was also included in the Unitarian Universalist hymnal, printed in 1993 and following. It was published in the Quaker songbook Songs of the Spirit, and the original words, with Plenn’s verse, were included in the much more ambitious Quaker hymnal project, Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal in 1996. The United Methodist Church published it in its 2000 hymnal supplement, The Faith We Sing, giving credit for the lyrics as well as the tune to Robert Lowry. The Faith We Sing version changes some of the lyrics and punctuation from the 1868 version. The original composition has now entered into the public domain, and appears in several hymnals and song collections, both in its original form and with a revised text. So, Pauline T.’s Christian poem is again regularly sung in churches as a worship song.\n\nThe song cites several reasons for the Christian to keep on singing.\n\nI. The reason in stanza 1 is that God makes it possible for us to be a new creation\n\nMy life flows on in endless song;\n\nAbove earth’s lamentation,\n\nI hear the sweet (real or clear), though far-off hymn\n\nThat hails a new creation;\n\nThrough all the tumult and the strife\n\nI hear the music ringing;\n\nIt finds an echo in my soul—\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nA. This earth is filled with lamentation because of sin: Mic. 2:4\n\nB. However, God offers forgiveness in Christ that we might be a new creation: 2 Cor. 5:17-18\n\nC. Thus, through tumult and strife, Christians can still hear the music and keep on singing: Jas. 5:13\n\nII. The reason in stanza 2 is that Christ the Savior offers refuge in storms\n\nWhat though my joys and comforts die?\n\nThe Lord my Savior liveth;\n\nWhat though the darkness gather round?\n\nSongs in the night he giveth.\n\nNo storm can shake my inmost calm\n\nWhile to that refuge clinging;\n\nSince Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nA. In this life, the darkness of storms may gather round us: Ps. 107:25-27\n\nB. Yet, the Lord offers us refuge if we cling to Him: Ps. 46:1-3\n\nC. So we can look to Him to give us songs in the night to keep on singing: Job 35:10\n\nIII. The reason in stanza 3 is that we have friends with whom we can rejoice\n\nWhen tyrants tremble, sick with (in their) fear,\n\nAnd hear their death-knell ringing,\n\nWhen friends rejoice both far and near,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nIn prison cell and dungeon vile,\n\nOur thoughts to them go (are) winging;\n\nWhen friends by shame are undefiled,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nA. Tyrants may rule for a time, but God’s people have friends both far and near: Prov. 17:17, 18:24\n\nB. Though some may be in prison cell and dungeon vile, many of our friends are undefiled by shame because God still has His 7,000 who have not bowed the knee to Baal: 1 Ki. 19:18\n\nC. Hence, they encourage us to keep on singing because they exhort us not to become hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: Heb. 3:12-13\n\nIV. The reason in stanza 4 is that the peace of Christ can rule in our hearts\n\nI lift my eyes; the cloud grows thin;\n\nI see the blue above it;\n\nAnd day by day this pathway smooths,\n\nSince first I learned to love it,\n\nThe peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,\n\nA fountain ever springing;\n\nAll things are mine since I am his—\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nA. The Lord has promised to lead us in a plain, i.e., level or smooth, pathway: Ps. 27:11\n\nB. This does not mean that the way will be easy but that we can have the peace of Christ to keep our hearts: Phil. 4:6-7\n\nC. Therefore, we can keep on singing because all things are ours: 1 Cor. 3:21-23\n\nCONCL.: Some variations are noted above in parentheses. Another source suggests that this hymn appeared in an 1864 earlier compilation by a contemporary of Lowry, Anna Warner (1820-1915), who published several collections. If so, this would predate Lowry’s collection by five years. The most popular modern versions of the song take the following portions for the stanzas:\n\n1. My life flows on in endless song….\n\n2. Through all the tumult and the strife….\n\n3. What though my joys and comforts die….\n\n4. The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart….\n\nThen they use as a chorus the following section:\n\nNo storm can shake my inmost calm\n\nWhile to that Rock I’m clinging.\n\nSince love is Lord of heaven and earth,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nLowry was known as a gifted composer of gospel songs on the East Coast of the U.S. Among his most famous gospel compositions are “Nothing but the Blood of Jesus,” “Shall We Gather at the River,” and “Up from the Grave He Arose.” He also composed tunes for others’ texts, such as “Marching to Zion,’ a camp meeting version of Isaac Watt’s text “Come, We that Love the Lord,” and the tunes for Annie Hawks’s “I Need Thee Every Hour,” and Fanny Crosby’s “All the Way My Savior Leads Me.” His work leaves with several good answers to the question “How Can I Keep From Singing?”"
