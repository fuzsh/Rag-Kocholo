        "text": "\"Pork and Beans\" is the lead single and third track off of The Red Album.\n\nAppearances\n\nWeezer (The Red Album) (2008)\n\n\"Pork and Beans\" single (2008)\n\nSeveral Official Bootlegs (Live Version)\n\nOverview\n\nLiner notes\n\nInspiration\n\nThis section requires cleanup.\n\n\"Pork and Beans\" was not originally a part of The Red Album. The song was written by Weezer lead singer Rivers Cuomo after a meeting with Geffen Records that left him fuming. In the meeting, label suits told Cuomo that the album was too slow and needed more upbeat, commercial material, which upset the band. Cuomo then wrote what Brian Bell would later call \"a kickass song\"[citation needed] based on a demo he'd written in 1998 entitled \"Wan and Wistful Silvertone Riff.\" This demo went unheard by fans until Cuomo began self-releasing demos on his personal website in 2020. Cuomo reworked the song's riff and melody into a new song, adding a new chorus and bridge. The lyrics of the song explain his point of view of the meeting with the label. Supposedly, he'd paraphrased actual quotes of the label representatives. Ironically, \"Pork and Beans\" would go on to become one of Weezer's biggest hits ever. Pork and Beans is the first Weezer single ever to lack a guitar solo.\n\nAnnouncement\n\nOriginally, Rivers posted on his official MySpace page that the lead single would be twelve letters and one word that started with T and ended with R. In a revised update, Rivers said that he was wrong about the initial lead single and that the new single would be about a four-legged pink farm animal. He then added, \"You ain't never gonna figure it out boi!\" Many Weezer fans took this as a tongue in cheek comment that the lead single was obviously \"Pig\", which had leaked a little under a year ago in 2007.\n\nOn Albumsix, band webmaster Karl Koch shot this down saying he \"for one would be very surprised if Pig was the first single\", but commented that he did not know of the band's intentions. On April 1, Rolling Stone released information that Weezer's new album was a self titled red album with the lead-off single to be \"Pork and Beans\". Many fans took this as an April fool's joke. Shortly after, a few Albumsix boardies posted a prank online of fake lyrics for the song. On April 12, a clip of \"Pork and Beans\" was posted on Amazon.com, with a release date scheduled as April 24, 2008.\n\nRelease\n\nThe full song was premiered by KROQ on April 15, 2008 -- three days after the initial Amazon clip. That night, Karl signed into the Albumsix chat room to discuss \"Pork and Beans\" with fans. The single was later released as a two-track CD, and on vinyl, in three versions, each with a different B-side. All of the single's various B-sides were cover songs.\n\nReception\n\nInitial fan reactions to \"Pork and Beans\" were mostly positive. Fans were quick to note the guitar tone being crunchy and reminiscent of The Blue Album (something Pat had hinted about on his Twitter page). Fans were also quick to unhappily note that the song lacks a solo. The lyrics of the second verse were initially criticized as well. Generally, however, Pork and Beans is viewed highly by more devout Weezer fans. It has received critical and commercial fame in the mainstream market, and is one of Weezer's most successful singles.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe wildly popular music video for \"Pork and Beans\", released on YouTube on May 23, 2008, was directed by Mathew Cullen. The video contains many internet celebrities and memes - mainly from YouTube - including Numa Numa, The Evolution of Dance, and Afro Ninja. It was an immediate hit at the site, and as of November 2009, it has had over twenty million views. On February 8, 2009, the video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. In August of 2009, the video was named the 3rd best music video of the 2000s by Pitchfork Media. The band would again collaborate with YouTubers in a promotional campaign for 2010's Hurley, appearing in more than a dozen videos on various popular channels across the site.\n\nPersonnel\n\nRivers Cuomo – lead guitar, lead vocals\n\nPatrick Wilson – percussion\n\nBrian Bell – rhythm guitar, backing vocals, keyboard\n\nScott Shriner - bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nJacknife Lee - producer\n\nLyrics\n\nLyric sheet\n\nThey say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair\n\nWork it out at the gym to fit my underwear\n\nOakley makes the shades to transform a tool\n\nYou'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool\n\nI'm 'a do the things that I wanna do\n\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\n\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\n\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\n\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\n\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\n\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\n\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\nEveryone likes to dance to a happy song\n\nWith a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along\n\nTimbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart\n\nMaybe if I work with him I can perfect the art\n\nI'm 'a do the things that I wanna do\n\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\n\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\n\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\n\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\n\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\n\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\n\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\nNo I don't care,\n\nI don't care,\n\nI don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care\n\nI'm 'a do the things that I wanna do\n\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\n\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\n\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\n\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\n\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\n\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\n\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\nKnown recordings\n\nPerformer(s) Title Filename Date of recording Recording location Length Appeared on Notes Rivers Cuomo Wan and Wistful Silvertone Riff 23 wan and wistful silvertone riff.mp3 January 1998 0:45 Alone VI: The Black Room Riff from \"Pork and Beans\" Rivers Cuomo Pork and Beans Pork and Beans (sped up a little) 2.mp3 2007/2008 3:26 Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years Rivers Cuomo Pork and Beans Pork and Beans (sped up a little more) 3.mp3 2007/2008 3:08 Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years Weezer Pork and Beans February 2008\n\nShangri La Studios, Malibu, CA\n\nMalibu Performing Arts Center, Malibu, CA\n\nThreshold Studios, Santa Monica, CA\n\n3:09 Weezer (The Red Album) Weezer Pork and Beans February 2008\n\nShangri La Studios, Malibu, CA\n\nMalibu Performing Arts Center, Malibu, CA\n\nThreshold Studios, Santa Monica, CA\n\n3:09 Pork and Beans (EP) \"Naked Version,\" with electric guitar and percussion removed Weezer Pork and Beans May 30, 2008 3:09 Alt Nation (radio broadcast) \"Weezer Nation\" (Alt Nation \"takeover\" for Sirius XM Radio)\n\nBrian Bell\n\nTay Zonday\n\nPork and Beans 2008 3:20 Released on YouTube Acoustic performance for YouTube Weezer Pork and Beans 2008 3:16 Sessions@AOL Weezer Pork and Beans 2009 3:07 iTunes Originals: Weezer about this table\n\nSee also\n\nList of Weezer songs\n\nJacknife Lee"
