        "text": "On Sunday, January 22, Roger Hall's arrangement of \"The Earthquake,\" a Shaker hymn by Elder Daniel Moseley about the famous earthquke in New Madred, Missouri from December, 1811 to February, 1812, was performed by the Saint Louis Sacred Harp Singers as part of \"Earthquake Sunday\" at the Bolduc House Museum in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.\n\nA simple arrangement of Elder Daniel's hymn, \"The Earthquake,\" was made by Roger Hall and published in Six Shaker Spirituals (PineTree Music, 2001). It was revised for piano and voice in 2011 and that version is available at no charge, providing full credit is given if it is performed anywhere.\n\nFor a free copy of this hymn arrangement, send your name and mailing address to: \"The Earthquake\" hymn arrangement\n\nThese are the five verses for \"The Earthquake\" -\n\n1.\n\nLift your heads ye once afflicted!\n\nLet your eyes with joy behold,\n\nWhat the prophets long predicted,\n\nWhat the Son of God foretold.\n\nNow Jehovah fills his temple,\n\nThence his glory shines abroad;\n\nThere his saints with reverence tremble,\n\nAnd confess that he is God.\n\n2.\n\nSacrifices of thanksgiving,\n\nTo his courts they daily bring;\n\nSongs of joy among the living,\n\nMake his sacred temple ring.\n\nThrough the ranks of vast creation,\n\nNothing can be deaf or dumb,\n\nAll must give their approbation,\n\nThat the day of God is come.\n\n3.\n\nWhile his last call he utters,\n\nNature can no more be still;\n\nAll creation moves and flutters,\n\nIn obedience to his will.\n\nWhen his power is to be proved,\n\nTo convince the stupid soul,\n\nIf he says, “O earth, be moved!”\n\nLo, it rocks from pole to pole.\n\n4.\n\nWhile the judgment is advancing,\n\nSatan’s kingdom to destroy,\n\nFields and forests fall to dancing,\n\nDwelling houses crack for joy;\n\nRivers heave and swell like Jordan,\n\nWater fowls ascend the air;\n\nSoon this earth shall loose her burden,\n\nAll creation does declare.\n\n5.\n\nGod will shake this old creation,\n\nRocks and mountains overturn,\n\nFill the world with consternation,\n\nTill the way of truth they learn.\n\nThose who will not be restored,\n\nSink to their respective hells;\n\nBut our God shall be adored,\n\nIn his temple where he dwells.\n\n-- Elder Daniel Moseley, Union Village, Ohio, 1811\n\nVisit the historic Bolduc House Museum web site, click here.\n\nRead about the New Madrid earthquake at Wikipedia.\n\n\"Reflections On Mother Ann's Birthday\"\n\nShe was known as Mother Ann Lee and was born on Toad Lane [now Todd Street] in Manchester England on February 29, 1736.\n\nIn 1774, she emigrated to America with a few of her followers and eventually settled in a place known as Niskayuna, near Albany, New York. After suffering extreme persecution on her missionary journey throughout New England, she died at the age of only 48 at Watervliet, New York in 1784.\n\nMother Ann's life and missionary work in New England is vividly told in Richard McNemar's powerfuk ballad hymn, \"Mother\" (aka: \"At Manchester in England\") -- available on two different CDs:\n\nLove is Little and Simple Gifts.\n\nMother Ann made extensive missionary travels throughout New England in the early 1780s. In one Massachusetts town she and other Shaker leaders were punished severely and beaten for their beliefs. Though they were severely punished, one of the Shaker leaders overcame that pubishment by singing a song in redemption, known as Father James's Song.\n\nMother Ann was said to be a good singer. Numerous songs and hymns were written in praise of her by later Shakers. One of them was the Shaker hymn which begins:\n\nAll hail the great Millennium!\n\nWhich thousands long'd to see;\n\nWhich ancients prophesi'd would come,\n\nA Glorious Liberty!\n\nThe light of truth rolls brightly on\n\nas doth the Orb of day;\n\nBehold! the new Jerusalem,\n\nThe new and living way.\n\nThis hymn was written in 1840 by Brother David A. Buckingham at the Shaker community in Watervliet, New York.\n\nTitled \"Reflections on Mother Ann's Birthday,\" it has six stanzas. This hymn was first printed in a modern edition by Roger Hall in 1986, published in The Shaker Messenger magazine (Shaker Music Series No. 19).\n\nBrother David's hymn has been recorded on the CD, Verdant Groves, in an arrangement by Shelley Phillips and sung beautifully by Debra Spencer.\n\nHere is the sixth and last stanza which speaks directly about Mother Ann:\n\nWhile we enjoy this day of grace,\n\nHow can we but adore\n\nOur blessed Mother - and embrace,\n\nAnd love her evermore!\n\nO may her blessings still abound;\n\nO may we holy be;\n\nMay we in righteousness be found,\n\nIn low humility.\n\n\"Reflections on Mother Ann's Birthday\" is available in a simple two-part arrangement by Roger Hall.\n\nOther Shaker spirituals about Mother Ann are available on these two CDs:\n\nJoy of Angels: Shaker Spirituals for Christmas and the New Year\n\nLove is Little: A Sampling of Shaker Spirituals\n\nFor more information about these CDs and the accompanying songbooks, go to: Sampler Records Ltd.\n\nLecture-Recital\n\nOn Saturday, August 15, 2009, Roger Lee Hall was keynote speaker in the Scott Swank Lecture Series at the Canterbury Shaker Village museum. He played a few of the songs from his new publication, Gentle Words: Shaker Music in the 20th Century , and rare field recordings of Canterbury Shaker singers from the accompanying CD.\n\nHe also sang what is believed to be the last Canterbury Shaker song, \"My Shaker Home,\" written in 1959 by Sister Lillian Phelps. It was performed for the FIRST TIME in a public program at the Canterbury Shaker Village lecture-recital.\n\nNew Publication and CD\n\nAvailable now is an attractive illustrated book which includes a history of their music written by a Shaker sister, an interview with two Canterbury Shakers, and the lyrics to 25 representative Shaker songs, hymns and anthems, including the best known Shaker song, \"Simple Gifts.\"\n\nRead more at\n\nShaker Books and Articles\n\nAlso available is the accompanying CD, Gentle Words: A Shaker Music Sampler, with the 25 Shaker spirituals, including several versions of \"Simple Gifts.\" To read more, go to:\n\nShaker CD and DVD Releases\n\nBook Review\n\nMillennial Praises: A Shaker Hymnal\n\nNew music for the New U.S. President\n\nA new piece by film composer John Williams, titled, \"Air and Simple Gifts,\" was premiered during the Inauguration Day ceremonies for U.S. President Barack Obama on 20 January 2009.

In 1848, he composed the popular Shaker song, 'Simple Gifts,' (also known as 'Tis the Gift To Be Simple'), while at the Shaker Community in Alfred, ME. This Shaker dance song became known worldwide after Aaron Copland used it in his score for the ballet 'Appalachian Spring' in 1944. Elder Joseph Brackett died at New Gloucester, ME, July 4, 1882.\"\n\nSee also this entry in Wikipedia about\n\nJoseph Brackett\n\nShaker Images:\n\nA Contemporary Adventure Into the Past\n\nby Gwyneth Walker\n\nThe following article is reprinted with permission from\n\nThe New England Organist\n\n(November/December 1994)\n\nIn 1992 I responded to a call-for-scores announcement in the newsletter of the Vermont Composers's Consortium. This was a request by the Constitution Brass Quintet of Vermont for music written by Vermont composers. Since I had previously composed several short works for brass, and was eager to collaborate with the Constitution Brass Quintet, I submitted scores and tapes.\n\nAlmost immediately, I was contacted by Ben Edwards, trombonist in the ensemble, initiating discussion of a commission -- fee, duration of work, date of completion, exclusive performance rights by the players, etc. Once these terms were settled, the Quintet applied for and received funding from the Vermont Community Foundation (commission fee), the Vermont Music Teachers' Association (additional commission and performance assistance) and the Vermont Council on the Arts (Artist Development Grant -- audio recording fee). And I began to consider the nature of the work I would be creating.\n\nI decided upon a suite of movements based on songs of the Shakers -- the religious sect which thrived in the Northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries. These were colorful, beautiful and even humorous songs which ought to lend themselves well to contemporary adaptations. I had done similar 'updating' of Baptist hymns in my Braintree Quintet for woodwinds (with audience singing) which had proven very popular. Thus I was encouraged in my Shaker 'venture'.\n\nAlthough I was familiar with a few Shaker melodies such as \"Simple Gifts\" and \"I Will Bow and Be Simple\", I knew that research into the wider body of Shaker tunes was my next step. And thus I contacted the staff of the Shaker Museum in Enfield, New Hampshire. Song books and cassettes were ordered and received. Help was also provided by a Norwich, Vermont choral director specializing in Shaker music, Mary Ann Wilde. Ms. Wilde sent me handwritten copies of several of the melodies not found in the song books.\n\nI listened to and read through many Shaker tunes in order to select five songs which offered a variety of moods and sentiments. Since I am a composer who values energy, beauty, humor, spirituality, and familiarity of the music, I selected the following tunes: \"Welcome, Welcome Precious Gospel Kindred\" (energy); \"I Will Bow and Be Simple\" (beauty); \"Followers of the Lamb\" (humor); \"I Never Did Believe\" (spirituality); and \"Simple Gifts\" (familiarity).\n\nI should emphasize that the Constitution Brass Quintet placed no restrictions upon the content of the newly-commissioned work. They had liked my previous brass writing, and simply let me create what I felt would be a good work for them. My suggestion of the Shaker Tunes led to a positive response from the players, perhaps mixed with some bafflement as to what exactly I would be writing! And indeed, they would need to wait for nearly a year until the total concept was brought to reality. This project evolved into a long-term work-in-progress, a collaboration of composer, brass players, singers, choir directors and Shaker music scholars.\n\nMost composers work from the general to the specific. And this was the case in my writing. I planned the overall suite -- the ordering of the songs, the tonalities involved, general style of each movement, continuity as well as variety of the tunes, durations of each movement, duration of the whole -- before beginning to place notes on the page. Once I had the broad concept formed, I began my writing.\n\nSince I had several other commissions ongoing (a string quartet, two choral works), the brass music would be done in installments. And this would allow for ample time to confer with the players and to incorporate their suggestions (mostly technical and idiomatic) into the score.\n\nI began with the \"Welcome\" song which I composed in June, 1993. The premiere was given in early July, and although I was not able to attend the actual performance (the string quartet was also premiered the same week in a distant locale!), I worked with the players in several rehearsals. Audience reaction to the new music was very enthusiastic, and the players were pleased with the first 'installment' of their commission. This encouraged me to work on the Shaker Tunes as much as possible. And there was not much time to wait, since we were scheduled to present the first three movements at the Quad-State Music Teachers' Association Conference in Plymouth, NH in October, 1993.\n\nI explained to the Constitution Brass Quintet that my concept for the Shaker Tunes included audience (or choir) singing of the original Shaker melodies preceding each of the brass variations. This would not only involve the audience in the performance, and be enjoyable for anyone who likes to sing (!), but would also lend some historical authenticity to the process of combining the past with the present.\n\nThus, I copied out the melodies and distributed them to the music teachers at the Conference. The premiere of the first three movements involved audience singing of each song -- \"Welcome\", \"I Will Bow and Be Simple\", and \"Followers of the Lamb\" -- followed by my contemporary brass settings.\n\nThis 'second installment' premiere worked beautifully and showed the players and the composer that the singing integrated well with the brass music. The music teachers were enthusiastic singers (!), and their joy 'infected' the playing. Moreover, the one humorous movement, \"Followers of the Lamb\", (complete with tuba cadenza) was met with unanimous laughter. Only live concert experience will serve as a test of this element of music!\n\nThe first three movements were completed. In response to audience questions about the background of the individual Shaker songs, I located a scholar of Shaker music, Roger Hall. Roger has compiled, transcribed and researched Shaker melodies, and published numerous books and articles about this music. Anyone doing research into Shaker music, or even attempting to create contemporary arrangements, would find him an invaluable resource. With Roger's help, I was able to provide dates and locations of the origins of the melodies I had selected for my suite. And I have continued to contact Roger with additional questions concerning the background of my material.\n\nMovements IV and V, \"I Never Did Believe\" and \"Simple Gifts\", were completed during the Winter of 1993-4 in preparation for an April 1994 premiere of the entire set of Shaker Tunes in Warren, VT. Several rehearsals were spent fine-tuning the music. Once again, I listened to the suggestions of the players and incorporated their ideas (articulation, refinements of tempi) into the score.\n\nThe location of the concert would be the Warren United Church, a lovely historic site, ideal for Shaker music! Thus, I asked the choir director, Virginia Roth, if her choir might be available to sing each of the Shaker melodies before the playing of the brass adaptations. She responded with enthusiasm and was able to assemble and rehearse a group of 8 singers. With considerable care, I created simple SATB a cappella arrangements of the melodies. The goal was sparse-yet-graceful choral settings that would introduce the songs with beauty while not detracting from the far more adventurous brass adaptations to follow.\n\nThe premiere of all five movements, with singing, was extremely successful. The small choir was able to master the SATB arrangements in one rehearsal, and performed with confidence and fine singing. The audience was encouraged to sing along with the choir on the refrains of the songs, which they did easily. And the ensuing brass music followed immediately on the closing notes of each song.\n\nThe creation of the Shaker Tunes for brass quintet spanned a year. At several stages, revisions were made according to live performance evaluations. Attention was given not only to the brass writing, but also to refining the choral arrangements to the point where they could be performed comfortably by a small choir of average singers.\n\nThe completed work adds up to about 1/2 hour of music, with 20 minutes of brass music and 10 minutes of singing. This has been used often as the second half of a concert program. The intended audience spans all ages and all levels of musical sophistication.\n\nThe reaction of many of the choir directors has been that this music can and has been used with a worship service. Certainly, the choir can sing the a cappella arrangements as they wish. However, the singing followed by the brass playing is also suited to sacred use. The \"Welcome\" song makes a lively prelude, while \"I Will Bow and Be Simple\" and \"I Never Did Believe\" can be performed as anthem and offertory. And \"Simple Gifts\", with congregation singing followed by the rousing brass adaptation, might be a festive postlude. This is music from the American sacred tradition. The tunes are rough-hewn and direct. The brass music is lively and clean.\n\nI have enjoyed my year spent creating the Shaker Tunes for brass quintet. What started out as a 'generic' commission for brass quintet led to a project which incorporated singing and Shaker music. It provided music which is equally suited to concert hall and church presentations. And although brass quintets are often brought into churches for special occasions, they do not usually perform American music from the 'folk' tradition, as the Shaker music is often considered. Thus, the Shaker Tunes are somewhat unique to the repertoire.\n\nThe process of arranging pre-existing musical material is of interest to me, although I do not specialize in this genre. Most of my works are newly-composed. Yet the idea of taking musical ideas from the past and looking at them in a contemporary was is intriguing.\n\nThere are many approaches to creating arrangements, and these range from rather straightforward transcriptions to idiosyncratic 'departures', in the manner of Charles Ives. I tend towards the latter. This is not by choice so much as by personality. I find it impossible to 'represent' what has gone before. And I seem to find humor and character hiding behind almost any musical gesture!\n\nThus, it is my inclination and pleasure to search out what I feel to be the essence and the charm of each song and then try to enhance these traits through new adaptations. For this reason, I prefer to describe these contributions as 'updated versions' rather than arrangements. I shall explain.\n\nThe opening \"Welcome\" song is a joyful song of greeting which makes the listener feel welcome through the repetition of the word 'welcome' in a bouncy 6/8 meter. I envisioned the Shakers welcoming new members to their community with waving of hands and leaps of joy. Therefore, in the brass version, while the melody is given to the horn, the trumpets answer with 'welcome' (2-note) patterns initiated by grace notes to signify the group waving and shouting \"welcome!\" Later the trumpets flutter-tongue (i.e., 'wave') impishly. The 'leaping for joy' may be heard in the 'jumping' tripled counter rhythms recurrent in this movement.\n\nIn contrast, \"I Will Bow and Be Simple\" is a song of sparse beauty. The melody is presented first as a solo by trumpet I, then a duet between the two trumpets. Allowing this music to unfold slowly seemed the most appropriate approach. And the implicit harmonization of the tune, which reaches the lowered Mediant (Gb in the key of Eb major) near the end, is emphasized in the brass version by an entire middle section created in that tonality. The music ends with the tuba alone on a high Eb (Eb1) as the other instruments fade away. I felt that the ending should portray the same 'solitary beauty' as the opening, perhaps with the heighted poignancy of an instrument stranded at the limits of its range.\n\n\"Simple Gifts\" presented a challenge in finding a new interpretation, since so many fine arrangements already exist. I settled upon a rhapsodic approach for the opening leading into a very lively presentation, with occasional jazz elements interspersed. The tune shifts among the instruments, but is nearly always present in one form or another (as requested by my brass players!). I have always considered\"Simple Gifts\" as a quintessentially 'American' song, and the brash rhythms and open harmonies which I selected aim to enhance this quality.\n\nThe Shaker Tunes for brass quintet may be viewed as character pieces based on Shaker melodies. Liberties are taken with the original songs. But the tunes are truly loved and enjoyed! The goal was to create new music for brass quintet -- both entertaining and sincere -- which might bring renewed life and attention to the Shaker music of the past."
