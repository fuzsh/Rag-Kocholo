        "text": "You try to play cool like you just don′t care\n\nBut soon I'll be playing in your underwear\n\nI′m like a mage with the magic spell\n\nYou come like a dog when I ring your bell\n\nI got the money, and I got the fame\n\nYou got the hots to ride on my plane\n\nYou giving me all that I desire\n\n'Cause down with me I'm taking you higher\n\nI′m the baddest of the bad\n\nI′m the best that you've ever had\n\nI′m the tops, I'm the thing\n\nAll the girls get up when I sing, yeah\n\nI′m the meanest in the place\n\nStep up, I'll mess with your face\n\nI don′t care where you are\n\nLook up and follow the star\n\nI, I'm gonna tear down the wall\n\nI may not be here when you call\n\nSo best be giving me your all\n\nAfter the havoc that I'm gonna wreak\n\nNo more words will critics have to speak\n\nI′ve got the answers to the tangled knot\n\nSleep tight in your cot\n\nOh baby, I′ve been told I'm going crazy\n\nOh baby, well I can′t be held down\n\nOh baby, somehow I'm keeping it steady\n\nOh baby, I′m tearing up this town\n\nHey, this is what I like\n\nCut my heart with a martyr's spike\n\nHey, this is nothing new\n\nI′ve got more than enough for you\n\nI can take on anybody\n\nI can do my thing\n\nI don't wanna hurt nobody, but a bee has got to sting\n\nI'mma fix it if you mix it up, hoot, hoot\n\nTalk smack, and I′m-a gonna shut you up, hoot, hoot\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI was born to give (I was born to give)\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived, oh\n\nRadioactive (radioactive)\n\nSomebody said all the world′s a stage\n\nAnd each of us is a player\n\nThat's what I′ve been tryin' to tell you\n\nIn Act 1, I was struggling to survive\n\nNobody wanted my action dead or alive\n\nAct 2, I hit the big time\n\nAnd bodies be all up on my behind\n\nAnd I can′t help myself because I was born to shine\n\nAnd if you don't like it, you can shove it\n\nBut you don′t like it, you love it\n\nSo I'll be up here in a rage\n\n'Til they bring the curtain down on the stage\n\nI′m the greatest man that ever lived (I′m the greatest man that ever lived)\n\nI'm the greatest man that ever lived (I′m the greatest man that ever lived)\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI was born to give and give and give\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nRadioactive (radioactive)\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lives\n\nI was born to give\n\nWriter(s): Rivers Cuomo<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
