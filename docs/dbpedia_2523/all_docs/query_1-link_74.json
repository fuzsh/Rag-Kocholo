        "text": "CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio — Weezer’s career, for the past two decades, has involved revisiting the highs of its early years, while also trying to carve out a reputation beyond them.\n\nOn Friday night at Blossom Music Center, the influential Los Angeles alternative rock quartet seemed intent on showing that its more recent work can stand beside tunes from its 1994 self-titled debut and 1996′s “Pinkerton,” generally (and rightly) considered its high watermark. And to the band’s credit, the case its entertaining, high-energy and loud 90-minute show made to that effect was fairly strong.\n\nThe band is on tour this summer as part of what it calls its “Indie Rock Road Trip.” Frontman and guitarist Rivers Cuomo, early on in the 24-song set, described the show as “a journey through time, starting in 1994 and ending up right here, right now.\n\n“Buckle up,” he told the crowd.\n\nCuomo, guitarist Brian Bell, bassist (and Ohio native) Scott Shriner and drummer Patrick Wilson came roaring out of the gate with “My Name Is Jonas” and didn’t let up until the last notes of show closer “Buddy Holly.” In the middle were hits, album cuts and rarities from throughout the band’s career, sometimes played as medleys to keep the pacing brisk.\n\nPlaying in front of a setup that looked like a car dashboard and windshield, the alternative rock mainstays are now in their 50s yet still play crunchy guitar rock as if they are young men. Cuomo sometimes sounded like he was boasting when he sang, creating an interesting juxtaposition since many of the famously bespectacled frontman’s lyrics are about his own insecurities.\n\nThe members were also not afraid to lean into the cheesy aspects of rock concerts. Early on, Cuomo turned a huge volume knob to the right, jokingly making the band louder in the process. He remarked that no “road trip” is complete without a family photo taken by dad before he took out a Polaroid camera and snapped a pic.\n\nAnd he told corny jokes, such as one about he and the band getting “admitted” to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Thursday.\n\n“When I say admitted, they let us in the front door with everybody else,” he said.\n\nStill, the focus was squarely on the music. Early period classics like “El Scorcho” and “Undone - The Sweater Song” sat comfortably beside later tunes like “Beverly Hills,” “All My Favorite Songs” and the aptly-titled set closer “Thank You and Good Night.”\n\nThe band knows, however, that its early material is what attracts the large crowds. Half of the setlist consisted of songs recorded in the 1990s. It is nice to know, though, that the band continues to put out music that can still sit confidently alongside its early triumphs, even if it may never top them.\n\nModest Mouse, an indie rock band that has been around nearly as long as Weezer, opened with an hour-long set of deranged sea shanties, trash funk and guitar freakouts.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, ‘G-----n, Weezer let themselves go,” frontman and guitarist Isaac Brock joked at the outset.\n\nThe sextet gave the crowd what it wanted — run-throughs of popular songs like “Float On,” “Ocean Breathes Salty” and “Dashboard” — during a set that spanned the band’s nearly 30-year career. The performance was alternately thrilling and sloppy, with Brock’s vocals and guitar work missing the mark a few times early on before the band found its footing on the tune “Tiny Cities Made of Ashes.”\n\nAnd Momma, the relative newcomer on the tour, warmed up the still-arriving crowd with its 1990s alternative rock-inspired tunes. The quartet, led by Allegra Weingarten and Etta Friedman, blended mostly quiet, sometimes harmonizing vocals with blaring guitars, often bringing to mind Ohio’s own The Breeders. However, the band’s harmonic-laden riffs and catchy melodies save it from being mere revivalists.\n\nSetlist\n\n1. My Name Is Jonas\n\n2. Beverly Hills\n\n3. Return to Ithaka\n\n4. The Good Life\n\n5. Pork and Beans (with “1 More Hit” intro)\n\n6. Pink Triangle\n\n7. El Scorcho (with Momma)\n\n8. I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams (with Momma)\n\n9. Blast Off! (Rivers Cuomo song)\n\n10. Undone - The Sweater Song\n\n11. I Want a Dog (Rivers solo acoustic; tour debut)\n\n12. Susanne (Acoustic)\n\n13. Only in Dreams (Rivers solo acoustic, band came in during first chorus)\n\n14. The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\n\n15. Island in the Sun\n\n16. Perfect Situation\n\n17. All My Favorite Songs\n\n18. Say It Ain’t So\n\n19. Run, Raven, Run (Solo only)\n\n20. Hash Pipe\n\n21. Thank You and Good Night\n\nEncore:\n\n22. The Waste Land\n\n23. Surf Wax America\n\n24. Buddy Holly"
