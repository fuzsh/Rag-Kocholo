[ [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19830818/page/39 Spring '08 LPs From Madonna, Coldplay, The Roots, Mudcrutch, Elvis Costello : Rolling Stone ] ] Bass player Scott Shriner was particularly proud of the song saying, \"The song 'The Greatest Man That Ever Lived' is a masterpiece that includes ten different styles of music based around a common theme.\" [ [http://www.warwickbass.com/basssurvival101/artist_ScottShriner.htm WARWICK'S Bass Survival 101 Featured Artist - Scott Shriner ] ]\n\nIn the liner notes of the deluxe edition of the \"The Red Album\", Rivers stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle \"Variations on a Shaker Hymn,\" however when guitarist Brian Bell's mom came into the studio to see them she mentioned a melody from the song sounded similar to a hymn that the choir would sing in church. As a result the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's \"Simple Gifts\" that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.\n\nThe song was released as a downloadable song for the game \"Rock Band\" along with the songs \"Troublemaker\" and \"Dreamin'.\"\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Rivers Cuomo – lead guitar, lead vocals\n\n*Patrick Wilson – percussion, backing vocals\n\n*Brian Bell – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\n*Scott Shriner – bass guitar, backing vocals"
