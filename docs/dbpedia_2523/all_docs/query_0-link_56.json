Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee both produced parts of the album, with the band producing a handful of tracks themselves. Like the group's 1994 debut album Weezer, other band members contributed to songwriting. This is the first and, so far, the only Weezer album to feature lead vocals from all four band members. The album also features more musical experimentation in comparison to their previous efforts, especially shown in such songs as \"Dreamin'\", \"The Angel and The One\" and \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\". Two official singles were released from the album-\"Pork and Beans\" and \"Troublemaker\"-with both becoming successful modern rock songs.\n\nSatisfaction Guarantee* 30-day returns & exchanges\n\nDetails\n\nTrack List\n\nTroublemaker (Side A) , The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn) (Side A) , Pork and Beans (Side A) , Heart Songs (Side A) , Everybody Get Dangerous (Side A) , Dreamin' (Side B) , Thought I Knew (Side B) , Cold Dark World (Side B) , Automatic (Side B) , The Angel and the One (Side B)\n\n*See our return policy for details."
