        "text": "I heard a 30 second clip of one of the new songs the other week....\n\nWasn't too bad... I told my friend who sent the file to me, that \"I liked the last 15 seconds the best\"\n\nNothing can top the Blue Album or Pinkerton..... But I'll still check this out, hopefully they can make something special again...\n\nThe Green Album was ok.\n\nI actually liked \"Maladroit\" (not many people do, I know)..\n\nI thought the last one \"Make Believe\" was terrible (some people on the forum liked it).\n\nI'll give them another shot.\n\nGo to Weezer.com to hear \"Pork n Beans.\"\n\nThe Green Album was good. But they abandoned many GREAT songs for it.\n\nMaladroit was friggin' HORRIBLE. They also abandoned many killer songs for it. And the earlier versions of each song were better then what came out on the album.\n\nMake Believe was half good.. half ***.. they should have put \"I Was Made for You\" on there."
