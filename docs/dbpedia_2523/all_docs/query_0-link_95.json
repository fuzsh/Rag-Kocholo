        "text": "Photo by Kathryn Yu\n\nRejoice, all ye who ache for more raw, uncut Cuomo: on Amazon.com at the moment, there's a relatively info-free spot reserved for Alone 2: The Home Recordings, yet another demos collection from Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo. If Amazon is to be believed-- and anyone still holding onto the notion that the Kindle is a thing that people want is pretty goddamned serious-- the set drops November 25 from Universal Music Group.\n\nWeezer's camp isn't confirming anything just yet, but those Amazon folks don't exactly pull these listings out of their asses either. Thanks to reader Kel Sanders for the tip.\n\nFrom the sounds of things, Alone 2 might be the only batch of new-to-you Cuomo cuts for a while, as the band will not, as previously reported, hit the studio immediately after their current tour to work up a new slotMusicalbum.\n\nIn other news, a recent Dallas Observer report suggests that Weezer's next official single off The Red Album will be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" (guess the digital version didn't count), and that we may well have a Spike Jonze-directed video for the track to look forward to.\n\nWeezer:\n\n10-17 San Diego, CA - Cox Arena *^\n\n10-18 Phoenix, AZ - Arizona State Fair *\n\n10-20 Austin, TX - Frank Erwin Center *\n\n10-21 Grand Prairie, TX - Nokia Theater *\n\n10-23 Houston, TX - Reliant Arena *\n\n10-25 Duluth, GA - Gwinnett Arena *"
