        "text": "Party like it's 1994 with Wilco, Weezer in Des Moines\n\nYou can file this year's 80/35 Music Festival under W for headliners Weezer and Wilco. They're two of the biggest acts the festival has ever booked. Thanks to Weezer's many hits, it's also one of the more radio-friendly lineups the festival has had.\n\nWilco visits central Iowa every few years (most recently in 2011), but it's been 13 years since Weezer last visited the 515 area code. The band has released six albums since then. So here's a primer on the band.\n\nThe Iowa connection\n\nWeezer guitarist Brian Bell was born in Iowa City, though he was raised in Knoxville, Tenn. That makes him the first Iowa-born musician to headline the main stage at the 80/35 Music Festival.\n\nBell is also the lead singer of the band The Relationship, which recently released a new single, \"Oh Allen,\" off its forthcoming second album.\n\nThe band has another slight Iowa tie: Weezer's 2008 single \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn),\" featured the band doing its take on 11 different acts/musical styles. Slipknot inspired the song's second segment.\n\nRocking out like it's '94\n\n1994 was a big year for 80/35's headlining acts. That was the year Weezer released its debut self-titled album (\"The Blue Album\"), hitting it big with the hits \"Buddy Holly,\" \"Undone â€” The Sweater Song\" and \"Say It Ain't So.\"\n\nThe music videos for \"Buddy Holly\" and \"Undone\" were directed by Spike Jonze, who went on to direct the films \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Her.\"\n\nWeezer's debut album was produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars. On Weezer's 2014 album, \"\"Everything Will Be Alright In The End,\" the band reunited with their original producer.\n\nIn 1994 the alternative country band Uncle Tupelo broke up due to an acrimonious relationship between members Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy. Tweedy and the rest of Uncle Tupelo formed Wilco just days after their previous band's final show and started recording the album \"A.M.\" that year.\n\nA spectrum of albums\n\nWeezer's 1994 album is self-titled, but so is its 2001 album. And its 2008 album. To head off potential confusion, the albums are generally referred to by the colors that dominate their cover: \"The Blue Album\" (1994), \"The Green Album\" (2001) and \"The Red Album (2008).\n\nThe latter two albums came after breaks for the band. Following the (initial) commercial and critical failure of 1996's \"Pinkerton,\" Weezer took nearly three years off before reuniting to work on \"The Green Album.\"\n\nWeezer went on hiatus again following 2005's \"Make Believe.\" During that time frontman Rivers Cuomo completed his degree at Harvard and got married. After about two years off, Weezer got back together for \"The Red Album.\"\n\n80/35 Music Festival\n\nWhen: Starts at 5 p.m. Friday, noon Saturday\n\nWhere: Western Gateway Park, downtown\n\nCost: $44 per day or $75 for both days in advance, $50 per day or $90 for both days at the gate"
