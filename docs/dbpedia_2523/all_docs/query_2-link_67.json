        "text": "Gordon Lightfoot sang a song\n\nAbout a boat that sank in the lake\n\nAt the break of the morning\n\nA Cat named Stevens found a faith he could believe in\n\nAnd Joan Baez\n\nI never listened to too much jazz\n\nBut hippie songs could be heard in our pad\n\nEddie Rabbitt sang about how much he loved a rainy night\n\nABBA, Devo, Benatar were there the day John Lennon died\n\nMr. Springsteen said he had a hungry heart\n\nGrover Washington was happy on the day he topped the chart\n\nThese are the songs\n\nThese are my heart songs\n\nThey never feel wrong\n\nAnd when I wake for goodness sake\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nQuiet Riot got me started with the bangin′ of my head\n\nIron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer taught me how to shred\n\nI got to admit though\n\nSometimes I would listen to the radio\n\nDebbie Gibson\n\nTell me that you think we're all alone\n\nMichael Jackson′s in the mirror\n\nI gotta have faith if I want to see clear\n\nNever gonna give you up\n\nWish me love, a wishing well\n\nIt takes two to make a thing go right\n\nIf the Fresh Prince starts a fight\n\nDon't you worry for too long\n\n'Cause you know\n\nThese are the songs\n\nThese are my heart songs (these are my songs)\n\nThey never feel wrong (never feel wrong)\n\nAnd when I wake for goodness sake (these are my songs)\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nBack in 1991\n\nI wasn′t havin′ any fun\n\n'Til my roommate said\n\n\"Come on\" and put a brand new record on\n\nHad a baby on it\n\nHe was naked on it\n\nThen I heard the chords\n\nThat broke the chains I had upon me\n\nGot together with my bros\n\nIn some rehearsal studios\n\nThen we played our first rock show\n\nAnd watched the fanbase start to grow\n\nWe signed the deal that gave the dough\n\nTo make a record of our own\n\nSong come on the radio\n\nNow people go, \"This is the song.\"\n\nThese are my heart songs (these are my songs)\n\nThey never feel wrong (never feel wrong)\n\nAnd when I wake for goodness sake\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nThese are the songs I keep singing\n\nWriter(s): Cuomo Rivers<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
