        "text": "Traditional Shaker song written by Elder Joseph Brackett\n\nFor the American folk band, see Simple Gifts (band).\n\nSimple GiftsGenreShaker music, dance musicTextattr. Joseph BrackettLanguageEnglishMeterIrregular with refrainComposed1848\n\n\"Simple Gifts\" is a Shaker song written and composed in 1848, generally attributed to Elder Joseph Brackett from Alfred Shaker Village. It became widely known when Aaron Copland used its melody for the score of Martha Graham's ballet, Appalachian Spring, premiered in 1944.[1]\n\nBackground and composition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tune and lyrics were written by Elder Joseph Brackett (1797–1882) of the Alfred, Maine Shaker community, although there is some disagreement as to which community Elder Joseph belonged to when the song was written. Elder Joseph resided with the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in New Gloucester, Maine community before he was called to serve in the Ministry in 1848.[2] For the next decade, he served the Community in Alfred, later returning to New Gloucester. However, the Alfred community's history makes no reference to \"Simple Gifts\", although there are several mentions of Elder Joseph.[3]\n\nThe first known reference to \"Simple Gifts\" is an advertisement for a concert in October 1848 by the Shaker Family from the Society of Shakers of New Gloucester, Maine.[4]\n\nResurgence and enduring popularity\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal videos 'Tis a Gift to be Simple -- Shaker folk song, 2:04, Saint Andrews Episcopal Church, Seattle I Danced in the Morning (LORD OF THE DANCE), 3:55, First-Plymouth Church Lincoln Nebraska-Videos\n\nThe song was largely unknown outside Shaker communities until Aaron Copland used its melody for the score of Martha Graham's ballet, Appalachian Spring, first performed in 1944. (Shakers once worshipped on Holy Mount, in the Massachusetts portion of the Appalachians). Copland used \"Simple Gifts\" a second time in 1950 in his first set of Old American Songs for voice and piano, which was later orchestrated.\n\nLyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nCopland used Brackett's original verse for the lyrics to his one-verse song:\n\n'Tis the gift to be simple, 'tis the gift to be free\n\n'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be,\n\nAnd when we find ourselves in the place just right,\n\n'Twill be in the valley of love and delight.\n\nWhen true simplicity is gained,\n\nTo bow and to bend we shan’t be ashamed,\n\nTo turn, turn will be our delight,\n\nTill by turning, turning we come 'round right.[5]\n\nSeveral Shaker manuscripts indicate that this is a \"dancing song\" or a \"quick dance\".[6] \"Turning\" is a common theme in Christian theology, but the references to \"turning\" in the last two lines have also been identified as dance instructions. When the traditional dance is performed properly, each dancer ends up where they started, \"come 'round right\".\n\nTune\n\n[edit]\n\nA manuscript of Mary Hazzard of the New Lebanon, New York Shaker community records this original version of the melody.\n\nThe song resembles, to a slight extent, several repetitions of the opening measures of William Byrd's renaissance composition, \"The Barley Break\", which Byrd intended to imitate country children playing a folk game.[citation needed] Similarly, Brackett is claimed to have come up with the song as an imitation of what folk music sounds like.[citation needed]\n\nA somewhat similar musical theme arises also in a brass ensemble work, Canzon per sonare no. 2, by Giovanni Gabrieli (c.1555–1612). [citation needed]\n\n\"Lord of the Dance\"\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish songwriter Sydney Carter adapted the original American Shaker tune and lyrics for his hymn \"Lord of the Dance\" published and copyrighted in 1963.[7]\n\nThe Carter hymn is also titled \"I Am the Lord of the Dance\"[8] and \"I Danced in the Morning\".[9]\n\nIn 1996, the Carter hymn was adapted without authorization or acknowledgments of the origins of the tune or Carter's lyrics by Ronan Hardiman for Michael Flatley's dance musical, Lord of the Dance. The melody is used at various points throughout the show, including the piece entitled \"Lord of the Dance\".[10] The musical's title and version of the \"Lord of the Dance\" have led to some confusion that the song and lyrics are Celtic; however they are of American and English origin.[11][12]\n\nSubsequent usage\n\n[edit]\n\nJudy Collins included the song on her 1970 album, Whales & Nightingales.\n\nR.E.M. used this song to open their song, \"I Believe\" during the last half of their Work Tour in 1987.\n\nThe song is incorporated into both the opening and closing tracks of the 1990 album Simple Gifts: Instrumental Arrangements of Shaker Melodies by William Coulter and Barry Phillips.\n\nYo-Yo Ma recorded a duet with singer/songwriter Alison Krauss, originally released on his 2001 album Classic Yo-Yo,[13] re-released on the 2005 album Essential Yo-Yo Ma, and later included in Apple Music's compilation, Yo-Yo Ma Essentials.\n\nJohn P. Zdechlik used \"Simple Gifts\" in \"Chorale and Shaker Dance\", a 1972 composition for concert band. In 2004, Robert Steadman arranged the tune for orchestra featuring an off-stage trumpet and a thumping, dance-music influenced finale.\n\nFrank Ticheli composed a variation of \"Simple Gifts\", presented in Simple Gifts: Four Shaker Songs.[14]\n\nThe 1967 album Happy Together by The Turtles includes the song \"Too Young to Be One\", which Eric Eisner adapted from \"Simple Gifts.\"[15]\n\nThe central melody of \"Simple Gifts\" is used in the 2009 song The Sound Above My Hair by German electronic music group Scooter, which utilises bagpipes in the composition.\n\nThe 2008 song \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" by Weezer makes extensive use of the \"Simple Gifts\" melody throughout.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Williams composed a variation for cello, violin, clarinet, and piano titled Air and Simple Gifts. The variation was written specifically for Barack Obama's Inauguration on January 20, 2009. It was performed by Anthony McGill, Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, and Gabriela Montero.[16]\n\nIcelandic singer Jónsi covered the song for the 2017 film, The Circle.[17]\n\nSeveral arrangements by composer Rick Krizman were composed for the tabloid news series, American Journal.\n\nFor many years, an excerpt was used as the opening theme for the CBS News television documentary series, CBS Reports\n\nIt was used in the 1963 Boulting Brothers' film, Heavens Above!.[18]\n\nHannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) sings the song in Alias Smith and Jones in the 1971 (second season) episode, \"The Posse That Wouldn't Quit\".[19]\n\nThe song is performed in the 1990 Shining Time Station Christmas episode 'Tis a Gift.[20]\n\nThe melody appears prominently in the score of the 2023 Bluey episode Relax.[21]\n\nAdditional verses\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo additional, later non-Shaker verses exist for the song, as follows:\n\n'Tis the gift to be loved and that love to return,\n\n'Tis the gift to be taught and a richer gift to learn,\n\nAnd when we expect of others what we try to live each day,\n\nThen we'll all live together and we'll all learn to say,\n\n(refrain)\n\n'Tis the gift to have friends and a true friend to be,\n\n'Tis the gift to think of others not to only think of \"me\",\n\nAnd when we hear what others really think and really feel,\n\nThen we'll all live together with a love that is real.[22]\n\n(refrain)\n\nTis the gift to be loving, tis the best gift of all\n\nLike a quiet rain it blesses where it falls\n\nAnd with it we will truly believe\n\nTis better to give than it is to receive\n\nAnd an additional alternative:\n\nThe Earth is our mother and the fullness thereof,\n\nHer streets, her slums, as well as stars above.\n\nSalvation is here where we laugh, where we cry,\n\nWhere we seek and love, where we live and die.\n\nWhen true liberty is found,\n\nBy fear and by hate we will no more be bound.\n\nIn love and in light we will find our new birth\n\nAnd in peace and freedom, redeem the Earth.[23]\n\nAnother alternate verse:[citation needed]\n\n'tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be fair\n\n'tis a gift to wake and breathe the morning air\n\nand each day we walk on the path that we choose\n\n'tis a gift we pray we never shall lose\n\nA Version Broadcast During Music and the Spoken Word:\n\n'Tis the gift to be simple\n\n'Tis the gift to be free\n\n'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be\n\nAnd when we find ourselves in the place just right\n\n'Twill be in the valley of love and delight\n\nChorus:\n\nWhen true simplicity is gained\n\nTo bow and to bend, we shan't be ashamed\n\nTo turn, turn, will be our delight\n\n'Til by turning, turning, we come round right\n\n'Tis a gift to be simple\n\n'Tis a gift to be true\n\n'Tis a gift to labor 'til the day is through\n\nAnd when we find ourselves in the place so fine\n\n'Twill be in the cool of the birch and the pine\n\n(chorus)\n\n'Tis a gift to be joyful\n\n'Tis a gift to be free\n\n'Tis a gift, 'tis a gift, 'tis a simple gift to be\n\nAnd when you find yourself in the pure delight\n\nThe gift to be simple has led you alright\n\n(chorus)\n\n(chorus)\n\nIn the place just right\n\nIn the place just right\n\n'Til by turning, turning, we come round right[24]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nEdward Deming Andrews (1940), The Gift to be Simple - Songs, Dances and Rituals of the American Shakers, J.J.
