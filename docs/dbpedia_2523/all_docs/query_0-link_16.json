        "text": "Post by pen on\n\nVariations On A Shaker Hymn.\n\nAccording to FMQB, this is the next single from the Red Album, and Spike Jonze is going to work with the band on the video. Personally, I'm a little disappointed as I wanted \"Everybody Get Dangerous\", but I guess as Weezer's \"Jesus Of Suburbia\" this was bound to get some airplay.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nCool. They're going with the best (or better, depending on how you look at it) stuff from this record. As a third single it might be alright with them, it might have alienated others earlier on.\n\nPost by My Life Is A Stereo on\n\nTo steal an overused line from the CHR section this song is 'epic' however, as much as I like(d) it, it probably wont go down as one of my memorable Weezer songs 10 years from now.\n\nPost by Pipa on\n\nNot me. I like this one better than EGD.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong, I like it better too. It's just not a good single choice.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nHey, =W= can really release anything that they want to at this point in their career. And when you can get away with releasing this there's no reason not to really go for it. I think it's a lot more interesting overall than \"EGD.\" But I'd give 'em like 1/3 of a relative grade difference probably.\n\nPost by My Life Is A Stereo on\n\nNot me. I like this one better than EGD.\n\nOverall , i agree, but if I was asked to pick a song for the public to eat up on radio I would think that EGD would be a \"safer\" choice. I'm glad they went with this though.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nHey, =W= can really release anything that they want to at this point in their career.\n\nYeah, look at \"This Is Such a Pity\"!\n\nYeah, you got me there. But this song is coming directly after a #1 and #2 hit. I think it could perhaps peak higher than that one. I don't think of \"EGD\" as a smash or anything, even if it is catchy enough.\n\nPost by pen on\n\nYeah, look at \"This Is Such a Pity\"!\n\nYeah, you got me there. But this song is coming directly after a #1 and #2 hit. I think it could perhaps peak higher than that one. I don't think of \"EGD\" as a smash or anything, even if it is catchy enough.\n\nYou really think this song could go #1? I really don't see that happening. It's a great song, but I think some people might think it's too oddball to do that well. I mean, Pity never went #1. Never went Top 20 even. EGD seems a lot more like a safe bet, that even though it probably wouldn't go #1 either, it might at least do respectably well for a third single.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nYou didn't read my post correctly because it sucked how I wrote it. I mean that this song is the follow-up to \"Pork\" and \"Troublemaker.\" I mean this song may actually get past like #31 or whatever, possibly even the Top 20.\n\nPost by Pipa on\n\nYeah, look at \"This Is Such a Pity\"!\n\nYeah, you got me there. But this song is coming directly after a #1 and #2 hit. I think it could perhaps peak higher than that one. I don't think of \"EGD\" as a smash or anything, even if it is catchy enough.\n\nBut then again, \"Pity\" came after one of the biggest pop/alt hits of the year, a top 10 followup, AND another #1. Sure, it was a fourth single, but top 20 shouldn't have been out of the question."
