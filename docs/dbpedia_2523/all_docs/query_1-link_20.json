        "text": "Red Album Length 2:44 Release date June 3, 2008 (album)\n\nJuly 26, 2008 (single) Lyrics Rivers Cuomo Music Weezer First live performance August 18, 2008 in Los Angeles, CA Recorded March 2008 Other appearances Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years Previous song Haunt You Every Day Next song The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\n\n\"Troublemaker\" is a song that was originally released as an iTunes single from alternative rock band Weezer's sixth album and third self-titled album, Weezer (also referred to by fans and the band as The Red Album). It was released in digital form on May 20, 2008, as the second single from the album. It debuted the week of July 26, 2008, at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts and peaked at No. 2.\n\nThis song was originally planned to be the first single for the album, but \"Pork and Beans\" was chosen instead. Rivers Cuomo has stated the song, along with others from The Red Album, were heavily influenced by rapper Eminem and his \"fun way of using rhymes.\"\n\nWeezer played an acoustic version of \"Troublemaker\" on the May 30, 2008, episode of Alternative Nation on Sirius Radio. The song was released as a downloadable track for the games Rock Band (along with \"Dreamin'\" and \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\") and Tap Tap Revenge.\n\nThe song was also used for TV commercials for CBS's crime drama show The Mentalist, which premiered in September 2008. It is also used in the trailer for Fired Up. \"Troublemaker\", along with \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\", appeared in the documentary Warren Miller's Children of Winter.\n\nBackground[]\n\n\"Troublemaker\" was originally written by Rivers Cuomo in 2006. Cuomo recorded several acoustic guitar demos in 2006 featuring different guitar riffs and vocal melodies. The song's verse lyrics also appeared in a similar demo titled \"Rock Star\" (previously titled \"Special\") based on the guitar riff from the 2001 demo \"Diamond Rings.\" It is unknown if \"Troublemaker\" is derived from \"Rock Star\"/\"Special\" or vice-versa. These demos were released to fans in 2020 as part of the demo compilation Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years.\n\nWhen the label suggested to Weezer to include more commercial material to speed up the album, the band revisited \"Troublemaker.\" The line \"Keep it on the up\" was inspired by Cuomo's friend and former bandmate Kevin Ridel (of Avant Garde and AM Radio). Ridel has stated \"Rivers sure has made my catch phrase popular!\" \"Troublemaker\" is notably repetitive, with a guitar riff and drum beat that play unchanged throughout almost the entire song.\n\nThe song was released as a digital single. A promotional single was also sent to radio. A physical retail single was scheduled to be released in the UK in late September 2008 but never surfaced. \"Troublemaker\" debuted the week of July 26, 2008, at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts and peaked at No. 2.\n\nMusic Video[]\n\nThe music video for \"Troublemaker\" was directed by the Malloy Brothers and was released on October 6, 2008. The video features Weezer and a selected group of fans attempting to break various world records. It was filmed in front of the Great Western Forum in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, California. The video includes footage of Weezer fans playing dodgeball, riding on an oversized skateboard, playing air guitar, and filling a large Weezer logo with nachos, cheese, and jalapenos. Rivers Cuomo is also shown pulling a stationwagon full of Weezer fans with his teeth. The video alternates between scenes of the hootenanny as well as a live performance by the band.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nSee Also[]"
