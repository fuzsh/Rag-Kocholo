In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of the "The Red Album", Rivers stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle "Variations on a Shaker Hymn," however when guitarist Brian Bell's mom came into the studio to see them she mentioned a melody from the song sounded similar to a hymn that the choir would sing in church. As a result the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's "Simple Gifts" that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.

The song was released as a downloadable song for the game "Rock Band" along with the songs "Troublemaker" and "Dreamin'."
