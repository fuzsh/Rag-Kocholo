You try to play it cool like you just don't care But soon I'll be playing in your underwear I'm like a mage with a magic spell You'll come like a dog when I ring yo bell I've got the money and I've got the fame You've got the hots to ride on my plane You're giving me all that I desire 'Cos down with me, I'm taking you higher (yelling over riffage) I'm the baddest of the bad I'm the best that you've ever had I'm the tops I'm the thing All the girls get up when I sing I'm the meanest in the place Step up, I'll mess with yo face I don't care where you are Look up and follow the star (falsetto) I'm gonna tear down the wall I may not be here when you call So best be giving me your all (Bohemian Rhapsody-style choir vocals) After the havoc I am gonna wreak No more words will critics have to speak I've got the answers to the tangled knot Sleep tight in your cot (80s-rock falsetto) Oh baby I've been told that I am going crazy Oh baby But I can't be held down Oh baby Somehow I'm keeping it steady Oh baby I'm tearing up this town (fast-paced rock) Hey, this is what I like Cut my heart with a martyr's spike Hey, this is nothing new I've got more than enough for you (bouncy pop) I can take on anybody I can do my thing I don't wanna hurt nobody But a bee has got to sting Imma fix it if you mix it up Talk smalk and I am gonna shut you up (epic vocals) I am the greatest man that ever lived I was born to give I am the greatest man that ever lived Radio idea (spoken) Somebody said all the world?s a stage And each of us is a player That's what I've been trying to tell you In act 1, I was struggling to survive Nobody wanted my action dead or alive Act 2, I hit the big time And bodies be all up on my behind And I can't help myself 'Cos I was born to shine If you don't like it, you can shove it But you don't like it, you love it So I'll be up here in a rage 'Til they bring the curtain down on this stage (Beach Boys-style overlapping vocals) I am the greatest man that ever lived (x4) (fact-paced pop becoming rock) I am the greatest man that ever lived I was born to give and give and give I am the greatest man that ever lived Radio idea I am the greatest man that ever lived I was born to give Ohhhh!
