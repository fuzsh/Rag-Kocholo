For 80 years, both young and older players have been able to represent the RC Praga Praha rugby team!

The club was founded in 1944 and has had its home base at the field in the Pragovka area since 1955. All home matches have been played there, except for a period in the 1980s when a gas pipeline was being constructed nearby. We look forward to many more victories on their home turf!

The celebration day will kick off with an open touch rugby tournament for the public, complemented by a children's zone featuring bouncy castles and food stalls. One of the main culinary attractions is a roast pig, which visitors can enjoy throughout the day. The afternoon program starts at 2:00 PM with an exhibition match between the Old Boys Pra(g)ha and the Czech Stars. The sporting highlight of the day will occur at 4:00 PM when Praga's A-team faces off against the Czech U23 team. Following this match, a ceremonial event will take place to honor Pragovka legends for their contributions to the club. The celebrations will culminate in a cultural program starting at 7:00 PM, featuring the legendary band VÃ­tkovo kvarteto.

So come to the Pragovka field on June 15th and be part of the grand celebration of RC Praga Praha's 80th anniversary.
