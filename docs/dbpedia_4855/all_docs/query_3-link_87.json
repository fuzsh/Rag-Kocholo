        "text": "Recipient\n\nThe Santa Marta Group and its President, His Eminence Vincent Cardinal Nichols\n\nThe Santa Marta Group combats modern slavery and human trafficking globally. In particular it focuses on bringing together the heads of national and international police and law enforcement agencies along with international organisations to look at how they can work with the Catholic Church to help victims.\n\nThe Santa Marta Group is named after the home of Pope Francis and was initiated by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference for England and Wales. It was established in Rome in 2014 when police chiefs and Catholic bishops came together in the presence of Pope Francis.\n\nHis Eminence Vincent Cardinal Nichols is the President of the Santa Marta Group, Archbishop of Westminster and President of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales.\n\nModern slavery is one of the gravest criminal challenges confronting the international community. The scale of the problem is such that now, according to some studies, it ranks as the second most profitable worldwide criminal enterprise after the illegal arms trade. This exploitation can take many forms including forced labor, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, forced criminality and organ harvesting.\n\nBoth Pope Benedict and Pope Francis continually drew the attention of the Church and wider world to the moral and human crisis evident in this widespread human exploitation.\n\nRecipient\n\nTom Nicholson, Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová\n\nTom Nicholson is an investigative journalist who has covered Slovakia for the past 20 years. He was editor-in-chief at the The Slovak Spectator and head of investigative reporting a the SME daily. Later he worked for the weekly Trend.\n\nHe is best known for making public the ‘Gorilla’ scandal in Slovakia in 2012. ‘Gorilla’ is considered by many the biggest corruption story in Slovak history. It is named after a Slovak Secret Service wiretap file which alleges massive fraud at the highest level of Slovak politics and business. It exposed politicians, public officials and business representatives discussing kickbacks in return for procurement and privatisation contracts and rocked the Slovak political scene.\n\nNicholson lives in Canada and is finishing a book on ties between politics and organized crime.\n\nJán Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová receive a Special Award in memoriam for their courageous commitment to Kuciak’s work as an investigative reporter. The couple were murdered in their home in February 2018 in an attempt to silence them. Kuciak, in his work, focused on politically related fraud. At the time of his death he had been working on a story on the influence of the Calabrian mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta,’ on business and politics in Slovakia.\n\nThe murders caused mass protests and a lasting political crisis in Slovakia. They led to the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet, as well as the head of police. At the time of writing no one has been charged with the murders.\n\nRecipient\n\nSouad Mekhennet\n\nSouad Mekhennet is a German author and journalist of Turkish-Moroccan descent who is known for her critical and insightful reporting for major international news organizations, including The New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The Washington Post and German television channel ZDF. She wrote world-famous books such as “The Eternal Nazi: From Mauthausen to Cairo, the Relentless Pursuit of SS. Doctor Aribert Heim” in 2014. She has covered some of the world’s dangerous conflicts and is best known for her brave reports on radical Islamic movements. Her latest book, “I Was Told to Come Alone: My Journey Behind the Lines of Jihad,” recounts some of her most perilous assignments.\n\nRecipient\n\nVěra Čáslavská\n\nVera Čáslavská was the most successful Czechoslovak gymnast of all time, winner of seven individual Olympic Gold Medals, still a record for all female athletes today. During the 1968 Olympic Games, she took her protest against the occupation of Czechoslovakia to the world stage by quietly looking down and away while the Soviet national anthem was being played during a medal ceremony. Following this public protest – and despite her immense popularity – she became a persona non grata for the new communist regime, was forced into retirement and was denied the right to travel and attend sporting events. After the Velvet Revolution, she regained the recognition she deserved and was elected President of the Czech Olympic Committee. After the 1989 Revolution, she was an advisor to President Havel and served as President of the Czech Olympic Committee (1990–1996).\n\nRecipient\n\nAndres Pastrana\n\nAndrés Pastrana was the Mayor of Bogotá and served as President of Colombia from 1998 to 2002. Already as a journalist and lawyer, before his political career, he had dedicated his life to fight corruption, and the Colombian drug trade that lies at the root of the country’s civil war.\n\nIn 1988, he was kidnapped by the Medellín Cartel, which was pressuring the Colombian government into preventing the extradition of Pablo Escobar and other drug lords to the United States. As President of his country, he was determined to solve the violent conflict with the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups peacefully.\n\nRecipient\n\nJiří Dienstbier\n\nAs one of Czechoslovakia’s most respected foreign correspondents, Jiří Dienstbier lost his job after the end of Prague Spring and held menial jobs for the following two decades. He is a signatory of Charta 77 and helped to restart Lidové Noviny, one of the country’s major newspapers. In 1989 he became the first Foreign Minister of post-Communist Czechoslovakia.\n\nHe played a pre-eminent role in shaping post-Communist foreign policy in a democratic Czechoslovakia between 1989 and 1993 and from Central Europe to Asia to the Middle East. When the Czech Republic and Slovakia separated as states, he played a leading role as a commentator and thoughtful rebel. Finally he entered politics again in the 21st century as a Senator and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nRecipient\n\nKing Michael of Romania\n\nHis Majesty King Michael I of Romania, the last living Monarch who headed a country during World War Two, was deposed by the Communists, stripped of his citizenship, and banished from his own country in 1947. Never forgetting his people, over the next fifty-five years he worked as a mechanic, commercial pilot and businessman. He is famously quoted as saying “The King is head of state but he is also the first servant of the people. Never forget that.” In 1992, he was permitted to return to Romania where he was greeted by over a million people, only to be banished again until 1996.\n\nSecondary Recipient\n\nDavid Hodan\n\nLord Robertson donated the financial part to David Hodan, who first met Lord Robertson in May 2003. Encouraged by Ms Bela Gran Jensen, founder of the “Centipede” movement, he wrote an essay named “What I would do if I were General Secretary of NATO”. Lord Robertson read the essay and asked to meet David, saying that he especially liked the quotation from Charlie Chaplin which David used in the essay: “I am interested in my future because that is where I am going to spend the rest of my life.” The meeting took place within sight of Prague Castle – which David likes to call his “future seat”. A student at the Terezie Brzková 33-35 school in Pilsen (of which Marc Ellenbogen is a Patron), his ambition is one day to become President of this country. As he says himself, he is an “ordinary boy” with the interests of a boy of his age – he reads a lot and works with computers, but he also has a special interest in current world events, politics and medicine. He is particularly concerned about parts of the world where children suffer as a result of military conflict. David is a boy with the courage to say what he thinks, and to have dreams which may come true.\n\nSecondary Recipient\n\nPetra Procházková\n\nMadeline Albright donated the financial part to Petra Procházková, a Czech journalist and humanitarian worker. She is best known as a war correspondent to the conflict areas of the former Soviet Union. Procházková studied journalism at Charles University in Prague. In 1989 she started work at the newspaper Lidové noviny. In 1992 she became Lidové noviny’s Moscow correspondent. Here she began covering conflict areas – Abkhazia being the first. During the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 she was the only journalist that stayed in the besieged Russian White House. In 1994, together with fellow journalist Jaromír Štětina, Procházková founded the independent journalism agency Epicentrum dedicated to war reporting. In the following years she covered events in Chechnya, Abkhazia, Ossetia, Georgia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Nagorny Karabakh, Kurdistan, Kashmir and East Timor.\n\nRecipient\n\nVladimir Ashkenazy and the Conducting Corp of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nMaestro Vladimir Ashkenazy (the Chief Conductor), Vladimir Valek (the permanent conductor), Sir Charles Mackerras and Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi(the principle guest conductors). Askenazy devoted his first years as a musician to the piano. After winning first prizes in Brussels in 1956 and Moscow in 1962, he spent three decades touring the great musical centers of the world. From the 1970s, he became increasingly active as a conductor and held positions with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra and Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin. From 1998 to 2003 Ashkenazy led the Conducting Corps of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, with whom he undertook the major Prokofiev-Shostakovich series in 2003.\n\nVladimir Valek has performed in many major cities around the world like Brussels, Cairo, Copenhagen, London, New York, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, and Vienna to name a few.\n\nSir Charles Mackerras (in memoriam), born in Australia, had a passion for music his entire life and was honered with may awards throughout his life.\n\nKen-Ichiro Kobayashi was the first Asian Conductor to conduct at the Prague Spring Music Festival in 2002."
