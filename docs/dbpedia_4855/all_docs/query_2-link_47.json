        "text": "A Kent rugby team got a big surprise when a visiting Czech team turned up sporting colours identical to theirs.\n\nThe Prague team have been wearing the Canterbury strip since the RAF air dropped kit in the Second World War.\n\nAnd Canterbury Rugby Club were unaware the Czech team had been using the same strip since it was formed in June 1945.\n\nThe coincidence goes right back to 1944, when the RAF made humanitarian food drops to the population of Prague under brutal Nazi occupation in 1944.\n\nThe RAF crew also dropped a box containing a rugby ball and Canterbury shirts.\n\nWhen peace came, the Club Praga Praha was formed 750 miles away in the Czechoslovakian capital — adopting the Canterbury colours of black and amber stripes.\n\nBut it was only when the Czech side started a tour around France, England and Wales that the wartime connection came to light.\n\nCanterbury club chairman Giles Hilton said the visit of the under-13 and 14 sides was a fantastic moment for both sides.\n\nHe said: “It was all an absolute coincidence. We are at the heart of the club’s foundation but had no idea about this beforehand - we found out on the day.\n\n“It’s a long time ago but we would love to know who was responsible for sending the ball and shirts to Prague.\n\n“If anyone knows who or why someone made the package, we’d love to know.\n\n“This goes to show that rugby can reach every community and be a real force for good.\n\n“I am so glad we helped to make a bit of the game’s history.”"
