        "text": "Czech public service award\n\nThe Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award is a Czech decoration given annually to honor individuals who have dedicated their lives to public service. It was established in 2000 by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and the Global Panel Foundation. It is named in honor of the Prague Society's President Marc S. Ellenbogen's mother. The award comes with a 150,000 crown cash prize, which the award recipient passes on to a young person who is embarking on his/her career who has already contributed to the development of international relations. For instance when the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra won the award in 2000, the cash prize was given to Lukas Vondracek, an aspiring musician at the time, who is now recognized worldwide.\n\nAward recipients\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst – Vladimir Ashkenazy and the Conducting Corp of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra\n\n[edit]\n\nMaestro Vladimir Ashkenazy (the Chief Conductor), and the Conducting Corp of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (Include: Vladimir Valek (the permanent conductor), Sir Charles Mackerras and Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi (the principal guest conductors)). Askenazy devoted his first years as a musician to the piano. After winning first prizes in Brussels in 1956 and Moscow in 1962, he spent three decades touring the great musical centers of the world. From the 1970s, he became increasingly active as a conductor and held positions with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra and Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin. From 1998 to 2003 Ashkenazy led the Conducting Corps of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, with whom he undertook the major Prokofiev-Shostakovich series in 2003. Vladimir Valek has performed in many major cities around the world like Brussels, Cairo, Copenhagen, London, New York, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, and Vienna. Sir Charles Mackerras (in memoriam), born in Australia, had a passion for music his entire life and was honored with many awards throughout his life. Kobayashi was the first Asian Conductor to conduct at the Prague Spring Music Festival in 2002.[1]\n\nFinancial Part Donated to Lukáš Vondráček\n\nBorn in the Czech Republic in 1986, Lukáš Vondráček's musical ability was spotted at the age of two by his mother, herself a professional pianist. He gave his first concert at the age of 4, and by the age of 20 had visited 22 countries giving in excess of 850 concerts. Vladimir Ashkenazy was the conductor when Lukáš made his debut with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in May 2002 with concerts in Prague and Italy. Since then he has appeared frequently with the orchestra, including a major USA tour, and concerts in Cologne, Vienna, Lucerne, Bad Kissingen, and Birmingham's Symphony Hall. In 2010, he won First Prize at the 10th Hilton Head International Piano Competition in South Carolina, USA. Most recently, Lukas won First Prize, Grand Prize plus 4 special prizes at the 2012 UNISA Vodacom International Piano Competition in Pretoria, South Africa. In 2016 Lukas Vondráček won the Queen Elisabeth Piano Competition in 2016.[2]\n\nSecond – Madeleine Albright\n\n[edit]\n\nMadeleine Albright served as the 64th Secretary of State of the United States. She was the first woman Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the US government. As Secretary, Albright reinforced America's alliances, advocated democracy and human rights, and promoted American trade and business abroad. Serving as a member of the President's Cabinet & National Security Council for 8 years, Albright was the US Permanent Representative to the UN from 1993 to 1997. Albright is the first Michael & Virginia Mortara Endowed Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service.

She is best known as a war correspondent to the conflict areas of the former Soviet Union. Procházková studied journalism at Charles University in Prague. In 1989 she started work at the newspaper Lidové noviny. In 1992 she became Lidové Noviny's Moscow correspondent. Here she began covering conflict areas - Abkhazia being the first. During the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 she was the only journalist that stayed in the besieged Russian White House. In 1994, together with fellow journalist Jaromír Štětina, Procházková founded the independent journalism agency Epicentrum dedicated to war reporting. In the following years she covered events in Chechnya, Abkhazia, Ossetia, Georgia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Nagorny Karabakh, Kurdistan, Kashmir and East Timor.[3]\n\nThird – Václav Havel\n\n[edit]\n\nVáclav Havel grew up in a circle which maintained Czechoslovakia's independent culture in defiance of the Communist regime of the time. Excluded from higher education, he made his name in the 1960s with satirical plays which contributed to the intellectual atmosphere of the Prague Spring. During the normalisation period which followed the Soviet invasion he took menial jobs whilst his work was published in samizdat. He was one of the first three spokesmen for Charter 77, and a member of the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted. He was sentenced to four and a half years hard labour, resulting in a breakdown in his health. After his release in 1983 he continued to be a leading member of the opposition movement which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989. He was elected the first President of a free Czechoslovakia and subsequently of the Czech Republic.\n\nFinancial component donated to Andrej Dyńko\n\nVáclav Havel donated the financial part to Andrej Dyńko, the editor-in-chief of the independent Belarusian newspaper Nasha Niva. Openly critical to President Lukashenko's regime, and the only major newspaper written in Belarusian, Nasha Niva has become an important symbol of freedom and independence. Dynko is a Graduate from Minsk State Linguistic University, and holds an MA in International Relations. Until August 2000, he also taught at his alma mater. From 2002, Dynko has been the Vice-President of the Belarusian PEN Center.[4][5]\n\nFourth – Lord Robertson of Port Ellen\n\n[edit]\n\nLord Robertson, born on the Isle of Islay in Scotland, was elected to the House of Commons in 1978. After the Labour Party won the elections in 1997, Prime Minister Blair appointed him as the Defence Secretary of the United Kingdom. In August 1999 he was selected as the tenth Secretary General of NATO, and the same month received a life peerage, taking the title Lord Robertson of Port Ellen. For 7 years he was on the Council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) where he now serves as Joint President. He has been awarded the Grand Cross of the German Order of Merit and the Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania and was named joint Parliamentarian of the Year in 1993 for his role during the Maastricht Treaty ratification. He was appointed a member of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's Privy Council in May 1997.\n\nFinancial component donated to David Hodan\n\nLord Robertson donated the financial part to David Hodan, who first met Lord Robertson in May 2003. Encouraged by Ms Bela Gran Jensen, founder of the \"Centipede\" movement, he wrote an essay named \"What I would do if I were General Secretary of NATO\". Lord Robertson read the essay and asked to meet David, saying that he especially liked the quotation from Charlie Chaplin which David used in the essay: \"I am interested in my future because that is where I am going to spend the rest of my life.\" The meeting took place within sight of Prague Castle – which David likes to call his \"future seat\". A student at the Terezie Brzková 33-35 school in Pilsen (of which Marc S. Ellenbogen is a Patron), his ambition is one day to become President of this country. As he says himself, he is an \"ordinary boy\" with the interests of a boy of his age – he reads a lot and works with computers, but he also has a special interest in current world events, politics and medicine. He is particularly concerned about parts of the world where children suffer as a result of military conflict. David is a boy with the courage to say what he thinks, and to have dreams which may come true.\n\nFifth – Miloš Forman\n\n[edit]\n\nMiloš Forman, born in Čáslav, outside Prague, he lost both his parents in the Nazi death camps. After studying in Prague he made his first feature film in 1963: Black Peter, an autobiographical account of a teenager in a small Czech town. He gained international recognition with Loves of a Blonde. Despite this, his next film, The Firemen's Ball, attracted the attention of the Communist authorities and was banned. After the Soviet invasion of 1968, Forman settled in America, winning international fame with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It swept the Academy Awards, winning all five major Oscars. From his earliest Czechoslovakian work through his American period to Goya's Ghosts, Forman's directing remains close to the reality of life; its absurdity and transforming joys.\n\nFinancial component donated to the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek\n\nThe financial component of the award was donated to the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek. The Film Academy divided financial part into three parts of 50,000 crowns each to provide scholarships for students. The first recipient was the 27-year-old student of film, Martin Palouš, who received the Award from Marc S. Ellenbogen on 11 October 2007 at the celebratory opening of the Písek Film Festival.\n\nSixth – Romania's King Michael I\n\n[edit]\n\nHis Majesty King Michael I of Romania (born 1922; died 2017) has twice been Head of State in Romania: from 1927 to 1930 and from 1940 to 1947, when he was deposed by the Communists, stripped of his citizenship, and banished from the country. Over the next fifty-five years he worked as a mechanic, commercial pilot and businessman and, with his wife Queen Anne, Princess of Bourbon-Parma, brought up their five daughters. In 1997 he said in an interview: \"The King is head of state but he is also the first servant of the people. Never forget that.\"[6]\n\nFinancial component donated to Petrisor Ostafie\n\nA student of medical bio-engineering in Iasi, Petrisor Ostafie is an example of someone who, on receiving something, returns more than was given. He proved this by being first a volunteer and then a member of the Board of the Alaturi de Voi (Close to You) Romania Foundation. In addition, he exudes in speaking on numerous occasions about what it means to live with HIV and has become an example for many young people in the same situation. Petrisor has spent over 4000 hours of voluntary work on programs developed by the Alaturi de Voi Romania Foundation and has brought hope to over 200 young people living with HIV.[7]\n\nSeventh – Alexander Milinkevich (Alaksandar Milinkievič)\n\n[edit]\n\nAlaksandar Milinkievič became involved in the local politics of his home city, Hrodna, in the 1980s. Four years in Algiers setting up the Faculty of Physics at Sétif University, had given him a wider experience of the world than his contemporaries. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he entered national politics, becoming Chief of Staff to one of the opposition leaders. In 2005 he was chosen by the United Democratic Forces of Belarus as joint candidate of the opposition in the presidential elections of 2006, to stand against the authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko. He was held by the police before and after the elections on false charges of drunken driving, forgery, drug trafficking and leaving Belarus illegally.\n\nFinancial component donated to Pavel Sieviarynets\n\nPaval Sieviaryniec is a prominent young Belarusian politician leader of the Christian Democratic Party and founder of the Young Front that is one of the most persecuted political organisations in Belarus.

Hundreds of friends attended his funeral in St Thomas's. For his warm heart, generosity, and for all the good deeds he and his wife Helen did while they lived in Prague, the Prague Society had the honor to make him a special recipient of the HRE Citizenship Award in memoriam. This was a special award with no secondary nominee.\n\nNinth – the 14th Dalai Lama\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, is both the head of state and the spiritual leader of Tibet. In 1950 the Dalai Lama was called upon to assume full political power after China's invasion of Tibet in 1949. In 1954, he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, including Deng Xiaoping and Chou Enlai. Since the Chinese invasion of Tibet, the Dalai Lama has appealed to the United Nations on the question of Tibet. The General Assembly adopted three resolutions on Tibet in 1959, 1961 and 1965. In September 1987 the Dalai Lama proposed the Five Point Peace Plan for Tibet as the first step towards a peaceful solution to the worsening situation in Tibet. In 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for the liberation of Tibet. He has consistently advocated policies of non-violence, even in the face of extreme aggression.

He was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO (SACEUR) and a US presidential candidate in 2004. Almost immediately after becoming SACEUR Clark started pushing for NATO membership for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. He became the first NATO commander to visit Prague after the fall of Communism. His legacy in the region is marked by these efforts and Kosovo.\n\nTwelfth - Wesley Clark, Jiří Dienstbier and Andrés Pastrana\n\n[edit]\n\nAs one of Czechoslovakia's most respected foreign correspondents, Jiří Dienstbier lost his job after the end of Prague Spring and had menial jobs for the following two decades. During this time he became a signatory of Charta 77, helped to restart Lidové Noviny, one of the country's major newspapers. Later he reemerged with the Velvet Revolution, becoming the first Foreign Minister of post-Communist Czechoslovakia in 1989.\n\nDienstbier became a hero to millions when, together with then German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, he cut the \"iron curtain.\" The images spread across the world.\n\nAs a politician he played a pre-eminent role in shaping post-Communist foreign policy in a democratic Czechoslovakia between 1989 and 1993 and from Central Europe to Asia to the Middle East. When the Czech Republic and Slovakia separated as states, he played a leading role as a commentator and thoughtful rebel. Finally he entered politics again in the 21st century as a Senator and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nFinancial component donated to Jiřina Dienstbierová\n\nThe financial component of Jiří Dienstbier's award was donated to fund the design and publishing of a new book, \"Jiří Dienstbier – rozhlasový zpravodaj.\"\n\nThirteenth – Wesley Clark, Jiří Dienstbier and Andrés Pastrana\n\n[edit]\n\nAndrés Pastrana was President of Colombia from 1998-2002. As a lawyer and journalist, Pastrana had been dedicated to fighting corruption and the Colombian drug trade that lies at the root of his country's civil conflict already before he became president. As President he was determined to solve the armed conflict - through negotiation rather than force. While Colombia has not found peace to this day, its army found itself in a much better position to face the major guerrilla organizations after Pastrana's term. During his administration Colombia regained the support of the international community that previously had turned its back on it and the country gained economic support and military aid. At the same time he left Colombia's guerrilla organizations politically undermined with Colombians regarding them as terrorists rather than freedom fighters.[14][15]\n\nFourteenth – Věra Čáslavská\n\n[edit]\n\nVěra Čáslavská won seven Olympic gold medals before she was forced into retirement and for many years was denied the right to travel, work and attend sporting events following her protest against the Soviet-led occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968. A signatory of The Two Thousand Words manifesto, Čáslavská was known for her outspoken support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City she quietly looked down and away while the Soviet national anthem was played during medal ceremonies. Her subtle but highly public and widely understood protest resulted in her becoming a persona non grata in the new regime.\n\nFinancial component donated to the primary school in Černošice\n\nThe financial component of Věra Čáslavská's award was donated to eight hundred children, and to support construction of a sports hall at Primary School in Černošice.\n\nFifteenth – Iva Drápalová\n\n[edit]\n\nIva Drápalová refused to cooperate with the StB, the Communist secret police, even when she and her family were threatened. In 1968 she started working for the Associated Press bureau in Prague when, following the crushing of the Prague Spring, nobody else wanted the job. Initially she only agreed to help out as a translator for one week. Two year's later she had become AP's Prague correspondent. After she retired in 1988 she was a translator at Velvet Revolution press conferences and later she worked as a consultant for the L.A. Times.\n\nFinancial component donated to Štěpán Ripka\n\nThe financial part of Iva Drápalová was given to Štěpán Ripka as the recipient of the monetary part of her award.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols is the President of the Santa Marta Group, Archbishop of Westminster and President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wale. Modern slavery is one of the gravest criminal challenges confronting the international community. The scale of the problem is such that now, according to some studies, it ranks as the second most profitable worldwide criminal enterprise after the illegal arms trade. This exploitation can take many forms including forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, forced criminality and organ harvesting.

After leaving office, he worked as a lawyer and international consultant. Genscher passed away at his home outside Bonn in Wachtberg on 31 March 2016, one week and three days after his 89th birthday.

Her release was granted on humanitarian grounds, partly due to her declining health, international pressure, and advocacy from human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the PEN network. Turning to the Buddhist meditation technique of Vipassana during her incarceration, she developed a reluctance to harbor resentment towards the regime for imprisoning her. She believes her prison experiences contributed to gaining recognition for her writing. Until 2016, Ma Thida served as president of PEN Myanmar, an organization dedicated to monitoring freedom of expression issues. Released only in Burma in 1999, her first book, \"The Sunflower,\" had been banned internationally in the early 1990s upon its release.[32]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
