        "text": "Supporters going to watch the Gloucester v Leeds Tykes Zurich Premiership fixture this Sunday will be given the chance to win a fabulous weekend for two in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing the top of the table Zurich Premiership fixture, a team of Gloucester legends from the past will take on a Czech international XV as part of the fundraising initiatives for the Prague Rugby Flood Fund. The Czech team will be captained by Jan Machacek, the Montferrand Number Eight, while Mike Teague, Richard Mogg and Ian Smith will line up for the Cherry Pickers.\n\n50p from every official Gloucester Rugby Club match day programme sold will be donated to the Prague Rugby Club Fund, while a competition running in the programme will offer one successful supporter the chance spend an enjoyable weekend in a five star hotel in one of Europe's most beautiful capital cities.\n\nIn addition to the Weekend in Prague competition, Central Television's Central News South will offer two international tickets to the England versus France game on the 15th February 2003. Also included in the prize will be two tickets to a Gloucester Rugby Club Zurich Premiership home game.\n\nA blind auction will also run at the game as well as on the official club website, gloucesterrugbyclub.com. Visitors and supporters will be bidding for a two-day pass for two people at next year's British Grand Prix and to take their places in the stands at what is widely regarded as Britain's Premier sporting event.\n\nThe support for the Prague Rugby Flood Fund has been very forthcoming and the anticipation ahead of what will be an enthralling afternoon of rugby is high. The Western Daily Press have also lent their support to the day and all this week they have been running a telephone competition in their newspaper. For every 1000 calls, £100 will be donated to the Rugby Club Fund and at the end of the week, up for grabs is £500 cash and a Gloucester Rugby Club season ticket for the rest of what looks like being a promising year at Kingsholm."
