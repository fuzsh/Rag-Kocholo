        "text": "This list includes geographic and personal names, plurals, slang, dialect, technical terms, and acronyms, as well as obscene, objectionable, obscure and obsolete words, and words that have not been uttered in a century, nor used in any written form except a crossword puzzle!\n\nThis list might be useful for Jotto, or in constructing a 5 by 5 word square on the order of the cryptic\n\nS A T O R A R E P O T E N E T O P E R A R O T A S\n\nwhich was deemed a sort of charmed inscription, but whose meaning is obscure. If the word \"Arepo\" is taken as a proper name, it may be translated as \"Arepo, the sower, delays the wheel with his work\", or possibly \"Arepo, the sower, holds the wheel at work\". Three of those words appear on this list.\n\nAnother use is to construct minimal word ladders, where a single letter changes on each step. To change HEART to STONE:\n\nHEART HEARS SEARS STARS STARE STORE STONE\n\nWhile most five letter words can be connected to others, there are troublesome cases (such as POUND to OUNCE) that can be helped by an extensive vocabulary. On the other hand, Donald Knuth asserts that \"aloof\" is \"aloof\", that is, has no neighboring word differing only by one letter. But then, he didn't list \"kloof\"!\n\naabec - an Australian medicinal bark that promotes sweating aadel - a first name aaden - a first name aafia - a first name aahed - expressed surprise or admiration aaher - one who aahs aalen - a town in Germany aalii - a tropical hardwood tree aalok - a first name aalst - a town in Belgium aamer - a first name;
