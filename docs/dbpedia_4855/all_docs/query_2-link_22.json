The franchise will play its games at Marketa Stadium in Prague.\n\nThe franchise will be composed of experienced national senior team members and talented young players, with the aim of boosting the strength and depth of the player pool in the country.\n\nThe Warriors will be the ninth represented country involved in the Rugby Europe Super Cup, joining the already established teams from Belgium, Israel, Georgia, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Spain.\n\n• New format\n\nThe 2023 Rugby Europe Super Cup will continue to be an eight team tournament, as it has been the case for the previous two editions, featuring a mix of professional club and franchise teams.\n\nWhereas the previous groups were based on regional conferences at the initial round robin stage, the pools will now reflect the ranking of teams from the last edition.\n\nPool A will feature two-time winners Black Lion, the Tel-Aviv Heat, Lusitanos and Castilla y Leon Iberians, while Pool B will be contested by the Brussels Devils, Delta, Romanian Wolves and Bohemian Rugby Warriors.\n\nSpecifically tailored for this season, the competition will commence in November after the Rugby World Cup, with 20 games played throughout November and December 2023. Each team will play five fixtures, regardless of their ranking.\n\nThe Round-robin phase will see each team play their pool opponents in either a home or away match during the first 3 weeks of November.\n\nAt the end of the pool stage, three teams in Pool A and the winner of Pool B will qualify for the top semi-finals, while the 4 other teams will play bottom semi-finals. These games will be played the first weekend of December.\n\nThe competition will culminate with a “Grand Final” week-end on December 16-17 where all positions from #1 to #8 will be determined (4 games) and will crown this season’s Rugby Europe Super Cup winner.\n\nThe last game of the Black Lion will be confirmed in accordance with the schedule of their match in the EPCR Challenge Cup.\n\nOctavian Morariu, President of Rugby Europe said: “ This third edition of the Rugby Europe Super Cup proves the attractiveness of the competition with the participation of the Bohemia Rugby Warriors which will allow more growth in a new rugby market.\n\nThe inclusion of the Black Lion in the EPCR Challenge Cup is also a great step forward in the creation of a pathway for European rugby and the development of players, which is something the game greatly needs, as we continue to expand our great game throughout the continent.”\n\n• Competition’s schedule\n\nDates Pool A Pool B Round 1 November 4-5 Black Lion v Castilla y Leon Iberians Romanian Wolves v Bohemia Rugby Warriors November 4-5 Lusitanos v Tel Aviv Heat Brussels Devils v Delta Round 2 November 11-12 Castilla y Leon Iberians v Tel Aviv Heat Delta v Romanian Wolves November 11-12 Lusitanos v Black Lion Bohemia Rugby Warriors v Brussels Devils Round 3 November 18-19 Tel Aviv Heat v Black Lion Brussels Devils v Romanian Wolves November 18-19 Castilla y Leon Iberians v Lusitanos Bohemia Rugby Warriors v Delta Semi-Finals December 2-3 Finals December 16-17\n\nKick-off times will be confirmed in due course.\n\nAll 20 matches of the competition will be filmed and broadcast on linear TV and digital platforms throughout Europe and the world."
