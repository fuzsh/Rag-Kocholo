        "text": "In the 1930s, black performers were forbidden to steal the spotlight from white actors on the American screen. To circumvent this unwritten law, singer/dancer/comedian Josephine Baker accepted the invitation to work in France. The resulting films—Princess Tam Tam and Zou Zou—reveal what segregationist producers in the U.S. were afraid of: a confident, sexy, scene-stealing African American woman who spewed exuberance, expressiveness and raw charisma like an uncorked bottle of champagne. Princess Tam Tam is a Pygmalion-like comedy in which Josephine Baker stars as a mischievous shepherd girl who rises through society to become a pretend princess and the toast of Paris nightlife. Conceived as a vehicle for Baker, then among Europe’s most popular entertainers, Zou Zou was her debut talking film. In the tradition of 42nd Street, it tells the story of a talented Cinderella (Baker) who saves a show and becomes an overnight sensation. Features Josephine's poignant rendition of “Haiti,” sung while clad in feathers and swinging in a birdcage.\n\nThree 2005 Documentary Shorts Focus On Josephine Baker: “The Woman,” “The Performer, ”And “The Films.” Includes Interviews With Actress Lynn Whitfield, Theater Critic Margo Jefferson, Dance Historian Elizabeth Kendall And Baker’S Adopted Son Jean-Claude.\n\nVideo Tour Of Chez Josephine, Jean-Claude Baker’S Culinary Exhibition Of Rare Josephine Baker Paintings And Posters.\n\nThe Fireman Of The Folies-Bergère, A 1928 Short Featuring Baker\n\n...And More!"
