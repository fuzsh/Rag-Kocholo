Princess TAM-TAM is a 1935 film starring the legendary Josephine Baker as a local Tunisian girl who is educated and introduced to Parisian high society.\n\nDon't miss this chance to celebrate and appreciate the rich history of Black cinema at the Gantt.\n\nImportant note: This event is free with the cost of admission to the Gantt. Gantt Center members do not have to pay an admission fee. If you are a member, please be prepared to present your membership card at check-in.\n\nSpecifically designed as a vehicle to expose the community to the vast artistic value black film has had throughout the years, the goal of the film series is to appeal to as diverse a population as possible and further the appreciation of Black cinema.\n\nCurator and host, Felix Curtis, came to Charlotte from the Oakland/San Francisco Bay area where he curated The San Francisco Black Film Festival and Black Filmworks, the annual film festival component of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, where he later served as Executive Director."
