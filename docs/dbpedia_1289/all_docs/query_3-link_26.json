        "text": "Ben Folds is widely regarded as one of the major music influencers of our generation.\n\nHe’s created an enormous body of genre-bending music that includes pop albums with Ben Folds Five, multiple solo albums, and numerous collaborative records. His last album was a blend of pop songs and his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra that soared to #1 on both the Billboard classical and classical crossover charts. For over a decade he’s performed with some of the world’s greatest symphony orchestras and currently serves as the first-ever Artistic Advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center.\n\nIn addition to solo rock and orchestral touring, Folds recently wrote a critically-acclaimed memoir “A Dream About Lightning Bugs,” which debuted as a New York Times Best Seller, and is described as a collection of interrelated essays, anecdotes and lessons about art, life, and music.\n\nHe is also no stranger to television, having been featured for five seasons as a judge on NBC’s critically-acclaimed a capella show “The Sing Off.” He continues to appear in cameo roles on cable and network TV shows, and composes for film and TV.\n\nAn avid photographer, Folds is a member of the prestigious Sony Artisans of Imagery, has worked as an assignment photo editor for National Geographic, and was featured in a mini-documentary by the Kennedy Center’s Digital Project on his photographic work.\n\nAn outspoken champion for arts education and music therapy funding in our nation’s public schools, in 2016 Ben held the distinction as the only artist to appear at both national political conventions advocating for arts education, has served for over five years as an active member of the distinguished Artist Committee of Americans For The Arts (AFTA), and serves on the Board of AFTA’s Arts Action Fund. He is also Chairman of the Arts Action Fund’s ArtsVote2020 national initiative to advocate for a greater commitment to the nation’s creative economy through improved public policies for the arts and arts education, and hosts a podcast series of interviews on arts policies with 2020 candidates.\n\nJonathan Kimble Simmons was originally a singer, with a degree in music from the University of Montana. He turned to theater in the late 1970s and appeared in many regional productions in the Pacific Northwest before moving to New York in 1983. He appeared in Broadway and off-Broadway shows and also did some television — his early roles included the portrayal of a white supremacist responsible for multiple murders in an episode of Homicide: Life on the Street. In that same vein, Simmons first gained wide exposure as Vern Schillinger, the leader of an Aryan Brotherhood-type organization in prison in the HBO series Oz.\n\nParlaying his small-screen notoriety into feature film opportunities, Simmons had a small part in the 1997 thriller The Jackal and played a leading role in Frank Todaro’s low-budget comedy Above Freezing, a runner-up for the most popular film at the 1998 Seattle Film Festival. Also in 1997, Simmons increased his television prolificacy by taking on the role of Dr. Emil Skoda, the consulting psychiatrist to the Manhattan district attorney’s office in the series Law and Order.\n\nBy 1999, Simmons was showing up in such prominent films as The Cider House Rules and the baseball drama For Love of the Game, directed by Sam Raimi. The director again enlisted Simmons for his next film, 2000’s The Gift. After a supporting turn in the disappointing comedy The Mexican, Simmons teamed with Raimi for the third time, bringing cigar-chomping comic-book newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson screaming to life in the 2002 summer blockbuster Spider-Man. In 2004, he would reprise the role in the highly anticipated sequel, Spider-Man 2. That same year, along with appearing alongside Tom Hanks in the Coen Brothers’ The Ladykillers, Simmons continued to be a presence on the tube, costarring on ABC’s midseason-replacement ensemble drama The D.A.\n\nHis career subsequently kicking into overdrive, the popular character actor was in increasingly high demand in the next few years, enjoying a productive run as a voice performer in such animated television series’ as Justice League, Kim Possible, The Legend of Korra, and Ultimate Spider-Man (the latter of which found him reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson), as well as turning in memorable performances in Jason Reitman’s Juno, Mike Judge’s Extract, and as a hard-nosed captain in the 2012 crime thriller Contraband. Meanwhile, in 2005, he joined the cast of TNT’s popular crime drama The Closer as Assistant Chief Will Pope — a role which no doublt played a part in the cast earning five Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\nSimmons continued to work steadily in movies, returning to the Spider-Man franchise in 2007. That same year he co-starred as the father of a pregnant teen in Juno, which led to him being cast regularly by that film’s director Jason Reitman in many of his future projects including Up In the Air and Labor Day. It was Reitman who got Simmons the script for Whiplash, Damien Chazelle’s directorial debut. The actor took the part of an abusive, but respected music teacher and the ensuing performance garnered Simmons multiple year-end awards including a Best Supporting Actor nomination from the Academy.\n\nTubist Samuel Pilafian was noted for having achieved a degree of fame on an instrument that usually fills an accompanimental role. Equally noteworthy, however, was the ease with which Pilafian moved between classical music and pop.\n\nA native of Miami, Pilafian started early on the tuba. He attended the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, becoming only the second tuba player in history to win the school’s concerto competition. That propelled Pilafian to scholarships at Dartmouth College and the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts. While he was studying in the latter program, he was selected by Leonard Bernstein to perform in the world premiere of Bernstein’s Mass, which was simultaneously part of the opening ceremonies for Washington, D.C.’s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nWith his performance of that thoroughly eclectic composition as a starting point, Pilafian developed dual careers. In the classical sphere, Pilafian was best known as a founding member of the Empire Brass Quintet. He also performed and recorded with the Boston Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Pilafian played recitals and made orchestral appearances in Canada, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, Italy, Austria, Germany, and England. He served on the faculties of Boston University and the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, and was a consultant at the Royal Academy of Music in London before joining the faculty at Arizona State University in 1994. Pilafian released 12 solo albums as a jazz performer and recorded with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. With guitarist Frank Vignola, Pilafian formed the jazz duo Travelin’ Light, which released three discs on the Telarc label. While many classical artists have ventured into jazz with notable success, few diverged as far from their original training as Pilafian. He recorded with the rock group Pink Floyd, and under the designation of the Pilafian Project he recorded an experimental mix of tuba sounds that transcends genre categories. An example is the 1998 album Meltdown, which includes music by composers such as Bartók, Sidney Bechet, Ornette Coleman, Ravel, and Captain Beefheart. A past president of T.U.B.A. (the Tubists’ Universal Brotherhood Association), Pilafian served as chairman of that group’s board of directors. Pilafian passed away in April 2019 from colon cancer.\n\nThomas E. Dewey was born on March 24, 1902, at Owosso, Mich. In 1923 he received his bachelor of arts degree from the University of Michigan. After briefly studying music and law in Chicago, he entered Columbia University Law School. After his graduation in 1925, he toured England and France. Returning to New York, he entered the state bar, accepted a clerkship in a law office, and became active in the Young Republican Club. In 1928 Dewey married Frances E. Hutt; they had two children.\n\nIn 1931 the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York appointed Dewey his chief assistant. In addition to fundamental honesty and natural courage, Dewey possessed a capacity for careful and deliberate case preparation and an amazing self-control that enabled him to remain cool under pressure. With the resignation of the U.S. attorney in November 1933, Dewey took that position—at 31 the youngest U.S. attorney ever. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a Democrat to the position 5 weeks later, Dewey returned to private law practice. In 1935 he was appointed special prosecutor for the Investigation of Organized Crime in New York. His campaign against narcotics and vice racketeers obtained 72 convictions in 73 prosecutions. In 1937 he was elected district attorney for New York County.\n\nIn 1942 Dewey was elected governor of New York. He quickly established a reputation for political moderation and administrative efficiency, enjoying cordial relations with the legislature. Success as governor, added to his reputation in fighting New York racketeers, sent Dewey’s political stature soaring. In 1944 he was the Republican party’s presidential nominee. He ran well, despite Roosevelt’s record as a war leader and Dewey’s lack of experience in international affairs. Reelected governor of New York in 1946, he proceeded to ram a series of liberal laws through the legislature.\n\nAs the acknowledged front-runner in his second presidential campaign—against Democrat Harry Truman in 1948—Dewey refused to tax himself, made only a few speeches, avoided controversial issues, and scarcely recognized the opposition. He lost to Truman by a narrow margin. In 1950 he was elected to his third successive term as New York’s governor.\n\nAt the suggestion of State Department adviser John Foster Dulles, Dewey visited 17 countries in the Pacific in 1951. In 1955 he reentered private practice with the New York firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer, and Wood. By 1957 Dewey had been awarded 16 honorary degrees. His books include The Case against the New Deal (1940), Journey to the Far Pacific (1952), and Thomas E. Dewey on the Two Party System (1966). He died on March 16, 1971, at Bal Harbour, Fla.\n\nBontemps grew up in California and was sent to the San Fernando Academy boarding school with his father’s instruction to not “go up there acting colored.” This Bontemps later noted as a formative moment, and he would resent what he saw as an effort to make him forget his heritage. He graduated from Pacific Union College in Angwin in 1923 with an AB.\n\nIn 1924 he accepted a teaching position in Harlem, New York. He married Alberta Johnson, a former student, in 1926; they would eventually have six children. Though his original plan was to obtain his Ph.D. in English, he accepted teaching positions to support his family. Luckily, it was while teaching in Harlem that he would become closely connected to the Harlem Renaissance and befriend major artists such as Countee Cullen, W. E. B. DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and especially Langston Hughes, with whom he frequently collaborated.\n\nBontemps first published his poems in “Crisis” in 1924, and also later in “Opportunity,” both literary magazines that supported the work of young African American writers. In 1926 and 1927, Bontemps win three prizes for his poetry from these publications. His first book of fiction was “God Sends Sunday” (1931), the story of a fast-living black jockey named Little Augie. The book received mixed reviews: praise for its significance as a book by a black author but also criticism for its emphasis on the seamier side of black life.\n\nThat same year Bontemps moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where he had accepted a position at Oakwood Junior College. In 1932 he received another prize for the short story “A Summer Tragedy” and published his first two children’s book, “Popo, and Fifina: Children of Haiti,” with Langston Hughes, and “You Can’t Pet a Possum” in 1934. He began work on “Black Thunder: Gabriel’s Revolt: Virginia 1800,” the story of an aborted slave rebellion led by Gabriel Prosser. The novel, published in 1936, was finished in his father’s California house. At the end of the 1934 school year, Oakwood dismissed Bontemps, a reaction to the combination of his radical politics, out-of-state visitors, his personal book collection, and the school’s own conservative and religious views.\n\nIn 1943 Bontemps received a master’s degree in library science from the University of Chicago. He was appointed a librarian at Fisk University, a position he held until his retirement in 1965, followed by honorary degrees and professorships at the University of Illinois and Yale University, and a return to Fisk as a writer in residence.\n\nHe died June 4, 1973, from a heart attack while working on his autobiography. However, Sterling A. Brown and Aaron Douglas noted that his writings had not received the critical attention deserved, his work as a librarian and historian point to him as a great chronicler and a preserver of the documents of black cultural heritage. His family’s old Louisiana home is now the Arna Bontemps African American Museum and Cultural Arts Center.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti was a best-selling classical singer and humanitarian known for his most original and popular performances with the ‘Three Tenors’ and ‘Pavarotti & Friends’.\n\nHe was born on October 12, 1935, in Modena, Emilia-Romagna, in Northern Italy. He was the first child and only son of two children in the family of a baker. His father, Fernando Pavarotti, was a gifted amateur tenor, who instilled a love for music and singing in young Luciano. His mother, Adele Venturi, worked at the local cigar factory. Young Pavarotti showed many talents. He first sang with his father in the Corale Rossi, a male choir in Modena, and won the first prize in an international choir competition in Wales, UK. He also played soccer as a goalkeeper for his town’s junior team.\n\nIn 1954, at the age of 19, Pavarotti decided to make a career as a professional opera singer. He took serious study with professional tenor Arrio Pola, who discovered that Pavarotti had perfect pitch, and offered to teach him for free. After six years of studies, he had only a few performances in small towns without pay. At that time Pavarotti supported himself working as a part-time school teacher and later an insurance salesman. In 1961 he married his girlfriend, singer Adua Veroni, and the couple had three daughters.\n\nPavarotti made his operatic debut on April 29, 1961, as Rodolfo in La Boheme by Giacomo Puccini, at the opera house in Reggio Emilia. In the following years he relied on the professional advise from tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano, who prevented Pavarotti from appearances when his voice was not ready yet. Eventually Pavarotti stepped in for Di Stefano in 1963, at the Royal Opera House in London as ‘Rodolfo’ in La Boheme by Giacomo Puccini, making his international debut. That same year he met soprano Joan Sutherland and the two began one of the most legendary partnerships in vocal history; Pavarotti made his American debut opposite Sutherland in February of 1965, at the Miami Opera.\n\nPavarotti was blessed with a voice of rare range, beauty and clarity, which was best during the 60s, 70s and 80s. In 1966 he became the first opera tenor to hit all nine “high C’s” with his full voice in the aria ‘Quel destin’ in ‘La Fille du Regiment’ (aka.. The Daughter of the Regiment) by Gaetano Donizetti. He repeated this feat in his legendary 1972 Met performance and was nicknamed “King of the High C’s” in rave reviews. Pavarotti’s popularity was arguably bigger than that of any other living tenor in the world. His 1993 live performance in New York’s Central Park was attended by 500,000 fans while millions watched it on television. During the 1990s and 2000s Pavarotti was still showing the ability to deliver his clear ringing tone in the higher register, albeit in fewer performances.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti was also known for his humanitarian work. He was the founder and host of the ‘Pavarotti & Friends’ annual charity concerts and related activities in Modena, Italy. There he sang with international stars of all styles to raise funds for several worthy UN causes. Pavarotti sang with Bono and U2 in the 1995 song Miss Sarajevo and raised $1,500,000 in his charity project ‘Concert for Bosnia’. He also established and financed the Pavarotti Music Center in Bosnia, and raised funds in charity concerts for refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo. Pavarotti made two Guinness World Records: one was for receiving the most curtain calls at 165; and the other was for the best selling classical album of ‘The Three Tenors in Concert’ with Plácido Domingo and José Carreras.\n\nAndrew Carnegie was born on November 25, 1835, in Dunfermline, Scotland, the son of William Carnegie, a weaver, and Margaret Morrison Carnegie. The invention of weaving machines replaced the work Carnegie’s father did, and eventually the family was forced into poverty. In 1848 the family left Scotland and settled in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. Carnegie’s father found a job in a cotton factory, but he soon quit to return to his home handloom, making linens and trying to sell them door to door. Carnegie also worked in the cotton factory, but after his father died in 1855, his strong desire to help take care of the family pushed him to educate himself. He became an avid reader, a theatergoer, and a lover of music.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1870 Carnegie made money through investments in several small iron mills and factories. He also traveled throughout England, selling the bonds of small United States railroads and bridge companies. Carnegie began to see that steel was eventually going to replace iron for the manufacture of rails, structural shapes, pipe, and wire. In 1873 he organized a steel rail company. The first steel furnace at Braddock, Pennsylvania, began to roll rails in 1874. Carnegie continued building by cutting prices, driving out competitors, shaking off weak partners, and putting earnings back into the company. He never went public (sold shares of his company in order to raise money). Instead he obtained capital (money) from profits—and, when necessary, from local banks—and he kept on growing, making heavy steel alone. By 1878 the company was valued at $1.25 million.\n\nCarnegie spent his leisure time traveling. He also wrote several books, including “Triumphant Democracy” (1886), which pointed out the advantages of American life over the unequal societies of Britain and other European countries. To Carnegie access to education was the key to America’s political stability and industrial accomplishments. In 1889 he published an article, “Wealth,” stating his belief that rich men had a duty to use their money to improve the welfare of the community. Carnegie remained a bachelor until his mother died in 1886. A year later he married Louise Whitfield. They had one child together. The couple began to spend six months each year in Scotland, though Carnegie kept an eye on business developments and problems.\n\nIn retirement, Carnegie began to set up trust funds “for the improvement of mankind.” He built some three thousand public libraries all over the English-speaking world. In 1895 the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh was opened, housing an art gallery, a natural history museum, and a music hall. He also built a group of technical schools that make up the present-day Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie Institution of Washington was set up to encourage research in the natural and physical sciences. Carnegie Hall was built in New York City. The Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching was created to provide pensions for university professors. Carnegie also established the Endowment for International Peace to seek an end to war.\n\nIn all, Carnegie’s donations totaled $350 million. The continuation of his broad interests was put under the general charge of the Carnegie Corporation, with a donation of $125 million. Carnegie died on August 11, 1919, at his summer home near Lenox, Massachusetts.\n\nDr. Roland M. Carter has long been a world-acclaimed composer, arranger, conductor, pianist, teacher, and scholar. His outstanding contributions to the performance and preservation of American music, and especially that of African American musicians, have elevated him to the status of a leading figure in the nation’s choral arts. From presidential inaugurations to small-town churches, Brother Carter has brought music to the masses with a keen ear and a bright mind.\n\nMusic has always been a part of Carter’s life, even from the early years. His aunt, Anne Smith, traveled with a musical group called Wings Over Dixie. “She played the piano, and she could play everything from ragtime to stride piano,” Carter recalls. “There was always an instrument in the house.” After gaining an education from Hampton University in Virginia and New York University, Carter would spend just over twenty years as Director of Choral Music and Assistant Professor of Music at Hampton. In 1989, he would be offered a position at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga (UTC). The opportunity to teach at the university, where almost thirty years prior, he was not allowed to enter because of his race meant a great deal. “To come back twenty-nine years later as department head was an affirmation of how far we’ve come, but also how far we had to go,” Carter says.\n\nNamed the UTC Holmberg Professor of American Music and retired in 2013, Carter accomplished much during his twenty-three-year tenure. He founded The Chattanooga Choral Society for the Preservation of African American Song and led several choirs. In 2003 he was awarded the Tennessee Governor’s Arts Awards as a Distinguished Artist and was elected to honorary membership of the internationally acclaimed Morehouse Glee Club in 2004. He also served as President of the National Association of Negro Musicians from 2002 to 2008.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to his art and humanity, Brother Carter was named to Phi Mu Alpha’s inaugural class of Signature Sinfonians in 2006 and initiated into the Alpha Alpha Chapter of national honorary members. Just last Spring, Carter was recognized with a Master of Spirituals Award for his work preserving the religious music of African Americans.\n\nMore than a century after his public debut, the name Jascha Heifetz continues to evoke awe and excitement among fellow musicians. In a performing career that spanned 65 years, he established an unparalleled standard of violin playing to which violinists around the world still aspire.\n\nHeifetz is widely considered to be one of the most profoundly influential performing artists of all time. Born in Vilnius, Lithuania — then occupied by Russia — on February 2, 1901, he became a U.S. citizen in 1925. Fiercely patriotic to his adopted country, he gave hundreds of concerts for Allied service men and women during World War II, including tours of Central and South America, North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany, often playing from the back of a flatbed truck in dangerous conditions.\n\nIn 1928, he published the first of dozens of acclaimed violin transcriptions. Many, including his arrangements of selections from Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” are now part of the standard repertoire. Using the pseudonym Jim Hoyl, he even wrote a pop song that became a hit in 1946.\n\nIn his later years, Heifetz became a dedicated teacher and a champion of causes he believed in. He led efforts to establish “911” as an emergency phone number, and crusaded for clean air. He and his students at the University of Southern California protested smog by wearing gas masks, and in 1967 he converted his Renault passenger car into an electric vehicle.\n\nAs a result of his vast recorded legacy, Heifetz’s violin playing is no less influential today than it was in his lifetime. To legions of violinists he remains, quite simply, “The King.”\n\nComing from a musical family, trombonist Andy Martin launched his career while still in his teens. His technique and virtuosity quickly established him on the Los Angeles music scene. As an instructor, Martin has influenced countless young players. He has appeared at many colleges and universities throughout the country as a guest artist and clinician.\n\nA world-class jazz musician and Yamaha Performing Artist, Martin is featured as leader or co-leader on twelve albums. These albums showcase his collaboration with other top jazz artists such as the late Carl Fontana, Pete Christlieb, Bobby Shew, and Eric Marienthal. He has also collaborated as a sideman with jazz greats such as Stanley Turrentine and Horace Silver. Martin had a long association with British bandleader and jazz promoter Vic Lewis and was the featured soloist on many of Vic’s CDs.\n\nMartin is well known for his work as a lead player and featured soloist with virtually every big band in L.A. Martin is the lead trombonist and featured soloist with Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band, the lead trombonist, and soloist for The Tom Kubis Band, and was a featured soloist for the Bill Holman Big Band for 15 years. He has appeared in bands led by Jack Sheldon, Louis Bellson, Quincy Jones, Matt Cattingub, Bob Curnow, Patrick Williams, and Sammy Nestico, among others.\n\nMartin has long been one of L.A.’s most prominent trombonists for commercial recordings, television and motion picture soundtracks and live theater. He has contributed on albums for many popular artists, including the Pussycat Dolls, Coldplay, and Michael Bublé. His television credits include the Grammys, the Emmys, the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Martin has been the lead trombonist on television shows Dancing With The Stars and American Idol and has appeared regularly on the soundtracks of major television series such as Family Guy, American Dad, and King of the Hill. His motion picture credits span the soundtracks of over 150 major films.\n\nKrzysztof Penderecki was born in Dębica on 23 November 1933. He studied composition privately with Franciszek Skołyszewski and then (1955-8) with Artur Malawski and Stanisław Wiechowicz at the State Higher School of Music in Kraków, where he also taught, being appointed its rector (i.e., president) in 1972 (in the 1980s the School was renamed “Academy of Music). Penderecki’s career had a very auspicious beginning. In 1959 he came suddenly to prominence when three of his works won first prizes in a national competition organized by the Polish Composers’ Union (he submitted them under different pseudonyms). His reputation quickly spread abroad, notably through perfomances of such works as Anaklasis (written for the 1960 Donaueschigen Festival) and Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima. The latter piece, as well as the Passion according to St. Luke of 1963-5, found an unusually wide audience for contemporary works, and Penderecki soon received important commissions from diverse organizations in Europe and the USA. He has also appeared widely as a lecturer and in 1972 began to conduct his own compositions.\n\nPenderecki has won numerous domestic and foreign prizes including the First Class State Award (1968, 1983), the Polish Composers’ Union Prize (1970), the Herder Prize (1977), the Sibelius Prize (1983), the Premio Lorenzo Magnifico (1985), the Israeli Karl Wolff Foundation Prize (1987), a Grammy Award (1988), a Grawemeyer Award (1992), and a UNESCO International Music Council Award (1993). He has honorary doctorates from universities in Rochester, Bordeaux, Leuven, Belgrade, Washington, Madrit, Poznań, Warsaw and Glasgow. He is an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London, Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Musikaliska Academien in Stockholm, Akademie der Kunste in Berlin, Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires, Academie Internationale de Philosophie et de I’ Art in Bern, Academie Internationale des Sciences, Belles-lettres et Arts in Bordeaux, and the Royal Academy of Music in Dublin. In 1990 he received the Great Cross of Merit of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, in 1993 the Order of Cultural Merit (Monaco), and in 1994 an Austrian honorary distinction For Achievements in Science and Arts. In 1993 he was decorated with the Commander’s Cross with the star of the Order of Polonia Restituta.\n\nPenderecki’s teaching career developed in Germany, the U.S. and Poland. He taught composition at the Volkwang Hochschule fur Music, Essen (from 1966 to 1968); in 1973-78 he lectured at Yale University in New Haven. In 1982-87 he was rector of the Academy of Music in Kraków, in 1987-1990 he served as the artistic director of the Cracow Philharmonic. Since his conductor’s debut with the London Symphony Orchestra (1973), he has performed with prominent symphony orchestras in the United States and Europe, and he is chief guest conductor of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Orchestra in Hamburg. Apart from his own works, his conducting repertoire covers the works of composers from various epochs, with a preference for 19th-century and early 20th-century compositions. In 1997 he published a book entitled “The Labyrinth of Time. Five Lectures at the End of the Century (Warsaw, “Presspublica”). In 1996 the performance of his piece Seven Gates of Jerusalem, commissioned by the city, commemorated the celebrations of “Jerusalem – 3000 Years.” in Israel.\n\nBrother Marsalis was initiated at the Delta Epsilon Chapter in 1965 and in 2015 he was named the Fraternity’s 24th “Man of Music” at the 55th National Convention.\n\nBorn on November 14, 1934, his formal music studies began at age eleven at the Xavier University junior school of music. After high school, Marsalis enrolled in Dillard University as a clarinet major. He graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Education. Marsalis spent the next year working as an assistant manager in his father’s motel business.\n\nThe following year, Marsalis joined the U.S. Marine Corps. While stationed in southern California he honed his pianist skills as a member of the Corps Four, a Marines jazz quartet that performed on television.\n\nReturning to New Orleans in 1966, he began freelancing on the local music scene. Between 1966 and 1974 Brother Marsalis would perform at the Playboy Club, Al Hirt nightclub, Lu and Charlie’s nightclub, Storyville nightclub Crazy Shirley’s as well as again enter the teaching profession, in 1967, as an adjunct professor of African American Music at Xavier University.\n\nIn 1986, Marsalis accepted a teaching position out of state. He became a Commonwealth Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, serving as coordinator of Jazz Studies two of his three years there. In 1989, he returned to New Orleans to become the first occupant and Director of the Coca-Cola Endowed Chair of Jazz Studies at the University of New Orleans.\n\nDuring his tenure at UNO, he helped colleague Charles Blancq develop a campus performance center called the Sand Bar. Marsalis would also develop a Jazz Orchestra, which he took, on the eve of his retirement, on a tour of Brazil. On August 10, 2001, Marsalis officially retired from the University of New Orleans after twelve years of dedicated service. His retirement was celebrated by a very rare performance of his sons Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis at the UNO arena.\n\nIn 2011, Brother Marsalis and his family were awarded the highest honor in Jazz, NEA Jazz Masters, the first group award ever distributed by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nGeorge Eastman was born in Waterville, New York, on July 12, 1854. His father, George W. Eastman, ran a business college in Rochester, New York; his mother, Maria Kilbourn, took care of young George and his two older sisters. His father died when he was seven, two years after the family moved to Rochester. His mother was forced to take in boarders to add to the family’s small income. George was educated in Rochester public schools but dropped out at age thirteen to work and help his mother. He advanced from messenger to bookkeeper in the Rochester Savings Bank by 1877. He was always careful with money, spending it only on his hobby, amateur photography. When photographic chemicals among his cameras and supplies ruined his packed clothes on a trip to Mackinac Island, he became disgusted with the wet-plate process of producing photographs.\n\nIn the 1870s American photography was still time-consuming, difficult, and expensive. Equipment included a huge camera, strong tripod (a three-legged stand), large plateholder, dark tent, chemicals, water container, and heavy glass plates. Eastman experimented using dry plates. He was the first American to contribute to the improvement of photographic methods by coating glass plates with gelatin, a gummy substance, and silver bromide, a chemical. In 1879 his coating machine was patented in England, and in 1880 he received an American patent for it. He sold his English patent and opened a shop to manufacture photographic plates in Rochester. To do away with glass plates, Eastman coated paper with gelatin and photographic chemicals. The developed film was stripped from the paper to make a negative. This film was rolled on spools. Eastman and William Walker created a lightweight roll holder that would fit any camera.\n\nIn 1888 Eastman designed a simple camera, the Kodak (a word created by Eastman; it has no meaning), which was easy to carry and made focusing and adjusting the light unnecessary. With a hundred-exposure roll of film, it sold for twenty-five dollars. After taking the pictures and sending the camera and ten dollars to the Rochester factory, the photographer received his prints and reloaded camera. Eastman’s slogan, “You press the button, we do the rest,” became well known. Eastman expected that photography would soon become more popular, and in 1892 he established the Eastman Kodak Company.\n\nEastman’s staff worked on other scientific problems as well as on photographic improvements. During World War I (1914–18) his laboratory helped build up America’s chemical industry to the point where it no longer depended on Germany. Eventually America became the world leader. Eastman cared about his employees; he was the first American businessman to grant workers shares in the profits made by the company. He also gave away large amounts of his huge fortune to the University of Rochester (especially the medical school and Eastman School of Music), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Hampton Institute, Tuskegee Institute, Rochester Dental Dispensary, and several European dental clinics.\n\nBeloved by audiences, lauded by critics and composers, and revered by singers, Johnson is known for crafting musical journeys that create deep connections between performers and listeners. The Wall Street Journal praised his ability to “find the emotional essence other performers often miss,” and Fanfare wrote that “Craig Hella Johnson has assembled and molded a first-rate choir to be respected as highly as the best we have had.” Distinguished composer John Corigliano wrote, “I believe that [Johnson] has understood my music in a way that I have never experienced before. He is a great musician who understands everything about the music he conducts.” Composer and collaborator Robert Kyr observed, “Craig’s attitude toward creating a community of artists who work together to interpret the score … goes beyond technical mastery into that emotional depth and spiritual life of the music.” Of Johnson’s performance of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, the San Antonio Express-News wrote: “Through all the amazing ebbs and flows of dynamics, the radiant balances, the seamless connection of episodes, the theatrically astute tempo relations, the unified structural arc, the music shone forth with organic naturalness. Nothing sounded fussed over. Everything just sounded right.”\n\nJohnson is also Music Director of the Cincinnati Vocal Arts Ensemble and conductor emeritus of the Victoria Bach Festival. He was Artistic Director of San Francisco-based Chanticleer (1998-1999) and has served as guest conductor with the Austin Symphony, San Antonio Symphony, and many others in Texas, the U.S., and abroad. As the Director of Choral Activities at the University of Texas at Austin from 1990-2001, Johnson led the graduate program in choral conducting. He remains an active educator, teaching nationally and internationally with professionals and students at conferences and universities. He is also a frequent speaker at regional and national conferences of the American Choral Directors Association. Craig Hella Johnson joined the faculty at Texas State as Artist in Residence in fall 2016 and continues to inspire his colleagues and students in innovative teaching and programming as Professor of Practice.\n\nA composer and arranger, Johnson works with G. Schirmer Publishing on the Craig Hella Johnson Choral Series, featuring specially selected composers as well as some of his original compositions and arrangements. His works are also published by Alliance Music Publications. A unique aspect of Johnson’s programming is his signature “collage” style: through-composed programs that marry music and poetry to blend sacred and secular, classical and contemporary, traditional and popular styles. In 2006 he was engaged to create a special peace-themed collage program for the North Central ACDA convention, and in 2007 by the famed St. Olaf Choir to create and conduct a collage program during a five-week residency. Craig’s first concert-length composition, Considering Matthew Shepard, was premiered in 2016 by Conspirare .\n\nA Minnesota native, Johnson studied at St. Olaf College, the Juilliard School, and the University of Illinois and earned his doctorate at Yale University. As the recipient of a National Arts Fellowship, Johnson studied with Helmuth Rilling at the International Bach Academy in Stuttgart, Germany. He has been a Texas resident since 1990.\n\nBorn December 15, 1911, in Wichita, Kansas, Kenton left the state with his family when he was six weeks old. Although he spent little time in Kansas, he still considered it his home state and Wichita his hometown. Many times he returned to Wichita to perform and he always received a hometown reception.\n\nKenton was unique in several ways. As an artist he was never satisfied to remain within the defined limits of the type of music he was performing. He was quoted in a newspaper interview as stating, “No art form lasts for an eternity. The moment of creation is the most potent time; then it diminishes until it finally has no meaning for the society around it.” With this as his philosophy of music, Kenton was a constant target of music critics that attacked his compositions because they did not conform to the status quo. He paid little attention to his critics or the rules he was supposed to follow.\n\nPerhaps the most unique part of Kenton’s personality was his innovativeness. In another newspaper interview he commented, “I have a problem with myself. I’m just not much for the past. When guys come around to talk about the good old days, I’m not much interested. I’m more concerned with what’s happening next.” His innovations included pioneering the form of jazz called, “Third Stream,” which is a blending of American jazz with European classical music. In the 1960s he experimented with a band featuring the mellophonium, which was a cross between a trumpet and a trombone. Later in the decade he established the Neophonic Orchestra, which was the first permanently established orchestra in the world devoted to contemporary music. He also made a habit of conducting clinics at universities. The clinics were his way of teaching young people his art and also ensuring that his brand of music would not die. Kenton died in California on August 25, 1979, but his music survives.\n\nAstronaut Winston E. Scott was initiated into the Epsilon Iota Chapter in 1970. Raised in Miami, Brother Scott’s largely segregated education provided little access to resources, but his own determination combined with the dedication of his teachers set him on an inspiring path of achievement. His journey to the stars is a testament to the power of perseverance and vision.\n\nScott was selected by NASA and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He served as a mission specialist on STS-72 in 1996 and STS-87 in 1997 and has logged a total of 24 days, 14 hours and 34 minutes in space, including 3 spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 26 minutes. During his time in space, he evaluated techniques utilized in the assembly of the International Space Station and several experiments such as the effects of zero gravity on physical functions of the human body.\n\nBefore joining NASA, Brother Scott earned a distinguished record of service as a naval aviator and officer. While on active duty he served as a fighter pilot, production test pilot, and as a research and development project pilot. He has accumulated more than 5,000 hours of flight time in more than 20 different aircraft.\n\nIn 2009 Brother Scott was named a Signature Sinfonian by Phi Mu Alpha. He is a published author, currently serving as the Senior Vice President for External Relations and Economic Development at Florida Institute of Technology. Scott also leads the Cosmic Jazz Ensemble as a trumpeter and directs the advanced jazz ensemble at the institute. As a musician, Navy veteran, and astronaut, Scott spends all the time he can inspiring the next generation to take on the mantel of discovering a bright new future for humanity.\n\nEllas McDaniel, who performed under the stage name “Bo Diddley,” was an American singer, guitarist, songwriter who shook the foundations of the blues on its way to what we know as rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nBrother McDaniel was a 1999 initiate of the Eta Omega Chapter at the University of Florida. Born as Ellas Otha Bates, he was adopted and raised by his mother’s cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose last name he took as his own. From a very early age, McDaniel took up a fascination with fast-paced, rhythmic music and started learning how to play guitar. He spent many of his early days as a young artist performing on street corners of Chicago with friends. This led him to join forces with musicians like Earl Hooker, Roosevelt Jackson, and Jody Williams.\n\nBy 1951, Brother McDaniel’s unique sound had landed him a regular spot at 708 Club on Chicago’s southside. Just four years later his first hit single would reach No. 2 on the Billboard singles chart. By the start of the 1960s, McDaniel had revolutionized rock ‘n’ roll with his music and his one of a kind persona. Although the market seemed to dwindle for his music in the United States, McDaniel quickly saw an emerging demand in Europe that paved the way for a tour of Britain performing with Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, and the Rolling Stones.\n\nWork in recording for McDaniel had practically dried up by the 1970s and he relocated to New Mexico where he served as a deputy sheriff for the town of Los Lunas for nearly three years. McDaniel continued to appear as a performer and public figure well into the new millennium. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame in 1998. The final album he recorded, “A Man Amongst Men,” was nominated for a Grammy in 1996.\n\nBrother McDaniel made his mark as a musical pioneer, one of many that changed the course of modern popular music as know it today. He will always be remembered as a musician of lasting historical importance.\n\nAlvin Batiste was initiated at the Mu Psi Chapter at Southern University in 1973. He was a composer, performer, and longtime educator at Southern University.\n\nInitially, Batiste had no real interest in playing the clarinet. It wasn’t until he heard Charlie Parker’s recording of “Now’s the Time” that he had any interest. After that moment, he was so inspired and began practicing regularly and applying himself in high school.\n\nFor a few years, after graduating from Booker T. Washington High School, Batiste picked up small time gigs backing local musicians and artists. Eventually, he began schooling at Southern University, where he studied classical music almost exclusively.\n\nWhile at Southern he had affectionately earned the name “Mozot” after being selected to play Wolfgang Mozart’s concerto for clarinet and orchestra with the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra. He had been the first African American student to chosen to play such a feature.\n\nSoon after graduating from Southern University, Batiste left for the city of Los Angeles in 1956. Two years later, he had caught a break and began touring with legendary musician Ray Charles. Perhaps one of the most memorable moments of his tour was the moment Batiste reportedly upstaged the “Genius of Soul” by playing a brilliant solo during the set. He was later chastised but took it in good nature. The incident led him to later compose the piece “Ray’s Segue.”\n\nMidway through the 1960s, Batiste was completing a master’s degree at Louisiana State University back in his home state. After joining the faculty at Southern University in 1969, he founded the Jazz Institute, which would later be renamed the Alvin Batiste Jazz Institute. He continued to teach there for seventeen years. Several musicians who studied under Batiste became icons in the world of jazz, including saxophonist Branford Marsalis and pianist Henry Butler, both Brothers in Phi Mu Alpha.\n\nAlvin Batiste’s later career focused towards the studio recording of several albums, continuous practice, and tours with the Batiste Jazz Institute’s band, the “Jazztronauts.” Beyond his talent, hit albums, fame, and countless awards, Batiste was given the title and award of “Signature Sinfonian” in 2007 before passing away at the age of 74. Alvin Batiste was admired by many for his caring nature and personal influence.\n\nFamed American jazz and blues pianist, Henry Butler, is quoted as saying the following about Batiste;\n\n“He was not only a teacher, he was my father away from home. He taught us about music, the history of music and the business of music.”\n\nGeorge Whitefield Chadwick was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on November 13, 1854. His mother died shortly after his birth. His father remarried and George quickly learned to become self-reliant. As a youngster, he received brief musical instruction from his brother. Both his father and brother participated in the great 1869 Peace Jubilee in Boston, as members of the 10,000-member chorus. That massive concert had a strong impact on the 15-year-old Chadwick. In 1871, he dropped out of high school in order to devote more time to the study of music. To pay for music lessons, he became a clerk in his father’s successful insurance business. One year later, he entered the New England Conservatory of Music as a special student and assumed the post of organist at a Congregational church.\n\nIn 1876, against his father’s wishes, Chadwick accepted a one-year position at Olivet College, Michigan. The same year, Theodore Presser enlisted him as a founding member of the Music Teachers National Association. At the inaugural meeting in Delaware, Ohio, Chadwick delivered a paper titled “Popular Music–Wherein Reform Is Necessary.”\n\nDetermined to have a broad music education, he traveled the next year to Europe. After studying for three months in Leipzig with Salomon Jadassohn, he entered the Leipzig Conservatory, where his success as a composer began. Chadwick’s String Quartet No. 2 in C Major and concert overture Rip Van Winkle received critical acclaim, the latter work winning the Conservatory’s award as the best composition of 1879. That autumn, he decided to gain additional training at the Königliche Musikschule in Munich, where he studied organ and composition with Joseph Rheinberger.\n\nChadwick returned to Boston in 1880, where one of his first private pupils was the young Horatio Parker. That year, the venerable Handel and Haydn Society invited him to conduct his Rip Van Winkle overture. During the next season, The Arlington Club performed his Margarita for men’s chorus, and the Apollo Club presented The Viking’s Last Voyage. In 1882, he accepted positions as organist at the Park Street Church and on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music. He assumed the directorship of the Conservatory in 1897, a position he held until 1930. Under his leadership, the conservatory modernized its curriculum and adopted a more European model. Chadwick instituted an opera workshop and a repertory orchestra. Orchestration and harmony courses were based on the study of concrete musical examples rather than abstract principles. His textbook, Harmony: A Course of Study (1897) experienced such success that it was reissued in 74 subsequent editions.\n\nHe devoted much time to administrative and teaching duties at the conservatory, composing mostly during the summers on Martha’s Vineyard. He developed and regularly conducted the conservatory’s orchestra and also served as director of the Springfield Festival (1890-99) and the Worcester Festival (1897-1901). He composed Phoenix expirans (1892) for the Springfield Festival and his largest score, the lyric drama Judith, for the Worcester Festival. In his later years, his verismo opera The Padrone was rejected by the Metropolitan Opera, but he experienced success with major choral and orchestral works at the Norfolk Festival. These include his Christmas oratorio Noël (1907-08) and a tribute to his Celtic heritage, the symphonic ballad Tam O’Shanter (1914-15).\n\nChadwick is often dubbed the dean of American composers because of his position as conservatory director, his textbooks, and his teaching. He directly influenced important turn-of-the-century composers such as Horatio Parker, Daniel Gregory Mason, Frederick Converse, and William Grant Still. He received honorary degrees from Yale (A.M., 1897) and Tufts (LL.D., 1905). He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1898) and the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1909). George Whitefield Chadwick died on April 4, 1931.\n\nHoratio William Parker was born in Auburndale, Massachusetts, on September 15, 1863. He received his earliest musical training from his mother, Isabella Jennings Parker, who instructed him in piano, organ, and music theory. He went on to study with pianist John Orth, theorist Stephen Emery, and composer George Chadwick, with whom Parker maintained a lifelong friendship. Although he began composing small pieces during this early period, Parker’s first major works were composed under the tutelage of Josef Rheinberger while he was attending the Hochschule für Musik in Munich from 1882 to 1885.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1893, Parker worked as organist and choirmaster at a series of churches in New York: St. Luke ‘s in Brooklyn, St. Andrew’s in Harlem, and the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan. His church music career in New York led to the composition and publication of a significant number of anthems and other sacred works. Parker’s increasing recognition as a prominent young composer culminated in 1893, when he received the National Conservatory prize in composition for his cantata Dream-King and His Love and the Church Choral Society of New York commission and performance of his oratorio, Hora novissima.\n\nParker left New York in the fall of 1893 to take a position at Boston’s Trinity Church. After only one year in Boston, he relocated to New Haven, Connecticut, to accept the Battell Professorship in music at Yale University. Parker’s new career direction, in a faculty position that he would hold through the end of his life, established him as a leading educator of young American composers. His students at Yale included Charles Ives, Seth Bingham, Quincy Porter, and Roger Sessions. Parker became dean of the School of Music at Yale University in 1904.\n\nThe popularity of Parker’s choral compositions extended beyond the United States. In 1899, Parker conducted a performance of Hora novissima at the Three Choirs Festival in Worcester, England, becoming the first American composer to participate in the prestigious event. A major new commission, The Wanderer’s Psalm, and other British festival performances of his works occurred in the years to follow. On June 10, 1902, Parker was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree from Cambridge University.\n\nIn addition to teaching and composing, Parker continued to cultivate his career as a choral and orchestral conductor. He was the principal conductor of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra from 1895 to 1918 and the director of the Derby Choral Club from 1904 until his death in 1919. In 1903, Parker founded the New Haven Oratorio Society, and in 1907 he became the director of Philadelphia’s Orpheus Club male chorus and its sister group, the Eurydice Chorus.\n\nArthur Foote was born in 1853 in Salem, Massachusetts, and grew up in Boston. After beginning his music education at age twelve, he studied harmony at the New England Conservatory before entering Harvard College in 1870. There he studied counterpoint and fugue with John Knowles Paine. He also led the Harvard Glee Club (1872-74), where he gained practical experience in working with voices. One year after graduating, Foote returned to Harvard to earn a Master of Arts degree in music, the first granted by an American university.\n\nWhile working on his master’s degree, Foote studied organ with B. J. Lang, one of the leading musical figures in Boston and the city’s foremost choral conductor. Lang led the Apollo Club and Cecilia Society in Boston premieres of new works by Berlioz, Wagner, and others. He also championed choral works by American composers and was instrumental in convincing Foote to pursue a musical career. In 1876, Foote accepted the post of organist at the Church of the Disciples. Two years later he moved to the First Unitarian Church, where he served as organist for more than thirty years. During his tenure there, he edited two Unitarian hymnals in 1890 and 1896. He was one of the founders of the American Guild of Organists in 1896 and served as national president from 1909 to 1912.\n\nDuring his lifetime, his compositions in the area of chamber music brought him most acclaim, including performances at the World Exposition of 1893. Several of his orchestral compositions were premiered by the Boston Symphony. The Suite in E Major, op. 63, was championed by Serge Koussevitzky and achieved great popularity. His Four Character Pieces after the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, op. 48, received praise for its colorful orchestration.\n\nFoote’s list of vocal compositions includes one hundred songs, fifty-two part-songs, and thirty-five anthems. He wrote three choral-orchestral works on texts of H. W. Longfellow: The Farewell of Hiawatha (1885), The Wreck of the Hesperus (1888), and The Skeleton in Armor (1891). After the first performance of The Farewell of Hiawatha, led by Foote’s mentor B. J. Lang, the composer sent the score to composer/conductor Dudley Buck in hopes of gaining a performance by Buck’s groups in Brooklyn. Buck answered that he was very interested in programming American works, but he offered one slight criticism: “Don’t write too high continuously for American tenors. It is not the compass per se, — that we have, but the sustaining of reiterated high tones as compared with German voices.”[1] In his anthem writing, on the other hand, Foote intentionally tried to write pieces that were accessible to the congregation and easy for the singers. He was perplexed, therefore, that his most popular anthem, Still, Still with Thee, was one of his most difficult.\n\nRochester native Chuck Mangione was born into a large, music-loving family.\n\nChuck has often recalled that his father, a tremendous jazz fan, invited touring musicians who were performing in Rochester home for a good Italian dinner and some wine. While he was still a boy, Chuck had met a Who’s Who of 1950s jazz royalty, including such great artists as Art Blakey, Sarah Vaughan, and the man he claimed as a “musical father,” Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nWith so much great music in his childhood, it is no surprise that Chuck attended the Eastman School of Music, playing trumpet and graduating in 1963 with a Bachelor’s degree in music education. BY that time he had recorded several albums with pianist brother Gap, performing as The Jazz Brothers.\n\nIn 1968, Chuck Mangione returned to Eastman, directing the Eastman Jazz Ensemble until 1972 and helping to expand the School’s jazz programs. In 1970, he also presented the famous Friends and Love concert with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, which was recorded for Mercury Records and shown numerous times on PBS. When Chuck left Eastman, he was well on his way to “household name” status as a composer, arranger, flugelhorn player, and bandleader.\n\nWithin the next ten years, Chuck had won two Grammy awards and an Emmy, and his album Feels So Good became one of the most successful jazz albums ever produced. An estimated 90,000,000 people heard Chuck perform at the closing ceremonies of the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. An honorary doctorate from the University of Rochester in 1985 put Chuck in the company of such American musical icons as Aaron Copland, Isaac Stern, and Rudolf Serkin. In May 2007, Chuck received Eastman’s Alumni Achievement Award at a concert recreating Friends and Love.\n\nNewsweek began a profile of him with the words: “Chuck Mangione makes jazz that sounds the way he looks – ingenious, upbeat, and instantly likeable.” For his own part, Chuck has said, “If you’re honest and play with love, people will sit down and listen … My music is the sum of all I have experienced.”\n\nHeralded as a “living legend” by the African Diaspora Sacred Music and Musicians Program, Brother André Thomas has conducted several ensembles worldwide. He continues to inspire countless people to a greater love of the arts through personal philosophy and independent musical growth.\n\nThomas was initiated into the Zeta Phi Chapter at Friends University in 1971. From an early age, he grew up listening to his mother sing in church, and this is where his fascination with music would begin. While he had taken some piano lessons from members of the church, Thomas was predominantly self-taught in his early years. It wasn’t until high school that he would take piano lessons formally. Thomas was attracted by the energy and passion of the choral groups of Friends University in Wichita, Kansas, where he began his collegiate education. After a few years of teaching vocal music in public school systems, Brother Thomas pursued a master’s degree in piano performance at Northwestern. He later earned his doctorate under the guidance and mentorship of Harold A. Decker (Gamma Sigma, Wichita State University, 1947). Decker was responsible for creating the first Doctor of Musical Arts program in choral music in the United States. It was Decker’s guidance, Thomas recalls, that taught him how to run a graduate program where the welfare and development of the student is the highest priority.\n\nThroughout his career, Brother Thomas has been known as a conductor, composer, professor, and author. He was named an Owen F. Sellers Professor of Music by Florida State University and appointed recently as Professor of Choral Conducting and Interim conductor of the Yale Camerata for 2020-2021. Thomas has received several awards for his service, including the Robert Shaw Award in 2017, the American Choral Directors Association’s highest honor. As an author, Thomas is renowned for his book, “Way Over in Beulah Lan’,” a work dedicated to understanding the Negro Spiritual. The first of the book’s two sections includes an exploration of the beginnings of the spiritual, its role in society, and its transition into art music. The second section is a study of performing the spiritual, exploring text, diction, rhythm, and tempo.\n\nMusic all together is a fusing of mind, body, and spirit. Music enables people to cope with issues that arise out of the human condition, and Brother Thomas believes that music aids in the exploration of the emotions that make us human. Most importantly, he endorses the idea that music is cathartic, and that it can be used to bring people together from diverse racial, cultural, social, and economic backgrounds. For Thomas, this is the real power of music.\n\nDr. Sigmund Spaeth was a man who worked to promote the idea that “music should not be limited to people of talent” but rather that music should be enjoyed by everyone, listeners, and performers alike.\n\nBrother Spaeth was a charter member of the Iota Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha at Northwestern University in 1910. His name as a composer and musicologist was interwoven with American music for several decades from the early 1920s through the late 1940s. After attending Haverford College (where he would compose the alma mater) he earned a doctorate degree from Princeton University. Spaeth was a well-known music critic on several newspapers including the “New York Times” and “The Boston Evening Transcript.” He would also compose music for the movies “Show Boat” and “The Trespasser.”\n\nSpaeth was the author of several books such as “A History of Popular Music in America” and “The Common Sense of Music.” These works helped show the ties between popular songs of the time and old American folk songs. His vast knowledge of musical heritages led to the premiere of his NBC programs “Keys to Happiness” and “The Tune Detective.” On many occasions, he was sought out as an expert witness in the courtroom testifying against musical plagiarism. As a passionate supporter of barbershop quartet singing, Spaeth would spend much time outside of his profession organizing musical groups for the blind and arranging to have records sent to servicemen overseas.\n\nIn 1958, Brother Spaeth was named Phi Mu Alpha’s 4th “Man of Music” at the 35th National Convention for his contributions to American art and culture as well as his study of the origins of American popular music.\n\nMichael Leckrone served as the longtime Director of the Marching Band and Director of Bands at the University of Wisconsin. A native of Indiana, Brother Leckrone received his Bachelor and Master of Music degrees from Butler University in Indianapolis and has continued his studies at the doctoral level at Indiana University. Before coming to Wisconsin he taught at his alma mater, where he developed one of the finest marching bands in the Midwest. He is in constant demand as a clinician, guest conductor and adjudicator for concert and marching bands throughout the United States and Canada, and his experience also includes considerable professional work as an arranger, composer, and performer.\n\nLeckrone holds memberships in numerous professional organizations, as well as such honorary fraternities as Kappa Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Lambda, Phi Kappa Phi, and Phi Beta Mu. He is a 30-year member of ASCAP and has been elected to the American Bandmasters Association. In 1970 he was cited as an “Outstanding Educator of America” by the Outstanding Americans Foundation, in 1973 was awarded the “Outstanding Bandmaster Award” by the Wisconsin Chapter of Phi Beta Mu, and in 1986 was presented with a Citation of Excellence by the National Band Association. He is a recipient of the “Pat O’Dea Award,” the “Blue Line Club Distinguished Service Award,” the “Badger Basketball Boosters Distinguished Service Award,” the UW Alumni Club “Distinguished Faculty Award,” the Wisconsin Newspaper Writers “Special Edition Award,” and the Wisconsin Sports Hall of Fame “Good Guy” award. Brother Leckrone was recently inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame as well as the Wisconsin Football Hall of Fame and has been commissioned a “Kentucky Colonel” by the Governor of Kentucky. He has been honored as “Father of the Year” by the American Diabetes Association; has been cited a “Badger Legend” by the Governor of Wisconsin and was named one of 10 Madison Musical Legends by Madison Magazine as well as designated one of the Wisconsin State Journal’s “Sesquicentennial People of Note,” and was recently selected to be an honorary member of the National “W” Club. The University of Wisconsin has also honored him with an appointment to a prestigious “John Bascom Professorship.” In 2007 he was presented with a “Lifetime Achievement Award” by the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music, (this was only the second time this preeminent award had been conferred), and in 2010 the Wisconsin State Historical Society presented him with the “Spencer Tracy Award for Distinction in the Performing Arts”, and in 2013 the Madison Area Music Association named him the recipient of the Michael St. John Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nMicheal has composed or arranged music for numerous high school and university bands, and over 200 of his arrangements and compositions for marching band and concert band have been published. He is also the author of two texts for use by marching band directors, a handbook for band arranging and a text dealing with popular music in the United States. Mr. Leckrone is now entering his 50th year as director of the Wisconsin Band.\n\nHenry Butler was initiated into the Mu Psi Chapter at Southern University in 1969. Butler’s music is a cornerstone of the New Orleans sound and was described by Jon Pareles of the New York Times as “encyclopedic, precise, and wild.” Although Butler would eventually resettle in Brooklyn during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the city of New Orleans always stayed close to his heart.\n\nBrother Butler was blinded by glaucoma at a very early age and began schooling at the Louisiana State School for the Blind (now the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired) studying classical music. However, Butler always held great interest in the “New Orleans Guys” whom he would hear on the radio. He would later attend Southern University where he was mentored by clarinet legend Alvin Batiste (Mu Psi) and earned a bachelor’s degree in voice with a minor in piano.\n\nAfter earning a master’s degree in music from Michigan State University Brother Butler returned to Louisiana and quickly began making a name for himself. He became known for his technique and his ability to play in many styles of music. Butler was often seen playing with up to four different groups at the same time featured as a soloist and a sideman. He would also record several albums from 1986 to 2014.\n\nButler viewed himself as a teacher and he served as an associate professor at Eastern Illinois University from 1990 to 1996. Three years into teaching at the university he organized his first workshop for blind/visually impaired teens. He would continue to hold the workshop at different locations across the country annually until 2003. Brother Butler saw himself as always teaching but also, always learning – musically and personally as he said, “It is what we are constantly doing on this journey here, becoming more of who we can be.”\n\nHeeeeere’s Johnny!” That lead-in, followed by a big band trumpet blast, was the landmark of late night television for three decades. The ‘Johnny’ was Johnny Carson, the announcer was Ed McMahon and the bandleader was Doc Severinsen. Beginning in October 1962, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson ruled the night air for thirty years. On May 22, 1992, it came to an end…\n\nWithin a week of the final telecast, Doc Severinsen and His Big Band were on the road, and to this day, audiences across America love and respect Doc and his big band, not just because he shared their living room with them for so many years, but because of Doc’s love of the Big Band repertoire. His musicianship keeps this iconic American music fresh to this day. Their repertoire includes Ellington and Basie standards, pop, jazz, ballads, big band classics and, of course, The Tonight Show theme. Severinsen can still blow hard with his horn, and hit the high notes, a result of his continued commitment to the practice studio and the refinement of his craft. But as a band leader, Doc continues to surround himself with the best in the business, and he’s only too happy to give them a turn in the spotlight.\n\nA Grammy award winner, Doc has made more than 30 albums–from big band to jazz-fusion to classical. Two critically acclaimed Telarc CDs with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra showcase his multifaceted talents from Bach to ballads. The Very Best of Doc Severinsen reprises fifteen of Doc’s signature pieces. His other recordings include Unforgettably Doc with the Cincinnati Pops on Telarc, and the Grammy nominated Once More With Feeling on Amherst. He received a Grammy Award for “Best Jazz instrumental Performance – Big Band” for his recording of Doc Severinsen and The Tonight Show Band-Volume I.\n\nSeverinsen’s accomplishments began in his hometown of Arlington, Oregon, population: 600. Carl H Severinsen was born on July 7th, 1927, and was nicknamed “Little Doc” after his father, Dr. Carl Severinsen a dentist. Little Doc had originally wanted to play the trombone. But Doc Sr., a gifted amateur violinist, urged him to follow in his father’s footsteps. The Doc Jr. insisted on the trombone, which turned out to be unavailable in tiny Arlington’s music store. And so, a trumpet it would be. A week later, with the help of his father and a manual of instructions, the seven-year-old was so good that he was invited to join the high school band. At the age of twelve, Little Doc won the Music Educator’s National Contest and, while still in high school, was hired to go on the road with the famous Ted Fio Rito Orchestra. However, his stay with the group was cut short by the draft. He served in the Army during World War II and following his discharge, landed a spot with the Charlie Barnett Band. When this band broke up, Severinsen toured with the Tommy Dorsey, then, the Benny Goodman bands in the late 40’s.\n\nAfter his days with Barnett and Dorsey, Doc arrived in New York City in 1949 to become a staff musician for NBC. After years of playing with NBC’s many studio bands, Doc was invited to play a gig in the highly respected Tonight Show Band. The band leader at the time, Skitch Henderson, asked him to join that band in 1962 in the first trumpet chair. Five years later, Doc became the Music Director for The Tonight Show and the rest is history. His loyalty to Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon never faltered, and the warm camaraderie between the three was an enormous part of the show’s success. When Johnny decided to retire from The Tonight Show, Doc and Ed said their goodbyes as well. Of course, free from the nightly grind of the TV studio, Doc Severinsen had far more time to expand his musical horizons and continues to keep an extensive touring schedule.\n\nToday, Doc has not lost his flair for the outrageous fashion statement or his trademark wit. But his gregarious nature has never interfered with the fact that he has been one of the greatest trumpeters and musicians of the last 60 years, respected in the worlds of classical music, jazz, big band, and now even world music. In the end, Doc Severinsen has transcended his celebrity, and rejoiced in his remarkable ability to simply play his trumpet as well as he can. Which has proven to be good enough for the millions of people who count themselves his fans.\n\nA Spanish guitarist and composer, Carlos Montoya made a lasting contribution to music between the 20s and 50s. He introduced the flamenco style of music as a serious form of guitar music. Traditionally flamenco music was used to accompany gypsy folk dancers and singers but Carlos Montoya changed it into a main genre of music.\n\nCarlos Montoya was born into a gypsy family in Spain. His interest in music and the guitar began at an early age. He began studying the guitar with his mother and a neighboring barber, eventually learning from Pepe el Barbero, a guitarist and teacher. Not only was he interested in playing the guitar, Carlos Montoya wanted to learn the history of flamenco music. Flamenco music came out of the Moorish invasion of Spain. His uncle, Ramon Montoya, was a successful flamenco guitarist also. Carlos Montoya started playing professionally at the age of 14, playing for singers and dancers at the cafes in Madrid. Two of the dancers he most often played for were La Teresina and La Argentina.\n\nWanting to broaden his musical career, Carlos Montoya began touring in the 20s and 30s. His tours included performances in Europe, Asia and North America. He accompanied several performers including La Argentina again. He had finally made a name for himself as a flamenco guitarist.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in the 1940s, Carlos Montoya was on tour in the United States with dancer La Argentinita. During the war he decided to settle in New York City and eventually became a United States citizen. In 1945 La Argentinita died but Carlos Montoya toured on his own, opening his repertoire to include not only flamenco but also blues, jazz and folk music.\n\nHis career took a different turn in 1948 when he began touring with symphonies and orchestras and performing his own guitar recitals. Carlos Montoya became the first flamenco guitarist to tour the world with symphonies and orchestras. His appearances did not stop there, he performed on television and gave several solo recitals. During his touring he recorded more than 40 albums, some with symphonies and orchestras. His albums include Flamenco Guitar and The Art of Flamenco. One of the most notable is Suite flamenco, a concerto he performed with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1966.\n\nCarlos Montoya made a very important contribution to flamenco music, transforming it from a dance accompaniment to a style of its own. With his own style, he adapted it to other genres of music, all along making himself an international star.\n\nHenry Ziegler Steinway is the great-grandson of Henry Engelhard Steinway who founded Steinway & Sons, which handcrafts, what many consider to be, the world’s finest pianos.\n\nBorn on August 23, 1915 in a New York City apartment that replaced the original Steinway factory, Steinway grew up surrounded by pianos and the famous artists who performed on them. Such artists included Alexander Brailowsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Arthur Rubenstein, among many others.\n\nSteinway’s father, Theodore, never pressured his six children to enter the family business. That may explain why the younger Steinway graduated from Harvard University with a degree in history, not music or business administration. Of course, even a business degree from Harvard probably would not have spared him from his apprenticeship as a laborer in the Steinway factory yard, when he ultimately joined the company in 1937. To this day, Steinway says working with skilled workers taught him more about the piano business and why company craftsmen take more than a year to create Steinway pianos, than years of extra study would have accomplished.\n\nFollowing three years of military service during World War II, Steinway returned to the family business as factory manager. He became the director of the company in 1947 and was named vice president that same year. By 1955, he was appointed company president.\n\nLike his predecessors, Steinway made many contributions to Steinway & Sons during his years at the helm of the company. Manufacturing operations at Steinway’s Long Island City facility were renovated during his watch, and a number of improvements to the piano manufacturing process also were credited to him.\n\nHenry remained at the head of Steinway & Sons until 1977, after the company was purchased by CBS. He then served with the company as its chairman until his retirement in 1980. Since then, he has remained active as a consultant for the firm.\n\nA strong advocate of music education, Steinway is the founding president of the Museum of Making Music, an organization that curates public exhibits relating to the history of American popular music. He is the past director of the American Music Conference and recipient of the Prix de Martell for Lifetime Contributions to the World of Classical Music. Other positions and honors include benefactor to the International Piano Archives at the University of Maryland and recipient of the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nWilliam James “Count” Basie was a 1970 initiate of the Mu Nu Chapter at Louisiana Tech University. Basie established swing as a predominant music style and is regarded as one of the greatest bandleaders of all time alongside Duke Ellington (Rho Upsilon). His big-band sound and unique style changed the jazz landscape and shaped mid-20th-century popular music.\n\nBrother Basie grew up in Red Bank, New Jersey and was fascinated with music from an early age. He was noted for an “incredible ear” as he was able to pluck out any melody he heard on the piano. Basie spent his early years accompanying the vaudeville touring circuit until his group was disbanded leaving him stranded in Kansas City, Missouri. Making the best of a bad situation, Basie stayed in Kansas City and joined up with Walter Page’s “Blue Devils” in 1928.\n\nThe Blue Devils were Basie’s first time experiencing the big-band sound and he wanted more. When Basie formed his own band called the “Barons of Rhythm” they became regulars at the Reno Club. It was while playing a live broadcast at the Reno Club that Basie was dubbed “Count” Basie by a radio announcer. From here on out the Count would skyrocket to fame, eventually releasing their first album under a new name, “The Count Basie Orchestra.”\n\nThrough several hit recordings like One O’Clock Jump and April in Paris, Basie and his orchestra redefined big-band sound through the 1930s and in the 1940s. As the 50s emerged, the orchestra featured several great artists in recordings and concerts that brought the group newfound popularity. This trend continued well into the 1970s and many of Basie’s albums became Grammy Award winners or nominees.\n\nCount Basie continued to front his legendary big band up until his death in 1984. The following year his autobiography, Good Morning Blues, was published as recounted by Basie to historian Albert Murray.\n\nSamuel Adler was born March 4, 1928, in Mannheim, Germany and came to the United States in 1939. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in May 2001, and then inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in October 2008. In 2018he was award the Bundesverdienstkreuz (first class), the highest civilian award given by the German government .\n\nHe is the composer of over 400 published works, including 5 operas, 6 symphonies, 17 concerti, 8 string quartets, 5 oratorios and many other orchestral, band, chamber and choral works and songs, which have been performed all over the world. He is the author of four books, Choral Conducting (Holt Reinhart and Winston 1971, second edition Schirmer Books 1985), Sight Singing (W.W. Norton 1979, 1997), and The Study of Orchestration (W.W. Norton 1982, 1989, 2001), and the autobiographical Building Bridges With Music (Pendragon Press 2017). He has also contributed numerous articles to major magazines and books published in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nAdler was educated at Boston University and Harvard University, and holds honorary doctorates from Southern Methodist University, Wake Forest University, St. Mary’s Notre-Dame and the St. Louis Conservatory. His major teachers were: in composition, Herbert Fromm, Walter Piston, Randall Thompson, Paul Hindemith and Aaron Copland; in conducting, Serge Koussevitzky.\n\nHe is Professor-emeritus at the Eastman School of Music where he taught from 1966 to 1995 and served as chair of the composition department from 1974 until his retirement. Before going to Eastman, Adler served as professor of composition at the University of North Texas (1957-1977), Music Director at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, Texas (1953-1966), and instructor of Fine Arts at the Hockaday School in Dallas, Texas (1955-1966). From 1954 to 1958 he was music director of the Dallas Lyric Theater and the Dallas Chorale. From 1997 to 2017 he was a member of the composition faculty at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City where he was awarded the 2009-10 William Schuman Scholars Chair. Adler has given master classes and workshops at over 300 universities worldwide, and in the summers has taught at major music festivals such as Tanglewood, Aspen, Brevard, Bowdoin, as well as others in France, Germany, Israel, Spain, Austria, Poland, South America and Korea.\n\nHis works have been performed lately by the Berlin Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Mannheim National Theater Orchestra; the orchestras of Beijing, Chendu, Frankfurt (Oder), among others.\n\nAdler has received commissions from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, the Koussevitzky Foundation, the Barlow Foundation, the City of Jerusalem, the Welsh Arts Council and many others.\n\nAdler has appeared as conductor with many major symphony orchestras, both in the U.S. and abroad. His compositions are published by Theodore Presser Company, Oxford University Press, G. Schirmer, Carl Fischer, E.C. Schirmer, Peters Edition, Ludwig-Kalmus Music Masters, Southern Music Publishers, Transcontinental Music Publishers, and Leupold Music. Recordings of his works have been done on Linn, Naxos, RCA, Gasparo, Albany, CRI, Crystal, Parma and Vanguard.\n\nDr. Cedric Adderley was initiated into the Iota Beta Chapter at North Carolina A & T State University in 1994 while holding the position of Assistant Director of Bands. In the years since then, he has seen success and personal fulfillment both on and off the stage as a composer, conductor, and educator. He currently serves as the fourth president of the South Carolina Governor’s School for the Arts and Humanities where he has been since 2015.\n\nA native of South Carolina, Brother Adderley began a career in education in the South Carolina Public Schools, teaching both instrumental and choral music. In his nearly thirty years of teaching, both in public schools and at the university level, Dr. Adderley has helped restructure music programs and academic units to increase enrollment, improved the performance of students, and brought stability back to music programs.\n\nOn top of this success as an educator and educational reformer, Adderley has composed several pieces for band and orchestra. Two compositions of note, Symphony no.1 and Suite for Young Voices, earned him the Detroit Symphony Orchestra’s Annual Composer Award and the Composer of the Year Award by the South Carolina Music Teachers Association respectively. As a trumpeter and vocalist, Adderley has played with names like Ray Charles, Olivia Newton-John, and Louie Bellson as well as other touring variety bands.\n\nIn his most recent years, Brother Adderley has become a community leader and has taken a firm front-line stand in his role at South Carolina Governor’s School. He has committed himself to make a real change in his home state and to realize the true potential of the school he leads. From establishing a strong mission whose purpose is to serve all students and teachers of South Carolina, continually sending messages of hope and outreach, and keeping an eye toward the future; Brother Adderley continues to prove that with a strong foundation and a dash of hope, we can truly make a difference together.\n\nFrancois Clemmons was a 1968 initiate of the Alpha Omega Chapter at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nBrother Clemmons has sung professionally in the Metropolitan Opera Studio and was awarded a GRAMMY for his 1973 recording as Sportin’ Life in George Gershwin’s Porgy & Bess. However, Clemmons is perhaps best known for his appearances as Officer Clemmons on the PBS television series Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nFrancois Clemmons was born in Birmingham, Alabama and grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. Most of his early singing experience he owes to his mother who passed down traditional spirituals to him as a child in her kitchen. As a young adult, Clemmons attended Oberlin College where he earned his Bachelor of Music degree. He would eventually attend Carnegie Mellon University to obtain a Master of Fine Arts and receive an honorary doctorate degree from Middlebury College.\n\nIn 1968, while performing with a church choir in the Pittsburgh-area, Clemmons was approached by a man who was impressed by his singing. The man wanted to offer Clemmons a spot on his television show. That man was Fred McFeely Rogers (Xi Psi). After an initial uneasy feeling about joining the cast, Brother Clemmons accepted, not knowing the experience would profoundly impact his life. For the next 25 years, Clemmons appeared on Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood as policeman Officer Clemmons, forever grateful for Rogers’ fatherly guidance.\n\nBrother Clemmons spent many years singing opera professionally but in the late 1980s, he found a renewed passion for the spirituals his mother sang to him in his childhood. This renewed passion led him to create “The Harlem Spiritual Ensemble,” an ensemble dedicated to preserving the American Negro Spiritual. In 1995 Clemmons published a volume of choral arrangements of spirituals titled Songs for Today as part of his growing commitment to the art form’s preservation. In 2013, Francois Clemmons retired from Middlebury College after 16 years of teaching.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff was born near Lake Ilmen in the Novgorod district of Russia in 1873. He began learning the piano at the age of four, and at nineteen, he graduated from Moscow Conservatory, winning a gold medal for his one-act opera “Aleko.” His fame and popularity, both as composer and concert pianist, were launched by two compositions. The “Prelude in C-sharp Minor,” played for the first time in public on September 26, 1892, and his “Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor,” which had its first performance in Moscow on October 27, 1901.\n\nIn his youth, Rachmaninoff was subject to emotional crises over the success or failure of his works and his personal relationships. Self-doubt and uncertainty carried him into deep depressions, one of the most severe of which followed the failure of the first performance of his “Symphony No. 1 in D Minor” in March 1897. The symphony was poorly performed, and critics condemned it.\n\nIn 1901, his “Piano Concerto No. 2,” paved the way for future success. The piece was dedicated to the hypnotherapist Nikolay Dahl who helped him recover from his depression. The piece had been enthusiastically received and earned him a Glinka Award, the first of five awarded to him throughout his life.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff began working his way into the west in the face of political turmoil within Russia. He first toured America in 1909-1910, and eventually emigrated after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Two years later, on April 22, 1919, the Alpha Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia invited Rachmaninoff to membership, and he accepted the same day.\n\nA towering virtuoso with a near-photographic memory, Rachmaninoff was, in effect, the final expression of Romantic tradition – a melodist, still writing in an era of ever-evolving change and experimentation. A 1936 review in “The New York Times” praised the performance of Rachmaninoff’s new “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini” at Carnegie Hall with Stokowski and the Philly Orchestra: “To hear Mr. Rachmaninoff interpret the piano part is to listen to an amazing exhibition of imagination and commanding musicianship.”\n\nDaryl Davis was a 1978 initiate of the Zeta Iota Chapter at Howard University and is a renowned blues musician. Since the early 1980s, he has been an author, actor, and race relations activist. Brother Davis has based his engagement on a sincere belief in the statement “When two enemies are talking, they’re not fighting.”\n\nBrother Davis was born in Chicago, Illinois and absorbed the music and talents of blues musicians in the area during his early years. He attended Howard University and earned a bachelor’s degree in music by 1980. While at Howard, Davis was mentored by pianists Pinetop Perkins and Johnnie Johnson, who would both claim him as their godson, praising his mastery of the piano. Davis released several recording albums and has been featured on many others, including Cephas & Wiggins’ Grammy-nominated album Flip, Flop & Fly.\n\nIn 1983, Davis was approached by a man who was very impressed with his performance during a gig in Frederick, Maryland. Throughout their conversation, the man admitted that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The two men continued their conversation and would eventually become friends. The friendship would lead Davis down a path that would provide him with opportunities never imagined before. He began interviewing Klan members in hopes of writing a book, asking them one simple question, ‘Why do you hate me when you know nothing about me?’ Davis’ approach was to tear down racial barriers and show that by finding commonalities with your fellow man you can form true bonds of friendship. Through his book, lecturers, and ideals, Davis began to spread a message that ultimately led hundreds of Klansmen to denounce the group. Davis remains friends with many of these members today.\n\nBrother Davis has received numerous awards and overwhelming recognition for his work as an artist and activist. He has received the Elliott-Black Award, the MLK Award, and the Bridge Builder Award among many others. In 2016, he was the subject of the documentary film Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America. The film debuted on PBS and has received great acclaim worldwide. Today, Davis continues to deliver impassioned lectures, leaving an audience “feeling empowered to confront their own prejudices and overcome their fears.”\n\nThrough the power of his music and a chance encounter, Brother Davis continued a movement that was begun by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Through goodwill and nonviolence, he transformed hate into mutual helpfulness and friendship.\n\nEdward Kennedy Ellington, known to all as “Duke” Ellington, was and still is one of the most influential figures in jazz. His music created a distinct sound that transcends boundaries, joins generations, and creates the unique theme that is, as Ellington put it, “American Music.”\n\nDuke Ellington was initiated as an honorary member of the Rho Upsilon Chapter at Temple University in 1969. He had grown up in Washington, D.C., beginning piano lessons at the age of seven. However, it wasn’t until high school that he truly began studying the arts in earnest and in 1923 he moved to New York City to pursue them professionally. His first group, “The Duke’s Serenaders” took him all over Washington, D.C., and Virginia. He would soon become a regular performer at the storied “Cotton Club” in Harlem.\n\nIn 1927, Ellington auditioned for a spot as the premier entertainer at the club. He continued to play and lead his orchestra in regular appearances until 1931. The praise he received on European tours during the Depression Era began to influence him greatly as he composed longer, more artistically rich works. These extended pieces were in line with Ellington’s long-term aim to extend the typical jazz form. Although these innovations were not well received originally, audiences grew to appreciate them throughout the 1940s until Brother Ellington became universally regarded as “the king of the three-minute masterpiece.”\n\nThe 1950s were particularly hard on Ellington’s career, as his music was received by many as “old-fashioned.” His appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival of 1956, however, propelled Ellington once more into international headlines and onto the cover of Time Magazine. The festival performance presented Ellington and his band to a whole new generation of fans that could not get enough of The Duke.\n\nEllington was awarded both the President’s Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to American culture and art. France also bestowed him with the Legion of Honor, the country’s highest civilian honor. When asked what inspired him to write, Ellington replied, “My men and my race are the inspiration of my work. I try to catch the character and mood and feeling of my people.”\n\nIn his long career, which spanned six decades and four cities, Robert Shaw transformed choral conducting into an art and nearly single-handedly raised its standards to a new level. For more than half a century he set the standard of excellence for choral music, enjoying a status of patriarch of vocal musical interpretation in the USA.\n\nRobert (Lawson) Shaw came from a clerical family. His father and grandfather were ministers. More importantly, perhaps, his mother sang in church choirs. In school, his serious interests were in philosophy, literature, and religion, but at Pomona College he did join the glee club. Then, in a chain of events right out of a Warner Brothers backstage musical, Shaw was asked to take over the choir for an ailing faculty leader the same year that Fred Waring happened to be making a film on the campus. Waring was impressed, asked him to go to New York to develop a glee club for him, and a star conductor was born.\n\nRobert Shaw’s first major honor came as early as 1943 from the National Association of Composers and Conductors which cited him as “America’s greatest choral conductor.”\n\nFour decades ago, the great – and not easily pleased – Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini was conducting L.v. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with his NBC Symphony Orchestra. After hearing the chorus, which had been prepared by Robert Shaw, perform the glorious choral movement that ends the symphony, Arturo Toscanini turned to his players and said, “In Robert Shaw I have at last found the maestro I have been looking for.”\n\nWith the founding of the Robert Shaw Chorale in New York in 1948, which Robert Shaw was to conduct for another 20 years, his fame and influence in the field became second to none in the world, leading the group on extensive tours throughout Europe, the Soviet Union, Latin America, and the Middle East under the auspices of the State Department. For this esteemed Robert Shaw Chorale, he commissioned pieces from the leading composers of the day: Béla Bartók, Darius Milhaud, Benjamin Britten, and Aaron Copland.\n\nRobert Shaw also served as music director of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra until he was recruited by George Szell to conduct the choral section of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. He served under Szell for 11 years, during which time he shaped the Cleveland chorus.\n\nIn 1967 Robert Shaw accepted the directorship of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and saw it grow from a local band of a part-time amateur symphony of 60 musicians to a fine major-league orchestra (when he retired in 1988, the orchestra comprised 93 professional players), establishing a magnificent choral adjunct and leading the combined forces in many definitive recordings of the symphonic-choral music literature. During his 21 years in Atlanta, he conducted both the regular orchestra and the chorus. The recordings he made with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the chorus — eleven of which won Grammy awards — are still “benchmarks” in the field, according to Smith. Shaw won four other Grammy awards and was nominated this year for two more. He recorded the first classical album on the RCA label to sell over a million copies.\n\nJulian “Cannonball” Adderley was a jazz saxophonist who helped define the hard-bop sound of the 1950s and 60s. Adderley was fearless in exploring fresh musical styles, using his own combination of styles to create a sound that was uniquely his own.\n\nBrother Adderley was initiated into the Gamma Theta Chapter in 1960. He had been introduced to music at an early age by his father and took a particular interest in performing. After several years of side gigs with his own jazz group, Adderley enlisted in the U.S. Army where he led the 36th Army Dance Band.\n\nIn 1955, Adderley made a move to New York and kicked off a career in Jazz with his brother Nat. The two formed a quintet that would ultimately not be successful the first time around, but it did catch the attention of trumpeter Miles Davis. Davis invited Adderley to play with his band, which he did for several years, playing on a number of Davis’ seminal albums. Eventually, Adderley would reunite with his brother, forming the “Cannonball Adderley Quintet.”\n\nFor the next fifteen years, Adderley molded the quintet’s sound using the experience he gained from playing with Miles Davis. His later albums and styles were influenced by electric jazz as the quintet made appearances at festivals, concerts, and even a few movies. Adderley spent the last five years of his life teaching and lecturing on his lifelong passion for the art of jazz until his death in 1975.\n\nDavid Scull Bispham was an American operatic baritone. Bispham was born on January 5, 1857 in Philadelphia, the only child of William Danforth Bispham and Jane Lippincott Scull. Both of Bispham’s parents were members of the Society of Friends. In 1867, the family relocated to New Jersey. In 1872, Bispham entered Haverford College, from which he was graduated in 1876. After graduation, Bispham entered the wool business with his mother’s brothers, all the while continuing to develop his musical talents as an amateur. Bispham appeared in numerous musical performances in his childhood despite having no formal musical training. In 1885, Bispham married the daughter of General Charles Sawyer Russell, they would go on to have four children: Jeanette, Vida and David. The Bisphams honeymooned in Europe, when they returned to Philadelphia, Bispham found work with the Lehigh Valley Railroad. While employed with the railroad, Bispham spent his spare time singing with local clubs and an Episcopal church choir in Philadelphia.\n\nAt twenty-eight he went to Europe, studying singing in Florence with Luigi Vannuccini and in Milan with Francesco Lamperti. He studied in Bayreuth. In 1891 he was selected from among fifty applicants to perform the role of the Duc de Longueville in a London performance of André Messager’s La Basoche, he was engaged by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden to sing the part of Beckmesser in Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg in June 1892. This production was to feature Jean de Reszke, Emma Albani, Jean Lassalle in the other leading roles. De Reszke fell ill during rehearsals, the production had to be cancelled. On the day of the cancellation, Bispham was asked to substitute on the following day as Kurwenal in Richard Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, under Gustav Mahler; this was Bispham’s first Wagner role. According to his memoir, referred to below, Bispham had learned that role and several others following the advice of a medium at a seance, his success there brought him a contract for Covent Garden, where he appeared in Wagnerian roles, for all but two of the next ten seasons.\n\nBispham made his American debut, once again in Wagner, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on November 18, 1896. He remained with the company until 1903, singing Wagnerian roles. Bispham was influential in establishing the career of Carrie Jacobs-Bond as in 1901 he gave a recital featuring her songs in Chicago’s Studebaker Theatre. After 1903 Bis"
