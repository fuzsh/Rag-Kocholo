        "text": "Lecturer in Francophone Literature\n\n(Strasbourg University)\n\nLe meilleur moyen de faire croire que tu connais tout,\n\nc’est de ne jamais avoir l’air étonné. [The best way to get people to believe you know everything is to never seem surprised.]\n\nSam Lion, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo in the Claude Lelouch film Itinéraire d’un enfant gâté (1988)\n\nFirst available on bookstore shelves in the summer of 2018, Camarade Papa is the second novel by Armand Patrick Gbaka-Brédé, a writer of Ivoirian origin who is better known by his nom de plume, Gauz. The book’s publication coincided with the anniversary of its Paris publisher, Atilla, and is augmented by a brief postface entitled “Les dix ans,” a retrospective look at the trajectory of this young publishing house1. Featured in the Atilla catalogue alongside Maryam Madjidi, the Franco-Iranian author of Marx et la poupée2, Gauz is described in the postface as one of the “auteurs français bien vivants, à la plume lumineuse et caustique” [lively authors, whose pen is luminous and caustic] who have ensure Nouvel Attila’s “plus beaux succès” [greatest successes]. It is true that his first novel, Debout payé3, a description of several generations of African security guards employed by large French companies, was very well received. Capitalizing on this success, the succinct postface is rich of praise, highlighting the audacity of a publisher that rises to every challenge and prestigious comparison:\n\nLike a certain NRF, the publishing house arose from a journal in 2007. A voracious journal that cleared libraries, as well as the city and typography. This horde dreamt of hacking the literary Pantheon by fleecing known authors in order to ensure that unknown authors were read. While the house will not create a tabula rasa, it will assuredly cultivate the literary weeds4.\n\nGauz, because he is the lone author of African origin to be published by a publishing house committed to publishing texts representing every possible perspective, takes the opposite position, however. The eulogies and prizes bestowed upon his publications illustrate the effectiveness of this strategy quite well: it is no exaggeration to affirm that, although a novice, he has been “spoiled.” As the first book to win the prize awarded by bookseller Gibert Joseph, the magazine Lire also selected Debout payé as “Best First French Novel of the Year.” For its part, Camarade Papa was awarded the “Ivoire” prize in 2018 by a jury led by the novelist Werewere Liking. It also won the Grand Prix Littéraire d’Afrique Noire. Gauz’s success is thus demonstrated by prizes that do not exclusively belong to a system of “neocolonial” recognition, to use terms used by Claire Ducournau to critique the Grand Prix Littéraire d’Afrique Noire: distinguished in Europe by a booksellers’ prize that cannot be suspected of an affinity for political institutions, it also benefits from an African recognition certified by the “Ivoire” prize.\n\nMy point here, however, is not to employ the methods of the sociology of literature to highlight the remarkable success of Gauz’ two earlier novels. Instead, I would like to propose an attentive reading of the text of Camarade Papa by inscribing it in a two-fold, diachronic profundity: first, in the history of colonization, since his novel, freely inspired by a range of archival material, eloquently illustrates the problem of “postcolonial uses of the colonial;” and second, in literary history. Concerning the second point, my analysis will focus on the continuity of the analyses of Anthony Mangeon, who argues that literary renewal on which the signers of the “Manifeste pour une littérature-monde en français” [Manifest for a world literature in French]7 in 2007 pride themselves, generally leads to the renewal of recipes that their predecessors had previously tested:\n\nThe editorial scene remains unchanged, with the race for literary prizes and the preference of Parisian publishers; and the addition to restating the past ultimately reveals itself all the more vivid in that the recovery can henceforth nourish itself from several traditions: we thus resume the tradition of the oralized narrative (“French” with Céline, but also “francophone” with Cendrars and Ramuz) to rewrite South American literature; we allude to fellow writers (Patrice Nganang, Bertène Juminer) while we clone their novels; we celebrate power literature in order to better market juju literature... Do we not run the risk of confounding writing with a certain kind of handicraft, a simple “operative gymnastics,” as Ouologuem noted in his Lettre à la France nègre?8\n\nHere, Anthony Mangeon reveals the gap between the posture of a manifest that resembles the tones of the laudatory self-portrait that Nouvel Attila permitted themselves, and the contents of texts that merely turn gold into lead, transforming old glints of light into routine, sputtering, everyday currency.\n\n“Some and others”: Maxime Dabilly and Anuman Shaoshan Illitch Davidovitch\n\n© BNF, Société de Géographie department, Gallica\n\nAfter Treich’s premature death, every trace of him was effaced by his successor, the officer Louis-Gustave Binger, who is therefore unfairly credited with founding the French colonial administration in Côte d’Ivoire. The eight chapters that Gauz devoted to this imperial gesture are attributed to the plume of a fictional character named Maxime Dabilly who leaves the city associated with his name (Abilly is the site of the confluence of the Claise and the Creuse) for Châtellerault and later, La Rochelle, where he is hired by Verdier’s trading company and volunteered to go to Africa. This decision makes Dabilly a contemporary and almost the alter ego of Marcel Treich, whom Verdier hired in 1883 to work on his plantations. Dabilly, however, shares several details with the Strasbourg native Louis-Gustave Binger. Indeed, he frequented Alsatian refugees in the arms factories of the region of Lyon, including Gauz’ efforts to transcribe the accent, supported by substituted consonants and fictional approximations of German. In this working-class milieu, Dabilly first heard the name, or rather, the nickname, of Louis-Gustave Binger and became familiar with the widespread notion that colonization provided compensation for the territorial losses that followed the debacle in Sedan:\n\n— My yongue cousin, he is currently there [in Africa]. His name iss Louis-Gustave. At home, vee call him LG.\n\n— Where is he precisely?\n\n— He eez fraum Niederbronn, near Sarreguemines.\n\n— Woher! Nicht wo!\n\n— He asked where, not from where!\n\n— Congue, they told me Congue.\n\n— You should have heard Congo.\n\n— How can I know ziss?\n\n— In Africa, there is the Congo and the Sudan. That’s it.\n\n— Zudan, diss tells me somesink.\n\n— That’s what I thought. Your cousin left for Congo from Sudan […]\n\n— Ah, his departure, he svore to come back viss a territory ten times greater dan Elsass and Lorraine togezzah.\n\n— Nossing is greater than Alsace and Lorraine.13\n\nBecause it is set a century later, however, the second narrative takes place within a resolutely post-colonial context15 whose every formulation is charged – for example, in the childish questioning of the novel’s title character “Camarade Papa” – with the rhetoric of communism. This time, the narrator is the young Anuman Shaoshan Illitch Davidovitch, born in the Netherlands of black or mixed parents (the eponymous Camarade Papa and Les-Grands-Soirs-Maman), who is firmly convinced that Revolution is imminent. Preparing for the Revolution, they hurriedly sent their son to stay with family in Côte d’Ivoire, but only after making her responsible for the triumph of the proletariat.\n\nThe plot’s two elements converge when it becomes apparent that Anuman is none other than Dabilly’s descendant, the fruit of a sexual relationship between “the agent-symbol”16 and a woman he met in Grand Bassam a few days after his arrival. The daughter that she bears and whom he baptizes in homage to Treich and a local queen, Alloua-Treissy, reveals herself to be Anuman’s grandmother and, like in a Molière comedy, the novel concludes with an emotionally charged scene of familial recognition. After gathering on Dabilly’s tomb (he died in 1936), the grandmother and his grandson examine the papers left by the ancestor on his death, including “a bunch of stories”17 that become the basis for the colonial aspect of Gauz’ novel. Unsatisfied with the two narrators who shared their genealogy, the conclusion thus supplies its own material pretext by inventing, in the form of Maxime Dabilly’s memoirs, an original manuscript that was adapted and transcribed by the author.\n\nThe removable banner that envelopes the book’s cover reinforces the connection between its twin narratives – one colonial, the other postcolonial. Indeed, the front cover features an image by the photographer Bernard Descamps representing a Malagasy child dressed in an oversized raincoat, arms outstretched toward the sea as if attempting to fly. The back cover shows a map of Côte d’Ivoire with dotted lines that traces Treich’s explorations from 1887 and 1889. The image suggests a link between “the postcolonial child” – the perfect representation of what Jean-Loup Amselle called “l’art de la friche” [the art of the wasteland] in 200518 – and colonial conquest, which thus represented the reverse side or implicit background of the photograph.\n\n“To both of us”: Portraits of Gauz and Alain Mabanckou as Literary Twins\n\nGauz’ “detective” interpretation implies first of all pausing to consider the filiations and literary influences that he displays and next, inquiring about those that he might tend to conceal. I would therefore like to launch my analysis of his novel by seeking to ascertain the source – and perhaps even more, of the twin narratives that the author of Camarade Papa combines.\n\nThe two writers shared cosmopolitan identities as world travelers, making them, as Alain Mabanckou has pointed out several times in literary and critical writings, veritable “migratory birds” engaged in a triangular circulation between Africa, America, and the Old Continent22. Their kinship is also vestimentary, since the two accomplices, whose embrace illuminated the interview, both presented themselves in jeans and black T-shirts, far removed from the fireman’s outfit sported by Alain Mabanckou during his 2016 talk at the Collège de France. Their vestimentary coordination reinforced the impression they are interchangeable authors, united, if one believes the article’s author, with “explosive laughter” that recalls a bit excessively, the “Banania laughter” heard “railing from every wall in France”23 by Senghor.\n\nThe similarities between the two men are not limited to shared clothing tastes or the complicity that they appear to cultivate, however. They can also be seen in their writing and in the same childhood narrative borrowed from the francophone writer of Polish origin, Émile Ajar/Romain Gary, specifically in the remarkable present of La Vie devant soi24. Indeed, in 2010, Alain Mabanckou published a loosely autobiographical childhood narrative, Demain j’aurai vingt ans, in which he returned to the Congo of the 1970s-1980s and that was narrated by his young hero, Michel. By employing a juvenile voice in Camarade Papa, Gauz acknowledge his debt towards Romain Gary more openly than Mabanckou, even assigning a social life to his young hero that resembles that of Momo, was raised by a prostitute, in La Vie devant soi. In the absence of his mother, Gauz’ lead character, Anuman Shaoshan Illitch Davidovitch, finds refuge with a “seller of kisses” named Yolanda.\n\nBoth passages illustrate defectively assimilated Marxist rhetoric that distinguishes Engels’ “angels” from the valets of imperialism and other “suppositories” of big capital. The flaws in a child’s language serve as a pretext for the systematic deformation of the economic history that Comrade Papa describes, converting the first crisis of the purses into a contagious “great illness of purses” and transforming capitalism into a venereal disease. The comic inaccuracies of this child-like transposition recall the distortions of “petit nègre,” the simplified language used by colonials to communicate with riflemen recruited in Africa whose name itself echoes a child’s linguistic game. As Cécile Van den Avenne has observed, in the late nineteenth century when the term petit nègre first appeared, it was used to refer to “speaking, in this case French, like a nègre or petit nègre, i.e., like a black and a child.29”\n\n“The Adventure is the adventure”: Binger, Treich, and Nebout\n\nGauz’ talk at the Collège de France was unquestionably a matrix of the writing of Camarade Papa, in which the character Binger serves as an anti-hero as foul-smelling as he is arrogant, and quick to usurp Treich’s more legitimate glory:\n\nYour man arrived here hungry, sick, skeletal, stinking of hyena. Even though there’s not a single white man for a thousand kilometers, he dared to pull out some kind of white man’s document to demand that we submit to him and to France! In the name of Islam, we submit only to Allah. He escaped publicly execution because Karamoko Oulé Wattara convinced the council that he was mentally ill. He was told to move on to the south where he wanted to go. He went straight north. Today, it’s been ten months and we just heard that he’s in Bondoukou, directly east. If you are saying that that man is your superior and that he’s even a captain in your army, the meeting just ended38.\n\nTreich, on the contrary, is not only capable of finding his way, but also a connoisseur of local practices. A few pages later, the signature of the treaty with Karamoko Oulé Wattara (1889) is also presented as a “comedy in three acts by Marcel Treich,” whose successive phases took religion, the profit motive, and the local populations’ animist beliefs into account. The striking contrast between the portraits of the two men could be reduced to an onomastic comparison by a type of extreme stylization. While the comedic aspect of Gauz’ Collège de France talk was partly the product of an unflattering, elliptical play on pronunciation “les rêves de Kong de Binger” [Binger’s Kong-like dreams] (vs. “les rêves de con de Binger” [Binger’s asshole-like dreams]), Treich was granted a degree of prestige merely through the pronunciation of his name:\n\nHe [Bricard: an official whom Dabilly met in Elima] informs me that I will be assigned to a “post in a wooded zone in the north of Assinia.” In this unknown territory, I will have to build and occupy an outpost. […] What about the exact spot where I am going to settle? “Treich is the only one who has gone that far up. He will guide you.” What about the dates of my assignment?” “Treich will decide. He always wants to leave time for acclimatation.” All of the answers go through Treich, the French resident delegate. A saint. Treich knows. Treich understands. Treich can. Treich goes. People don’t speak of him—they invoke him. His name pronounced with a whisper at the end adds to his mystique: Treicccchhhh!39\n\nThis prolonged sound at the end of Treich’s name contrasts with the insulting appendix that precedes Binger’s name. Treich is represented as a an influential, near-prophetic figure. The novel’s colonial dimension cannot be reduced to these occasional contrasts between the two adventurers from a postcolonial retrospective point of view, however. In an interview with Natalie Levisalles in En attendant Nadeau, Gauz sketches a further intertext by making the main character, Maxime Dabilly, the epigone of a third member of the colonial apparatus who is less well known Treich and Binger. Indeed, he confirmed having found inspiration in a collection of letters by Albert Nebout that was published in 1995, nearly a hundred years after they were written and over fifty years after their author’s death:\n\nAnd then I assembled some material. In Abidjan in the “bookstores on the floor,” you can find incredible books that have spent years in cellars or suitcases and that exist nowhere else. One book that helped me a great deal was the correspondence of Albert Nebout, who lived in Côte d’Ivoire from 1894 to 1910. He is the only colonial I know of who returned to France with his African wife and their children. In his letters to a friend of his who was a notary, Nebout confided his concerns, very personal things… For a reader today, his words might appear racist. In fact, at the time, there were no other words to designate people and their behavior. It could seem racist, but he took his wife, “la belle Ago,” and the children to France. This correspondence inspired me. Based on my reading, I decided to pursue my interest in the letters instead of administrative reports. The book gave me the sound of the Maxime Dabilly’s language and his way of writing and speaking40.\n\nNebout encountered the most prominent figures of colonial history during his career, including Maurice Delafosse, Gabriel Angoulvant, and Louis-Gustave Binger42. To believe Gauz, however, the parallel between the fictional Dabilly and the real Nebout is less based on similar professional itineraries than on kindred styles, as well as what might be described as their amorous ethics. Concerning the first point, an attentive reading of the second half of Nebout’s epistolary memoirs, which cover his administrative functions in Côte d’Ivoire, helps to identify echoes in Gauz’ narrative. This includes the moment when the administrator describes the escapades of an Alsatian newcomer, presented as Binger’s cousin, to his correspondent:\n\nDelafosse went on leave. He is a hard worker and the public servant of the future. He writes from morning to evening. He methodically studies languages, and he speaks Baoulé like a Baoulé, with emphasis and nasalization. […] He is replaced by M. M… He is not the same type. Shorter than Delafosse, the new arrival is fatter. He is a solid, blond guy who once served in the Foreign Legion. […] People tell an amusing story about his accent. He was working in Bassam as a schoolteacher. He dictated the following sentence to the little Blacks: “la renard a manché la boule,” [the fox ated (sic) the ball]. And of course, the children wrote boule and not poule [chicken]. And M… exclaimed: “Mais sapristi! Je ne vous dis pas la poule, je vous dis la boule!” [But sapristi, I didn’t say la poule. I’m saying la boule.] The children understood nothing. He didn’t hate humor. From Dabou, where he was chief of the outpost, on July 14th, he sent a small box containing three ducklings painted blue, white, and red to his cousin Governor Binger43.\n\nIt is tempting to consider the source of the dialogue between Alsatians referred to earlier in this article, in which a loquacious cousin of Louis-Gustave’s also participated. The reference to what Gauz called a “francité houspillée” [chastised Frenchness]44 in his talk at the Collège de France, a quality shared by colonizers and colonized, and hence a heritage of Nebout’s texts, of which Gauz’ novel suggests a “postcolonial use” by adopting and extending a certain thought. Another feature shared by both texts is the description of rival factions as “negrophiles” et “negrophobes.” Nebout portrayed them as follows:\n\nThe role of administrators is, according to my idea, to bring natives to us using proper procedures, and not to distance them with violence and insults. I promised myself that I would always be approachable, affable, patient, and calm, while also being firm and fair. […] In any case, I have never been, and hope never to be, either negrophile or negrophobe. I have known both specimens only too well. The former are often ridiculous and can be dangerous. The latter are odious and incapable of approaching a Black without insulting or mistreating him45.\n\nMaxime Dabilly inherits the laudable concern of not adhering to either camp, and Gauz reinforces his narration reinforces by seating them at different places around a table:\n\nThe seating arrangement is invariable: Bricard and Péan along one side, Dejean and Fourcarde facing them, and Dreyfus and me at each end. Fourcade explains to me that Bricard and Péan are négrophiles, the worst sort of white men in the colonies. Péan explains that his friends on the opposite side of the table are négrophobes, the worst sort of white men in the colonies. The negrophobes use “nègres” for men, “négresses” for women, “sauvages” for groups. They say “nègre” with their chins held high and a superior air, emphasizing the accent by lifting a corner of their lips. “Négresse” whistles its final “s,” forming a rictus of concupiscence on their faces. “Sauvage” rounds the eyes and compresses the nose to convoke the image. The négrophiles have a panoply of nominal groups loaded with epithets. “Tirailleurs sénégalais,” “porteurs mandés-dyoulas,” “robuste Kroumen,” “jolie Apolonienne,” “belle Fanti,” “fine Malinké,” “superbe mulâtresse,” “horrible Akapless”… They know the races and do not hesitate to offer generalities. When I was asked my views, I used a mix of references. In medio stat virtus46.\n\nThe child’s skin color had immediately aroused his suspicion that his mother had been unfaithful. Nebout accused her of being married to another man and, as this cruel anecdote suggests, the newborn’s “handsome black” skin was tantamount to a death sentence. The situation was different a year later when Ago introduced a child to Nebout, who had returned from an expedition:\n\nAfter eight days of somewhat difficult travel on horseback because the rivers were still flooded, we arrived in Guiguewi. Scarcely had I descended from my horse when I saw my little Ago coming towards me holding a completely naked baby in her arms whom she gravely presented to me. I embraced mother and child without shame. She was a little girl of three months. There can be no doubt that I am a jeweler: my baby, whose skin was scarcely tinted with yellow, was adorable. She had a Baoulé name that I found lovely: Aya49.\n\nThe fate of Adjo, Dabilly’s lover, differs significantly from that of Etien, who died, repudiated, in childbirth, or Agua, repudiated, or even Ago, who is taken back to France after the end of her husband’s career. Gauz’ hero does not entirely mimic Nebout’s ambiguous position, but instead represents at most a stylized version that is largely stripped of contradictions. The choice of simplifying the postcolonial representation of racial mixing in colonial times is far from the subtlety with Gauz that it achieves with the Congolese author, Henri Lopes, himself mixed-race and the author of several novels that explore problems encountered by mixed couples50.\n\nLouis Anno, whose signature appears on the treaty between Captain Binger and the Chief of the State of Diammala (1892), is depicted as Treich’s African alter ego, with harmonious features and an almost effeminate presence. This mimetic desire to unite the colonial official with his interpreter appears to an authorial invention. It is not mentioned by contemporary observers, although some do mention that Louis Anno tended to “take on European airs.” As for the photograph taken of him during Binger’s travels, there is no sign of the coquettish accessories described by Gauz. While the interpreter did wear a shirt bound at the waist by a rolled loincloth, there is no trace of the pipe or pompom.\n\nArchives nationales d’outre-mer\n\nIt also seems probable that the portrayal of an androgynous Louis Anno stems from the preciousness and hypercorrection of his language, emphasized by the photographer, Marcel Monnier, who mocked Anno’s “oratorical precautions” and “prud’hommesques [pretentious] paraphrases”53. Gauz, then, transposed this essentially linguistic portrait of Louis Anno to offer an image, not of the often-mocked scholarly air of early “écrivains-instituteurs” [writer-teachers]54, but of traits associated with a precious, effeminate figure. Beyond the stereotyping of this representation, this specific, regrettable hypothesis is neither developed nor explained in the novel. Nor is there any reference to Anno’s fate after Treich’s death or his subsequent employment as Binger’s interpreter. Indeed, the novel abandons this brief foray into a form of postcolonial rewriting of colonial history.\n\n“Chance or Coincidence”: A Few Echoes of Monénembo\n\nMore fundamentally, at the heart of both narratives is an impassioned explorer figure who, because they are not full members of the colonial apparatus, are gradually moved from center stage onto the sidelines of history. According to Gauz’ narrative, Binger’s imminent arrival is repeatedly framed as a danger for Treich, who hears the following prophecy:\n\nYou told us that you were going to look for your white brother. The fetishes are unanimous: Do not return with him. If you find this man, put him to death. Next, cut off small bits of anything that sticks out—hair, nails, nose, genitals—and throw them in the first river that blocks your way. […] If you aren’t strong enough, abandon him! He will die like lost white men die here, delirious with fever and laying in pestilential puddles of diarrhea. If you bring him to the coast, this man will devour your soul and you will disappear without descendants58.\n\nThe prediction comes true, and Treich dies after he brings Binger to the coast, leaving him the historic privilege of having “given Côte d’Ivoire to France,” as his tombstone recalls. At the last minute, the soldier replaced the adventurer, who was condemned to the oblivion of memory. The same takes place in Le Roi de Kahel, in which the industrialist Aimé Olivier de Sanderval, who is planning to build a railway in Fulani country and seeks to sign treaties with local chiefs. He is replaced by men sent by the colonial government, particularly the first governor of French Guinea, Doctor Noël Ballay. Indeed, the main character himself emphasizes the irreducible dichotomy between two men of imagination and two others who are part of the system:\n\nNow, we must build. Institutions, of course, but above all roads, and buildings, both for the government and for men like him who are unbowed, imaginative, and ambitious. And for that, we didn’t need to complicate the idle lives of office clerks and parliamentarians. […] Who had made America? Pioneers, of course, and not paper-shufflers in Washington!59\n\nSanderval is wrong in imagining that Africa will become the chosen land of free and imaginative men, of whom he considers himself a paragon: he is evicted from his “kingdom” by Ballay, who views him as “a mythomaniac scumbag” and thinks it is impossible for “his colony to succeed” in the presence of such a nuisance60. A further insight in this intertextual comparative study is that Gauz and Monénembo’s unfortunate heroes both dream of settling in Africa in strangely similar ways. Dabilly, describing the compound he has had built in Assikasso as “my Versailles61”, is part of an irony-laced dream that is shared by Monénembo’s Sanderval:\n\nNo, it wasn’t the Château de Versailles, but amid bamboo and vines, it looked a bit like it, with a splendid colonial house cluttered by staircases and balustrades and a vast garden gently sloping toward the softly splashing sea62.\n\nGauz introduces a similar comparison between the Agny Princess, Malan Alloua, and Catherine de Medici, who, it is worth recalling, was King Henri III’s mother:\n\nMalan Alloua bears some resemblance to Catherine de Medici. Both have graceless traits. They know how to play the poisoned vial. Numerous enemies at court have tasted their specialties and died. Each is as sanctimonious as the other and is willing to use their firm religious convictions towards bloody methods to settle divergences of opinion about the sacred. The Europeans tricked heretics in their thousands, scrawled a Saint Bartholomew in letters of horror, soaked in Protestant blood. The African is assiduous at fetish ceremonies that require accessories taken from human anatomy. Alive or dead, there are no taboos on her collection methods64.\n\nBoth books compare local royalties’ torments with celebrated episodes of French history, an implicitly effort to contradict the stereotype of an Africa without history, or rather of an Africa whose history began only with colonization.\n\nThis does not encompass the inspiration drawn from colonial-era texts, an approach that both authors share. Monénembo’s method appears both richer and more rigorous than Gauz’ approach, however. Unlike Gauz, who makes no mention of Nebout in the body of his narrative or even in the preface, dedication, or notes, Monénembo explicitly declares his reliance on the archives and offers thanks to the Sanderval family and the staff of the Archives départementales in the French city of Caen. In an article examining intertextualities between Le Roi de Kahel and the narratives of Olivier de Sanderval, Florence Paravy demonstrates that this rewriting requires a form of literary adaptation that combines faithfulness to the original with liberties such as additions and occasional deletions66. Monénembo pairs his literary exploitation of archives with a reflection on the stakes surrounding colonial writing, which is presented as the Romanesque counterpart to triumphal positivism:\n\nBy coincidence, our future King of Africa corresponded nicely to the Bantu proverb that says, “We are more the sons of our epoch than of our fathers.” He was the spitting image of the little man of the 19th!... Ordem et progresso!... His education, his temperament, everything prepared him to vibrate with the passions of his century. Ideas, sciences, great voyages. He had been imbued with a pioneer mentality, amid a century of pioneers! He had envisioned life from early on as a steep staircase stretching towards exploits. Heroes had their legends, and the obstinate quest for greatness and plenitude would have its book. And that book would be called L’Absolu, the sum of his thoughts, the fusion of every parallel, of the idea and life, the real and the void, being and God. Begun when he was twelve, this modern-day Métaphysique was now in its twentieth draft. René Caillé had left travel journals, but he would leave a logbook, as well as a way of thinking; it would be a lyrical work, but also an encyclopedia67.\n\nIf Camarade Papa does in fact constitute a rewriting of Roi de Kahel in the sense proposed by Jean-Louis Cornille, the apostle is clearly lesser than the model, either in terms of the rigor of archival work or the quality of the literary contemplation of the imperial experience. In standing tall to nourish the postcolonial memory of the colonial, Gauz intelligently adopts an approach that had already earned Tierno Monénembo a prestigious literary prize. By introducing a second plot that centers on the character of Anuman, it reinforces the postcolonial dimension of a narrative sprinkled with communist rhetoric, while also winking at the colonial uses of the “petit nègre.” This addition, however, itself borrowed from other authors, does not suffice to counterbalance the relative anemia of the colonial intertext, whose historic and literary tenor remain relatively weak. Invoking historical figures such as Treich and Louis Anno is ultimately too fleeting to allow a true incarnation, while Nebout’s text is amputated from its more ambiguous sections, probably of most interest to contemporary readers. The writing itself inherits a certain tendency to “bad writing” that is only partly justified by the pretense of a childhood narrative. Dabilly’s notebooks, unlike Sanderval’s, do not aspire to become literary works. They are ultimately daily note-taking that does not even adopt the epistolary form of Nebout’s chronicles. Ten years later, in sum, the itinerary of the adventurers of the empire, decidedly spoiled by literature, continues to motivate authors, but the profundity of the postcolonial narrative about the colonial has not uniformly improved.\n\n“All This for That?”: La francophonie in the Gut\n\nIn guise of a conclusion, I would like to quickly discuss another francophone novel that attracted even greater attention than Camarade Papa during the autumn literary season of 2018. This detour seems necessary to me to illustrate a phenomenon of rewriting and recovery that, although not systematic, nevertheless appears typical of contemporary francophone literary production, constructed by “rewriting” earlier texts. These works belong to the domains of archives or literary history. In this centenary year, David Diop’s brief story, Frère d’âme, is coincidentally dedicated to the gesture of le tirailleur sénégalais72.\n\nThe story relates how Alfa Ndiaye, who witnessed his friend Mademba Diop’s death, a friend with whom he shared kinship based on humor, but somber in a murderous insanity that led him to in spite of himself to confirm every cliché of the bloodthirsty ferocity of African soldiers. A former master in cutting off the hands of Germans whom he had already disemboweled, Alfa Ndiaye is ultimately sent to a hospital for psychiatric treatment. The novel’s second section focuses on this cure, alternating between African reminiscences that lead the sharpshooter to recall memories of his mother or of his first lover, as well as inspired in the bedridden soldier by the doctor’s daughter. In one of the final scenes, Alfa Ndiaye enters the daughter’s bedroom to relieve the desire that she provokes in him and, in attempting to stifle her protests, he ultimately suffocates her.\n\nAlthough located in an entirely different historical period, Diop’s narrative, which won the French Goncourt des Lycéens prize, share a number of important points with Gauz. Summoning a vast repertoire of clichés and stereotypes, he draws on simple language that attempts to imitate, not childish language, but an approximate tirailleur dialect. From the literary angle, he is less successful in evoking forgotten ways of speaking than in constituting a literary “petit nègre” replete with syntactic shortcuts and repetitions. While the reinvention of this language unquestionably counts as a postcolonial use of the colonial, the study by Cécile Van den Avenne invites criticism of an extreme syntactic and lexical simplification that, while providing authors with a somewhat facile literary device does not reflect the tremendous diversity of colonial language varieties:\n\nThe oral usages of French learned outside the school setting by illiterate Africans, at least in French […] were without the least doubt far more varied than what was revealed by the highly stereotyped representations of le français-tirailleur73.\n\nDavid Diop’s narrative also relies on rewritten, simplified literary references. The young woman’s murder powerfully recalls the scene in the novel Native Son by the black American writer Richard Wright, in which Bigger Thomas assassinates a young woman named Mary Dalton74. Although their consequences are similarly dramatic, the two situations are fundamentally different: whereas Alfa Ndiaye gives in to a savage, all-consuming passion that leads him to commit a violent crime, Bigger Thomas does not suffocate Mary merely because of fears of being caught in her room and accused of rape, but by virtue of the stereotypes that make the black man a sexual predator who is perpetually on the hunt for white flesh. One character kills voluntarily by raping, and the other kills involuntarily out of fear of being unfairly accused. Unlike Wright’s story, David Diop’s narrative does not show a man trapped by clichés, but indeed by their repeated incarnation. This discreet rewriting of an African American novel could help shed light on the remarkable trans-Atlantic reception of Frère d’âme, including the Man Booker Prize in 2021 for David Diop, the first French author to win the prize. This can also be understood as the manifestation of a memorial duty towards colonial soldiers and implicit recognition of a filiation between an American novel published in the midst of World War Two and a contemporary francophone narrative.\n\nTwo conclusions come to mind as we near the end of this literary study centered on Gauz’ Camarade Papa, which is positioned – thanks to its author’s success – as a representative work of contemporary francophone African literature. The first of these insights concerns the links between these literatures and history, most especially colonial history. The return to the period of imperial conquest or the participation of African soldiers alongside French troops in the First and Second World Wars, unquestionably constitutes a “postcolonial usage of the colonial” by francophone African authors. Recognized by prestigious literary prizes, this usage could even be described as strategic and is consistent with the imperatives of memory and repair75 and gaining national and international recognition for the authors, particularly in the West.\n\nThe question that then arises is whether this postcolonial persistence of the colonial is not in danger of drifting towards purely instrumental uses that treat narratives as seamlessly marketable commercial products rather than full-fledged literary works or historically grounded reflections. I have suggested that in this book, the answer to this question lies in the genealogy of francophone letters, following Jean-Louis Cornille and Anthony Mangeon, conceived of as a system of echoes and rewritings. Comparing Monénembo and Gauz’ novels, as well as those of Diop and Richard Wright, clearly brings to note the durability of a postcolonial use of the colonial, but also of a certain distancing effect or weakening of the original narrative. The archive is increasingly distant and decreasingly referred to. On the other hand, the simplifying force of stereotype imposes itself with renewed vigor. The risk is all the more explicit in that the diagnosis suggested by Mongo Beti at the end of the last century appears all the more valid today: contemporary African literature, submitted more to the judgement of the media than to academics, tends to be viewed as a perpetual novelty that is detached from its own history, simultaneously postcolonial and colonial, and henceforth rich in masterpieces.\n\nFor this reason, I have attempted to take the opposite position here by striving to show how much recent francophone literary works have inherited from earlier works. As well as the potential loss of substance and literary quality that has been encouraged by commercialism or thoughtful literary and editorial strategies. At first sight, such observations assuredly do not constitute a plea for novelty or the existing literary system. As early as 1950, Julien Gracq deplored the proliferation a “literature of the gut,” i.e., a woeful tendency on the French literary scene, and to an even greater extent, of criticism, to become enamored of recently published texts that are solely celebrated for their novelty:\n\nThe overbearing demands of great writers makes almost every new arrival [on the literary scene] appear to come from a hothouse: he dopes himself; he labors, he thrashes his ribs. He seek to be equal to what is expected of him, equal to his epoch. As for the critic, he does not want to let go, regardless of cost he will discover. It is his mission—this is not a period like the other – each week, he must have something to throw into from his horn: a Tahitian philosopher, a convict’s graffiti – Rimbaud redivivus. Sometimes he looks like a frightened trumpet that blares at everything out of fear of missing something, amid the ritual, colorful fiesta that our “literary life” has become: the exit of the racing bull and the picador’s horse76.\n\nSurely, we must acknowledge that “the [present] epoch,” defined by the postcolonial turn, in indeed an epoch unlike others – if only because it does not authorize the advent of new, innovative voices that have emerged from former colonies to impose an undeniable duty of memory and repair. This situation does not justify, however, for francophone African literature – which the Congolese writer Sony Labou Tansi described as written “from the gut77” – the visceral link to the “interior country,” or being reduced to little more than a “literature of the stomach” in pursuit of prestigious Parisian and international distinctions, henceforth disconnected from its original continent. In order to better pay homage to the creations of African authors and help them become part of literary history, let us ensure, then, as best we can, that we follow the model offered by the African adventurer Sam Lion, whom Claude Lelouch brought to the big screen: Facing a seemingly innovative work, let us read further, expand our knowledge of francophone literatures. Let us enter into their fabrication and, above all, let us not appear to be too “astonished.”\n\nNotes\n\nUnfold notes and references\n\nRetour vers la note de texte 15493\n\n1\n\nFounded in 2009 at the initiative of Benoît Virot and Frédéric Martin, the Attila workshops split in 2013 to form Le Nouvel Attila and Le Tripode.\n\nRetour vers la note de texte 15492\n\n2\n\nMaryam Madjidi, Marx et la poupée, Paris, Le Nouvel Attila, 2017.\n\nRetour vers la note de texte 15491\n\n3\n\nGauz, Debout payé, Paris, Le Nouvel Attila, 2014.
