        "text": "Parisian authorities could trace Suzanne Barbala’s whereabout on September 1, 1922, with almost absolute precision. The eleven-year-old girl left her home at 4, boulevard Port Royal in the fifth arrondissement in the early afternoon. She walked south to a pharmacy in the nearby thirteenth arrondissement, and then she hoped to visit her grandmother, who also lived in the thirteenth. But her grandmother wasn’t home, and now Suzanne’s motives and intentions became a little less clear. She made her way to the Madelon cinema, at 174 avenue d’Italie in the thirteenth, but probably not to go to the movies. It was raining that day, and so Suzanne may have tried to shelter herself under the marquee, at least until the downpour stopped. After that, the trail seemed to end, and no one would see Suzanne for almost an entire month.\n\nOn September 29, 1922, the newspaper L’Oeuvre described the Madelon as a “modest cinema,” with a manager, a pianist, a violinist, and a projectionist who doubled as a janitor. Paris had around 200 cinemas at the time, and the Madelon would be one of the many cinémas des quartiers in the city, a neighborhood cinema that showed films in their subsequent runs. Its programs would never be reported in the city’s newspapers, which tended to concentrate on the far more important cinémas d’exclusivité, the first-run exhibition sites, and so it is impossible to tell now, one hundred years later, what was showing on the day of Suzanne’s disappearance. The best evidence we have for the Madelon comes from a November 1922 edition of L’Economiste Français that listed the 1921 “gross receipts” for all of the city’s cinemas. The Madelon reported only 108,000 francs for that year, not the lowest in the city, but far away from the 1.7 million earned by the Neauveautés, the 1.5 million taken in by the Omnia, or the revenues from many other larger, more important cinemas.\n\nIt was at the end of September 1922 that the pianist at the Madelon, accompanying a silent film, complained about a terrible smell coming from around the screen. As reported in most of the city’s newspapers, this led to a search of the space in back of the screen, and to a grim discovery; a body. At first, the Madelon staff thought it must be that of an animal, but then as L’Oeuvre wrote, “they saw it was human,” and that, grimly, it had been expertly “cut into pieces.”\n\nA doctor identified the body as that of a young girl, and then it was determined to be Suzanne, who had been missing for weeks. The autopsy showed that she had put up a significant fight, but that the murderer had overpowered her. Authorities believed that she had been killed near the cinema, perhaps as she sought shelter there from the rain, and then her body hidden behind the screen.\n\nEach day, new details came out. In early-October, Le Journal reported that the murderer must have been a regular at the cinema, and he must have known Suzanne well. Each of the cinema’s employees was questioned, and each one ruled out, except for one, the manager, Jean Cuvillier. Le Journal went on that it was he who reported the murder, but that he had been suspiciously “drenched in sweat” as he spoke to police. He seemed to physically fit the part of murderer. He was about “fifty years old, very strong…with big hands, a big mustache, and a heavy air.” As an afterthought, the story provided something of his employment history, which would later become significant. Before the war, he had managed a cinema in Reims, about 75 miles outside of Paris.\n\nCuvillier maintained his innocence and named two other suspects, as L’Action Française explained on October 7, the projectionist and a young man who did odd jobs around the Madelon. Meanwhile, the press suggested other possible murderers, for example a man who sold flowers on the avenue d’Italie, named by L’Avenir in November 1922.\n\nNevertheless, most of the attention remained on Cuvillier. As hard as they tried, authorities couldn’t prove he was involved in Suzanne’s murder. But they did find troubling details from his past, in Reims. As it turned out, he had been charged there with assaulting a young girl, but the beginning of the war had interrupted his trial, and he had conveniently left for Paris. After police arrested him as a suspect in the Madelon murder, that earlier charge was reinstated, and in March newspapers reported that he had been sentenced to four years in prison for his guilt in the earlier case.\n\nThat still left Suzanne’s murder unsolved, even though suspicion reasonably remained on Cuvillier. In fact, Parisian police never found the person responsible. The press reported on the case frequently, at least until Cuvillier’s sentencing for the previous crime. After that, the case came up now an again, for instance in December 1924, when Le Matin ran an article about “Perpetrators Who Have Escaped Justice for Their Crimes,” about Suzanne’s murder and also that of another very young girl, as well as a few others killed under mysterious circumstances. Two years later, in 1926, Le Petit Journal informed readers that the skeleton of a young girl had been found just outside Paris,in Rambouillet, and began its coverage with, “A new crime, one that brings to mind the murder at the Madelon cinema of the young Suzanne Barbala…has been discovered.” As late as 1929, the case remained a touchstone for legal caution as well as for unintended results. That’s when L’Oeuvre ran an article, “Respect for the Condemned and Contempt for Witnesses,” reminding readers that Cuvillier had been all but convicted although apparently through false testimony, and then had been justifiably—and almost accidentally—found guilty of serious previous crimes.\n\nAs a sign of the ongoing impact of the case on French culture, in 1928 L’Avenir ran a brief piece about various murderers, dating back to the mid-nineteenth century. The article highlighted the most famous and frightening of all the country’s serial killers, Henri Landru, who murdered at least eleven people, all but one of them women, and possibly dozens more during the war, before he was arrested, found guilty, and executed in 1922. The newspaper likened his victims to “the petite Suzanne Barbala,” whose “horribly mutilated body was hidden at the Madelon cinema,” and his methods to Suzanne’s murderer. With this comparison to the terrifying, remorseless Landru, Barbala’s unidentified murderer clearly had entered a pantheon of French criminals.\n\nPerhaps because of the Madelon’s ongoing association with Suzanne’s death, the cinema had changed its name by 1928, the same year as the reference in L’Avenir to Landru and the first year for which I can find reliable listings. By then, the cinema would be identified by its location, on the avenue d’Italie, as the Ciné-Italie. The Italie continued as an exhibition site at least until the beginning of World War Two, when, like all other cinemas in the city, it closed with the German occupation of the city. Over the course of the occupation, the Germans reopened about fifty cinemas, but the small, neighborhood Italie was not one of them. It may have become a working cinema again after the liberation, but by 1949 and the first postwar listings for the entire city that I have been able to locate, there is no longer any cinema at 174, avenue d’Italie. Now, in 2023, there is a housing development at the site, in a style from the 1960s or 70s, with no sign at all of the Madelon cinema, and certainly no indication of the crime that had been discovered there more than one hundred years ago, and that was never solved.\n\nIn the years just before World War Two, the French far right followed their leaders’ directives with violent immediacy. On January 13, 1936, Charles Maurras, the publisher of L’Intransigeant, the most widely read fascist newspaper in France, called for the assassination of some 150 members of government, should they take the country to war in Ethiopia to defend that nation against Benito Mussolini’s invading Italian army. Included in that number was Léon Blum, whom Maurras listed as among many other dangerous “radicals, socialists, and communists.” In just a few months, of course, Blum would be elected Prime Minister of France, becoming the leader of the Popular Front, an alliance of leftwing groups mobilized largely by the rise of so many fascist organizations in France during the 1930s. At the time of Maurras’ editorial, though, Blum served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, representing Narbonne, in Southern France.\n\nThere would be no war with Italy in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, exactly one month after Maurras’ denunciation, on February 13, three members of the fascist group Les Camelots du Roi pulled Blum from his car as he left the chamber in Paris’ seventh arrondissement and beat him practically to death before he managed to get away. The attackers were, no doubt, motivated by Maurras’ call to violence, although given their own animus towards the French left in general and their virulent anti-Semitism, they probably needed little inducement to go after Blum, who was Jewish.\n\nJust a little over a week later, on February 21, the assailants were in a Parisian court for a preliminary hearing. Every prominent newspaper in the country covered the event, and each of them highlighted the same thing about this initial appearance, that a film of the attack was shown in court, in the presence of the presiding magistrate, the prosecuting attorneys, the defense counsel, and the defendants themselves. The movie had been made by amateur filmmaker Gérard Bennett, who may have had his camera that day to get some footage of the funeral procession, near the chamber, of rightwing historian Jacques Bainville, the reason so many fascists had gathered in the area.\n\nNewspapers provided precise details of the movie and its screening. As Le Matin reported, “the film reproduces the entire scene, from the moment the crowd comes running up to the car to the instant Blum takes refuge in a building on the rue de l’Université.” Le Matin, like most other sources, emphasized that there were two showings in court, the first at normal speed, taking four minutes. The second was in “slow motion,” and “was interrupted two or three times to allow identification” of the assailants. One of them, Edouard Aragon, could not be seen. The other, Léon Andurand, was there “for a few moments…smoking a pipe,” while the third, Louis Courtois, “appeared throughout the film,” and “seemed furious, vociferous,” although he could not be seen “throwing punches” at Blum.\n\nMost sources agreed that the film really didn’t show that much. Excelsior, for example, claimed that “the range of the camera was very limited, so the film does not constitute a document of great value.” Le Matin agreed that “the view is incomplete.” But the determination of the film’s worth might also come down to a newspaper’s political inclination. The far rightwing L’Ami du Peuple, which had been founded by perfume magnate and fascist supporter François Coty, informed readers that, “it was in vain that we looked in this film for the famous scene imagined by so many leftwing newspapers, where we might see one of the ‘aggressors’ hitting” Blum.\n\nOne of those “leftwing newspapers,” L’Humanite, actually seemed fairly measured, writing that, “despite the rapidity of the film, we clearly see two of the assailants, Andurand and Courtois.” L’Humanité then added that the latter’s “attitude and movements are particularly revealing,” reinforcing the reporting in the very staid Le Matin and other papers.\n\nOne newspaper emphasized the historical significance of the film, which even transcended the event that it showed. “For the first time in France,” L’Oeuvre wrote on its front page on February 22, “the cinema has been used as evidence in a courtroom.” The article described the two screenings in detail, much more fully than other sources, and then interviewed the judge who had authorized the use of the film. He felt that the footage served as a terrific “means of investigation.” L’Oeuvre claimed that motion pictures as evidence were long overdue, because “justice has been using photography” for so long, and in particular because film had been introduced into American courtrooms years before.\n\nIn fact, US courts had been making use of film as evidence at least since 1923, in a case that was directly related to the popular culture of the period. In this instance, a vaudevillian had severely injured his leg in a car accident. As part of his trial for damages, his lawyer introduced a film of his stage routine, over the objection of the opposing attorney. But it’s unclear when, if ever, an American trial had used movie footage to determine the guilt or innocence of defendants, as in the Blum case. More than anything else, the French instance seems to anticipate Fritz Lang’s first American film, Fury, from 1936, which was released in Paris in the fall of that year to considerable acclaim (see my blogpost from September 1, 2022, at https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/38257950/posts/4230313808). In that movie, the newsreel footage shown in court identified all of the townspeople who had tried to lynch Joe Wilson, an innocent man wrongly accused of kidnapping, and played by Spencer Tracy.\n\nIn France, in the Blum case, the film itself, in addition to serving as evidence, quickly came to be involved in a dispute over ownership. The man who shot the footage went to court in March 1936, claiming that the police had seized his film and refused to return it, and possibly even profited from it, releasing, as they did, frame enlargements to the press. Newspapers reported on the filmmaker’s claim but then seemed to drop it, so the outcome remains unclear. The case against Blum’s attackers, on the other hand, ended much more decisively, if, perhaps, somewhat disappointingly. Newspapers informed readers at the end of April 1936 that two of the three men had been found guilty, and the film clearly had something to do with the verdict. Edouard Aragon, who did not appear in the footage, was released without punishment. Léon Andurand, the man seen mostly smoking his pipe, was sentenced to 15 days in prison, while the “furious, vociferous” Louis Courtois received a sentence of three months, which in each case seems hardly enough given the severity of the attack.\n\nBlum’s term as prime minister lasted only about a year, and the leftwing coalition he represented just a little more than that. If he is remembered today as having any connection with film, it is as the negotiator, with American Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, of the post-World War Two Blum-Byrnes agreement. Along with establishing other commercial contracts between the two nations, the agreement also set the relationship between the French and American motion picture industries, and which typically has been understood as significantly lopsided in favor of the US. But years before that, he was involved in some of the most important amateur footage ever shot, footage that certified, in French courts at least, the place of motion pictures as evidence in criminal trials.\n\nToday, in various national contexts, we might expect such evidence to be used. In the United States, for instance, at least dating to the 1963 film of the Kennedy assassination taken by another amateur, Abraham Zapruder, we have come to accept both the importance and inconclusiveness of cinematic evidence. But in 1936 in France, the footage of the attack on Blum—footage that apparently no longer exists—marked a significant moment in the country’s legal history, providing a new source of proof and also a frustratingly inadequate record of the events of February 13th. The men who attacked Blum seem to have disappeared from the public record after their sentencing. Charles Maurras, the man who had instigated the attack on the deputy from Narbonne that Gérard Bennett recorded, would be arrested as a Nazi collaborator in 1944, after the liberation of Paris, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n“Year after year…the number of prizes given to films and actors increases around the world.” That was the plausible claim made in the April 13, 1949, edition Le Bourgogne Républicain, which then went on that, “even though the great majority of global spectators are women, until now there has never been such a prize chosen by women, judged from the feminine point of view.” All of that had just changed, with the first Grand Prix Féminin, sponsored by the French fashion magazine, Elle.\n\nThat this was the first such prize was all the more remarkable, because there had been other similar awards in the arts for many years. 1904, for example, marked the first year of the Prix Fémina in literature, sponsored, as in the case of the later prize in cinema, by a woman’s magazine, in this case La Vie Heureuse. In one well-known instance, Roland Dorgelès won the Prix Fémina in 1919, for his anti-war novel, Les Croix de Bois, withsome critics complaining that he also should have received the even more prestigious Prix Goncourt, which went, instead, to Marcel Proust for A l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, the second volume of À la recherches du temps perdu.\n\nNewspapers in 1949 time treated the film prize as a major story, because Elle was such an important magazine, and also because the jury for the award was something of a who’s who of women in French arts, literature, and culture. Among the dozen or so members, there was Hélene Gordon-Lazareff, the journalist who had founded Elle; the painter Nora Auric (who was married to composer Georges Auric); Marie-Louise Bousquet, the Paris editor of Harper’s Bazaar as well as being credited with “discovering” Christian Dior; the actresses France Roche and Juliette Verneuil; the journalist, politician, and editor of Elle, Françoise Giroud; and the internationally famous fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli.\n\nAll of the judges met on the rue Beaujolais at the very chic restaurant Véfour (which is still there today) and decided on the inaugural winners. They gave a number of awards, with Jean Simmons winning Best Foreign Actress for Hamlet (1948) and James Mason Best Foreign Actor for Huit heures de surcis (Odd Man Out [1947]). There were also awards in categories that reflected the jurors’ interest in style and fashion. They named Gabrielle Dorziat “the most elegant actress on the stage,” Edwige Feuillère “the most elegant…on the screen,” and Hélène Perdrière as “the most elegant in Paris.” The jurors chose Pierre Fresnay the Best French Actor for his performance in Monsieur Vincent (1947), and Le Miracle de la 34me rue (Miracle on 34th Street [1947]) as the Best Foreign Film, but the big winner in that first ceremony was Jean Cocteau’s Les Parents Terribles (1948). Dorziat won as Best French Actress for her role in the movie, and the film itself was named Best French Film.\n\nCocteau had adapted his film about intense family disfunction from his play of the same name, and it had been understood as a modern, difficult classic as soon as it opened in Paris in December 1948. The film premiered simultaneously in three of the important cinémas d’exclusivité in the city, the Aubert-Palace in the ninth arrondissement, the Gaumont-Théâtre in the second arrondissement, and the Colisée in the eighth, on the Champs-Élysées. Les Parents Terribles left those cinemas after an almost two-month run, opened again soon at several other significant locations, and played fairly steadily throughout Paris and the rest of France. The review of the film in V in 1948 stands out as representative, admiring Cocteau’s vision while unsure whether or not a responsible viewer could fully endorse such a movie. V called Les Parents Terribles “a magnificent transposition of the play, cinematically adapted in the most subtle, intelligent way.” But then the review hedged a bit before a final endorsement, saying that “one can like it or not, but one cannot help but be in awe of the splendid results achieved by Cocteau.”\n\nIn other words, the jurors for Le Prix Féminin awarded a complicated, controversial film. The prizes as a whole, though, demonstrated the broad range of the jurors’ judgements; it’s hard to imagine two films so distinctly different from each other as the sweet, feel-good Miracle de la 34me rue, the Best Foreign Film winner, and Les Parents Terribles.\n\nElle magazine sponsored the awards in 1950 as well, with many of the same jurors but also some new additions, such as the lawyer Suzanne Blum. Alida Valli, Danièle Dejorme, Gregory Peck, and Bernard Blier won the acting awards, and the jurors gave a special prize to the young boy who co-starred in Le Voleur de bicyclette (Ladri de biciclette [1948]), Enzo Staiola. The awards were still a major news story, but this time, some perhaps predictable snarkiness had crept into the reporting.\n\nWriting in L’Aurore in February, 1950, Claude Lazurick-Garson, herself a member of the jury, complained that the prize for Best Foreign Film had been split between Passport to Pimlico (1949) and The Louisiana Story (1948) because of, “by nature, the indecisive feminine sex.” She complained that the women, “tired of being pushed around at Christian Dior’s atelier,” had “refused to award the prize for the best dressed French actress because none of them deserved it.” Some of the jurors had fought hard for Marlene Dietrich in this category, but she “was declared too American,” which Lazurick-Garson thought “curious for a German.” Finally, the reporter/jurist informed readers that Ingrid Bergman had been put forward as a Best Foreign Actress nominee, but one of the judges (perhaps Lazurick-Garson herself) “arose to say that it was not enough to have an illegitimate child to be a big star,” a reference to Bergman’s affair with Italian director Roberto Rosselini and the birth of their son, Renato.\n\nRegardless of any arguments about Dietrich and Bergman, the plan, at least according to Lazurick-Garson, was to have another Prix Féminin the following year. I haven’t found evidence for any such awards for 1951, or any year after that, although this might be because of the scant availability of materials from the 1950s, for example the newspapers that might have reported on the prize. But even if the Prix Féminin lasted only for two years, the award nevertheless marked a significant instance of French film culture. The cinephilia of the period has been well documented, but the record is always a masculinist one. There is Henri Langlois, so important to the ciné-club movement and then as a founder of the Cinèmatheque Française. Then there are the young men at the ciné-clubs during the postwar period and during the first years of Cahiers du Cinèma: Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut first and foremost, both of them under the tutelage of the great historian and theorist André Bazin.\n\nDespite this still powerful mythology, there were also, always, women deeply involved in all aspects of French cinema from the period. Some of them were among the most famous names in French cinema, for instance the filmmaker Germaine Dulac, who was such a tireless champion of ciné-clubs throughout the period. There were also women who are practically unknown today, such as Lucie Derain, who followed Dulac and who was just as much an enthusiastic promoter programmer of the clubs.\n\nIn addition, we have those women who gathered at the restaurant Véfour and who were so important to so many fields—journalism, literature, fashion, politics, law—and who sought to acknowledge the best in cinema. They were the women of the Prix Féminin, who for two years at least, if not more, gave a prize that was understood as being of national importance. Certifying the significance of Cocteau or appreciating the simpler pleasures of Le Miracle de la 34me rue, they asserted the place of women in French film culture, the power of Elle magazine beyond fashion, and their own role as tastemakers and critics equal to the men who have been far better remembered and celebrated in film history.\n\nShe was the “star gone bad” (une star qui a mal tourné). That’s how Le Jour described Mireille Balin on September 30, 1944, just after she had been captured by French police, a month following the liberation of Paris. Le Jour ran an article that day, “What Has Become of Our Stars” (Que sont devenues nos vedettes), now that the Germans were in full retreat. There were the heroic successes. Marlene Dietrich, for instance, would be returning to France from London, to perform for the allied soldiers. There were also heroic tragedies, as in the case of the great actor Harry Baur. His wife was arrested by the Gestapo as a spy and then Baur himself, trying to save her, had been falsely labelled as Jewish by Nazi authorities, who tortured him. Just after his release, Baur died as a result of his treatment by the Germans. Then there were the actresses who began romantic relationships with Nazis. The comedienne Jocelyn Gaël was the worst of them. She had left her husband, actor Jules Berry, for a notorious Gestapo agent stationed in Lyon. But there was also Balin, captured in a cellar in Beausoleil, in the Riviera, where she was in hiding with “her lover,” the German diplomat Biri Desbok.\n\nBefore all that, Balin had been one of the significant stars of French cinema, the “triangle-faced vamp,” as Cinevie described her in 1946, who began making films in 1932. She achieved her greatest success opposite Jean Gabin in Pépé Le Moko (1937), as Gaby, the elegant Parisian who arrives in Algiers, forcing the gangster Pépé to realize everything he has lost during his self-imposed exile in the Casbah. Like many French performers, she continued to work during the German occupation, in such movies as Fromont jeune et Risler aîné (1941) and La femme que j’ai le plus aimée (1942).\n\nHer 1944 arrest was a major news story. All of the reports stressed that authorities found her in a cellar, and emphasized, as L’Echo d’Alger did on October 2, 1944, that she had been there “hiding in the company of a German officer.” They included, as well, the other actresses picked up at around the same time, and for the same reason, for relations with the enemy. As Le Patriote du Sud-Ouest put it, in separate actions the authorities arrested Balin and Gaël, and also Viviane Romance and Gaby Morlay.\n\nLe Patriote expressed the same dismissive scorn towards all of the captured stars, wanting them out of the film industry and hoping that, in twenty years, “in 1964, the community of film actors will be made up of honest women.” Nevertheless, it was a big deal in France when Balin’s new film, La dernière chevauchée, opened in 1947, with the film playing throughout Paris and the rest of the country. Perhaps because Balin finally had been cleared of all charges, the press didn’t condemn her as much as they might have. In December 1944, Ce Soir made the announcement. In an article with news about the latest “purges” (épurations) of collaborationists, which included six executions and two more condemned to death, the newspaper told readers that “Mireille Balin has been freed,” with the judge throwing out the accusations against her.\n\nWhile reviewers liked Balin’s film, they were more muted about the actress herself, regardless of the judge’s decision. Writing about La dernière chevauchée in La Bourgogne Républicaine in August 1947, the critic Jacquemart lamented that “I can’t help but feel that the celebrations on the third anniversary of the Liberation…were a bit premature, when after walking among all of the joyful Parisians at the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville” in the center of the city, “I saw a movie poster with the face of Mireille Balin.”\n\nAround the same time, a relatively subdued reviewer in La Gazette Provençale announced that most of the performances were excellent, “but we are necessarily more reserved about Mireille Balin.” In the runup to the film, other sources floated the story that she had a gambling problem. France-Soir claimed that she was spotted in Monte Carlo losing 50,000 francs a night, adding “that the rumor continued to circulate around her that there was a German officer…whom she would have married,” and that, in fact, she still wore the engagement ring he had given her. Cinévie also reported that she was gambling away most of her fortune at the roulette wheel, and that these losses prompted Balin to make her return to the screen.\n\nThis was nothing, really, compared to the press’ treatment of Jocelyn Gaël. In 1946, Combat reported that she had been found guilty of being an “unworthy” and “hit with a twenty-year exile from Paris.” She was back in the news a year later, when she sued the Free French forces for having stolen millions of francs worth of jewelry from her. In covering that story, Combat reminded readers that she had been condemned as a “national degradation,” and the newspaper groused that the hat she wore at the proceedings was unfashionable. Combat had special contempt for her husband, Jules Berry, who accompanied her in court. He was, after all, the man she had thrown over for a German, and who then had been only too happy to come back to her, “smiling and shrugging casually” during the hearing. The jewels, finally, were returned to Gaël, and Combat complained that the judge in the case had to apologize to the actress, telling her that “we are sorry to have disturbed you unnecessarily.”\n\nThe difference in attitude may have been understandable. Newspapers made it clear that Balin’s relationship had been with a German cosmopolitan, Gaël’s with a Gestapo murderer. But Balin’s career never recovered, and La dernière chevauchée, which came out when she was 39, was her final film. She turned up now and then in the news after that, for instance in 1951 when a reporter for V spotted her at the Cannes film festival. He saw her in the company of the Aga Khan as well as the Monarch of Tonkin, Bao Dai, and also with another of the stars arrested in 1944, Viviane Romance. So this, perhaps, marked at least something of a rehabilitation of the reputations of both women.\n\nReally, though, throughout the 1950s and ‘60s she was hardly ever in the news, if we can trust the available sources, which are far fewer than for previous decades. Balin died in 1968, at 59. There were, no doubt, many obituaries, many of them probably extensive. But the only one accessible, at least to the researcher in the United States, is as brief as an obituary can be, even for a faded celebrity. The Journal d’Année for 1968 announced all of the prominent deaths for that year. There was Emmanuel d’Astier de la Vigerie, for instance, “the former editor of Libération,” followed alphabetically by Professeur Jean Baby, “a Marxist theorist.” Then, after Baby, there was Balin, “a film actress, on November 8, 1968, in Paris.”\n\n“Cartier, the famous jeweler, has just put bracelets into production, each with eight gold or silver charms that represent Blanche Neige et les Sept Nains.” That was how the French newspaper L’Intransigeant, in April 1938, described one of the more sophisticated merchandise tie-ins with Walt Disney’s first feature-length cartoon. Blanche Neige (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs [1937]) had just opened in Paris at the very fashionable Marignan cinema on the avenue des Champs-Élysées in the eighth arrondissement. The film was an immediate sensation, in the French capital, the rest of the country, and also in French North Africa. When the film opened in Algiers, for example, at the Régent cinema in November 1938, it was acknowledged as the cultural event of the year, and newspaper advertisements began a full week in advance, an unheard of publicity campaign at the time. In fact, depending on how we measure such things, Blanche Neige may still be the greatest international hit in film history; it is certainly the greatest such hit that was also instantly acknowledged as a spectacular artistic achievement. From the same period, perhaps only À l’Ouest rien de nouveau (All Quiet on the Western Front [1930]) might compete in terms of world box office and the assumption on the part of critics and intellectuals of its aesthetic achievement.\n\nAt the time, Disney’s film was also the most heavily merchandised film in history, and certainly in France. There had been other products connected to films there, many of them also made by Disney. But other films, too, had been connected to a variety of items, and often films that might not seem, at first glance, to have much to offer in terms of consumer goods.\n\nLeontine Sagan’s 1931 film, for example, Mädchen in Uniform, entered the art film canon decades ago. But it was also a huge commercial hit, in France and elsewhere in Europe. Always hoping to capitalize on such things, merchandisers linked themselves to this very serious film about a militarized girls’ school. The women’s magazine La Femme de France told readers in January,1934, that they, too, could now buy the austere dresses that the girls in the film wore as daily uniforms, with “their two white pockets and small white cuffs” (although it’s unclear whether Sagan, or anyone connected to the film, ever made any money from these sales).\n\nThere had been nothing, though, like Blanche Neige, in terms of the products associated with it or the general interest the film elicited. There was plenty of merchandise aimed directly at French kids. In its Christmas issue for 1938, the magazine Regards ran an article, “Snow White, Donald Duck, and Aerodynamic Trains have Replaced the Toys of Yesterday,” accompanied by photos of a Blanche Neige doll and Seven Dwarf figurines. But Blanche Neige products, in France and probably elsewhere, crossed age lines, as well as those of class and gender, with many of them directed towards very fashionable women.\n\nIn addition to the Cartier bracelets that were linked to the movie, the fashion house Colcombet, one of the major such ateliers in France, introduced a new dress in 1938 with images of Blanche Neige throughout and buttons shaped like the seven dwarfs. This was no novelty item. Instead, it was understood as a significant addition to that season’s fashion. The dress was advertised in Ciné-France, as a design indebted to “the father of Mickey Mouse,” and it also made an appearance in one of the significant haute-couture women’s magazines of the period, Femina, in July 1938. Along with drawings of the latest maillots for summers on the beach, photos of models wearing short robes as well as “costumes inspired by China,” an article about the necessity of changing one’s perfume and another about “the mysteries of India,” Femina praised the Colcombet Blanche Neige design as “a charming robe with a peacock-blue vest.” A drawing of the dress shared the page with a new bolero, a chic sweater, and a pleated skirt.\n\nThe daily press, and the film journals in particular, in addition to stressing the merchandise linked to the film also emphasized Blanche Neige as a technological triumph unlike any film that had come before. In April 1938, for example, Pour Vous ran an extended piece on “How Walt Disney and his 500 Collaborators Brought Snow White, and Her Friends the Seven Dwarfs, to Life.” Along with an explanation of the army of people required to make the film, there were photos of the artists at work, of the technicians operating the “$75,000 multiplane camera,” and the inkers and painters, all of them women, who brought color to the film. There may have been products associated with Blanche Neige, but the article made clear that the film itself was the greatest product of all.\n\nYet another women’s magazine, Noveauté, told readers all about the film in April 1939, as Blanche Neige continued its extended run through Paris and the rest of France. The story detailed Walt Disney generally as well as Mickey Mouse, “the most famous and best paid star” in the world. But Nouveaté also emphasized the importance of fairy tales to Disney animation, and in particular Blanche Neige as well as Pinocchio, currently in production, and the two films were used to explain how cartoons were made. There was no assumption here that French mothers might be convinced to take their kids to see Blanche Neige after reading about it in the magazine. Rather, the article in Nouveauté, as well as those in other women’s journals, seemed to indicate that nos lectrices, as the women readers were addressed, would be as interested in Blanche Neige as anyone else, and as eager to find out exactly how it was made.\n\nIndeed, this was the marvel of Blanche Neige, in France as well as everywhere else it played. The film was understood as that rarest of all Hollywood products, perfect for everyone, regardless of age or gender or class. Children might want the Blanche Neige doll while women would be interested in the high fashion that came from the film, and everyone would go to see the movie, perhaps more than once. There appears to have been no criticism of the manner in which Disney merchandised the film. Instead, all of the dolls and dresses seemed only to underscore the importance of Blanche Neige, with the figurines and fashion indicating the modernity of the movie, the possibilities of the film to appeal to everyone, at the cinema as well as in the home.\n\nIn an issue from May 1938 that included a review of Jean Renoir’s great film, La Grande Illusion (1937), the visual arts journal L’Image extolled the consummate skill of all of the workers at Disney who had designed such a perfect entertainment as well as so many perfect products. This was several years before the bitter strike of Disney animators in 1941 and ‘42 which would expose some of the harsher conditions that Walt had imposed. Instead, for L’Image, Blanche Neige was the proof that, “in Hollywood, Disney has formed the ideal studio.” As the magazine Regards put it, in that article about Christmas gifts, Blanche Neige was the sign of an exquisite balance between old and new, between sophistication and credulity. All of those Blanche Neige toys, after all, were perfect for the “modern” tastes of French children, who, “nevertheless, could not stop believing in Santa Claus.”\n\nGerman cultural critic Siegfired Kracauer was relentlessly grouchy about “The Little Shop Girls Who Go to the Movies.” That was the collective title of his 1927 series of essays about what he considered the idiocy of popular films at the time. For Kracauer, those shop girls typified the audience—and especially the female audience–for the soporific stuff from Hollywood, France, and a few other countries, the movies that repeated themselves again and again, providing the masses with mindless melodramas and comedies.\n\nKracauer was right in noting that “shop girls”—those working-class women in the clothing industry, mostly in Paris in the French context—loved going to the movies. But their investment in culture and politics was much more complex than Kracauer might have wanted to acknowledge. When they weren’t at the movies, shop girls were often in the streets, on strike and demanding more pay and better working conditions. When they were at the movies and also engaging in a broad range of film culture, their taste and personal investments were not as unsophisticated as many intellectuals, Kracauer among them, believed.\n\nIn France, the term for shop girl was midinette. And, in fact, between 1926 and 1939, a weekly publication took that name to address these women directly, with stories and news and cartoons designed for them, and with a significant amount of reporting about the movies.\n\nThe first Midinette currently available appeared in August 1934, and it set the template for the issues that followed. The great French-American soprano and actress Lily Pons appeared on the cover of the premiere issue, and every Midinette after that featured a cover photo of a female movie star, usually American or French. These were all classic glamor portraits, and often the performer gazed straight out at the reader, very possibly a midinette herself. In the November 2, 1934 edition, for instance, Heather Angel applies lipstick as she looks right at the reader, who doubles as a sort of vanity mirror for the star. A few months later, in an issue from July, Ann Harding cradles her face in her hand, staring at whoever might have picked up the magazine. No matter where she looked, an extraordinarily popular actress was a constant cover feature—Barbara Stanwyck (August 10, 1934), Kay Francis (October 19, 1934), Mae West (January 4, 1935), and also the greatest of all French stars, Danielle Darrieux (February 1, 1935). The publishers of Midinette understood the fascination that female fans felt for the women who appeared in the movies, a fascination that, decades later, Jackie Stacey examined in her groundbreaking 1993 work, Star-Gazing: Hollywood Cinema and Female Spectatorship.\n\nThe issues hardly varied one from the other, and we can choose a representative Midinette randomly, in this case the issue from November 23, 1934. Carole Lombard appeared on the cover, and just inside there was a full-page personals column, jammed with items about jobs and events as well as relationship requests, for instance this one: “Young man, 19 years old, student, living in Africa, desires correspondence with charming shop girls, from 18 to 21-years old, who love life, sports, dancing, with a photo if possible.” Midinette also included a few cartoons, often just slightly racy (First woman: “Why are you flirting with that man if you hate him so much?” Second woman: “Because I hate his wife even more.”) The magazine that week included a few chapters of a new novel by the French crime and mystery writer Max-André Dazergues, as well as a crossword and a few other games, the music and lyrics to a song, Les Caresses, and a funny short story in a regular column, “Life in Laughter” (La Vie en riant).\n\nAs always, there was also a lot about the movies. Midinette ran an appreciation of the woman on the cover, as they always would (“Carole Lombard is one of those rare artists who has maintained in sound cinema the stardom she had attained in silent film”). A new Shirley Temple film was opening at the time, and so the magazine ran a short story based on La Petite Shirley (Baby Take a Bow [1934]), with photos from the movie. Then there was a profile of romantic leading man Hardy Kruger, Un grand seducteur—le Roméo d’Hollywood.\n\nMidinette ran a range of what we might call middlebrow literature, along the lines of the Dazergues novel. There would be other novels, like Paul Darcy’s Les Promesses du bonheur, and some non-fiction that might have surprised Kracauer, for instance a biography of the great French writer Alexandre Dumas in the issue from March 6, 1936. Readers could also find much lighter stuff, material that we might still read today in magazines like Midinette. The issue from December 20, 1935, ran “Which Nose is Yours?” about judging personality types through various nose shapes, and a few months later, in February 1936, a graphologist weighed in on handwriting, in “How Do You Sign Your Name?” Most issues emphasized romance, with a story, for instance, about “Those Immortal Lovers—Antony and Cleopatra” (January 4, 1935), or, in an example from an ongoing series, “The Great Lovers,” a look at the romances of Werther in the September 6, 1935 issue. Leading in to that story, and suggesting a wide range of cultural interests on the part of the readers of Midinette, the magazine’s editors said, “Here is a familiar name to all of our ladies, especially because he has been celebrated in an opera by one of our most famous composers,” a reference to the work by Jules Massenet, itself a version of Goethe’s novel.\n\nAlways, Midinette emphasized the movies. Every issue ran a story of a film, and while many of them might have been forgettable, and perhaps justified Kracauer’s disdain, others were far more interesting, and indicate the breadth of interest among shop girls. The issue from May 24, 1935, told readers about Frank Capra’s banking melodrama, “La Ruée (American Madness [1932]), while a few months before, in November 1934, Midinette featured Julien Duvivier’s Le Paquebot Tenacity (1934), and in March 1935, the magazinehighlighted Josephine Baker’s ZouZou (1935). By the mid-1930s, the Russian-French filmmaker Dimitri Kirsanoff had established himself as an important avant-garde, impressionist filmmaker, particularly with his great film Ménilmontant (1926). The editors of Midinette must have felt that little shop girls were as intrigued by his movies as the French intelligentsia, and so published the story of his film Rapt in the issue of January 4, 1935.\n\nAlong with these literary versions of new films, Midinette ran features about stars—“The Enigmatic John Boles” in the September 28, 1934 issue, for instance—and lots of fluff pieces about them, as well—“The Stars’ Honeymoons,” in November, 1934, featuring Frances Dee, Cary Grant, and Jean Harlow, as well as a piece in October 1934 about the various stage and screen actresses who had played Madame DuBarry, Pola Negri among them, and for whom the role had brought only bad luck.\n\nAll of this, then, formed the reading, and seemed to reflect the tastes and interests, of the little shop girls, the midinettes of France. Kracauer wrote his disparaging articles about a year after Midinette began publication, but it’s doubtful that he ever consulted the magazine, or that it would have changed his opinion if he had. Even the magazine itself doesn’t give us absolute proof of what its presumed audience may have thought or believed. But Midinette, by so directly invoking those shop girls in its very title, certainly gives us reason to believe that this was a complicated audience, and the contempt that Kracauer felt for them tells us much more about himself, perhaps, than about all of those working girls who loved going to the movies and reading about them.\n\n“When he said, ‘I must go back to Paris, I must,’ Boyer seemed to exhale his own regret…When, maddened with despair, he descended the winding stairs of the Casbah, I had the feeling that one of our most important actors was fleeing the California studios and returning to his country, irresistibly recalled by his native land.” That was screenwriter and director Serge Véber, writing in Pour Vous in September 1938, recording his response to watching the French actor Charles Boyer in Casbah (Algiers [1938]), an American remake of one of the great French films of the decade, Pépe le Moko (1937). But then Véber realized that he must be wrong, and his “illusion was brief,” because he “remembered…that Boyer is very happy” in Hollywood, “that he has made his life there…that he loves the climate, his wife, his tennis, his swimming pool.” Boyer as Pépe, the role that had been originated by perhaps the decade’s most popular French actor, Jean Gabin, was a sure sign of betrayal, Boyer’s, of course, and also Hollywood’s, taking something so quintessentially French and making it fully American.\n\nOne month later, Pour Vous ran a funny, fictional column about a young Parisian girl who “ran” to see Casbah, “because Charles Boyer’s name was emblazoned on the marquee.” She wasn’t completely disappointed, but still, “she found the idea of the Americans trying to outdo Pépé le Moko funny.” A week after that, the same journal published a letter by a furious fan, “absolutely disgusted” with Casbah, and who asked, echoing Véber, “Is Boyer forever lost to French cinema?”\n\nCertainly the response to Casbah wasn’t all bad. Boyer had been extraordinarily popular in France for several years, from films like Mayerling (1936), in which he shared billing with perhaps the greatest of all French stars, Danielle Darrieux. When he left the country for Hollywood, his fans seemed to stay with him, making David O. Selznick’s production of The Garden of Allah (1936) a very big hit in France (helped, of course, by Boyer’s costar, Marlene Dietrich, who at the time was a far bigger celebrity in France than in the United States). But Casbah was different, mostly because Pépé le Moko had been different, too, a colonial fantasy that nevertheless marked the possibility of a French cinema equal to any in the world, and a film that made Gabin a celebrity throughout Europe, North Africa, and Indochina.\n\nDirected by one of the country’s most well-known filmmakers, Julien Duvivier, Pépé le Moko opened in Paris at the end of January 1937, at the Marivaux cinema. Located in the fashionable second arrondissement, the Marivaux was one of several of the city’s most important cinémas d’exclusivite on the boulevard des Italiens, a main location for major exhibition sites showing the newest, most significant films. A filmgoer might walk down the block and see movies at the Olympia, the Capucines, the American-owned Paramount, the Imperial Pathé, and the Aubert-Palace, as well as several others including the Marivaux, and it would not be uncommon for films to play at these sites for extended periods. At the Marivaux, for instance, before Pépé le Moko, Le Roi (1936) screened for almost three months. That film featured the great Raimu, one of the most famous and popular of all French performers—he had starred in the Marcel Pagnol trilogy Marius (1931), Fanny (1932), and César (1936)—who represented a more aged, heavier form of masculinity than the much younger, world weary Gabin.\n\nPépé le Moko played at the Marivaux week after week, until early-April 1937, and there was steady news about the film, much of it in Pour Vous. In February 1937, well into the film’s run, there was an article about the astonishing amount of positive mail the journal had received about Gabin’s movie. A week later, Pour Vous published a series of reviews of the film from various sources, all of them positive, including one that said, “Gabin is perfect” in his role. Two weeks later, in an article, “Women and Bad Boys” (Les femmes et les mauvais garçons), Blanche Vogt wrote that all of the women who see the film “fall in love” with the gangster Pépé.\n\nAfter it left the Marivaux, Pépé le Moko returned to Parisian cinemas again and again. There was a reprise of the film, for instance, a year-and-a-half following its initial release; it played at the Ciné Paris-Soir in the eleventh arrondissement that October, and a few weeks later Pépé showed at the Cinéma Pernetty in the fourteenth, and then kept moving throughout the city after that. But, really, Pépé le Moko always seemed to be showing somewhere in Paris, as well as the rest of France, until the German occupation that began in June 1940, a sign of the incredible popularity of both the film and its star.\n\nPépé le Moko wouldn’t play in the United States until February 1941. The New York Times reported that the American premiere would take place at the World Theatre in New York, with all proceeds aiding the “Free French in England and Africa,” under the auspices of “France Forever, a de Gaulle war relief organization.” In the United States, then, before it had ever been seen, the film seems to have been understood as absolutely French, the perfect movie to help the Resistance. Perhaps because American audiences had to wait so long to see the film, a 1938 Hollywood remake made good sense. But Casbah was also produced as an international film, ideal for audiences in France and the rest of Europe. There was Boyer, of course, who around the same time as Pépé le Moko’s opening run in Paris in 1937 had had a big hit in Paris, co-starring with Greta Garbo in MGM’s historical melodrama, Marie Walewska [Conquest]. Casbah also benefitted from another star, Sigrid Gurie, a Norwegian actress who was more popular in Europe than the United States. In fact, in discussing the remake, L’Intransigeant insisted, perhaps disparagingly, that with Pépé le Moko, “the hero was the most important character,” but in the remake, Gurie, “recently discovered by Hollywood,” was “far more significant.”\n\nIt also didn’t hurt that the film featured Hedy Lamarr in her Hollywood debut. Lamarr had caused a sensation in France, and, really, the rest of Europe, with her role in Extase (1933). That film had an extended run in Paris at the Théâtre Pigalle in the ninth arrondissement, and then became a staple of the city’s ciné-clubs, with audiences drawn in by the movie’s frank sexuality as well as Lamarr’s nude swimming scene. French newspapers reported on her frequently, with Paris-Soir noting her appearance in the new version of Pépé le Moko in September 1938, and comparing her to the greatest of all movie stars with the headline, “Will Hedy Lamarr Eclipse Greta Garbo?” In other words, with Boyer, Gurie, and Lamarr, Casbah was very much produced as a multi-national commodity, one that might find more audiences in Europe than the United States.\n\nCasbah opened in Paris in mid-September 1938, at the fashionable César cinema on the Champs-Elysées in the eighth arrondissement. The site itself was a sign of the importance of the film, which played there for about a month, a perfectly respectable first-run for any film. Casbah would move out to other cinemas in the city, often playing the same week as the ubiquitous Pépé le Moko, for instance in January 1939, when Boyer’s film showed at the Gaité-Clichy in the seventeenth arrondissement while Gabin’s screened at Le Riquet in the nineteenth. Boyer himself returned to French film only sparingly, in 1939, for instance, in Marc Allégret’s Le Corsaire, and then not again until 1953 and Max Ophüls masterpiece, Madame de.. He came back once more, twenty years later, in another great film, Alain Resnais’ Stavisky (1974). Given the place of those latter two films in the French film canon, Serge Véber may have been too harsh on Boyer so many years earlier, after that screening of Casbah, when he accused the actor of abandoning his home country’s cinema. But Casbah certainly marked the end of the fully French phase of Boyer’s career, when he might have challenged Gabin’s stardom, and the beginning of the actor’s Hollywood celebrity, which left so many French audiences still drawn to him, but also disappointed in the choice that he had made.\n\nThe future of French cinema began early. The first reference I’ve found in film journalism to l’avenir du cinéma appeared in November 1913, in an issue of Excelsior, a daily illustrated journal. In the article “The Cinema Versus the Theatre,” various experts weighed in, including the director Jean Benoît-Levy and producer Louis Aubert. The studio mogul Léon Gaumont also offered his opinion, claiming that it was “an error to believe that the cinema poses a danger to the theatre, because I see quite clearly in the future that the cinema will serve as an accessory to the stage.”\n\nLess than two months later, in early-January 1914, the cinema did seem to pose a threat. An article in Ciné-Journal exclaimed that one of the reasons for “the glorious future of the cinema is that it will practically abolish the differences in price and class” that had always been emphasized by the theatre. At the movies, spectators could sit anywhere for the same price, “in the orchestra or the balcony,” something unheard of at the legitimate stage, where “the poor and humble might be” allowed to pay a pittance and sit in the worst seats “out of tolerance.” Then, in 1917, Ciné-Journal took on the subject again, this time insisting that the future of cinema needed to be marked by administrative and legal changes. France’s dense popular culture bureaucracy deemed the movies no different from marionette shows and other spectacles de curiosité, with this humiliating classification allowing for too much state interference and control. Instead, cinema required the same status as the theatre, concerts, and the opera in order to achieve its full potential. Ciné Journal asserted, dramatically, that “the future of cinema depends on it.”\n\nAt least for the next thirty years, discussions of the future of cinema persisted, with the same lack of consensus that we see in these pieces from the period before 1920. Most frequently, discussions of the future meant considerations of quality, either improving or declining, sometimes seemingly at once. In 1920, Les Annales Politiques et Littéraires asked two experts, who disagreed absolutely. The actor Gabriel Signoret insisted that “the cinema is at the beginning of an era of perfection,” while filmmaker André Antoine huffed that “the French film is starting to die,” because all of the country’s films were “ridiculous,” while the great film companies were “uninterested in art.”\n\nNaturally enough, the development of recorded sound in cinema made the possibilities for the future even more interesting and urgent. In 1930, the very highbrow Mercure de France, a bi-monthly journal of literature and the arts, devoted a fifty-page article, Avenir du Cinéma, to the subject, which began by asserting the vital importance of an examination of the future of the movies: “The sound cinema has just appeared,” requiring a reconsideration of everything intellectuals had thought they knew about the medium.\n\nA few of the people thinking about such things were less than optimistic about the new technology. Writing in La Revue Française Politique in 1929, for instance, the literary critic Emile Magne claimed that the “future of cinema appears immense,” largely because “literature and theatre have not evolved with the modern world.” But Magne was cautionary as well, fearing that the universal language of silent cinema, perfected by Charles Chaplin, would now be lost to the world.\n\nThere were also concerns about the future that were more commercial than philosophical.In April 1932, the Osso film company ran an advertisement in La Critique Cinématogoraphique, attesting to the quality of eighteen of the studio’s recent films. All of them were the result of “great energy…meticulous choices in screenwriters, actors, and directors,” and also because of Osso’s great industrial organization. Those films included Marcel L’Herbier’s Le Mystère de la chambre jaune [1930], as well as great starring vehicles for Albert Préjean (Un soir de Rafle [1931]) and Suzy Vernon and Ivan Mosjoukine (Le Sergent X [1932]). Osso asked why the company had devoted such time, effort, and money on these films, and then answered their own question: Because “these are the indispensable elements for the future of French sound cinema,” with this film studio more than any other safeguarding the ongoing quality of the country’s motion pictures.\n\nOther film studios also saw the commercial prospects of emphasizing the future. A few years before Osso, in 1928, Franco Films organized a “star contest” guaranteed to “influence the future of cinema.” The competition, taking place in Nice, included 200 hopefuls. A jury would select fifteen, all guaranteed to appear in films made by the studio, and all with the possibility of becoming the first new stars of the French sound cinema.\n\nOver the next ten years, a who’s who of French and international cinema entered the debate, with the press eager to print what these luminaries predicted for the future. In 1933, for instance, director Jacques Feyder told Paris-Soir that the French motion picture industry had tried too hard to standardize its product, and that “the future of cinema” depended on “atmospheric films, costume films,” and historical dramas, rather than on cookie-cutter contemporary melodramas and comedies. In fact, to set an example for other filmmakers, Feyder said that his “next film will be a historical film,” probably referring to La Kermesse héroique (1935), about the sixteenth century Spanish invasion of the Netherlands.\n\nSome experts may not have seen the future in terms of historical epics, but they agreed with Feyder’s main point about the industry. Screenwriter Alexandre Arnoux insisted to Le Figaro in October, 1935, that to guarantee the future of French cinema, “we must reorganize the motion picture industry at the point of production.” He went on that “French filmmakers must act like book editors,” and that “competent, literary people should read novels, plays, and screenplays, and recommend them to producers,” with this model based on great works from other media perhaps not unexpected from someone who had just written a film adaptation of the Cervantes novel, Don Quichotte (1933).\n\nThe film tabloid Pour Vous always gave a great deal of attention to the future, running articles about it every year or two. In July, 1935, the journal published opinions by some of the most significant American filmmakers, Charles Chaplin, Walt Disney, David O. Selznick, and Mary Pickford. Chaplin believed that economic conditions in general would improve, and that companies like United Artists, the firm he had co-founded to allow filmmakers, rather than major studios, to control their own movies, marked the true future of cinema. Mary Pickford, one of Chaplin’s partners in UA, agreed, and also discussed her own future, and her move into producing movies in which she herself did not appear. Selznick, another independent producer, also extolled his and UA’s model of filmmaking, while Disney, always a technological innovator and early-adopter, appropriately enough talked about the significance of color to the future of movies.\n\nPour Vous took these discussions seriously, but the tabloid was always willing to poke fun at itself. In 1934 the editors went to the psychic Madame Fraya, and then headlined that she “Spoke to Us About the Future of Cinema.” She looked at photos of ingenues and predicted stardom for Magdeleine Ozeray, Josseline Gaël, and Jacqueline Francell (Fraya may have been having an off-day; all of them had reasonable careers but were hardly important stars). Then, as something of an afterthought, she predicted that the future would see fewer literary adaptations.\n\nOver the years, other experts gave their opinions, but hardly with much accuracy. In 1935 in Le Figaro, the writer Pierre Mac Orlan predicted that France, with all of its great filmmakers and performers, would become the greatest country in the world for film. Twelve years later, in March 1947 in Cinévie, and at least according to the filmmakers consulted, Mac Orlan’s prediction was still far from coming true. Marcel Carné told the magazine that “the future for directors is somber.” Jacques Becker felt that the only way to compete with the dominant American cinema was for French companies to buy exhibition sites in the US and show French films in them. The director Henri Decoin believed that the French cinema needed a single, guiding figure, a “Minister of Cinema,” to lead the industry into the future, while Marcel L’Herbier saw “the future of French cinema” as a “struggle between technique and aesthetics,” and then added, obliquely, that this would be “as desirable as it is dreadful.”\n\nOf course, in 1947, the “future” of French cinema, at least in terms of international recognition, was really just a few years away. Nevertheless, none of those who spoke to any of the journals anticipated the seemingly sudden infusion of excitement and innovation brought by Agnès Varda, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and the other filmmakers of the New Wave of the 1950s. Now, seventy years later, that “future” might seem far more predictable, given the exigencies of the post-World War Two French economy, new filmmaking technologies, the creation of journals like Cahiers du Cinéma, and developments in the ciné-club movement that fostered so many young writers and directors. But the “experts” in the late-1940s, as well as those before them, seemed to have no idea what was coming, with a respected writer like Mac Orlan and a great director like Becker having no better sense of things than the psychic Madame Fraya.\n\n“Often, in my brief uncertainty about where I was, I did not distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed any better than we isolate, when we see a horse run, the successive positions shown to us by a kinetoscope.” This is how the narrator at the beginning of Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time described waking up, often unsure just where he was, or what year it might be, perhaps as a young boy at his grandfather’s house, possibly decades later at Madame de Saint-Loup’s. More precisely, this is Swann’s Way, the first volume of Proust’s work,in its 2004 English translation by Lydia Davis. The earlier, once authoritative version, by C.K. Scott Moncrief, inexplicably translated the French kinetoscope into “bioscope,” a more general term covering a range of viewing options rather than the specific name for the Thomas Edison machine meant for individual viewers. Most sources indicate that Proust had little interest in the cinema, but he certainly seems to have been aware of some of the earliest motion pictures, so often showing galloping horses, and of the particular technology for showing them that first came to France in the mid-1890s, when the author would have been in his twenties.\n\nI have not read all of In Search of Lost Time, but my sense is that there are not many references to cinema in it. This might be the only one, followed just a few pages later by a magic lantern, projecting fairy tale scenes onto his bedroom wall, that terrified the narrator as a young boy. I’m also not sure there is any evidence that Proust ever went to a cinema, even though there were lots of them near the very fashionable boulevard Haussmann, where he moved in 1906, living there until just a few years before he died in November 1922. In spite of this, and mostly after his death, Proust did have a significant place in French film culture, as a reference point for the critics and intellectuals who wrote about movies as well as for the public that was so interested in them, in the people who made films and the stars who appeared in them.\n\nThe earliest mention I’ve found to Proust and the movies comes from January 1922. Writing in La Vie des Lettres, the philosopher Jean Grenier explained that, in Proust’s style, there was a linkage to “the processes of cinema, particularly slow-motion cinema, which decomposes all movements.” Allusions like this one became common in the period’s writing about Proust, that this most modern of all novelists wrote “cinematically,” in a style that brought to mind the most modern of all the arts.\n\nAt least for the next ten years, literary scholars maintained this notion of Proust, cinema, and slow-motion. In 1932, for example, in La Grande Revue, Georges Buraud wrote about the new sense of time and space provided by film, explaining that “speed and slowness become arbitrary and most often interchangeable sensations through the cinema,” and that as a result, the motion picture “certainly belongs to the century of Proust’s psychology, of Einstein’s physics” as fully modern phenomena. Two years earlier in the same journal, Gaston Pagès wrote that, time, in the cinema, is “not that of reality, and not that of the spectator, either,” and that, instead, “in the manner of Proust, there is a time lost and a time found.”\n\nReferences to Proust and cinema were not just the province of the intellectual periodicals of the period. Rather, they appeared, as well, in the sources consumed casually by a wide range of readers. Marianne was a literary and cultural weekly, but hardly on the level of La Grande Revue, and in 1934 it may have been the first source to report that Proust himself never went to the movies. In fact, he “performed none of those little actions” that so many of us enjoy, staying in his apartment and writing instead. “Marcel Proust,” Marianne insisted, “did not use the telephone, and never went to the theatre, much less the cinema.”\n\nProust might also be used as both an aspiration for the movies and as a shortcoming. In March 1935, the country’s leading women’s magazine, La Femme de France, complained that the contemporary French cinema hovered uncomfortably between vaudeville and melodrama, and no filmmaker would dream of taking the risk of adapting the novels of François Mauriac or Proust. Meanwhile, French critics, producers, and directors typically mocked the American cinema, for being “purely commercial.” But at least in Hollywood, according to La Femme de France, filmmakers would take on adaptations of the novels of Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis, a sign of the superior seriousness of American motion pictures.\n\nWith some filmmakers, though, Proust could indicate a problem. In April 1929, the weekly film tabloid Pour Vous ran a profile of the director G.W. Pabst, who had, for a long time, been popular in France among “average” filmgoers as well cinephiles. Pabst’s great film Loulou (Pandora’s Box [1929]) had recently opened in Paris to rave reviews, but Pour Vous warned readers that Pabst, nevertheless, sometimes took himself a little too seriously, “like a somewhat forced Proust…preoccupied with art.”\n\nFour years later, in 1933, Pour Vous announced the formation of a new film studio, the Nouvelle Société des films, associated with the literary journal Nouvelle Revue Française. Audiences in search of serious films perhaps would expect adaptations of the most important French novels, but the new head of the studio insisted, emphatically, “No!” and then added, “Those who expect us to make films from Marcel Proust will be disappointed,” because his works would never be popular with the general public. The new company planned a film version of Madame Bovary, but they would take no chances with a more modern novel.\n\nProust also entered into discussions of movie stars of the period. In a 1934 profile of Meg Lemonnier, the chanteuse who would make films now and again, Bernard Lelou in Pour Vous gushed that she “talks about her flowers with the same enthusiasm as Marcel Proust describing the hawthorns of Combray,” a sure sign of the actress’ delicacy and breeding. But Proust also indicated the excesses of some stars, who would invoke his pages-long sentences without any appreciation of his consummate skill. In 1936, for instance, another Pour Vous piece, about the mindlessness of so many performers, claimed that they had “burnt brains” best suited for “ridiculous bets, such as eating twelve hard-boiled eggs without drinking, or reading one of Marcel Proust’s sentences without breathing.” Pour Vous seems to have invoked the author more than any other film journal, and for a variety of reasons. A 1936 article about Clark Gable told readers how friendly and down to earth he was, and that “we could hit him vigorously on the shoulder and say, ‘Hiya, Clark.” Doubling down on the star’s masculine appeal, the article assured readers that, while “we might make a few discreet allusions to Shakespeare” with Gable, his friends would never “talk about Marcel Proust or André Gide,” a probable reference to the authors’ homosexuality, which would have been known to many of the tabloid’s readers.\n\nMore often than not, though, film journalists invoked Proust to indicate quality, and something of the essence of French cinema. When Julien Duvivier’s great 1937 film, Un carnet de bal, proved to be an international hit, Pour Vous raved that critics in New York, in writing about the film, “cited the names of Balzac, Proust, and Molière.” Indeed, what was true of Duvivier’s film might be true for cinema in general. Years earlier, in 1924, the Revue Bleu referred to the modern age as “the epoch of the microscope and the cinema,” the two modes par excellence for looking closely at the world around us. The article began by citing Proust, as a means of describing the films and the novels of the post-World War One era. “The original artist,” Proust claimed, when finished with any work, says to us, “Look now,” and then, “here is the world…entirely different from anything before it, but also perfectly clear.”\n\n“Plus de Nègres!” That was the headline in the September 1, 1940 issue of the French liberationist newspaper, France. “No more negroes,” although many in France at the time would understand nègres as a much more offensive and insulting term. The article explained that this was the new rule of the fascist Vichy government in the southern half of France, and then, summing things up, informed readers that those in power “no longer wanted to see or hear Josephine Baker.” Now representing, in this instance, all Afro-Français, Baker of course was the great African American performer and expat, one of the most important stars of pre-World War Two Paris, as well as the rest of the country and French North Africa.\n\nAt this time, the German occupation of much of France was still fairly new. But Baker clearly had already become a powerful symbol of resistance to the Nazi authorities. There were other major stars who kept performing in Paris and elsewhere in France during the occupation, Edith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier, for instance. Similarly, Jean Cocteau among many other artists didn’t hesitate to socialize with the Nazis in Paris. Some, like the great actor Sessue Hayakawa, kept appearing at Parisian social events with Germans, and then later claimed to have been active in the French Resistance, although evidence can be difficult to come by. But Baker was the real thing. She very publicly asserted that she would never perform in France as long as the Germans were there, and by the time that article appeared in France she had begun her career as an actual Resistance agent. In 1957, the French government presented the country’s highest award to her, the Légion d’Honneur, for this clandestine wartime work, which also has been well chronicled in various biographies, most recently in the overheated, but still useful, Agent Josephine: American Beauty, French Hero, British Spy, by Damien Lewis.\n\nBut what kind of presence, exactly, did Baker have in France during the war, and particularly in Paris? In fact, she performed once in France while the Germans controlled the country, fairly early on. After leaving Paris when the Occupation began, Baker played the title role in Jacques Offenbach’s operetta La Créole in Marseille, in December 1940. According to Lewis, she did so to help a friend, Fred Rey, who would co-produce the show and dance in it, and who was already a Nazi target in need money to get out of the country. It also helped that a port city like Marseille was a perfect place for gathering intelligence, and it would be a convenient stop before Baker decamped to North Africa, where she spent most of the war, for more espionage work. Predictably, La Créole was a very big hit, even making front-page news in Paris. Baker had been a sensation in the same show in 1934, and Le Jour headlined that this revival marked the triumphant “return of the bird of paradise,” a reference to the character Baker would play and also to Baker herself, always exoticized by the French press.\n\nBaker’s arrival in Algiers, after the success of La Créole in Marseille, made front-page news in L’Echo d’Alger in January 1941. In his book, Lewis claims that most of the high-ranking officials involved in the war passed through Casablanca or Marrakesh, the two places where Baker spent most of her time, and many of them, fascists or fascist sympathizers, were eager to meet the famous and apparently apolitical star. What better place, then, for Baker to gather intelligence, and then pass it along to British agents and the French resistance?\n\nBaker performed steadily in Algiers. In just a few examples of the many appearances that were fully reported in the city’s newspapers, she starred in a stage show at the Colisée cinema in June 1941 and returned there two years later, she was the headliner at a Free French gala in honor of Charles DeGaulle at the Opéra d’Alger in August 1941, and she was a constant presence at a variety of charitable fundraisers.\n\nHer record of appearances, in Algiers and throughout the region, is all the more remarkable because Baker suffered a series of life-threatening illnesses in North Africa, from sepsis (after a botched medical procedure) to peritonitis. In fact, in October 1942, rumors began that she had died, with authoritative reports appearing in newspapers throughout France. La Dépeche du Berry, from Southern France, headlined “Josephine Baker has Died,” as did other sources, which then found it necessary to retract the claim. There is authoritative evidence that Maurice Chevalier planted the story, after a hospitalized Baker refused to see him in Casablanca, with the great music hall and movie star apparently assuming that only someone at death’s door might have better things to do than enjoy a bedside visit with him.\n\nUndeterred, Chevalier gave the press a completely fictionalized account of an imagined visit. As reported in the French newspaper 7 Jours, Chevalier assured Baker, “Don’t worry! We’ll be together again at the Casino de Paris when the war is over, and you will sing better than ever.” Baker, in this telling, overcome, said “Thank you, Maurice,” and “kissed his hands like the little black girls would from Carolina or Virginia.”\n\nChevalier should have known better, because his relationship with Baker had been strained since at least the beginning of the war, because of his willingness to entertain the Nazis occupying France. The rivalry was a public one, and the press was only too eager to report on it. Almost a year after Chevalier’s thwarted hospital visit, France headlined, “Josephine Baker Against Maurice Chevalier,” and informed readers that Baker had “bitterly denounced” him. She told the newspaper that Chevalier, who “once boasted of Franco-English collaboration, is now working for Goebbels.” Then, to drive home the point, she added, “He even performed in Berlin.”\n\nAlthough she mostly remained in North Africa during the war, Baker hardly was absent from France. Her films played throughout the country, for instance in March 1941, when Princess Tam-Tam (1935) had a reprise at the Caméra cinema in Marseille, or in July of that year when it played at the Star in Toulouse. Zouzou, from 1934, also made frequent appearances, for example in December 1940 when it showed in Marseille, also at the Caméra, at the same time that Baker herself starred in that city in La Créole. Zouzou came back to Marseille in August 1941, this time at Le Madeleine cinema. But at least from the available materials, and they are hard to come by, Baker’s films never played in Paris during the German occupation.\n\nAlthough most evidence is missing, the Nazis did publish one fan magazine that provides some information. Ciné-Mondial had a name so benign (Film World) that readers might almost forget that its sponsor was the occupying German authority. Because Paris was so central to the film culture of France, as well as to the Nazis’ desire for control of the continent, Ciné-Mondial published fairly complete film listings every week for the city, and they seem to indicate that none of the cinemas in Paris played a Josephine Baker film for the duration of the Occupation.\n\nIn the issue from October 17, 1941, however, in the Ciné-Mondial letters column, the magazine printed a question from Thérèse S. “I am 17 years old,” Thérèse said, and then added, “and a mulatta.” After identifying her age and race, she asked, “Could I take part in one of your competitions?” a reference to the occasional “Select a New Movie Star” contests that the magazine ran, asking readers to vote on potential cinema personalities based on photographs of unknown young people (see my post at https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/38257950/posts/3749323255). The Ciné-Mondial editors, asserting the Nazi determination to use cinema as the sign of German benevolence towards the French, responded, “Of course, little Thérèse.” Then, to give her the confidence that even someone of her racial background might become famous, they told her that, “besides, only one name need come to your lips to give you hope—and this is a name that all of us know—Josephine Baker!”\n\nThere would be other signs of Baker in Paris, signs that perhaps served to underscore the absence of her films from cinemas, or the star herself from music halls. Her records were still available, and ads for them ran in newspapers. French radio played those records often, and so fans in Paris could tune in to hear them, and Baker herself appeared in a radio adaptation of the Pierre Benoit novel L’Atlantide in January 1941, although the recording may have been made before the German occupation began. There were also other celebrities who had connections to Baker. In February 1942, for instance, Paris-Soir ran a story about Robert Belkeir, the heavyweight champion of France, and remarked that this great athlete had “the good fortune to be the godson of Josephine Baker.”\n\nThe star herself did not return to Paris until after the Liberation. Newspapers announced the news that Baker was back, less as a star than as someone committed to doing everything she could to help end the war. The daily paper Défense de la France ran the story on the front page on October 11, 1944, with a photo of Baker on the Champs-Elysées, the Arc de Triomphe in back of her, the great diva and the great monument to France’s military past sharing the image. “I’m just a soldier,” the headline quoted Baker as saying. Exoticizing and infantilizing Baker, as always, while extolling her courage, the story concluded that “the childish bird of the islands of the Casino de Paris has become…social, serious, charming, a little melancholic.” Then the story ended with a tacit acknowledgment of her bravery, resolve, and importance to Paris and the rest of France: “Dearest Josephine Baker.”"
