Remembering the exact moment you saw Place Dauphine for the first time.\n\n100 Contemplating all the ghosts who have walked the same momentous boulevards.\n\nI just realized this was far too easy.\n\n100 layers of Paris is too narrow for such a magnificent city.\n\nI should have held off until my 1,000th blog --\n\nbecause -- it should come as no surprise --\n\nit's a piece of cake to find 900 more layers of Paris.\n\nThanks for sharing in the joy of The Paris Effect.\n\nI have a crush on Nancy -- Nancy, France that is.\n\nImmersed in elegance, dripping with art nouveau architecture,\n\nfurniture and objets d'art, Nancy is the perfect French getaway,\n\nideal for lovers of art, sophisticated style and fine cuisine.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't sure if this was worth more than a quick overnight.\n\nMost guidebooks recommend Nancy as little more than a cursory\n\ndiversion on your way between the prestigious and universally\n\nadored wine-soaked regions of Champagne and Alsace.\n\nAnd then there's the whole Alsace-Lorraine thing --- the more obscure\n\nLorraine always playing second banana to blue-chip Alsace.\n\nLittle hyped Nancy fares even less ink.\n\nHow wrong those back-seat drivers are.\n\nTake a closer look and you'll find an intriguing city where the best bits\n\nare polished and nuanced, a corner of France with a different sort of flavor.\n\nIf you love art and you love France, you too will be glad\n\nyou scored a date with beautiful Nancy.\n\nNancy is best known for its large neoclassical square,\n\nPlace Stanislas,\n\na great place to start your tour.\n\nKnown as Place Stan to the locals, this resplendent piece\n\nof real estate will knock your socks off.\n\nSo fancy, it may even out-ritz The Ritz in blue-blooded Place Vendome Paris.\n\nWrought iron gateways surround pale stone buildings and elaborate fountains,\n\na setting that's lavish enough to say it's fit for a king -- which is appropriate since\n\nit was a king -- make that a deposed king -- who brought the ornate square to light.\n\nKing Stanislas I of Poland lost his kingdom when the\n\nTreaty of Vienna ended the war between France and Austria.\n\nThe titans of Austria negotiated an agreement to unseat the King of Poland.\n\nIn exchange, France strategically offered the deposed king the dukedom of Lorraine.\n\nFrench King Louis XV was quite simply \"keeping it in the family\".\n\nStanislas of Poland was his father-in-law so the deal made peace\n\nand all parties came out ahead.\n\nAs thanks for his new role in France, Stanislas created a royal square\n\n(1752-1755) to honor his french (son-in-law) king.\n\nHe pulled out all the stops, fashioning a symmetrical masterpiece\n\nconsidered to be one of the finest squares in all of Europe,\n\nso much so that it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nUNESCO's stated goal \"to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\"\n\nunderscores the brilliance of this architectural wonder.\n\nI couldn't say it any better.\n\nNancy is a triumph of French artistry.\n\nNear majestic Place Stanislas, you'll find two more examples\n\nof the Polish-king-turned-duke's generosity.\n\nPlace de la Carrière and Place d'Alliance extend the symmetrical\n\nperfection of his architectural tour de force.\n\nSometimes overlooked by the more conspicuous Place Stan,\n\nthese treasures have been recognized by UNESCO as another\n\nexample of Stanislas' monumental reconstructive surgery in his adopted home.\n\nThe expression urban planning connotes a modern effort to tie together\n\nthe organization and design of a city.\n\nIn this case, Stanislas connected medieval Nancy to the \"new\" town\n\nbuilt in the 17th century.\n\nA grand palace with a superb perspective offer an air of refinement\n\nmade for romance and a reason to slow down.\n\nSavor the pretty fountains, trees, pavilions and flowers -- just\n\none more thing to love about fancy Nancy.\n\nHistoric candy shop filled to the brim with bergamots and traditional macarons will sweeten your visit\n\nNancy refuses to rest on her laurels.\n\nThis art-crazed city boasts treasures conspicuously unconventional,\n\nmaking this traveler wonder why it's not on more \"must see\" itineraries.\n\nThe School of Nancy (Ecole de Nancy) is a storehouse of art nouveau riches.\n\nI can always define my feelings by the number of capitol letters and\n\nexclamation points I use in my travel journal -- for this particular museum,\n\nI penned STUNNING!! OVERWHELMED!!! BEAUTIFUL!!!!\n\nYou get the point.\n\nThe Art Nouveau movement -- 1880 until around 1910 -- is considered\n\none of the great periods of artistic style.\n\nDefined by exquisitely curved lines, the design serves up\n\na near fatal blend of luxury and ornate technique -- yet remains\n\nsteeped in a graceful harmony with nature.\n\nThe end result projects romance and femininity, a style influence\n\nwe usually associate with big brother Paris.\n\nDecorative arts had finally earned a seat in the hierarchy of the\n\nart world, a promotion from the back room.\n\nThere was glory in the intricately wrought\n\nmasterpieces that defined the art nouveau movement.\n\nYou can visit the School of Nancy, now an easy-going museum housed\n\nin a beautiful 1909 villa -- and a lovely garden to match.\n\nYou'll fill your quota of art nouveau master works,\n\ncapped off by Emile Galle's sensually curvy furniture that\n\nwill make you want to race home to chop your own tragic trappings to pieces.\n\nArtists of the day, architects, glass-masters and inventors make for\n\na museum experience you'll never forget.\n\nThe name Daum is synonymous with the city of Nancy and is quite naturally\n\none of the highlights of this triumph, particularly their colorful lamps and vases.\n\nDo not miss the chance to see this exquisite legacy, for me,\n\nthe highlight of my trip to Nancy.\n\nLook for Louis Majorelle's stunning villa in the heart of art nouveau Nancy\n\nNancy's neo-classical Museum of Fine Arts (Musee des Beaux-Arts de Nancy), located in the heart of Place Stanislas, includes works\n\nyou'd never expect to see outside Paris or London.\n\nTintoretto, Rubens, Caravaggio, Delacroix, and Picasso are just a handful\n\nof the richly accomplished artists that make this museum so special.\n\nGreat works from the 14th century through the 21st century make it a rich stop\n\nfor even those who don't typically enjoy art museums.\n\nSculpture by Maillol, Rodin and Zadkine energize the abundantly loaded galleries.\n\nThe Daum Exhibition Gallery contains some 600 pieces from Nancy's\n\nmost influential glassworks company so if you didn't get your fill\n\nat the School of Nancy, you'll find it here.\n\nRecognizing so many diverse elements in one grand gallery\n\nis the consummate art experience and you need not worry about the crowds\n\nyou typically encounter in other European capitols.\n\nStrolling Nancy's neighborhoods is easy.\n\nThe best parts are pretty centrally located and soon enough\n\nyou'll forget about your achy feet.\n\nIn Nancy, it's all about the details -- leaf and tendril motifs, birds,\n\nflowers and insects combined in intricate curved designs in\n\nevery neighborhood marked by the art nouveau movement.\n\nThere are other parts of the city that are markedly medieval in flavor\n\nand still others propelled by French classicism.\n\nTake your time and focus on the small details.\n\nSeveral parks offer gorgeous green views including an important botanical garden. As in all of France, churches play a large role but if your time is short,\n\nI recommend a look at either The Cathedral of Nancy or the Basilique Saint-Epvre.\n\nWhen in Nancy, let's face it -- the focus is art nouveau.\n\nAnd that alone is a worthwhile effort.\n\nThe Brasserie Excelsior is an excellent example of art nouveau design\n\nThe Triumphal Arch of Nancy, built to honor French King Louis XV, reminds us of Rome's Arch of Septimius Severus\n\nA mecca for art nouveau lovers - the esteemed Ecole de Nancy\n\nEight sons of Nancy lost their lives in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781 fighting for American independence.\n\nPretty Parc Pépiniére is worth a stroll.\n\nQuirky but fun bistro Le Bouche a L'Oreille - cheese, wine, fondue = comfort cuisine near Place Stanislas\n\nEglise des Cordeliers is the resting place for the Dukes of Lorraine\n\nThe other face of Nancy's fine arts museum - another time and place\n\nNancy is a gateway into the rarified world of art nouveau.\n\nThat's huge on its own -- but there's so much more.\n\nIts richly appointed Place Stanislas is so elegant, it comes as a surprise.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned quiche lorraine yet,\n\nthe dish made famous in this land of bacon and cream.\n\nGood king Stanislas I contributed to Nancy's wealth of riches in other ways as well.\n\nFrench cuisine's legendary baba au rhum, a dessert we typically associate\n\nwith Paris bistro cooking, was created for the feasts he so proudly hosted.\n\nEnjoy lunch at L'Impromptu in the Marché Couvert for a\n\nfrench taste of what's fresh from the market daily.\n\nAnd please, spend a couple of days wrapped in Nancy's extraordinary aura,\n\nsurely one of France's best kept secrets.\n\nPorte de la Craffe - medieval gateway to the city"
