        "text": "The key to fully enjoying this film is to forget for a few minutes that it's a vehicle for Josephine Baker, and view it as a French version of a screwball comedy. Apart from the grafted-on Pygmalion theme, the script is really about war between husband and wife.\n\nFrom that perspective it's really as good as than many similar films produced by Hollywood during the same era. The viewer can then have fun comparing the Gallic take on the theme with the American and English approaches.\n\nThe production dance number is clearly an imitation of Busby Berkeley, and nowhere near as lavish. But enjoyable enough in its own rights. Again, the fun is in comparing the French choreographer's way of doing things with Berkeley. And ... think about it for a minute ... did French chorus lines at that (or any) time really have tap dancing?\n\nThen go back to thinking about Josephine Baker. It's a shame she didn't get to dance more, but the dance to Sous Le Ciel and the Samba in the final number were quite good.\n\nThis movie had so much promise and failed so badly. There are only a couple of songs by Josephine Baker - this is not a musical. There is a dance that is so badly done it's funny. The plot is a mishmash of jealousy, revenge, and Pygmalion. A white Frenchman in Africa stumbles across an African girl and decides to use her to make his philandering wife jealous. He teaches the African to be a white European, then claims she is an Indian princess. He returns to Europe with her, where she is acclaimed. The philandering wife is having an affair with an Indian who is played by a white man in dark makeup. The Indian recognizes the fraud at once, but doesn't disclose it. He offers the \"princess\" the choice of continuing to live as a European or the return to Africa. There is a great deal of material in what's going on, but it's never delved into. If it's not going to be a musical, I wanted to know why the Indian didn't expose her; I wanted to know more about the choice between Europe and Africa. instead, the Frenchman's ploy works, his wife becomes jealous and returns to his arms. Tam Tam returns to Africa with a native man who beat her, and they apparently live happily ever after.\n\nIt's an interesting movie to see for the history: the casual racism, the lousy choreography, Europe between wars. Baker is wasted as a child-like savage with only two songs.\n\nA French novelist, disgusted by his wife's society friends, goes to North Africa for a respite. There he encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty. To spite his wife, who is romancing a Maharajah, he decides to train & educate the girl, and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESSE TAM TAM...\n\nThe marvelous Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable French film. With her enormous eyes & infectious smile, she makes contact with the viewer's heartstrings immediately. Her over-sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch. Baker makes us care about what's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation & introduction to European mores.\n\nAlbert Préjean does very well as the Pygmalion to Baker's Galatea; also effective are Georges Peclet as a half-caste servant, and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah.\n\nThe film is very handsome & well made, looking a little reminiscent of Busby Berkeley movies being produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM hasn't any racism. It should be pointed out that there was no Hays Office or Production Code in France. Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to 'Under The African Sky,' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the cinema's more memorable moments.\n\nActual location filming in Tunisia greatly enhances the film.\n\nJosephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, into a very poor family. Her talent & driving ambition, however, soon pushed her into moving East and she was briefly a cast member of the Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that America in the mid-1920's held great limitations for a gifted Black woman, she managed to get herself to Paris, where she eventually joined the Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity. A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen & worked for the Resistance during the early days of the War. Baker relocated to Morocco for the duration and entertained Allied troops stationed there.\n\nAfter the War, Baker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties. For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68.\n\nHaving appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of her generation's truly legendary performers."
