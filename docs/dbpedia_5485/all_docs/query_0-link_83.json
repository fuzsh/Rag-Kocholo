Isle of Wight\n\nDear Dominic, Just a line to say that I have now fitted all the screens to the windows and I am so impressed, they are amazing! I was able to fit them so easily and they are purrfect (excuse the pun). As you can see my little cat can now smell the outside world in total safety and I have piece of mind, thank you again for making this amazing product. I will be recommending you to all my friends. Please do feel free to use the above as part of customer reviews and for advertising.\n\nAW. Middlesex\n\nThe screens are on at last! Many thanks,\n\nKB. London W6\n\nVery pleased with the Flat cat items, it looks really good and my cat approves. We’ve tested it with open windows and it works beautifully.\n\nMA. Sandown, Isle of Wight\n\nHi, Dominic, Just to let you know that my FlatCats arrived this morning - and I had them installed by midday. They're perfectly wonderful! So easy to install! As soon as one of my cats finds his or her way up to the window ledge, I shall get a picture of them. The configuration of my conservatory is such that the photos I managed to take this afternoon don't show them off to best advantage.\n\nMK. Banbury, Oxfordshire\n\nToday I received my twin pack of standard window covers. I am so pleased that someone recommended your product on the Gransnet Forum, when I mentioned my Kamikaze cat preventing me from opening my upstairs windows. Today after fixing them I have had my bedroom windows open for the first time for many years! Thank you so much, the strength and quality are such that I trust their protection. My cat just enjoyed the fresh air but didn't touch the mesh.\n\nSW Oxford\n\nHi Dominic many thank for door screen perfect as usual. Really happy. Devon Rex loves it she can be even more nosey than usual. Will be ordering again in future as I will be moving to France.\n\nKM.

Bedminster, Bristol\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to say thanks so much for the speedy service. Did not expect the custom flat cat to arrive so quickly! It fits perfectly (bathroom window) and means I can now leave the window open to let the steam out without wondering if Abbey is going to make a run for it!

Middlewich, Cheshire\n\nThanks so much for the custom Flat Cats screen. It's a perfect fit and I can, at last, have my French doors open onto the balcony without fear of my cats escaping. Fidget, the ginger one, launched at the screen after this picture was taken, and climbed all the way to the top.\n\nRealising he couldn't get the screen to come off the frame, he dropped tome floor and gave up trying. He is sitting at the front window instead now, which has the Flat Cats I bought a few years ago.\n\nI will always recommend your amazing product and service to friends and family. Thanks so much again.\n\nRL. Markham, Caerphilly\n\nHi Dominic, Thanks for my flatcats arrived today all fitted and I'm so happy with them.\n\nWill let you know when we do the next order.

My 3 Burmese cats (an energetic breed) were sitting enjoying the fresh air and working out how they could escape.

I was able to wholeheartedly recommend your product and gave your contact details. So thankyou for an excellent service and best wishes.\n\nJB. London NW1\n\nHi Dominic, I did thank you when we got our Flat Cats, but feel I must get in touch again. Having the FCs in the hot summer we have had has made so much difference to us. The 2 kitchen ones ( room at front nearest drive to road) meant open windows,a cool room and no chance of our 2 cats getting out and the bedroom one (we are in a bungalow) stopped any muddy paws on bedding and no \"presents\" brought in. There is a cat flap at rear of bungalow for cats to go out. So thanks again for excellent product..\n\nRS.

With the hot weather we couldn’t open our windows for fear of losing our house cat but we ordered two flat cats and quickly ordered two more.

That was quick. Thank you so much. I’m so pleased with the Flat Cats. My daughter didn’t even notice I’d put them up. She remarked on how little the mesh affects the light throughput.

Romford, Essex\n\nHi Dominic, I just wanted to thank you for the flat cats - both the product and the service. The vet told me to keep my cat indoors for health reasons so I've had a lot of worry trying to stop him from jumping out of the window and getting badly injured again (he is a rescue cat who was hit by a car) As my cat is very inquisitive and fearless, my only option was to never open windows. I was impressed with the friendly customer service and the great deal that I was given on my 3 custom flat cats. My cat has only tried to climb them once and I was pleased to see that they were very sturdy. Ive sent a photo of my cat in his new favourite place, sitting on top of the toilet looking out of the open bathroom window!I'll be moving house soon and definitely ordering some more from you.\n\nSR - Manchester\n\nHi there :) would just like to say thank you for the wonderful mesh window nets for my cat !

Livingston, West Lothian\n\nDear Dominic - I just wanted to let you know what a fantastic product you have. Our cat decided to start attempting to abscond out the windows a few weeks ago- just as the weather started to get hot hot hot. We've had to keep the windows closed for fear he might fall out (he's not the most dainty or co-ordinated boy!) and it has been unbearably hot. 10 minutes after the postman delivered the Flat Cats, we have them fitted, the windows are wide open and we can have a fresh breeze without needing to wonder what the cat is up to. Thank you so much for an ingenious product!\n\nLW. Stafford, Staffordshire\n\nHi Dominic - Just a note to say that the flat cat window covers are brilliant. Both are perfect fits and they've been an absolute god send given the weather of the last 2 weeks - I think we'd have cooked with the windows closed!!\n\nIm really glad I found your site - thank you :-)\n\nTD. Colchester, Essex\n\nHi Dominic, Many Many thanks for the flat cats, having bought from you before I knew they were excellent value and thanks for putting the narrow fixings on that go all the way around the window just that added protection is great as my female Sox loves nothing more that hanging on the screens. All my windows are now open wide so the air flow through the flat is lovely and will keep my two cats happy, they now don't know which window to sit at so they are checking them all out. The speedy delivery was excellent to as tomorrow is said to be the hottest so far and I am happy in the knowledge that my indoor cars will be safe and cool. I am know telling everyone I know who has cats to get them.\n\nRF. Warrington\n\nMany thanks for the Flat Cats! I have now put them up and am relieved that I can have fresh air in my flat again.

Thank you so much again.\n\nTB & MB Barnstaple, North Devon\n\nJust wanted to email to say thank you so much for my order. My cat has never been so happy (unless he's been on the catnip) to sit on the window sill. The night I put them up he was staring out of the window for 3 hours. They are so easy to put up especially with help from my cat. He's also jumped up on them trying to catch birds outside and they haven't even shifted. This is the best thing I have ever bought and I'll definitely passing this on to all of my cat crazy friends.\n\nLE. Cannock Staffordshire\n\nHi Dominic Thank you for the prompt delivery of the protectors. Feeling v chuffed - I managed to put them up myself!! And they look amazing!!I'll pass the word on...\n\nICW.

A brilliant invention and a must for cat owners!\n\nMany thanks and all the best,\n\nEM. London SW6\n\nHi there, just to let you know I have the screens fitted now. Leah (the cat) doesn't seem too impressed with them. Don't really mind though as I can have nice cool air circulating in my bedroom without worrying about her falling out. Thanks again.\n\nAM. Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland\n\nHi Dominic, I just wanted to say thank you very much for our flat cat which was delivered last weekend :-) it fits the window perfectly & our mogsters can sniff the fresh air whilst safety contained in the flat!

Kingston-Upon-Thames, Surrey\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to let you know how happy I am with Flat Cats! They have been up now for a few weeks and it's been lovely to have been able to leave the windows open without fear of a cat falling out of it!\n\nThey are sturdy products, I have had one of the cats climbing it and it held very well under her weight. She is not a very big cat but she does weight between 7 or 9 pounds (haven't weight her recently).\n\nAlso reading in bed at night, without being visited by giant moths and various buzzy creatures coming in from the garden, is a big plus!\n\nBest of all though was the outstanding level of service, prompt, competent and honest, which are all qualities one doesn't encounter often these days when dealing with businesses, especially online businesses. Your honesty was very much appreciated when you could have made double the money from me, when I made a mistake on the measurements and got something too big for my windows, you didn't and got me the right Flat Cats very quickly and I am very grateful for that! Anyway, many thanks and it was a pleasure doing business with you\n\nAL Slough, Berkshire\n\nDear Dominic, Sorry it's taken me a few weeks to reply, but I just wanted to send a note to say thank you so much for the Flat Cats, which arrived perfectly (and quickly! thank you!) and most importantly fit perfectly!! - Really appreciate you spending the time to talk me through it all on the phone and for recommending the narrower fixings, they work perfectly with my window frames. - It's so lovely to have the windows open and not be permanently terrified that Polly will fall out! She's had a bit of a sniff at the Flat Cats, pawed them a bit to see what they feel like and now just completely ignores them. - I told a work colleague about them and although she doesn't have cats, she's thinking they might be a perfect solution to some \"challenges\" she has with insects at her holiday home in France, so she may be in touch!\n\nThank you again - such a brilliant product and thanks for the wonderful customer service, I am genuinely really happy to have found a friendly, British company with personal customer service, such a change from the robotic conglomerates!\n\nHJ. Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk\n\nJust wanted to say thank you - my flat cat arrived today and fits the door beautifully! I am now sitting with the door open knowing my fur babies cannot get out.\n\nRF.

AW and suki xx\n\nAW. Newton Abbot, Devon\n\nThank you so much for the swift delivery of the three screens for my Mum. I fitted them quite quickly yesterday and she's thrilled! Her cat, Bertie, is not particularly interested, which is great. We'll see if that changes. We may well be getting in touch for more, as her bungalow gets very hot when the sun shines, and she can't open windows for fear of the cat climbing out. Your screens are a godsend. Excellent service, and it looks like the product is pretty good too, at this stage....thank you.\n\nGS. Plymouth\n\nOnce again very happy with both the product and the excellent service.

Warrington, Cheshire\n\nThe flat cats arrived on Monday but couldn't pick them up till today ( Friday) due to no one being in the building and we were at work ,, so a super speedy delivery from you , also have 1 of the front room flat cats up so far and all is well its brilliant to be-able to open the window and let the breeze in with out having to stand guard on it , still got my eyes open tho as its new and kitty is sniffing the net and air. All in all very Happy Customers\n\nJE. St Austell, Cornwall\n\nThank you very much\n\nHi Dominic, Thank you for the speedy delivery. The flat cat for the patio door fits perfect. Marble does seem to like climbing up it but it is very strong and stayed in place. Nice to enjoy the fresh air again. Thanks.\n\nDS. Lancaster\n\nReally pleased with the Flat-cats on mum's windows. Excellent results and exemplary service. Thank you very much.\n\nWH. Aberdeen\n\nThanks for the super speedy delivery - I was surprised to have received them so quickly!\n\nI put them up immediately, no fuss whatsoever.\n\nAttached is a photo for your client testimonials - last week Penelope squeezed through the window when it was ever so slightly open, jumped down one story to the street and went for a walk towards a very busy road. Here she is, safely inside the flat, protected by the Flat Cat. This is a must for all owners of indoor cats who still want to be able to open their windows!\n\nTP. London EC4V\n\nI wanted to take 5 minutes out of my day to express my delight with your product. When i ordered 3 Window Nets from your company I was a little apprehensive if they would stop my cat due to her determination to escape into the great outdoors added with her ability to climb. I just want to say your product is BRILLIANT ... not only is my home insect free and cool at night time, my cat is also safe and sound indoors and now ignores the nets after failing her great escape 4 or 5 times by climbing the nets in the hope to pull them from there fixings. (which they never did, nor did the cat manage to damage the nets themselves) Truly brilliant product and great customer support prior to purchase Well done :-)\n\nSM. Shrewsbury, Shropshire\n\nHi Dominic, just to say a big Thank You for sorting out my order so quickly. Got them at work today and my first window is done. It was so easy to fit, and it's just lovely having the kitchen window finally open! My cat, Mickey, has been sitting on the sill getting some air. Have already recommended them to a friend.Brilliant idea, thank you again.\n\nLD. Carshalton Surrey\n\nI have had flat cats from you a few years ago, and have now moved so have had to re order, so I can't wait! I've even told my new neighbour about them as they have said they would live to open their windows and never knew about them, so when I get them, I'm going to show them and they can order. I need to order a few more as well. But thank you as always for your quick service\n\nLB. Nuneaton, Warwickshire\n\nI’ve just received my Flat Cats delivery, the four of them fit perfectly. I haven’t installed them as yet, kittens are arriving early July but I’l be ready in plenty of time for them. I’ll send you some pics and further feedback when i go “live”/ I must say that are are superb, they cut out very little light, you can see quite clearly through them and they are made extremely well.\n\nBC. Cardiff, Wales\n\nHi Dominic, we received parcel on Friday and flat cats are now installed. My husband and I are very pleased with them, they do exactly what you say they will, that is keep cats safely inside. Mo & Jo[ the cats] can go outside the back of our property via a cat flap, but now they will not be able to jump out of the windows onto the front of the house. Thanks again for all your help in sizing,etc..My daughter-in-law thinks they are so good that she is going to see if you can help help her with a flat cat for a patio door. Once again thanks very much, they are a great product.\n\nRS. Lancaster Lancashire\n\nThe screens have now been fitted and hardly notice. Thank you for your good service.\n\nJG. Tonbridge, Kent\n\nHi Dominic, I've had my Flat Cat for nearly a month now and I couldn't express how wonderful your product is. Since putting up the screen on the day I received it, my worries of Muffin's paws being injured while resting them in the window frame instantly disappeared. Now, I can even look forward to keeping my windows open at night in the coming summer months :-) Thank you so, so much.\n\nCK. Edinburgh\n\nHi Dominic, Just a quick email to say thank you for the made-to-measure door cover.I finally managed to get around to fitting it fully today. It is a perfect fit and works exactly as hoped. I am sure the cats are not as impressed but we are delighted with it. Thank you once again; kindest regards\n\nSW. West Kirby, Wirral\n\nHi Dominic, Just to let you know that the flat-cat arrived today. We have not attached it to the door yet as our kitten does not arrive till July! But we have held it up against the door and it looks like it will fit fine. Thank you for all your help and fast communication. I shall be recommending you to anyone with a feline friend!!\n\nJJ. Christchurch Dorset\n\nHi Dominic\n\nI collected my Flat Cats from the Post Office today and I fitted them earlier this evening.\n\nAll I can say is WOW! What a fantastic invention - this is going to make such a difference to me, Hector and Pixie! I cannot thank you enough for your help, generosity and amazing service, I am truly overwhelmed by it all.\n\nI volunteer at an animal sanctuary in Sale (the Society for Abandoned Animals) and I shall be promoting your website on our Facebook page and I do hope it generates some business for you, you deserve it.\n\nI have attached a couple of photos of Hector and Pixie exploring their Flat Cat!\n\nWith very best wishes and thank you so much.\n\nNL. Stockport\n\nHi Dominic, Hurrah! It works! Thank you so much :-)\n\nAA. Oswestry\n\nHi Dominic, Just to say the flat cats arrived on Friday! Put them all up today and my idea for the velux window worked really well. So pleased with them, all I need now is a really hot evening to be able to benefit from having the windows open all night. Thank you so much for the super fast service and the wonderful product. At last we can relax and have windows open while we sleep. Kind regards\n\nLH. Redhill, Surrey\n\nThought you might like to see our recently purchased Flat Cats product in action. This is our little boy cat, Domino, enjoying an upstairs breeze for the very first time! One of our cats once jumped out of an upstairs window (it's ok, she wasn't hurt) and since then we've been too afraid to open the upstairs windows up properly. But now thanks to your product we can have our upstairs windows open again! It'll make such a difference this summer I can tell you!\n\nEB. London SW12\n\nHi Dominic! My husband and I want to thank you for such a wonderful product! I'm leaving a picture of Pi and Neko sitting in front one of their 'Flat Cat' windows. Glorious! I'm from Florida and use to having screens on all the windows. Since being in the UK it has been quite frustrating until I came across your wonderful product P.S. Thank you for the fantastic customer services!\n\nPi, Neko, Laney & Lee\n\nDominic I have to say the product you have is fantastic and good value for the money.I plan to have all my windows screened as i have been looking for this type of product for years.

They were sent to us so quickly and fit the windows perfectly! I couldn't face another summer of the windows being shut in our flat- especially being pregnant this summer!!! The cats love them as they can feel the fresh air and hear all these new noises! Will definitely be ordering some more in the future and recommending to my friends and family! Many thanks again!!!\n\nAF. Sanderstead (South Croydon)\n\nDear Dominic, Got it , love it and will be on for more! Can you make large ones for patio doors?

As you can see they look great!!\n\nSJ. Ramsgate\n\nI thought the least I could do is send you a picture taken a few weeks ago of our two cats who are now just about 2 1/2 alive and kicking thanks in part to Flat Cats. They are brother and sister the large one, on the right the boy is London and the little girl is Paris.\n\nPlease feel free to use there picture and my thanks on your web page.\n\nJO. London\n\nThis is just a big thanks for my FLAT CAT screen,\n\nI have fitted it today with no messing about trying to fix screws in as the fixing's are just right,\n\nalso I would like to thank the person who I spoke to regarding my custom FLAT CAT he was a huge help and very pleasant to talk to and very very helpful in understanding the query that I had, as for the screen I can honestly say I feel much better knowing that I can have my windows open without having to keep my cat out of the living room just in case she jumps through the window, now It gives us a more secure feeling knowing she is safe. thanks for all your help and I can guarantee I WILL be ordering another one very soon.\n\nMS. Birmingham, West Midlands\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for my Flat Cats screen which I fitted this morning. It is a bright, warm, sunny day and I can now have a window open. Very easy to fit and very effective! I shall be sending you an order for another window, when, of course, I will be a normal customer! Thank you.... such a simple idea and it works very well!\n\nMS.

Thanks again,\n\nSW. East Hanningfield, Essex\n\nDear Dominic, Flat cats arrived, fitted and magic (again). Thank you very much for your prompt and efficient service. We'll certainly be recommending flat cats and may even be back to you again.\n\nVH. Lytham St Annes, Lancashire\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to say thank you once again. I finally got some time to put the flat cat's on the windows! It's gotten really warm the last few days and my flat has felt like a sauna without the windows open and I'm way too paranoid to open them at all without the flat cat's up after Sophie's accident.\n\nAlso, Sophie's accident turned out to be worse than the vet initially thought. When she went to the vets again on the Monday afternoon she was limping a lot on one of her front legs and they did an xray and found out she'd broken her leg and had to have surgery to put pins in it. When we went to the vets again today for a bandage change he told me that while the bandage was off she was putting pressure on her leg and trying to walk using it so he's fairly certain she's recovering well. She's also had to have cage rest since her surgery which she's absolutely hating, but it's for the best and stops her jumping around and delaying the healing. I'm so thankful I have pet insurance because the vet said without the surgery it's unlikely the bone would fuse back together correctly and the leg would need to be amputated, and I'd feel even more guilty than I already do if she had to have the leg removed. It's already come close to £2000 for the treatment and without pet insurance I'd not be able to afford that..\n\nRight now Chloe is sitting on the window ledge looking out of the window and enjoying the fresh air, and it's also so nice for me to be able to cool down my flat a little!\n\nThank you very much!\n\nSD. Birmingham\n\nThanks for the window mesh! They fit perfectly! It was lovely to see the cats by the window feeling the breeze and hearing all the sounds.\n\nEM. Stratford-Upon-Avon\n\nGood Morning Dominic, The nets arrived last weeks and took no time at all to set up over the weekend. Thank you for your time and help over the phone.\n\nLC. London\n\nDear Flat Cats, I just wanted to say thank you for the excellent service and quick delivery of our custom flat cat! I ordered it on Monday and it arrived today!(Wednesday!) It fits perfectly and now Oskar can enjoy the fresh air whilst I can enjoy having the kitchen window open. What a fabulous product - I wish I'd thought of it myself! Thank you once again -\n\nVG. Haslingden Lancashire\n\nAll arrived yesterday (01 Mar) safe and sound.\n\nMany thanks for your help.\n\nPepper likes the box too.\n\nTV. Hove\n\nHi Dominic,\n\nI just wanted to say thank you. I received a card on Friday but haven't had chance to collect them from the post office yet, which I'll do tomorrow.\n\nToday there was a bit of an accident with Sophie. I had a window open slightly and forgot to close it when I left the room. I live in a house converted to flats and it's like a converted attic and I couldn't find where Sophie was and saw the window wider open which must have been either the wind or pushed open by her, and she must have either jumped or fallen from the roof. I rushed outside to find her in the garden very scared and when I brought her back in and she was limping a lot so I took her to an emergency vet. Nothing is broken though luckily but she's a little sore and shaken up by the whole experience.\n\nI'm so glad you invented flat cats so nothing like this will ever happen to my cat's again. I spent the whole time from when it happened until the vet checked her over in tears.\n\nYou said in your video that you wondered if you were just being over protective, but I know now that windows are a real risk and using flat cat's isn't being over protective. I think anyone living in a flat should purchase flat cats. When I do some day move house or the flat cat's get worn out, I'll definitely be buying more, because my cat's safety is worth any amount money.\n\nIf you want to use any of this email on your website to let others know how important it is to protect their cat's from the danger of open windows you're welcome to. I feel so stupid for leaving the window open. I've never forgotten to close the windows until now and this one time the worst case scenario did happen.\n\nThank you again,\n\nSD. Edgbaston (Birmingham)\n\nI thought you might like to see my cat enjoying his first \"flat-cat\" window last summer (attached). I'll be back for more shortly!\n\nWith renewed thanks,\n\nMH. London\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to let you know that I received the Flat Cat a few days ago and it's fits perfectly. It's really well made, thanks!\n\nOZ. New York (USA)\n\nI just wanted to say a big Thank You for my Flat Cats which I have just installed.\n\nYour customer service has been fantastic and the product matches up to it!\n\nI am an active member on several pet related forums and will put posts up to recommend your company.\n\nCS. Walthamstow\n\nHi Dominic\n\nI just wanted to say a big thank you for the creation of Flat Cats and the fast turnaround of the order I placed. These are now on the windows and have been a roaring success. None of my cats have managed to damage or remove them and my house is now nicely aired. I no longer have to worry about them attempting daredevil stunts on the roofs.\n\nI am sure we will be back to buy more (eventually all our windows will have them)\n\nTake care and have a lovely Christmas and New Year\n\nAD. Blackburn Lancashire\n\n...and look, shes loving her flat cats. A perfect fit as always. Last night I put them on, opened the windows and let her see a big African thunderstorm. She thought life had suddenly turned into an HD action film :) shes loving the new smells and sounds, a very purry happy cat indeed!\n\nCJ. South Africa\n\nThe screen has stood up to lots of climbing did you get those pics of my kittens (monsters) haahahahahah. The screen has been brilliant. The breeder I got the kittens from is asking about it also\n\nLR. Manchester\n\nI received the screens today it fits perfectly! Thank you\n\nIY. Vancouver, Canada\n\nJust to say thank you for the really quick turnround on our order. Really pleased with them and a great solution for our indoor cat\n\nMC. Dunholme, Lincoln\n\nThank you so much for the bespoke flatcats window covers. As you can see, Faith is unable to escape and we have air! Will be needing two more of these as I stupidly thought front and back windows were the same. Oh well, was going to order them at some point anyway. Will do a couple of art sales soon so will have some readies. Shall also be doing a blog and will forward you the link for your site. Just great. Perfect fit.\n\nNR. Coventry\n\nI just wanted to say thanks so much for helping me to get my flat cat ordered in time before I went away. I appreciate the hurried delivery, thanks so much. The product was super and my mum's bedroom was transformed into a makeshift cattery, complete with fresh air, whilst I was away. My plan worked a treat! A great product and my mum is keeping it up as a fly screen!\n\nLP. Gedling, Nottinghamshire\n\nJust to say these are purrfect! Looking after daughters cat while they're on holiday. Whole problem of me loving fresh air in combined with not really wanting cat out..solved! You hardly notice them..very impressed!\n\nTC. Taverham, Norfolk\n\nThe Flat Cats are Fantastic. Both cats took to them straightaway. The more inquisitive of our two, just had one or two gentle scratches at the first one we put up - no damage done and after all cat flaps were accepted by them. Safe cats and fresh, cooling air up and down stairs.\n\nAP. Taunton (Somerset)\n\nThanks everyone for making the cat window guards. The patio door one the cat bumped into while the door was open. Very funny at the time but safe and secure around the door frame. Many thx people. I might order another very soon. Thx again\n\nLS. Luton (Bedfordshire)\n\nThanks , cat loves sitting by the windows. Smiles and salutations\n\nCL. Loughborough (Leicestershire)\n\nThank you for sending them! They are great and working really well!\n\nAM. Saunderton Lee (Buckinghamshire)\n\nFlat cats received today. They're great! Thank you\n\nGW. Birmingham (West Midlands)\n\nJust to let you know - it arrived ok and is working well. We may be back to order a couple of window sections in September.\n\nAB. St Neots (Cambridgeshire)\n\nWe received our flat cats this morning, they are fantastic, it's made our lives a lot easier and it has been so nice to let the fresh air in, and not worry about the cats getting out.\n\nDA. Haywards Heath (West Sussex)\n\nI'm just dropping you an email to let you know we have recieved our Flat Cat and are very happy with it, it fits perfectly and you can hardly see it! Monkey is loving having the door open, and hasn't tried climbing it either, which is perhaps the only thing in the flat that he hasn't! Thanks again for the great service and speedy delivery. I know you have been busy. Feel free to use this and the picture on your website reviews.\n\nTF. Hackney, London\n\n\"Monkey\" admiring his Flat Cats window protection in Hackney, London\n\nReceived the Flat Cats today and fitted them. It was really easy and I am extremely pleased with them. The two cats and their kittens I foster for the RCPA are getting lots of fresh air and they are safe from falling out my two bedroom windows. Thank you so much for your brilliant idea.\n\nLJ. Biggleswade, Bedfordshire\n\nJust wanted to say our flat-cats arrived this morning. We have two cats who have been very badly treated in the past and this has left them very scared, particularly of humans (except us) so they are unable to go outside, which to us has always felt a shame. However, we now have two very happy cats, particularly our female who contentedly sits on the window seal up against the flat-cat watching the birds and butterflies and enjoying the fresh air. Two happy cats make for two happy humans!\n\nEE. Greetwell, Humberside\n\nYou have changed our lives: Dear Dominic, all I can say is thank you for the service and the product it looks and works great. We can enjoy open windows again, the fresh air at nights is wonderful Regards and thanks\n\nBP. Welwyn, Hertfordshire\n\nHi. My order arrived this morning. It's up at the window now and its fab. We have 2 indoor cats so don't have our windows open unless they are shut out of the room but this means we no longer need to do that. We know we still have to watch them but now with out worry that the could jump through an open window. Cheers\n\nSW. Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands\n\nGood morning Mr Parker, I just wanted to contact you to say how delighted I am with my two flat cats! They fit perfectly at my windows and my cat Charlie really isnt bothered by them. The flat is lovely and cool now, I really wonder how I coped before. Your advice about the sticking strips was perfect too as the screens really fit snug and secure. If you ever have someone asking questions about your product and if it works, would be happy to confirm its fantastic!\n\nJL. Chippenham, Wiltshire\n\nI don't know if you have a customer review section on your site but I'd just like to say how pleased I am with your products. I have 1 little cat and she won't try and chew them or claw them or anything like that to get out, just sits and enjoys the breeze which has been so important at this hot time of the year. Cannot thank you enough! Iincredibly impressed. Would and will recommend you to others.\n\nLA-H. Bicester, Oxfordshire\n\nThanks for your quick response to my order my Burmese cats think it is great. As the lodger I found it very easy to install\n\nTB. Leyland Lancashsire\n\nHi, just wanted to say a huge thank you from my Bengal boys they can now happily window gaze with a cool breeze. Flat cats is truly an amazing product and we will be measuring up for some custom sizes very soon!!\n\nDA. Aylesford (Kent)\n\nI'm just writing to let you know that I've been Flat Cats for 6 weeks now and I found it to be a brilliant and very simple solution to trying to keep my housecats indoors during summer. Before they arrived I was a bit sceptical about whether the velcro would be strong enough to stop the cats escaping. However, it forms a very strong bond and, to be honest, the biggest worry I had initially was that the bond was so strong that I might pull the velcro off the window frame. This did happen on one or two occassions soon after I installed it but,with a little care it was fine and, in any case, the bond between the velcro and the wood has strengthened with time. One thing I would advise, though, is to make sure your cat's claws are kept relatively short as, if they are too long, they can get caught in the mesh\n\nJJ. Falkirk\n\nThanks for the recent custom Flat Cats order fits perfectly, brilliant.\n\nGJ. Swindon\n\nHello Dominic, We just wanted to say thank you for the three flat cats we ordered. They arrived last Friday well packaged. We are very pleased to report that they are working very well for our Bengal cats.\n\nI have attached a photograph to show how pleased they are with them.\n\nRH. Worksop (Nottinghamshire)\n\nI just wanted to thank you for my order, it arrived today and is already being put to use! It fits perfectly.\n\nOur small accident prone younger cat is enjoying a breeze safely and our older cat (terrified of the outside world) is enjoying fresh air from what she considers to be a safe distance about two foot away. Here's a couple of quick photos from my phone, my dSLR battery is on charge so I'll send you any other better ones I may snap incase you want to use them on your site.\n\nCD. Sutton Coldfield\n\nThey arrived and are absolutely brilliant. The house is now cool and house cat Mr Shinto is safe.\n\nSL. Epsom (Surrey)\n\nThanks so much for my order that I received today. Was perfect and we are so happy\n\nSB. London\n\nCan I just say a massive thank you for such fab service. The flat cats arrived this morning and are perfect! We can finally have our bedroom windows open at night without the risk of Lola jumping out.\n\nEW. Southampton\n\nFlat cats received and one is up its brilliant thank you. When I move again I will be ordering more!!!\n\nRG. Worcester\n\nJust to confirm our order arrived this morning and is already in place! Thank goodness as today is looking to be a hot one (and I was worried that by ordering these I had put an end to any more hot days this summer!). As an added bonus, it looks like the Flat Cats will prove good spider deterrents too – at last my son will be able to sleep with his window open (he’s 18).\n\nCB. St Giles (Cambridgeshire)\n\nHi Dom, I received my flat cats today,fitted in an instant and it works a treat.i have left you a message on Facebook .many thanks and good look for the future.\n\nD&J. Oldham\n\nJust to let you know i have received my Flat Cats this morning and half of them are up already! Thanks for your speedy service.\n\nJE. Abersoch (Gwynebb)\n\nDear Dominic. Just to confirm that my Flat cats pack arrived yesterday and as you can see from attached photo - my little rescue cat Caesar took to it immediately, spending the evening on guard duty at the window! We live in a 2nd / 3rd floor apartment and I think he will never be brave enough to go out so your screens are ideal - what a good idea!\n\nMany thanks from myself and Caesar Kind regards\n\nRP. Hampton Hill (Middlesex)\n\nJanis from Glynn Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland has just purchased some Flat Cats ahead of the arrival of two new kittens. They are just so sweet we couldnt resist posting the picture. Many thanks Janis\n\nJust to say that flatcats arrived and fitted to windows. Very pleased with product. As well as cat safety it's stopping pigeons and moths coming in and plants from falling out!\n\nVery good service and I will definitely recommend you.\n\nRB. London\n\nHi, just wanted to say Thank You so much for our custom Flat-Cats! You have made them perfectly.\n\nKC. Bingham Nottinghamshire\n\nReceived our cat flat today as promised .very pleased with it. I think my cat \"mr bb\" likes it as well. Many thanks\n\nJM. Rayne (Essex)\n\nI recieved my flat cats yesterday and they are up and in use. I just wanted to thank you for such a good shopping experience and to tell you how pleased I am with your product, they work brilliantly and fit perfectly. Many thanks and best wishes.\n\nSN. Ipswich\n\nHiya...Received and fitted...great product! Cheers...\n\nGP. Hitchin\n\nDear flat cat\n\nI was very impressed with your web site.....it is clear and to the point and the videos really help to understand your product\n\nI was impressed again when i phoned to ask about an inward opening window....you patiently talk me through the concept and measurments\n\nAnd now i have recieved my order ....3 days later..,.and it is excellent..,simple and effective at a very reasonable price\n\nIf only more people ran their buisnesss as well as you guys\n\nSR. Llandudno\n\nThanks Dominic, it's just what I wanted! Now waiting for another really hot day so I can have a cool bedroom with the window open and no visitations from neighbouring cats.\n\nWill recommend to you other bungalow dwellers. Thanks again for speedy, personal service.\n\nMS. Lancaster\n\n(Note Madeleine above wanted to keep cats out rather than keep them in !)\n\nJust wanted to show you that the flat cat is up and seems to be doing its job!\n\nSC. Norwich\n\nMany thanks for our flat cat. We are very pleased with it and cannot commend your service enough, for a custom size we were pleasantly surprised to receive it so promptly.\n\nSB. Eastleigh, Hampshire\n\nThanks Dominic, They arrived yesterday. I received them after work and had them in place by 7pm. I cannot thank you enough for your brilliant service. I have already been “ spreading the word” so hope that you manage to get more orders through my recommendation. The fit is excellent, particularly considering that my windows have handles which protrude very close to the corner of the windows. I will attach a photo to illustrate how well they fit. I am glad that I went with the 50mm fixings as it allows me to get plenty of “ contact” in the corners next to the handles. I had looked, on the net, at a couple of much more expensive and more ”rigid“ alternatives to the Flat Cats and I am confident that neither of them would have done the job anything like as well. You have a very satisfied customer.\n\nSC. Cinderford\n\nJust letting you know the new set arrived this morning and they fit perfectly, we don't feel like we're trapped in a third floor greenhouse any more! Thanks so much for your kindness, you don't know how much it's appreciated. I'll certainly recommend your site to everyone.\n\nEM. Cardiff\n\nSorry it's taken me a while but wanted to say thank you for the flat cat :). As luck would have it the day it arrived the weather has changed and gone rather bad so had no chance to try it for a week or so ... But I can now report that it fits and works perfectly and Phoebe loves it!\n\nJM. London\n\nA huge thank you. I have recived my Flat Cats today, excellent quality and so easy to fit.\n\nThank you for your fantastic customer care.\n\nSW. Brough (Yorkshire)\n\nJust wanted to let you know I received them yesterday, I am very impressed! Humphrey (kitten) has not moved from the window since I put them up and loves feeling the breeze through his whiskers :) but most importantly I am completely confident that he can't get out! Also thank you for helping with sizes. I shall definitely be buying more for rest of windows.\n\nPC. Maidstone\n\nHumphrey from Maidstone\n\nJust to let you know I bought a custom flat cat from you about a month ago. I bought this for a very different reason to most of your customers, it was for keeping my cat out. My cat is a constant hunter and during the night he will jump out the top window onto our extension roof and he has been known to jump back in with a dead rat in his mouth. Needless to say I had to keep the window permanently shut. I debated as to whether your flat cat would work and I'm pleased to say that it's fantastic. He doesn't try to jump in or out the window anymore. I'm so pleased to be able to have my window open at night again. Just thought you might be interested in case you ever had any queries asking if your product was suitable for keeping card out. Thank you so much.\n\nLK. Romford\n\nJust to say thank u sooooooo much for my fantastic Flat Cats they fitted really easily and are purfect, excuse the pun. Teddie my 6 month old Bengal kitten is in heaven. sniffing the fresh air in safety. Custom made to my sizes they are exactly right. Thank u for great product and customer service.\n\nKH and Teddie. Maidenhead\n\nJust an e-mail to say thanks for shipping the Flat Cats so quickly, they fitted perfectly and make such a difference to be able to have the windows open safely in the warmer weather, Thanks again.\n\nMB. Camberley, Surrey\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nAll perfect - Mooch not impressed but I am! I've been howled at a lot today. Will be ordering more for the other windows once I get round to measuring.\n\nSH. Bromley, Kent\n\nWe received the flat cats today. They really are great.\n\nI've attached a picture to show one of my cats enjoying it too.\n\nPR. Luton\n\nThanks for completing so quickly. I'm working from home today and just taken delivery of my order. Held one up to the window and the sizing is spot on. Thanks once again\n\nDH. Sheffield\n\nWant to say a big thank you for my Flat Cat. My cat loves it, sits in front of it and look at the world. And I don't have to worry that it might escape. I will recommend to my cat owners' friends.\n\nMS. Hove\n\nIts up and fitted and they are arguing already. Thank you x\n\nCS Nelson, Caerphilly\n\nMr Bibbins and Wilf say thank you very much for their lovely fresh air, they're just trying to figure out how to get past that pesky netting!\n\nThe nets fit perfectly and seem to be stuck fast... I am not putting anything past Mr B and will remain nervous of leaving the windows open whilst we're asleep, for example, given how fast he flies around the flat when he's in a lively mood, but, as you can see: so far so good. My doubts lie as much with the window frames themselves falling out as they do with the Flat Cats failing to be honest, ie. I am just paranoid! ;-) Many thanks,\n\nAB West Byfleet, Surrey\n\njust to let you know I purchased a Flat Cats screen a few months ago. As we had discussed my window opened inwards but with a little modification it has worked perfectly! My kitten Funkhouser loves to sit in the breeze and it even keeps flies out. Thanks very much for an excellent product. (See image below of the Flat Cats in action)\n\nJF Sutton (Surrey)\n\nPut both flat cats up, Lola blue is investigating the bedroom one but its v nice having fresh air in the flat as have both windows open in lounge & flat and haven't been ale to do that for a while. Thanks.\n\nKB. London N8\n\nMorning! The screens arrived yesterday, they are fantastic!!!! Thanks very much :-)\n\nKC. Ingatestone\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to say thank you so much for the help you gave me with this, your customer service was 100% brilliant from start to finish. The screens look fantastic, the quality is great and I couldn't be happier - and neither could the kittens! They are definitely Bengal proof! Thank you so much again. I won't hesitate to recommend Flat Cats to anyone.\n\nES. Ilford\n\nJust wanted to say that the Flat cat arrives in very good time and we are really pleased with it! Our two kittens are safe and well in our flat! Thunder in particular has used it to scale the window! Gave us a fright but the Flat Cat didnt move!\n\nWhen we return to the UK we will be ordering more for our UK place!\n\nPL. Hong Kong\n\nI just wanted to let you know, we received the flat cats today and fitted them all without a problem.\n\nI've attached a picture of the boys enjoying them already. Two very happy cats and two very happy owners!\n\nThanks for all your help. I'll definitely be passing your name on. I've already been bragging about them on facebook this morning!\n\nKC. Basildon\n\nOnce again, thank you for inventing Flat Cats and making them available for the needy. By the way, the builder who is responsible for managing this rental property saw it the other day, and was full of praise - said it was very professional, attractive, and found the solution pretty ingenious. So there you go - your karma is good.\n\nSG. London\n\nJust a quick note to say we received the flat cats - installed and have wonderful fresh air coming through the window without the fear of our cat falling out - they do exactly what it says on the tin! ;0)\n\nAW. Eastleigh\n\nWow! What a relief your invention is!! It arrived today and it's just taken me all of 5 minutes to fit! Splat is obsessed with the sights and smells I doubt I'll get her down from the window now!\n\nCW. Chelmsford\n\nI have literally just received my flat cats today and put them up a few hours ago. My Maine coon loves them!! Can't get enough of the breeze in this hot weather. Such good value for money, excellent and very friendly service, I am thinking of purchasing some more for the rest of my flat, would definitely recommend this company any day x\n\nCJ. Bracknell\n\nJust wanted to let you know that we received the Flat Cats yesterday. They fit brilliantly, Mia is happy to sit on the window sill and watch the world go by and my partner and I no longer feel as if we are living in a sauna! Thank you so much for all you help and advice, it is very much appreciated and I will have no hesitation in recommending you.\n\nCF. Gravesend\n\nFlatCat arrived and its perfect down to the mm! Kitty is really loving the breeze as you can see :-) I really do love them, its such a simple clever thing that makes a real difference to my cats day, as she is home alone and pretty bored until i get back so she loves spying on the neighbours now :) Someone from the cat charity i do work for ordered day before yesterday as well, he will be super impressed!\n\nCJ. Liverpool\n\nthey arrived today...thank u so much :o) love them!!\n\nDG. Morcambe\n\nJust to let you know that our Flat Cats are now all in place & working perfectly. Their quality & your service both excellent!\n\nCT. Bridgnorth\n\nJust a note thank you for your personal help and prompt execution of the order for my daughter’s cat. Pip no longer hits his nose on the net but loves the fresh air and taste of outdoors that the panels offer.\n\nCR. London\n\nThank you for the speedy delivery. Titus the cat has tried climbing up the mesh but it has defeated him so far and all is intact. Such a simple and unobtrusive solution, and we are both enjoying the fresh air!\n\nAM. Haslemere\n\nThank you so much for such personal service and help. I ordered the screens on Wednesday and by Friday evening they are in place. I am appreciating the breeze tonight with open windows and have some very happy cats flat out on the window sills. Have told the head rehoming manager at Celia Hammond Animal Trust about them as there may some potential adopters/fosterers who need to secure their windows before having a cat (or more) from the charity\n\nJD. London\n\nHi Dominic, The flat cats arrived yesterday, took about 5 min to sort out and fix to two of the living room windows. Very easy install. Thank You so much, I’m cooler, the cats are cooler, we are all happy. If you ever get back to Birmingham, give me a call, pop in and have a coffee and meet the tribe.\n\nTC. Sutton Coldfield\n\nHello - I would just like to say thank you very much for the product - it is just wonderful to have the windows open again without my cat jumping out. Whoever designed this product - thank you.\n\nBC. Prestatyn\n\nThankyou for the flat cats they are very good and fantastically easy to fit. We live in a flat with two fully grown ragamuffin cats. We were afraid to open the windows too far before, so in summer we all got a bit too hot. This is a perfect solution. Even though one of our cats keeps getting his claw stuck in the mesh, you think he would learn.\n\nJH. Cupar\n\nI just wanted to say thank you so much for your kind assistance in the ordering of my flat cat screens. They have arrived (very promptly! Thank you!) and i have successfully installed one in the bed room so far. I thought i would see the reception it received from my girl Tuppence first before doing the rest. Well, i really am so impressed with the product as she sniffed around a bit at first but has so far not clawed or shown a great deal of interest other than sitting by a now fully open window which makes all our lives a lot more comfortable! I am so so happy that we can do this now without worrying about her it is fantastic and i will be following on putting the others up shortly. I am not sure how long it will be until i have to replace the velcro sticky as i seem to have quite a narrow window frame but i am more than happy if that is the only small issue i have. Thank you so much again and believe me i will be passing on your good name!\n\nNP. Basildon\n\nJust letting you know, everything arrived safe. Thanks very much for the quick turnaround. I, my cats and my overheating computer are very grateful!\n\nKB. Warlingham\n\nHi Dominic. Just wanted to send you a quick email to let you know that the widow guards came today and I'm over the moon with them! And they couldn't have come at a better time with all this heat we've been getting recently. Thanks again for my wonderful purchase\n\nNH. Gillingham\n\nI just wanted to say how brilliant the flat cats are! They fit perfectly and our cats are able to go and sit by the window smelling the fresh air without us freaking out that they are going to fall out! They don’t seem to bothered by the mesh either and seem to know that they cant push up against it, they haven’t tried to pull at it or anything. Thanks so much, these are an absolute godsend in this hot weather and given that we are 18 floors up they are an absolute must!!\n\nEM. London\n\nOur custom Flat Cat screens arrived on Friday afternoon. – they’re very well made, a great fit, and work a treat!\n\nThank you so much for all your help with our slightly-out-of-the-ordinary custom request – we are very happy with the result and appreciate your very high level of customer service. Our cat likes the screen too - attached is a photo of him enjoying the fresh summer breeze (and the tantalising proximity of a plump woodpigeon :)\n\nSM & MM. Amsterdam\n\nAll received, fitted and working like a charm. I will be ordering more!\n\nAC. Buntingford\n\nThank you so much for such a great service. Your help in advising what sizes i would need was very much appreciated. The flat cats arrived super quick, were a perfect fit and were very easy to install. My very nervous, timid cat who doesnt want to go outside now enjoys sitting on the window sill feeling the breeze and watching the birds. I also get the added benefit of some fresh air in the house without being plagued by insects. The cat tried to \"pat\" a bird through the mess today and got her claw stuck, i have to report that the mesh stayed securely attached to the window and did not tear as she pulled herself free. So perfect all round, thank you\n\nAJB. Farnham\n\nThank you for such honourable customer service. You will come highly reccomended to everyone that I know who will benefit from your fab invention\n\nHM. Godalming\n\nIt's perfect! Thank you\n\nCL. London\n\nMany thanks for the prompt delivery of our two custom made Flat Cats.\n\nI have just fitted them to our windows; they are a perfect fit and so easy to put up.\n\nWe have always adopted older special needs indoor cats who have never shown any interest in our large open windows. However our new addition Tilly - a 9 month old indoor cat has bundles of energy and curiosity so we are so grateful to have found your website offering the perfect solution. We can now fling our windows open wide again and hope for some sunshine this summer. Many many thanks for all your help.\n\nJM. Liverpool\n\nI have just received my Flat cats today Saturday 07th July and they fit perfectly. I will be contacting you again sometime next month to order at least another two. Once again many thanks for your quick service.\n\nEH. Maidenhead\n\nMy name is Stacey and I purchased 3 custom Flat Cats from you a few weeks ago. I am so impressed! The delivery was fast and I put them up straightaway and they fit perfectly. It's so nice having fresh air in my flat and my cats are really interested in all the new smells coming in. I don't know if you remember speaking to me on the phone but I'd like to thank you for your help and professionalism, your customer service is amazing. You have a company and a product to be proud of and I've already recommended you to other cat owners and told all my friends and family about Flat Cats. So thank you very much!\n\nSA. Chepstow, Monmouthshire\n\nI've attached some pictures of my Neville and Giggsy enjoying the sun and open window in the living room for you to see. Just to say thank you, as you can see our cats love their new screen. I was a bit sceptical about these at first but they really are brill...easy to fir and discreet- you can hardly see them.\n\nKW. Manchester\n\nHi Dominic, Just wanted to let you know that our screen is a huge hit with our three cats. After a lot of bemused looks and sniffing they are enjoying the breeze as they chill out at the door. It's been lovely to have the door open while it's so warm, only wish we'd got the screen sooner!\n\nRW. Brockworth, Gloucester\n\nThank you Dominic for my flat cats. With the hot weather and my little baby can be cool in the day. They fit perfectly on my windows. And good thing I called you to make them 1cm short, good thing that happened.\n\nI live in a top flat (3rd floor) and my flat cats blend in, I have white windows but I preferred the grey to look through, and my windows are massive to a little cat, so I’m very happy with them. And bonus they keep the flies and mozzys out.\n\nFor anyone thinking about buying flat cats from the genius that is Dominic, do it, you’ll never regret it, it’s one investment in life that is worth it.\n\nRP. Belvedere, Kent\n\nMany thanks for our window blinds we can all breathe again thank goodness. Pictures of our babies sent separately . Payment made for my office one.\n\nAM. Lowestoft, Suffolk\n\nThank you very much. The standard flat cats are fabulous. Safe and sound at home :)\n\nSK. Chelmsford, Essex\n\nThank you so much for the two standard flat cats. They are brilliant!!! Such a great idea and so easy to put up. We can finally keep the windows open knowing our cats are safe. Our one cat is quite a curious one and he tried but couldn't get it off :) Such a great product! Picture below of Ninja :)\n\nBF. Carshalton, Surrey\n\nJust wanted to say many thanks for my flat cats. Such a simple idea really but so effective. I can now get fresh air into my flat without worrying about my ragdolls jumping out the windows. They really appreciate them too and love sitting by the open windows. Indeed, if I close them the babies sit at them and miaow to get them open again. I hardly notice the netting over the windows, and when I do take it down, the velcro is almost invisible on the window frames, all of which is good news.\n\nLG. Bracknell, Berkshire\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for the recent order. Very straight forward to order. Clear instructions. Very easy to put on the window.......even for me. Very pleased with the appearance on the window. I'm now going to do a bit of measuring and order more. Thank you\n\nLD. Littlehampton\n\nJoanna sent in this picture of Elsie, it does not show her Flat Cat but we thought it was just to cute not to publish (Dominic)...\n\nHere’s Elsie in a porridge box, in the cupboard… where else!!!\n\nI just wanted to contact you to say thank you for your amazing product. I have never had an indoor cat before and no idea how difficult it could be!! However your product has made my life so easy, the wether at the moment makes your product essential, I recommend flat cats to everyone\n\nRT. Chichester\n\nThank god for my window mesh! Freddie enjoying the small bit of air on these hot nights!\n\nDC. Basingstoke, Hampshire\n\nArthur is rather frustrated he can’t abscond, I’m very happy the flies are out, the Cat is in and I have fresh air\n\nSJ.

All my screens are up and working perfectly!\n\nLG. St Ives, Cambridgeshire\n\nHi Dominic, The new cover arrived and fits perfectly.. thank you very much my boys will enjoy them for sure. Strange how the weather has changed since the new ones arrived..mind you it’s much more bearable isn’t it.\n\nPS. St Leonard's on Sea\n\nWishing you continued success and lots of business. When I get some good shots of boys At the Windows I will forward\n\nBy the way, many thanks for your products - they are beautifully made and do the job perfectly! We couldn’t be happier! Essential for us and our kittens in the warm weather!\n\nRY. Billingshurst, West Sussex\n\nHi Dominic, just thought I'd let you know how pleased I am with my recent order. It took about 10 minutes to put in place, so very easy.\n\nIt took two days for my cat to get used to it being there and it's absolutely wonderful being able to have the window open all night, especially during the recent heat waves.\n\nI have already sung my praises of FlatCats to my anyone who will listen lol. I will definitely come to you again if I decide get any more\n\nSL. Folkestone, Kent\n\nThank you so much. The picture attached is the first time we have had the window open in over a week!!! We can finally stop sweating!\n\nMike and Abi in Plymouth\n\nHi Dominic, Thank you so much for our flat cats - they've made such a difference! I just tried to post on Facebook but it's not playing ball at the moment, so I thought I'd email instead. Feel free to share this if you like: Really pleased with our flat cats - having some windows open after so long struggling through the heatwave feels amazing! Dominic's customer service was excellent and the products arrived exactly as expected. Surprisingly, the cats haven't tried to climb them yet but even if they did I'm pretty confident that they couldn't pull them off. Thank you Dominic!\n\nGB. Ipswich, Suffolk\n\nEgg enjoying his Flat Cat. Sent in by Clare from Romford, Essex\n\nWe just wanted to let you know that your screens are simply great, and the cats love it please see attached picture. It is easy to install, robust and aesthetic\n\nG&M H. London SW18\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. Please find my reference and picture. \"Flat cats was an immediate solution to a real problem. Easy to install and amazing service. Highly recommend\"\n\nLW Hurstpierpoint\n\nToday I received my twin pack of standard window covers. I am so pleased that someone recommended your product on the Gransnet Forum, when I mentioned my Kamikaze cat preventing me from opening my upstairs windows. Today after fixing them I have had my bedroom windows open for the first time for many years! Thank you so much, the strength and quality are such that I trust their protection. My cat just enjoyed the fresh air but didn't touch the mesh\n\nSW Oxford\n\nHi Dominic many thank for door screen perfect as usual . Really happy 😊. Devon Rex loves it she can be even more nosey than usual . Will be ordering again in future as I will be moving to France.\n\nKM. Slough\n\nHi There, Got my order within 4 days, very pleased with it and it works! I have 3 foster cats and they love it, they sit for hours now getting fresh air and watching the birds.\n\nI have recommended your site to others in Ireland so hopefully you will get lots of orders …\n\nSC. Dublin, Ireland\n\nHi Dominic, Thank you so much for the screens. I realise it's quite some time since we had a rather lengthy conversation with regards measurements and how the screens would fit on my windows. I really did appreciate your patience. As the sun has finally made an appearance - I have now put my screens up allowing me to open my beautiful sash windows. The puds seem happy with them and I am extremely happy with how they fit - look and I can now let in all the sun and fresh air without worrying about my babies escaping or hurting themselves. I will recommend your services at any opportunity.\n\nJC. Dukinfield, Cheshire\n\nThank you again Dominic already we're seeing the benefits of our kitchen ones. I'll send you a picture of Jessie watching the world go by. Feel free to use on your Facebook or website. I've shared with my cat friends so expect enquiries soon.\n\nCB. Crawley, West Sussex\n\nHi Dominic, I hope you are well! My Dad arrived with my FlatCats parcel this weekend, and I have to say they are very excellent! Mr Cat spent most of the weekend sat in front of the open window or sleeping -I think from sensory overload! He seems to be absolutely fine with them, and I feel safe to go ahead and measure up some of his other \"favourite Windows\" for this months purchase. Thank you so much again - Mr Cat is safe (and as an added bonus, the wasps are kept out!)\n\nHB. Hailsham, East Sussex\n\nReceived the Flat Cats and now fitted, Amazing product, just what we wanted.\n\nTP.

As you can see how high we are, I think Simon will enjoy feeling the breeze against his whiskers!\n\nKB. Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire\n\nDear Dominic, Thank you for your excellent, and rapid, service! I am very much looking forward to using my product and seeing how Mr Cat deals with them! With kind regards,\n\nHB. Hailsham\n\nHi Dominic, Thanks so much for my flat cats which arrived today,they fit perfectly! I'm so pleased,thanks for being so friendly and helpful on the phone.

Thank you so much!\n\nBest wishes and I hope your business continues to grow!\n\nAS. Wellingborough\n\nMy husband put them up last night and they are very secure.\n\nI can't see my two kitten brothers escaping from these.\n\nI am delighted to endorse your product, and you have my permission to use and print this review for customer feedback. Thank you for everything you did to help me including the fitting advice and measurement. I can now look forward to getting fresh air into my apartment in the warmer Summer months.\n\nJR. Dunblane, Perthshire\n\nYour customer service and dedication to satisfaction is second to none.\n\nDominic This morning I received the new screen for my back door-which is a very good fit. Thank you for the very prompt service. My three Burmese cats are now sitting at the door watching the birds and enjoying the fresh air. I am happy as I know the cats are safe from traffic and other dangers. Thank you a great product and such prompt service\n\nRB. New Malden, Surrey\n\nSorry for the delay in coming back to you, crazy couple of weeks! Thank you and please thank your ladies - it's absolutely perfect and I'm delighted with it!\n\nMB. Belfast, Antrin, Northern Ireland\n\nHi Dominic, I have had my screens up a few weeks now. I have to say I am delighted with them. The first thing our cat did was to check they were attached at the top and she hasn't worried about them since. Our cat loves the window open and I don't have to worry about her falling off the window ledge on the top floor or any nasty cats getting in the bottom window. It is quite see through so don't worry about taking it off. It will be great through summer - keeps spiders out too.\n\nJK. Harrogate, North Yorkshire\n\nHi Dominic, My Flat Cats arrived yesterday and oh my gawsh they have made such a big difference to the temperature inside my apartment. As you can imagine, the Aussie summer is pretty hot as it is so not being able to open any windows this summer has made my apartment an over-sized oven!\n\nSuki (my cat) is a little disappointed she hasn't yet worked out how she can create an escape to chase the birds... I think she may be eternally disappointed about that unfortunately. Have attached a pic of her showing her disappointment. Thank you so much for your amazing customer service, speedy turnaround and for such a great product. I'm pretty sure I will need to organise some more screens in the not too distant future and would recommend you/Flat Cats to anyone in a heartbeat. Regards,\n\nHF. Balgowlah, New South Wales, Australia\n\nHi Dominic, I just wanted to say the flat cats are brilliant and the custom one fits the door perfectly. Thank you!\n\nKD. Shirley, Southampton\n\nI just wanted you to know that I am delighted with the 3 flat cats I ordered from you. They arrived v quickly and were so easy to put up. They have made 2 cats very happy sitting on the windowsill sniffing in the sea air! I will order some custom ones for all our other windows in the spring. Thank you very much\n\nJE. Eastbourne\n\nHi Dominic, A huge thanks for your great customer service and speedy delivery of the two flat-cats for our upstairs windows. We fitted them this evening and I am sitting here enjoying some lovely cool air. Did you ever receive the photographs I sent you of the French door flat cat? It's amazing!\n\nLL. Hemel Hempstead\n\nThank you for organising the flat cats that arrived today, fit perfectly and easy to install! We are so pleased and will know where to come when we do the larger Windows.\n\nSL. Hurst, Berkshire\n\nI just wanted to say that this has been a life/sanity saver and I have recommended you to so many people. We have been able to let our two new pedigree cats have the experience of smells of the outside while we have also benefited from being able to have our door open in the heat. Thanks again\n\nLB. Chesterfield\n\nHi Dominic, Now we have had our flat cats up for a few weeks just wanted to say thank you so much for all your help, they work amazingly well! We have had a few friends comment on them and are thinking about getting some and we are now thinking of more also! Once one window is open in a room we just want them all haha!!\n\nCV. Aylesford, Kent\n\nJust to let you know I have fitted the window one and it's a great success for both of us, thank you. I have yet to fit the one on the conservatory door but I know it will be the same. Thank you so much. Another happy customer! I will no doubt be in touch again for more window ones. I have already recommended you and sent your link to the Blue Cross where I adopted my cat although they surely must know you already.\n\nJR. Winchester Hampshire\n\nHey! Just wanted to say our screen is up and working a treat, thanks for all your help thought you may like some images for your site! We love it as do our cats, Marvin and Tiger Tim! It helps keep our flat cool and our cats safe!\n\nSK. London E9\n\nDear Dominic, We just had to write and tell you how much fun we are having with our new Flat-Cats. We can now sit and stare at every human and doggy that passes by our windows. The smell of fresh air is exhilarating and listening to all those new noises is amazing. And our mummy loves it too! We can now sit, smell and watch the garden through the patio door without going out into it. She was worried that we’d get out of the window and door and possibly get run over by a bus or car, or even worse that someone may take us because we are so pretty and handsome. We are being very naughty and using the flat-cat as a climbing frame, but it holds our weight of two Siamese cats. Keep up the amazing good work. Lots of puurrrrfect love Cleopatra and Sparticus (and mummy TW London) Photo on its way. The patio door Flat Cat is perfect. Thank you so much Dominic.\n\nTW. East Finchley, London\n\nI purchased two flat cats at the end of the season last year.I didn't use them as the weather turned colder.I just wanted you to know this year during the warm weather they have been in use and are great.Our cat still can't make out why she is close to freedom,but loves looking out safely on the world. A wonderful invention well done.\n\nWS. Bristol, Avon\n\nJust to let it arrived today its up and ready to go.. and I am pretty impressed and I think even my most boisterous cat has his work cut out trying to get through that!\n\nAJ. Hove, East Sussex\n\nHi there, just wanted to say a massive thank you for my window screens, really hot weather at the moment and finally able to enjoy a welcome breeze in my lounge. I have really tall windows and get a bit wobbly at the top of a ladder so instead of fixing the hook side of the velcro to the window frame first I stuck it to the loop strip on the screen and then stuck it all up at the same time...is all lovely and secure and matches up perfectly :) Saved an extra few trips to the top of the ladder! Thanks again, happy kitten mum\n\nEF. Hove, East Sussex\n\nFlat cats up and running! So wonderful to have the fresh air coming in AND have the Two Tabbies safe inside. Such an uncomplicated, effective solution! Lots of twitching of feline noses. They didn't make much of it the first time, but the next day Toffee 'told' me she wanted the screen up by dabbing her nose on the window and recoiling in surprise as if to say 'Why is the glass still here? Wasn't like this yesterday!' I'm really pleased with how see-through it is.\n\nThank you!\n\nJT. Barton-Upon-Humber, Lincolnshire\n\nThank you so much for my Flat Cats. They're perfect & Layla likes them too!\n\nJP. Bournmouth\n\nThey have arrived and I'm so very happy with them! I've attached a picture of our cat Kobe enjoying the breeze on such a lovely day. Please feel free to use wherever you wish to. I will be writing a review on google and sharing these fantastic creations on Kobe's Instagram and on our Facebook for our fellow cat friends if that's ok?Have you thought about tapping in with local breeders? A lot of pedigree cat breeders prefer their buyers to keep the cats as indoor cats so it would be fantastic if they advocated your product.
