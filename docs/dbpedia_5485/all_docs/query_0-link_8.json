        "text": "A Curious Phenomenon Called ‚ÄòEtak‚Äô\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.\n\nBut I‚Äôm talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.\n\nToday, I‚Äôd like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world‚Äôs first practical vehicle navigation system.\n\nHere‚Äôs a picture of it:\n\nAt the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley‚Äôs San Jose Mercury News said about it:\n\nThe Etak Navigator launched 39 years (!) ago in 1985. üò±\n\nBack then Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war.\n\nAnd it was the year Steven Spielberg released the film ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\nAnd I‚Äôm sure at that time many of you were but a twinkle in your mother‚Äôs eye‚Ä¶\n\nBack in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother‚Äôs map of Los Angeles:\n\nAs you can see, the maps weren‚Äôt always pretty. By today‚Äôs standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there.\n\nSo, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.\n\nIt immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:\n\nNearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.\n\nMost important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see ‚Äú12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 ‚Äî Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?‚Äú)\n\nBefore GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‚Äòdead reckoning‚Äò. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.\n\nTo solve this problem Etak invented ‚Äòaugmented dead reckoning‚Äô. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you‚Äôre driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‚Äòsnapped‚Äô back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today.\n\nLike all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.\n\nThe second key invention was a ‚Äòheading up‚Äô, moving map display. This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.\n\nThird: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‚Äògeocoding‚Äô.\n\nHere is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action:\n\nAs you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.\n\nThe buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.\n\nThe top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.\n\nThe address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection. You could also store common locations like home and work.\n\nThe Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.\n\nThese were soft programmed depending on the current function.\n\nIn the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:\n\nAnd after that you simply selected the street from a list:\n\nThis is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:\n\nNote that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.\n\nThe lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!\n\nEtak Navigator System Details\n\nThere were five key components to the Etak Navigator:\n\nThe first was a vector CRT display ‚Äî similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.\n\nThe navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8‚Ä≥) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80‚Ä≥) per second!\n\nThere was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.\n\nTo determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.\n\nFinally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.\n\nThe cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called ‚ÄúEtak Maps‚Äù. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:\n\nThe original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:\n\nThat‚Äôs the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.\n\nOn top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.\n\nJust Some of the Technical Hurdles\n\nBack in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.\n\nGPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.\n\nIn addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn‚Äôt store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly.\n\nThe most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass.\n\nHere the solution was topological map matching.\n\nThis invention, above all others, made the product viable.\n\nAnother issue was data storage and latency.\n\nThe cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times.\n\nThe dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape.\n\nYears later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak‚Äôs highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps.\n\nAnother problem was heat.\n\nUsers commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot.\n\nYou can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:\n\nHowever, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate.\n\nYet another problem was dealing with inclines.\n\nThe map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.\n\nTo compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak‚Äôs lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well!\n\nAnother problem were magnetic anomalies.\n\nBridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.\n\nThe positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn‚Äôt quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!\n\nThe system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster.\n\nIn 1985 there wasn‚Äôt the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.\n\nInstead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors.\n\nThus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.\n\nWhat about the digital map?\n\nEtak had to create it ‚Äî more or less from scratch.\n\nOriginally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called GBF DIME files (which predated TIGER). But they were stick maps and didn‚Äôt contain any shape to the roads.\n\nEtak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.\n\nTo reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‚ÄòUSGS quads‚Äô as a reference.\n\nEach map was photographed onto 10‚Äù transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner.\n\nThe entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer. This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today‚Äôs dollars.\n\nThis little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:\n\n4 map digitizing workstations\n\nThe engineers developing and compiling code\n\nBatch jobs to process and compile all the map data\n\nThe company admins who used it for word processing\n\nThis was the coding environment:\n\nA dumb monochrome terminal.\n\nYou edited code using the ‚Äòvi‚Äô editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile.\n\nThe jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run ‚Ä¶ which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy).\n\nThe map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:\n\nEach digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19‚Äù monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends.\n\nThe map editing system was the first ever to use ‚Äòheads up‚Äô digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes ‚Äî especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‚ÄòEnvironmental Systems Research Institute‚Äò ‚Äî i.e. a gentleman called Jack Dangermond who I‚Äôm sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. üòâ\n\nBefore this invention people used to digitize ‚Äòblind‚Äô using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone.\n\nEtak‚Äôs map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top. The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:\n\nThe Amazing Team Behind It\n\nEtak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, Stan Honey.\n\nStan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills.\n\nBefore founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at SRI International in Menlo Park, California.\n\nStan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America‚Äôs Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America‚Äôs Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second!\n\nThe original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, Nolan Bushnell, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.\n\nNolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari.\n\nThe story is recounted by Benj Edwards in his fantastic article for Fast Company: ‚ÄúWho Needs GPS? The Forgotten Story of Etak‚Äôs Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System‚Äú:\n\n[Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one‚Äôs current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn‚Äôt need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen.\n\nNolan reaction: ‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs do that and I‚Äôll fund it‚Äù\n\nNolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You‚Äôve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‚ÄòJapanese,‚Äô then ‚Äòcheap,‚Äô then ‚Äògood sushi.‚Äô The box takes over and guides you to a place.‚Äù\n\nOne of Etak‚Äôs key hires was Marv White. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.\n\nUnder Marv‚Äôs direction Etak‚Äôs map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard. Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.\n\nThere were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many of whom previously worked at SRI International: Ken Milnes, George Loughmiller and Alan Philips to name a few.\n\nMany of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni.\n\nSo What Happened to Etak?\n\nThe Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)\n\nInstead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‚ÄòPersonal Navigation Device‚Äô from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born.\n\nDuring the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs News Corporation. It was News Corps‚Äô John B. Evans that saw the potential.\n\nLike Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel‚Äôs Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in John‚Äôs obituary in the Guardian:\n\nThe defining deal of [John‚Äôs] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch‚Äôs US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.\n\nIn the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers‚Äô views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems.\n\nIt was thus that John had the vision to use Etak‚Äôs maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak.\n\nStan Honey recounts the conversations:\n\nJohn instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of ‚Äúwhere is the nearest?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do I get to it?‚Äù. Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience. I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often. Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee‚Äôd up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I‚Äôd always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls. I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch‚Äôs radar screen without John Evans‚Äô vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak. At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion. Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp‚Äôs acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.\n\nJohn really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell. During the Etak days, both would visit and ‚Äúwind-up‚Äù the Etak crew with their predictions. That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open. But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are. It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened. It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.\n\nBut the times there are a changin‚Äô: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened.\n\nNews Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now TomTom:\n\nBut Why the name ‚ÄòEtak‚Äô?\n\nThe answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.\n\nThey imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them.\n\nIn the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it‚Äôs the maps that move past the vehicle‚Ä¶\n\nWith that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points.\n\nBut Wait, There is One More Thing‚Ä¶\n\nWhen you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something?\n\nHave you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?\n\nDoes it look familiar? Well, of course it does ‚Ä¶\n\nSo it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak.\n\nBut why did Etak use that particular symbol?\n\nIf you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he‚Äôll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nBecause Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn‚Äôt burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car ‚Äî üöó ‚Äî required too many lines. It also didn‚Äôt clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed.\n\nLegend has it that one of Etak‚Äôs engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari‚Äôs latest games. And that game was‚Ä¶\n\nAnd what symbol did Asteroids use for their spaceship?\n\nAnd thus the symbol for vehicle navigation was born and is still used by all navigation apps globally today:\n\nSo There You Have It‚Ä¶\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.\n\nEtak‚Äôs many significant inventions included:\n\nthe world‚Äôs first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked\n\naugmented dead reckoning using map matching\n\nmoving map heads up display\n\nfirst use of geocoding in a consumer application\n\nalgorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval\n\nheads up digitizing\n\nthe world‚Äôs first high volume digital map production system\n\ninventor of the universal map navigation symbol\n\nI was but a pimply engineer at the time. Little did I know when I joined Etak in 1985 that I was going to be part of such an illustrious team.\n\nMy hats off and best wishes to everyone I worked with: it was a privilege, an honor and an amazing journey. Thank you.\n\nAcknowledgements, Further Reading & Watching"
