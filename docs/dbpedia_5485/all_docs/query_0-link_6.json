        "text": "How many Gauss is a magnet?\n\nWe're often asked if a magnet “has 10,000 Gauss.” This is a bit of a strange question, since Gauss is a unit of magnetism that can apply to different measurements or magnet properties. A magnet doesn't have one specific amount of Gauss in it. Two common measurements expressed in Gauss are The Residual Flux Density, Br, and the Surface Field.\n\nResidual Flux Density, Br, is the magnetic induction remaining in a saturated magnetic material after the magnetizing field has been removed. Scroll down to the last section of this article for a more detailed explanation.\n\nThis number is a material property which is independent of the magnet shape. Grade N42 magnets have a Br of 13,200 Gauss, while N52 magnets can be as high as 14,800 Gauss. See our Specs page for more Br values for various neodymium magnet grades."
