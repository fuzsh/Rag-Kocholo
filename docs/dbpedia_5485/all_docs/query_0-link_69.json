        "text": "Hey all,\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve been active on COTH…had some babies, did some life stuff. We’ve tackled some financial goals and we are FINALLY working on our barn/pasture situation (which also means I’ll ahem be in the market soon for another Large Plain Bay. Don’t tell hubby.)\n\nI’ve got all the questions and would love tips for a) practicality and b) cost-effective. TIA!\n\nPasture:\n\nTop of the screenshot is North. The white area I’ve measured has just been cleared and tilled, so it’s fresh pure dirt right now (grass and fencing are next on our list). My assumption is that our perimeter fence line will follow that same basic shape. The ground gradually slopes SE, so that bottom right corner is basically a pond if we get enough rain. I also eyeballed these measurements so don’t take them to the bank. It’s roughly 2.5 acres in total.\n\nBarn:\n\nOld, two-story cattle barn. In general I’m fine keeping the layout but open to shifting some walls/doors if we decide it’s necessary. Most of the updates here are just cosmetic/functionality.\n\nRiding space. Do I want/need a dedicate “ring”? We’ve got a few trails through the rest of our property (not pictured), as well as our yard…I don’t want to trash that, but if I split time between there, inside the pasture, and trail work, my thought is I won’t tear up grass too badly in any one area. For reference, just talking about some pleasure riding, eventually finding a new OTTB to play with for some local/small shows. Not talking about multiple horses 6x/week of heavy riding.\n\nFences. Aside from the perimeter, hubby was talking about cross-fencing for rotation/sacrifice area. My goal is to have the stall open up directly into the pasture. Is there any merit to also fencing a small turnout/paddock between the stall and pasture? To allow a horse to go “out” but be able to confine them to the smaller area? Or is that “meh, nice but not necessary”?\n\nConsidering 3 strands of electric tape + solar charger. Experiences? Pros/cons? Brand/type recommendations?\n\nGates. I know not to put a gate in a corner. Aside from that, any tips/do’s/don’ts? Where do I want them?\n\nThere’s no water near the barn at all. Closest hook-up is the well pump in front of our house. Planning to run hoses for now (annoying, but oh well).\n\nAlso no electricity in the barn, so at minimum I’ll want some kind of (battery? solar?) lights for the aisle/stall area, and the tack room.\n\nManure: don’t plan on using the stalls much except for free access, so don’t think I’ll need to worry about designating a large area. Can just skip stall as needed and cart it to the woods. Is this naive?\n\nWhat have I not thought about yet? What are some LIFESAVERS that you couldn’t live without?\n\n*Disclaimer: I’ve spent the majority of my life having horses at home, but this is the first time we’re setting things up from scratch.\n\nFor your sacrifice lot… I have a 36’x110’ sacrifice area. At first I only had footing on 36’x50’. It was ok for 2 1/2 horses, but they really almost entirely hung out in the space that had footing. I added another 30’ of footing and that has provided them with more room to run around. I hope to be able to improve the last section with some more footing this year, but if it doesn’t happen it can wait. I have a section of my sacrifice area that is fenced off as a medical paddock. Right now it is set up so the pony can go in and out, but the horses can’t. That way he can eat his mash and visit with the big guys as he wants.\n\nWill you plan on having the horses having direct access to pastures from the barn/stall? If so, consider putting a lean to on your barn just over the stall entrances. That way the horses can have access to shelter without having to have stalls open. Mine were using the stalls as a toilet, so I wasn’t saving on shavings by having them be in and out at will… The lean to on the barn provides them with enough shelter and if the weather is nice they will leave the shelter to do urinate, but not always to poop.\n\nI have 2-ish acres of pasture, a larger one on one side of the sacrifice lot and a smaller one on the other side. I didn’t cross fence at first. In the 1 1/2 that I have had my horses home, I have adjusted the cross fencing. Some parts of the pasture are more productive than others. I now have the cross fencing so that I can rotate between 6 paddocks, 3 large and 3 smaller. I finally feel like the cross fencing is the best set up I can manage and am going to add 4 more gates to my sacrifice lot so that I can open and close gates from the sacrifice area to the individual paddocks with out having to deal with electric fence gates and an alley to the paddocks. I get 7-10 days from each of the large paddocks and 4-6 days on the smaller ones. This gives the each paddock 30 days to rest before they are grazed again. I drag and mow as early in the 30 day cycle as weather allows. During the winter, I have been rotating through the paddocks and feeding hay on the ground in piles (starting at the far end of the paddock and each time making piles closer to the barn). Once the entire paddock has been used for piles of hay, I rotate to the other and drag/mow as the weather/ground allows. When it is too wet to allow the horses in the paddocks, I feed hay under the run in/ lean to in large hay nets.\n\nIs your hubby handy? Would he feel comfortable running a ditch witch to did the trench? You could lay the water and electric in the same ditch. You could lay the pipe and wire (as long as you got the right type) yourself and then just get a plumber and electrician to do the final connections. They you guys could back fill the ditch. Just make sure you have enough room on your panel to run a tank de icer, a couple of led lights, and then room for a couple of outlets so you could run a fan and other items while you are at the barn. On a side note…if you CAN’T do the water/electric yet, you could check into running PEX pipe above ground to the barn. A friend of mine’s family ran water to their boat dock from their house at the river (middle peninsula of Virginia…pipes freeze regularly during the winter) through PEX and if was functional for 10+ years even with the exposure to sunlight and pipes freezing/thawing.\n\nAs far as riding space…You will be extremely limited if you don’t have a dedicated spot you don’t mind not having grass. Riding on grass places a tremendous stress on the grass and compacting the soil. Maybe your sacrifice area could be a small dressage court size and you could do double duty as a riding area when it’s too wet to ride the other areas. I have 80 acres of my own land to ride and 300 of an adjacent farm. When it is WET…I am VERY limited on where I can ride that won’t leave lasting damage. I am lucky that I have access to a place a couple miles away that has graveled logging roads and a state park that has horse trails that have solid footing.\n\nIf you have a sacrifice area, you will need to pick up manure and you will need somewhere to dump it. You want it to be far enough away from the barn that it won’t be an issue with flies, but also not so far that it is difficult to dump. A friend of mine’s manure pile is at the bottom of a hill. It’s a ways to go, but is easier to go down with a full wheel barrow than her closer option, which would be up a hill with a full wheelbarrow.\n\nPlace your larger access gates at a location that allows for equipment to get into them easily. Locate them in well draining areas, or add footing to keep them passable. Keep gates in line with one another is you are going from one pasture to sacrifice lot to pasture. Make sure they are as wide as you will ever need. Don’t forget that you can also add people pass throughs in the fence line so you don’t have to open and close gates all the time.\n\nBe sure your vet and farrier can get their vehicle to the barn. I know some folks who bring horses up to their house from the barn because access is an issue, but it becomes a problem when the horse is dead lame or terribly ill. Hay deliveries can be a struggle if you don’t have a solid road/path to the barn. I have a friend who has to really time her hay deliveries because of soft ground and no road to the barn. It can be very stressful at times and I’m sure her hay supplier, although understanding, gets frustrated as well.\n\nEh, I don’t have water & electric where my shed/pastures are, but it’s close enough to the house that I run hoses. One day I will dig a trench, but built this place 6 yrs ago & still haven’t done it, partly bc $, so it’s obviously not an emergency. I use 100 gal troughs, I hate buckets, so even in mid summer, I don’t have to fill them more than once a week. 2 horses.\n\nI run my fence (HG bipolar which I love so much for not having to ground) with a Stafix DC charger (which also has the option for AC power) connected to a deep cycle battery which is in turn charged by a solar panel. I really love this setup. I have plenty of sun, but even if I didn’t, the battery will run the fence for weeks on it’s own. I wrote up my original set up with my first charger, you just have to get past my rambling at the beginning of the post, heh. I do now have an AGM battery after my 1st battery reached the end of its life span after 5 years.\n\nhttp://www.teamflyingsolo.com/2014/1…r-in-your.html\n\nI found some nice solar lights for my feed shed & in the horse area, where my xties are, I have some really bright magnetic lights with rechargeable batteries (I bring them in the house about 1x a week they charge while I’m at work).\n\nETA - I ride in my top field on grass, no arena. It doesn’t cause any issues, but I am careful to constantly vary my track & move jumps/poles around often. I have good soil that drains well. My riding has way less impact than the grazing horses who play I’m A Rearing Mustang games, lol.\n\nI would say, yes to rotate if you can and definitely a run-in type spot between the stall and the pasture/paddock if you want access from stalls to the pasture.\n\nAlso… running underground water is way cheap and easy. Doing it makes life easier! I had water run to my barn by the guys building my house (and paid for it, oy!) because it was worth it to just get. it. done. I am, ahem, not handy, so I had to pay for it, but my Dad when he moved up later that year was able to run from barn to pastures in no time flat. It may have to come up when my arena goes in, depending on how far down the arena guy has to go down, which I was a little frowny about but my Dad waved his hand and pish-posh’ed it.\n\nAlso… you might want an arena. What if your horse is a spook or super green, or someone needs a rehab, or you decide to lease to a competent rider who prefers arena work or is nervous outside, or or or. If you have the time and money to do it now, do it or you might put something in the way of the best place for it. I am putting in a slightly smaller arena than I want because of this; if I had the money to have done it at the same time as my fence, I would have pushed my fence down another 20-30 feet, which isn’t that much really but would have enabled a larger arena.\n\nCertainly – although I just discovered that my favourite one doesn’t seem to be for sale anymore. I bought the one (20 LEDs) in my feed shed (8 x 10’) in 2016 for $30 & it is awesome – simple pull chain to turn on, plenty bright enough to make up feed or whatever, has been durable. It is similar to this: https://amzn.to/32BrvWu\n\nWhile not solar, I got this rechargeable magnetic light last year, which has been way better than expected. It is VERY bright, I use it for my x-tie area, but it also has 4 dim modes, I usually use it on the 3rd which makes the battery last longer. It’s waterproof. The only downside is that it has the worst button design ever, obviously made by someone who was sitting in a desk in a well-lit room (seriously, ppl, the reason we turn lights on is because IT’S DARK & WE CAN’T SEE ANYTHING). It was almost annoying enough initially to send it back, but then I fell in love with how bright it is & within a week, I got used to the dumb button & now it’s not a problem at all. It has an internal lithium battery that charges via USB, but I just bring it in the house once a week to charge. I leave it plugged in all day while I’m at work & the battery lasts all week (feeding, grooming, tacking, whatever, I have two horses). I would totally buy another one.\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2vjkde5"
