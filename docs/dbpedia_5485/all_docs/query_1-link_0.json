        "text": "In this part of the guide, you will analyze a series of short ASL texts to determine how ASL speakers use classifier constructs to convey meaning and as part of the grammatical feature of spatial structuring. You will also practice translating the ASL classifier constructs into equivalent spoken English words/phrases, and then integrate that information into an interpretation of the ASL message into spoken English.\n\nExercise A:\n\nConsider the following ASL text entitled A Cross Country Mishap. This ASL vlog is 1:03 minutes in length and the ASL narrator is discussing what happens to one individual during a cross country skiing competition. View the text first for comprehension, and then next to isolate and identify where classifiers and classifier constructs were utilized.\n\nA Cross County Mishap\n\nWhere did the narrator use classifiers in this text? What classification do the classifiers you identified fit into? How did the classifiers contribute to the spatial structuring of the message? How did the ASL narrator establish the topic, the individuals involved, and the specifics of what transpired in the story? What strategies did the narrator use to create a real-world orientation? Were there instances of close-up and long-shot perspective utilized? Record your findings.\n\nHow do your findings compare with the following list?\n\nPart of the application of these classifiers is the use of constructed action to depict one of the skiers falling behind, falling over a rock into a mud pond, getting up and leaving the incident moving in the direction of the other skiers. This alternating between close-up and long-shot orientation is a part of depiction in ASL. Depiction is another important aspect of incorporating a real-life, visual-spatial orientation to information and provides for a natural application of classifiers as part of the process.\n\nWith these examples in mind, along with any additional examples you identified, develop an English translation for each of the classifiers / classifier constructions. How would you articulate the information presented visually-spatially in ASL into an equally vivid and descriptive spoken English equivalent?\n\nOnce you have completed developing the translations of the individual pieces, practice incorporating them into an interpretation of the entire text from ASL to English. When you are comfortable with your interpretation, record it, share it with a mentor and/or peers for feedback, and re-do as the feedback warrants, until you have an ASL to English interpretation that you feel is a good illustration of the meaning of the text and incorporates the English wording that conveys the information in a dynamic and descriptive manner.\n\nYou can take the process one step further by having someone who is unfamiliar with the original text to back-translate the English interpretation into ASL and then compare that translation to the original text. This will help you to gauge how effective you were in preserving the semantic intent of the original ASL text.\n\nExercise B:\n\nYou will repeat the analysis process with additional ASL texts that you will translate into English. Here are the steps you will apply. A series of short but robust ASL texts are provided in Resources.\n\nStep 1. Analyze the ASL text to determine how classifiers were used as part of creating a real-world visual-spatial orientation.\n\nStep 2. Isolate and identify the classifiers and classifier constructs that exist within the text. What does each mean within the text? Identify the class of classifiers that were used - it is common to use multiple classes within a text.\n\nStep 3. How would the same information be communicated in spoken English? Complete a translation of each of the classifiers and classifier constructs from the text.\n\nStep 4. Now, generate an ASL to spoken English interpretation of the text in its entirety, giving particular attention to how you convey the ASL classifiers to create a dynamic equivalency in spoken English.\n\nStep 5. When you feel you have a fairly solid interpretation, record yourself generating it.\n\nStep 6. Conduct a self-assessment. Were you successful in applying the translations you intended? What would you do differently to make it more effective? Share the recording with a mentor and/or peers for further feedback.\n\nStep 7. Incorporating your own self-assessment and feedback from your mentor and/or peers, re-do your translation and filming of it.\n\nStep 8. If time permits, give the final English interpretation [audio only] to a peer unfamiliar with the text and your translation and have them back-translate it into ASL. How representative is the back-translation of the original ASL text? How might you improve your interpretation further to make it more equivalent?\n\nRepeat this process with any of the ASL texts found in Resources. With regular practice, review, and revision, this strategy will strengthen your ability to recognize and identify ASL classifier constructs in application and determine their English equivalence.\n\nExercise C:\n\nReceptive Recognition of Classifiers\n\nSelect ASL texts that incorporate a high use of classifiers.\n\nWatch the text and every time a classifier is used, stop the tape and reproduce/ shadow the production of the classifiers.\n\nThen, make a list of English words that indicate what the classifier represents. Practice stating the classifier information in a concise and descriptive manner in English.\n\nOnce you have identified and practiced all the classifiers in isolation, repeat the viewing of the text and state an English equivalent for the classifier information as each classifier arises in the text. State English words ONLY for the classifier information.\n\nThe third time through the text, integrate your interpretation of the classifier information with the rest of the text.\n\nRepeat this step as often as necessary until you are comfortable integrating the classifier information in concise and descriptive English.\n\nIf possible, record yourself interpreting the text, and ask someone to listen to the quality of your descriptions and provide you with feedback.\n\nRe-do based on the feedback.\n\nExercise D:\n\nMaintain a journal of ASL classifiers that you observe occurring in ASL narratives and conversations, as part of your interactions with the Deaf Community. Practice choosing English representations for the entries and discussing them with a colleague to expand the possible options you could use.\n\nIn this part of the guide, you will analyze a series of short English texts to determine how you can use classifier constructs to better convey spatial structuring as part of translating messages from English into ASL.\n\nExercise A:\n\nConsider the following English text, taken from The Random House Book of 1001 Questions and Answers, by Bridget and Neil Ardley, 1989, Random House, NY.\n\nQ: Why count calories?\n\nA: If you are watching your weight, you probably worry about calories…the number of calories you eat, or drink for that matter. Well, one thing you might consider when choosing drinks is that twelve ounces of beer has more calories than twelve ounces of soda. However, I doubt either one will help your diet!!\n\nWhere are opportunities to use classifiers in this text?\n\nThe topic of this text is counting calories. ASL typically follows a topic-comment structure. So, what is the core comment or point[s] about calories made in this text and what classifiers might be used to convey those points? The starting place is to think about this text in terms of a real-world orientation. For example, how is it that we as consumers know how many calories there are in a product? What does our process of worrying about or counting calories “look like” in the real-world?\n\nPerhaps we are checking out the label on a product to find out the calories - comparing product against product to determine which has the least calories, salt or other ingredients. Or, maybe we are using some calorie-calculating app on our iPhone or computer to do the same thing. With this in mind, what classifiers might be used? How do we go about ‘choosing drinks’? We might do it in a grocery store when we are buying our groceries or check out the app when ordering from a menu. And, why do we count calories? Because monitoring our weight is an important part of healthy living.\n\nSo, here are some places we might use classifiers in translating this text.\n\nInstrument CL:C handshape could be used to show us holding a can off a shelf in a grocery store. We could elaborate on this by holding cans in each hand for comparison, or by picking up one can, reading the label, putting it back on the shelf, picking up another can/different brand, etc. We could identify one can as beer and one as soda.\n\nDescriptive CL:G handshape could be used to show the front section that has the brand logo/name and number of ounces of liquid, then turn the can to the back to check the label on the can with the calorie information.\n\nDescriptive CL:open-B handshape to show changing size of a torso to indicate fluctuating weight and/or the desire to keep the torso lean/slim for the section on watching weight.\n\nPart of the application of these classifiers is the use of constructed action to depict a person/self hypothetically engaged in shopping and comparing labels. Depiction is another important aspect of incorporating a real-life, visual-spatial orientation to information and provides for a natural application of classifiers as part of the process.\n\nWith these possibilities in mind, develop a translation of the text, practice it, tape it, share it with a mentor and/or peers for feedback, and re-do as the feedback warrants, until you have a translation that you feel is a good illustration of the meaning of the text and incorporates several different classifier constructs that convey the information in a visual-spatial manner.\n\nYou can take the process one step further by having someone who is unfamiliar with the original text to back-translate the text into English and then compare that translation to the original text. This will help you to gauge how effective you were in preserving the semantic intent of the text.\n\nExercise B:\n\nYou will repeat the analysis process with additional English texts that you will translate into ASL. Here are the steps you will apply as you work with an English texts. A series of short but robust English texts are provided in Resources.\n\nStep 1. Analyze the text to determine how to approach the translation of the text using a real-world visual-spatial orientation. For example, if the text focuses on the location and description of something, is the size and shape something that will require you to alternate from close-up [like a rain gauge] to long-shot orientation [like the planets or the Grand Canyon], or will it require one perspective only?\n\nStep 2. Determine where there are opportunities to use classifier constructs. If you have multiple options for a certain portion of the message, consider which seems more natural and authentic in terms of a real-world orientation. Identify the class of classifiers that you will use - it is common to use multiple classes within a text.\n\nStep 3. Will the use of the classifiers involve the use of construction action or other elements of depiction? If so, where and how do you see it being incorporated?\n\nStep 4. Complete a translation of the text in its entirety, giving particular attention to your use of classifiers as part of your spatial structuring.\n\nStep 5. When you feel you have a fairly solid translation, record yourself generating it into ASL.\n\nStep 6. Conduct a self-assessment. Were you successful in applying the classifier constructions you intended? What would you do differently to make it more effective? Share the recording with a mentor and/or peers for further feedback.\n\nStep 7. Incorporating your own self-assessment and feedback from your mentor and/or peers, re-do your translation and filming of it.\n\nStep 8. If time permits, give the final translation in ASL to a peer unfamiliar with the text and your translation and have them back-translate it into English. How representative is the back-translation of the original English text? How might you improve your translation further to make it more equivalent?\n\nRepeat this process with other texts, more are provided in Resources. With regular practice, review, and revision, this strategy will strengthen your ability to visualize English texts in a more visual-spatial manner.\n\nExercise C:\n\nExpressive Use of Classifiers\n\nSelect English texts that are descriptive in nature - layouts of a house, descriptions of types of equipment or machinery and how they operate, geographic / scenic locations, physical appearances of people, animals, buildings, locations, etc.\n\nIsolate the items that would require the use of a classifier in ASL.\n\nMake a list and practice describing each of the items on the list.\n\nWork with the items in isolation for as long as needed, until you feel confident that you can effectively discuss the items by using signs and classifiers. If needed, discuss items on the list with a Deaf mentor or a colleague, asking for suggestions and ideas.\n\nOnce you have identified and practiced how to sign each item on the list, generate the items in context by re-telling the English text in ASL.\n\nIf possible, record yourself signing the re-telling of the text and ask a colleague or Deaf mentor to review the product and give you feedback on the effectiveness of the classifiers.\n\nRe-do the re-telling of the text on the basis of feedback.\n\nExercise D:\n\nMaintain a journal of English items that emerge as part of your daily work that you need to express in ASL by way of classifiers. Review your entries with a Deaf mentor or colleague to identify additional ways in which you could express the information."
