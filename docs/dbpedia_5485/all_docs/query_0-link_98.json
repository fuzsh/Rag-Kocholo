        "text": "I recently acquired an Intes 6” Rumak Maksutov Cassegrain telescope, seduced by rumours of their famed optical quality. The Rumak-Mak differs from the more familiar Gregory-Mak (such as Skywatcher’s) by having a separated and adjustable secondary mirror attached to the front correcting lens, rather than a Gregory’s non-adjustable mirrored spot. This allows more degrees of freedom for the optical designer, and the possibility of correcting a wider range of aberrations.\n\nThe scope was clearly quite old, but in reasonable shape, in particular the primary mirror and corrector plate which both looked immaculate. It came with a steel screw-on baffled dew shield, somewhat rusty on the inside, which must have been sat on at some stage of its life: it was bent into an oval at the open end. Leaning on it again and a bit of micro-surgery with pliers sorted it out.\n\nAll the visible screws on the scope were such as would not be used today, a combination of soft worn slot-headed screws and part-rounded-out Philips-heads. Most of the screw-heads in fact, both for collimating and holding things together, had signs of lots of use and wear. I was worried I wouldn’t get enough purchase on some of them if they proved stiff.\n\nThe focuser comprised a knob on the scope’s back plate, in common with all other SCTs and Maks I’ve seen. However, in use it was horrible: lots of slack, wobbly and clunky.\n\nA couple of sessions looking through the scope confirmed that I was going to have to collimate it, even though I did manage to see Mercury’s 50% phase one evening in Feb 2020 through a mask of trees. A Rumak’s adjustable secondary AND primary meant that collimating a scope like this was going to be not dissimilar to collimating a Ritchey-Chretien: difficult, but rather important for best performance. Perfect, because I love technical challenges like this. This scope had obviously had some fairly heavyweight “collimation” done to it in the past, to judge by the worn state of its collimation screws!\n\nTo collimate either mirror using the six screws for each meant I would need to know exactly how it was put together and what each screw actually did. Were they “adjust-and-lock” or “push-pull”? The only sure way to find out was to take things apart and have a look.\n\nThe combination of all fixings being tarnished and worn, a focuser in desperate need of servicing and my need to find out how the collimation adjustments worked, meant only one thing: Complete Tear-Down. Genuine Yipee.\n\nTear Down\n\nInterestingly, the other thread on CN describing an M603 disassembly, https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/580999-intes-micro-alter-m603-dissection/ , shows that our two scopes, despite having the same designation (Intes M603) have some quite big differences, especially in the focus-knob area! I think mine is significantly older. I couldn’t find any date-marks anywhere when I took it apart, but the rear of the primary mirror did have a hand-written “No. 117”. Hopefully between these two threads, all bases can be covered!\n\nMy strategy was:\n\n-Take everything to bits\n\n-Replace all screws, grubs and bolts with new stainless-steel torx or hex fittings\n\n-Clean and re-lubricate everything\n\n-Reassemble\n\n-Re-Collimate\n\nInformal Description with Pictures\n\nThe following steps and pictures paint an informal picture-guide to the tear-down. Later on I’ve assimilated this into a series of more detailed formal steps which will be useful in reverse when it comes to re-assembly.\n\nThe rear plate was removed from the main tube by unscrewing six slot-headed M4 countersunk screws, all of which moved and came away easily. This revealed a double baffle-tube, a large toothed ring and the primary mirror, all sticking up from the centre of the main rear plate.\n\nThe inner baffle tube, the longer of the two, was screwed directly into the external flanged “back” at the rear of the scope, which was in turn attached to the actual main rear plate of the scope via three pairs of heavy-duty collimating screws. Fiddling with these six collimation screws therefore changed the orientation of the whole main baffle tube with respect to the main back plate: it was this mechanism that collimates the primary mirror. Some of these screws had obviously been heavily used with much torque!\n\nAround the outside of the inner baffle tube sat a shorter outer baffle tube, which had a raised flange 2-3 cms from the rear plate, on which sat the primary mirror. The large toothed ring beneath it allowed the outer baffle tube, and hence the primary mirror, to slide up and down the inner one, driven by the external knob and a little gear plus a threading mechanism.\n\nThe primary mirror was held onto its flange by two retaining rings sitting atop it, each held in place on the baffle tube by a tiny grubscrew. The retaining ring closest to the mirror had its own flange.\n\nThe size of the primary mirror can be seen in the picture of me holding a set of micrometer jaws set at 150mm: the scope is specified at 150mm, so the mirror is considerably oversized.\n\nRemoving the mirror revealed a ring of some sort of contamination around its central hole. It turned out this was greasy dust on top of the mirror, not under the coating thankfully.\n\nThe mirror off, and the focusing mechanism was revealed: crude but effective, assuming I could get rid of the wonkiness and tooth-slack.\n\nThe back half of the scope all came apart rather easily and intuitively. Good.\n\nAlmost everything, barring the mirror, now went into my Ultrasonic Cleaner. Those two whitish plastic brackets were almost black in parts when they went in!\n\nNext I removed the front bit from the main tube: the Corrector Plate assembly and Secondary Mirror holder. These six screws were worn-out Philips-head screws, and one was quite difficult to get moving. But the front plate came off easily enough.\n\nDisassembling the secondary mirror assembly proved ostensibly simpler but rather more risky. The front plate comprised six collimating (push-pull) screws, three cap-head and three grubs, and a central locating-pin. The three cap-head screws were completely loose, although the heads showed signs of wear! They were so loose I could undo them with my fingernail, and they were the “pull” screws, threaded directly into the secondary holder itself. The three smaller screws, grubscrews, were very tight and quite difficult to remove without damaging the slot-heads. I had to proceed very slowly and carefully. Once all were free, the front plate still wouldn’t slide off. I noticed there were three further tiny pointed grubscrews on the SIDE of the cylinder, holding it in place. Two came out perfectly easily. The third one, however, took ages. The slot-head was far from centred on the top of the grubscrew and I had to be VERY careful not to simply tear the thin part off with my precision screwdriver. But I got there eventually.\n\nI have to admit I baulked at removing the Corrector Plate (the big lens on the front) from the scope’s main front ring. It was not designed to be adjusted and looked perfectly good to me.\n\nThe secondary mirror, once removed, had some similar contamination around the edge to that of the primary, but again I ascertained it was on top of the coating not underneath, and hence easily removable. Also, the central locating-pin was rather rusty.\n\nThe mirrors and corrector plate went into protective custody, as shown, and the remaining parts now reside in a cardboard box, awaiting my 50-odd miscellaneous new stainless screws, grubs and bolts from accu.co.uk.\n\nFormal Description, in Steps:\n\ni.Remove the 6 countersunk screws holding the main rear plate to the main tube;\n\nii.Notice the two retaining rings around the baffle tube sitting atop the primary mirror: they are each locked in place with a tiny grubscrew. Loosen these tiny grubscrews and lift the rings off the baffle tube (note that the one next to the mirror itself has a small flange – this sits adjacent to the mirror);\n\niii.Remove primary mirror and set it aside;\n\niv.Main rear plate central hub: unscrew and remove all 6 screws from the back plate (3 large, 3 smaller) – these screws hold the hub to the rear plate and also act as the collimation mechanism; Also notice and remove a single screw on the side of that hub, just next to one of the pairs of holes. This screw screws into the aluminium ring holding the plastic brackets, and effectively locks the non-moving part the baffle-tube focus mechanism;\n\nv.Unscrew the silver-metal “back” from the rear central external “hub” – take care, as this is what secures the whole baffle-tube assembly to the rear of the scope. Hold the baffle tube as you unscrew;\n\nvi.Remove and set aside the main rear plate, the black “hub” and the white-metal rear securing “back”;\n\nvii.The large toothed white-metal disc: the plastic brackets attached to this disc contain a coarse thread which meets a thread all around the outside of the black baffle tube. Unscrew the big disk all the way off the tube;\n\nviii.Dismantle the toothed focus-ring by unscrewing the 4 screws securing the whitish plastic brackets to it. The brackets will come away, together with the aluminium disc securing the white brackets. NOTE THE ORIENTATION OF THE SINGLE THREADED HOLE IN THAT ALU RING, IT’S OFF-CENTRE TOWARDS THE BACK END OF THE SCOPE.\n\nix.The inner and outer baffle tubes: notice a single screw, in the pic next to the number “19”. The screw attaches inside to a small brass sliding block which slides up and down a guide channel in the inner baffle, keeping the two tubes aligned as the outer mirror-holding tube slides up and down for focus. Be careful not to drop and lose the small brass notch when you separate the tubes!\n\nx.Front of scope: unscrew and remove the six countersunk screws attaching the front plate to the main OTA;\n\nxi.Secondary mirror: unscrew and remove all 6 collimation screws from the collimation plate, keeping the front plate upwards to avoid things dropping out;\n\nxii.With a long precision screwdriver, loosen the three tiny almost-invisible sideways-pointing grubscrews, which lock the secondary collimation-plate in place. Be careful not to touch the corrector plate while doing this.\n\nxiii.Lift out the front plate, to reveal the back of the secondary mirror itself;\n\nxiv.Carefully remove the secondary mirror, and escort into protective custody;\n\nxv.The End.\n\nRe-Assembly and Collimation\n\nWatch this space…\n\nEdited February 26, 2020 by Captain Magenta\n\nThe Start of Re-Assembly and Re-Collimation\n\nThis last weekend, and in possession of new pristine nuts, screws and grubs to replace most of the existing fixings, I set about re-assembly and the start of re-collimation.\n\nI smothered the meeting-faces of the two baffle-tubes in silicone grease, having been careful to make sure the brass tab was back in its place, and brought them together. Next I greased and assembled the large white-metal toothed sprocket assembly, the two white plastic brackets and the aluminium ring.\n\nThe idea was that the threaded end of the baffle-tube screwed into the two half-threads of the plastic brackets, but it proved rather difficult. I tried several times but it just didn’t want to go in square, it wanted to thread itself at an angle, and I was afraid if I tried too hard I’d damage the plastic threads. I had to think of another way. In the end, I had to re-dismantle the toothed-ring-and-plastic-brackets assembly, and start again by separately placing each plastic bracket directly onto the metal threads on the baffle-tube, made easier by the presence of lots of grease effectively sticking them in place, and then attach the metal ring and toothed gear-wheel in situ. That worked.\n\nNext I attached the black-painted metal rear “hub” to the full back-plate of the scope via my new “pull” collimation screws, and also screwed in the new (nylon-tipped no less) “push” grubscrews. I could then insert the back end of the focuser/baffle-tube assembly into the hub’s recess, partly locking its orientation with a single screw through the side which threaded into a hole in the aforementioned aluminium ring. I clamped the whole thing in place by threading on the white-metal SCT “visual back” from the other side of the back-plate, with a pair of extra pointed grubscrews to lock its position and prevent it from unscrewing while using it as a visual back.\n\nI also re-fitted the focus-knob assembly, comprising an inner thick brass round slug and outer plate, each with 3 holes, which when clamped together from either side of the back-plate allowed the brass slug’s central hole to receive the focus-knob axle, itself attached to and held in place by a small gear-wheel on the inside. The small sprocket’s teeth meshed with the teeth on the huge ring inside, and via the threaded white plastic threads the outer baffle-tube was allowed to slide up and down the inner baffle-tube. Since the primary mirror sits on a flange on the outer baffle-tube, focus is thus achieved.\n\nHowever, the hole in the brass slug is not quite in the centre, it’s slightly offset, so by adjusting the rotational position of the brass slug, the small sprocket can be adjusted closer to or further from the big wheel, allowing the teeth to mesh more or less closely. Crude, and a bit trial-and-error to get the right position, but it works.\n\nNow it was time to turn my attention to the primary mirror itself, and to start the 3 main steps of collimation (align focus-tube axis to centre of curvature of primary, collimate primary, collimate secondary).\n\nThe mirror was reasonably clean, except a ring of greasy dust right around its central hole. I cleaned this away. The primary mirror sits on a flange machined into the outer baffle-tube. Never a good idea to allow direct glass-on-metal contact, there were 3 thin strips of plastic tape going from under the mirror, up the inside of the central hole, and over the top onto the mirror itself. This ensured that the mirror was sitting on plastic tape on the flange, that the metal retaining ring on top was touching tape, not mirror, and that the sides of the 50mm hole in the primary were not directly touching the metal of the baffle-tube.\n\nUnfortunately, when I lowered the mirror over the tube and onto its flange, I noted that there was more “play” side to side than I was happy with. There must be some play, to avoid straining the mirror, but it must be infinitesimal. In the end, I applied two extra strips of electrical tape (0.1mm thick) at three places on the mirror around the inside of the central hole. Finally, I secured the mirror vertically with its two locking rings: the first simply rested on top of the mirror (again, infinitesimal gap) and “grub-screwed” onto the tube, the second threaded down onto that.\n\nCollimation First Stage: Aligning the Focus-Tube Axis Towards the Mirror’s Centre of Curvature.\n\nFollowing the logic in kitchen table collimation about the preliminary step for scopes with adjustable secondary AND primary, I constructed a makeshift optical-bench setup: A pair of axle-stands each topped with plastic V-pieces; and a “bullseye” target with a 1mm hole in the exact centre with a very bright light source just behind the hole.\n\nThe idea is to place the target in front of the primary mirror, which reflects the central light source back onto the target. If things are arranged such that the reflected dot returns exactly back to the light source, the target centre is at the exact centre-of curvature of the mirror. If that mirror is a spherical one, which in this case is likely, then the source-dot and its reflection represent the centre of that sphere. It’s very important that the focuser axis also coincides with that centre of curvature. A laser is used, inserted into the eyepiece-holder at the back of the scope, to check whether the laser spot also hits the sphere-centre. Neddless to say, the laser itself must properly collimated otherwise it’s a waste of time. In my case I was using a 2” Glatter, which I have tested to be properly collimated. If lucky, the laser dot will strike right on the centre of the target/light source.\n\nI wasn’t lucky. In fact Rus Slater, author of the website I’ve been using as a guide, writes:\n\n“Chances are that the laser spot will appear several millimetres off-centre. It now remains to find the source of the error and if possible correct it, noting of course that as already stated the focuser tilt is not independently adjustable on the smaller RC telescopes. Check firstly that the primary mirror is not loose;”\n\nThe photo here shows the light source and its reflection exactly on top of each other, but the laser dot 5mm “off”, which seems quite a lot. The radius of my spherical mirror being 800mm, the error amounted to over 21 arc-minutes. I did a bit of testing to see whether anything was loose: all was tight. I rotated the laser in its housing: no change. I rotated the whole scope on my “optical bench”, and the laser dot went around with it. There was no perceptible play in the placement of the mirror itself on its flange.\n\nI didn’t have time fully to investigate the source of the misalignment, that was for the following weekend, but things to explore further would include:\n\n-Play between the inner and outer baffle tubes\n\n-Misalignment of the SCT-2” adapter I’d attached to the Visual Back\n\n-Non-parallel rear surface of the primary mirror\n\n-Insufficiently-constrained mirror, causing it to “flop”\n\n-Misaligned mirror-support flange\n\nThis was the first really interesting part of this whole exercise: an actual optical problem to fix! Brilliant.\n\nIf it was to come to adjusting the tilt of the mirror on its flange, as seemed likely, the solution would be shimming between the mirror and its base-flange, as in this scope there was no other “designed-in” way of adjusting it. An adjustment of 21 arc-minutes across the 40-50mm of the central hole would amount to a shim of 0.25mm or so, in other words two layers of my electrical tape.\n\nUntil next weekend...\n\nEdited February 26, 2020 by Captain Magenta"
