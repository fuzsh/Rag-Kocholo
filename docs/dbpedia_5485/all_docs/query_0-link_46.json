        "text": "FAQs\n\nHow is my resolution determined?: Resolution is based on the number of pixels (wide or high) your image file is in relation to how large the image is printed. For instance, this image is pixels wide but is currently set at inches wide. By dividing pixels/inches your image resolution is approximately pixels per inch (PPI).\n\nWhy is my image cropped? : If the aspect of your image is different from the size to be printed, it may appear cropped which means not all the image is showing. If that is the case, the cropped portions will not be printed. You may be able to click and drag the image to reposition so certain subject matter is printed or try double clicking and zooming your image out. Otherwise you may want to select a size (if available) that better matches your image's aspect ratio.\n\nWhy is a small part of the image edges not visible? : If some of the image is not visible on the very edges, it is likely you ordered a print product which requires a small amount of bleed. This will be the case in which the printed image goes all the way to the edge of the product as seen with some cards and borderless prints."
