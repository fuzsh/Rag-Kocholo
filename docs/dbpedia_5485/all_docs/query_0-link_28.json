        "text": "DAVID ZIERLER: OK, this is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is June 29th, 2020. It is my great pleasure and honor to be here with Professor Carver Mead. Carver, thank you so much for being with me today.\n\nCARVER MEAD: Good to be here, David.\n\nZIERLER: OK, so to start, would you please tell me your title and institutional affiliation?\n\nMEAD: I'm the Gordon and Betty Moore Professor Emeritus at California Institute of Technology.\n\nZIERLER: OK. And when did you go Emeritus?\n\nMEAD: I think it was '97, but I could be off a year because I took a year off—I had never had a sabbatical in my 40 years teaching at Caltech. So before I retired I told our division chair, \"Look, I need to think about this. What do I want to do next? And I've never had a sabbatical before.\" So I took that year to work on my little green book, and by the time I was getting close to finished with that I could see that I would be better if I were Emeritus.\n\nZIERLER: But of course, Emeritus did not mean that you cut ties with Caltech. You've been hard at work ever since.\n\nMEAD: Yes, I always tell people that, when you're [laugh] Emeritus faculty you have all the privileges and none of the responsibilities.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: But you're a regular faculty, it's the other way around [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: Right [laugh]. So life is pretty good [laugh]?\n\nMEAD: Life is good and I still have a program there. I even have a grant there that is really to support my colleague—but it's for the little nitty gritty overhead stuff.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: I always tell people that what I do now is I work on what I want to work on, and what I think is important, instead of what somebody else thinks is important.\n\nZIERLER: That's right.\n\nMEAD: And so, actually it's been the most productive time in my life.\n\nZIERLER: That's wonderful. That's wonderful. Well—\n\nMEAD: Continues to be.\n\nZIERLER: —Carver, let's take it all the way back to the beginning. Let's start with your parents. Tell me a little bit about your parents starting with where they are from. Where's your mom and dad from?\n\nMEAD: Well, they're both Californians and so, I'm a fifth generation Californian. And my dad ended up in Redlands, California. His father had been a drifter and drifted from Missouri, I think, across the country. He had a little job here, a little job there, dragging the family along. My dad went to more different schools than he was years old.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And they ended up in Redlands and what my grandfather did was to—well, there were a lot of orchards in Redlands, citrus primarily. And they were owned by people from St. Louis and Chicago and Points East as a place to get away during the winter. So there were all these wealthy families that had a place to come and enjoy the winter in California and the orchard was what made it a business trip. But, of course, the orchards needed to be tended, so my grandfather had this little business of tending people's orchards and making them work, and he got a nice living out of that. So my dad grew up with a plow and some mules—-tilling the fields and doing that kind of stuff. And he actually got through high school. He was born in '04 and so, in those days, not everybody even got through high school. So he got through high school and then got a job working at the local drug company doing deliveries, because in those days drug stores delivered stuff to you just like they're starting to do now [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: Right [laugh].\n\nMEAD: And so, he was a delivery boy and then he read in the paper that there was this power company up northeast of Redlands in a little area where a stream called Mill Creek came out of the mountains there, which gives you a hint that it had been used for water power before. And they had built an electrical power plant there. One of the historic plants in the United States. Actually, it was the first three-phase plant in full commercial operation, so it was making electrical history. But they needed operators. This brand-new business was growing. Every time they had electrical power; people wanted it! The big customer was an ice plant in Redlands that made ice cheaper than you could make it in Los Angeles, because ice is all about refrigeration, which is about power. And they could use the local electrical power and make ice and then put it in to cool the railroad cars and ship oranges back East, where the market for fresh fruit was veracious in the wintertime. And so there were these opportunities. My dad went and somehow get a hold of some books and studied up on electrical stuff just on his own and got to where he could kind of grok it a little bit. And he went and interviewed, and he got a job as an operator in that new power plant. And so, that was how he got started in the electrical power business which was leading edge stuff then.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: The first power plant on that stream there was built in 1893. The power plant he worked in was built in 1896 and then was re-powered in 1904. That was the growth era in electrical power, local to Southern California. And so, he got the job and kept learning about hydroelectric machinery, and there was a better job that opened up in the same company, (Southern California Edison). They had a plant up on the Kern River which is east of Bakersfield, California quite a bit further north. So, he went up there and took that job and met a girl at one of the local dances. And so, that's where I came from.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: [laugh] And then when I was two years old he got a better offer at a place called Big Creek, which is halfway between Yosemite and Kings Canyon in Sierra Country east of the town of Fresno. And so, that's what I remember. I have only the vaguest memory of the Kern River. I was two years old when we moved away. I have, of course, vivid memories of the Big Creek Plant. And in those days when a plant was back in the mountains like that—we were two-and-a-half-hour drive to get to Fresno on these very crooked mountain roads.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: So we went to town once a month and bought the necessary things to get us through the month. Locally, the company had a commissary that would deliver once or twice a week to the plants. There were, I want to say, five power plants at various elevations down the drop of the water coming out of the high country, and each plant had the power plant itself and then they had a group of what they called cottages. Each plant had 14 of them—-that's what it takes if you have two people on shift, a station-chief and an assistant chief, and utility man and they're families. And then halfway between our plant, with its little group of cottages, and the next one upstream was our school. It was a one room schoolhouse, that had about 15 or maybe 20 total students it in it for eight grades. So there were a couple of students per class on average. It was a great experience because we got to listen in on what the kids in higher grades were learning, and that was much more interesting than the stuff that we were learning in first and second grade. And then, if you got stuck, one of the older kids would help you out, and it was like a bigger family. I was an only child, so I loved going to school because there was a social life there.\n\nZIERLER: Right—\n\nMEAD: Understand?\n\nZIERLER: —right.\n\nMEAD: So that's something people in education don't understand. The educational power of a social group like that where it was all ages and enough structure around it so the learning propagates up and down because the older ones get the experience of teaching younger ones and the younger ones get the experience of learning not just from a teacher but from the older kids. You know, you always respect the bigger kids. And so, it's a wonderful social environment for learning especially, in K-12. I think it's understood by people that do home schooling, because a lot of them do it communally, and that's a very effective way to have the kids exposed to other people and learn from different people in different ways.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: I think, from my own experience growing up in this little one room school house, the fact that there's more of that nowadays is very healthy. Today I would be put in a special class because I had ADD, and I was always listening in on what the older kids were learning. But it was a wonderful way to not constrict a person's learning, but allow them to tune into things that they found interesting. And so, I think it's much richer than a one classroom per grade arrangement.\n\nZIERLER: Carver—\n\nMEAD: Take it—\n\nZIERLER: —I want to ask with different opportunities and circumstances, do you think your father would have pursued an advanced degree in electricity?\n\nMEAD: They didn't know what that was.\n\nZIERLER: Uh-huh.\n\nMEAD: I mean the advanced degree part. He knew what electricity was.\n\nZIERLER: Yes.\n\nMEAD: But he didn't know about advanced degrees. I went all eight years in this one room schoolhouse. About halfway through, when I went in to the 6th grade, they put a big divider down the middle of the room and it became a two room schoolhouse, and we had two teachers. That was also a good experience for me because the teacher I got for the more advanced grades was a very wise man who was nearing retirement, and he was teaching because it seemed like a neat thing to do. And he became like an older relative to me, like a grandfather or something. And, for instance, one day I was working away and he said, \"Here, you might be interested in this.\" And it was a little book on trigonometry (I was probably 6th grade) and I was fascinated by that. That wouldn't have happened with just any teacher, so I was blessed with it. And his wife was a full-blooded American Indian, and she loved to go out in the woods and so, on weekends we would go off in the woods and go fishing together and exploring, because she just loved to get out. And I was somebody she could go around in the woods with, so [laugh] those are personal things that wouldn't happen with a big school… But then, when I graduated from the 8th grade, the high school we had was halfway down to Fresno. And so, it was like an hour away by bus, and it was a rudimentary high school. And my father quite properly saw that there were better options for my education. My grandmother lived in Fresno and she was a really neat lady, very smart lady, and her husband was getting older and her kids had moved away. My mother, of course, was her daughter, and her son had gone off to Europe during the war. And then he moved back to Fresno. But her husband was failing, so she agreed to take me in as a boarder in her place. It was a short bike ride to the local high school which had a lot more to offer. And so, I was one of very few kids from up in the woods that moved away to go to high school, which was great because her husband was not able to help very much. I ended up being the man around the house and I would fix things when they went wrong. And do stuff around the yard and do other things that normally he would be doing. I got to be very close with my grandmother. And I had the freedom, not only to go to this high school where they had—for example, by then I was very much into radio. We can talk more about that sometime. But it fascinated me, and there was a teacher in that high school that had a room where he taught electronics. What we call electronics now. It was radio then. And that would never have happened in the little rudimentary high school. Also there were the radio repair shops around Fresno where I got part time jobs and there were several radio stations. I studied up while I was in high school, studied up on everything I could get my hands on. Got my Ham Radio License and then I realized that these licenses weren't hard to get good grades on [laugh] and so, I studied upon the commercial license. There were two grades of commercial licenses. The first one allowed you to work on two-way radios, so that got me jobs at the little shops that maintained the two-way radios. And then the next one made you qualified to work as a Transmitter Engineer in a radio station. So, for my last two years of high school, I got a part-time job during the year. I was working the odd shifts on weekends. Nobody wanted to work on Sunday and all that. And then during the summers I worked vacation relief. So I had as much work as I needed and I was really well paid [laugh]. So those were just opportunities that never would have come up back in the woods. So my dad really had wonderful judgement about where I should go to High School. But he thought I should go to college there at the local state college and become a dentist, because our dentist was the highest paid guy he knew!\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: He thought I should be one of those too. So he didn't have a clue about what advanced degrees were. He knew I should go to college. They always said that, \"You got to go to college.\" But they didn't know what that meant really.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, did you—was your sense that your interest in radios and electricity and things like that—did you—was your sense that that specifically came from your father or do you feel like these interests you more or less developed on your own?\n\nMEAD: Oh, no. He was great about that.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: And every year he would take me down to the power plant. We'd go down and start at the bottom floor at the turbines and then work our way up to where the high-tension lines went out onto the grid. And he'd explain to me all the stuff. And, of course, to him he did the same thing every year, but to me I was a year older and I had a whole bunch more questions. And I learned a bunch more every year. And so, I would hound him to take me to the power plant and in those days that was leading edge. All of the electronic stuff that happened during the war at the Rad Lab and places like that—\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: —hadn't rippled through into a place like Fresno. And so, the power plant was leading edge and what little radio I could glean from—we had one guy who really got me into it. He moved into camp when I was just going into 7th grade. And his daughter was in the same class with me, so, of course, it was nice to go over to their place. And there he had this ham radio set up and he had two daughters, so I think he kind of wished he'd had a son that was interested in radio, so of took me in. I had been building crystal sets and stuff, but back in the mountains the crystal sets don't work really. So I'd have to take them to town and then see if they'd work when we visited my grandmother, and it wasn't a way to de-bug a system very well. But this guy really helped me get started and that was just as the World War II surplus started being available. And there was a place in Fresno that had lots of surplus stuff. So I could, you know, before I could get jobs doing electronic stuff I was cutting people's lawns and helping out with odd jobs and that kind of thing, and for a day's work I could buy an amazing pile of electronics [laugh]—\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: —on the surplus. So yes, my dad was the one that got me started in electricity and then it was this fellow that moved into camp who got me started in electronics. Not because I hadn't built little radios and stuff, but I hadn't met anybody around that I could really ask questions and figure things out. So by the time I got to high school I had already built things and made them work and so, that was a two-step process. My dad was very, very good at teaching me about electricity and how all that worked and then this other fellow, Mike Blaine, was the guy whose daughter I liked and who, you know, was always pleased to have me around. I think both he and his wife thought maybe the girl and I would get together, but then when I moved to Fresno that wasn't what happened. But otherwise I might have been their son-in-law. So yes, he was an essential part of my early feeling about electricity. It was never mysterious. You know, a lot of people think electricity's mysterious. It's not mysterious. It just works and it works like this. That's what happens when you start out from two years old being told about the power plant and how it works.\n\nZIERLER: Carver—\n\nMEAD: So—\n\nZIERLER: —how were you as a student? Were—did you get good grades in math and science in high school?\n\nMEAD: Yes, I did, but largely because we had really good teachers.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: There was a little lady that taught us Algebra and she was just dynamite. She just really knew it! The other kids didn't like her because she was very strict and very demanding. But I loved her because she really knew what she was talking about. And I had a wonderful guy who taught chemistry and physics. He was actually the tennis coach, but a great guy. And these people were always around. I could go over to his house if I had something special, I want to talk about. I was welcomed there and that's very unusual for a public high school. And we had this fellow who taught the electronics stuff and of course, I loved that. But I found the math very interesting. Not because of the math, but because it represented physical things. So the teachers I had could say now, this technique is useful when you have a problem like this and it was a physical problem. And so, I could see the mathematics being useful as a representation of physical reality. How would you figure out how much power it took to do this or how much—how would you figure what's the optimal diameter for a water tank to use the least steel to make it out of and for a certain volume of water? And that was what grabbed me about the mathematics. It wasn't as a subject in itself. It was as a technique for being able to figure out things about the real world. because I could see that the radio stuff—you had to know how to analyze it and I wanted to know how to analyze it and math was a useful thing. But I never was one of these math whizzes which just did it because it was a game. To me it was never a game. It was a tool, so I've never been popular with math teachers.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] Carver, tell me a little bit about your decision to go to Caltech. What other schools besides Caltech did you apply to?\n\nMEAD: Well, that's interesting. So by the time I was thinking about colleges my dad wanted me to go to Fresno State and be a dentist. But by then I was working at the radio station and I got to know some of the other Engineers there. You know, I would take their shift or I would come on shift right after them and they'd stay around and talk or, you know, I just got to know them. And there was one couple Randy Kyle and his wife who didn't have any kids, so they sort of took a liking to me and we'd have dinner together once in a while, and one day we were talking and he said, \"Well, where are you going to college?\" And I said, \"Well, my dad wants me to go to Fresno State.\" He said, \"How do you do on math?\" And I said, \"I do well.\" And then he said, \"Well, what you should do is you should go down to Caltech and major in Electrical Engineering.\" Well, A: I'd never heard of Caltech—\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: —and B: I didn't know that electrical engineering was a field. Never heard of it. We had one guy at the high school that was sort of a counselor, who would help you with getting ready for college, and he knew about Caltech. So he got me the place to write to get an application and a catalog. And then I knew about Stanford because a lot of the electronic stuff I had read was by Stanford professors—-they were very early on the West Coast –\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: and they did a lot of remarkable stuff. So I had heard about those two schools. I didn't want to go to the east coast because it was hard enough moving from the back woods to a big town like Fresno—\n\nZIERLER: Sure.\n\nMEAD: —but to move to a place in an environment which I had no familiarity would have been a big thing, to say nothing of the expense and all that. So my folks were real good about it. I applied to both schools and Caltech was real interesting: In those days they sent a full faculty member to interview every student in the United States that had applied and passed some minimum criterion. And we had a guy by the name of Jahns, who was a geology professor and he came up. And there were two of us that had applied that year and he interviewed us both and said, \"Well, you both look like admissions to me, so I'll make a favorable recommendation. It's not a done deal, but I'll recommend that you be admitted.\" Which was really nice that he'd just come out and say that [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: Because, of course, you're nervous. So I got admitted both places and my folks were willing to drive me up to the Bay Area and spend a day at Stanford and then drive me down to Pasadena (we were just halfway between). So we went to Stanford and went to their Undergraduate Office, I forget what they called it, and asked them if they had any tours or anything and they said, \"No, but here's a map of the campus.\" So we walked around. Really nice campus.\n\nZIERLER: Yes.\n\nMEAD: But I didn't get to see anybody, didn't get to talk to anybody, and all I learned was it's a really beautiful campus. And then we drove down to Pasadena and went to the Undergraduate Office and there was a lady there and we told her who we were. She said, \"Oh, you're a new admit. Well, we do have tours and they're given by the Y[MCA]. I don't have any scheduled today but let me see if I can round somebody up.\" And she called around a little and then said, \"There will be somebody here in an hour if you can come back.\" Well, Yes. So we went and got lunch I think and came back and this guy took us around and showed up various places. One of the interests I had as a high school—I had built my own six-inch telescope and made it work—because I'd always been interested in astronomy and there was—in addition to the local ham radio club there was an astronomy club. I would hang out with the guys and they let me look through their telescopes. So I wanted one of my own, so I built one. I couldn't afford to buy one, but I built one. Wasn't as good as theirs, but it worked. I ground the mirror and everything. I learned a lot with that. And so, when this guy was showing us around he said, \"This is the astronomy building.\" And I said, \"Well, I've read that on top of this building there's a one-tenth scale model of the Palomar Telescope.\" And he looked very surprised that I knew that. And I said, \"Is there a chance we could see that?\" And he said, \"Oh, well let's go ask.\" So we walked in and at the back of the first floor there was an office that said Astronomy, and we went in there. There was a lady there, and our guide said, \"These people are with a new admit and would like to see the telescope.\" And she said, \"Oh, here's the key. It's up on the roof level.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] Help yourself.\n\nMEAD: So then we went up there and here was this beautiful thing and it was a scale model of the real thing which is—you know, that was—I think for 40 years it was the biggest telescope in the world—and this was the model that they debugged all the design and everything on. It still worked and this guy had never seen it before. So I started explaining to him how it worked and this must be this and it works like this and so forth. And he was getting a kick out of this too because he had had a chance to see it. So we must have spent half an hour up there and it was really neat. And—neat not just because of the thing, but because these people were taking me seriously.\n\nZIERLER: Yes, Yes.\n\nMEAD: I mean I was being treated as a member of their community.\n\nZIERLER: And you felt that at the time. Not just looking back?\n\nMEAD: Felt that at the time, Yes. I mean it was palpable from the lady who called over to the Y, from the lady that gave us the key. They all treated me as if I was a member of that community. So we went down and he went in to give the key back and I just went in with him. And I looked at the lady and I said, \"Is there any chance if we drove down to Palomar that we could see the big one?\" And she looked at me and she said, \"Well, they don't give tours, but, you know, if you wanted to take a chance, you could go down there just about sunset and there'd probably be somebody inside that was setting up for the nights observation and if you banged on the door, they may or may not answer it, but you could take the chance.\"\n\nZIERLER: It was one of those moments that really changed everything for you?\n\nMEAD: Yes, so we did that, and we got there just as the sun was setting. I went up to the door and banged on the door and we waited. And there was no sign there was anybody in there —but we'd driven a long way and so, I went up and banged on the door again. And nobody answered and after about five minutes I thought I'll try one more time. So I went up and banged on the door even harder and then we waited a few minutes and were just about to leave and the door opened. And there was this big guy, big bright blue eyes, and he was—looked at me and he said, \"Yes?\" In a sort of \"what the hell are you doing?\" And I told him I had just been admitted to Caltech and got a chance to see the 20-inch scale model and I just wondered if we could just look at the big thing. And he looked at me a long time, and then he said, \"Sure, come in.\"\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: And that was Hubble's Research Assistant Alan Sandage.\n\nZIERLER: Okay.\n\nMEAD: We became friends after I got on the faculty. And he showed us the instrument and how it worked and wished me the best. And that's why I went to Caltech.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: Because I was treated like a person and not some lower form of life, and that worked all the way through my undergraduate time there. Some of the classes weren't that great and some of the teachers weren't that great, but I had Linus Pauling for freshman chemistry—-\n\nZIERLER: Wow.\n\nMEAD: —and he taught me quantum mechanics because he had just written his book: The Nature of the Chemical Bond.\n\nZIERLER: Uh-huh.\n\nMEAD: And It doesn't get better than that!\n\nZIERLER: Right [laugh.]\n\nMEAD: Because you get the real feeling for the subject. You know, it wasn't just some math that was being spewed out. There were just enough good teachers—I had Bonenbhlust for freshman math—-he was one of these people who taught math with examples from the physical world. So I could do well in it, but the next year I had a pure math type and I barely got through that class because there was no connection with anything physical.\n\nZIERLER: Too abstract?\n\nMEAD: Yes, Yes. That was before there was a notion of applied math.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: So the distinction hadn't dawned on people yet for some reason [laugh]. I had a hard time with those classes because they didn't connect with anything physical. But for instance, I think I was a sophomore and I got a job at the local—there was a local company called Consolidated Electrodynamics. And it was an outgrowth of Herb Hoover Jr's company that he had there in Pasadena for doing electronics for things like oil expiration where they were getting signals coming back from an array of geo-sensors and wanted to record them. They'd either put an explosive in the ground or they would have a big truck that had a big vibrator on it that would do a chirp. They made a recorder that would record simultaneous signals from 100 geo-sensors—-in those days there was no digital stuff. The signals were recorded on a 12-inch moving piece of film by light beams bouncing off little galvanometers, each with a mirror on it.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: They would write all these light beams on this piece of film and so, you'd have 100 light beams all crossing over each other. Somebody had to unwind all this.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: By today's standard it was just laughable. But they figured stuff out, and I got a job with them as a technician. I guess I did well enough that I got to be sort of an engineering helper at the transducer division. And the transducers were these little galvanometers—-it was the first time that I had to learn about electro-mechanical coupled system. And so I studied up on that. They had to have a magnet for the little coil in the galvanometer—-the magnet, that give it the bias field so the current in the coil would make a torque on it. By that time, I was a junior, and I had just taken the junior lab, which was very out of date. So I volunteered. I went to the Caltech EE people and said, \"If I get these guys to donate a galvanometer and a magnet to put it in, I will make an electro-mechanical system lab.\"\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: So it turned out they must have liked me well enough because Consolidated agreed to donate one of these to Caltech, and EE paid me for a summer to build the thing. I made a box with a ground glass scale on one end and the magnet block with one galvanometer in it, so the light beam from the galvanometer mirror would be visible on the ground-glass scale. And I used an ordinary audio oscillator to drive the galvanometer coil. The damping depended on the impedance of the source that was driving the coil, and by changing that you could get it to go above and below critical damping and you could figure all that stuff out. And I wrote up a nice little lab for the lab class and they paid me for the summer for that. So it was a continuation of being treated like a person instead of a number on something.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, did you find it hard to settle on one major? Did you want to just be in all of the departments in a sense?\n\nMEAD: I had liked physics until I went to their freshman physics class and their sophomore physics class and then the junior physics class was the first year they did quantum mechanics the way it's done now which is, you now, you have to learn all this matrix math, Most of which has very little to do with anything physical.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: And can only calculate probabilities and none of the intermediate stuff has any physical significance. So I got lost just like I did in sophomore math—-there was no physical connection between the math and the reality that you're trying to analyze. And so, I struggled like hell in that class and I said, \"I loved physics, but not the way it's being done.\" Here I was, a kid that had made a meaningful contribution to a lab that I understood! And they were trying to turn it into something that wasn't physics. So I had another really bad experience. I had been introduced to quantum mechanics by Linus Pauling. I knew what it was about, and this class had none, none, zero! So if that's what they do in physics, I want none of it!\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: I had had a job for two years as technician in physics. We had the synchrotron on campus, and they needed a RF transmitter basically. They would FM it to follow the beam as it sped up. In the synchrotron, you know, you squeeze it down and it goes faster and so, you have to get the RF that drives the plates in the accelerator to track the rate that the beams going around. And so I built a little transmitter that did that for them and—but the particles didn't mean anything to me and in EE they were doing good stuff. I mean I could make up experiments that understood, like the coupled mechanical-electrical systems, and that's real stuff. Not so trivial to understand. So when I declared a major I just declared EE because these physicists were nice guys and I made some really good friends over there, but the way they did things wasn't the way I did things, so OK, OK. And what I didn't realize is that I wanted applied physics, not what they call \"pure\" physics.\n\nZIERLER: —Did Caltech not have an applied physics program at that point?\n\nMEAD: No, Amnon Yariv and I started one in 1964.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: After I was on the faculty we both were annoyed with the Physics Department. Well, Murray Gell-Mann used to say, \"Oh, that's squalid state physics.\" [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: Right [laugh].\n\nMEAD: He was a very dominant kind of guy and he also didn't believe that anybody else's viewpoint was meaningful except his. And so he wouldn't allow any such thing in the Physics Department. But meanwhile, I knew I couldn't do it by myself and when Amnon got here we started working together and he said, \"Hey—this sucks. We've got to have a way to give degrees to people doing applied physics, not just this particle stuff which is a tiny fraction of the field.\"\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: —in the—what we would think of as applied physics now.\n\nZIERLER: So you really went to EE because there wasn't an applied physics program. That's what—where you wanted to do your applied physics was in Double E?\n\nMEAD: Well, it was—yes, yes. And I was lucky that we had two faculty—it was a tiny little department. I think it only had six faculty total.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And we had two guys that knew that the physics of the electrical stuff was important. Like, one of them was Joe Langmuir who was the nephew of Irving Langmuir and a really neat guy. And so, he—when he taught E&M, he taught what it was that made an inductor work the way it did. What did you do physically to make a thing that would have this property? And what the physics of what was inside there? So start with Maxwell's equations and figure out an inductor works. And there was another guy Charlie Wilts who did the same thing with electro-mechanical systems. That's where I learned it. So we had two guys in a department of six who actually could make the connection across from some more abstract representation of the physics to real things that had real electrical properties that used electrical circuits. It's a way of thinking that they don't have in physics. And I was just lucky that there were two guys that actually had that way of thinking. So I ended up doing my thesis when transistors were just new and I was fascinated by these things because I'd been working with vacuum tubes all my life.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: And transistors were interesting! We even had a guy on the faculty that taught about the physics of vacuum tubes. The first level of that is really neat because you can learn about temperature limited and space charge limited current and that's really neat. But then they wanted us to learn the physics of a round vacuum tube which had grid wires that were vertical and get some transform to put them in some coordinate system that you could analyze. Not Interesting! By then I had surplus World War II vacuum tubes that had parallel plates, so they were much more interesting than these things with, you know, glass and stuff. And they also had one-dimensional current flow. They were just like the idealization.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: So why should I [laugh] go through all this mathematical rubbish when it isn't the ideal thing anyway?\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: So I had trouble with those guys because they're not thinking about it right. Just get the right vacuum tubes so it is the ideal thing and then you can tell if it really works or not. So anyway—so I ended up in this in-between stuff. Dave Middlebrook had been at Stanford, learned transistor physics from the guys there. I think John Moll had moved out from Bell Labs to Stanford. If I'm right, I think he was the first Bell guy from that transistor group to get on the west coast. And so they were ahead of Caltech in the whole transistor thing. So Caltech hired Dave Middlebrook who, I think, was one of their first graduates there at Stanford to do this kind of stuff. Dave had written this little book called the Introduction of Junction Transistor Theory. He had a very simple explanation of the physics in one chapter there, but I found him to be really interesting and a neat guy. Good teacher. So I signed up with him.\n\nZIERLER: Take your time.\n\nMEAD: So I'll be right back.\n\nZIERLER: All right.\n\nMEAD: Hi, David.\n\nZIERLER: Hello.\n\nMEAD: So anyway, I was talking about Dave Middlebrook.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: And he was our transistor guy and he had done enough physics to have one chapter in his book on it, but he was really a circuits guy. And the circuits were interesting, but I got more and more into the fact that the transistors we could get weren't very good and they had a lot of limitations. The first year I was working with Dave we had some guys come up from a little company down by the Los Angeles Airport called Pacific Semiconductors, Inc. which of course had a Greek Psi for a logo [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] Right.\n\nMEAD: And nice enough guys. Of course, I had been reading voraciously all of Shockley's stuff and of the stuff out of Bell Labs because you just had to. They had published a bunch of stuff. In those days the literature was funny because we had people like John Moll and a guy by the name if Ebers at Stanford who had written his authoritative analysis of a transistor, so they wanted to make a little model of a transistor. And it turned out that they had made this small signal model of a transistor which was fine, but I knew that most transistors, even then, were not used for small signals [laugh]. The linear approximations were never very good – transistors had in them these junctions that were enormously more non-linear than vacuum tubes were. So you had to think about them differently even to use them for small signals. And if you're going to use them for large signals they had even bigger issues that you did not have with vacuum tubes. So they were a new thing and all of the vacuum tube stuff was only partly relevant and I knew this because I was voraciously reading all the stuff I could, because that was what I wanted to do somehow was transistors. And yes, circuits, but the circuit got limited by what the transistor was doing in plenty ways that I didn't understand. So these guys showed up from Pacific Semiconductors and we started talking and it turned out I had read a bunch of stuff that Dave had not read. So by the time we had lunch they offered me a consulting job as a first year grad student [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: Well, that was great because I already had two kids and I had to support them.\n\nZIERLER: Right.\n\nMEAD: And also I can learn something.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: So it turned out I was just lucky, like I had been at other times—-things work for me when I can relate to people in a creative way.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: And there was a guy there by the name of Jim Buie, and he was down to Earth—I think he had a Bachelor's Degree from somewhere. And he did experiments and he invented things and I loved to talk to him because he was very smart, and he had a physical way of thinking which I could relate to. So we got to be close collaborators—when I would go down there I would spend half of my time with their materials and fabrication people. They were making one -inch wafers of silicon and making junction transistors that would work at high powers and high frequencies. And they had the only ones that really worked, so, they could sell them to the military. They were right down by LA airport with a lot of other World War II defense people. And a lot of those were heavy in electronics, so—Pacific Semiconductors later on got bought up by TRW. And now it's a division of Northrop Grumman.\n\nZIERLER: Okay.\n\nMEAD: Northrop Grumman Space Technology it's called now. And they make all kinds of III-VI high frequency semiconductors. But back then they were leading edge on the high frequency Silicon transistor stuff. When I went consulting there I would go in and see Jim Buie because he always had interesting things—I learned a lot from Jim and I think he liked somebody to ask him questions and try to understand what he was saying because I don't think many people there understood what he was doing. And so, one day he said, \"Hey Carver, look at this.\" I looked through the microscope and there was a transistor-like thing that had five emitters on it and I said, \"Jim, what the heck is that?\" He said, \"That's a way of doing logic which you have more than one emitter, and any one of them will make current go out the other side.\" He had invented TTL, which was, for many years, the dominant logic family.\n\nZIERLER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMEAD: And that was the first notion I had of how you use physics to make logic. The guy that invented TTL taught me how transistors make logic [laugh]. I mean, it doesn't get better than that!\n\nZIERLER: That's right.\n\nMEAD: So I was learning from the guys who were doing it. And in those days the thing that always annoyed me about the EEs is that, except for a few of them, they would teach all this linear small signal stuff and nobody ever talked about what happens when it's nonlinear. Well, already a whole lot of circuits worked in switching mode, like switching power supplies and digital logic. And even then—this was in 1960-ish—that was a thing that was happening. I could see that this small-signal linear stuff was a tiny, tiny fraction of electronics. After all, how many audio amps you need to make? [laugh] And I had been very annoyed by this Ebers, Moll paper which had all these complicated modeling equations. Then a paper appeared, I think it was around 1960 or '61 by John Linvill, who was a prof up at Stanford—- I think he was a second-generation faculty there—roughly same generation as Middlebrook. And he had written this beautiful paper where he had the most beautiful insight. He said, \"Look, inside the transistor you have minority carriers and they work by drift and diffusion and those are linear in the density of minority carriers. And then you have the outside of the transistor where you have circuit elements which are linear. The only problem is you have these junctions in between which are exponential, so why don't we just say that?\" So he built this model which made a lumped approximation for the diffusion of minority carriers in the piece of Silicon or Geranium or whatever in the base region. Then there were two boxes which had the exponentials that converted the emitter-base voltage into the carrier density at the emitter and the collector-base voltage into the carrier density at the collector. And so, it was a two step process. Well, it was beautiful because it was straight physics, straight from the device. No bullshit about linearizing an exponential which is problematic, and I just fell in love with that. It was great because I can solve switching problems and there were no papers.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: One of the things that happened with either a diode or a transistor is you would forward bias a junction to turn the device on, and that would flood the base region with minority carriers, which made the base region a good conductor and you could switch a lot of current. And then you would reverse-bias the junction and it would still be a good conductor because of all the minority carriers that were stored there—-the density would get smaller, and smaller, and all of a sudden WHAM! It would turn off. And that was because minority carriers were in there, and until you got them out of there they were still carrying current. So I made a little model for that physics, and I measured power transistors that showed this minority carrier storage effect, and it all fit with John Linvill's lumped model, so I could actually get real equations that gave me the non-linear behavior of the transistor in switching mode. I figured this all out and John Linvill hadn't done it. We later became good friends. Wonderful guy! I was very pleased because I had figured this out and nobody else had figured it out. It was simple. So I wrote my thesis on this phenomenon, that was half physics, half electronics. What do you call it? Well, it later became device physics which became a field of its own. But in those days it was just trying to figure out how things worked and it was half electronics and half physics. So in terms of who I am and where I came from, that's the trajectory. You can probably see a theme running through that.\n\nZIERLER: Absolutely [laugh].\n\nMEAD: [laugh] I think if it's OK with you, we can stop there.\n\nZIERLER: Okay.\n\nMEAD: And do another one soon?\n\nZIERLER: Absolutely, Yes.\n\n[End of recording]\n\nBack to top\n\nDAVID ZIERLER: OK. This is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is July 5, 2020, and it's my great pleasure to be back with Professor Carver Mead of Caltech. Carver, thank you so much for joining me again.\n\nCARVER MEAD: Good to see you, David.\n\nZIERLER: OK, so let's pick up on where we were from last week. We talked about the defense of your thesis, and the origins of what would become known as device physics. So, my first question is, was that term bandied about at the time of your defense, or this would only come about later as more people got involved in combining EE and physics?\n\nMEAD: That's a good question. It's funny. I don't remember when the term came into use. I just don't remember. I don't think it was in common use when I was doing my thesis. I looked at the minority carrier storage problem with minority carrier devices. That problem is why they're not used anymore, or used very little.\n\nAnd I just looked at it as a problem that needed to be solved. Whether you thought of it as a circuit problem or a device problem, it was both, and it needed to be understood. And so I just did that. And it isn't obvious that that term was used at the time. It's an excellent question. I just haven't thought of it before.\n\nZIERLER: Maybe we can get at it this way. What—did you think of your thesis in your own sort of scholarly identity as multidisciplinary? Did you see your work as, you know, necessarily combining two distinct fields?\n\nMEAD: Yes, it was—here was a thing, an emerging class of electron devices that were obviously going to take over electronics and—\n\nZIERLER: And why obvious, Carver? Why was that obvious?\n\nMEAD: Just power. It was so clear that if you were going to build anything at scale, it was already known that the big computers were limited by the power to run the vacuum tubes. So it was just obvious to everyone that if you had a low-power, high-performance solid-state device, that would be the way electronics was done. Of course the devices we had in those days were pathetic, but they even then took over applications that they could get to with the performance they had.\n\nSo the performance of the device were limiting what was obviously the next wave of electronics. And that was obvious. It was certainly obvious to me, and I think obvious to everyone. Although I remember the [laugh] long story about my involvement with people at General Electric Company down in Owensboro, Kentucky, where they had a major facility. And they had developed a marvelous little vacuum tube that was about a quarter inch in diameter, and you could stack up in these quarter inch little tubes. The technology was called TIMM (Thermionic Integrated MicroModule. And it was a fantastically innovative technology.\n\nAnd what they did is—they would stack them up—they had little cylinders of aluminum oxide ceramic that were metalized on the two ends. And then they had a bunch of prefabricated little discs that they could put in between neighboring cylinders and stack up and make a sort of a log, a long cylinder out of it. And these little discs, they had one for anode, one for cathode, and one for grid. And they would stack them up. Each disk was round, and had a little tab that stuck out to the side. And they had I think 12 positions that it could stick out.\n\nAnd so they would make a stack, and the entire assembly was going to be like 10 centimeters long. And they would stack up these things. If they weren't connected, they'd leave a little space in between. But you could make things that had common elements. And if you wanted to connect elements that were not common, you made the tabs in the same orientation, and then they had a wire would connect all the disks whose tabs were in the same orientation. Then they put the whole thing in a vacuum oven, and run it up to a temperature where the metal that was on the ends of the little ceramic tube sections would melt and it would braze into the little discs and make a single unit out of the \"log\", and the whole thing then became an assembly of vacuum tubes. They could make diodes and triodes and connect them together this way. And then they would make a bunch of those logs, and stack them up, and then they had wires that ran to interconnect them from the ends. So it was an integrated circuit made of vacuum tubes. And they put it in a little thermal insulating box, and they had a little heater in there, and they'd heat it up to the point where the cathode started to emit electrons. And then current would start to flow in the circuits, and then the dissipation of the thing kept it at the right temperature.\n\nIt's an extraordinarily ingenious use of vacuum electronics. The little discs were made of I think titanium. But titanium if you heat it up in a vacuum like they did when they processed the thing, it was really hot because they'd melt the metals—not the titanium but the braze that they used to hold it all together. That also sealed it, of course.\n\nAnd at those temperatures, you get all the dissolved gases out of the titanium so then when it cools down, it's a wonderful getter. And at the temperature they'd run it, it was a good getter, so that the vacuum became extremely good inside. Fantastic technology! And I remember one of the GE guys telling me, he said, \"You know, these solid-state guys, they just don't know what they're up against, because we've got them going away.\" And it was true compared with individually packaged transistors. They were never going to get close to this vacuum technology. They were thinking individually packaged electron devices because that's all there had ever been. So if it weren't for the integrated circuit, we'd be making our computers out of thermionic integrated micromodules. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And they'd be working really well, and they would be orders of magnitude—probably two orders of magnitude better than what you could do with plug-in vacuum tubes of the day. So, they were right. If the integrated circuit had not been invented, that's the electronics we'd be working with.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about—you know, the technological limitations are very clear, you know, in terms of what you're discussing in the late 1950s and early 1960s. What were some of the theoretical limitations that you were coming up in this new interdisciplinary field that you were quickly rising in?\n\nMEAD: Oh, that's a good, good question. Of course, for me, it seemed as though the minority carriers were the problem, and my work for the thesis had been on the problems they caused and what the application issues were that came from those device problems. And so it was just clear that they would never be an ultimate solid-state technology. And so here I was having just written a thesis on why these things are a problem. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] Right.\n\nMEAD: —and how you analyze it, and how you quantify it, and so forth. And that same year I think, which would've been 1959.\n\nZIERLER: You defend in 1960, I believe.\n\nMEAD: '59, actually.\n\nZIERLER: '59, OK.\n\nMEAD: But I missed the parade—\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: —I nominally got my degree in 1960 but I defended in '59. So early, early '60s, they wanted somebody at Caltech that did what we now call device physics. And it was clear that Middlebrook did transistor circuits, and he had a passing acquaintance with device physics but that's not what he really did.\n\nAnd here was this kid that had certainly gone off on his own, and done this thesis on device physics, and those people are in short supply. So they asked me to stay on in the faculty. I had been teaching a course as an instructor for a couple of years anyway, so I was a likely suspect. They don't like to hire their own graduates. But I guess you do what you have to do, right?\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: But it was probably '60 or '61. I could pin it down for you, and I'll tell you how. We had a visitor to give a seminar, and his name was Leo Esaki. And he had invented this thing which we called an Esaki diode, but he called it a tunnel diode. And it used electron tunneling to make a negative resistance device that was very, very fast because there were no minority carriers.\n\nSo I went to his seminar, and it blew me away. OK, here's a way to make electron devices that don't have minority carriers, so that then became a quest for me. Yes, you need to make devices that don't have minority carriers because they're the root of all evil in terms of getting high performance in solid-state devices.\n\nZIERLER: And how do you define \"high performance\"?\n\nMEAD: Fast, and low power, you know, you can define it several ways. We'll get to that. But that seminar changed my life. And they tried to hire Leo Esaki. He was basically hunting for a job in the US, and they made him a faculty offer, and so did quite a number of other people. But he ended up at IBM, and got a Nobel Prize for that tunnel diode—-well-deserved.\n\nAnd later, we became friends, but weren't close collaborators or anything, but I would see him at meetings and stuff. And I'd give a talk once in a while at IBM—he was a smart guy. So I fell in love with the idea of electron tunneling because you didn't need the other kind of carrier, which was what limited everything about a minority carrier device. The Bell guys actually started out to make a majority carrier device, but I didn't know that. And I'll get to that part of the story later because it's a fun story.\n\nSo I was determined to—instead of a negative resistance two-terminal device—-to make a three-terminal device with electron tunneling as the mechanism. That's a good thing to do. And so I started making thin films—-just a metal substrate, evaporate a thin oxide on it, and then I put little dots of some other metal on it, and then tunnel electrons from the metal substrate, through the thin oxide, and into one of the metal dots, because I wanted to understand this tunneling stuff. And, you know, the first experiments were crude. But within a couple of years, I was able to get a lot of information and a lot of understanding about the tunneling.\n\nYou could make the thicknesses different (I used the capacitance to tell how thick the oxides were), and that made the tunneling probabilities different, and from that I could work out what the propagation vector was. The propagation vector of the electron gets to be imaginary in the insulator. And I could figure out what that imaginary part of the propagation vector of the electron was. So I was up to my ears in the quantum nature of electrons, and how they behaved in these forbidden gaps where they're not supposed to be. So, anyway, within a year or so, I had become good at the measurements that it takes to figure out what the electrons are doing as they tunneled through various insulators. And I started writing papers about that and giving papers at the conferences. By then, there was an IEEE workshop on electron devices. In those days, you could gather together all the people that were doing leading-edge work, and put them in one room, and there might be 30 of them. And so it was a great place to get to know everybody that was doing related stuff, and hear what they were doing, and have arguments over dinner, and it was just marvelous. What had happened was when I did my thesis, we had connections—by \"we\" I mean the Caltech EE department—had connections at GE Research Lab and RCA Research Lab, which were both major leading-edge research labs in those days. This would've been early '60s. Nobody knows RCA anymore. But they were a leading supplier of transistors in the early days.\n\nZIERLER: And did RCA have a culture of basic science like a Bell Labs would have?\n\nMEAD: Absolutely, it was a research lab that was set up—there's a story that I'm only going to remember part of. But as radio became a big market, then a group of companies pooled their radio intellectual property into a particular company, and they called it Radio Corporation of America, and that became the place where they made the vacuum tubes, they made the radios, it was the big leading place. And they had this research lab where they had developed Television, which involved lots of really good technology.\n\nZIERLER: So if this was your area, this is where you would go even over an IBM or a Westinghouse or a Bell Labs?\n\nMEAD: IBM had not yet gotten very far in this business. Bell Labs of course had invented the transistor, and they always pretended to be the only ones that knew anything. And that earned them lots of enemies because everybody else was doing a bunch of stuff that rapidly outran what the Bell guys were doing. And the Bell guys didn't like to admit that. And there were a lot of humorous incidents that I can tell you about. But it meant the rest of us kind of had a common enemy. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And so we made lots of friends over, you know, \"we're going to get those guys!\" [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: Right. [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And there was a great competitive environment. I think that helped. Just gets the juices flowing, you know. I got invited to RCA to give a talk because they had heard that I was doing interesting work. And there was a guy there by the name Al Rose who had been very active inventing the picture tubes for television. RCA was the place way ahead in television. And Al had been a key guy at the device end of it for picture tubes. There were Iconoscopes and all kind of \"…oscopes\" that were used as picture tubes. But the way they worked is the image that was shined on the face of the picture tube fell on phosphor that would then release electrons. And the early ones worked just like that.\n\nBut it turns out if you get one electron per photon, you need an awful lot of light to make a picture. So the RCA guys worked very hard to put gain in the phosphor, and that's a physics problem. And they were able to do that to get gain of I think thousands in the phosphor itself. So you get 1,000 electrons out for every photon in. Well, that's a major technology, and Al was one of the guys that had contributed a lot to it. There's a similarity there—-every pixel's an electron device that has a gain of 1,000, right? That's a lot of physics in there.\n\nSo, of course, he became the guy that related to the device physics of these new amplifying transistor-like things. And he heard that I was doing stuff, and so he invited me to come to RCA and give a talk, and then took me out to dinner, and he sort of took a liking to me. And he was the one person that saw something in this young whippersnapper that didn't have a first clue of any of the stuff that East Coast people were experts on. I had never had a course on any of it—Caltech didn't have a course in solid-state physics! I had never heard of it. And our physicists acted like they had never heard of it.\n\nSo, but anyway, Al sort of took me under his wing, and got me invited to these little meetings, and invited to give talks there. And so that was the way I became a member of the active people in the field. And without Al Rose, I would've been more like an outsider looking in. It was bad enough the way it was, but that would have been much worse!\n\nZIERLER: Carver, what do you think Al saw in you that you might not have even seen in yourself at that time?\n\nMEAD: I suspect it was the fact that I found my own way of thinking about things instead of remembering what I read in a book someplace. I read a lot of stuff but, you know, it's different than taking a class, and memorizing stuff, and all that. And I think he probably had done that himself, and appreciated it. And he was a wonderful mentor. In just the little bit of time that I was able to spend with him, we developed a real bond.\n\nZIERLER: What did you learn from him?\n\nMEAD: All kinds of stuff. I remember one time I was trying to calculate something about this transistor, and Al said to me, \"Well, Carver, the current is the charge in transit divided by the transit time, just that.\" Duh—of course it is. But Al had a way of seeing the essence of the thing. I'll never forget the time he said that. Yes, you could just eliminate the people writing these god-awful equations to try to represent what was happening in a transistor. And here's one equation, Click! It just captures the whole thing. And then you have to figure out what those two numbers are, but that's it in a nutshell.\n\nAnd so it was a lot of his way of thinking, and just those little nuggets that I would treasure. When he gave a talk, he would always drop one or two of those clicks. So, he was a wonderful, wonderful coach, even though I didn't spend much time with him. Years later, we got him to come spend a sabbatical at Caltech—many years later—and I was able to thank him for really being my coach.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, when did—\n\nMEAD: And that's really—Yes.\n\nZIERLER: When did you first connect with Gordon Moore?\n\nMEAD: Oh, interesting. It was 19…\n\nZIERLER: Before you defended, like '58, '59, around then?\n\nMEAD: I think just after. I think it was '59. Because I remember I was teaching an undergraduate class and lab, the first one at Caltech that had ever used transistors. They had a circuits class they taught to, I think, juniors that talked about how you made circuits out of devices. And it had always been done with vacuum tubes, and they said, \"Hey, you're into transistors…do you want to take a run at it with transistors?\" And I said, \"Sure, I'll do that.\"\n\nGordon was a Caltech grad—He graduated four years before I did, and was one of the founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. And so, of course, it was his job to come back to Caltech and recruit. So he would go around and visit faculty people and ask them if they had any really good students. And somebody said, \"Well, go see Carver because he's teaching this transistor course.\" And of course, Fairchild was a transistor company, so it made sense.\n\nSo, Gordon waltzed into my office—I was working away on something—and, unannounced, and said, \"Hi, I'm Gordon Moore from Fairchild.\" And I of course knew about Fairchild because they were obviously a leading-edge place by then. But I'd never heard of Gordon Moore. And I said, \"Oh, hi, how are you?\" —you know—I'm delighted to have a connection there. And he said, \"I understand you're teaching a lab with transistors.\" I said, \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd in those days, the transistor we had was a CK722 made by Raytheon, and it cost $1, and this was in 1959. And they were very fragile, and their upper frequency was only about a megahertz. And I had read about the Fairchild transistors, but they were tens of dollars, and no way I could afford one. And the students would often burn them out anyway, and so you needed more than one. So, I said, \"Yes, I'm teaching a class.\" He said, \"Would you like some transistors for the lab?\"\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And I said, \"Yes.\" [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: Yes, please. [laugh]\n\nMEAD: And so he turned around, and he had one of these—I don't know if you've ever seen one. The old—there was a style of briefcase in the old days that's sort of like a clamshell on the top, and it opened up like this. He had one of those. And he opened it up, and he reached in, and he had a sock, and then there was another sock. And [laugh] I was looking at this, and then he turned around with two socks in his hand, and he said, \"I travel light.\" [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: A wonderful man. And that was my first meeting with Gordon Moore. And then he reached in and he pulled out a manila envelope, you know, 8½ by 11 manila envelope and it was bulging. And he said, \"Here, these are 2N697s.\" (the 697 was their first product—-it was a core-driver for magnetic-core memories—-it was not a device you'd really want to use for logic or anything because it was for higher currents).\n\nI'd never seen so many transistors! But then—he reached in and he pulled out another Manila envelope bulging just as well, and he said, \"These are 2N706s.\" The 706 was their first logic transistor, and it was beautiful! And of course I knew about these devices, I just couldn't afford one. And so that was our first meeting.\n\nAnd then he got to asking me what I was doing research-wise, and I told him about some of the tunneling stuff, and some of the work I'd done in the thesis. And he said, \"Would you like to come up and give a talk about that?\" \"Sure.\" [laugh] So, two weeks later, I flew up there and visited. My freshman roommate at Caltech (Pete Lauritsen) had gone to work there, and so I visited with him, and he showed me what was going on what he was working on. And then I got to meet other people.\n\nAnd then Gordon and—I think it was maybe Bob Noyce, but I'm not absolutely sure. But they took me out to dinner, and we had a great discussion of which I don't remember the details. But at the end of it, they said, \"Would you like to consult for us?\" Well, I'd just gone to heaven, because they were the place doing the leading-edge work in device physics, and I could work with them. And I knew that was my big break because I had been consulting—I think I told you—with Pacific Semiconductors, and that was a fantastic experience. And these guys were the next step beyond that.\n\nAnd so I had—by stumbling into it—had been able to collaborate with the leading-edge people in the field. And what's your chances—that a kid that had no background in any of this would get that chance. It was wonderful! So I began my every week commute up to Silicon Valley in early '60s, and I don't remember if '61 or so, but it was in there.\n\nZIERLER: Was it called Silicon Valley even back then, or you're sort of putting this name, you know, in retrospect?\n\nMEAD: Oh, no, much later, much later. These companies were invisible at the time—I mean, there were big companies there like Hewlett-Packard who made instruments, and Eitel-McCullough, and Varian, who did big vacuum tubes, and these were the big electronics companies. And little Fairchild was, you know, just a little start-up, and nobody was paying much attention to them.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, can you describe a little, so that we understand the historical context, the aura and the exoticism of the transistor? Why exactly is it so special, and what are the major problems that it seeks to resolve?\n\nMEAD: The transistor was a holy grail because of the size and the heat that vacuum tubes took to make any sizeable electronics. The radios of the day were six-tube or eight-tube radios. And people worked hard to get two tubes inside of one so that they could call it a five-tube radio, and the tubes gave off a lot of heat. And that was just an AM receiver!\n\nThe first application for a transistor that really took off was the hearing aid. I remember my grandfather had a hearing aid that had a vacuum tube in it. And he carried around this big thing on his belt that had great big batteries in it, and this box that had a single little vacuum tube in it, and then little wires that went up to his ears. And it was just an audio amplifier. So that was the first thing to go to transistors because they used much less power. And to make an audio amplifier doesn't require high performance.\n\nBut I think everybody got it that we could make them faster. We just had to figure it out. And so everybody knew it was going to be the way you built computers in particular. So, in a way, it gave us all a common vision. We all had different ideas about how to get there, of course. And that made it fun because you could argue over drinks would this be a best way or would that be the best way? But we all knew in our gut that it was going to be the way electronics went.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, did you ever think about entering industry full-time, and leaving Caltech?\n\nMEAD: Yes. But once I started consulting with the Fairchild people, we got this dynamic going where they had lots of people working on projects, but they had to get product out. And a product had to work, and it had to be reliable. And that was what they did. They had to do that because it was life or death for that little company. And so they had lots of physics problems that they couldn't spend time on.\n\nSo I'd go up there on Thursday night, and stay over, and then end up early morning at Fairchild Research Lab. And Gordon was an early guy too. So, about seven o'clock, we'd both be there, and we'd sit and talk for an hour, and then other people would start showing up, and I'd go off and spend time with the people doing the stuff that I thought I could help with. And then at the end of the day, I'd come back, and Gordon and I would talk through what I found out and what I did and all that sort of thing. And then probably once a month, we'd go off and get Betty and go off to dinner together, and just get to know each other better.\n\nAnd the people I'd work with, they'd have these issues or sometimes there were problems, sometimes they were opportunities. But I looked at them as research opportunities. So, there'd be some question come up, and so I'd say, \"Hey, give me some samples, and I'll go work on that.\" Well, for them, it was like having another person that could work on stuff that they didn't have to tend or spend money on or anything.\n\nAnd for me, it was a source of leading-edge structures—semiconductor structures—and that I could measure and figure out. And then it became clear that being at Caltech was a heck of a lot better than being in industry because I didn't have to just get the thing shipped, I could go understand it, and yet I had access to the technology. So that started a run of quite a number of years of just this synergistic working together, and that was marvelous.\n\nZIERLER: So consulting allowed you to—it was really the best of both worlds. You had access to the technology, but you could remain in an academic environment.\n\nMEAD: Exactly, and go at it my own way, and it didn't have to be solving this particular production problem.\n\nZIERLER: Why not make your commuting a little easier, and set up shop at Berkeley or Stanford?\n\nMEAD: Well, I did end up chatting with the Stanford guys at one point, but nothing ever came of it—I'm not sure why not. But I was going strong, and it would've taken a lot to make it worthwhile to move.\n\nZIERLER: And, Carver, what is your home department at Caltech after you defend, and you're part of the faculty? Do you have joint appointments?\n\nMEAD: No, it was always EE. We had Murray Gell-Mann in physics, and he called what I did \"squalid-state physics.\" Dick Feynman always liked the stuff I was doing, and we collaborated a little a few times, and ended up doing a course together in 1981, but that was much later. They were basically hostile to device physics—especially since it was so applied. I mean, there were these devices, and there was physics in them but it wasn't their kind of physics!\n\nZIERLER: Would Gell-Mann ever come around? Would he ever regret calling it squalid-state physics?\n\nMEAD: No, he never did. But Steve Wolfram did, who was Gell-Mann's star student. Much later when I was doing the neuromorphic stuff, he would come to my group meeting once in a while, and we'd have dinner—-it was an amiable relationship. But then, it just wasn't way they thought—except for Dick.\n\nAnd he and I could relate because he had a way of conceptualizing things that was really good. And I had followed him around when I was student. And whenever he'd give a seminar, I'd show up and listen—I couldn't understand the math at all, but the way he described the physics I found really inspiring. So I would always go to his talks, no matter what they were on, because he had that way of conceptualizing things.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how your consulting shaped your research agenda? In other words, would you take your cues from what was going on in industry, and then use that—these developments as a starting point for the kinds of things that you wanted to research on campus, or would you start with ideas on campus, and then take these ideas to your friends in industry, and see how they might be applied? How did that process usually work?\n\nMEAD: It was inextricably interwoven with what was going on in industry—not just at Fairchild, but I knew these other people at RCA and later on at Ford Research Labs. And some guys in the Netherlands—Philips Eindhoven had a research lab, and I had some good friends there, and we collaborated on stuff. And so, fortunately, thanks to Al Rose—and my introductions to people around the world at these meetings, I was always getting in discussions with these other people, and there are cross-links there all the time.\n\nAnd the closest collaborations were at Fairchild but I also consulted for Texas Instruments at the same time I was consulting with Fairchild. And I just told them, \"Look, don't ask me about the other company. You wouldn't want me telling them about what you're doing, so I don't carry stories.\" And so I did that for quite a number of years. And I got samples from people at TI and at other places. So it became a way of life of collaborating with people, and doing joint projects—-we could each bring something important.\n\nSo—-how the ideas started—any of these things, by the time it became a research project that was well-defined, it had been through an awful lot of just thinking about \"What if we did this? Could we do that?\" You know, that sort of thing. And, \"OK, you have this kind of material. Let me measure it in this way, and then we'll see what happens\", and then we write a joint paper. And that was a marvelous way of working.\n\nI've always enjoyed collaborating with other people, and it's become sort of a way of life with me. I enjoy the discussions and the fact that somebody has a different set of ideas, and the camaraderie that comes from working together on a hard problem. And so, in a milieu like that, it's really hard to remember who had what idea. And the most important collaboration that I had—let me take a break.\n\nZIERLER: Sure thing, take your time.\n\nMEAD: And then we'll talk about my first important collaboration, OK?\n\nZIERLER: OK.\n\n[pause]\n\nMEAD: So, this actually goes back to the tunneling story, which we were in the middle of, and then went onto other stuff. I was making these in films and understanding the tunneling, but I had an ulterior motive, and that was to make it a device that worked by electron tunneling. And the idea was that if you were lucky in the tunneling process—the tunneling process is inherently lossless. But of course there can be stuff in the forbidden region of whatever you're tunneling through that disrupts that. But suppose you're lucky—I mean, these are very thin films. They were, in those days, 40 or 50 angstroms. And I would put a high electric field on them, and electrons would tunnel through them. And when the electrons came out the other side, if you were lucky, they had a lot of energy—-a few electron volts. And that would be enough that, if the electrode—the second electrode, the one that has that lower energy, so they're tunneling into it—if it was thin, they could go all the way through it, and come out the other side. So that would be a controlled source of electrons. Well, that's what a transistor is, a controlled source of electrons, and you pick them up somehow.\n\nThe first way I tried to pick them up is I made the little devices very thin, and then I put them in a vacuum, and put a positive piece of metal near the surface and measured to see if any electrons came out. And, lo and behold, some electrons came out—not a lot. It was like a 10 to minus 4 of the electrons that went in. And it depended on the thickness of the metal how many came through. So, I was getting information about how electrons lost energy, a high-energy electron (like a few eV over its Fermi level in the metal) how far they went before they scattered because the fraction that would come out went down exponentially with the thickness of the metal. Well, that was interesting!\n\nThere weren't as many as I thought, but they were nicely measurable. So I had done these measurements. Also, instead of putting the electrons out into a vacuum, I put another insulator, and then another metal, so it was a triode, and I could get electrons into the third metal as well. I did both experiments, and worked up what was happening in the metal. And the physicists, of course, had data on how far electrons went in metals because they had their electron beams. And they showed me these plots that the lower the energy, the bigger the attenuation. So by the time you got down to a few eV, they weren't going to go anywhere at all.\n\nAnd they were happy to make clear to me that I was in a dead-end street. But actually, what I was seeing was a well-defined range of electrons that was around 10 angstroms. It turned out that what happened was as the energy electrons got lower and lower, they scattered worse. But then when they got down to a few eV, there weren't that many states for them to scatter into, so the range went back up again, and nobody had measured that. So, it was one of these meetings out on the East Coast someplace, and I gave a talk about this. And it turned out there was another guy there from Bell, a guy by the name of Bill Spitzer, who had done a related experiment by shining a light on a metal. By knowing how far the light went into the metal, he could figure out where the electrons were coming from. And he was seeing that they were coming from pretty deep in the metal by photoemission.\n\nAnd our numbers were comparable, so we got together afterwards, and we were both very excited because this was a new finding in the world of physics, and nobody believed it. And he had the same experience I had, that people told him he was nuts. And so we had dinner that night, and we had a great talk about all this. And he said, \"Hey, next time you're on the East Coast, come by, and I'll show you the lab.\" And I said, \"Great. And, if you're going to get down our way, come back Caltech, and we'll host you, and you can give a talk.\"\n\nAnd, you know, we were going to do this. So, next time I was going on a trip to the East Coast, I wrote to Bill at Bell, and said, \"I'm going to be on the East Coast on such and such a day. I'd love to come visit you.\" And in those days, we wrote letters to people. It's inconceivable today, but that's what we did. Well, I didn't hear back from him, but he had said \"I'll be around.\"\n\nSo I went to see RCA and then I showed up at Bell, and told the lady at the desk that I was there to see Bill Spitzer. And she was taking an inordinately long time to find Spitzer. And finally I came back to the desk, and said, \"Is there a problem?\" She said, \"Well, he doesn't work here anymore.\"\n\nWow! So then I said, \"Well, do you have a contact where I can reach him?\" And she said, \"Well, let me let you talk to personnel.\"—what we now call HR they called it personnel back then. So she put me on with the lady in personnel. And she said, \"Well, I have an address and a phone number, and he's at Bell and Howell Research Center in Pasadena, California, and here's his phone number.\" He's in Pasadena!\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: So, I thought, \"That's great. We'll be able to work together.\" I imagined that, if he was going to move, he probably got real busy, and couldn't remember to tell everybody. So, when I got back to the lab, I called him over at Bell and Howell Research Center in Pasadena. It was right on my way from home to Caltech.\n\nAnd I said, \"Hi, Bill, this is Carver.\" \"Oh, Carver, oh, I forgot to tell you I was moving out here.\" And I said, \"I bet you don't have lab yet.\" And he said, \"You're right.\" I said, \"Well, until you get one set up, how'd you like to come over, and we'll work together over here?\" And he said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful.\"\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: So he came over the next morning, and we had breakfast together. In those days, there weren't many journals—there was the Physical Review. I don't think there was a Physical Review Letters yet. It came shortly in that time period. And there was a Journal of Applied Physics. And so basically, every month when you got your mail, you'd look at the table of contents of those two journals, and if there was anything new, it'd be there. And, of course, the Journal of Applied Physics was getting loaded up with device physics papers, because that was the place where things were happening.\n\nZIERLER: Not squalid-state anymore, right?\n\nMEAD: Not—the Caltech physics department hadn't figured it out, but everybody else had.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: So, there was a paper in the latest issue by Bube and Williams who were at RCA, and I knew them of course because I had been by there several times. And they had made Schottky barriers by putting Copper on cadmium sulfide. It was a II-VI semiconductor, and it was in the class of materials that RCA knew a lot about because of the phosphor work I told you about. So, they could make crystals of them, and they could do all kinds of measurements. So it was natural that they would look at that class of materials, not just the group 4 materials like germanium and silicon. And so they had shined light on a Schottky barrier on a metal—a little metal dot on the surface of cadmium sulfide.\n\nAnd, of course, when you shine a light on it, it excites electrons in the metal, and some of them go across the top of the energy barrier and get into the cadmium sulfide. The number that can get over the barrier from the metal changes with the photon energy, (the wavelength of the light), so you can figure out how high the barrier is. They had worked the thing out, and had all the theory and everything, and it was a really beautiful paper. And it had just come out the day before. So when Bill showed up for breakfast, I said, \"Did you see the Bube and Williams' paper in JAP?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I thought it was a really beautiful paper.\" And he said, \"Well…\" I said, \"What's wrong? You know something I…?\" He said, \"Well, I stopped by RCA just before I moved, and did you notice that they used copper as the metal? And did you notice they deposited it out of a chemical solution instead of vacuum-evaporating it?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, I thought it was a little odd.\" He said, \"I asked them why they did that? And they said that if they vacuum-evaporated it, they didn't get the photoresponse. And they never said that in the paper.\" I said, \"Oh, my goodness, that's fraud.\" I said, \"Let's go get them.\" So, we bought—I may have had some cadmium sulfide, but, if not, you could buy it from Eagle-Picher, which was a company that was set up during the war to make semiconductors for the Rad Lab.\n\nAnd I don't know if it was specific for that, but they continued after the war supplying crystals of all kinds to people that wanted them, and they were very good to deal with. So either I had some or we ordered it, and we got it right away. At very short wavelengths, you can excite electron-hole pairs in the material across the band gap, and so you get a lot of photoresponse. And then as you go to longer wavelengths, you don't have enough photon energy to excite across the band gap. And then what's left are the electrons in the metal—-the only place you can get current is exciting electrons in the metal across the barrier into the semiconductor.\n\nSo what it looks like when you plot how much photoresponse you get as a function of the photon energy, you get a big response up at high photon energies, and then at the band energy you get this steep drop—for materials, the II-VI materials, it's very, very sharp, as good as the resolution of your monochromator. And it drops several orders of magnitude down. And then out to longer wavelengths, you have this response from the metal. And Bill and I had both done our own versions of this experiment. We knew it inside out and backwards.\n\nThat's how you determined what the barrier heights were. And we had both done it, so I was all set up for it. So we did it, and we noticed that the drop—they published their curves, so we could tell exactly what was going—the drop they had only went down about two orders of magnitude. And then they started having this—what they thought was a photo-response from the metal. Well, when we did it, it dropped by four orders of magnitude before you got any. Well, four orders of magnitude down, now you've got scattered light, and you're not sure.\n\nAnd we got something, and I said, \"Bill, we've got to get higher intensity,\" and he said, \"Oh, somebody makes a 10:1 off-axis focusing ellipsoid mirror.\" So this is what you get when you work with a guy who's done it for years. They know every place that has every optical thing, and he knew this one. Well, a factor of 10 and spot size is a factor of 100 in intensity, and it's actually better than that because the light from the monochromator is diverging. So this thing would probably give us three orders of magnitude advantage—so I called them up and asked them to rush it. And within a week, we had that mirror. And I had a machinist working with me at the time, who built up a nice little rig to put the off-axis ellipsoidal mirror in front of the exit slit of my monochromator. And so within two weeks, we had this thing running, and then we had three orders of magnitude more light. And you go down four orders of magnitude, and there's the photoresponse, and it's two orders of magnitude below where the RCA guys were.\n\nSo they had never seen a response from the metal, and what they were seeing was the response from goop on the surface due to their chemical deposition. So that was my introduction to (a) the joy of working with a Bell guy who knew all the ropes, and (b) the treachery of believing people, even good people from a good place, that might just omit telling you of a key thing that makes their results meaningless. It wasn't just they were off a little bit. They're results were meaningless! I'd never even imagined that people in that situation would do that. Of course, I've experienced it many times since. So that started a wonderful collaboration—and once again, the common enemy thing gives you more juice. So we did a series of maybe five years of Spitzer and Mead, and Mead and Spitzer papers where we just take turns of who was first author, and a just wonderful partnership. And that was the other lucky break I had was having—so, you see, my life has been a series of lucky breaks, yes, without which there wouldn't be much to talk about. [laugh].\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] Carver, I want to ask you, at some point probably pretty early on, Caltech gets wind of the fact that you are now collaborating in areas that are soon to be tremendously economically successful. In other words, there's a lot of commercial value to many of the projects that you're working on. So I'm curious, in what ways did Caltech look to protect your intellectual property, its intellectual property? How—what was Caltech's approach to the kinds of things that you were working on collaborating in industry that would soon be of enormous commercial value in the market?\n\nMEAD: That's a good question. They were pretty clueless. I knew about patents. I think because I had—as a kid, I used to admire people like Ben Franklin and George Westinghouse and, you know, Tom Edison, and read about them. And patents loomed large in the history of early ideas. And so I had always thought of if I do something important, I should patent it.\n\nSo I did patent a number of things, including this triode made with tunneling, which of course never turned into a major device, and quite a number of other things. And they were cooperative. I had come to know a good patent attorney because of the Pacific Semiconductor guys—-they had a good patent attorney. I had talked to one of their people, and they said, \"Oh, you should work with Marty Horn, he's a really good patent attorney.\"\n\nSo I told the Caltech guys, \"Hey, I want to patent this thing, and Marty Horn is the guy that does a good job.\" So they called up Marty Horn and said, \"Hey, we'll pay for it,\" and I just did it, you know, and they were cooperative. I don't remember having any tussle over it. But I don't remember them being particularly interested—not like anybody got excited or anything. It was like, \"Oh, Yes, it's a good idea, so we'll patent it.\"\n\nZIERLER: And at what point did you realize—\n\nMEAD: And none of them ever turned into anything.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh] At what point did you realize that, you know, a company like Intel was going to corner the market, and make billions and billions of dollars in profits? At what point did it dawn on you that there were enormous, enormous profits to be earned in these industries?\n\nMEAD: Well, I knew enough. I had always been interested in business. And I knew enough to know that Fairchild was going to make a lot. They were a successful company. And then of course, I was badge number 5 at Intel because I had been consulting for Gordon. And he just said, \"Hey, we're going to do this new thing, and would you like to continue consulting?\"\n\nAnd I went, \"Oh, Yes, of course.\" And so I learned a lot from being part of the Intel start-up. And Bob Noyce—I had just been on a \"hi, Bob\" basis with him, but when we started Intel, I had a lot of dinners with Bob. And at one point when we were both single, we used to double-date—so we got to know each other really well. And Bob was a very acute businessman, and I learned a lot from him, probably more than from anybody else.\n\nAnd, yes, it was obvious there was a lot of money to be made, but also there were a lot of people after the same bucks, and the competition was fierce in the early days of semi. And now it's a highly saturated market, so it's not in the exponential phase like it was back then. But it became pretty obvious that if you hit upon the right thing, and if you could keep ahead of other people who would have more resources, you could make a company that was successful. And that's of course a thing that I've helped students do with starting start-ups.\n\nThat's the mechanism by which I participated in these opportunities. And of course, I think I've been involved in about between 25 and 30, depending on how you count. And there have only been a few that have made it to being public companies, which is what you expect. I got to know—one of the great things about the Intel start-up was they were just starting it, and so they included me in the process—not because I could add anything business-wise, but because I would ask questions. And I think they just liked to have another pair of eyes that thought differently.\n\nBut, anyway, they would take me along on meetings. And I got to meet Art Rock. And Art Rock was the number one venture capitalist in the western US. And he funded Intel, and I learned a lot from Art and from being part of the process, just watching, and being included in the process.\n\nYou may be lucky if you hit 10%. They're all wonderful opportunities or you wouldn't get involved. But then what really works out is maybe 10% if you're lucky. I think mostly they say 5%. And then there's probably another 10% that get acquired, and you come out OK but not great. And then the others—you either lose all your money or you about break even or whatever. So, that's been a great learning experience, and I know a lot of things not to do now, a lot more than I did back then.\n\nZIERLER: [laugh]\n\nMEAD: But not enough to not have a new problem that I didn't see coming.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, I'm curious. By the mid-1960s, you're involved in a lot of research that would become foundational to wireless electronics and to telecommunication systems generally. And so I'd like to know – was your goal to develop research that would be useful for wireless and telecommunication systems, or was the research sort of just basic and then this is naturally where it led?\n\nMEAD: Oh, that's an absolutely great question. I'm drawn to things that work. And it can be a basic science thing, or it can be a commercial opportunity which is technology-based, or it can be somewhere in the middle. And what draws me is the ability to figure something out that's central to whatever the thing is. And it's always better if there's use for it.\n\nBut most things don't work out—well, it was like this transistor thing I did, you know, the tunnel transistor. It didn't go anywhere. I learned a lot. But it led to another level of understanding, and led to me getting involved with Bill Spitzer, and then that led to the study of surface states on semiconductors because we were looking at barrier heights of Schottky barriers.\n\nAnd Bill of course had known John Bardeen, who had figured out that it was surface states that were why the Bell couldn't make the original kind of transistor that they set out to make. And so he knew about that. So we published a whole set of papers on surface states. Well, it turns out that by understanding the surface states and how they work—where they were in the band gap, I figured out why Shockley's original Schottky barrier field-effect transistor had not worked.\n\nAnd so I built one over the Thanksgiving holiday, I think it was '65. And it was the first Schottky barrier gate field-effect transistor that actually worked! It is a pure majority carrier device, and it has a metal gate so it doesn't have a problem with the conductivity of the gate fighting against the transfer efficiency—because there's always that fight with a minority carrier device. It is a beautiful device!\n\nIt turned out Bell had tried very hard—I didn't know this at the time—and they had failed to be able to make one to work because of the energy of the surface states on Germanium. They knew about surface states. John Bardeen had explained it to them. But the location on germanium was too close to the valance band, so it would inject holes instead of being a barrier for a field-effect device. And I used Gallium Arsenide because it's surface states are located close to the middle of the gap, and it had a wider band gap. Also had a lot higher mobility, so it made beautiful devices.\n\nAnd those are devices that are still used—they're fantastic for RF transmitters. An RF transmitter uses a Class-C amplifier because it's very efficient—when you have to make power like you do in a final amplifier of a transmitter, you want it to be very efficient. So, you have a tuned circuit in which the transmitted wave is resonating in the tuned circuit. So at the very bottom of the cycle, when the voltage on the tuned circuit is very close to zero, that's when you want to put the charge through the device, and you want to put a lot of it right there. Well, if you try to do that with a minority carrier device, you forward-bias the emitter-base junction, and flood the base region all those minority carriers, and they just ruin the efficiency. And if you use a junction field-effect device, which is one that Bell Labs made—it wasn't the first one but it was a device they had come up with, then you had the same problem.\n\nYou forward-bias the gate—-but with a Schottky barrier, it isn't a semiconductor. It doesn't inject minority carriers when it's forward biased. So you can go right up into forward bias with it, and never get any minority carriers in there to ruin the efficiency of the device. Of course, I had been a radio amateur, so I had built a lot of transmitters, and I knew exactly what you had to do to make them really efficient. And this device did that.\n\nSo, you know, it was all over the map. There was never a single thing that was like, \"Oh, I got to make this device, and solve all the problems.\" It was like, \"Oh, I now know enough to make that.\" And that device was the one that Lilienfeld had invented originally, in 1926. I gave a talk like maybe a year ago at Caltech about the history of semiconductors. And I told Lilienfeld's story because I was so pleased to be the first one that had ever made Lilienfeld's device work.\n\nAnd he was an amazing inventor, and scientist as well. But, for me, it never had to be one way or the other. It was kind of like: whatever is left to be figured out, go figure it out if you can. And of course, there are many more things I tried to figure out that I never have because it's just the way it works. And you don't know till you've figured it out if you're going to be able to or not.\n\nZIERLER: Were you envisioning as early as the mid-1960s that people would be able to talk on cellular telephones, unwired?\n\nMEAD: No. Gordon and I—of course, it was '65 when he put his Moore's Law paper out, and then of course I started working on transistor scaling. And we both wrote about what you're going to be able to do as you make faster and lower power and more complex integrated circuits.\n\nAnd we both saw a lot of things that would be made better by doing that. But the cellular network, it wasn't that you couldn't imagine a—I mean, I built transmitters. I built receivers. I knew about that. But you must remember that was only a few years after the Consent Decree—\n\nZIERLER: Right. [laugh] Right.\n\nMEAD: —where IBM could do computers, and Bell could do communications, but they must not go into each other's field. Well, in that environment, there's no hope. The problem isn't technical. The problem is this horrible political stuff!\n\nZIERLER: Bifurcation.\n\nMEAD: Yes, Yes, the bureaucratic nightmare of ultimate proportion, right? Consent Decree!\n\nZIERLER: And did you get at the time that this division was harmful for technological advance?\n\nMEAD: Oh, yes. Yes. In fact, I have a slide about that. When I was evangelizing Moore's Law, I would go round and give talks about Moore's Law, and how it's going to change the world. And Gordon did too. We sort of took turns with opportunities to do that. I would do it from the point of view of you could scale these devices, and you could scale them much further than anybody thought.\n\nAnd Gordon was doing it from the point of view of, \"Hey, we're doing this now, and we're going to keep doing it, and the economics of it are unbelievable. Let me show you.\" So, we kind of came at it from two different angles. And it was good that we were able to. But I talked about—and I think both of us mentioned—-telephones being a very important application area of communications.\n\nBut I know myself, I didn't think that government was capable of unwinding the mess they had made. But I have a slide that shows two big arrows, one was called Computing, and the other was called Communications, and they were headed for the same place. And then there was—this next slide I showed was an atomic explosion. And then I said, \"Now, what'll the fallout be from this explosion that is going to happen when you can't keep those two things separate?\" So I did see that part, and gave many talks about it.\n\nI always got a good laugh at the—because it depicted the size of the transformation that was coming. And then I had a slide that showed all the applications that would fall out of that. And of course phones were I think one of the things there, but there was all kinds of other stuff too. But the fact that it would become possible to have the kind of RF spectrum usage we have today, when we had a Consent Decree, it never occurred to me that government could allow a thing like that to happen. I just couldn't see it.\n\nZIERLER: Carver, one thing that the government was getting good at in the 1960s was shooting stuff into space, right, leading up to the—you know—the moon landing in 1969. I'm curious when you thought about the possibility of satellites orbiting the planet as a useful point of contact for global communication systems?\n\nMEAD: Oh, that was "
