In 1951—six years before the first magnetic disks—UNIVAC introduced tape drives for computers.Tape was a storage mainstay for many years and still survives, thanks to its low cost, portability, unlimited offline capacity, and standardized formats that make tapes interchangeable.",

        "text": "Magnetophon tape recorder\n\nThe German Magnetophon was used mostly by radio stations, but also for military communications. Its factory was heavily bombed during World War II.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nUNIVAC I System\n\nUNIVAC I used mercury delay lines for main memory and magnetic tape for storage. The tape drives, called “Uniservos,” are shown at the back.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nTape reel (160 MB)\n\nIBM established a standard for 10 1/2 inch tape reels that lasted over 25 years. Over time the recording density and hence the capacity of the tape increased by many times.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nDECtape drive on PDP-11\n\nIntroduced in 1963, reliable and inexpensive DECtape was used in many generations of DEC minicomputers.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nDEC CompacTape cartridge\n\nLater standardized as Digital Linear Tape, this replaced the aging 1960s-era DECtape. DLT evolved dramatically, from 92 MB in 1984 to 800 GB with the 2006 \"SuperDLT\" format.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nIBM 3850 Mass Storage System: honeycomb section with tapes (50 MB)\n\nAs an alternative to a manual tape reel library, IBM introduced this system with 4 inch long cylinders of magnetic tape that were retrieved and replaced by a robotic arm.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nIBM 3480 tape cartridge (200 MB)\n\nThis magnetic tape cartridge was fast, reliable, durable and inexpensive. Introduced in 1984 and first used on mainframe computers, it replaced the standard 10.5\" circular reel of magnetic tape that had been a feature of large computer systems since the 1950s.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nData cassette (1.2MB)\n\nAudio cassettes were used to store data or programs. They were small and inexpensive, but also slow and often unreliable.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nStorageTek 4400 ACS tape library\n\nThis tape robot stored data from experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory), providing medium-speed access to immense amounts of data.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nUNIVAC metal tape reel\n\nSurprisingly heavy, these 1200 foot reels of ½ inch metal tape were used on the UNIVAC I computer’s “Uniservo” tape drive, the first tape storage device for computers. Each metal tape held about 3MB.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nIBM 726 magnetic tape drive\n\nThe IBM 726 introduced inexpensive coated plastic tape for data storage. Clever vacuum column tape buffers allowed the tape to start and stop quickly.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nDEC VAX with Digital Linear Tape (DLT) drive\n\nDesigned originally by DEC, DLT technology was purchased by Quantum in 1994. The drive wrote 22 data tracks back and forth on ½” wide tape.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nIBM 3850 mass storage system\n\nThe largest 3850 storage system held 4,720 cartridges, stored 236 GB, and was 20 feet long.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nIBM 3480 magnetic tape subsystem\n\nThis drive read and wrote 18 tracks of data simultaneously on ½” tape. Each cartridge held 200 MB.\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nCommodore PET\n\nThe PET’s built-in cassette tape drive made it the standard way to load programs.\n\nView Artifact Detail"
