        "text": "We live in the golden age of electronic marine navigation: an age where any inner-tube on the water can have sophisticated onboard navigation equipment onboard (any number of Nav apps on a waterproof phone); where OpenCPN and a five dollar GPS UPS stick (w/ free NOAA US Nav charts) provides a powerful navigation system for a variety of hosts and where dedicated multi-function can be had for less than $300 2024 US dollars.\n\nRunning a few years before was the consumer navigation revolution for cars. Ubiquitous today on phones and built in to modern cars, once di rigur was having an (expensive!) add on gizmo sitting on the dashboard. Today these expensive pioneers of car navigation are relegated to the dollar bin at Salvation Army.\n\nElectronic navigation on land, sea and air was made possible by the result of a series of converging technologies.\n\nHere is an interesting article about Stan Honey, sailor and navigator and an early company he founded\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n​\n\n\"[Co-founder Stan Honey] was doing military-related research at SRI International in 1983 when he sailed with Pong inventor and Atari founder Nolan Bushnell to victory in a Transpac race. Bushnell was impressed with Honey's navigational electronics and asked whether he had any other ideas. Honey suggested a car navigation system. Bushnell gave him $500,000 in seed money, and digital-mapping firm Etak (named after a Polynesian term for navigation) was born.\"​\n\nEtak's Navigator was the first commercially available automotive navigation system of any practical significance. Etak initially delivered the hardware system, the maps and dynamic content for its automotive navigation system.​\n\n​\n\nEarly Etak product literature claimed that \"Etak\" was an ancient Polynesian term that described navigating intuitively by the stars.​\n\nA thorough and interesting article about Sam Honey's Etak (find the whole article and a full website about modern navigation here:\n\n12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 9\n\nThe Map Happenings series on the hugely impactful events that forever changed our world. This week: the story of a little known company called ‘Etak’. I think you’ll find it a fas…\n\nA Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’​\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.​\n\n​\n\nBut I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.​\n\n​\n\nToday, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system.​\n\n​\n\nHere’s a picture of it:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAt the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley’s San Jose Mercury News said about it:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIt immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.​\n\n​\n\nMost important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?“)​\n\n​\n\nBefore GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘dead reckoning‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.​\n\n​\n\nTo solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today.​\n\n​\n\nLike all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.​\n\n​\n\nThe second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display. This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.​\n\n​\n\nThird: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHere is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action: ​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAs you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives. ​\n\n​\n\nThe buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen. ​\n\n​\n\nThe top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.​\n\n​\n\nThe address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection. You could also store common locations like home and work.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen. ​\n\n​\n\nThese were soft programmed depending on the current function.​\n\n​\n\nIn the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAnd after that you simply selected the street from a list:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThis is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.​\n\n​\n\nThe lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEtak Navigator System Details​\n\nThere were five key components to the Etak Navigator:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.​\n\n​\n\nThe navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second!​\n\n​\n\nThere was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.​\n\n​\n\nTo determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.​\n\n​\n\nFinally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.​\n\n​\n\nThe cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThat’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.​\n\n​\n\nOn top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nJust Some of the Technical Hurdles​\n\nBack in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.​\n\n​\n\nGPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.​\n\n​\n\nIn addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly. ​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass. ​\n\n​\n\nHere the solution was topological map matching. ​\n\n​\n\nThis invention, above all others, made the product viable.​\n\n​"
