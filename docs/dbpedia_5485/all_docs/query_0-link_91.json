        "text": "Acetaminophen\n\nAcetaminophen: Easier Dosing\n\nAcetaminophen is a very safe medicine when used in recommended doses to treat pain and fever. But too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage and even death. This has happened when parents didn't understand the concentration or measurements. New formulations of acetaminophen for children make it easier to give the correct dose.\n\nAcetaminophen: Take It Safely\n\nAcetaminophen is a very safe drug to take according to label instructions. In overdose, too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. In fact, acetaminophen overdose is an important cause of liver failure and liver transplants in the US.\n\nUse Acetaminophen Safely\n\nAcetaminophen is a safe and effective pain reliever when taken according to label instructions. But in overdose, it is a leading cause of liver damage and death.\n\nCold Medicine Dosing Changes for Kids\n\nThere is no evidence that cough and cold medicines are safe or effective for young children. There IS evidence that children have been harmed by overdoses of these products. Problems include seizures, coma, and death.\n\nActivated charcoal\n\nActivated Charcoal\n\nActivated charcoal is a special form of carbon that can bind other substances on its surface in a process known as adsorption. It is also effective in adsorbing drugs in the gut so the drugs don't enter the body.\n\nAlcohol\n\nWhat is a Hangover and Can It Be Cured?\n\nHangovers are unpleasant symptoms that occur after the consumption of alcohol. Even though many products are marketed as hangover treatments, there is no cure for this condition. The best way to prevent a hangover is to avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.\n\nWhat is a Borg?\n\nA borg, or “black out rage gallon”, typically contains a fifth of vodka, water, and liquid flavor enhancer. Borg drinking is popular among some college students, but consumption of the high amounts of alcohol often found in borgs can cause harmful health effects, similar to those resulting from heavy alcohol use or binge drinking.\n\nAlcohol: A Dangerous Poison for Children\n\nAlcohol can be a dangerous poison for children. Alcohol depresses the central nervous system and causes low blood glucose (sugar). Children who drink alcohol can have seizures and coma; they could even die. This is true of beverage alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) and alcohol found in mouthwash and other personal care products.\n\nIs Alcohol Dangerous?\n\nEthanol, found in alcoholic beverages, is safe for most adults in moderation. Excessive ethanol intake and consumption of other types of alcohol can be dangerous.\n\nInhaling Alcohol Is Dangerous\n\nAlcohol vapors can be produced by heating up alcohol or pouring it over dry ice. Alcohol can be absorbed into your bloodstream by inhaling alcohol vapors. People who inhale alcohol vapors get drunk very quickly, because the alcohol goes straight to the brain. Also, heated alcohol vapor can injure the lungs.\n\nNo, You Can’t Drink Rubbing Alcohol\n\nRubbing alcohol is a widely available household product often used to disinfect wounds. It is most commonly 70% isopropyl alcohol. It can be toxic if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. It is flammable and should always be kept away from open flames.\n\nHiding in Plain Sight: The Danger of Commercial Spiked Beverages\n\nSpiked beverages have become increasingly common. Although they usually do not contain a high percentage of alcohol, many of the brands and names are for products that traditionally have not contained alcohol. This can cause problems when children or unsuspecting adults consume them, believing they are non-alcoholic.\n\nDrunk + Buzzed = Danger\n\nLots of alcohol plus lots of caffeine equals danger, with possible results ranging from sexual assault to automobile crashes to alcohol-induced coma or even death.\n\nMy Child Drank Perfume\n\nMost fragrance products contain alcohol; some contain up to 95%. Alcohol can cause serious effects in children. Fragrance products can also cause skin irritation, which will usually go away if you stop using the product.\n\nTravel Safely: Tips for the Holiday Season\n\nOver the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house - or maybe on a cruise - or perhaps to a hotel in a new city or a foreign country? Wherever your destination for the holidays, by automobile, plane, ship or sleigh, a little planning will help keep holiday travel safe and enjoyable.\n\nHand Sanitizer: What's the Real Story?\n\nHand sanitizers most often contain alcohols that have been FDA-approved for use on the skin. A taste or sip usually does not cause serious symptoms, but ingestion of larger quantities can be hazardous.\n\nAntifreeze\n\nAntifreeze: Bad for Your Kids and Pets\n\nIt is dangerous to swallow antifreeze, even in small amounts. The toxicity of antifreeze develops slowly as the body breaks down the antifreeze (ethylene glycol) into by-products that affect blood chemistry, the nervous system, and the kidneys.\n\nPrevent Cold Weather Poisonings\n\nThere are special poisoning concerns during the winter: family travel, family gatherings, carbon monoxide poisoning, and winter chemicals for the car. Follow Poison Control's prevention tips to keep your family safe this winter.\n\nAspirin\n\nPain Relievers: Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and Aspirin\n\nIbuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They are used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. They are also found in combination products such as cough and cold medicines. An overdose of these medications may cause stomach upset, abdominal pain, and vomiting, kidney damage, ulcers, bleeding, seizures, and coma.\n\nWhat is Aspirin?\n\nAspirin is an over-the-counter medication used as an anti-inflammatory agent and for pain or fever relief. Low dose aspirin is used to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease, and sometimes in pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia. Normal side effects include stomach upset and indigestion. Aspirin overdose can be life-threatening.\n\nBatteries\n\nKids Will Swallow Anything\n\nChildren will swallow anything they can reach. Most of the time, these objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract with no trouble; the object turns up in the child's stool. Sometimes, surgery is needed to remove the object(s). In one recent study, coins made up 80 percent of swallowed foreign objects that had to be removed by surgery.\n\nTape Button Batteries Before Disposing of Them\n\nA recent study of battery injuries found that 29.8% of button battery ingestions involved batteries that were discarded or sitting out. Taping button batteries before disposal can decrease or stop button batteries from causing injury and will not affect the ability of the battery to be recycled.\n\nButton Batteries Can Kill Children\n\nMore and more children are being injured, or even dying, from swallowing button or disk batteries. This tragedy can be prevented. Batteries stuck in the esophagus must be removed as quickly as possible as severe damage can occur in just 2 hours. Batteries in the nose or ear also must be removed immediately to avoid permanent damage.\n\nBatteries Cause Devastating Injuries\n\nSwallowed batteries burn through a child's esophagus in just 2 hours, leading to surgery, months with feeding and breathing tubes, and even death. About the size of a nickel, 20 mm, 3-volt lithium coin cells are the most hazardous as they are big enough to get stuck and burn faster. Secure battery compartments and keep loose batteries away from children.\n\nTravel Safely: Tips for the Holiday Season\n\nOver the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house - or maybe on a cruise - or perhaps to a hotel in a new city or a foreign country? Wherever your destination for the holidays, by automobile, plane, ship or sleigh, a little planning will help keep holiday travel safe and enjoyable.\n\nBuprenorphine\n\nBuprenorphine: Dangerous to Children\n\nBuprenorphine is prescribed for adults with opioid dependence or chronic pain. Most buprenorphine poisoning in children occurs due to improper storage of the medication. Symptoms of buprenorphine poisoning in children are drowsiness, vomiting, slow breathing, increased heart rate, and agitation. Coma and death have also been reported.\n\nCaffeine and stimulants\n\nADHD Drugs: An Overview\n\n\"ADHD\" stands for \"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\". Symptoms include hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and inability to pay attention, manage frustration, stay organized, or focus on tasks. Treatment is based on behavior therapy and/or drug therapy. ADHD drugs can cause side effects; a deliberate overdose of any amount requires immediate medical care.\n\nIs Prime an Energy Drink?\n\nPrime drinks, including Prime Energy, Prime Hydration, and Prime UFC 300 are increasingly popular among children, adolescents, and young adults. Prime products contain coconut water and electrolytes; Prime Energy also contains 200 mg of caffeine per can. Because of its caffeine content, children, pregnant or lactating women, and those who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine should avoid consumption of Prime Energy.\n\nAre Weight Loss Supplements Safe?\n\nMany weight loss supplements contain ingredients that are contaminated, ineffective, dangerous, or actually illegal. Some people become ill after taking these products. Some have interactions with medicines. It can be hard to get your money back. Worst of all, these products often don't help.\n\nDry Scooping Can Be Life-Threatening\n\nPre-workout supplements can contain caffeine and other ingredients which can be poisonous when taken in large amounts. Dry scooping, or consumption of undiluted pre-workout powder, can be life-threatening.\n\nDrunk + Buzzed = Danger\n\nLots of alcohol plus lots of caffeine equals danger, with possible results ranging from sexual assault to automobile crashes to alcohol-induced coma or even death.\n\nHow Much Caffeine is Safe?\n\nSymptoms of caffeine overdose can be mild (shaky hands, stomach upset) to severe (high blood pressure, seizures, coma). Caffeine is found in traditional sources (coffee, tea, chocolate, soda) and many new sources (energy drinks, foods with added caffeine). Children are taking in more and more caffeine, but we don't know how much is safe for children.\n\nHow Much Caffeine Is In That?\n\nThe line between enough caffeine and too much varies from person to person. People who overdo it can experience unpleasant side effects until the caffeine wears off in a few hours. People who take too many caffeine pills to stay awake can have seizures. There have even been some deaths from caffeine overdoses.\n\nIs Matcha Tea Good for You?\n\nMatcha is a bright green powder that is often mixed with hot water to form a tea. Because it has a sweet, non-bitter taste, matcha is also used as an additive in desserts and other foods. Matcha contains high amounts of L-theanine and other compounds that may have beneficial effects on inflammation, metabolism, and gut health.\n\nCarbon monoxide\n\nPlanning a Home Remodel?\n\nSo many poison prevention stories are about children, but when it comes to home remodeling, adults are at risk, too. Children, adults, and pets can become sick if home renovations are not carried out carefully.\n\nCarbon Monoxide and Video Games\n\nShortly after a hurricane in Texas, 75% of children treated for carbon monoxide poisoning had been playing video games powered by portable generators.\n\nPoisons and Pregnancy\n\nThere is a lot of information about avoiding drugs, alcohol, and tobacco while pregnant. There are some other poisons to be aware of if you're pregnant, including herbal medications, supplements, lead, and carbon monoxide.\n\nAnother Reason Not To Smoke\n\nIt is possible for heavy smokers to develop carbon monoxide poisoning. This can be severe enough to require treatment in an emergency room.\n\nCarbon Monoxide: What You Need to Know\n\nIt's not an intriguing or novel hazard, just the persistent, invisible killer: carbon monoxide. Seriously, you still don't have a carbon monoxide alarm in every sleeping area of your home? Get one!
