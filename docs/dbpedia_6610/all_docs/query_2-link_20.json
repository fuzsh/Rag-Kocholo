        "text": "Description of the MARCA\n\nThe MARCA is a 1-d self-report recall questionnaire administered by computer, consisting of three modules, a 1-d activity recall, a compendium of child-specific energy costs, and an analytical module. The MARCA aims to be a self-report questionnaire that:\n\n(a) accurately measures use-of-time and provides good estimates of daily EE (as a multiple of resting metabolic rate) in children;\n\n(b) provides sufficient detail on type, duration, intensity and frequency of activity;\n\n(c) yields varied and flexible outcome measures capable of addressing a number of research questions;\n\n(d) addresses all forms of activity, i.e. organised and non-organised physical activity, sedentary activity, incidental activity, etc.;\n\n(e) covers a recall period that best increases the likelihood of valid data;\n\n(f) minimises researcher burden associated with data entry, analysis and storage;\n\n(g) is a simple and interesting task for children to complete.\n\nThe MARCA asks children to recall their previous day's activities in time slices of 5 min or more. A 1-d recall period was chosen because children's recall has been shown to be more accurate over this period than longer periods of recall [12,18]. The minimum 5 min resolution was chosen to allow for a number of short duration activities to be recalled, e.g. talking on the phone or walking to a friend's house. Short segments of recall are especially important in questionnaires for children as their activity tends to be characterised by short bursts of incidental activity [22]. As recent research suggests, short bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) that accumulate over the day have health benefits [23], it is important that these bouts of activity be recorded.\n\nThe MARCA allows children to recall either a school day or another day (weekend, holiday or day off from school). Previous literature suggests that a child's ability to recall their day in terms of type and frequency is enhanced when the day is segmented [12,24]. A segmented day format also allows the activities to be reported in the context within which they have been performed [25]. The MARCA allows segmentation to be individualised for each subject by allowing each child to set activity time anchor-points, i.e. school breaks for school days and meal times for non-school days. The user drags icons along a timeline (Figure ) to set the anchor points. The sliders do not allow inconsistent settings (e.g. going to bed before dinner). Each of the subsequent MARCA screens then asks the user to report their activity during their individualised segments. These segments are similar to landmarks that resulted in a more comprehensive recall of activity previously identified by McKenna and colleagues in their qualitative interviewing of 8â€“16 year old children [24].\n\nDuring each segment children can choose from over 200 activities grouped into seven categories; inactivity; transport; play/sport; school work; self care; chores and 'other'. The 'other' category contains miscellaneous activities, such as playing musical instruments, which do not fit within the described categories. These activities were chosen by scanning the Ainsworth compendium [17] for activities likely to be undertaken by children, reviewing activity lists within existing physical activity questionnaires and reviewing papers that describe common activities performed by children [26,27]. Pilot testing of the MARCA with children has provided the opportunity to evaluate and refine the activity lists by noting activities that children were having trouble locating within the lists, or activities which they indicated were missing, etc. Having chosen an activity, children indicate the duration of the activity by dragging icons along a timeline that increases in 5 min intervals. A slider above the timeline is dragged to the start time of the activity and a slider below the timeline is dragged to the finish time of the activity (see Figure ). The selection of duration using a scrolling timeline (rather than simply writing a duration in exact minutes into a box) has previously been found to assist children in judging time [20].\n\nSome activities require a subjective intensity ranking. These activities are mostly physical activities such as locomotor activities, games and sports that can be performed at a wide range of intensities. In these cases, an intensity screen asks the user whether the activity was performed at light, medium or hard intensity. As children have difficulty understanding the concept of intensity [28], users are asked whether they need any help to decide. If so, a screen will appear that plays videos of children playing a ball game at varying intensities (see Additional File 1). Trost and colleagues [28] and Tremblay and colleagues [29] concur that videos are effective in helping children understand the concept of physical activity intensity. The videos used in the MARCA were initially developed for use in the Computer-delivered physical activity questionnaire (CDPAQ), a self-report questionnaire developed prior to the MARCA and a more thorough description of their development is available in Ridley et al. [20]. Once an activity has been selected, the name of activity, its identifying code, the start and end time, and duration of activity are recorded. Children continue to add activities to their activity list within each segment of the day, until the end of the day is reached.\n\nThe activity recall is linked to a compendium of energy costs. Each activity within the MARCA is assigned an individual code, loosely based on the system used by Ainsworth and colleagues (2000). The MARCA code consists of six digits which provide information about specific characteristics of each activity [e.g. body position when performing the activity (sitting, standing, etc) and intensity of activity]. The code also links the activities to the compendium of energy costs and assists in undertaking a wide variety of flexible analyses. The MARCA compendium was created after a thorough literature search into the energy cost of children's activities [30]. Due to the lack of energy cost data in children, approximately 70% of the activities in the current compendium use MET levels from the adult data presented in the Ainsworth compendium (2000). However, as data become available on child-specific energy costs, they can be updated in the compendium and all previously collected MARCA profiles can be automatically updated.\n\nOn completion of the recall, children are able to store their profile (a 'profile' is a recall by one child on one day) to the MARCA program or save the profile to an external text file. Diaries can be reloaded from the program or imported from a text file for modification or analysis. The multimedia environment of the MARCA allows for a number of checks, or alerts, to ensure subjects do not enter invalid data. These checks include: range checks on height, weight, age, etc; overlap checks that ensure two activities are not entered during the same time period; and gap checks ensure there aren't any large gaps of time missing. The MARCA also ensures that a maximum of 1440 min (1-d) of activity are entered. These checks attempt to ensure the data collected are as complete as possible. As the MARCA involves almost entirely point and click entries, lost data due to illegible or incomprehensible responses that can occur with pen-and-paper questionnaires are rare. Researcher burden associated with data entry and analysis is also reduced.\n\nThe MARCA's analytical module facilitates analysis of data collected by the 1-d recall. Profiles are imported into the analytical module from MARCA outputs in text files. The analytical module performs a number of data cleaning functions, e.g. locating all instances of 'other' activities and allowing alternatives from the compendium to be chosen (activity and associated energy cost); scanning for evidence of implausible values; etc. These procedures allow researchers to cull profiles where children have not made a genuine effort at recall, and to identify those subgroups in which this is most likely to occur."
