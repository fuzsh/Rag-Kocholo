        "text": "Prince William has reportedly decided that his brother, Prince Harry, will never be allowed to return to the royal family. This revelation comes from British royals expert Hilary Fordwich, who notes that the future king is taking a firm stance on the ongoing rift with his brother.\n\n\"It is widely known within the family that Prince William has laid down an absolute ban on Harry returning in any way, shape or form into his former royal family fold,\" Fordwich told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If anyone will relent, it would be King Charles III, whom, of course, Prince William won't challenge, who still misses his 'darling boy' and would like to see more of Prince Harry.\n\n\"However, to this day, after the release of 'Spare' and the Netflix serial, as well as with everything else Harry has said, done, and not done, it's Prince William who adamantly refuses to even speak to his brother.\"\n\nIs there a way for Prince Harry to be accepted back?\n\nFordwich's comments follow a statement by Grant Harrold, King Charles' former royal butler, who suggested to the New York Post that there is a way for Prince Harry to be accepted back into the royal fold.\n\n\"The only way I see this happening is a public statement from Harry, where you come out and say that you were in a bad space and that [his memoir 'Spare'] was a mistake,\" noted Harrold.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to happen,\" he noted. \"Some bad things were said, and some families never patch things up, and that's how it is... Harry has got a big heart, and a part of him probably wishes things would be different.\""
