        "text": "To be eligible for Amazon Brand Registry, your brand must have an active registered trademark in each country where you wish to enroll or have a pending trademark application filed through Amazon IP Accelerator. Brand Registry is also accepting brands that have a trademark pending registration in a subset of trademark offices (see country-specific requirements section). The trademark for your brand must be in the form of a text-based mark (word mark) or an image-based mark with words, letters, or numbers (design mark). Depending on where your trademark is registered, eligible trademarks can have different classifications based on their issuing trademark office. Examples of trademarks that we currently accept for enrollment are included below:\n\nWe currently only accept trademarks that have been issued by government trademark offices in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Australia, India, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Singapore, Spain, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Sweden, Poland, Benelux, the European Union, and the United Arab Emirates. If your trademark is registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), please submit the corresponding trademark number assigned by the national trademark office as it may differ from the trademark number assigned by WIPO. If your trademark is registered by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), please select EUIPO as your trademark registrar in your application. Brand Registry is not affiliated with any of these offices; please do not contact them for information about Brand Registry. Updates to Brand Registry eligibility criteria will be posted to this page.\n\nIf you are an authorized agent, please have the trademark owner enroll the brand first, and add your account as an additional user. If you meet the eligibility requirements, sign in using your existing Seller or Vendor Central credentials. Using the same username and password will enable access to Brand Registry features and benefits that are linked to Vendor and Seller services. Or, if you donâ€™t yet have an Amazon account, create one for free."
