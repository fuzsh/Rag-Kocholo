        "text": "Marca.com Sells Vicious Gossip\n\nThis Marca \"news medium\" is not a part of professional journalism. It is part of the British slingshot media filled with poisonous gossip, conjectures, one-sided and unverified information, and self-invented stories. Nothing is sacred to this trashy medium. It (as part of the larger negative British media) sells hatred against Prince Harry and his family. Marca never reports both sides of an issue, a process required of true journalism-- to balance both sides of the incident/event being reported.\n\nDate of experience : July 04, 2024\n\nOne of the worst news website I've ever seen. Painful experience\n\nOne of the worst news websites ever (if not the worst). With a top laptop, no matter the browser, the site wastes (to be kind) so many resources that the browser keeps crashing. This has been happening for a loooooong time. Being a developer I can only guess that the code is so old that it has just been adapted here and there without a proper analysis in order to keep the site \"alive\".\n\nNow, regarding the quality of the content ... also sub-par. I guess sport journalism nowadays is at the very bottom of the career. I try to only use it to check the scores but from time to time I read some articles and ... it hurts (most of them: some, in very rare cases, it is worthy a reading).\n\nFinal score: zero! (and this is supposed to be the best Spanish sport news - good lord!)\n\nDate of experience : January 02, 2023\n\nGo back to the old Marca . com/en\n\nAfter the new English site was launched it has become terrible. I used to go directly in to soccer news to read the latest articles but now I find the same old ones at the top of the page day in and day out. What happened? Go back to the old format!\n\nDate of experience : September 30, 2022"
