        "text": "Rafa Benitez is happy in Italy. His challenge is to develop a club with improved structure and with a more European style, but without ignoring weapons like the counter. We were received at the hotel where he currently resides, where you can see the Napoli training ground where they exercise every day. A chat purely about football.\n\nQ. I was with you in Liverpool and Chelsea, but I feel that this challenge is greater just by the different structure of this club.\n\nA. Yes, clearly there is a difference with respect to the two English clubs, which are already highly organized structures. They have nothing to do with this Naples, who has completed a very rapid and dramatic journey from Serie C1 [Segunda B in Spain] until now. In just a few years the company has brought the level of old, with proper financial balance, no debt, and that is a tremendous effort and long, to reach today's position. It still has a way to go but it has gone far and well.\n\nQ. Would winning a title would be a feat similar to that achieved in Valencia?\n\nA. No, Valencia was a club with a defined structure; it had a big stadium; a good sports city and organization that matured over the years. The difference with Napoli is the stadium is owned by the City Council so improving it is not up to Napoli but the city, so the room for improvement is narrow, for now. So in structure similar clubs not really, but I agree that as to the attainment of accomplishments it could resemble Valencia. Therefore it could be more rewarding here, as it was in Valencia.\n\nQ. Here you want to make holy and almost without landing. Do not afraid of this hobby extremism? The all or nothing it is facing.\n\nA. I try to maintain balance. I put across messages in which I praise the support when things are going well, but again the important thing is also to breath when they go wrong as well. I insist on that balance enough.\n\nQ. You are known as a tactical coach, what has this brought to Italian football?\n\nA. I was at Inter and that has taught me much. Earlier in my training I traveled to Italy to learn different systems and soak it all in. Here, in three straight games you can play against a 4-3-3 system, then against a 3-5-2 a 4-4-1 or 5-3-2. In the first four days we saw all possible opposing systems. That, from the point of view of the coach is forcing you to work harder but it also enriches you.\n\nQ. In some of your previous interviews you have often stressed that possession of the ball cannot be an obsession, even though the great results that Barcelona in Spain have had. Is Napoli preparing to keep the ball or to play a passing game?\n\nA. Is clear. Napoli before my tenure was based on the counterattack, working for Cavani. It was clear. Now in Napoli we have begun to have a lot of possession. In fact, on many days we have been the team of the Serie A with the most number of crosses. But the team is not yet finished; we are in transition between a team playing one way and the other - who now want to have possession.\n\nQ. So you want the team to have the ball?\n\nA. Then I say something else: possession is not a goal in itself - not a goal at all, it is a way of understanding football. But I always say that between possession and direct play there are many nuances, a long journey. And that journey is one that has to give balance and building a team that is able to hold the ball when they have it or to play on the counter when you have to.\n\nQ. For you can you have nice football without possession?\n\nA. Of course. A soccer counterattack with speed and precision is nice. I remember when I was in Spain that your collegue (RIP) Juan Manuel Gozalo expressed how nice it was to see a long ball and a good header ending in a goal. Or how nice it is a tackle, when you go down to intercept the ball. These also are nice, but there are people who like style and other people like another.\n\nQ. Simeone, being younger than you, seems to have stolen the use of 'Game to Game, which you also use. Words or a real philosophy?\n\nA. When you play two games a week is essential to think so. If not communicating that idea to the players is difficult to manage all the options and lose a game, if you think about the following, are greater. Keep this discourse is what works. If you play every three days of course.\n\nQ. Over the years, being calm is greater. I cannot imagine reprimanding a player or correcting him with anger. What is your address privately with them?\n\nA. Depends on the moment. There are games that you do not need to say much and others that you have to be more emotional and show your character.\n\nQ. Maradona is 'god' here. Who is your Maradona within the squad?\n\nA. No Maradona. He was far above the rest. We now seek a major player that can be decisive for the team. Our team is based more on the group, though there is a Higuain, for example who can be more crucial at this point. In this Napoli team, Callejón has scored six goals in the league, Hamsik also, 'Pipita' - five ... That tells you what the team is now like. Several players are fundamental in attack and others in defense.\n\nQ. You cannot deny that you were surprised with so many goals of Callejón\n\nA. I knew the player and knew that he had to get a chance to perform, see where he could shine more and make him understand that many of the interactions that he made were very diagonal. Now I try for him to be clear towards the goal. These are small details that you are correcting, movement between lines for example. Two or three little things have been improving. Plus he has the capacity and desire to apply these changes.\n\nQ. Is International selection a possibility?\n\nA. I do not want to put any pressure to Del Bosque, it is his job but he is a player who always going to score because he has something different from the others. There are not many players who will run to the back of the defenders as he does, having that ability to get to the back of the wings. He embroiders.\n\nQ. What would you say to those who say that Higuain is a scorer ... failing at critical moments?\n\nA. We are very happy with him, apart from his injury. Gonzalo not only score sgoals but is a forward who plays the game and makes the team play better. Always knowing what to do when he touches the ball and that helps us a lot, not only with his goals but also in the collective game of attack.\n\nQ. So what has he corrected from his previous game?\n\nA. Two or three details, nuances, to adapt to team play. Not the same play with two than with a forward. Higuain movements change according to how we play.\n\nQ. Why with you does Pepe grow?\n\nA. Pepe, with us does well because Xavi Valero, our goalkeeping coach, works well with him every day and polishes small details. He knows, moreover, that he has our full confidence. The entire surrounding environment is conducive for him.\n\nQ. Albiol is the head of your defense, no doubt.\n\nA. He is very important for this Napoli team. Raul knows what we want and he is smart to apply corrections, as we want. Assimilates and applies. Now I think he should improve his Italian to play and communicate better and progress in the performance to help his teammates.\n\nQ. Let’s share some of the \"Madridistas\" questions. Coming to Naples, A Madrid taxi driver gave me this message: \"Tell the Madrid fans Rafa will come home one day.\" What would you say to that driver?\n\nA. Always I am glad that there are people who remember me and recognize my work, but now I'm in Naples. Madrid has their coach and everyone has to concentrate on their own work.\n\nQ. Put it another way: do you think that Florentino will call for the third time, after you reject the previous two offers?\n\nA. I think only, right now I have to do well with Napoli so that things keep going well here.\n\nQ. But one 'Scudetto' open doors.\n\nA. Any title helps, certainly. After so many years the key is to continue to have the ambition to win titles and if you win them, it reinforces the idea of being competitive.\n\nQ. Ancelotti is an Italian in Madrid. You’re a Spaniard in Italy. What advice would you give when you meet tomorrow?\n\nA. Carlo is a great coach and I have a great relationship with him. I guess we will talk football and he would also offer some advice about Italy. He is very nice guy and smart enough to realize what is happening n his new environment. He does not any help, that’s for sure.\n\nQ. The last question: did you feel mistreated at Chelsea?\n\nA. No, because with the players and staff I worked with we all had a very good relationship. The Directors and staff treated me well and then there was a group of fans that could not change their opinion. They remembered the successes we had whilst at Liverpool against them, against a strong Chelsea team, so strong that it left them without the ability to forget. But this was something that could not change."
