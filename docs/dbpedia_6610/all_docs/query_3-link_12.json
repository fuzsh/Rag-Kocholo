        "text": "Christian McCaffrey may have unintentionally hinted at Brandon Aiyuk's departure from the San Francisco 49ers during a training camp interview on Tuesday.\n\nAiyuk, who has been at the center of trade rumors while seeking a contract extension, was the subject of discussion in the aforementioned interview.\n\nWhen asked about the star receiver, McCaffrey's response raised eyebrows, especially after the increased speculation about interest from both Pittsburgh and Cleveland earlier in the week.\n\n\"Obviously, as a former teammate, or teammate of his in general, or any teammate that you have, you love and respect them and want the best for them,\" McCaffrey admitted.\n\nThis slip of the tongue has fueled speculation that Aiyuk's time with the 49ers may be coming to an end in the near future, which leave the Niners without a key offensive weapon.\n\nAiyuk has been spotted on the field during training camp, though not in full pads. Earlier in August, head coach Kyle Shanahan was seen giving Aiyuk an emotional hug, which many interpreted as a farewell gesture. However, Shanahan downplayed the incident.\n\n\"It's usually how we greet each other, bro hug,\" he confirmed.\n\nWhere could Aiyuk end up?\n\nWhile it's still possible that Aiyuk could remain with the 49ers, momentum appears to be building for a potential trade.\n\nBoth the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers have shown interest, with ongoing negotiations focusing on compensation, including financial terms for Aiyuk and assets to satisfy the 49ers, who hope to be able to make another Super Bowl run this season.\n\nThe New England Patriots were once considered serious contenders but have since withdrawn from the trade discussions, with it difficult to see a package the New England club could put together which would be accepted.\n\nThe Steelers have recently reengaged in talks with the 49ers, while the Browns, long interested in Aiyuk, might consider sending Amari Cooper in return.\n\nPittsburgh have salary cap concerns though, with it unlikely they would be able to re-sign Cameron Heyward next offseason if they have a huge Aiyuk salary on their books."
