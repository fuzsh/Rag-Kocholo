        "text": "Prince William might skip a trip to Balmoral this summer to avoid Prince Andrew, according to sources. The Prince and Princess of Wales are considering visiting King Charles and Queen Camilla at Balmoral, but Prince Andrew's potential presence could change their plans.\n\nA friend of the Waleses mentioned the possibility of a trip around the \"Glorious Twelfth,\" the start of the shooting season on August 12. \"I'm sure William and Catherine will want to go up with some friends for the Glorious Twelfth, and I suspect Andrew would like to go for a few days of shooting as well,\" the friend said. \"Charles has seemed happy to allow Andrew his family days at the royal shoots and I am sure that will continue.\"\n\nHowever, sources told The Daily Beast that Prince William, 42, would likely decline to be at Balmoral at the same time as the Duke and Duchess of York. Instead, William might prefer the company of Prince Edward, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, and their children, Lady Louise and James, Earl of Wessex. William is often seen with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, showing a close relationship.\n\nWilliam prefers Edward and Anne's company over Andrew\n\nInsiders also suggested that William and Kate would rather spend time with Princess Anne than with Prince Andrew. Princess Anne, who was hospitalized last month due to a head injury at Gatcombe Park estate, could join the family at Balmoral if her doctors approve. The Prince and Princess of Wales are close to Princess Anne's children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall.\n\nThe guest list at Balmoral is often seen as an indicator of who is in favor with the King and Queen. Balmoral Castle, nestled in the Scottish Highlands, was one of Queen Elizabeth II's most beloved retreats. In September 2022, the late monarch passed away peacefully while at the castle.\n\nThe sources pointed out that the Waleses' preference for the company of Prince Edward and Sophie, along with their children, reflects their close bond. Prince William is often photographed alongside the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, highlighting the strong rapport between the families."
