You can read more about which regulations apply to your products and how to comply with them.\n\nThere are specific rules for:\n\nmedical devices\n\nconstruction products\n\nmarine equipment\n\nrail products\n\ncableways\n\ntransportable pressure equipment\n\nunmanned aircraft systems\n\nhazardous substances (RoHS).\n\necodesign\n\ncivil explosives\n\nUsing the UKCA marking in different markets\n\nSelling products in Great Britain\n\nThe UKCA marking is the conformity marking used for products being placed on the market in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). The UKCA regime has been operational since 1 January 2021 and, from this date, where a product is covered by the UKCA marking and meets the relevant requirements, you are able to place the UKCA marking on your product and then place the product on the GB market.\n\nThe UKCA marking applies to most products for which the CE marking can also be used. It also applies to aerosol dispensers and measuring container bottles, for which the reversed epsilon marking can also be used. The technical requirements (sometimes referred to as ‘essential requirements’) you must meet for the UKCA marking will depend on the product-specific legislation for your product.\n\nBy following designated standards, which the UK introduced to replace EU harmonised standards, there is a statutory ‘presumption of conformity’ that the product meets the essential requirements set out in the GB legislation that apply to that product covered by the standard.\n\nThis presumption is rebuttable and, in most cases, using designated standards is voluntary, it is just one way of showing the product meets the essential requirements. In cases where an alternative technical solution is followed, you will have to provide more details in your technical documentation explaining how your products comply with the essential requirements.\n\nFor further information, read the guidance on placing manufactured products on the market in Great Britain.\n\nSelling products in Northern Ireland\n\nDifferent rules apply in Northern Ireland.\n\nFor products that can use a UKCA marking in Great Britain, these must meet EU rules in Northern Ireland, including a CE marking. Find out more about placing products on the Northern Ireland market.\n\nYou can also read guidance about the special rules around Northern Ireland qualifying goods.\n\nSelling products in the EU\n\nThe UKCA marking is not recognised on the EU market. Many products need a CE marking to show that they are in conformity with EU rules before they can be supplied on the EU market.\n\nFind out how to use the CE marking.\n\nAccepted markings on each market\n\nYou can check the table below to see which product markings can be used for goods sold on each relevant market under these rules. Please ensure you check the regulations that have specific rules outlined above.\n\nPlacing goods on the market in Great Britain or Europe\n\nType of product Accepted markings or combination of markings Manufactured products being placed on the GB market UKCA or CE Manufactured products being placed on EU market CE\n\nPlacing qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the market in Great Britain (unfettered access)\n\nType of good (see list of product areas at the end of this guidance) Accepted markings or combination of markings Qualifying Northern Ireland products being placed on the GB market under unfettered access CE; or CE and UKNI\n\nRead more about unfettered access.\n\nFor the purposes of this table, references to the CE marking may mean that other EU conformity markings apply, if relevant to your product or sector. You can read further information on product markings.\n\nFor most manufactured goods, this is the CE marking, but there are some other markings for certain products. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nthe inverted epsilon “3” (for example, for aerosols)\n\nthe Pi (π) mark (for example, some transportable pressure equipment)\n\nthe wheelmark (for example, ship parts)\n\nPlease consult the sector specific legislation that applies to your products for more information.\n\nUKCA labelling easement\n\nLegislation is now in force which enables the UKCA marking to be placed on a label affixed to the product or on a document accompanying the product until 11pm on 31 December 2027. This measure applies to the following regulations:\n\nAerosol Dispensers Regulations 2009\n\nElectrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016\n\nElectromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2016\n\nExplosives Regulations 2014\n\nEquipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2016\n\nLifts Regulations 2016\n\nMeasuring Container Bottles (EEC Requirements) Regulations 1977\n\nMeasuring Instruments Regulations 2016\n\nNoise Emission in the Environment by Equipment for use Outdoors Regulations 2001\n\nNon-automatic Weighing Instruments Regulations 2016\n\nPyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015\n\nRadio Equipment Regulations 2017\n\nRecreational Craft Regulations 2017\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/425 and the Personal Protective Equipment (Enforcement) Regulations 2018\n\nSimple Pressure Vessels (Safety) Regulations 2016\n\nSupply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008\n\nThe Pressure Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016\n\nThe Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2012\n\nToys (Safety) Regulations 2011\n\nThere are specific rules for medical devices, construction products, marine equipment, rail products, cableways, transportable pressure equipment and unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nHow to use the UKCA marking\n\nWhere to place the UKCA marking\n\nLegislation is now in force which enables the UKCA marking to be placed on a label affixed to the product or on a document accompanying the product until 11pm on 31 December 2027. This means that as of 1 January 2028, in most cases, you must affix the UKCA marking to the product itself or to the packaging. The government intends to introduce legislation to allow the UKCA marking to be affixed in more flexible ways. Additional details for this measure will be provided in due course, including which regulations it will apply to.\n\nIn some cases, for example, where the product is too small, the UKCA marking can be affixed to the data plate, packaging, a label affixed to the product or accompanying documentation. Please consult the sector-specific legislation that applies to your products for more information.\n\nThe UKCA marking must be clearly visible, legible and indelible when you affix it to the product (or permitted alternatives). There are also rules about the size and dimensions of the UKCA marking. See the rules for using the UKCA image.\n\nUKCA markings must only be placed on a product by you as the manufacturer, your authorised representative (where permitted in the relevant legislation), or if you are marketing the products under your name or trademark (for example, where you will take the responsibilities of the manufacturer, including affixing the UKCA marking).\n\nWhen affixing the UKCA marking, you take full responsibility for conformity with the requirements of the relevant UK legislation.\n\nYou must not place any marking, sign or inscription which is likely to mislead any other person as to the meaning or form of the UKCA marking or affix any marking which would impair the visibility, legibility and meaning of the UKCA marking.\n\nThe UKCA marking cannot be placed on products unless there is a specific requirement to do so in the legislation.\n\nA product may have additional markings and marks, as long as they:\n\nfulfil a different function from that of the UKCA marking or other recognised conformity markings (where permitted)\n\nare not likely to cause confusion with the UKCA marking or other recognised conformity markings (where permitted)\n\ndo not reduce the legibility and visibility of the UKCA marking or other recognised conformity markings (where permitted)\n\nBoth the CE and UKCA markings can be placed on a product so long as the relevant (EU or GB, respectively) rules are met, neither prevents the other being clearly seen and the requirements of both EU and GB legislation are met.\n\nAccompanying documents\n\nWhat form your accompanying document should take and how long it needs to be kept for depends on the product’s specific circumstances. For example, if a product is transferred in the course of a commercial activity (in a business-to-business or business-to-consumer transaction), the business supplying the product will be obliged to verify that the product bears the UKCA marking, in accordance with the relevant legislation.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the manufacturer to ensure that the technical documentation and other records relating to conformity assessment procedures are prepared in (or translated to) English regardless of whether the product is UKCA or CE marked. They must also provide the following (in English) with the product itself or as a batch:\n\nthe UKCA marking (if legislation permits the marking to be on an accompanying document)\n\nthe UK Declaration of Conformity, if UKCA marking the product\n\nthe EU Declaration of Conformity, if CE marking the product\n\nall relevant product instructions and safety information as the legislation requires\n\nIt is the responsibility of the importer to ensure the manufacturer has:\n\ndrawn up the relevant technical documentation and instructions for use in English\n\naffixed the relevant conformity marking\n\nfulfilled their identification obligations of including their name and address in line with relevant guidelines\n\nEach individual product will not necessarily need an accompanying document if moving through the supply chain as a batch. For example, when 1,000 units are moving from distributor A to distributor B, one accompanying document should be sufficient if the information that must accompany the UKCA marking applies to all the units.\n\nHowever, if distributor B were to then break the units up and supply them to separate distributors C, D, and E, each of these batches would need to be accompanied by the documents outlined above. This principle continues to apply as the units move through the supply chain towards the end user.\n\nBefore making a product available, to another distributor or to an end user, the distributor must ensure that:\n\neach product is marked with the UKCA marking (or the UKCA marking is on a label or document accompanying the product, where permitted)\n\nthe manufacturer and importer have complied with their duties to label the product with their name and contact details\n\ninstructions and safety information accompany the product, and they must be in clear, legible and easily understandable English\n\nRules for using the UKCA image\n\nYou must make sure that:\n\nif you reduce or enlarge the size of your marking, the letters forming the UKCA marking must be in proportion to the version set out below\n\nthe UKCA marking is at least 5mm in height unless a different minimum dimension is specified in the relevant legislation\n\nthe UKCA marking is easily visible, legible and indelible"
