        "text": "LOS ANGELES (Aug. 1, 2024) – The GR Corolla has expanded the fun quotient. Now both hardcore enthusiasts who enjoy the thrill of a manual transmission and those who’d rather focus on the handling can enjoy the thrill of sports car driving with the new addition of the 8-speed GAZOO Racing Direct Automatic Transmission (DAT) with paddle shifters.\n\nJust shortly after the reveal of the GR Corolla in 2022, MORIZO, Akio Toyoda, challenged his team to think about what’s next. Creating ever better cars is in Toyota GAZOO Racing’s DNA. MORIZO challenged them to pursue untamed energy, and from there we have the first GR Corolla with the new DAT.\n\nInspired by track driving, the GR Corolla has been tested by rally and racing drivers on some of the most rigorous courses the world has to offer, including Fuji International Speedway. Through their development efforts, the GR team increased engine torque on the GR Corolla from 273 lb.-ft. to 295 lb.-ft. and enhanced suspension components and tuning resulting in a vehicle that is sure to impress.\n\nChanges have also been made both inside and out to improve the driving experience. On the exterior, the front bumper has been redesigned to accommodate optional cooling components while simultaneously retaining aerodynamic performance. On the inside, there is a new dark sporty vibe due to the new trim finishes on flat surfaces and switches throughout the vehicle to provide a pleasing tactile feel.\n\nCustomers can expect new GR Corolla models to arrive at Toyota dealerships this Winter. Additional details and pricing will be shared later this year.\n\nGAZOO Racing Direct Automatic Transmission\n\nThe 8-speed GAZOO Racing Direct Automatic Transmission (DAT) is a sports car enthusiast’s dream offering quick shifting performance and optimal gear selection. The DAT control software has been optimized for sporty driving. Different than the GR Supra and GR86 automatic transmissions where gear shifting relies on sensing vehicle behavior, such as deceleration g-force and speed – the DAT’s optimized software delicately senses the way the driver steps on the brakes and operates the accelerator. With these inputs, it anticipates when gear shifting is optimal even before changes in vehicle behavior occur, achieving gear selection that reflects the driver’s intentions and, thus, leads to shifting that is similar to that of professional drivers.\n\nThe DAT also allows drivers to focus more on acceleration/brake and steering maneuvers, so non-professional drivers may be able to drive faster if they decide to hit the track. As a result, it opens up possibilities for a wider range of drivers to enjoy sports driving.\n\nThe Toyota GR development team used circuit and rally driving courses as a basis for setting the DAT’s close gear ratio. They optimized the shift points of the DAT, giving similar ratios to the 6MT that maximize delivery of engine power and torque to the wheels and enables optimal performance. Even casual highway driving has an energetic feel, due to the eight-speed transmission optimizing RPMs while at cruising speeds.\n\nThere are four drive modes on the GR Corolla: Sport, Normal, ECO and Custom. The DAT was tuned specifically for the Sport drive mode. It was tested and driven all over the world, including race circuits to ensure exciting performance and maximize the driving potential.\n\nHigh Power and Dynamic Traction\n\nFor 2025, all GR Corolla models are powered by the turbocharged G16E-GTS 1.6 liter 3-cylinder turbo engine. The high-power engine outputs 300 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 295 lb.-ft. of torque, an increase in torque from the previous model year.\n\nTo keep the higher engine output and DAT at an optimal temperature for performance, an automatic transmission fluid cooler comes standard on DAT vehicles. For drivers who may be interested in even greater cooling capability, a sub-radiator is available as a factory-installed option on the Premium grade and standard on the new Premium Plus Grade.\n\nAlways searching for ways to improve, the GR team tested the GR Corolla with the same approach used when developing a race car for the Super Taikyu (also known as the Japanese Endurance Race). During testing on the Fuji International Speedway, the engineers wanted to improve traction during hard cornering, so they added rebound springs to the front and rear suspension to suppress inner wheel lift during energetic dynamic driving. The rear coils and stabilizers were also improved to help boost ground contact response and controllability when turning.\n\nThe trailing arm mounting point, which is the rotation center of the rear axle, has been raised to reduce rear squat during acceleration. This has reduced the change of vehicle posture, enhancing the drive force response when the accelerator is pressed. It also enables a stable cornering posture.\n\nAt the heart of the GR Corolla is the rally racing developed GR-FOUR All-Wheel-Drive system. Developed in collaboration with the TOYOTA GAZOO Racing World Rally Team, it delivers exceptional levels of traction and control by optimizing drive power to each wheel. With the twist of a dial, the driver can select Normal, Gravel or Track AWD modes to adjust front/rear wheel torque distribution. Normal mode adjusts the front/rear torque distribution to 60:40 for everyday driving. Gravel adjusts the distribution to 50:50 to help deliver maximum traction. Track mode adjusts distribution by continuously varying the drive force distribution from front-focused 60:40 to rear-focused 30:70 based on the driver’s input and vehicle status.\n\nFront and rear Torsen® Limited-Slip Rear Differentials (LSD) will be standard on the 2025 Toyota GR Corolla. It offers enhanced cornering performance and grip with control of left and right-hand drive torque distribution on the front and rear axles. Launch control* has also been adopted for 2025 on DAT models, helping to enable a powerful acceleration off the line.\n\n*Launch Control is not intended for use on public roads or for repeated short interval use. See Owner’s Manual for limitations.\n\nHot Hatch Good Looks\n\nThe new GR Corolla has received a front bumper redesign to help improve the balance of cooling and aerodynamic performance. This redesign makes room for a radiator, intercooler, brake ducts, an available sub-radiator, and an available automatic transmission fluid cooler behind the front bumper.\n\nThe brake ducts have been improved so that air is drawn in more effectively. An air curtain construction has been adopted which creates an inward airflow at the top of the tire to draw in air flowing from the front along the side. Turbulence around the tire is suppressed so that the air flows smoothly rearward, contributing to enhanced handling stability. Also to help with cooling, a sub-radiator is a new available option in 2025 to help the engine cooling performance, extending the time that the vehicle can be continuously driven.\n\nFor model year 2025, the GR Corolla will be available in three grades: the well-equipped Core Grade, the impressive Premium Grade and the aggressive, new for MY2025, Premium Plus Grade. Built on the TNGA-C platform, the GR Corolla has a low center of gravity with wide tread tires mounted to cast alloy 18-inch wheels on the Core and Premium grades and 18-inch matte black wheels on the Premium Plus. All GR Corolla models wear Michelin® Pilot Sport® 4 tires 235/40R18.\n\nThe new Premium Plus grade adds standard features that enthusiasts have come to know and love on previous special editions like the carbon fiber roof, the beloved vented bulge hood and matte black wheels.\n\nExterior color options include Black, Ice Cap, Heavy Metal** and Supersonic Red.\n\n**Premium Paint Color\n\nImpressive Connected Technology\n\nBehind the GR Corolla’s steering wheel is an eight-inch digital gauge cluster with customizable settings, and in the center of the dash is the Toyota Audio Multimedia system with an eight-inch touchscreen. The Toyota Audio Multimedia system offers a user experience with sight, touch, and voice activation. With Intelligent Assistant available through Drive Connect***, simple phrases like “Hey Toyota” awakens the system for voice-activated commands to search for directions, find POIs, adjust audio controls, change the cabin temperatures and more.\n\nThe cloud-based native navigation system offered through Drive Connect allows for real-time Over the Air updates for mapping and Points of Interest (POI), and Google POI data is integrated to ensure up-to-date search capability. It also supports standard wireless Apple CarPlay® and wireless Android AutoTM compatibility.\n\nToyota Audio Multimedia allows for simultaneous dual Bluetooth® phone connectivity. A Wi-Fi Connect*** subscription or trial offers 4G connectivity for up to five devices by turning the GR Corolla into an AT&T Hotspot*, and it also offers the ability to link your separate Apple Music® and Amazon Music subscriptions to your vehicle with Integrated Streaming.\n\nThe GR Corolla also offers a host of additional Connected Services. A Safety Connect*** trial of up to 10 years includes an Emergency Assistance Button (SOS), 24/7 Enhanced Roadside Assistance, Automatic Collision Notification and Stolen Vehicle Locator. A Service Connect* trial of up to 10 years provides drivers with the capability of receiving Vehicle Health Reports, Maintenance Alerts and reminders.\n\nAll grades include a 1-year trial for Remote Connect*** which provides remote door unlock capability, vehicle status notifications, a guest driver monitor and remote start on DAT models.\n\n***4G Network-dependent.\n\nSafety & Tech\n\nThe GR Corolla comes with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 (TSS 3.0) standard.
