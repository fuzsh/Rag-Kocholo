        "text": "The first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals is scheduled to be played on Tuesday and Wednesday, and although there is no reason to panic, the Islamic State indeed made a real threat that they will act violently.\n\nWhat was the terrorist message?\n\nThe Islamic State, through its foundation Al Azaim, has spread a post on social media that threatened the soccer stadiums of London, Paris, and Madrid. The truth is that the police are always aware of this possibility, even before the threat is made public in the last few hours. The Islamic State has made it clear on several occasions that they are targeting what they call 'soft targets, such as major sporting events.\n\nThe cryptic image of a terrorist standing in front of an image of the 4 stadiums with an AK-47 posted behind a message that says \"Kill them All\" quickly became viral on X.\n\nNothing has changed at the moment, but they are proceeding with utmost care with special surveillance measures as it is considered a high-risk match by the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe government delegation is already aware of the threat, but it will not be until Tuesday morning, at the security meeting of the match, when they will decide whether to take extra security measures or not.\n\nTwo matches in 24 hours\n\nAll eyes are on Madrid as Real will meet Manchester City in the legendary Santiago Bernabeu, on Tuesday, March 9th, while Borussia Dortmund will face Atletico Madrid will clash on Wednesday, April 10th, 2024 at Estadio Metropolitan. It is not the first time that the city of Madrid has attended two consecutive home games of its teams in the Champions League."
