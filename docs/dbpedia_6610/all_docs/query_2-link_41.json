        "text": "Sports media coverage of mega-events is partly oriented to gamification, the use of game elements and game design techniques in non-gaming contexts. This infotainment approach to events has been developed by media outlets as an original and effective way to capture wider audience attention and to place events in context before a competition starts. This article examines 28 gamified sports pieces developed by media outlets from seven countries during the last two Olympics (2016 Summer Olympics in Rio and 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang) and Football World Cups (2014 in Brazil and 2018 in Russia). This sample comprises two categories following Ferrer-Conill (2015): “gamified pieces” (game like elements that are part of a bigger interactive feature) and “newsgames” (more sophisticated pieces often included in complex graphics or multimedia content). The results show that, despite its entertaining formula, gamification serves mainly informational purposes and adds value to sports co...\n\nData analysis has always been an integral part of journalism but combining it with technology was a novelty for newspapers. Journalism’s combination with technology was an innovation because of processing, interpretation, and visualization of large datasets in a journalistic content. In recent years, newspapers have started to adapt data journalism and integrated it to sports for better storytelling and making sports more understandable for readers. This research aims to analyse sports data journalism practices in Spain with a quantitative approach with content analysis of 1068 data journalism articles published by 6 newspapers (Marca, Mundo Deportivo, AS, El Mundo, El Periódico, El Pais) between 2017-2019. Quantitative analysis focuses on how sports data journalism is being adapted in Spain, technical features of articles, and the similarities and differences between sports and national newspapers to identify integration of sports data journalism.\n\nCada vez son más los medios de comunicación que recurren a elementos propios del juego para potenciar la interactividad de su producto, fomentar el consumo de contenidos informativos, destacar la publicidad o atraer a una audiencia más joven. Este trabajo pretende evidenciar los elementos y dinámicas de juego que utiliza la revista nativa digital MARCA Plus, publicación multideporte que destaca por su diseño y la adopción de narrativas audiovisuales novedosas. Los resultados muestran la presencia de estos elementos en todos los soportes en los que se ofrece, con una media de juegos por ejemplar muy reducida, asociados todos a contenidos informativos. El juego más empleado es el test deportivo y la media de lectores/usuarios jugadores supera los 200.000, de los cuales más del 60% los completa, con una duración media de más de un minuto, si bien no generan conversación posterior en Redes Sociales. It is more and more common for media outlets to draw upon elements that are traditionally found in games so as to enhance the interactivity of their product, foment the intake of their informational content, highlight their advertisements or attract a younger audience. This essay aims to present the elements and dynamics of games that are used by the digital magazine It is more and more common for media outlets to draw upon elements that are traditionally found in games so as to enhance the interactivity of their product, encourage the intake of their informational content, highlight their advertisements or attract a younger audience. The results demonstrate the presence of these gaming elements in all of the platforms in which the magazine is offered with a reduced number of games per issue and all of the games being related to the informational content.\n\nThe native digital newspaper Nexo is the empirical object of analysis of this study that aims to understand how its journalistic information is structured in terms of sections, themes, web potential, modalities, genres, and journalistic formats. The theoretical framework consists of the scenario of journalistic convergence, the structural changes and innovations associated with this convergence, and understanding the newspaper as a device, paying attention to the characteristics of cyberjournalism and how the newspaper was formed. The methodological procedures adopted are bibliographic and documentary researches and content analysis, which operationalize the evaluation of the corpus composed of materials collected in five spaces between September 11 and 24, 2017 - sections of the website, home page, Facebook page, newsletters and articles. There is a new proposal for framing sections and themes; distinct approaches to periodicity, topicality, universality and advertising; multiplatf...\n\nAbstract Introduction. This article analyses entrepreneurial journalism as a phenomenon that has emerged in Spain‟s news media industry and has developed strongly in the sports news. Method. The analysis is based on the identification and analysis of the media startups launched since 2008 and on the results of the 2013 Report of the Journalistic Profession published by the Press Association of Madrid. Results. Sports journalism is a field that favours innovation and the creation of a diversity of projects. Two tendencies stand out: hyperlocal start-ups and niche information products. Discussion. The article examines the contribution of these projects to the current structure of the journalism industry, as well as their viability, characteristic business models, and common patterns. Conclusions. Sports journalism is still at an expansive phase and involves new ways of managing internet based businesses that rely heavily on the personal brand of journalists, as well as new thematic areas and contents.\n\nThinking about the journalistic activity beyond its traditional forms is a recurrent practice in contemporary journalism. The plurality of audiences, behaviors and technologies challenge the classic models of journalism in a way that encourages innovation in different aspects of the activity. However, the term innovation is being broadly applied without rigorous and interesting delimitation to the academic environment. In this sense, we propose in this article initial directions under which aspects it is possible to understand the journalism innovation. It starts from the original concept in the field of Economics and Management to expand its meaning to the Social Sciences and Journalism. We expose three instances in which contemporary journalism already has changes, to understand the journalism as a process and product, which are: 1) content and narrative, 2) technology and format and 3) business model. In addition to this segmentation, some initiatives are presented to illustrate ..."
