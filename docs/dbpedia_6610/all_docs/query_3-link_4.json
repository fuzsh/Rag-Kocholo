        "text": "It's been a rough week for American politics since the assasination attempt on former president Doland Trump last Saturday. Multiple different fronts remain open and the Democrats are also dealing with their own significant issues. President Joe Biden just got infected with Covid-19 and the initial reports confirmed he will continue his duties in isolation from his home in Vermont. But a new development just came from right-wing media outlet NewsMax, one of the most extreme conservative outlets there are. Although they are not considered mainstream, it is one of the most influential in the circuit. Well, they are the ones reporting that the president has already decided to step down from the presidential election race.\n\nWho could take President Joe Biden's ticket?\n\nAccording to the outlet, the president is set to continue his duties until his term is over but he succumbed to pressure from high ranking democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and others. They also claim he refused to endorse vicepresident Kamala Harris as the one who will take his place in the presidential election. None of this has been confirmed by any mainstream media outlet, which is why we need to thread carefully and treat this only as a report from independent conservative media. If this is true, we should have confirmation sometime over the next 48 hours. If not, then NewsMax is risking ridicule. But let us also look at the evidence.\n\nAlthough mainstream media outlets haven't confirmed this report from NewsMax, they have been banging that drumb of President Joe Biden stepping down. They have presented scenarios and even potential replacements where Kamala Harris appears as the most obvious choice. Other names that have floated around are California Governor Gavin Newsome, and even Michelle Obama has been named amongst the potential replacements. However, the former First Lady publicly stated that running for office is not within her plans. As soon as we get further confirmation, we will report on it. But for the time being, this has to be treated as an unconfirmed report. Especially considering the media outlet that is reporting it."
