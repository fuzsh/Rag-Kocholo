        "text": "On Thursday, June 20, summer will begin, which means that on that day we will experience the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere of the planet, and the shortest day for the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe summer solstice is the day when the sun reaches the northernmost point in the sky, and the northern side of the planet experiences the longest days with natural light, and even, in some places like the Arctic Circle, there is the phenomenon of the midnight sun, where the sun remains visible throughout the night.\n\nWhat is the summer solstice?\n\nThe summer solstice marks the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere, and occurs due to the Earth's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun, which translates into the northern hemisphere being directly toward the sun, helping to maximize the length of daylight hours.\n\nAt its peak during the summer solstice, the sun reaches its highest point in the sky at solar noon.\n\nThe summer solstice will begin on Thursday, June 20 at 5:18 a.m. Pacific time in the United States, and will end at 7:39 p.m., which means that sunlight will last 14 hours and 21 minutes on that day, while the peak of the solstice will begin at 1:50 p.m.\n\nAfter Thursday, the reduction of the day will gradually decreas, although for a few seconds.\n\nDuring July and August the daylight reduction is much more reduced by decreasing by a few minutes.\n\nAs we begin to approach the autumnal equinox at the end of September, daylight will continue its reduction until daylight and night light are almost equal.\n\nWhat does the summer solstice mean spiritually?\n\nThe summer solstice symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness.\n\nThe abundance of sunlight is often seen as a metaphor for enlightenment and spiritual awareness, leading to celebrations that honor the vitality and life-giving energy of the sun."
