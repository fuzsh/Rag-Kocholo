(NASDAQ:GAME), (\"GameSquare\", or the \"Company\"), today announced that it has signed multiple new brand partnerships. Zoned expects these new projects will generate over $3 million in revenue.\n\nNew projects include marketing campaigns for renowned brands such as Topgolf and DairyMax, as well as multiple, soon-to-be announced, projects with leading global sports, media, and entertainment companies. Accelerating deal momentum reflects several organizational changes at Zoned, including the promotion of Carlos Tovar as President, continued growth of UEFN campaigns, a revitalized go to market strategy that now includes media buying for full-service marketing capabilities, and the growing benefits of GameSquare's next generation media platform.\n\n\"Zoned is an important component of GameSquare's business model, with strong levels of profitability. Since taking over as President in April 2024, Carlos has done a tremendous job revitalizing the organization to attract new global brand partners,\" said Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare. \"Zoned has created a proven model that offers a unique and differentiated platform for brands as they look for partners to help them engage with hard-to-reach audiences.\"\n\n\"Over the past several months, Zoned has dedicated significant efforts to optimizing and enhancing its go-to-market strategy. As a result, we have built a stronger organization equipped with a leading infrastructure, specifically tailored to assist brands in navigating the increasingly complex marketing landscape, particularly as they look for ways to reach youth audiences. In addition, as part of GameSquare we have the full resources of the Company's technology platform, and owned and operated IP to enhance the value we provide our global brand partners,\" said Carlos Tovar, President of Zoned.\n\nAbout GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n\nGameSquare's (NASDAQ:GAME) mission is to revolutionize the way brands and game publishers connect with hard-to-reach Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Millennial audiences.
