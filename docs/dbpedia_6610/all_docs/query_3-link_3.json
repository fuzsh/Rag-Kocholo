        "text": "With the rise of streaming services and an increase in cable-cutting, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver envisions a new future for how people are going to consume NBA content.\n\nStarting with the 2025-26 season, TNT will end its 35-year partnership with the NBA and instead move to broadcast games live on Amazon.\n\nThis is irrespective of concerns people have over stream quality when using Amazon, especially with their production of Premier League football matches.\n\nHas the Amazon deal been signed?\n\nIn a groundbreaking $76 billion deal, Amazon will pay $1.8 billion annually, while NBC will contribute $2.5 billion each year.\n\nThe situation may become complex if TNT decides to intervene, which they have five days to do following the NBA Board of Governors' approval of the deal with Bezos' company.\n\nStarting July 17, TNT can match the offers from NBC and Amazon. Reports suggest Turner Sports is considering matching Amazon's \"C package\" deal, valued at $1.88 billion.\n\nThis package would allow TNT to broadcast the In-Season Tournament, now called the Emirates Cup, which saw an 8 percent viewership increase from the previous year. The Lakers vs. Pacers game in December drew nearly 4.6 million viewers, the highest for a non-Christmas sporting event in the past five years.\n\nCould Bezos be in for a legal battle?\n\nAdam Silver has voiced concerns that TNT's involvement could lead to \"complex legal issues\" because Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns TNT, is not a streaming platform.\n\nSilver reportedly opposes TNT creating a fourth package to broadcast alternative conference finals games, as he is determined to move NBA broadcasts to streaming platforms, a league source confirmed.\n\n\"Adam 100 percent believes he's getting sued. Everybody in the NBA is preparing for a lawsuit,\" the source admitted.\n\nThe main issue with TNT matching the offer is its capability to broadcast games instead of streaming them. TNT, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, lacks the subscription numbers to compete with Amazon, which has over 170 million subscribers in the USA alone as of 2023.\n\nIf TNT matches Amazon's bid, it could hinder the NBA's strategic shift to streaming platforms from the 2025-26 season.\n\nCharles Barkley, who confirmed he will retire from his analyst role after the next season, expressed mixed feelings on the outcome."
