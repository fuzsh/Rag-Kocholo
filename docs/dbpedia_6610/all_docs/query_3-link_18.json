        "text": "Florida International University announced what could end up being a 10-year deal with international recording artist, Grammy winner and entrepreneur Armando Christian Perez, the Miami native better known as Pitbull.\n\nHe will put his name on its on-campus stadium, home of the FIU Panthers, which will now be called Pitbull Stadium.\n\nPerez will pay $1.2 million annually for the next five years, the university said, for the naming rights. He will have an option in August 2029 to extend the agreement for another five years and continue the rebranding.\n\n\"Yes, we're going to create history at Pitbull Stadium,\" Pitbull said during a news conference in Miami. \"This is not just an announcement. It's a movement. It's really a historic event.\"\n\nPitbull, a pioneer in stadium naming\n\nFIU said it is the first deal in which an artist owns the naming rights to a stadium. Pitbull will also participate in FIU's naming, image and likeness efforts, said athletic director Scott Carr.\n\n\"This is a historic day for FIU athletics to partner in a unique way with a world-renowned artist and an incredible person who truly values relationships and his community,\" Carr said.\n\n\"Armando's financial support is a game changer, but having him provide a microphone to amplify FIU will be even more beneficial to the growth of our brand.\"\n\nAs part of the agreement, Perez gets the use of the stadium for 10 days a year rent-free, and some tickets for those events will be reserved for FIU students.\n\nA vodka brand he owns will be a preferred brand at the stadium in the future, he will receive the use of two suites and 20 VIP parking passes for FIU home soccer games, and he has been asked to create an \"FIU Anthem\" to be played at the school's athletic competitions.\n\nPitbull, also known as \"Mr. 305,\" a nod to Miami's area code, began his music career in the South Florida rap scene around 2004, eventually becoming one of the most recognized artists in the world.\n\n\"Pitbull's career trajectory reflects FIU's rise as one of the nation's top public research universities,\" said FIU President Kenneth A. Jessell. \"Like FIU, he started out very 305 and grew into a global university.\"\n\nPerez has been a longtime advocate for supporting education in South Florida. FIU said he founded the first free public charter school SLAM! (Leadership, Arts and Sports Management) in Miami in 2012.\n\n\"It's about bringing everyone together,\" he said. \"It's about bringing everyone together. ... Hard work is what pays off. They tell me, 'You're so lucky.' Well, the harder I work, the luckier I get.\""
