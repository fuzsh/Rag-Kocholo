        "text": "England are still alive in Euro 2024, for the moment. Gareth Southgate's men overcame their worst form to reach the quarter-finals of the European Championship after a 95th-minute Jude Bellingham strike that took the game into extra time.\n\nHowever, after qualifying to face Switzerland in the next round, the England team could suffer a blow as their star player could be banned for his gestures in Gelsenkirchen.\n\n\"A UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspectorate will conduct a disciplinary investigation into a possible breach of the basic rules of decent conduct by England player Jude Bellingham, alleged to have occurred in the context of this match,\" a statement said. The England player scored the equaliser in the final minute of stoppage time and made a movement, allegedly touching his privates, towards rival substitutes in the dugout area. The cameras panned to Bellingham as he returned to the pitch with Harry Kane after the celebration and that is when all the controversy erupted.\n\nThe gesture, possible sanction and Jude's response\n\nThe England No.10 kissed his right hand and then moved it to his private parts. Although the gesture was not recorded by referee Halil Umut Meler, the England player is at risk of being sanctioned by UEFA for the gesture as he could face disciplinary action from European football's governing body.\n\n\"An inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how that Slovakia team played tonight,\" Bellingham defender on X.\n\nBut the rules are clear: \"Any obscene gesture or offensive or insulting action must be punished with a red card.\" And the same source adds that \"UEFA's disciplinary body will await reports from the match referee and other officials before deciding on any possible action,\" they say. UEFA understands that there could have been contempt from the English player to the opposition, something that the Real Madrid player strongly denies and that will have to be analysed to determine if there is a sanction or not."
