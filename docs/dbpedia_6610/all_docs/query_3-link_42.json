        "text": "In recent years, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have experienced a significant shift in their relationships within the British Royal Family.\n\nA once close bond with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie has reportedly become strained, with a noticeable distance forming between the Sussexes and the York sisters.\n\nSources indicate that a combination of public disputes and security concerns preventing private visits to England has contributed to this growing rift.\n\nAccording to a source speaking to The Express, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have reaffirmed their commitment to the Royal Family, creating a divide from Prince Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"Beatrice and Eugenie have firmly pledged their allegiance to the Royal Family,\" the source revealed. \"They haven't communicated with the Sussexes for quite a while now. They are nowhere near as close as they once were.\"\n\nThe tension between the families reportedly intensified following remarks by the princesses' mother, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph from March 2023, Ferguson claimed she \"doesn't really know Meghan\" and had not met her extensively.\n\nThis statement contradicted the Sussexes' previous claims that Ferguson had taught Meghan how to curtsey to the late Queen, sparking confusion and disappointment from Harry and Meghan.\n\nThe source elaborated on the impact of Ferguson's comments, stating, \"Sarah taught Meghan how to curtsey, and there have been other meetings.\n\nBoth Harry and Meghan were quite surprised by Sarah's comments and couldn't understand why she would distance herself like that. It has caused a bit of distance between the families.\"\n\nClose Bonds Unravelling\n\nHistorically, Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, maintained a close relationship with Harry and Meghan.\n\nEugenie shares a strong bond with her cousin Prince William, and Jack was known for his camaraderie with Harry. However, recent developments have affected these relationships as well.\n\n\"Eugenie and Jack are very careful about what they say to friends because they don't want to be seen as bad-mouthing Harry or Meghan,\" the source mentioned.\n\n\"There's still a friendship there, but it's not like the close family bond they had before Harry moved to America.\"\n\nAs the dynamics within the royal family continue to evolve, the once-tight-knit relationships between the Sussexes and the York sisters have undeniably changed.\n\nWhile a semblance of friendship remains, the deep familial connections have become more distant, reflective of the broader shifts within the British Royal Family."
