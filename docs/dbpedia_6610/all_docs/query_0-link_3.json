        "text": "Freedom of the press or freedom of expression have become basic points of democratic development in modern societies. The Spanish Constitution of 1812 already enshrined this right: \"All Spaniards are free to write, print and publish their political ideas without the need for any licence, revision or approval prior to publication, subject to the restrictions and responsibility established by law\".\n\nWhile everything that is published, except that which directly incurs crimes such as slander and libel, must be defended according to the principles of freedom of the press, not everything that is published is journalism. The exercise of journalism is distinguished not only by freedom, but also by a civil morality, a sense of responsibility that has not always reigned in the media.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution, in force since 1978, makes it clear that freedom of expression is one of the basic points of our legal system, as stated in article 20:\n\n1. Rights are recognised and protected:\n\na) To freely express and disseminate thoughts, ideas and opinions by word, writing or any other means of production.\n\nb) To literary, artistic, scientific and technical production and creation.\n\nc) To academic freedom.\n\nd) To freely communicate or obtain truthful information by any means of dissemination. The law shall regulate the right to a clause of conscience and professional secrecy in the exercise of these freedoms.\n\n2. The exercise of these rights may not be limited by any form of prior censorship.\n\n3. The law shall regulate the organisation and parliamentary control of the mass media dependent on the State or any public entity and shall guarantee access to these services for significant social and political groups, respecting the pluralism of society and the different languages of Spain.\n\n4. These freedoms shall be limited in respect for the rights recognised in this Title, in the precepts of the laws implementing it and, in particular, in the right to honour, privacy, personal image and the protection of minors and children.\n\n5. The seizure of any publication, recordings and other means of information may only be ordered by virtue of a judicial decision.\n\nThe attribution of the news to defined sources gives it a special value: any information where the source is identified gains credibility in the eyes of readers. For this reason, every effort must be made to identify the source, so that the reader does not get a feeling that the journalist is being too clever, is making up what he or she is reporting, or is in possession of divine knowledge.\n\nThe task of attribution is never easy because it clashes with the right and duty of confidentiality to protect sources who wish to remain anonymous, a right guaranteed by the Spanish Constitution (art. 20). This professional confidentiality is exercised by the journalist, but it is the source and, ultimately, society as a whole that is protected. This problem is exacerbated in the Spanish context because there are numerous sources who feel sufficiently unprotected as to demand anonymity.\n\nWhat is the solution? There is no single remedy, but two options that should be pursued in each case are as follows:\n\n1. Search for corroborating sources. Once a key piece of information has been obtained from a source that has requested confidentiality, other sources can be sought to confirm it and can be identified. This is probably more likely to be done through documented sources than human sources, but the journalist should not rule out finding the latter.\n\n2. The need for more precise attribution. It is often possible, even in the case of a source who demands confidentiality, to agree with the source to be identified, if not completely, then with a degree of detail, which will help to reinforce the credibility of the information in the eyes of the reader."
