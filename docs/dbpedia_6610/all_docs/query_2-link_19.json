        "text": "When most people think of brand promotion, they think of magazine ads, television commercials, and the web. We think it is anything that makes our clients famous. That is our job. And we develop creative content that makes that happen. Then we think of ways to distribute that creative content. It might be through an online film, an event on the street, a book or something we have not yet imagined. Every person at Marca and every client we have needs to be aware that while traditional advertising is important and will get done, what's arguably more important is the stuff that orbits around the traditional stuff. Like the message on the company voicemail. The T-shirt we hand out to every employee. The idea for a great new product. The coffee mug every customer gets handed to them in gratitude for their business. The cool new web page. The letter to every member of Congress petitioning for a new national holiday. This is how brands are built. To us, it's all brand promotion. So now when you read the term, \"brand promotion\" in our website...you know what we mean. Very simply, we feel that the experience of our team - from tactical (design, copy writing, campaign development, digital, mobile) to operational management (entrepreneurial launches, Fortune 500 operations) make the difference. Would you rather work with a team who has DONE it before? Done it, meaning launched and operated a successful business in industries and situations like yours. We would.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.livemarca.com\n\nExternal link for Marca\n\nIndustry\n\nAdvertising Services\n\nCompany size\n\n51-200 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n1999\n\nSpecialties\n\nStrategic Marketing, Digital Planning & Execution, Branding, Mobile Marketing, Partnership Marketing, Buyer Insights, PR, Event Marketing, Social Media, Search Marketing, Campaign Dev & Execution, Advertising, Extl Communications, IT Channel Marketing, and Video Content"
