        "text": "Today we are releasing a public beta of the new NVIDIA app, the essential companion for gamers and creators with NVIDIA GPUs in their PCs and laptops. Download here. The NVIDIA app beta is a first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience, and RTX Experience apps.\n\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest NVIDIA drivers, and enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nFeaturing a unified GPU control center, NVIDIA app allows fine-tuning of game and driver settings from a single place, while introducing a redesigned in-game overlay for convenient access to powerful gameplay recording tools, performance monitoring overlays, and game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for GeForce RTX users.\n\nThis initial beta release incorporates many of the top features from our existing apps, optimizes the user experience, includes an optional login to redeem bundles and rewards, and introduces new RTX capabilities to elevate your gaming and creative experiences.\n\nWhen it comes to your favorite games or applications, Game Ready Drivers and Studio Drivers ensure the ultimate experience for gamers and creators. A popular request from GeForce Experience users is for a quicker, more straightforward way to understand what's included in the latest driver updates.\n\nIn the new Driver page, we've introduced easy-to-scan bullet points of “what’s new” and “what’s fixed,” alongside quick callouts on game support. All driver related articles are accessible on a single carousel so you can read about game announcements or technologies associated with the driver.\n\nNVIDIA Freestyle empowers you to personalize the visual aesthetics of your favorite games through real-time post-processing filters. This feature boasts compatibility with a vast library of more than 1,200 games, and now NVIDIA app offers AI-powered filters, accelerated by Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs.\n\nRTX Dynamic Vibrance is an AI-powered Freestyle filter that improves upon the beloved Digital Vibrance feature in the NVIDIA Control Panel. RTX Dynamic Vibrance enhances visual clarity on a per app basis, providing players with a flexible and convenient way to tune their visual settings for each game. Colors pop more on screen, with perfect balance to minimize color crushing, preserving image quality and immersion.\n\nRTX HDR, a new AI-powered Freestyle filter seamlessly brings the vibrant world of High Dynamic Range (HDR) to games that were not originally equipped with HDR support. Remarkably, only 10 of the top 50 most-played GeForce games offer HDR support and there are thousands of games that only support SDR. However, with the RTX HDR filter, you can now take advantage of your HDR-compatible monitor for a broad spectrum of games running on DX12, DX11, DX9, and Vulkan platforms. Check out the NVIDIA Consumer Support Knowledge Base for more details."
