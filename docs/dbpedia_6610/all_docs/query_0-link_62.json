        "text": "What I have loved the most of my decade-long tenure at Newell Brands has been the spirit of teamwork and the valuable connections I’ve made across various functions and regions. I have gained tremendous perspective and knowledge from incredible leaders and partners, alongside the global reach of our top-notch brands.\n\nLiz Rueda Fuentes\n\nSenior Program Manager, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\n\nWorking at Newell Brands has been a rewarding experience because I am surrounded by so many colleagues who take ownership of their impact on the company. With the abundance of opportunities to grow and learn, I am encouraged to be ambitious with my career and to seek advancement opportunities. At Newell, I am constantly inspired to be a better teammate, to lead with integrity and to aspire for greater because that’s what I see in everyone around me.\n\nDana Paulita Harmond\n\nManager, Corporate Strategy\n\nNewell Brands provided the jumpstart to a much-needed change in my career at a pivotal time in my life and has provided many new opportunities for me since then. People are the essential part of why I love working at Newell and they also are the center of my work. Ensuring the overall health and safety of our employees around the globe is my top priority. By nature, people all have the same aspiration no matter where they’re located, especially when it comes to safety - everyone wants safety for themselves and their families. The diversity of people, positions and functions, and countries Newell operates in gives you a glimpse into the tapestry of this incredible work family.\n\nThierry Gendre\n\nSafety Director, EMEA & APAC\n\nI joined Newell Brands in 2009 and immediately noticed that it was different than any company that I’d worked at before. This company was completely invested in the growth and success of one of its best assets - the employees. There is a strong culture of growth through training, development and creating opportunities for advancement. I love that the success that I’ve experienced at Newell is due to shared values, attitudes and behaviors with my team members, as well as the awesome leaders.\n\nCheryl Brooks\n\nSenior Coordinator, Learning & Culture\n\nI’ve worked at Newell Brands for almost 10 years, but since 2018, I’ve led Human Resources at our Acuña manufacturing site where more than 1,300 people proudly work to produce Oster® blenders. What I love the most about working here is that Newell allows high performers to achieve their career goals and passion for winning is a core value. I enjoy collaborating across different countries and regions. I love our brands and I'm proud to work in a company that really cares about their people and the communities where we operate.\n\nYazmin De la Cruz\n\nSenior Manager, Human Resources\n\nNewell is a company that you can grow with and gain experience in numerous types of positions until you find one that works best for you. I also love that Newell gives people opportunities to volunteer on employee and community committees. People at Newell are friendly, and we engage positively with one another throughout the workday. Our teams in the factory work great together. It is inspiring to work for a company that motivates teams to work hard and feel appreciated.\n\nDavid Sexton\n\nCounter Cycle, Inventory Control\n\nAfter being employed in the gaming industry for several years, I looked to make a career change in hopes of expanding my knowledge of corporate design. I was hired by Newell Brands for a three-month contract position to cover an employee out on leave. You could say things have gone well – I’m now going on almost eight years here! Our culture is different at Newell Brands. We’re given the chance to succeed. Opportunities to take ownership and present ideas are limitless, which makes working here extremely rewarding.\n\nFiona Johnson\n\nManager, Corporate Communications Design\n\nMy work at Newell Brands has enabled me to grow my specialized design skills and further my leadership abilities over the past 11 years. The best thing about my job is that I collaborate with incredibly talented people. Additionally, the company's adaptability has meant new challenges such as leading different teams, assuming various responsibilities, navigating between businesses, and tackling big challenges. I always feel like my contributions are meaningful and are connected to the company’s goals.\n\nLea Stewart\n\nSenior Manager, Industrial Design"
