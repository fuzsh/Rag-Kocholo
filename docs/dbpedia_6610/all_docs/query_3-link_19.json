Learn how fostering an environment where every employee feels valued and engaged can lead to increased innovation, improved financial performance, and a stronger company reputation. Some of their recent newsletter include the following topics.\n\nDiversity as a social and productive value\n\nDiversity in the workplace is becoming increasingly important on corporate agendas. Company leaders are embracing diversity not only as a value and a social commitment, but also as a criterion for increasing productivity and the feeling of belonging of the workforce. And the data shows this.\n\nRead the original newsletter: El valor de la diversidad\n\nInclusive communication, a commitment still in development\n\nThe commitment of companies to gender equality implies taking care of their internal and external communication. Proposing an announcement based on stereotypes or using very masculine language are two examples of bad practices that do not favor diversity and inclusion, neither of the team nor of society as a whole.\n\nRead the original newsletter: Comunicación no sexista\n\nCorporate culture, essential for attracting talent\n\nAttracting staff is becoming increasingly difficult for companies. According to Randstad Spain, one in three employees is planning to change jobs in the next six months, which is an increase compared to 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the search for new opportunities is related to the brand values ​​of each company, which can cause talent to flee or attract. According to the 2024 Remuneration Study prepared by Walters People, 89% of the professional population in Spain says that corporate culture is important when choosing a job. In fact, 13% value this criterion above flexibility or workload.\n\nRead the original newsletter: Talento y valores de marca\n\nStay Tuned"
