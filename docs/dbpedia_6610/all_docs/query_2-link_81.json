        "text": "For reasons of its own, EA SPORTS FC 25 is one of the summer's big stars. The new Electronic Arts sports simulator is showing many of its future novelties and the truth is that many of them are really striking.\n\nIt is for this reason, among others, that I am beginning to think that we could be facing the best soccer game ever. Of course, it is impossible to know before its launch, but it is true that it is already showing us very interesting features.\n\nEA SPORTS FC 25, the best soccer game ever?\n\nFor starters, it has an unavoidable advantage over previous games: technology. Although there are more than a few really good old sports simulators, advances in technology mean that these kinds of nostalgia-prompting games sometimes lose weight.\n\nElectronic Arts has given much importance to the control of the game and artificial intelligence in this new release, so we could be facing a real before and after in the industry of soccer games.\n\nBy making it possible for us to have a better management of everything that happens on the field, they could make the RNG (i.e. randomness) have less influence on the game.\n\nOf course, it is impossible to eradicate it by 100%, but if they manage to reduce its importance, we would be looking at a very noticeable change.\n\nThis could put an end to part of that annoying handicap that has often been talked about, but never fully proven. If the AI is smarter and listens to us, whether that handicap exists or not, we could deal with it better by being able to control more effectively how our players respond to certain situations.\n\nSo yes, one of the reasons I think FC 25 may be the best soccer sports sim ever is because of its new AI.\n\nUnfortunately, until I try it, I won't know if this is the case, but I think we can be optimistic in that sense. These changes come with many other new features that we have been analyzing lately: player roles, intentional fouls, new tactics, and the functioning of the AI itself.\n\nIn fact, this reminds me of the issue of FIFA bans. As we were able to learn, the highest international soccer body imposed a series of restrictions on EA when carrying the official FIFA license.\n\nIn EA FC SPORTS 24 they got rid of them, but I understand that it has been with FC 25 that they have really had time to work. Being the second installment to be released after disassociating themselves from FIFA, I understand that it is the one in which they are really being able to integrate all the changes they wanted. That includes intentional fouls, among other things.\n\nConsequently, moving away from FIFA is another reason why I think EA SPORTS FC 25 could hold the crown.\n\nOf course, these are not the only factors. Having seen some of the gameplay and new features, it can be inferred that the new FC 25 is looking to improve the movement even more. Looking at the new dribbles and how they might work, or taking a look at the new goalkeeping skills, I realize that it wants to be a deeper game.\n\nThe goalkeeper issue may seem minor, for example, but it is actually a very important change. It's almost as interesting as the fact that they're going to remove temporary contracts from FUT mode, a mechanic that almost nobody liked.\n\nWhat this tells us is that (or so it seems) they've listened to some of the most frequent complaints from the community as they work on what they see fit.\n\nAll these reasons, added to everything we already saw in EA ESPORTS FC 24 and Electronic Arts' own experience making sports video games, are what makes me think that EA SPORTS FC 25 is a candidate to be the best soccer game ever.\n\nAs I said, this is all on paper. It's a theory because we haven't been able to test all of its content yet, but it looks good. Rush mode is eye-catching, the women's leagues are getting more and more powerful. It is progressing along the right path and this makes me have faith. A lot of faith."
