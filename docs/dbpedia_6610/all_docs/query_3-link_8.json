        "text": "The relationship between brothers Prince William and Prince Harry continues to deteriorate, despite the apparent closeness they shared when they were younger.\n\nIn light of Prince Harry's continued absence in the United States of America, having abandoned his Royal duties, Prince William has reportedly banned Prince Harry from returning to the royal family \"in any way, shape, or form,\" according to an inside source.\n\nThis move aligns with William's new role as the family disciplinarian, a position previously held by the late Prince Philip.\n\nPrince William is dealing with his own personal difficulties at this juncture, as his wife Princess Kate is undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nHowever, he hasn't let that potentially introspective moment allow him to change his mind with regards to his younger brother.\n\nWhy is Prince William now the family disciplinarian?\n\nWilliam has taken on a more authoritative role within the family, as highlighted by recent claims following a YouGov poll on the most popular male royal.\n\nDescribed as ruling \"with a rod of iron,\" William's strict approach mirrors that of his late grandfather, although it's unclear if that will benefit his own children by the time they are grown up.\n\nA source told the Daily Beast intricate details of how William has moved into this role and why it continues to influence his dealing of the Harry situation.\n\n\"There is a sense that William has stepped into the Prince Philip role. Philip ruled the family with a rod of iron... Now William is calling the shots when it comes to family discipline... He can be scary,\" the source declared.\n\nThe source further noted that William's discipline includes the aforementioned ban on Prince Harry, which puts paid to any notion that Harry was set to return to the United Kingdom."
