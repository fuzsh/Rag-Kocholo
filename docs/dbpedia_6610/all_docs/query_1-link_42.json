Durante 30 aÃ±os, Sherman se ha fotografiado asimisma bajo un amplio rango de apariencias y personajes que se convierten en fascinantes e inquietantes, desagradables y conmovedores.\n\nCindy Sherman, a traveling retrospective of one of the most significant contemporary artists and arguably the most influential one working exclusively with photography.

Organized by Curator of Media Arts Rudolf Frieling, the exhibition presents works in a variety of media and features a series of performances that explore the influence of theater, dance, and performance in contemporary art.\n\nStage Presence gathered three decades of works by 40 artists including some key works from the SFMOMA media arts collection, all of which embrace theatricality in contemporary art practice. Exuberant manifestations of the âstageâ emerge, such as beauty pageants; a dance troupe in post-punk London; artists dressed as a bear and a rat walking through the Swiss Alps; and a family occupying in-store Ikea model rooms. Some of the works are humorous and camp, while others are critical and subversive.\n\nClick here to see larger images of Lee Miller's neck by Man Ray and Man Ray's portrait by Lee Miller\n\nPreviously exhibited at the Legion of Honor Museum in San Francisco.\n\nMan Ray and Lee Miller lived together in Paris from\n\n1929 to 1932, first as teacher and student, later as\n\nlovers, and finally as collaborators. Man Ray, already an established member of the French avant-garde, was a leading figure of the Surrealist movementâ the loose association of artists and writers who rose to prominence after the First World War by making provocative combinations out of ordinary things. Miller, who was just starting her career, sought out Man Ray as a mentor. Although their time together was short, the professional and personal inspiration they shared resulted in some of the most powerful work of each artistâs career.\n\nThe De Young Museum in San Francisco hosted the Renaissance Painters of Passion and Power from the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Over fifty paintings by some of the most well-known Venetian painters from the sixteenth-century including Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto, Andrea and Mantegna.
