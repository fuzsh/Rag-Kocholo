Consequently, the User must read these General Terms and Conditions attentively. In this regard, User shall be understood to mean the person who accesses, browses, uses or participates in the services and activities, whether free or paid, offered on the Website.\n\n2.3. UNIDAD EDITORIAL may also allow third parties to advertise or provide their services through its Website. In such cases, UNIDAD EDITORIAL will not be responsible for establishing the General and Specific Terms and Conditions regulating the use, provision or contracting of these third-party services and, therefore cannot be held liable for them.\n\n2.4.

The use and/or contracting of these specific services implies acceptance of the Specific Terms and Conditions that regulate them in the version published by UNIDAD EDITORIAL at the time when such use and/or contracting occurs.\n\n3.

If in order to use and/or contract a service on the Website the User is required to register, he or she (hereinafter the \"Registered User\") will be responsible for providing truthful and lawful information. If as a result of registration, the User is provided with a password, the User undertakes to use it diligently and keep the password for accessing these services secret. Consequently, Users are responsible for the proper custody and confidentiality of any identifiers and/or passwords provided by UNIDAD EDITORIAL, and undertake not to transfer their use to third parties, whether temporarily or permanently, or to allow third parties to access them. The User will be responsible for the use of the services by any illicit third party who uses a password for this purpose due to its non-diligent use or loss by the User.\n\n5.3. By virtue of the foregoing, it is the User?s obligation immediately to notify marca.com of any event that allows the improper use of identifiers and/or passwords, such as theft, loss, or unauthorised access to them, with a view to their immediate cancellation. Until such events are reported, UNIDAD EDITORIAL will be exempt from any liability that may arise from the improper use of identifiers or passwords by unauthorised third parties.\n\n5.4. Access, navigation and use of the Website is the responsibility of the User, and the User therefore undertakes diligently and faithfully to observe any additional instructions given by UNIDAD EDITORIAL or by authorised personnel of UNIDAD EDITORIAL regarding the use of the Website and its Content.

Participation Spaces and Tools\n\nRegistered User Profile\n\n6.1. The Website makes available to the User various participation spaces and tools to encourage conversation and the exchange of ideas and opinions among users. The objective is that they should remain open and accessible to anyone as long as basic rules of coexistence and respect are observed.\n\n6.2. Through these tools and spaces, Registered Users may have their own space, called Profile, which will identify them under their real name or their User identifier associated with the User account. User accounts may, if Registered Users so choose, be associated with an image (avatar) of their choice and which will represent them visually in the various participation spaces of the Website. The avatars of Users followed by the Registered User and also of those following the Registered User will be visible in the Profile so that the User can be informed and easily recognise them.\n\n6.3. The Profile will show the User?s activity on the Website. The Registered User?s comments are public and are compiled in the Profile, where they can be consulted along with the responses and mentions received from other Users. Other Users will be able to follow the Registered User?s activity on the Website, the comments and the contests and promotions in which the Registered User participates.\n\n6.4 Users will be able to follow the activity of other users of the Website that they find interesting, what they comment on and where they do so.

This Profile will be generally public but certain private activities will be kept hidden, visible only to the User (such as start of tracking, moderated Content, individual notifications of participation in promotions and games and any other private notifications).\n\nRules for Participation\n\n6.7. In no circumstances will the publication of Content that clearly promotes hatred, contempt or discrimination based on birth, race, sex, religion, nationality, opinion or any other personal or social circumstance be permitted. Nor will attempts to impersonate third parties or the publication of private contact information be tolerated in any circumstances, regardless of their purpose.\n\n6.8. Messages that contain ?spam? or those with links to sites that have nothing to do with the reason for the conversation will not be approved either.\n\n6.9 Polite messages are sought, for an exchange of opinions, so personal attacks and messages unrelated to the conversation will not be permitted.\n\n6.10 To avoid repeated comments, we recommend first reading the whole conversation before participating in it.\n\n6.11 The User is responsible for all statements on the internet just as anywhere else.\n\n6.12 User Messages do not necessarily correspond to our editorial line.\n\n6.13 The Website reserve the right to delete, for any reason and without prior notice, any information or Content generated in the participation spaces.\n\n6.14 The Website makes available a tool for reporting inappropriate messages or Content.
