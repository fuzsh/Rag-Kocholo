Partial: Pau Gasol: "Me dará rabia ver jugar a la selección y no estar allí" It will disturb me to watch the team play, and not be there. Pau Gasol (Barcelona, 1980) recibe relajado a MARCA en Benidorm, en el hotel donde están alojados los niños que participan en su campus. Explica por enésima vez su renuncia a la 'BA y admite que un gusanillo muy grande correrá por dentro de su cuerpo cuando vea a sus compañeros jugar en el Mundial de Turquía. Al mismo tiempo, piensa en la próxima temporada, en un tercer anillo y en ser un poco mejor jugador. El gigante no para de crecer. Pregunta. ¿No es paradójico que haya retomado la actividad física el día que empezó a entrenarse la selección cuando usted ha renunciado al Mundial para descansar? RESPUESTA. Es una coincidencia, sin más. Pau Gasol is relaxing at Marca in Benidorm, in the hotel where the children are staying that are participating in his basketball camp. He explains for the umpteenth time his non-participation of the Spanish National Team and admits that it will be very painful for him to watch his former team companions play in the World competition in Turkey. At the same time, he is thinking about next season, about a third ring and of becoming a better player. Question: Isn’t it curious that you returned to physical activity the same day that the National Team began to train after you refused to participate in order to rest? Response: It is just a coincidence. P. Hay aficionados, y no son pocos, que no entienden su negativa a la 'BA. ¿Cómo se lo puede explicar?

Im @ work ill try to translate more later, dont want the boss catching me doing a translation for LTB.. its not he best translation.. P. Some, with the euphoria of the world cup title in soccer, even speak of treason. R. This word is very strong, no? If it is necessary to explain it thousand times, I will do it. I resign to the World champions because It’s been a couple of years playing a lot of games That, at this point of my career it’s a lot . I was going to resign last year and in the end I did not do it. This season I had to stop after the load of all these years. It is a decision that I took with the head than more with the heart. P. are you to continue with that tone of voice during this interview? R. If you keep asking the same type of questions, yes i already answered this questions a thousand times, P. Has the Lakers pressure you so that you will not go not go to Turkey? R. Yes, the team is clear that it prefers that I rest in summer and that does not dispute any competition. In the three last years we have played the maximum of games that can be played and that takes a strong wearing down. If you can recuperate during the summer to try to confront another season with the objective to return to gain the ring, far better. “I was already going to resign in 2009, the Lakers have pressed to me to not go " P. do you think that is ok that a player resigns to the national team to rest and goes to Turkey to be a commentator for a television, in this case Sixth ?(Spanish Television) R. Yes.....
