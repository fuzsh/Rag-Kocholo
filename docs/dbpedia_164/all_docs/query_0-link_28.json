        "text": "Note\n\nProcedurally – my apologies, though not my doing, as to the ads, which suddenly appeared on my WordPress site perhaps two years ago; ideally, I’d find a site without them, but only with…unlimited time:)!\n\n*******************************************************\n\nSubstantively, and, in hopes to reach all levels of readers here, I’d say that….\n\nA tiny handful of individuals in my “friends and family” circle will be glad to dive into all that I have written here, but no doubt that is rare.\n\nWith that in mind, the core essay is pretty breezy here in my mind, while appendices, as in a January 2023 blog of mine on Oakland, may seem like Jupiter – size-wise – or at least a cottage industry, but I would encourage your consideration of them if you want to get beyond the surface (aka the museum displays pictured below), see a few more interesting photos, etc.].\n\n***********************************************************\n\nIn early March, 2023, I had a great time at the Idaho Black History Museum (IBHM) whose structure, seen below, was moved to this site from a nearby spot where it had been the historically Black St. Paul Baptist Church….\n\nMy two visits to the museum came during a short visit to Boise. [But long enough to begin to learn to ditch a “z” in saying the city’s name, as it is pronounced “BOY-see”!]\n\nIt is easily found within the city’s Julia Davis Park, neighboring its bigger cultural siblings of the Idaho State Museum and the Boise Art Museum, with the State museum seen to the left in this image of a western entry to the Park….\n\nI would guess that most people are likely to see 20-30 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to experience the museum’s narrative kiosks and display cases, with this view of early March showing maybe 70% of the one room for the museum…..\n\nIt is definitely a small cultural attraction, but one where it is easy to be exposed to big ideas and, in my case at least, different perspectives, thanks largely to Phillip Thompson….\n\n…the head of the board for the museum and its director.\n\nWhile his perspective certainly offers education on the sadness and tragedies of the past experienced by people of color, his greater emphasis is on taking advantage of opportunities today, using Idaho’s favorable story – to a very large extent as he sees it – for Blacks.\n\nI would see both of us as having a largely positive view of Black survival, and “thrival”, in our nation – of celebrating “Black Joy” (in nodding to a more common term in recent years) and Black achievement; anywhere I do that is very much thanks in large part to my parents, now deceased, working for a number of years at Karamu Theater, an interracial arts organization in Cleveland, Ohio, and people still recalling how much they enjoyed its interracialism as well as its pursuit of Black artistry.\n\nStill, I am deeply rooted in an orientation which exists much more on the left, of highlighting ongoing systemic racism, allowing at its most energetic end for campaigns such as those which seek reparations for enslavement and other pursuits which….might not be seen as right – on the Right:).\n\nI did not walk away from the museum (hereinafter referred to at times as IBHM or the BHM?) with any markedly changed views of America’s situation as to racial and social justice, but the conversations there were a reminder to listen deeply, often to things you do not want to hear, as long as you have some legitimate sense that those who voice them want constructive and respectful dialogue, whatever their positions.\n\nWhile there are a few reasons for any place evolving in its own particular way, Phillip Thompson sees an earlier decision in what was then Idaho Territory as key for everything that follows.\n\nWhen the Territory was eight years old, in 1871, it disallowed segregation in schools, as noted in what may be the second and perhaps key paragraph of this first “narrative board” which I saw at the IBHM…..\n\nThat early move echoes to this day in Mr. Thompson’s mind, when incomes for Blacks in Idaho have in recent years been…shall we say….a very unexpected percentage of White incomes in Idaho, enough that I will let readers guess that “number” and note it in an appendix to this writing.\n\nShortly after I came into the museum for my first of two visits there, I heard this statistic, and I rarely use the term “mind-blowing”, so I’ll just say…it’s halfway to mind-blowing.\n\nOnce three of us who were visiting and communicating with Mr. Thompson knew that… at least in very recent times – Black incomes in Idaho were proportionally the highest of Black incomes in any state, he went on to ask me and the two white ladies who had walked in to the display area if we could guess what state has recently had the second-highest income for Blacks, and he responded that it is Wyoming, in regards to which he said….in essence….”and you know what?”….adding that it was, like present-day Idaho, also part of “Idaho Territory” early on, as seen in the map within the board below; to be sure, Wyoming is basically the rectangle to the lower right of Idaho…..\n\nI will once again be coy and give you a chance to guess Black incomes as a percentage of white incomes in Wyoming, directing you to the same appendix if you cannot wait to pass go, or the like! [Appendix One: Black incomes as a percentage of White incomes in Idaho and Wyoming].\n\nNo doubt, one quickly learns that American-born Blacks in Idaho are (drum roll)….around .75 percent of the state’s population, or at least work force, so it is easy to throw at least one critique Mr. Thompson’s way, that this is a case of too few Blacks historically or today to excite antipathy and oppression.\n\n[And since we were talking in a former church, it was even easier to remember the famous Bible passage on the response of ancient Egyptians to a growing number of Israelites in their midst that “the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.”]\n\nHere, I can at least bet that Mr. Thompson will have responses to counter-arguments like this within a recently finished study in which his research was a critical part of overall findings and conclusions from Professor Rama K. Malladi, of the University of California at Dominguez Hills; one of the key components of their article was responding to why the incomes of Black Idahoans are as relatively high as they are. Outside of that writing, one of Phillip’s rejoinders to the sense that “oh, there aren’t that many Blacks in the state anyways, so they’ll be more accepted” is to note that two of the worst states for Black economic outcomes – North and South Dakota – also have….small numbers of Blacks.\n\nThompson, a Boisean six generations – strong on his mother’s side, feels impelled to share all of the opportunities which the city and the state have afforded to Black people, one example being the pioneering leadership status of his mother, Cherie Buckner-Webb, seen here…..\n\n[courtesy of Phillip Thompson]\n\nHer distinctions include being the first elected African-American state legislator in Idaho history and the state’s first African-American woman legislator. And the displays he has created reinforce Idaho as a place of opportunity from the beginning (1863, territorially) through its “modern era”, which he dates as beginning with statehood in 1890.\n\nPerhaps the first figure to be honored at the museum from the state’s territorial days is Lewis Walker….\n\n[courtesy of Phillip Thompson]\n\n…a Maryland native who headed west and became successful as a barber, real estate owner and more, especially in his adopted hometown – the one-time mining center of Silver City – from 1864 onwards.\n\nAnother remarkable contemporary was George Washington Blackman, born in Kentucky, quite possibly as an enslaved person, and attracted to Idaho’s mining opportunities in the 1870’s.\n\nHis name adorns the Idaho mountain Blackman’s Peak, among other natural landmarks and you can read a little more from this museum sign….\n\n…as well as hopefully have easier access to the sign’s QR code right here, for a short writing on name origins you probably would not expect, from him and others….\n\nMoving on to the early 1900’s, one of the IBHM displays highlights Erma Hayman (1907-2009)….\n\n[source: https://www.ermahaymanhouse.org%5D\n\n….a long-time resident of Boise’s River Street neighborhood, whose house is being preserved and reopened just a few blocks west of the museum, looking a bit lonely as seen from the south within an area sprouting new developments, but still with an attractive white fence enlarging what is meant to become a well-used events space….\n\n…and seen from across Ash Street where it was once part of a lively early 20th-century block of new Boiseans from places including Japan, the Basque region of Spain, Croatia and more….\n\nThe city’s Department of Arts and History is overseeing the preservation and reuse of the house as a history and cultural center, advocating on one municipal site for its rebirth with the main point that “[m]ost [of the] structures from the early days of the River Street Neighborhood have been lost, and like so many areas populated by immigrants, Black Americans, and members of the working class, its stories have gone largely overlooked”.\n\nThe diversity of this particular neighborhood, with echoes today in the Boise area, will be fleshed out a bit further in a second appendix. For many….the “A” word absolutely assures (think of an “a” synonym for boredom)….but my second “Appendix” will offer some history once again and a slice of Boise’s present – both unexpected in terms of diversity, at least from a “bigger city” lens – and a few pictures as well. [See Appendix Two, “Ida-hospitality from Victorian days to today”.]\n\nIn short though, Director Thompson brings such highpoints of Idaho into his historical argument that the state, overall, has allowed equal opportunity to more than just White Christians.\n\nWhile Phillip Thompson may be the best salesman for his native city and state, he also portrays shameful moments in state history, such as moments of power for the Klu Klux Klan, as suggested here, where you may be able to access a QR-coded article [while a pay-wall may be in place]; in its last two paragraphs, the article notes a few aspects as to the KKK almost coming to power in Twin Falls, Idaho:\n\nAnother exhibit sign in part highlights a sadly successful effort to push out Chinese immigrants, summarized in the paragraph towards the bottom left:\n\nReturning to the Klan, Thompson is decisive in displaying a Klan robe discovered in Silver City, Idaho (ironically, as noted earlier, a very positive place for Idaho territory pioneer Lewis Walker)…..\n\n…and it was one of several launch-pads for his critique of what might be considered a liberal/left approach to history. He passionately commented that if people are going to complain about white supremacy in our day, they cannot at the same time be against showing such an ugly artifact, as otherwise, there is no visible basis for their rant.\n\nIn an overlapping light, he spoke of what he sees as an “outrage machine” on the left, and one of his main rhetorical questions during my time at the IBHM, was – not to me but in reference to various expressions – “are you just expressing your opinions, or are you communicating conclusions based on facts?”\n\nPhillip’s critique of the left finds a parallel in how he perceives other big cities in the Northwestern region of the U.S. He shared at one point that a number of people in Boise “will compare Boise to Portland, and that’s not appropriate….they should compare Boise to Salt Lake City”, this observation at least in part because of Portland’s liberalism, in relation to which he added “who wants to go there anyways?” – that query with the sense of its being overrun with unhoused people.\n\nThese were by no means his only critical words, and in the spirit of “brevity is the soul of wit” – so my wit is not so dim!! (at least to keep this core essay shorter:)) – please see yet two more appendices, respectively on his views (#3 below) and mine (#4).\n\nAs stated above, I would hope you are getting a good read minus appendices, but to the extent you want to travel vicariously, dig into dialogue and/or see a few photos, please check out those additions to this writing:)!\n\nI do not want to leave my greatest concern here for “appendices” though.\n\nIt is that the message of needing to move beyond the victimhood of Blacks – from a Black person – can be hijacked by White extremists and, with any such messaging, we will be that much closer to a return to proto-fascism in 2024 and beyond. I am glad that I raised this issue with Mr. Thompson, if in somewhat different words, and felt reassured that he began to articulate his own opposition to the farthest “Right” [or should I say Wrong] in America, saying that January 6, 2021 represented the first non-peaceful transfer of power in our history. [Phillip later clarified his sense that either extreme – the farthest right or left – is destructive to the American fabric.]\n\nI am so glad that I walked into the IBHM, and, among other things, saw its take on the march of humanity and of justice, including a timeline of race-related history in the “Gem State”, two examples being that of 1921….\n\n….and 1961….\n\nIn many years to come, I hope that Mr. Thompson and the IBHM continue to thrive and grow and be part of a larger dialogue towards an American exceptionalism that he treasures, even if our respective definitions of that…beacon on a hill may differ.\n\nThe greatest goal here in a way is a respectful communication following active listening, and with much more to come. I am blessed that it can be within the fascination and sometimes joy of history, and discovery of new places, as in my time in Boise, Idaho in March, 2023.\n\nAppendix 1: Black incomes as a percentage of White incomes in Idaho and Wyoming\n\nDuring the March visit noted above, Phillip Thompson pointedly noted the percentage level of Black incomes in relation to White incomes, saying it was 105%. Very shortly thereafter, as written above, he shared the same type of figure for Wyoming – where he said Black incomes were 95% of White ones.\n\nThese conclusions are based on a study focusing on the years 2017-2019 and put out in July 2020, and actually, Department of Labor statistics for Idaho sweeten the cherry on the cake a tiny bit, saying that Blacks earned $106, not $105, for a White worker’s $100.\n\nAt the Labor Department site here, you can look these figures up by cursoring down to “Idaho” and “Wyoming” respectively: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/about/data/earnings/race-and-ethnicity.\n\nAppendix 2: Ida-hospitality from Victorian days to today\n\nI would echo what Mr. Thompson says in addition to his pro-Idaho history argument, that the state by no means has an unbroken happy history as to newcomers, and, today, people on the left such as myself are conscious of the far right, especially in the far north/Panhandle area of Idaho. As I landed “out west” in the Spokane airport on February 24 for four days in that Eastern Washington city, I saw the ad below reminding one of the proximity of Northern Idaho….\n\n….and made a crack to myself that we (or WA state:) were also close to the far right.\n\nWith that notable disclaimer of blue planeteers too often turning their noses at the thought of ye olde Potato State, it was fascinating, as well as interesting to me as a historical tour guide in Philadelphia, to see the close proximity of three distinct spaces that very much speak to an Idaho welcome in the late 19th century, the early 1900’s and today.\n\nWhile many engaging spaces in Boise are too far apart from each other for a walking tour, unlike so much of Central Philadelphia, I’ll bet that THESE three spaces have likely ALREADY formed a great walk, or could.\n\nFrom north to south, they begin and end with key points in Jewish history for Idaho, and, in between, with somber as well as celebratory stops in the history of a very new immigrant group in this part of the American West.\n\nShortly before coming to Boise, I learned, not only as a lover of history, but as a Jew, that….surprisingly….Idaho lays claim to being the first state to have a practicing Jewish governor. His name was Moses Alexander and his American life began after he emigrated to the United States from his native Germany in 1867, while still in his early teens. His success, both in Chillicothe, Missouri, where he did well in business as well as becoming the Mayor, and later as a store owner in Boise, led him to the Mayor’s office of Idaho’s capital, for two non-consecutive two-year terms, and, almost a generation later, to the governor’s office in his adopted city, from 1915-1919.\n\nAll of that led me to want to see his burial site in Boise’s Morris Hill Cemetery, based in an area of town known as “The Bench” – an area label which works for me, given that its name is remindful of the Yiddish verb “Bentsch”, for “to bless” (as in saying a blessing) and it definitely contains the most notable scene of Jewish worship in the region – the synagogue and related properties of Congregation Ahavah Beth Israel.\n\nNot so far from that Judaic landmark, I saw the family plot including Alexander….\n\n….and within it, the grave stones for him and his wife Helena seen here….\n\nFrom there, it is perhaps a five-minute walk at the most to a southern point in the cemetery where Morris Hill continues to tell the story of a place that affords opportunity for immigrants, in a cluster of tombs for Bosnian Moslems who have been resettled in Idaho, and with some very recent dates of passing at times, including the last two years. Taking it from Phillip Thompson, Boise might be the most successful city for refugee resettlement in the United States, or at least very close to that summit.\n\nWhile I am currently deferring the inclusion of photos which I took of particular stones, these individuals “have names like….” (as journalist Charles Kuralt might have said in his televised American travel forays years ago)…..Alomerović, Hasanbegović, Rahimić and Suljagić (keeping it wiki-respectful there and not using actual names seen in Morris Hill Cemetery).\n\nThis was easily within view of a very historic synagogue structure, seen here…..\n\nfor a congregation built up in part by Moses Alexander, whose good fortune in the world of department stores was key in most likely garnering direct support from at least two legendary donors for its construction – Marshall Field of Chicago and Levi Strauss of San Francisco – but at least their companies have been cited as contributors.\n\nAnd while one might instantly think “San Francisco” if asked….What city has the oldest continuously used synagogue building west of the Mississippi? ….Boiseans widely believe that you just saw the answer above, from what I’ve gathered, partly because two legendary (and clearly older) congregations in San Francisco built new structures in the 20th century.\n\nWould that the beautiful 1890’s Moorish-style structure, with its intimate interior seen here…..\n\n….was “in situ” as preservationists say for structures, paintings, etc., at their original locations, but thank God as well that it was moved uphill to the Bench in 2003, from 11th & State Streets near the heart of Boise.\n\nI want to thank select staff members (and “CABI” members) for their wonderful hospitality and assistance in this brief look at “CABI”, whether on site when I visited in March or through e-mails since then. They include but were fortunately not limited to Rabbi Dan Fink, Roy Ledesma, Kali Cusimano and Joanna Jost and I wish all the best to them and their synagogue family in the new Jewish year of 5784 which began on September 15, and well beyond.\n\nAppendix 3. Further views of IBHM’s director Phillip Thompson\n\nWhile I sensed in my brief communications with Phillip Thompson that he does not want to necessarily be the center of attention here, he has deep beliefs, and the enthusiasm to not just dole out history but offer it in a spirit of advocacy for what he sees as a positive world view. Had I not had a great experience inside the former structure for St. Paul’s Missionary Baptist Church (now “IBHM”) in Boise, I would have still believed that the views here need to be part of a respectful struggle towards a better world.\n\nEasy enough, perhaps, but, as far as the “hard listening” I alluded to above, at least a tiny handful of statements below will drive some people up their respective walls, and believe me – I am chomping at the bit (not a Western rodeo bit either:)) to respond to a few of them, but…..if each of us expects to be judged fully and not castigated on the basis of one or two statements, we owe that to almost anyone else.\n\nThat does not include….a handful of….putative leaders, people who do not actually care about regular people, etc. [Name a name or names as you wish here and now in 2023.]. Even with them, it is about determining the roots of their expressions, with compassion towards the anxiety and fear that precedes intense tribalism, hate and the like.\n\nThe basis for discussion in my mind should be….Do you really think the person on the other side of the ideological table wants to do you harm, or just feels differently about an issue, and perhaps really deeply, as deeply as you might feel??\n\nIn a nutshell, one might say that Mr. Thompson’s views are: not to dwell on historical sufferings of the past, but to focus on present-day opportunity, while at the same time telling the very hard truth of parts of history such as deep blemishes covered above like Klan dominance at brief points of Idaho history.\n\nIn addition, he volunteered at one point that “only America has used race to divide [its people]”, or at least more so than other countries…saying that “we’ve taken it to the next level”.\n\nNo doubt he is conscious of his Blackness and feels that race is clearly one attribute for a person but focuses more so on “opportunity” broadly stated. He notes that from “a data-driven perspective, capitalism has been the greatest tool for improving the lives of humans”.\n\nOne of the very first things I heard him say after I entered the museum was that “the Idaho experience is anomalous but should be instructive – that it is best for government to get out of the way, and people will flourish”. In addition, one of the very first things I heard him say….when I visited the museum for a second time, was his sharing with an older White couple that “[m]y grandfather was the first black graduate of Boise State and it wasn’t because of some herculean effort, it was just a non-issue…..I wish more people would take more notice of our hands-off approach”.\n\nLater, he said to me that “I believe…most things can be boiled down to economics, not race” and that “race is a byproduct of economics”.\n\nHe reinforced this by saying that in terms of friction points in American history, that “mass immigration stresses resources – whatever the incoming group in question, and can lead to the charge that “ ‘you’re taking our jobs’ ”. It seems definite that he would bolster this by pointing to the violent reaction to high numbers of Chinese entering Idaho in the late 1800’s.\n\nAnd, whatever my views, I could easily underscore this by pointing to violence against Irish Catholics in the 1840’s here in Philadelphia, and can at least theorize that the economics of the “age of exploration” in Renaissance Europe lead to a sense of Europeans as superior to peoples of color – as a rationale for harvesting the resources of the Americas. [Pardon if you will my polite language here, and the irony of referring to the “Renaissance” in this case, as that label so often symbolizes enlightenment.]\n\nThese….dry, non-emotional…observations [or so I believe:)] can give way to Phillip’s critique of the Left that it will heavily, and too emotionally, scratch the past itches of our societies, instead of being fact-based.\n\nOne local example, for him, was that of speaking to some students at Boise State University a few years ago when the discussion swung to micro-aggressions – a concept with which he was not familiar. This recollection led him in part to say to me that there can be “too much encouragement for students to share their feelings, partly [in regards to such] ‘micro-aggressions’ “. In relation to that and on at least two other occasions during our brief exchanges, he would say “that’s what a therapist is for”, i.e., that these are personal issues, at least overall, and should not be conflated or exploded on a public stage.\n\nAt one point, he said to me….”What is this about micro-aggressions? My [forebears] were worried about acts like lynchings”…..meaning, for him — actual major aggressions. This is a reminder of two themes to which he would return – first his belief that there ARE actual problems in the nation and the world, sometimes serious, and secondly an essentially positive view of America ca. 2023, and especially Idaho.\n\nElsewhere in my visits, in discussion with a Boise area woman and me, he said “slavery has been normal in a number of societies throughout history and if you are opposed to it you should not talk about what went on at one time but fight actual slavery still going on today”. This was echoed in his offering the insight at one point that the “killings of women in Kurdistan are a REAL example of a [violent] patriarchy…. not [whatever goes on in] the US”, and he raised this example in connection with a woman who as of early March was hoping to become a resettled refugee in Boise.\n\nOn the national as well as home front, he made the point in conversation with me later, that he does see problems that exist, environmentally for example, and does something about them, with his emphasis there on not using plastic wherever possible. Additionally, he bikes at times from his North End neighborhood to IBHM, largely for the “cardio”, but knowing it also happens to be good for the environment.\n\nThe FACTS for him, if heavily Ida-centric, one might say, are largely that we live, in much of the United States, within a positive framework, partly in terms of overall health and actual lower levels of violence – as compared with points in the past – [despite the pain of seemingly daily news in such regards]. I noted that this conclusion is very remindful of that of Steven Pinker, who has argued that the world, on aggregate, is very much an improving one in recent decades as well as centuries, thanks to the benefits wrought through technology and capitalism.\n\nWithin Boise itself, Phillip revels in the blessings he feels within his hometown. In part, he looks at his boyhood neighborhood of the North End, and feels that for him and his daughter, they are better off than 90% of humans, etc., within “the greatest country ever…in a period of lower violence overall [and] with an abundance of amenities” a viewpoint which I was reminded of one day as I looked down from a balcony at a Whole Foods market just a few blocks from IBHM….\n\nPhillip said that “from my mom’s generation to me to my daughter” that there have been many improvements” and added that his daughter, who turned 12 this past March, “has only known a positive world, including going to a school that he helped to found. In correspondence after my visit, he wrote, using the nickname of “Junior” for her and spelling out….the “N” word – that a “case in point at her current school [was when] a child – who was [a] non-white child but not Black either – called her a N- … I received a call [about this incident] and when I asked Jr about it she said ‘I don’t even know what that means’ — her life is that good”. Last year, for him, that positive state was underscored by her interviewing the mayor of Boise, with his observation that “that degree of access for my kid is unfathomable”.\n\nHis positive spirit as to his city and state can easily be paired with his buoyant feeling as to at least one strand of red, white and blue – the idea of American exceptionalism. He offered that he is “not by nature a patriotic person,” but added that “I’ve become more patriotic as I’ve grown older”, especially in regards to the widespread idea of the exceptional nature of the United States in its allowance for changes in our governmental system. He later added that “the architects [of our Constitution] included a means to append and correct their vision [with their] being fully aware it was a process in order to achieve a ‘more perfect union’ ”.\n\nHe says that it is “mind-blowing to have that degree of humility….[and a sense that…] we’re not going to get it right the first time” but “we’re going to leave a system in place that allows us to get this better.” He enthusiastically concluded that “the exceptionalism is found in admitting fallibility….that’s HUGE!” and added that “that’s why I’ve become a gung-ho American exceptionalist”.\n\nFrom America’s self-correction mechanisms, one could move to his fervent sense that Black History commemorations should definitely be corrected. In short, he says they are often way too negative – or narrowly-focused on stereotypical areas of Black achievement – the former very much in reference to….enslavement, the latter regarding sports and ENTERTAINMENT.\n\nIn an e-mail of March 8, he wrote that “US Black history is far more than the notion of “ills perpetrated against,” although that is part of it….[and] more important are the contributions and uplifting aspects of Black history. He readily shared something I had never read – that the “first Black man in America was Juan Garrido, the Portuguese conquistador, contrary to the thought that the first Blacks arrived on [American] shores as slaves [in] 1619”.\n\nA Black conquistador who may be Garrido is seen in the image below from a fascinating but undated manuscript known as the Codex Azcatitlan, written by unknown authors sometime between about 1550-1700. While the Codex focuses on what is today Mexico, Garrido’s footsteps include time in Florida when he served under Juan Ponce de Leon.\n\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juan_Garrido_Azcatitlan.jpg]\n\nPhillip sees Garrido as a positive counter to “those who commercially exploit what they see as reflecting Black history [and] seem to view us in regards to entertainment, sports, and ills that have been committed against us, diminishing the vast contributions not of only those that were remarkable, but the vast majority of blacks who don’t fit into these categories”.\n\nHe wrote in regards to a recent video “streaming subscription” that “I chuckled [as to its] vast numbers of recommendations for celebrating Black culture, but [felt that they were] overwhelmingly not something I would want my [12-year old daughter] to emulate or identify as…Black culture”.\n\nLater, he texted that, among many who convey Black experiences, there is a “lack of effort to examine/explore/emulate communities that defy and excel in the face of challenges” and that “they act as if that doesn’t exist or at the least they fail to acknowledge and let these successes be known”. He capped this by saying that “they are not trying to remedy [misunderstanding of Blacks, etc.], but “simply trying to exploit” more dramatic and negative stories.\n\nI am hopeful that what follows in terms of Phillip’s conclusions, etc., does not itself seem too dramatic or negative. At the same time, I realize that for many Blacks and White progressives, some of the world views above and below will be simply untenable for discussion. I hope that all readers agree, at least in theory if not in all instances, that we must engage in deep listening – to the largely “unpalatable” if not untenable.\n\nBefore I offer five examples in this regard , from my listening in Boise, I will direct readers to the next appendix and a segment where I very briefly comment on the limits of tough listening, knowing I cannot assess that for people of color – or for anyone else, but also believing that there are many people like me who want understanding and peace. People will of course ask – when is outrageous too outrageous to even listen to? or….when is a thought so grossly offensive that you should not be part of a discussion?\n\nIf you are beginning to feel such questions, I would…very much regret your exiting the IBHM freeway here, prior to the final paragraphs of this section, with the next access road being….Appendix 4:).\n\nMoving just below from less sharp to…too sharp? – it all depends on your viewpoints….I’ll present five basic points from Phillip Thompson.\n\nI’ll start with a point of agreement between Phillip, me and a white lady from Boise who I had noted as a visitor to the museum. It was very much in reference to slavery in America, but could apply to a number of tragedies, themes, etc., and was simply the…cliche?…. that you should not look at the past only through YOUR contemporary lense but as someone in the 1800’s, etc., would have thought about it.\n\nWhile that may sound easy at first, I believe it can be overtaken in certain classrooms because of deep-seated beliefs that delving into perspectives of “the time” means that one agrees with vastly immoral acts as many more people see them today.\n\nSecondly, Phillip is (not surprisingly?)…not in favor of reparations to Black Americans for slavery. I personally – and without effort I’d say – “rate this” as a widely held position in the U.S., apart from whether or not one would see it as moral, immoral, insensitive etc.\n\nHe feels it is “a false premise that you can right a historical wrong” or “that those who are going to pay [reparations] are guilty of that historical wrong” and added that “you are giving money to those who are not the victims of the stated wrong”. Both he and the Boise woman noted here discussed the aspect that once you pay reparations, that will not end the debate as they thought some defenders of reparations have implied but that various people will still want to raise the issue. [In a text of July 21, Phillip added that “other than [in] cases of known theft of property (reparations seem) like an ill-conceived notion, literally throwing money at a problem without addressing or fixing it”.]\n\n“Number 3” here, at a somewhat harder or slightly more cutting level, sees Phillip at one point in early March reflecting the sensitivity of many White Americans that they are being labeled racists, and no doubt I would affirm that this is at least a valid concern in the minds of those people. Overlapping with what I wrote earlier, people are complex, and we cannot know the fullness of their lives by a few statements, wordings which seem prejudiced to us, non-incendiary to them, etc.\n\nHis pushback as to the label of racism was directly addressed to progressives increasingly believing that you are racist if you are not actively anti-racist. Here, he said that by that logic, people who do not actively fight the trafficking of children are therefore in support of trafficking of children.\n\nNumber 4 on the sharpness meter will be a snoozer for some, and make others squirm every time we hear it. It is an “old saw” in my book, and when the Boise woman offered it – saying that “not all slave owners were bad”, Phillip did not seem to respond unfavorably, while I did not follow up as to his thoughts here.\n\nFinally for at least this short list….The woman in our conversation related the argument – whether genuine or just “devils’ advocate” – that an area professor had said that he believed in reparations, including ones for descendants of slave owners – because they were following the law at the time, but were not reimbursed for their property.\n\nAppendix 4. Making sure I respectfully do not bite my tongue on this one:)!\n\nI hope that our constructive spirit in discussion at IBHM will also allow for my own counterarguments here, out of a dual respect – for my own views, but also honesty as the highest form of respect. I will not respond comprehensively, even if I can only imagine the apoplexy of a few of my associates who are yet more progressive, or whatever term they would feel is best for themselves.\n\nFirst, I partly agree with Phillip Thompson on a few points or at least easily see the validity in some of what he is saying, and really, some level of validity to some extent in EVERYTHING I heard from him. Validation, at the same time, does not necessarily mean agreement with various views.\n\nWhile I partly disagree with his sense of himself that “I’m not conservative, I’m not progressive, I’m reasonable” – I definitely agree with the….”reasonable” part if that is based on civil exchange and his statement at least echoes how so many of us are “air hangars” (my words there), or “contain multitudes” to paraphrase Walt Whitman, in the variety of our own views.\n\nAs much as I am “game” to listen to thinkers like Phillip Thompson – often on a different part of the ideological spectrum, I am trying to keep in mind how some others would fold their arms and walk away in this case.\n\nAs a White American Jew, I cannot fully understand various perspectives of many if not all Blacks, and at the very least, many of them may interpret at least a bit of the above the way I would view certain statements in regards to Jews. If, for example you solidly believe Jews are central to a conspiracy for world domination or that the Holocaust did not happen (through Nazi Germany and its collaborators), those can most certainly be non-starters for discussion. If you accept the horrors of the Holocaust but also want to place some emphasis on German trauma as a basis for the Holocaust – both for the young and shell-shocked Adolph Hitler and then for Germany getting a raw deal as part of the end of World War I, that can be a starting point for discussion, and one can easily offer an analog as to today’s white supremacy arising, in part, out of the implosion of many majority-white manufacturing towns and neighborhoods after the 1960’s.\n\nIn closing perhaps, on where one “draws the line”…..Many of us – and I know it won’t be all of us – must be open to even the farthest end of the spectrum from the “Left” – well beyond the Phillip Thompsons of the world; here, I mean the views of extremists, as to the chance that they will open their hearts and minds. One of the best examples of a “hater” who came in from the heat is that of Christian Picciolini.\n\nIf we are even open to them, we should be open to bridge-builders like Thompson.\n\nAs for disagreements with Director:) Thompson…..\n\nThe first point I would make is that there is an outrage machine on the right, and just as Mr. Thompson is clearly against certain “Far Left” positions and influences on our culture, “the Left” likewise climbs many a wall in a collective upset (my vote quite often as well) to fabrications produced by the most….extreme far-right members of the Capitol Hill clubhouse. More deeply and with more perspective, there are so many facts of history in regards to which we should get outraged and then passionately study them, not to “hate” on anyone, but to become stronger and get farther away from what we have often been as a nation or how European colonists behaved.\n\nIt is only after many decades, if not centuries, that many of these facts are only seeping out to the general public – one increasingly well-known example being the violent coup which ousted a multi-racial city government in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1898. In fairness, the Phillip Thompsons of the world answer to that with part of THEIR “job” in history, which in his case includes the truth of Idaho’s darkest days in the past, noted twice just above.\n\nAt the same time, I realize….especially in a time of high polarization – (much of it heightened by the media) – that many Americans on the left will not listen to some or all of what true conservatives, moderates, etc., believe in.\n\nIf we charge a number of people on both major U.S. “sides” with emotionalism, perhaps rationalism can win the day in terms of [believe it or not]…reparations. While it seems objective that an American in 2023, and especially a young person, is not responsible for enslavement in our land, it also seems level-headed to conclude that there are clear forks in the road of history where Black people would have had more economic success if the dominant White society had not stopped them. One of them comes with the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, which cut off a very likely and continuing stream of wealth in its mayhem of fires, murders and more.\n\nI am most definitely not ready to “rule” on my sense of reparations, but we sure as h—- need to bring back massive affirmative action, whether through strengthening pre-school in poor areas period – White-majority Appalachia, majority low-income communities of color, etc – insuring adequate legal counsel for the poor – why the hell are we still f——— around with that years after Gideon v Wainwright !!!????, etc, etc…. [And yes, I realize I am writing this particular passage in early July, 2023 not too long after the “Sup Co” as I call it struck down race-based admissions to colleges.]\n\nEven though those conclusions are pretty self-evident for me, part of my wording would be a discussion-stopper for many conservatives. It’s a reminder of Phillip at one point saying that “there are certain ways you can say something that will mean the same as if you said it with other words, but which will not upset people [or] cause you problems….[otherwise] you can find you are suddenly being stonewalled on projects because of offense you caused [in regards to a statement]”. His comment in particular referred to an ongoing consultation as of March with a new Idahoan whose success he wants to see [in a non-profit work arena, basically] before that resident would be sidelined as he has suggested.\n\nSounds very “reasonable”, but, part of my internal response thereafter was….If Idaho is so enlightened, why worry about your wording that much?\n\nAs to the evolution and deevolution of what was once “Idaho Territory”, I see – on the one hand – validity in Phillip’s basic argument that positive history affects positive outcomes today. Additionally, while my defensive hackles were up for my native Ohio when he learned of my “origins”, I am open to his bluntly stating – to me and a lady with Mississippi connections – that with Idaho, Ohio and Mississippi, you are talking in downward order about three very different places for Black people. More specifically, his historical point, once again, hearkens back to the openness to integration very early on in the Territory, especially within public education, as a reason for the very strong income results of recent years in at least Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nHaving affirmed all of that….\n\nOne does not have to look or listen so far in recent years for some large lack of openness and enlightenment in the states within this one-time jurisdiction. And I realize that there are people out there who truly see incredible virtue in their Republican leaders and legislatures, to be clear. In fairness, I would especially note firm beliefs as to the sanctity of human life from conception.\n\nAt the same time, without any wizard of theology or the law at my side, I think that the far-right responses to the issues below can be greatly critiqued in connection with Phillip’s belief that if government is unobtrusive then the people can flourish.\n\nHe touts Idaho’s “hands-off approach” but the arguable cruelty of imposing one viewpoint from one part of one faith (Christianity) on women (in regards to abortion), holding down transgendered people and the contributions they can make to community and statewide prosperity (read: make more money for the state), and curtailing at least a few other freedoms – does not make the government so light and helpful.\n\nThat may be adequate for most readers, but I wanted to do my homework to a modest extent on today’s triumvirate that once made up Idaho Territory…..\n\nI’ll start with Montana, where I cannot yet forgive Congressional CANDIDATE Greg Gianforte, now, sadly in part – Governor – for assaulting a journalist, or, much more recently, his signing a bill which would ban gender-affirming health-care for trans-gender minors. I am heartened at least that the state’s first openly trans representative – Zooey Zephyr, and others, have at times loudly resisted this anti-freedom movement.\n\nIn Wyoming……While a widespread abortion ban put into effect in March 2023 has been temporarily blocked by a judge, and abortions can be performed in the state until mid-April 2024, at present….the ban’s components are extensive, and it would end all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or extreme risks to the pregnant person’s life. Additionally, abortion providers could be considered felons for providing abortions, leading to a fine of $20,000 and/or up to five years of imprisonment.\n\nIn Idaho….a partly similar law went into effect on May 5, while it is also the first in the U.S. which specifically criminalizes assistance with out-of-state abortions.\n\nIn “Idaho other news”, Governor Brad Little signed a bill to allow the State to carry out death penalties through firing squads. In fairness, many consider the death penalty humane and just in regards to its proving the ultimate punishment for murder, but I’ll tend towards virtually no death penalty and…leaning towards firing squads being “medieval” in their coarseness and graphic nature and potential trauma for each of their shooters. An Idaho Republican state senator, Dan Foreman, felt that the use of firing squads would be “beneath the dignity of the state of Idaho”, adding that they would traumatize the executioners, witnesses and the workers who would clean up their areas afterwards.\n\nIn closing, there is MUCH to clean up based on all of the issues raised throughout this writing, but I hope that…..\n\n…We can also tout whatever is moving forward in former “Idaho Territory”, one very recent example being the lawsuit in June from young Montanans who assert that their state has not upheld the commitment in its 1972 Constitution for a “clean and healthful” environment and that, separately and more broadly….there can be….\n\n…so much more respectful truth-telling, listening and validation – including the respect of honesty – and\n\n…so many more explorations of good differences, in our museums, on the streets and more,\n\nwith an eye towards more freedom and true civilized life for all.\n\nSources\n\nAnti-Racism, with Christian Picciolini’s rejection of Neo-Nazi and related culture as an example; it has been perhaps ten years since I first heard about his journey from days as a young skinhead to recent times, and was glad to see he remains active in working to change minds, at his website (https://www.christianpicciolini.com) and elsewhere.\n\n“Bensch” or “bench” – Yiddish for “to bless” in regards to reciting a blessing, in sources including https://www.balashon.com/2006/11/bensch.html\n\nBiblical passage on the growth of the Jewish population in Egypt from https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Exodus-1-12/.\n\nBlack incomes as a percentage of White incomes in Idaho and Wyoming.

To be more specific, there are two San Francisco congregations which appear to be the earliest ones still in existence: Emanu-El and Sherith-Israel, both with origins in 1851, with Emanu El in a 1926 synagogue and Sherith Israel in a 1905 worship space. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_Emanu-El_(San_Francisco) and https://noehill.com/sf/landmarks/poi_temple_emanu_el.asp —AND— https://www.sherithisrael.org/history.html and https://www.theclio.com/entry/31051.]\n\nAfter returning from Boise, the new-fangled Boise aficionado within me was momentarily pained to learn that Jefferson City, Missouri appears to have a 12-year edge on Boise in the “oldest continuously used…” category noted above, with the apparently adorable (and still-Jewishly active) edifice of Temple Beth El having been opened in 1883, and still at the same spot in its 141st year. My wincing subsided into happiness, as, in a case like this, the older the better! [https://templebethel-jc.org/history/ and https://theclio.com/entry/32259]\n\nI cannot make a definitive case for Jefferson City here, but the “templebethel” site above says that its edifice is “the oldest synagogue building west of the Mississippi that is still in use”, the Clio site has essentially the same wording and a Wikipedia site on the oldest synagogues in the United States notes that Jefferson City’s Temple Beth El “has continuously operated in the same location and building since 1883”. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_synagogues_in_the_United_States]\n\nTwo “trans-Mississippi West” structures originally built as synagogues before that of CABI have not seen continuous and regular Jewish use since their openings, but are “physically” healthy from what little I gathered and likely to see occasional Jewish community use (or more!) in either recent years or moving forward; they are the 1891 Temple Emanu-El of Helena, Montana and San Diego’s Temple Beth Israel of 1889, moved in 1978 to a park where its use for weddings may of course include Jewish ceremonies.

I am a native of the Cleveland, Ohio area, and over a period of 37 years or so, I have thought that it would be incredible to save and reuse a rusted and noble symbol of Cleveland’s past – the Sidaway Avenue Suspension Bridge…..\n\nLooking towards the north side of the Sidaway Bridge from near 67th Street and Sidaway Avenue on February 12, 2023\n\n…linking the Garden Valley and Slavic Village neighborhoods.\n\nAs I turned thoughts into occasional action through discussion and writings on a blog site, starting in 2011, I quickly realized that as a visitor to the “Bridge area” – from my adopted city of Philadelphia – that I should be a part of telling stories from near the Bridge, if with an obvious goal of saving and positively using both history and historic structures.\n\nMy main focus at present has turned out to be the Elizabeth Baptist Church, a 104-year old congregation which has been based near the Bridge since 1944.\n\nMore recently, my inquiries have slowly turned to how the Church got its name. This writing will largely celebrate a member named Lewis Tate (1899-1988) who is credited as the reason for the name. Additionally, it will look at the likelihood that the idea of Northern Black church names like that of Elizabeth being transferred from the South was a notable phenomenon during the historical era of the “Great Migration” of Black Southerners from approximately 1910 to the 1970’s. [Endnote 1.]\n\nThat is what I have begun to hear from individuals who have lived and breathed the Black Church experience, and at least one Black history authority, but as a student of history for fifty years, including the history of Black America at times, I believe I need to really plant that phenomenon of naming in firmer ground, or not as the case may be. Studying history is a journey, knowing it is far less bold than leaving everything in the South to move to an uncertain if promising North, but I hope that fellow students, and authorities as well, will join me and improve what I have written here.\n\n*********************\n\nIn January 2018, as I was working my way to an historical essay on Elizabeth Baptist Church, Carolyn Winston, the widow of Pastor Lindy Winston, who led Elizabeth from 1973 – 2003, told me that Elizabeth was somehow born out of a church in Alabama. To me, this felt both exciting and somewhat unnerving, the latter because there had seemed to be two certainties, as with….so many churches – of a founding in a definite place and year – which, in the case of Elizabeth, were: Cleveland, on…April 23, 1919.\n\nIt took more than a little while, but I ultimately saw a picture of the church in Alabama seen as the parent of Elizabeth Baptist Church in Cleveland, and since that Southern landmark has often been known as Elizabeth Baptist Church as well, I will hope that its members understand my at times referring to Cleveland’s congregation as either “Elizabeth”, or EBC:)!\n\nAt least one EBC member told me that I should see a picture in a southeastern corner of their sanctuary building, and when I did, its hazy appearance was appropriate in that I knew so little about the subjects of that photo….\n\nThe caption of this picture reads: “ELIZABETH BAPTIST CHURCH, FORT DAVIS, ALABAMA / The lady in the picture is his sister, Annie Bell Tate Johnson (Deceased 1951).”\n\n…including not knowing about the “Mother Church” in question, who Annie Bell Tate Johnson was, and who her brother was. [See….Endnote 2 for some guidance on these last two questions.]\n\nSometime after learning that the FIRST “Elizabeth Baptist Church” in this story was in Fort Davis, Alabama, a tiny community 12 miles south of Tuskegee marked here within a regional map…..\n\nGoogle Maps 2022\n\n….and in a close-up where “Elizabeth Cemetery” above the red pin signifies the location of the church on U.S.Highway 29…..\n\nGoogle Maps 2022\n\n….I saw two contemporary pictures of the Church in photos taken by EMBC member Helen Samuel….\n\nThese photos very likely were taken in the second half of 2022.\n\n…..…..a long-time friend of CLEVELAND’S:) EBC member Rubye Jones, who shared these photos with me.\n\nMs. Jones, seen here…..\n\nRubye Jones, seen after the EBC service on March 27, 2022\n\n…can in September 2023 look back on 62 years as a member of EBC.\n\nWhen she joined at the age of 18, she had just moved to Cleveland from her hometown of Tuskegee, so it was appropriate that she helped to guide me on a path to learn more about Lewis Tate, as he had attended Elizabeth Baptist Church in Fort Davis in his youth; that experience would have been formative if indeed he was the key member to give EBC its name in Cleveland in the early 1920’s.\n\nAs I like to say, he is known as the reason that anyone – members, visitors like me, and others, SAY “Elizabeth Baptist Church” in Cleveland, so I hope that this highly incomplete record is one way to begin to honor him, with hopes for improving it in the near future.\n\nLewis Tate was born on December 16, 1899 in Alabama (most likely in or near Fort Davis) and passed away in Cleveland on July 8, 1988, while so much in between is not nearly as specific, or even easily known.\n\nIt is very likely that he migrated to Cleveland in 1921, in which case he would not have been on the ground floor of founding Elizabeth, so assuming he is still its name-creator, questions and gaps in that regard should be filled in – e.g., did it simply have a different name or a place-holder kind of name, from April 1919 until he came on the scene?\n\nAnnie Hall, now 90, seen here….\n\n….and the one-time wife of EBC’s longest-serving leader – Reverend Fred Hall, says that Brother Tate was one of just a few key members responsible for hiring Reverend Hall, and she has related a story of his early status – including his magnetic communication and an otherwise humble station.\n\nShe told me that Lewis Tate and a handful of EBC members heard about Hall as a powerful young preacher in Detroit and traveled there in 1924, when their congregation was about five years old. She said that Tate was a deacon at the time, and he, his wife Luella and Luella’s mother – Lulu Johnson – all went to Detroit. I do not know from my discussion with Ms. Hall how many members went on that visit to Detroit, while she notes that Elizabeth had “16 members in all….but they didn’t have a minister” and that “essentially, they were the core of the church”.\n\nWhen they saw Fred Hall, they liked his ministry and asked if he would come back to Cleveland with them.\n\n“They liked him so much, but he said ‘I’m not a minister…I have no clothes….I have no car’…cause he was driving a truck or something in Detroit…‘I don’t have anything’.”\n\nMs. Hall went on to say that “Sister Smith [or Ida Smith], said ‘I’ll have two suits made for you’, adding that ‘[you should] go to Lyon Tailors [in Cleveland], and have them make two suits for you’ ”. According to Annie Hall, Ida Smith paid for that.\n\nSometime after she shared these recollections with me, Ms. Hall noted that “he had on the suit that he preached in for the committee from Cleveland….but made them aware that he was a laborer and didn’t have clothes that ministers would be expected to have”. She added that “he probably had [just] the one suit that he was wearing and was aware that he needed an additional suit”.\n\nIn 1954, shortly after she married Reverend Hall, Ms. Hall at one point asked him – “What about your wife, did she have any clothes made for her?”, and Reverend Hall said that somebody gave her a dress.\n\nAnnie Hall ended this short account of a simple start with the likelihood that “I think Sister Smith also bought him a car”. [Endnote 3]\n\nReverend Hall’s material and spiritual life would be supported partly by the work of many members, and in regards to Lewis Tate’s status in the material world, I could gain at least one snapshot from 1930, six years after that expedition to Detroit.\n\nAt that time, thanks to the U.S. Census, he is noted as a truck cleaner, as is his younger brother Randle, with notations for that “occupation” and, just to the right, their “industry” – four lines apart in the excerpt below, where Lewis Tate’s record is on the sixth line down, also identified as line 13 to the right, with Randall Tate’s notations on line 17.\n\nIt appears as well that the ladies of the Tate household also had job solidarity, if not jobs in the same place, in that Luella Tate and her mother Lulu Johnson (listed as “mother-in-law”) also had the same basic job, each as a “Laundress” in a “private family”, as seen on lines 14 and 18 respectively below.\n\nFinally for this first census image, I cannot explain how the notation for a “fuller dry cleaner” refers to an industry [in the second of the wider columns below]….\n\nIt was enjoyable to see Brother Lewis Tate on “paper” (on-line to be sure), and more so to see his name and that of other Tates (on lines 13-18), a few columns to the left of those “job columns” on what seems like it was a large sprawling sheet of paper:\n\nThrough this document in large part, I realized that Lewis’s son James – who would become a brief and shining star in national gospel music – was born before Lewis Tate married Luella Tate. Combining that with the assumption, at first, that Lewis Tate was only 19 when he named and helped to found EBC, I questioned how such a young man with a child born out of wedlock could be given such influence.\n\nI credit Rubye Jones here in her observation that such births as well as early rises for young dedicated church leaders were not uncommon during the Great Migration, and also realized the irony – as valid as a researcher’s questions are – that I was asking this question about a man who was 19 – the age at which his son – James Tate, probably reaches his zenith of fame in music.\n\nAs to James Tate, I encourage readers to see Appendix 1, with brief biographical notes, partly on his involvement in the choir known as “Wings Over Jordan”, perhaps the greatest gift to Black Gospel music ever born in Cleveland.\n\nOne final note on the 1930 census and related documentation is that they seem to suggest Lewis Tate may have wanted to be close, and at times very close, to EBC, but the geography of his life – or fragments of it – echo his dedication to Elizabeth.\n\nFirst, I’ll start with a picture, which may be worth a few hundred words.\n\nJust below, thanks to a map which is likely to be from 1937, but following the construction of one of Cleveland’s early federally-funded housing estates – the Outhwaite Homes – you will see two pairs of numbers.\n\nTo the left, you can see where Lewis Tate lived in 193o and the location of Elizabeth Baptist Church in that same year – just one block apart, while you have to imagine a block which would have been more like the two dense blocks immediately to the left of numbers 1 and 2 below. Reinforcing that, a quick early scene in the movie “RACE”, looking back at Jesse Owens in Cleveland in 1933, is full of at least one long row of wooden houses and not the new machine-like “future” of the Outhwaite zig zags and more of a few years later. [Endnote 4]\n\nTo the right, in a section also much denser than it is today, you can see the location where Elizabeth rented space from Liberty Hill Baptist Church as of 1940 and, on the very same block, a lot for the address where Lewis Tate is noted as having lived in early 1943.\n\nSomewhat later, as is most well-known to a few Elizabeth members, Brother Tate lives right behind the Church in what is to date its longest-lasting location – of 8005 Holton.\n\nIn regards to tangible locations, I encourage readers to look or look back at my major blog on Elizabeth’s history, about 15-20% down from the top at the following site, where you’ll see a directory notation for EBC’s 46th Street location in 1930 and, just a bit below that, a picture of what I call “the old red building”, where it rented space from Liberty Hill a few years later. See: https://silverstravels.wordpress.com/2019/12/19/clevelands-elizabeth-baptist-church-an-historical-essay/.\n\nThe locational puzzle pieces above led me to wonder if Mr. Tate was a sexton for the Church, but that remains an intriguing possibility and it is easier to depend on the sense of Ms. Hall that EBC gave Lewis Tate a place to live in gratitude for his support of Elizabeth. In regards to Brother Tate moving into the “parsonage” of the Holton EBC church , she says that “[h]e didn’t move back there until I was a teenager, an adult almost – I was 18 or twenty when he moved back there”, which would mean he began to live there in or around 1951-1953.\n\nIt appears from what little I have gathered that his dedication to EBC was echoed in his commitment to his family, both in the education of his children and as a husband. At least one key theme of an obituary in 1988 is his push for children in his family orbit to go beyond the partial public school years which he achieved, including his niece Zepherine Tate Hearring, who was like one of his “own”….\n\nGrateful to have received this obituary, with the likelihood it was part of the program for Lewis Tate’s funeral service at Elizabeth on July 15, 1988, I would research James Tate further, having sensed he did not graduate from Oberlin in 1937, but started as a student there at that time.\n\nAs to Lewis Tate’s being an influence for children more broadly, Charles Ellington II, who is 75 and whose father’s mother was a founding member of EBC, remembers that he and his sister Lydia called Brother Tate “Uncle Punch”. Mr. Ellington does not remember why but wrote me that “he spent a lot of time with us as young kids [and was] very kind and friendly [at the time he] lived in the house behind the church…”\n\nThe few anecdotes that I have received on Brother Lewis Tate suggest that he was also a devoted husband and a leader as a singer at Elizabeth. Rubye Jones remembers Lewis Tate lifting a wheel chair to which his wife Luella was confined, in the years just before her death in 1968, and she noted that Michael Winston, seen here in early 2022…..\n\nMichael Winston after the EBC service of March 27, 2022\n\n….seconded this recollection to her from his teen years. [Endnote 5]\n\nIn regards to his musical skills, I was pleased to learn from Annie Hall that Brother Tate would sing somewhat prominently at EBC services – and this was not surprising given the choral prowess of his son James.\n\nWith no wealth of information on Lewis Tate, I had no expectations when I asked …… if she at least recalled Mr. Tate’s octave range – if he was….a baritone? etc., and she gave a fuller answer here, saying he would at times lead the congregation in what she labeled “meter singing” or the “Doctor Watts” method of ritual singing.\n\nAs to my “voice level” inquiry as to his singing, she said “[w]hen you sing meters you don’t sing baritone….or soprano [etc]”.\n\nShe started to depict what a meter singer would do….prefacing that by saying “it’s like a ball pitcher”, where you throw out the first ball and wait for the response.\n\nShe depicted Tate perhaps saying “I love the lord, he heard my cry” and the congregation then singing “I love the lord…he heard my cry”.\n\nAs she returned to 50 years ago or more, I am recalling that she sang the next lines in her illustration of meter singing: “As long as I live and trouble rise….I’ll hasten to his throne”, adding that the church [the congregation] would repeat that in a song.\n\nShe further explained as to a meter singer that “you can’t tell what voice he has” because each song may have a different pitch or a higher tone.\n\nShe had e-mailed me a YouTube video with a stirring rendition of the song “Father I Stretch My Hands to Thee”, told me “that was his favorite song”, and, “at every church service, he sang that” while she later corrected herself to say he did this often. [The video she noted presents Rev. F. C. Barnes and Company from a DVD titled “Come On In The Room” and appears to have been posted Mar 18, 2014; it is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feIOj5Kq5nc.%5D\n\nWhen he sang it, “it would be prior to every service, to prep” the attendees for what came next, and then….“the pastor would be amped up to preach”.\n\nMs. Hall said that this structure manifested itself “before choirs”, saying that “people didn’t have choirs years ago” but rather that they had meter singing.\n\n“They [opening singers like Lewis Tate] got the crowd amped up” according to her, “like he was the opening act”.\n\nShe commented that his singing the song was a case of “when the spirit hits you, you holler….That was his song”.\n\nAnnie Hall’s next and final memory of Lewis Tate departs from his vigor as a family and church man to a broad recollection of her visiting him in a health care facility before his death. She said that her visit to him came between 1975 and 1989 based on her living in Chicago during those years.\n\nShe told me that “I came home from Chicago to visit” knowing that he had gotten dementia and he…“was in a nursing home — it was on Cedar Avenue or Quincy Avenue….He was tied down with something [while she could not recall if he was restrained with bed sheets or something else]….at that point he was not Brother Tate anymore”.\n\nAs to when Lewis Tate was not a mortal man anymore….\n\nIn an earlier draft for this section of this essay I wrote – with what now seems like a naive assumption:\n\n“I plan to improve this point in the story, or an appendix, with photos of the separate tombstones of Lewis Tate and Luella Tate at the Highland Park Cemetery in the suburban Cleveland village of Highland Hills”.\n\nWhen I visited the cemetery, I quickly discovered it was not easy to find where the Tates were buried, because neither of them HAD tombstones.\n\nA helpful staff member did not know why, and two other groundskeepers were helpful in my finding the Tates’ respective locations, under grass basically, each between two individuals who may simply have had more money with which to buy memorial stones.\n\nLewis Tate’s burial site can be seen in context here, with the back of the cemetery’s administrative building slightly visible in the distance, roughly above the center. Based on plot numbers, his location is in the small green section towards the lower right, on the line between the light brown stone towards the bottom center and the dark stone towards the right center.\n\nLuella Tate’s burial site can be seen in context below, with the back of “Tower East” – the tallest building in the adjacent city of Shaker Heights – very visible towards the upper right. Based once again on plot numbers, her location is in the green section towards the lower right, on the line between the stone partly visible towards the lower right corner and the partly uncovered stone to its upper left.\n\nIf you are further interested in lifting these two Elizabeth church members from their relative obscurity, please see Appendix 2, “Burial Sites for Lewis and Luella Tate at Highland Park Cemetery, Highland Hills, Ohio”.\n\nBeyond his passing at the age of 88, I hope that Brother Lewis Tate – seen as the reason we say “Elizabeth Baptist Church” in Cleveland – will be happily remembered and that this scant record will be greatly improved.\n\nNo doubt, Lewis Tate’s life and service can be a point of departure for a broader story, as I suggested in my introduction. In this case, I have chosen a question of origins – where a Southern church name may have been directly used or modified in migration to the North – and, just below, have one brief account in that regard where it may have happened, as well as an account of a Cleveland church which was definitely named after a Southern one.\n\nLiberty Hill Baptist Church\n\nSince I first began to know people in what I call the “Bridge Area”, close to the Sidaway Bridge (see my introduction here), one of the individuals I have greatly enjoyed meeting is Ruby Alexander, introduced in earlier blogs I wrote, such as one at http://silverstravels.blogspot.com/2012/07/stories-near-sidaway-bridge.html and seen here in a more recent photo….\n\nMs. Alexander is a founding member of Original Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, at 7109 Kinsman Avenue, and as a child, she was a member of Liberty Hill Baptist Church, which helped to keep Elizabeth going for a number of its early years, as I wrote in 2019 in my essay on EBC history.\n\nAs I noted there, Liberty Hill is situated in a very prominent edifice at 82nd & Euclid, seen here courtesy of a Google-based view…..\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps, September 2022\n\nIts move there was from a building which, to the best of my knowledge, still stands at 5713 Kinsman, on the north side of the street.\n\nImmediately to the southeast of this red-brick structure with white trim is another structure built for church use, and that is where EBC rented space from Liberty Hill during the 1930’s and likely until the time it moved to its long-time home at 8005 Holton. That short-term home of EBC is seen in the background below, to the right of the building near the top center here:\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps, August 2021\n\nLiberty Hill began in Cleveland in 1917 and, based on a significant connection in her family, Ms. Alexander thinks it is possible that it was named after a Southern church with the same name; that church was in Monroe County, Georgia, which is southeast of Atlanta and is lightly:) highlighted below with red dotted lines, near the center of the picture:\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps, 2022\n\nRuby related that “my Mom lived in Monroe County….[and] when her father was dying, he gave each of his children to a different sister” and “the sister who got my Mom came to Cleveland. This aunt – later Ada Thompson – raised her, and Ada helped to found Liberty Hill Baptist Church in Cleveland; Ms. Alexander thinks that her influence may have been a bridge over which that name came to Cleveland. Ruby notes that her great-aunt Ada was the chair of the Deaconess Board and her husband Tom Thompson was the head of the Deacon Board.\n\nRuby added that her “mother’s father and mother are buried in the Liberty Hill Baptist Church cemetery in Monroe County, Georgia”.\n\nIn an overall sense, she is one of a few people I spoke with for this essay who thinks that there was a lot of adaptation or transfer of Southern church names for new Northern congregations. [Endnote 6]\n\nPhilippi Missionary Baptist Church\n\nPhilippi Missionary Baptist Church (PMBC), seen here in yet another internet view (with hopes that I will actually take photos in Cleveland once again!)…..\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps, 2022\n\n…is a younger presence in Cleveland than Elizabeth or Liberty Hill Baptist Churches, but with early 20th-century roots as well.\n\nThanks to Ms. Annie Hall, who generously contributed to this writing as seen above and who now belongs to Philippi, I had the pleasure of speaking with her brother and Philippi’s founder – General Ellis Martin, seen here…..\n\nand now 97. He continues to be Pastor Emeritus of the church and according to his daughter Methia Martin Weems “he is still a formidable giant in Philippi, the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio and surrounding areas” She adds that “the pastors and ministers have dubbed him as “The General” or “The Elder Statesman” and continue to seek his wisdom and advice”. According to Ms. Weems, writing in 2022, Pastor Martin “at 96 years of age….is still preaching, driving, and can beat me walking!” It was wonderful to receive a part of his story directly and I was privileged that she took the time to bring us together and answer questions as well.\n\nOne basic one was as to his name of General. When I first heard it, I thought that it might be an “honorific” title given to him with his success in leading the church he founded, but it is his first name.\n\nThe story that both of them began to share is one not of just enhancing a former name but of a 90-year old vision.\n\nPastor Emeritus Martin told me over the phone that “I was brought up in [Alabama] and we went to a Philippi Baptist Church, and he said that on “my first day in school, when I saw angels on the wall….a word came to me [and] I wanted to build a church…I was about 7 years old”. Through Ms. Methia Weems, I later learned he had a clear vision at that age of leading the church.\n\nHe relates that at the time, God “showed me three buildings”, and that is how the map of his Cleveland church unfolded. It began with an initial storefront location at 7819 Carnegie, then a fellowship hall and a church at 11401-11403 Union Avenue which “got too small”, followed by Pastor Martin and others landing at their current site on Corlett.\n\nThe initial Carnegie location is noted here by a red pin near the right center, within a map showing a large part of Cleveland and a few suburban areas:\n\nAll three Philippi locations over 61 years are noted just below, from the top center to the lower right; the current location – indicated by a red pin – is just a few blocks below the second (Union Avenue) site:\n\nAll of the work that Pastor Martin has done began in a way in his childhood when he was attending Philippi Baptist Church, out in the country in Alabama’s Coosa County, six to seven miles west of the town of Kellyton, with its general vicinity seen here around a red pin for the town of Kellyton:\n\n….and a broader region here:\n\nHe carried that early experience up to Cleveland, arriving there on February 14, 1945, and keeping his vision alive as he and other members of his family joined Elizabeth Baptist Church. EBC’s Reverend Fred Hall ordained him at the same time he ordained Reverend Lindy Winston, who would, as I have noted, succeed Reverend Hall.\n\nWhile General Ellis Martin kept his youthful Church’s name alive, he feels that the Lord spoke to him to name his own Cleveland church Philippi “Missionary” Baptist Church because he felt God wanted the church to go out and do “mission” work throughout the community and city or as Pastor Emeritus Martin says, “ I wanted ‘missionary’ because I believed that “missionary” is helping other people”.\n\nPastor Emeritus Martin, seen here in front of the first Church location at 7819 Carnegie with his wife Mozelle Martin and a 3-year-old Methia Martin….\n\ntold me that “we moved in [in]….Feb 1961….I had seven people on a roll…with me and my wife and two sons” as part of that group, and, in addition, on the first Sunday at PMBC, “it was a lot of people came”, including 14 additional people.\n\nHe noted that “later on, we started raising money, and we raised up to about 80,000 or 90,000 dollars, and we got some CD’s”, and….in time, PMBC had $103,000.\n\nThe congregation used that to purchase a dilapidated structure which Pastor Martin’s father had found and which had been an antiques store, on Corlett just east of 116th Street.\n\nWith Pastor Martin’s first name, it is easy to see a unified pride and discipline when Ms. Weems conveyed that “we marched into the Corlett building in 1967” and “we marched into” the new building behind that first Corlett church structure in 1991. Both the old and new sanctuaries are seen here….\n\n[All photos in this segment appear courtesy of Methia Martin Weems unless noted.]\n\nToday, Philippi Missionary Baptist Church continues under the leadership of Reverend Kevin Byous, Jr., who became the leader of PMBC when Pastor Martin stepped down from its pulpit in 2012 after 51 years as a pastor there, while he still preaches and is in ministry to others.\n\nI wanted to also set down further information I received on Pastor Martin’s family and its migration to Cleveland, partly because we are talking about an ELIZABETH family here.\n\nHe told me that his brothers came first and then his father, in 1944, and that his brother “came and got me” in 1945, with his arriving in Cleveland on February 14, 1945 as I noted above.\n\nHe conveyed that his mother and sisters of his came on May 17, 1945, coincidentally just one day after his 19th birthday, on May 16.\n\nHe said that “another sister, next to me, she came shortly after, in May”, and closed this part of his account in sharing that “my brother’s wife, she was expecting, she stayed in Coosa County til she was able to come”.\n\nHe later shared with me, partly through a note from his daughter Methia, that those May arrivals just before his 19th birthday included his mother Elizabeth, his sisters Maggie, Annie and Dorothy, and a cousin of Elizabeth named Essie Mae. Additionally, his sister Vernell stayed behind briefly to help take care of their pregnant sister-in-law, Maude, the wife of their brother, Frazier.\n\nAs to the “original” Philippi Baptist Church in this story, Pastor Martin said “it closed…in the 70’s, cause I knew I went down there in ’70-something, and the building [for the church] was still there [but appeared to be abandoned].”\n\nWhile Philippi Missionary Baptist Church seems to clearly be his greatest legacy, much of his life has been devoted to Elizabeth Baptist Church, starting from the time he came to Cleveland until…well beyond his founding PMBC.\n\nHere, as in a few other instances, my assumptions as a visitor to EBC and to the histories of other churches have fortunately been challenged.\n\nIn this case, I assumed that once someone founds a church, they in a sense have no clear need for another or previous church, but I learned that Pastor Martin was a member of Elizabeth from 1945 all the way to 1992, to the best of his recollection. In this regard, I will probably easily remember the statement of Ms. Weems, Pastor Martin’s daughter, that “every pastor needs a pastor”.\n\nIn 1992, Pastor Martin chose to attend a new church – New Bethlehem Baptist Church, at 6515 Woodland Avenue, and remains a congregant there. [Endnote 7]\n\nA wider story of keeping names alive?\n\nThree members of Elizabeth Baptist Church in Cleveland have been among many whose lives can tell just part of one of its stories – of often being founded or strengthened by individuals from the South, with Alabama perhaps being most prominent in this regard.\n\nSeen here, they are Rubye Jones, standing next to Willie Ligon at the left and Pearl Ellington at the right…\n\n[November 3, 2019 at the time of an EBC service; photo courtesy of Rubye Jones]\n\nIn brief, on each of these three EBC members….\n\nRubye Jones has been a towering presence in this writing, certainly the most generous assistant to my inquiries, and is now nearly a 61-year member of Elizabeth since coming to Cleveland from Tuskegee, Alabama and beginning to attend EBC in September, 1962.\n\nWillie Ligon, who I briefly interviewed by phone when he was 100, was born in 1918 in Tuskegee and has passed away, I believe at the age of 101 in 2020. He came up to Cleveland from Alabama in 1940 and joined EBC in the 1960’s, grateful then and forever after for the supportive conversations he had with Reverend Fred Hall, as I write in a 2019 writing [noted already in this post] at https://silverstravels.wordpress.com/2019/12/19/clevelands-elizabeth-baptist-church-an-historical-essay/.\n\nPearl Ellington was born in Hardaway, Alabama, just west of Fort Davis, attended St. Mark Baptist Church, also in Elizabeth Baptist Church’s community of Fort Davis and came to Cleveland in 1946. She is 98, currently resides in Detroit, and keeps connections with EBC, the life-long church of her son Charles Ellington II, who is now 75. [Endnote 8]\n\nRubye Jones, Pearl Ellington and Willie Ligon are among so many Cleveland-area residents who emigrated from the South, starting with the greatest wave of the Great Migration – from perhaps 1919-1945, and continuing thereafter for a while as that wave was still breaking.\n\nThe Southern-born Black men and women and children who moved up to Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh and many more cities brought not only an urge to leave the South, but – for many – a passionate connection to it, and it is quite likely – based on my brief exploration here – that their Southern possessions included a number of church names as well.\n\nI am guessing this is a well-known fact, actually, but….am still hoping to reach historians who can attest to that, or correct that notion – as this “goes to post”.\n\nWhile I did not prove that this was the case as wiser heads have trained me to try to do, I would guess that many Southern names dotted the new settlements of Northern towns and cities, partly because of that very human desire to keep some of a homeland alive.\n\nToday, for many students of the Great Migration, the number one book is The Warmth of Other Suns, by Isabel Wilkerson. It is often built around particular individuals and organizations and their experience in moving North and elsewhere, largely to industrializing cities whose jobs drew them in – very much in the Midwest and the Northeast, and perhaps with the West Coast as the next biggest magnet for them.\n\nOne organization Ms. Wilkerson returns to on a number of pages is the “Monroe Club”, which actually sprouted up in a multiple cities including Chicago, thriving at least for a few decades on individuals who left Monroe, Louisiana, so, in a broad sense, groups like this definitely preserved a hometown name.\n\nIn what I think was a brief but meaningful survey by me of readings on the Great Migration, I would say that the closest approaches to the “planet” of transferring an actual church name to a new church up North came with a summary comment on some of the new churches in Chicago in the late 19-teens through the 1920’s and, separately, an example from Cleveland.\n\nOne brief Great Migration survey said that some Southern congregations moved to Chicago as a group, keeping both their customs and their group identity. The desire to keep alive the intimacy and liveliness of Southern church life displayed itself in many small prayer groups – which would meet in a migrant’s home – and storefront churches throughout Chicago’s South Side. [Endnote 9.]\n\nReturning to Cleveland, one sees the same phenomena. Here, I’ll refer to two earlier periods, with one naturally being the era of the Great Migration. Secondly, as the following comes from a book of the 1970’s, it is dated in at least its use of the label “Negro” but the writing – A Ghetto Takes Shape / Black Cleveland, 1870-1930, by Kenneth Kusmer – remains a major source for Black history in Cleveland.\n\nKusmer writes that…\n\n“Conspicuous among the new churches were the numerous storefront congregations of the Holiness and Spiritualist sects and the poorer Baptists. In the 1920’s, lower Central and Scovill avenues were dotted with the makeshift edifices of these congregations. These churches, with their personalized, informal services and fervid religious emotionalism, appealed to many of the lower-class Negro migrants from the South. Some of these new churches were able to preserve the congregations of southern communities almost intact. For example, one black minister, Charles C. Ailer, came to Cleveland from Alabama with his congregation and founded Zion Hill Baptist Church. This type of institutional “transplanting” gave a measure of continuity to the lives of southern migrants, and helped smooth the path of their adjustment to urban society”. [Endnote 10.]\n\nAt other times, similarly, those who arrived from the South began churches which “replicated Delta practices” – with this quote referring to how Chicago’s Black life was often flavored by Mississippi migrants – but they did not instantly set these congregations in motion, doing so after the trial and error of joining – in brief – the wrong type of church for them.\n\nThis was likely to be that of earlier or “Old Settlers” Black churches, and in Cleveland, these included ones which were partly “upper-crust” in terms of the income of a number of members. Two in this regard, with all the pride of their longevity, are Mount Zion Congregational Church and St. Andrew’s Episcopal, respectively established in 1864 and in 1891, well before the huge stream of Blacks coming up from the South.\n\nKusmer writes that “[n]either church was interested in accepting working-class Negroes as members, and most recent migrants from the South would have found the staid, dignified services that both provided rather uninviting”. Kusmer notes that the content of sermons at those two elite institutions and more working-class churches was similar, and he says that “[i]t was the highly emotional form, not the content, of the typical Baptist sermon that the black upper class found distasteful”. [Endnote 11]\n\nToday, Elizabeth Baptist Church might be largely unrecognizable to its first members, partly because of its own greater affluence since the day when – like so many other churches – it started in someone’s home. It has changed in many small ways, including the hard work of so many members over the generations, and so many new names since its founding in 1919.\n\nIt does, at the same time, include a number of 3rd and 4th generation members if not deeper familial roots and its name most definitely remains.\n\nExploring the origins of that name and many other anecdotes and stories can be a tool for understanding this church community and deciding what to keep from the past and how to change and evolve. Besides those “practical” reasons, it is always time, in a way, to honor people such as Brother Lewis Tate who helped to achieve new beginnings.\n\nAppendix 1 – James E. Tate and “Wings Over Jordan”\n\nJames E. Tate – one of two children of Lewis Tate – may well be the best-known member of his family, as he was the first conductor for what became one of the most famous musical ensembles in Cleveland history – Wings Over Jordan, a celebrated gospel music group from the late 1930’s through the 40’s in particular.\n\nAs with Lewis Tate, I will provide a few fragments and artifacts of the life of James Tate, but first, a brief introduction to the illustrious group he briefly conducted.
