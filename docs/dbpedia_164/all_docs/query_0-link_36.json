        "text": "Hi, as discussed in Commons:Graphics_village_pump#Why_is_Category:Manually_coded_SVG_hidden? I created a new template {{Created with Text Editor}}. It's intention is to make it clear to autors that a SVG file is best edited with a text editor, because some programs like inkscape are not well suited for that. Examples are File:Sierpinski-Trigon-7.svg or File:Root-2-3-5-loglog.svg. {{Created with Text Editor}} is implemented using the magic of {{Autotranslate}} and {{Documentation}} and shall add the file to the already existing Category:Manually coded SVG.\n\nHowever, the \"Created with ...\" templates always add to a category named \"Created with *\" and therefore I created Category:Created with Text Editor and redirected to \"Manually coded SVG\". But there are two problems with that:\n\nSome files tagged \"Created with Text Editor\" get added to cat \"Created with Inkscape\", an example is File:Particles_by_fundamental_interactions.svg (use \"edit\" to see \"Created with Inkscape\" is used).\n\nFiles in cat \"Created with Text Editor\" don't get forwarded to \"Manually coded SVG\".\n\nCould anyone help out of this and guide me through the template jungle? --Georg-Johann (talk)\n\n...seems the problem is fixed now, I touched all affected pages. --Georg-Johann (talk)\n\nFor more informaton about LiquidThreads, see Commons:LiquidThreads\n\nI propose to experimentally enable LiquidThreads (lqt) on commons. Quick overview:\n\nLiquidThreads replaces discussion pages with actual forums, giving the following benefits:\n\nA clear, simplified post/reply workflow so new users can jump right into the discussion.\n\nSimple management of threads, including automation of archival, refactoring, and other tasks currently undertaken by bots and humans.\n\nA powerful, flexible notification system, allowing users to keep abreast of developments in areas in which they are interested, ranging from entire discussion pages to discussion fragments.\n\nSupport for following discussion pages with RSS feeds.\n\nFlexible post ordering, allowing users to keep track of which threads on a talk page are dead, and which threads are active.\n\nA modern, AJAX-based interface, that allows users to post and reply to other posts quickly, without clumsy page loading.\n\nAutomatic signatures.\n\nI don't mean to enable it for every talk or discussion page, but only to enable the technical possibility, for admins, to create LiquidThreads. This would enable us to test how Lqt would work with our existing processes (for example deletion requests), what would be needed to be fixed before it can be used more widely & how our existing Javascript gagdgets would need to be modified with to work with Lqt. Lqt is already used on a few wikis, eg.\n\nstrategy.wikimedia.org (in places)\n\nEnglish Wikinews (in places)\n\nEnglish Wiktionary (in places)\n\nMediaWiki.org (in places)\n\ntranslatewiki.net (all talk pages)\n\nYou can test the extension here--DieBuche (talk) 12:47, 5 August 2010 (UTC) (bold by Saibo (Δ) )\n\nStrongly support. Deploying LiquidThreads on real WMF wikis is a step long overdue towards a superiour discussion system that eliminates an entire host of frustrating problems. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nSupport I wouldn't mind enabling it completely. However, we should make sure that we archive all talk pages of the old system, so that the both systems don't conflict. This was one issue that I noticed at Translatewiki (where it however didn't really matter since only few talk pages exist there). --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nComment Based on my expirience on Translatewiki, functionality is definitely good. However, visual style, look and feel is out of sync with other MediaWiki pages. I think Usability team should work with this extension before wider deployment. --EugeneZelenko (talk)\n\nThe style could most likely be refreshed per MediaWiki:Vector.css to better fit to vector.--DieBuche (talk)\n\nSupport Definitely an awesome feature with a huge potential. We should help it by implementing it and providing feedback. And yes, we can fix the design ourselves if needed. Those design fixes are be part of the feedback as well. :-) Dodoïste (talk)\n\nOppose I needed to stop working of strategy because lqt doesn't work good on mobile phones, when this will be enabled here on Commons I would be forced to stop working here on 80% of the time I'm online. First fix the extension so it works always, than maybe I would support.\n\nSecondly we are a multilangual project, very few people knows what lqt is, we should wait untill more people know the extension otherwhise we will scare new people away. Huib talk Abigor @ meta\n\nAs I stated \"I don't mean to enable it for every talk or discussion page\", but only on test pages so that problems like these can be evaluated. How is multilinguality an argument? It seems to be localized in most languages & how would people know it, if they never see it? Especially for newcomers it should be more intuitive, because it's more like classic forums, they can't forget to sign etc..--DieBuche (talk)\n\nSupport It's better. --Davidpar (disc.)\n\nComment LQT, as already pointed out, still has lots of bugs, there's an ongoing major redesign and AFAIK it's quite likely that won't be enabled soon on bigger projects because of current scalability and performance issues. --Nemo\n\nOppose. IMO it solves a non-existent problem. It detatches people from wikistyle editing. The resulting discussion pages are not more clearly structured than what we have now. It takes away flexibility. To me it falls in the same category as WYSIWYG-editing, at first glance a great idea, at a second look it does more harm than good. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nSupport It is a must --Extra999 (talk)\n\nComment - \"A modern, AJAX-based interface\" Duh?? - Please clarify. - MPF (talk)\n\nGoogle is your friend. First result. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nSupport, of course. It would be more better for new users. JenVan (talk)\n\nBut Commons talk pages (at least those for individual images) are almost entirely used only by the most experienced users, and that is clearly not primarily a matter of difficulty, since that is not the pattern for talk pages of Wikipedia articles. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nOppose. Yes, lqt are pretty good for a small number of short discussions on a page. But they are making discussions enormously large if there is a large number of brief comments. Even if these comments are very short (like just “Support” or “Oppose”), each comment takes some three or four lines, so that 10 comments already take a full screen. This system is more appropriate for something like comments to blog entries than for wiki-discussions as it hides some comments (unlike blogs, comments here are usually not senseless), is very difficult to administrate (deleting/protecting such pages is a problem) and has too many bugs (like problems with wiki-markup in headers, which makes translatewiki:Project:Translator rather unattractive) — NickK (talk)\n\nI can't say I'm particularly enthusiastic about this feature, but testing it in a \"real\" context and gaining feedback from real-life experience can only lead to a much better integration when/if it goes mainstream.\n\nSupport. –Tryphon☂\n\nSupport We need a better discussion system, too many people are locked out by the learning curve of the present system. LT has its limitations, but unless it starts deploying, these cannot be sorted out. --Vigilius (talk)\n\nSupport \"enable LiquidThreads on some test pages\" - this does not mean support for an migration, yet. Enabling it on test pages is a good thing to try it out in a real wiki with my user settings and such. Please tell us, where to test then. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nOppose the current system has its flaws, but it is reliable and the same as the other wikis.--GrapedApe (talk)\n\nOppose unless look and feel will be not adjusted to style of wiki skins. It's task of Usability Team if I'm not mistaken.--EugeneZelenko (talk)\n\nSupport Same reason as Vigilius. --Kozuch (talk)\n\nI'm on the fence about this. LQT seems like a very good concept, and definitely represents the general direction Wikimedia discussions should go. The promised functionality is a great leap over where we are, will ease the way for new users, and will reduce the confusion inherent in large and complex discussions. And I don't share the allergy some folks here have to pioneering an changed/improved approach on the Commons. THAT SAID, from the comments above (esp. Nemo's) it sounds an awful lot like LQT is still an alpha product, not even advanced to beta yet. I'm okay testing out a beta in production systems, but an alpha needs to stay in the labs until it's mostly baked. Even restricting it to only a few production pages is not a good approach. But I'm not in any way an expert in dev control standards and I have hardly read comprehensively on the status of the LQT dev effort. Maybe someone else could clarify whether I'm correct in my application alpha/beta definitions? —Werewombat (talk)\n\nOppose please don't. Per above opposers. I find them not very practical & rather confusing. --Dferg (talk · meta)\n\nSupport lets give it a try. Amada44 talk to me\n\nOppose Very cluttered and makes pages several times larger. Long threads will be unreadable, and hiding comments is certainly not a good idea. I'm not in favor of heavy use of AJAX because of browser and platform compatibility issues, not mentioning load times on slower connections, so instead of making talk pages accessible to more people, we could end up doing the opposite. If the main disadvantage of the current system is inaccessibility to new comers, why don't we improve it in that regard without changing it completely? For example adding automatic signatures when saving a new section, maybe adding a \"reply\" link at the end of signatures, or improvement to the editor interface. -- Orionist ★ talk\n\nComment Before taking position, I would suggest first a larger scale experiment on a wiki where they have many discussions with many participants, such as on en:wiki. I don't feel that Commons is a place to do such experiments. --Foroa (talk)\n\nSupport - I like them and they work well on the liquidthreads test wiki. — Jeff G. ツ\n\nOppose - I don't see a real benefit here. Perhaps, as suggested, we can get en.wp or some other pack of gullible fools to perform a large-scale test. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nSupport overdue. --rtc (talk)\n\nOppose - I personally find liquid threads unnecessary and confusing. Tiptoety talk\n\nSupport LiquidThreads is amazing. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nOppose Strong oppose After using lqt for over hour instead just posting a couple comments, I now strongly oppose even enabling it on a single page. It's very difficult to do anything but the most common of tasks and the performance kills usability making us less productive by increasing the time it takes to read and make threads. There's way too much overhead and too many potential issues it would cause for something we don't need to begin with. I understand why so many people support this, it's actually pretty cool when you first try it out; the problems become more apparent the longer you use it. Rocket000 (talk) 22:32, 26 August 2010 (UTC) Unnecessary and I don't like the current design at all. Let's wait for en.wp or some other major wiki this time. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nWhat is a \"major\" wiki? en.wn, en.wikt, strategywiki, Mediawiki, and translatewiki are already using it, and pt.wb, sv.ws, se.wikimedia, and Hungarian Wikipedia have requested it. Are any of these \"major\" wikis? :) --Yair rand (talk)\n\nNot really. I guess I meant a large Wikipedia, i.e. a site that's usually a new user's first wiki experience (where they learn things like commenting). Rocket000 (talk)\n\nSupport why not? it seems good.. let's try it :D --Pino723 (talk)\n\nSupport A potentially helpful experiment. Let's give it a try. Steven Walling\n\nOppose per NickK and Abigor --by Màñüé£†¹5 talk\n\nOppose. It's got performance issue for me. As an example, [1] spends 45 seconds formatting the page after it loads; I'd hate to see what it would do on some of the longer discussions here. It's also not too Lynx-friendly: it works, but each comment and associated tools take up so much vertical space that I can only see two or three comments per page. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nOppose This is supposed to be an improvement? The design is awful and the threads could actually lead to more confusion and therefore less participation than the present system. Experiment by all means, but please don't introduce this here as it is. Personally I never even realised there was a problem - apparently - with the present system, until now. Anatiomaros (talk)\n\nComment There's still a lot more development to go on LiquidThreads before it's ready for primetime. Might be best to wait a while longer. Kaldari (talk)\n\nAs Ryan notes, LiquidThreads is under continued development. We've enabled it in production on a few wikis, and we believe that MediaWiki badly needs a next-generation discussion system that's easy, fast, and enjoyable. LiquidThreads still has quite a few quirks at this stage, so I would primarily recommend it for narrowly defined use cases (e.g. a new user help forum). If you're interested in LQT's ongoing development, please provide feedback on the proposed redesign.--Eloquence (talk)\n\nOppose Not a real benefit, no real need. Some technical issues (speed, etc., I've had it \"crash\" on me before), and logistical questions about integration/adaption by other users make it a big hassle for an answer to a nonexistent problem. On the English Wikinews, it is used for user comments only, not talk pages, and I think that is a good application. Here, there is no need. fetchcomms☛\n\nWeak oppose. I wouldn't scream if consensus went that way, but personally I see no significant upside, and I find it a bit annoying. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nOppose I agree with Rocket000. And I'm not sure whether lqt will be efficient for Commons. Discussions about important topics is usually accompanied by many users' comments. I'm concerned the scroll bar will become too long and in severe cases, browser might be crashed in low-performance computer. – Kwj2772 (msg)\n\nI found a new bug. LiquidThreads's signature detection is unfunctional without JavaScript. [2] And while testing the extension without JavaScript. It was very hard and slow to use. – Kwj2772 (msg)\n\nSupport Useful --minhhuy*= (talk)\n\nOppose In my view superfluous eye candy. As Dschwen stated: the resulting discussion pages are not more clearly structured than what we have now. --High Contrast (talk)\n\nOppose for now: Let's wait until the issues are sorted out some more, e.g. mobile phone support and bug fixes. No point testing it when we already know quite a few bugs. Further, it doesn't seem to support right-to-left languages, which is a bad thing on a multi-lingual project, even if they're a small part of our userbase. Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nSupport per Trần Nguyễn Minh Huy --shizhao (talk)\n\nSupport I like having a reply button Jane023 (talk)\n\nOppose Please, please keep it simple. The plain text is good enough - it's fast, it's easy, it's reliable. Throwing in JavaScript eye-candy is only going to slow down the interface, create more bugs and I'm not even convinced it would be easier to use (how hard is it to type or read plain text as now anyway??). I completely agree with Fetchcomms - \"a big hassle for an answer to a nonexistent problem\". Laurent (talk)\n\nSupport It's fantastic. These talk pages suck so hard compared to Lqt. Siebrand\n\nSupport The talk interface is not some sacred formula, and can be very cumbersome with long discussions, so yes, let's give this a try.-- Patrick {oѺ∞}\n\n'Comment I think quite some of you have clearly misunderstood the proposal. The plan is to test this on a few talk pages and work out the problems still preventing it from enabling it on all talk pages. It's not the idea to enable this on all pages. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nOppose Ooh, shiny! But no. Dschwen, Carnildo, Adam Cuerden and others have raise serious doubts and nobody seems to have a compelling argument in favour. Why bother testing something which is years away from being remotely useful? Waste of time. Angus McLellan (Talk)\n\nSupport for \"test on a few talk pages\". Geagea (talk)\n\nOppose Why do we need to have a more complex system? Editing a talk page with LiquidThreads produces more complexity when you're at Special:Contributions: rather than going to a user's talk page on which you've commented, you have to go to the thread and then to the user's talk page. Moreover, if you're responding to multiple sections of a talk page, you have to make multiple edits, rather than just one. Nyttend (talk)\n\nOppose this system don't seems comfortable for me. Анастасия Львоваru (ru-n, en-2)\n\nOppose The LiquidThreads is a solution for many-many non-existing problems. I think the present system need no change, the newcommers are abel to use it, just like the older contributors. --Beroesz (talk)\n\nLimited Support - to enable this LiquidThreads on some test pages as the headline says. I recognize that this system is powerful, but some aspects of it can be confusing, and I think that a test should be a two-way street, with some feedback going from Commons to the developers of LiquidThreads. Wnt (talk)\n\nOppose The current system is conceptually simple. Keep it that way. Everybody is used to the present way and the problems are not worth rocking the boat. Also my limited experience with them at the strategy wiki is that they are slow, clunky, and slightly confusing. Jason Quinn (talk)\n\nSupport Matt (talk)\n\noppose, working with lqt on a WMDE wiki is quite annoying. Current talk pages allow more structured work. Kind regards, —DerHexer (Talk)\n\nComment I don't wish to vote against the new technology, but I'm not sure that it is proper one for this very moment. It should be more compatible with the current look'n'feel. The texts should be more condensed, like current discussions, and there should be a compatible history view mode. So I support LQT, but NOT NOW YET. Dr Bug (Vladimir V. Medeyko)\n\nOppose per above. I don't believe there's anything wrong with our current system. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. -FASTILY (TALK)\n\nSupport There really isn’t anything wrong with the current version (though it does get kind of sloppy), but it doesn’t hurt to give it a try. Azcolvin429 (talk)\n\nComment I don't mind testing LiquidThreads on a small scale, so uptill here you may consider this point a \"support\". However, I know too little about the software. Several of the comments above suggest that LiquidThreads may be very slow, may not work on mobile devices, may not offer the information density of current discussion pages, may be less fit for very short discussions or information exchanges, and may have a user interface which is very different from the usual wiki interface. Each of these problems alone would be enough for me to oppose a large-scale application of LiquidThreads on the longer term. It should be possible to solve the issues within the current system. Besides, it is still unclear to me whether it is possible to use wikisyntax in LiquidThreads. I consider that an absolute must as well. J+\n\nJust test it here. I made an example for you: here. Note: this an direct(!) link to my answer in a long discussion (linked there on top of the page) - try this with the current system. This poll here is just about testing (no customization without testing) lqt in a real environment not about using it here. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nOK, but is there any option to see what you have answered to? The “Parent” button does not work OK — NickK (talk)\n\nSee the line on top and it's links: \"Fragment of a discussion from Talk:LiquidThreads testing\". The \"discussion\" link shows you to the associated thread and the second link shows you the whole diiscussion page. The \"parent\" button seems only to work when viewing the whole thread - maybe it can be hidden when displaying (the special case) only one comment. It shows you the comment I answered to (only useful in long discussions where the parent comment is far away on the top of the page). Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nOppose, perhaps allow here at village pump.--Avala (talk)\n\nStrongly Oppose a general use of this system. Old style discussion pages have the unbeatable advantage that you see the whole discussion at once and that you don't have to click through series of posts and get repeating quotes and the like. Wiki discussion are much more readable, unless they grow to a length of more than a few screen pages. This system IMO only makes sense for use on heavily segmented pages with hundreds of very long discussions.User:Chrkl\n\nIt seems to bring us further and further away from the scope of wikipedia/wikimedia --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nSupport for experimentally enabling this extension on some pages. Lqt is very useful. When it reaches a stable status, it can be enabled for all pages. Srhat (talk)\n\nSupport upstateNYer\n\nNeutral on the fence collecting splinters, anything that reduces participation is a concern, running a test on a few pages is interesting but how would it run parralled to ensure everybody gets to participate. A trail on somehwere like FPC where a duel discussion can occur? Gnangarra\n\nOppose—extension is not mature and it's an attempt to make MediaWiki anything and everything. There are plenty of web applications out there that provide threaded discussions without needing to reinvent the wheel. Adrignola (talk)\n\nOppose, for now atleast. There are way too many issues at the moment. The answer for testing was given in the opening, so I see no reason to enable it here for testing. \"You can test the extension here\". –Krinkletalk\n\nOppose I can see why people would like to support this extension. But I have two problems. First, pages set up this way encourage all the same problems that threaded discussions elsewhere tend to have ... eventually they get lost in themselves and become unproductive very quickly. In our present system that has evolved into common conventions over time without the help of any software, it is usually easy to tell who is responding to whom without clicking back and forth. That's not always the case with threaded discussions.\n\nSecond, it might encourage the sort of new user who thinks this is just a place to hang out and chat. We have enough users who think Wikimedia projects are social networks without encouraging them. Daniel Case (talk)\n\nSupport A trial would not hurt, perhaps on a message board-type page like Village Pump. If we don't like it we don't have to continue. -- Mattinbgn/talk\n\nSupport Yes we should at least give the new Liquid Thread system a trial. If it does not work out we can always go back to the old wiki system. Just Imagine if we succeed in creating a better discussion system then that will be for the global good. The new users are the ones that face maximum hurdles getting used to the wiki concept. I am still learning. The future of the wiki project depends on the new users so making it easier for them is what we should be aiming at. Pattanaik --Pattanaik (talk)\n\nNeutral, does not appear to have any serious benefit or drawback. Stifle (talk)\n\nSupport, it's a good extention. --DS-fax\n\nOppose 'If it ain't broke...'

And it would probably break all scripts and bots that add user messages (making them work for both types would be quite a challenge I think). There's no way to do it the old fashion way on pages that use it, otherwise, I wouldn't mind it as an alternate way of commenting. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nre \"scripts and bots\", wouldn't that be another reason to test it? -- Docu at\n\nSure, but that's why we have test wikis. There's plenty of known bugs that need to be fixed, it's too slow for long pages, it's supposed to be redesigned, etc. It's just not ready for production use. (But obviously some people are ok with using it anyway so this is just one opinion.) Rocket000 (talk)\n\nI vaguely recall a member of WMF staff writing that Commons features cannot be tested on testwiki as that wiki doesn't reflect all features of Commons.

I had to stop working on strategy: for that reason. I'm not 100% sure but I guess it is no longer possible to refer to past talks with diffs, if we implement that system. The fact that very old talks (even those older than 1 year ago) can be reopened is not a good idea. I prefer old talks to be kept as closed archives. I also dislike the potential competition between different threads to be the \"first thread\" at the top of the page. This is not a good way of talking about serious matters. Forums are OK for chit chat, but not for serious talks. Teofilo (talk)\n\nSupport We really should test it in the wild. And NO, it's neither useles nor confusing. The current system is confusing to all little experienced users. --Cubefox (talk)\n\nComment I support the idea of enhancing the dialogue page. However, I'm wondering if other tools have been reviewed or if only this programme tool is open for experimentation. I personally don't know of other tools, but my thought is someone may know of other tools that could be proposed also. I personally would like to see other things out there and then make a decision based on what seemed to work the best. That's pretty much where I stand before committing support. CaribDigita (talk)\n\nSupport I really like working of LiquidThreads at translatewiki.net. There are bugs and a name still unable to translate :), but support--Praveen:talk\n\nSupport for testing; probably needs a redesign before wider use (and not sure the current redesign is going in the right direction). It might have led to a more productive discussion if the problems with the current system are explained instead of the sales-pitch-sounding text from the labs wiki, which makes more sense to programmers than to users. --Tgr (talk)\n\nSupport limited testing on commons, as you can only do so much in labs. It's crystal clear that there will not be a future consensus to roll it out unless outstanding issues are resolved, but anything with the long term aim of reducing human and bot workload is worth attempting. WFCforLife (talk)\n\nOppose Very very unnecessary. Rauenstein (talk)\n\nSupport --Prolineserver (talk)\n\nComment In case it changes anyone's views, it's worth noting that you can't view a diff on a LiquidThread. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nI don't understand what you mean. LQT allows viewing diffs of threads being edited ([3]) and allows linking to individual threads, and allows viewing individual revisions of discussions. What exactly do you mean? (Comment: I've had my main talk page using LQT for three months, and I absolutely love it. :) ) --Yair rand (talk)\n\nThat's a diff of a single comment. If there's a way to view a diff of a complete thread, I haven't found it. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nThere is no diff as such, but if you have a thread on your watchlist, new comments in it are highlighted. --Tgr (talk)\n\nOppose I do not think that the present incarnation is sufficiently mature, and offers enough benefit to warrant using it on such a high-usage wiki as this one. I also have concerns over introducing anything on a 'well, you can always disable it' type of basis, following the ongoing DRAMA re. pending changes on English Wikipedia.

This a radically, completely different user interface than the current system. This is totally different than just merely changing the skin from MonoBook to Vector. Since the Wikimedia Commons is a central file repository for all projects of the Wikimedia Foundation, I am very concerned about those who are more active in the other projects that do not have this feature yet. These users will then come here to make a comment and might have trouble trying to figure out the LQT interface. Therefore, I'd prefer to wait until more of the projects, including the large ones like the English Wikipedia, are upgraded first. Zzyzx11 (talk)\n\nComment: This seems to be a solution in search of a problem.

Also, an important part of all Wikimedia projects has always been that wiki syntax is universal, making it easy, once you get the hang of one aspect, to leap into another, thus facilitating development from commenting to editing/uploading to community involvement. LQT seems like it would create a class of commenters with no other stake in the community. I don't see that as helpful.

The current style is easier (although that may just be familiarity) and quicker, and specific long subthreads can always be taken care of by judicious use of collapse boxes now. -- Avi (talk)\n\nSupport The proposal is to enable it on some test pages.

I doubt they are very effective. They are not \"summarizable\". And there is no good way the grep them. LiquidThreads on the other hand: (1) Looks really clean. (2) Has summaries of things (e.g. counts of reply's). (3) Have the potential to be grepped. I predict that mass adoption the tool will evolve in great ways - much greater than the original discussion could. --Aleksandr Levchuk (talk)\n\nStrong Oppose - looks absolutely terrible - Wikinews EN even made a gadget for people to use so the comments pages in their skin didn't look like LQT. The main complaints were that if you wanted to remove LQT from a page, you'd lose the conversation, since there is no actual \"text\" stored in the page. It's ugly, useless, and solves as one editor has already pointed out, \"a non existant problem.\" We already have section breaks and indenting, if people learned to use them properly, conversation would already be properly threaded. Plus, it takes away the opportunity to learn how to edit in the Wikistyle. Wrong, wrong and thrice wrong. Don't do it :) BarkingFish (talk)\n\nThis vote never had a pre-set closing date, but in my opinion has run its course. Current votes: 62 Support; 49 Oppose, Total votes 111. Percentages: 56% vs. 44%. This is not near a clear consensus, so I hereby close it. — Preceding unsigned comment added by DieBuche (talk • contribs)\n\nCan we please either fix support of the TIF(F) image file format or remove it all together? I was just uploading an original image in TIF format, and it doesn't give me a thumbnail preview, which makes it pretty useless. Note that the format is not even allowed for upload on en.wiki. Nageh (talk)\n\nThe situation as you describe it, was, I think, the status quo for a long time. The TIFF files Commons' users encounter are normally very high quality versions prepared by professional scanners, and since many improvements one might like to make to an image also degrade it in some way, it is always useful to keep them so that no data is ever lost, regardless of whether or not they can be thumbnailed. A constant stream of innovation will result in improved TIFF handling, but in the meantime there's no reason to disallow uploads - that would be like a Wikipedia only accepting articles which sprung fully formed. Jarry1250 (talk)\n\nBut Nageh is right: If TIF(F) does not work properly for ages (?) we can get rid of it anyway. As for your second argument: On Commons:File types we donna have plenty of other formats, too. So better not to tempt people using TIF(F). --Yikrazuul (talk)\n\nI agree with Jarry1250. Right now, the stopgap solution is for editors, if they wish to, to upload a TIFF version of an image together with a JPEG version, and mention the link between the two files using the \"other versions\" parameter in the {{Information}} template. That way, the JPEG file is usable for Wikipedia articles and other uses, and if anyone wants to make high quality derivative versions, they can download the original TIFF file on to their computers and work on that. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThe question is, why not upload as PNG in the first place? If I had known I had done that, so now there is both TIF and PNG of the same image. Nageh (talk)\n\nWell, at least it should warn you in red color letters that TIFF is only to be used as an archival format when attempting to upload such format. Nageh (talk)\n\nThere is some merit in warning people, I think. Regarding why TIFF is used over e.g. PNG, perhaps the most obvious reason is because the TIFFs are what is supplied to Wikimedians in the first place by, for example, the LoC. They then use that version to create a JPEG (as JackLee describes). There is no simply reason to create a third format. Jarry1250 (talk)\n\nIt's also true that TIFF is a very rich format; there are features, like alternate color-spaces, subimages and JPEG compression, that PNG doesn't support, and there's a nontrivial concern that even stuff that PNG does support may not get preserved in a conversion.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nTIFF thumbnailing support is very close. Last thursday a first attempt was made to enable it on Commons, but there was an error in the extension causing some problems and it was disabled again. But it really is very close (and this has been discussed right here several times over the past 3 months) TheDJ (talk)\n\nShould be enabled again today btw. As you can see from Category:Tiff_files, at least part of the images now have thumbnails. I'm sure that this will be somewhat improved in the future. TheDJ (talk)\n\nGreat! — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nCool! Just mine doesn't display. :) Nageh (talk)\n\nTIFF is actually more of a collection of semi-compatible file formats, rather than a single unified file format, so supporting all TIFFs is suprisingly hard. AnonMoos (talk)\n\nAsked: a volunteer to rearrange somewhat the three categories: Category:Abandoned villages; Category:Deserted villages; Category:Defunct villages. --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nI'm not sure what you need help with. Can you explain? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nAre we talking merging them? I feel they all mean slightly different things. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nThe borders between the categories are not clear; I don't feel sure about how to clarify. May-be category descriptions help already. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Havang(nl) (talk • contribs)\n\nI think abandoned and deserted are pretty close in meaning, and that we should choose one or the other. Abandoned seems to be the more commonly used term, since \"Category:Deserted villages\" has only one subcategory, so perhaps we should redirect \"Deserted villages\" to \"Category:Abandoned villages\". As for \"Category:Defunct villages\", defunct just means \"not in use any more\". I think there are two ways we could deal with this. One is to make \"Defunct villages\" the parent category, since one of the ways in which a village can become defunct is if it is abandoned. The other possibility is to rename \"Defunct villages\" as \"Category:Destroyed villages\" since two of its subcategories deal with villages destroyed by war. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\n\"Deserted village\" has a certain amount of currency because of Oliver Goldsmith's poem (\"Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain...\"). Any of these names would be acceptable to me, I don't see much useful, verifiable distinction between them. I'd probably take this to Commons:Categories for discussion (tagging the categories appropriately), propose a course of action, allow a week or two for comment, and then unless there is real objection to your proposed course of action do it. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nSeems to me most defunct villages were merely dissolved, rather than abandoned. Powers (talk)\n\nAgreed. A defunct village or town is simply one that no longer officially exists, such as voting to merge with another town or simply voting to unincorporate. This is vastly different from being abandoned or deserted, and shouldn't be merged with those two. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nHi there I tried searching for how to do this but wasn't able to find the answer.

You have to download the image on to your hard disk, and upload it manually to the English Wikipedia.

They've all been verified via OTRS, but it looks to me as if they are all copyright violations. He may well have had permission to use them in his book, and have permission to host them on his website, but AFAIK, that doesn't mean he has permission to release them under a commons licence for anyone to use. Surely the original copyright remains with the artist and until this expires we can't use them? I wasn't quite sure where to bring this up, and not having much experience in this area I could be completely wrong. Could someone take a look and see if my reasoning is correct? Smartse (talk)\n\nOTRS by Leningradartist has been scrupulously checked by several experienced users from the OTRS team, and in their opinion permission that Leningradartist got from the painters is CC-BY-SA 3.0 compliant. See Commons:Deletion requests/File:Unknown-Socialist-Realism-bo47bw.jpg, Commons:OTRS/Noticeboard/Archive 8#User talk:Leningradartist. Trycatch (talk)\n\nThanks for the links, it seems pretty strange but if that's what they say then I guess they know what they're talking about! Smartse (talk)\n\nIt does seem pretty strange, and highly unusual, and perhaps suggests that he also owns the original paintings, which would deepen the COI aspect. Johnbod (talk)\n\nHi all. It seems that the (AVM) image metadata for ESA images like the one at http://www.herschel.caltech.edu/index.php?SiteSection=ImageGallery&ViewImage=nhsc2010-006a specify that the image is in the public domain; see http://www.strudel.org.uk/avm/js/ (click on the right-most image). Is this sufficient to be able to upload them here under the public domain? Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nYes, it's fine. The correct license on Commons would be {{PD-USGov-NASA}}. –Tryphon☂\n\nhttp://regex.info/exif.cgi is also a useful tool for viewing metadata, but just because the metadata says \"Public Domain\", don't believe that it really is. To the best of my knowledge, unless ESA explicitly releases an image into the public domain (and they aren't known for doing that), it isn't. (To Tryphon, just because NASA releases works into the public domain, doesn't mean this is public domain...ESA's copyright trumps that.) This is most likely an encoding error on the Caltech side of things. Your best bet would be to contact ESA directly and ask about this specific image, and specifically refer to the given credit line of \"ESA/NASA/JPL-Caltech/AURA/NSF/Univ. of Toledo\". — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nFurther, check this image with the above regex site. It has a very similar credit line (\"ESA/NASA/JPL-Caltech\") yet the metadata contains no mention of being public domain. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nThis is the NASA herschel website. Much as with the Hubble project, it is well possible that anything that the NASA Herschel center produces is PD-USGov-NASA. The data produced is PD anyways, it's about who creates the images from that data and how these images are licensed. I have sent a message to the NASA/Caltech manager, requesting clarification of the copyright status of the images that they host. TheDJ (talk)\n\nThis is the NASA Herschel Science Center website, but Herschel is primarily an ESA mission with participation by NASA and associated centers, as the website header clearly states. If an image had the credit line of \"NASA/JPL-Caltech\", then yes, it would be a form of public domain per their image use policy. (I'd actually suggest it would be more akin to CC-0, but that's irrelevant to this discussion.) As the final bullet point specifies, if another organisation has claims to an image or video, then restrictions are placed on commercial use; thus, not public domain. Since ESA is credited for that image and most others I see on the site, it is immediately rendered ineligible for upload here. Please read the Image Use Policy before making assumptions, as everything is clearly laid out on that page. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nThe image use policy wasn't linked there yesterday at the bottom. I'm positive, i looked for it 3 times, there was only a link to the privacy policy page. My request for information was yesterday forwarded to another person, I guess this link is the result of that. TheDJ (talk)\n\nI have thanked the NASA Herschel center, for adding a link to the image use policy, and informed them that we will not be using their images when ESA is credited. I have also attached a small note asking them to argue for Free works in the scientific world. TheDJ (talk)\n\n\"Thanks for asking us about this issue -- it's something that we need to get more clear on ourselves.... Gordon .... added the NASA/JPL image policy to the site.\" TheDJ (talk)\n\nHah, well I have egg on my face. I guess I was reading over that minutes after they put it up.

I'll add something in the gadget description, but maybe it can be modified to do not affect the preview button for other skins just in case someone has it enabled anyway. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nAh, that was it. It's been a while since QuickPreview stopped working for me, but I still had it enabled and it didn't have any side effects... until now. Disabling it in Preferences did the trick. Thanks! –Tryphon☂\n\n@TheDJ: the \"quickpreview gadget\" did work for me before in monobook. It showed me the preview without reloading the whole page right above the edit window. Toolbar still not the new Javascript one. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nYes this was because the toolbar was loaded under monobook, and the toolbar requires jquery, and thus the livepreview gadget worked. There is a ticket on bugzilla:25014 about the error of wikieditor. Let us hope it gets fixed quickly. TheDJ (talk)\n\nEntirely my fault, fixed now. Feel free to start throwing stones... Apparently importing jQuery when it was already there, made it not work at all, thus it falled back onto the old editbar. Sorry again --DieBuche (talk)\n\nNo stones to throw. We all make mistakes. This particular one is understandable since you would have needed the quickpreview gadget enabled in a skin other than vector (which has not worked for awhile) to even notice it. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThanks for fixing. Works again: Toolbar and QPreview. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\n@Rocket000, It even did not work when Qpreview was off, too! --Saibo (Δ)\n\nHuh? Sure it did.

The page Special:WantedTemplates is however useless because of all this MOTD/POTD templates. Is it possible to\n\nRestructure the Motd/Potd pages to not longer create all this red links? E.g. the relatively uninformativ/useless page Template:Potd/2007-03 generates 100rds of uneccesarry red template links.\n\nBypass the problem with excluding Motd/Potd templates from Special:WantedTemplates?\n\nThanks, --Martin H. (talk)\n\nIt's possible to do the query at the toolserver with these templates filtered out. Multichill (talk)\n\nI was just thinking about this yesterday. I could really use a good list to find things for my bot to work on. Multichill, would you be willing to run the query? You can drop it in my userspace (or wherever). For the long term, however, I would like to change the POTD system. Do we really need to be making a subpage for every translation of every description? A single {{LangSwitch}} for each day seems like it would be much better. I'll have to look into the current process more, but it just doesn't seem like well designed at all. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nI agree we should change our POTD system. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nMartin H. and I talked about the same topic some time ago (User talk:Slomox#Special:WantedTemplates). We didn't find a technical soluton, but I suggested that it's rather un-meaningful to have pages like Commons:Potd/2006-12 (fr) that are meant to be in French with dozens of image descriptions in foreign languages. Make the language-specific versions language-specific and we'll remove many many of the irrelevant entries on Special:WantedTemplates. --Slomox (talk)\n\nYep - I however still dont know a sollution so I think its ok to ask here again. Thanks for your input. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nThe MOTD/POTD system could be changed to only have one of each for every language. That is, one page for every day. Not even a seperate page to view it nicely and another page to edit the descriptons. But 1 page per day and in that page, something like {{ifeq:{{{view|}}}|show| show the layout with the image and description and navigation. Else just show the description (for inclusion). A LangSwitch would do the job, and something like {{Interface-lang}} to switch language. Removes a lot of clutter aswell. –Krinkletalk\n\nI uploaded a file 8 days ago, File:Itämetro-Östmetron.svg. It was uploaded quite strange, just a file without any information (even the page for the file was not created) so I created the page with the information about it. The file was visible for some time but now it has disappeared. I would like to know whether it's possible to restore the file since I've already deleted it from my computer. Stadscykel (talk)\n\nThere doesn't appear to be anything in the deletion log, nor in your deleted contribs. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nSo is there any possibility to restore the file? Stadscykel (talk)\n\nA blogger took the screenshots of this file on Monday: A screenshot of the Finnish Wikipedia with this image shown, the image itself. Stadscykel (talk)\n\nWe have been having some problems with uploads (see \"Impossible to upload files?\" above), so perhaps the missing file is related to that. I don't think there's any way of restoring the file. Where did you obtain it from? Or did you create it yourself? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nAlmost the entire file was my own work, except the coastline (including islands) and municipal borders which were obtained from OpenStreetMap. I have already created the new version and uploaded it under the different filename because it wasn't possible to upload it with the old name. Stadscykel (talk)\n\nOK, great. In future, you should be able to upload it under the old name by checking the \"Ignore all warnings\" box before clicking the \"Upload\" button. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThank you for advice, I didn't note this checkbox. Stadscykel (talk)\n\nYeah, this seems bad. Nobody deleted it intentionally according the logs which I can see, so it would seem to be a software bug or some other technical issue. That is worrying; maybe there are more? Are any backups made of media that sysadmins would have access to? Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nIn my impression -- a lot of files disappears from Commons to nowhere -- just a few recent threads: [4], Commons:Village pump/Archive/2010Jul#Problem with old picture version, Commons:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive 22#File was there on Monday, but shows 'failed upload' today, and I've seen multiple cases by myself. It's very troubling. Trycatch (talk)\n\nThat is interesting. The original, disappeared file here is still available at the URL http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Itämetro-Östmetron.svg but it's not visible on the image page (the same situation as one of the situations you link to above). Sure seems like a bug. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI've just discovered that the same thing has happened to a file I uploaded a week or so ago: \"File:YOGArtisticGymnastics-BishanSportsHall-Singapore-20100816-02.jpg\". The thumbnail caption simply states: \"File missing\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nYep same thing. It is still available at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/YOGArtisticGymnastics-BishanSportsHall-Singapore-20100816-02.jpg . Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI suppose the techies are looking into the problem? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI have no idea. I'm not in contact with them -- not even sure how. Doesn't sound they looked into the original problem much but now there are three instances. Do we file a bug, or is there a better way? Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI referenced this thread as Bugzilla:24978. Docu at\n\nThe old File:Itämetro-Östmetron.svg is at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/It%C3%A4metro-%C3%96stmetron.svg Seems that the image table entries disappear for some reason. Platonides (talk)\n\nThe file description page has been deleted as the user has uploaded another version of the file under a new name. Can this \"zombie file\" that no longer has an associated file description page be deleted? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI've been told by the good people at Bugzilla that an administrator can link http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/YOGArtisticGymnastics-BishanSportsHall-Singapore-20100816-02.jpg and File:YOGArtisticGymnastics-BishanSportsHall-Singapore-20100816-02.jpg back together again. Could someone oblige? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nA commons admin can't . It has to be a server admin. I have opened Bugzilla:25065 for that. Platonides (talk)\n\nHello. Category:Voie Verte has been created, maybe too quickly. I tried to clean it, by moving photos in the more specific subcategory Category:Rail trails in France whenever possible (former railway lines). The correct name of \"Voie Verte\" should be \"Greenways in France\", I think, but the Category:Greenways doesn't exist yet, strangely. This also supposes that all bikeways (on former railway lines) are greenways (I may be wrong)... Jack ma (talk)\n\nI guess that most (touristic) trails for bikes, horses, walking are some sort of greenways or \"Voie Verte\". Difficult to split up overlapping meanings. --Foroa (talk)\n\nAlso, \"Greenway\" (or \"Voie Verte\") is a fashionable expression. I mean, in France, you have some pure recent bikeways (former railway lines) that are difficult to share with pedestrians. But they are abusively called \"Voie verte\". Real greenways are only in cities (sharable space between bikes and perdestrians). But aa you say, maybe difficult to split up. What about renaming \"Voie Verte\" to \"Greenways\" ? (Commons category naming conventions). Jack ma (talk)\n\nMy question is simple: Why do the subcategories of Category:Police automobiles by country use the \"Police automobiles in country X\" naming format? Pretty much all subcategories of categories like this use the \"Thing Y of country X\". Examples of this include among many others categories like Category:Fire engines by country and even Category:Police vehicles by country.\n\nI propose that the subcategories of Category:Police automobiles by country all have their names changed to \"Police automobiles of country X\" format.\n\nRegards. - SuperTank17 (talk)\n\nActually, there are plenty of categories that use \"XYZ in country A\" rather than \"XYZ of country A\". I don't think we've agreed on any standard yet. In makes more sense in some contexts (such as police automobiles, perhaps), but of (or from) seems more appropriate in others (people, for instance). — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThe way I understand it \"Police automobiles of country X\" means all police automobiles manufactured by that country (or at least vehicles upon which they are based) as well as police automobiles used by the police force of said country while \"Police automobiles in country X\" means all police automobiles photographed within the borders of that country regardless where they were manufactured or what police force operates them. Because of this I think that \"Police automobiles of country X\" is a much better naming format considering for what these categories are used for. Regards. - SuperTank17 (talk)\n\nI was thinking the opposite -- that most people would be looking to see what police vehicles look like while in use in (say) France, rather than what police vehicles made in France (and possibly shipped elsewhere) look like. Powers (talk)\n\nJust to complicate things several areas have multiple police forces. It would be more sensible for the vehicles to be broken down by force/department. Dor instance in Liverpool you can find British Transport Police Port of Liverpool Police w:Mersey Tunnel Police and occsional w:MOD Police.--JIrate (talk)\n\nI agree that regardless of the in/of discussion, it should be harmonised in its family, so \"Police automobiles of xxx\". Anyway, most (if not all) police vehicles are customised/painted in the local country, so in and of are both correct. We cannot differentiate where the vehicles are customised, assembled, designed, commercialised, receives its main parts from (chassis, engine), ... Many police vehicles point to a specific basic car model, which on its turn points to the manufacturer and some (vague) country of origin. --Foroa (talk)\n\nI agree with Foroa that as far as possible there should be consistency within a particular parent category. In addition, given the vagueness of terms like from, in and of, editors should try and be clear as possible when they name categories, and add usage notes where necessary. For example, SuperTank17's example \"Police automobiles of country X\" would not have naturally suggested to me that the category was for automobiles manufactured in country X. It would be better to name the category \"Police automobiles manufactured in country X\", which is completely unambiguous. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nIs there a template or a way to create a scrolling panorama out of a wide jpg? LoreMariano (talk)\n\nHi Lore, the English Wikipedia uses Wide image for this, is that what you have in mind?--Eloquence (talk)\n\nGreat! Yes, this is what I was looking for. Thanks much. 68.46.20.249\n\nSeptember 5\n\nShould all European and Mediterranean photochroms be tagged with {{PD-Switzerland-old-unknown}} or a variant tag? The consequences:\n\nIf yes, the copyright claims of so far unidentified original photographers might be ignored. Given that most of the photographs were taken before 1900, the number of those cases is assumed to be small.\n\nIf no, most photochroms (a few thousand?) with European and Mediterranean views need to be moved to en.wiki.\n\nA lengthy discussion of the copyright situation can be found above, a summary is at Category:Photochrom pictures from the Library of Congress. Please don't anyone comment that \"they are from the Detroit Publishing Co.\", \"they are PD-US\", or \"but the LOC says...\". Thank you. ~ trialsanderrors (talk)\n\n{{PD-Switzerland-old-unknown}} seems fine --Jarekt (talk)\n\n{{PD-Switzerland-old-unknown}} with possibly an additional template mentioning the slight uncertainty. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nA specialized license tag would make sense in any case. Just to be clear, by applying {{PD-Switzerland-old-unknown}} we're essentially creating a rule that says if the images is from before 1900 and we don't know the photographer, we assume PD internationally. ~ trialsanderrors (talk)\n\nI don't see any problem with that, because they should be PD in the US anyway, as they're older than 1923. --PaterMcFly (talk)\n\n{{PD-1923}} is quite explicit that it's insufficient for Commons, and {{PD-US}} doesn't apply because it doesn't originate in the U.S. ~ trialsanderrors (talk)\n\nI made a DEMO WIKIVIEWER with all images of the demo-category full-screen; as it is done manually, i had to save the content, but it should be made a temporary display, to be generated by a toolbox-item, which makes it also return to normal when leaving the category page. I like to have this, not for maintainance purposes, but especially as a visitors-friendly gadget, which permits to not have to click for each individual image to show full-screen. Is the community interested and if yes, who is willing to programm such a toolbox-gadget? --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nI can't really see myself using such a tool, but you could try asking DieBuche as he seems to be quite good with programming. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nSeptember 2\n\nDo we have a problem tag for files that do have sources but the sources are either not working or problematic? Several of Corpx's uploads cite the forum Shaggybevo and Flickr as a source, however it seems the forum can't be searched unless one is registered, making it difficult to verify the images and copyright status (linked topics also don't display), and the Flickr sources don't point to the images in question. E.g.,\n\nFile:Longhorn snuggie shaggybevo.jpg\n\nFile:Reesing warmups shaggybevo.jpg\n\nFile:150x-34585-3.2.7 Hall tn.jpg - seems to be an invalid source\n\nBrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nIt is a common problem. Major websites disappearing or moving to new locations, people pulling images from webpages with temporary links ( I have seen links which seem to be defined by as record number ...), images from discussion forums, etc. There is not much we can do about it. We can tag it, by a template, but I am not sure if there is any action we should perform to correct it. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSadly, the first two cases are \"no permission\", mails should be sent to OTRS, photos on flickr are CC-BY-ND licensed. Third thing... I think DR would be appropriate. If some photo was found on a government website, it doesn't mean much. The very same Marines.com hosts the famous photograph \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" without any credit of Joe Rosenthal, for example. Trycatch (talk)\n\nI just noticed that the permission is stated as \"granted to upload here under CC 2.0 license through correspondence through site PM,\" hardly a credible means of verifying the author's license. These 2 have been tagged. The 3rd I tagged as a speedy since it looks like an NFL photo. BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nIf you see images from an external source, {{LicenseReview}} is your friend. This way we know someone trusted reviewed it (just like {{Flickrreview}}). Multichill (talk)\n\nHow would I flag images that could use this review to the right attention? BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nIf it is not from Flickr etc. you can just add {{Flickrreview}} and then someone should have a look at it. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nMake that {{LicenseReview}}. :) Rocket000 (talk)\n\nI've gone through and tagged several more images that were sourced from the forum and state that the permissions were granted by the authors via PMs and chat messages. However it looks like this issue affects many more of the uploads. Does this require admin review of all this user's uploads? BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nAdmins or license reviewers. If an image has a source but the source doesn't indicate that it's freely licensed or has contradicting terms, you can mark it as missing permission. There's a gadget you can turn on in your preferences called \"Quick Delete\" which will make this really easy to do. If you come across a user that has many questionable uploads (like 10 or more), you can make a mass deletion request instead. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nMDR here. BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nSeptember 4\n\nI created a picture file named: File:Ellen Reiss I also created a second file, because the first one was not linking to my article, called: File:EllenReiss (thinking the space had something to do with it not working). Neither file shows in a search, but if you try to create a file with that name, it will prompt you with a duplicate warning.\n\nI created another file, last night, using the same licensing, called: File:Congressional Auditorium which works fine.\n\nI would appreciate any help someone can give me as to why the File:EllenReiss isn't working. Is there sometimes a lag in indexing?\n\nThanks. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nCan you please provide links to the images you tried to upload? You can type them like this: \"[[:File:Ellen Reiss.jpg]]\". Without the actual filenames, it is very hard to try and figure out what went wrong. Your contribution history doesn't show that you uploaded any files called \"Congressional Auditorium\", \"EllenReiss\" or \"Ellen Reiss\". Did you upload them here (at the Commons), or some other Wikipedia project? Also, what is the name of the article you were working on, and which Wikipedia project is it at? Again, I cannot find any English Wikipedia article called \"Ellen Reiss\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThanks for your help! I am making quite a few corrections on an article, and have it posted on a test page: [[5]] You'll see the Congressional Auditorium picture at the very bottom of the article; and you'll see the placeholder for the picture of Ellen Reiss. I used this link to create the picture files: [[6]] and named the uploaded files: EllenReiss.jpg and Ellen Reiss.jpg. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nJust realized the Congressional Auditorium picture has the date on it.\n\n[[7]] LoreMariano (talk)\n\nThe problem is that the file is not found:\n\nFile:EllenReiss.jpg\n\nFile:CongressionalAuditorium_10-21-2009.jpg LoreMariano (talk)\n\nWell you uploaded them locally on the English Wikipedia, so of course they're nowhere to be found on Commons. The correct links would be en:File:EllenReiss.JPG, en:File:Ellen Reiss.JPG (notice the capital letters for the extension) and en:File:CongressionalAuditorium 10-21-2009.jpg. If you use the correct filename in your article (i.e. [[File:EllenReiss.JPG|thumb|left]], with capital letters), then it should work just fine. –Tryphon☂\n\nLoreMariano, it looks like you were not the person who actually took the photographs of Ellen Reis and the performance in the Congressional Auditorium. Are you able to contact those persons by e-mail and get them to confirm by e-mail that they are the copyright holders of the photographs and are willing to license the images to the Commons under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 licence? If so, the e-mails can be submitted to OTRS for confirmation, and we can transfer the images to the Commons. (Also, since \"File:EllenReiss.JPG\" and \"File:Ellen Reiss.JPG\" are duplicates, I have nominated EllenReiss.JPG for deletion.) — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nJust to clarify, if the extension is typed in lower case, the File macro looks to Commons and if it's typed in uppercase, Wikipedia? Can you tell me why it's better to upload to Commons over Wikipedia? (Obviously, I didn't know I was doing that. Retracing my steps, I now see that that the \"simple form\" link I clicked on was to the Wikipedia form.)\n\nThank you for tagging the duplicate for deletion. You are correct in describing the fact that I uploaded the 2 pictures taken by different authors. Thank you for the OTRS information. Is it okay to license under CC-BY (use with attribution)? I just sent the authors emails with that information (instead of using CC-BY-SA). I hope that's okay.\n\nThank you both so much. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nNo, it is not the way the extension is typed that makes the difference whether the file is loaded from the English Wikipedia or the Commons. The software is designed to look for a file first at the local Wikipedia project (say the English Wikipedia) where the article is located. If it finds a local file, it will display that file. If it does not find a file by that name at the English Wikipedia, then it will look for a file at the Commons and display it if it finds one. Filenames are case sensitive, including the file extensions. If you have uploaded \"File:Ellen Reiss.jpg\" at the English Wikipedia and another file \"File:Ellen Reiss.JPG\" at the Commons, and refer to \"File:Ellen Reiss.JPG\" in your English Wikipedia article, the Commons image will be displayed, because \".JPG\" is not the same as \".jpg\".\n\nIf an image is uploaded to the Commons, then any Wikipedia project can make use of it. If it is uploaded only to, say, the English Wikipedia project, then someone from the Portuguese Wikipedia cannot refer to that image. She would have to download a copy to her hard disk and upload it to the Portuguese Wikipedia. That's why we encourage freely licensed images to be transferred to the Commons. Yes, CC-BY-3.0 is fine. If you need help obtaining OTRS confirmation or transferring the images to the Commons once authorization from the copyright holders comes through, just post another message here. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThe thing about the upper/lower case has nothing to do with where you uploaded the file. It's just that the system is case-sensitive, so if at upload time you used capital letters, you need to use the same capitalization when you use the file (unlike on a Windows system, where filenames are case-insensitive and filename.jpg refers to the same file as filename.JPG). –Tryphon☂\n\nOK, now I understand it. Thank you for the explanations. I hadn't thought about sharing with other projects, but you never know! The two people--Amy Dienes and Donita Ellison--sent their permissions to OTRS. Once the new files are made, will you swap out the old Wikipedia pictures with the new Commons pictures? LoreMariano (talk)\n\nDid you forward the e-mails to permissions-en wikimedia.org or permissions-commons wikimedia.org? If you didn't send them to the latter e-mail, I suggest that you do so. I've transferred the images for you to the Commons and tagged them with {{OTRS pending}}, so please mention in your e-mail that the images are in the Commons as \"File:Ellen Reiss - 20050815.jpg\" and \"File:The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg\". In future, you can transfer the files from the English Wikipedia to the Commons yourself using CommonsHelper. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nGreat. The permissions were sent to Commons and the addendum note from each person (stating the filename) will be sent shortly. Again, many thanks. (PS Thx for CommonsHelper too.) LoreMariano (talk)\n\nI am amazed that the filenames take commas and spaces. Good to know. Thank you again for all your work in helping me get it into shape. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nSpaces are always equivalent to underscores in file names. AnonMoos (talk)\n\nCan someone help me out with editing the description of the file: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_People_of_Clarendon_County_at_The_Congressional_Auditorium,_US_Capitol_Visitor_Center_-_20091021.jpg\n\nThe description should read: \"The People of Clarendon County\"—A Play by Ossie Davis, & the Answer to Racism, presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.\n\nThis is an important correction as the current description sounds like the photo is of the play only. I tried to use commonshelper but did not know what TUSC login/password was. Apologize for asking. If someone tells me how to edit, I can do it myself. Thanks. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nOK, I see now that it's editable in much the same way any wiki page is editable, by section. I was looking for a link to replace the version, which is unnecessary. Thanks everyone for your help. LoreMariano (talk)\n\nI choose the wrong file and uploaded a file .TIF instead of a normal .JPG. (File:Harkeberga kyrka M03.tif). I see that .TIF also is accepted, but I would like to have all in .JPG. Shall I do something about it? (i.e. beg for deletion and upload a new jpg-version?) --Xauxa (talk)\n\nSure, just tag your TIFF file with {{Speedydelete|1=Accidentally uploaded TIF file instead of correct JPG file.}}, then upload the correct JPG. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nThanks for your advice, I will do that. --Xauxa (talk)\n\nMy deletion request was not accepted. Well, it does not matter too much;-) --Xauxa (talk)\n\nSeptember 6\n\nIf anyone's looking for some work, here's a list of file pages that don't have a single template. No license tag or anything. All the ones I checked had info removed or sections blanked after upload. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nOr google translation was used resulting in (( this )) or { { this } }. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nAh, I wondered why that was happening. It's kinda weird that Google translates even the stuff in textboxes and changes brackets into parentheses. I'll try an do a bot run to fix what I can. If it's just changing (()) back to {{}} it shouldn't be problem. Thanks for helping. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nRegretably also the {{Information is now (( Información and the |source= is now |fuente= and so on, in various languages. Dont know if this is so easy to fix with a bot. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nYes, unfortunately, I can't do much by bot. However, there wasn't that many. I searched for \"((\" and fixed the ones I found. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nVery nice, thank you! --Màñüé£†¹5 talk\n\nYes, that list is very useful. I randomly chose File:Orna002-Bandmotive.png and noticed it belongs to a set of many scans from the same book in Category:Meyer's Ornament. Those pages used to have the {{PD-Ornament1898}} template but over the years actions of well-meaning bots and editors have resulted in quite a few without the template. Could someone change that template so that it becomes useful again? -84user (talk)\n\nFiles 151 to 239 are scanned from the Meyers Blitz-Lexikon, and used to have {{LA2-Blitz}} which has since been removed. These images appear to be in some kind of copyright limbo. Should we re-add {{LA2-Blitz}}? -84user (talk)\n\nWhy was the copyright tag removed? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThere was no edit summary to explain the removal, maybe the editor was confused by the auto-categorising behaviour of the template? I have been slowly re-adding them inside {{Information}} templates. -84user (talk)\n\n84user, if the license template has been deprecated as invalid in the U.S., perhaps the associated files need to be deleted rather than the template simply readded? — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nI'm not sure how Category:Clubs and societies, Category:Clubs and Category:Societies should relate - I'd be inclined either to get rid of the first or to keep it and make the latter two into subcategories - but right now there is a circular mess. Does anyone else want to weigh in on how best to sort this out before I make changes? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI share your concerns. To me, a club is a more narrow form of a society, which is used more in the context of a (people) association, not a real society which can be anything from a small company to a population of a continent. Maybe associations is a better word. Don't know but \"Clubs and societies \" sounds wrong to me.--Foroa (talk)\n\nPls see Special:Contributions/DRBot. regards. --JuTa (talk)\n\nIt appears these monthly pages are not automatically created. At least the one for August wasn't. I've now manually created the remaining ones for this year. Lupo\n\nI'm not sure why this category accretes so many logos that have nothing to do with the programming language. I've kind of manually semi-cleaned-out the category once or twice before, but I don't feel like doing so again now... AnonMoos (talk)\n\nWell, the reason most likely is, that if you use the category selector on the upload form and type in \"logo\" the first entry (\"Logo\") is highlighted in blue and nothing happens if you click it. If nothing happens people assume that the highlighted entry is not part of the selection menu and they try the next entry in the list which is \"Logo (programming language)\". --Slomox (talk)\n\nSeptember 9\n\nI've noticed that a common problem with files moved from the English Wikipedia to Commons is, the Information template gets filled out with useless information from the transfer. For an example, compare this original Wikipedia file File:Earheart 1928 to this newly-created Commons file.\n\nMany times, when I try to fix one of these, I find the original Wikipedia file has already been deleted, leaving a very-unhelpful file description at Commons.\n\nIt seems that the transfer bot needs rethinking. At the very least, it should be modified so as not to fill the Info template with nonsense. And a stronger warning NOT TO DELETE the original file, without carefully checking the Commons daughter-file, might also help. TIA, PDTillman (talk)\n\nIt looks like the file description page here is at least missing a \"1=\". You might want to ask Magnus to add that.\n\nI'm not entirely happy with the entire process either, but we haven't really come up with a better solution yet. - Docu at\n\nadding \"}}\" helps. As it stands, CommonsHelper can only be used to \"assist\" a transfer. The editor needs to review content. It remains useful. Finavon (talk)\n\nIf you find deletions on en.wp that are not appropriate, do try to point them out to the deleting administrator. If you don't point out errors that people make, they cannot learn. And there are usually a few enwp admins online on IRC chat if you need something from a page. TheDJ (talk)\n\nMore importantly, explain to the editor who carried out the transfer that he or she needs to ensure that the transferred image needs to be properly described and categorized. I've come across cases where editors appear to have transferred masses of files but have not bothered to tidy up the descriptions or categories. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nWhy the bot can't just transfer full verbatim description from wiki? (and hide it in collapsible block) This information generally is very important. It's not normal that you need to search an admin from source wiki for such trivial actions. Trycatch (talk)\n\nAs far as I am aware, CommonsHelper usually does. It could be that now and then a character that it doesn't expect gives it indigestion. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI added the \"1=\". Docu at\n\nHmm, for example, here essential information from the original wasn't transferred. Trycatch (talk)\n\nTemplate:Зображення might be confusing the bot. Docu at\n\n#1 issue with CommonsHelper: |Author = Original uploader was...\n\nSorry, those aren't the same thing, bot. For licenses that require attribution, nming the uploader doesn't fulfill this (even if they are the same person, you still aren't given them the required credit if you only refer to them as the uploader). Rocket000 (talk)\n\nActually, Docu, is the \"1=\" in {{En}} really necessary? I have not been using it and it doesn't cause any problems. In wikitext generally, parameters like \"1=\" can be omitted as it just means the first value in the template (i.e., \"{{en|1=XYZ|2=ABC}}\" is identical to \"{{en|XYZ|ABC}}\").\n\nRocket000, when transferring files from the English Wikipedia to the Commons, I usually check who the author of the image is, and if it is the same as the uploader I remove the words Original uploader was. I guess this just re-emphasizes the point that the editor effecting the transfer must make sure that the Commons {{Information}} template is properly filled in. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nGive it a try. Docu at\n\nThe \"1=\" format is only equivalent if the template parameter doesn't contain an equals sign. {{en|1=2+2=4}} and {{en|2+2=4}} don't do the same thing. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nI came across File:Finally 360.jpg and added the template {{Pano360}}. Trying the result, I did not get any image; the screen remained blanc. Trying on an other image of which I knew it had worked, the same result. What can be the reason? I work with Firefox 3.6.8. Wouter (talk)\n\nI'm using 3.6.8 as well and it works fine. Neither low res nor high res pano works at all for you? You don't even see the loading screen? — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nI see the loading screen with the words \"full resolution - This image on commons, Other panoramics\", but further loading of the pano360 image does not happen. Changing from full to reduced resolution does not help. Wouter (talk)\n\nTry re-installing Java. That is what runs the 360 tool. The page also mentions that you might need to increase the Java heap space, but I have no idea how to do that in Firefox. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nI tried with Safari and there it worked for the reduced version (not the full version). It appeared that in Firefox Java Embedding Plugin 0.9.7.2 MRJ Plugin version 1.0-JEP-0.9.7.2 was not made active. Changing that gave the same result as with Safari. Wouter (talk)\n\nThat matches with what I see. I couldn't get the full resolution to work since I'm not sure how to increase the Java heap space. If that is increased, the full res should work as well. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nMy husband and I went to Lynmouth for a holiday this year and we walked through the gorge and embedded in the wall was a pipe with the name ATTREE which is our name.

See \"Can you help me ?\" above. (By the way, don't forget to sign your posts with four tildes, like this \"~~~~\".) — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI made a comment above at #Special:WantedTemplates but I guess that thread's life cycle of attention is expired. So I start a new one.\n\nWe have several overview pages for our pictures of the day and media of the day (like Commons:Potd/2004-11 (de)). These pages contain a big number of links to non-existing descriptions and they thus mess up Special:WantedTemplates.\n\nI suggest that we either unify the different language versions like Commons:Potd/2004-11 (de), Commons:Potd/2004-11 (fr), Commons:Potd/2004-11 (en) etc. into a single page Commons:Potd/2004-11 and use our common template localisation techniques to make them multilingual, or that we make the language-specific subversions monolingual (that means that Commons:Potd/2004-11 (fr) will only show the French translations but not the English, German, Afrikaans etc. pp. ones).\n\nOpinions, objections, other proposals? --Slomox (talk)\n\nInstead of having a separate description template for every language and every day (e.g. Template:Potd/2010-02-21 (en), Template:Potd/2009-11-02 (it)) why not just have one for each day with a langswitch or something? Then we could easily have multilingual month pages like Commons:Potd/2004-11. The whole thing can be drastically simplified. I'm ready to do some work on this. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nTo get an overview of available translations for one month, one page that displays them all at once is quite useful, e.g. (the current version of) Template:Potd/2010-08.\n\nIf there are additional pages for various languages, e.g. Template:Potd/2010-08 (zh-hans), maybe they needn't include translations. BTW, there is currently no Template:Potd/2010-08 (en)\n\nThere is some advantage of having a summary of MOTD/POTD for one month (even if I don't use it), but I'm not sure this needs to be combined with the page for translators.\n\nThe way languages are displayed on the file description pages, e.g. at File:Saint-Maimbœuf_church.jpg#Assessment, is - IMHO - quite useful. Docu at , revised 07:07, 4 September 2010 (UTC)\n\nIn that case, we can use something like {{Mld}}, so we can display all languages if we want. For translators, I agree it's useful to see them all at once, but we don't need separate month pages for each language. For the things that are different, like the calendar at the top and captions on the images, we can use {{LangSwitch}}. Actually, I don't think the captions are even necessary since all the descriptions are right next to it. Maybe we should just create a header template that changes based on the interface language, and the rest would be the same in any language. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nJust to add some clarification. Pages like Commons:Potd/2004-11 (de) add to the problem, but the main troublemaker is Commons:Picture of the day for the overview over current POTDs/MOTDs (and its corresponding pages like Commons:Bild des Tages).\n\nI was thinking about the most unobtrusive solution to the problem but I cannot come up with a good solution. The easiest solution I can think of is to change Template:Potd and Motd/Languages and change it so if the parameter \"lang\" is fixed it will display only this one language instead of all of them. That should immediately change almost all of the pages. But I'm not sure to what degree people want to have the full lists. The full lists could easily be replaced by e.g. a Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Potd/2010-09-07 link. --Slomox (talk)\n\nWell, I changed it now. We'll see how long my edit lasts. If I have luck nobody ever cared about the full lists and the next update of Special:WantedTemplates could be useful again. If I have no luck, I have to look for another solution. --Slomox (talk)\n\nCool, let's hope it stays that way. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nSpecial:WantedTemplates works again! Have a look and fix! --Slomox (talk)\n\nGood work. Still a couple of POTD and MOTD, but, for once, quite a few others! Docu at\n\nI recently had to clean upp the clutter and I discovered File:Prinztronic 300IM.jpg. I placed it under the category calculators. However there seems to be no category \"Vintage calculators\" and there are lot of missing subcategorys. But before we create such a subcategory: what is vintage? (Trademarks no longer used or a cuttof date?)\n\nI dont find any category Dixons and by the category displays I couldnt find a correct one. The \"Vacuum fluorescent displays\" is the closed one, but there also modern displays in that one.Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nAnd do we have categorys such as \"Made in Taiwan\"? If this is usefull?Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nAs you pointed out, I think categories with names like \"Old\" and \"Vintage\" are slightly problematic in that if the terms are not defined in a usage note, it becomes uncertain what sort of images should be categorized in them. Compare \"Category:Old maps\", where a decision was made to consider maps as \"old\" if they are more than 70 years old. Of course, for electronic equipment like calculators a shorter period would be appropriate. As for categorizing images of objects based on their place of origin, you could use a suitable subcategory of \"Category:Objects by country\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nYou could start a category:Calculators with LED displays. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nI have looked at the categorys, but I find a lot of unclear definitions: Wat is the difference between calculators and computers? For me calculators are handheld devices that are only active with human interaction.(input) But I am no expert. Another unclear category is:Sinclair Research. What is the link with research? Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nFrom the English Wikipedia: \"A calculator is a small (often pocket-sized), usually inexpensive electronic device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic.\" On the other hand, computers perform many more functions than just arithmetic. Sinclair Research is the name of a British company that produced some of the early personal computers in the 1980s. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nHow do we treat US wax museum sculptures? Are they considered sculptures that are subject to FOP? A DR was recently raised that poses this question, so I'm curious. BTW, this wasn't intended to draw attention to the DR, but is a general question. Thanks. BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nThere is no FOP that sculptures are subject to in the US.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nActually there is. I've nominated numerous contemporary American statues for deletion on those grounds. BrokenSphere (Talk)\n\nI think you're both saying the same thing - in different ways. Prosfilaes is saying there is no freedom of panorama for statues in the U.S., he's not saying there is no Commons policy about freedom of panorama for statues in the U.S. Wknight94 talk\n\nAnd just so folks know about it, there's another DR on the same issue at Commons:Deletion requests/Wax figures in the United States. And yes, I'm still waiting on hearing back from the Madame Tussards folks about getting clearances... Tabercil (talk)\n\nIn revision #72349, the scripts like wikibits.js and the like have been moved to the bottom. Since I know how much Commons relies on JavaScript, I was wondering if we could live like that or if that might break stuff, so we'd have to somehow rewrite it. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nUhm what? I'm not sure I fully understand teh implications. Among many other things wikibits.js defines addOnLoadHook, which is used by probably almost every script. The change is going to break them all? --Dschwen (talk)\n\nIs the concern that, since the .js files have been moved to the bottom, that stuff higher up might take precedence from them? I didn't think that js files had the same problems that css files did. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nAs far as I understand it, all javascript will be run from the bottom of the page. So the load order will be the same as always. Only if you have an extension that is adding JS in an unconventional way before wikibits, there will be a problem I think. So for most people there shouldn't be a noticeable difference. TheDJ (talk)\n\nThe Resource Loader is still under development. My understanding is that most of the Javascript will be moved to the bottom (so that it doesn't slow down page loading). However, I believe there are a few components (such as global Javascript variables) that are likely to get moved back up to the head before the Resource Loader is deployed. As it stands in the current trunk code, a good many scripts on Commons would probably be broken, but there is work ongoing to make it more backwards compatible. Kaldari (talk)\n\nOk, thanks for clearing that up. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nMore info at [8]. Kaldari (talk)\n\nThe link \"Upload a new version of this file\" which is displayed on every file page does work in misleading way which causes frequent improper overwriting of files. The upload form misses an accentuated warning that new file has to be uploaded under a new name and that an overwriting of a file by another one is inadmissible, excepting minor technical corrections of the original file. The form contains quite misleading entry (related to the upload of new files and not to the upload of a new version) and a misleading field \"licensing\" which is ignored when uploading. Could somebody urgently fix this lapse? --ŠJů (talk)\n\nActually this is also an issue for users who think it is the link to make licensing and source changes. When a file is tagged with {{Nsd}} or {{Nld}}, many uploaders attempt to add them using the \"Upload a new version of this file\". I see it often when cleaning the backlogs. ZooFari\n\nFrom Bugzilla:13802: \"There should be a __PANORAMA__ (or __LANDSCAPE__, whatever) magic word specifying that a category contains very wide images. This would then allow MediaWiki to optimize display. Instead of say 6 images per line with thumbnail dimensions \"120 x 35\", it would have one thumbnail per line, perhaps \"800 x 235\".\"\n\nJust wondering what you think of it? It would allow specific different thumbnail sizes for categories such as Category:Panoramics. -- Docu at\n\nHaving more control over the display of thumbnails in category pages would of course be helpful.

It uses the GNU licence even when we use material from it, the information is written in Arabic in there website [9] under the paragraph Uses of Marefa Material. My question is, can I upload in Commons media (pictures, videos) from that encyclopedia?\n\nI give you 2 examples, here is a picture originally from Commons [10] but taken in Marefa and then modified (translation of brain parts names in Arabic) [11]. The other case is a picture probably from Marefa itself (So under GNU Free Documentation License). [12] --Helmoony (talk)\n\nIf they use GNU license (I can not verify it) than the files are OK to transfer. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThks, and what should I add in the upload page specially Licensing blank? --Helmoony (talk)\n\nIf the image is a derivative of an image originally on Commons, the licensing of the original image would typically apply, so {{Cc-by-2.5}} for the brain example. Otherwise, they would be under {{GFDL}}. By the way, I don't see any licensing info or credit to the original artist (Patrick J. Lynch) for the brain image on Marefa. I don't read Arabic, however, so maybe I'm just overlooking it. Kaldari (talk)\n\nThks, its much more clear now! As it is written in the english article of Marefa (Knowledge in Arabic) in wikipedia (Marefa), they do not explicitly state that the content they use is under GPL (=GFDL ? is it the same thing). If we take the example of the brain. Normally they should cite Patrick J. Lynch for credits but they don't, for licensing info you can see below the page a little sentence underlined at the right it says in Arabic that « As stub, Marefa has used articles from allowed sites like Wikipedia and Kuwaiti Al-Arabi magazine content that are available under GNU Free Documentation License. See Marefa: about » [13]. All the website uses the same method for media files. Can I make an upload and then tell me if it s done with the wright way? It will be much more simple to know how to manage the file.. --Helmoony (talk)\n\nIs it the wright way for that kind of uploaded files ? Plz take a look on the image [14], because I'll use the same method for other files. --Helmoony (talk)\n\nLooks good except that the editor parameter in {{RetouchedPicture}} should just be a name, not a URL. Kaldari (talk)\n\nThank you, now I think I can upload and respect commons licences. Thank you. --Helmoony (talk)\n\nSeptember 10\n\nI'm not sure if this has been done before, but I've just made a Commons search plugin for Firefox. Hopefully this is of use to someone. Cheers. sonia\n\nCool, but there were some long before. ;-) Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nSeptember 11\n\nI have written some questions on talk:Categories but since the response there is slow I am trying here also. The question is about when there are two persons with the same name. Should those two corresponding categories for those persons be contained in a supercategory explaining that there are several persons with that name. I'm thinking of something similar to haw Wikipedia articles are made when there are several topics with the same name. With the example I'm thinking of there would be one category named \"Joakim Berg\" containing links to two categories \"Joakim Berg (Kent)\" and \"Joakim Berg (Hardcore Superstar\".\n\nThe other option would be to just have the two categories \"Joakim Berg (Kent)\" and \"Joakim Berg (Hardcore Superstar\" and no supercategory.\n\nAnd I also need help renaming the current category \"Joakim Berg\" to \"Joakim Berg (Kent)\".\n\nRegards Averater (talk)\n\nI responded there.
