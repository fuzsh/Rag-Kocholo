TL;DR, there is an NGO sponsoring translating high quality articles between Wikipedias. But on EN due to our COI/PAID policies they are required to use AfC, which means that their articles, which usually are very good, are delayed through AfC backlog, to which they also contribute. I think this is an excellent initative that however needlessly clutters AfC due to our current rules, and I'd like to suggest we consider giving it exception from the COI requirement to use AfC. It makes sense to direct paid-for spammers to AfC, as their articles are often problematic (notability, etc.) but what we have here is very different (translations of good quality articles from other wikis - ex. current drafts include Draft:Renaissance in Ferrara, Draft:Spa Conference (2-3 July 1918), Draft:Formal procedure law in Switzerland, etc.), yet this stuff is caught in the same \"COI\" net. (See project page linked above for links of articles already published, links to drafts waiting for review, and their instructions to translators) Thoughts? (Courstesy ping project founder @7804j). PS. A question to 7804j - how are articles chosen for translation? How is the system designed not to be abused by spammers? Perhaps if an exception is granted on en wiki, it should not apply to articles about companies, products or living persons? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI would dispute that \"this is an excellent initative\" or \"that their articles, which usually are very good\". They have caused a lot of work; mostly these are machine translations by people whose English is rather poor. The titles chosen are often completely ungrammatical (Greek Classicism Sculpture was a typical one) or inappropriate, & in the past they have chosen often subjects we already have. The texts are just whatever the language taken - usually Portuguese, Spanish, French or Italian, has on their wiki, & the quality of the original is often poor, & errors introduced by machine translation go uncorrrected. There have been numerous complaints. They have got slightly better, but I think still don't publish a full list of articles they have paid for, whicgh they should. The Open Knowledge Association isn't really \"an NGO\" - as far as I can see it's a single Swiss guy with a bit of money to spend, who you have rashly decided to endorse. Johnbod (talk)\n\nI think that the principle is sound: high-quality articles can and should be translated into languages where they're missing. Doc James ran a similar program for certain medical articles a few years ago (e.g., during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks), to public acclaim. However, he was working with pre-screened professional translators, and OKA seems to have struggled with quality control. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nUnfortunately the ODA model makes absolutely no attempt at quality control. As will be clear to anyone who reads one of them, they are just machine translations dumped onto en:wp with no aftercare. Many that were forks were just turned into redirects, which the ODA doesn't appear to have noticed. The ones that are left take a lot of cleaning up, when some regular editor can be bothered. Johnbod (talk)\n\nI am afraid that your anecdotal analysis above is different from mine. The articles from OKA I've seen seem pretty decent, at start+ class, and would survive AfD if nominated. Can you recall which articles were redirected - and prove that they are a rule, and not an exception? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nWhether they would survive Afd is almost all about the notability of the subject, and that is not usually an issue - the quality is. In fact the worst issues arise when they tackle very prominent subjects. I never claimed that redirected ones were the \"rule\" - I make no attempt to search out OKA efforts, but then clearly neither do you. Draft:Crow-stepped gable is a recent creation, objected to, for which we have a redirect already in place. Not much of it will survive, I'd imagine. If they kept proper lists of their articles on wiki I would be able to find some, I imagine. Johnbod (talk)\n\nJohnbod List here; may not be everything. Mathglot (talk)\n\nThanks, but I don't think that is at all complete. The template was only set up in October 22 (by 7804j), well into OKA's project. Stuff may have been added later. You used to able to access an off-wiki spreadsheet 7804j maintained, but I can't see that you can now. User:7804j? For example, the earlier efforts of User:Racnela21, one of the most prolific OKA editors, are not templated - see the 48k bytes of Brazilian Romantic painting (typically, initially called Brazilian Romanticism Painting). Johnbod (talk)\n\nThis list contains all articles created by OKA after the template was created. Oka was created relatively shortly before the template was created, therefore there are not many articles without it (probably 90+% have the template). The off wiki tracker is still at oka.wiki/tracker 7804j (talk)\n\nAlso, I'd like to highlight that quality is not really the topic of this discussion, since this is about whether COI should require all paid editors to go through AfC and, as you pointed out yourself, AfC's goals are not primarily to check quality. I'd suggest moving the OKA discussions somewhere else such as our talkpage in the intertranswiki project 7804j (talk)\n\nPiotr brings up \"would survive AfD\" because that's the standard AfC uses. If OKA articles typically have quality issues that wouldn't be enough for deletion, then there's no point insisting they go through AfC – assuming reviewers are doing their job properly, they'll just send them right through. – Joe (talk)\n\nThings that would make them fail Afd include repeating articles we already have under a different title, a perennial problem with OKA, which reviewers don't always pick up, but sometimes do - as currently at Draft:Crow-stepped gable. Besides, some reviewers (perhaps not \"doing their job properly\" - how shocking) insist on minimal standards of coherent English, etc. Johnbod (talk)\n\nHealth translation efforts from English to other languages are still running. Wiki Project Med Translation Dashboard Our translators are mostly volunteers with a mix of Wikipedians and professional translators. Doc James (talk · contribs · email)\n\nHi Piotrus,\n\nThanks for initiating that discussion! I am fully supportive of such an exemption, as I see this AfC requirement as additional red tape that consumes a lot of time for OKA translators and AfC reviewers.\n\nOur core principle is that our translators are free to work on anything that interests them. We provide them with a monthly stipend, some training on how Wikipedia works, but we then see them as volunteer contributors on whom we impose some process to ensure they do not abuse the grant and provide overall value (eg, quality checks, quantity checks). To help them find articles to translate, we curate an optional backlog (at oka.wiki/tracker). Articles of this tracker primarily consist of \"Featured\" and \"Good\" quality articles from other Wikis, as well as red links from these articles. We also complement this with articles that we find important, eg, about geographical features such as lakes, mountains, etc. The broader principles for articles prioritization are described at oka.wiki/overview\n\nNote that there was a similar discussion in the Interwiki talkpage, which can provide useful additional context.\n\nRegarding Johnbod's response, I would like to bring 3 points of context:\n\n1) While overall quality is good, it may vary. Because we have many different translators, with difference levels of experience, the quality will not be uniform. We are providing them with training, and we have observed their quality improved over time. We stop providing grants to translators wjth recurring quality issues. Overall, I do not agree with Johnbod's characterizarion of a high degree of quality issues. Often, the issues raised with OKA's work were not due to the quality of the translation, but because of the source article itself. We have published several thousand of articles, most of which are still live with very minimal change vs their original published version.\n\n2) This discussion is not about assessing the quality of the work, but whether the COI requirement to go through AfC should apply to OKA. The only reason why our translators go through AfC today is because of the COI policy, which was not created primarily to check quality of paid translations but to eliminate bias. Therefore, I don't think such arguments are appropriate in the current discussion.\n\n3) Our funding comes from many different private individuals, but it is true that currently I am the main donor. That being said, this should not make any difference as to whether we can be called an \"NGO\". Would the Gates Foundation not be called an NGO just because most of its funding comes from Bill Gates? We have over 15 full time translators who agree to do this work with a very small stipend, much smaller than what they could earn in a regular job, so the work of OKA is much more than that of a single person 7804j (talk)\n\nPersonally, I don't care how high quality the articles end up being, if you have a financial tie to a subject you should go through AfC. Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs)\n\nGetting paid to translate an article about Brazilian Romantic painting (popular in the late 1800s) is not exactly the same as having a financial tie to the subject. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI would prefer not to couch any action in terms of \"an exception\" for a named user or group. Rather, I would prefer to see an adjustment to WP:PAID to make a modification to allow \"philanthropic paid editing\" where the articles in question and the content added are chosen by the paid editors and there is no oversight by the payer. At that point, individual articles and editors would be subject to the same kind of oversight as any other. It seems to me that philanthropic paid editing to expand the encyclopedia is within the scope of WP:HERE, and this should not be formulated as an \"exception\" as if something were wrong with it in the general case. Mathglot (talk)\n\nI agree with [[U|Lee Vilenski}} if you have a financial tie to a subject you should go through AfC, The given example Draft:Renaissance in Ferrara is very poorly translated. Theroadislong (talk)\n\nCourtesy ping: Lee Vilenski. Mathglot (talk)\n\nBut that's the thing, OKA editors don't have a financial tie to the subject. They're paid by an organisation to edit Wikipedia, but the selection of topics is independent. It's basically paid editing without a COI, which is a bit of blind spot in our current policies. – Joe (talk)\n\nIndeed. What \"tie to the subject\" is there in \"Renaissance in Ferrara\"? We might as well call COI and PAID for Wikipedia:School and university projects or most of WP:GLAM stuff, and various edit-a-thons, since there is $ involved in it as well. Do we require AfC from Wikipedians in Residences? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nActually I would be interested to understand what are the requirements for projects such as the ones you mentioned to *not* qualify as paid editing. As you pointed out, Wikipedians in Residence do not need to go through AfC -- what are the formal criteria/policy allowing them to be compensated without being considered paid editors? 7804j (talk)\n\nAs per foundation:Policy:Terms of Use/Frequently asked questions on paid contributions without disclosure#How does this provision affect teachers, professors, and employees of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (\"GLAM\")?, Wikipedians-in-residence are still considered paid editors for contributions for which they are being paid. isaacl (talk)\n\n@Isaacl:, yes, but as I read it, they are free to make edits of their choice without even disclosing their paid status, as long as they are not making specific edits about the payer institution. The way I read it, is that GLAM employees do not need to disclose because: \"Disclosure is only necessary where compensation has been promised or received in exchange for a particular contribution\". That section recommends a simple disclosure for W-in-residence, but only in the case where they are \"specifically compensated to edit the article about the archive at which they are employed\". Paid status need not be disclosed for general edits unrelated to that. Do you see it differently? Mathglot (talk)\n\nYes, I do, and so has previous discussion at Wikipedia talk:Paid-contribution disclosure. If they are being compensated for a particular contribution, as per the section you quoted, then they fit the definition of a paid editor. :foundation:Policy:Terms of Use#Paid Contributions Without Disclosure does not distinguish reasons for the paid contributions. isaacl (talk)\n\nYes they do fit it if compensated for a *particular contribution*, and the Paid FAQ linked by the foundation Policy you cited above specifically calls out the circumstances when paid editors do *not* need to disclose their contributions. Those circumstances match those of paid OKA volunteers, who, had they been a Wikipedia-in-residence or a GLAM-paid instead of OKA-paid, would not have had to disclose their status, according to the wmf policy FAQ itself. Mathglot (talk)\n\nOn the English wikipedia we do require that disclosure \"If you receive, or expect to receive, compensation for your contributions to Wikipedia, you must disclose who is paying you to edit (your \"employer\"), who the client is, and any other relevant role or relationship.\" Even if the foundation FAQ says that per the foundation they don't per English wikipedia they do. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThe FAQ is giving specific examples, and is non-exhaustive. As explained in the first paragraph of the section, you are only required to comply with the disclosure provision when you are compensated by your employer or by a client specifically for edits and uploads to a Wikimedia project. This is in accordance with the actual Terms of Use: if you are being specifically compensated for contributions, you are a paid editor, but this does not extend to your contributions that are not within the scope of your compensation. If you are being paid to edit about your employer, that's within the scope of your compensation, and so the relationship has to be disclosed (and the example is about this specific situation). isaacl (talk)\n\nSo in the same line of thought, this means that all articles created by Wikipedians in Residence in the context of the organization that pays them need to go through AfC (as @Horse Eye's Back suggests in the comment below), is that also your understanding? 7804j (talk)\n\nNote that \"Wikipedian-in-residence\" is just a self-described title, without any oversight from anyone involved with the WMF or Wikipedia, so the scope of their role is entirely decided by their employer and them. Some of those who have participated at Wikipedia talk:Paid-contribution disclosure have said that they do not edit Wikipedia as part of their role; they provide education and support to the institution's staff. isaacl (talk)\n\n\"Do we require AfC from Wikipedians in Residences?\" The outcome of the recent case involving the BYU library's Wikipedians in Residence clarified that the community does in fact expect Wikipedians in Residence to use AfC. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n@Mathglot \"philanthropic paid editing\". I like the term - hope it makes it into our updated policies. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nThis is one reason I prefer the term financial conflict of interest. \"Paid editing\" focuses on a transaction—being paid to edit—but the real issue is the tendency to bias created by some financial relationships. Wikipedians in Residence are the paradigmatic example of people who are literally paid to edit but don't have a conflict of interest; it seems like OKA translators are another. If we shifted the guideline to talk about FCOIs instead of paid editing, the need for an exception for philanthropy would disappear. – Joe (talk)\n\nHear, hear. There is nothing inherently wrong with folks making $$ out of volunteering. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nBy definition you can't make money out of volunteering, if they're making money they're working not volunteering. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nIf you can make xxx$ out of a full tims job and only half of that when editing Wikipedia, it becomes more a hybrid role than pure full time job. Our translators usually give up much better paid opportunities for being able to work on Wikipedia. 7804j (talk)\n\n7804j, I would not pursue this line; it's a distraction, and a loser. Volunteering/working is binary, there is no hybrid, in-between, or threshold of payment so low that it is not \"working\". Mathglot (talk)\n\nIn the context of Wikipedia I agree with you that there should be no distinction in the policy. I just wanted to call out that many of these paid editors do so not because they are interested financially but because they care about Wikipedia and just need some money to pay rent and food (thus why we call it a grant/stipend). Sometimes people are being overly harsh on them, so I think it's important to highlight they also do some personal sacrifices to do that job. 7804j (talk)\n\nIndeed. And WiRs get paid stipends and such, and we still consider them volunteers, no? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nWe consider WiR and such to be paid editors if they are paid (there are volunteer WiR who don't get any compensation). Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nYou seem to be making the distinction between working full time and working part time, not between working and volunteering. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nNo, I am making the distinction between working full time in a for-profit translation company that pays well, and working full-time through stipends from a non-profit organization like OKA that pays a lot less. OKA editors accept a much lower grant than what they could earn elsewhere because they know it's an important cause. 7804j (talk)\n\nAnd what is the distinction? Neither of those is a hybrid situation or volunteering... Taking a lower salary to work in a job you want to work in vs one which pays more but you don't want to do is not volunteering, almost all of us do that. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nWikipedians in Residence all have signficant conflicts of interest, primarily in relation to their employer. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nEveryone has significant conflicts of interest, primarily in relation to their employers. The issue is whether they make edits in those areas or not. If a WiR at the Museum of Nowheresville was editing Museum of Nowheresville, there'd be a problem. If an OKA translator was editing Open Knowledge Association, there'd be a problem. But that's not what we're talking about here. – Joe (talk)\n\nNot able to square \"Wikipedians in Residence are the paradigmatic example of people who are literally paid to edit but don't have a conflict of interest\" with \"Everyone has significant conflicts of interest, primarily in relation to their employers\" Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nSo OKA has been on my radar for some years now due to off-wiki reports sent to the paid editing queue. I was extremely suspicious of it at first and (along with others active in UPE patrolling) worried it would be a sort of front for the usual abusive paid editing. However, I have to hold my hands up and say that it's been c. five years and nothing like that has come up. From what I've seen, the selection of topics is genuinely made based on what's missing on enwiki, and the quality of the translation are at least no worse than average. @7804j: You perhaps made an initial strategic error in structuring/talking about this as \"freelancers\" doing \"paid editing\", because this puts you in a category of people that the volunteer community, for good reason, have come to be very sceptical of. Essentially identical activities that are framed as grant-making or residency do not raise the same eyebrows, especially if you can get some sort of buy-in from the WMF (which is not hard).\n\nQuality is a separate issue and something that pretty much always causes friction when people who aren't very familiar with Wikipedia are incentivised to contribute to it en masse. There is no easy to solution to this. Specifically, making them go through AfC isn't going to help – AfC reviewers don't have the time to do a close reading of drafts to look for translation issues. They'll take a look through for major problems (which OKA drafts don't seem to have) and for notability (virtually guaranteed because these are substantial articles on other Wikipedias) and then pass it through. So we'll end up with the same outcome as if they were created in mainspace directly, just with some extra volunteer time wasted within an already backlogged process.\n\nAs to whether OKA creations need to go through AfC, I am usually the last person to point this out, but technically this is a request not a requirement. AfC is broken by design because generally we don't want to encourage paid editors by giving them an efficient route to publication, or encourage volunteers to do work that someone else will get paid for. As Mathglot says, Neither our COI policy or the AfC process was designed with 'philanthropic paid editing' in mind. I think it's fine for OKA editors to bypass this and create directly in mainspace. This isn't an exception our a change to the rules, it's just applying WP:IAR and recognising that forcing good faith creations into a broken process because their creator got a stipend while writing them, or because they might have some translation issues, is not in the spirit of WP:FCOI. – Joe (talk)\n\n@Joe Roe \"extra volunteer time wasted\" - exactly, this is the problem I am trying to address. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nThanks @Joe Roe!\n\nInitially, I also thought that the AfC requirement for paid editors was a request and not a requirement. However, @Seraphimblade raised in my talk page that any OKA editor creating an article in the mainspace without going through AfC would be blocked. Hence why we started requiring all our translators to go through AfC since early May.\n\nI agree with you that it was a mistake from my end to have initially used the term \"freelancer\". Our translators are volunteers receiving a grant to cover basic costs of living (~400 usd per month for the ones working full time). Going forward, I will make sure to always use the more accurate terms of \"Grant/stipend recipients\". I did not want to use the term of \"Wikipedians in Residence\" as it seemed to me that this requires that the work be related to the institution itself. I wasn't aware that there are options to get buy-in from the Wikimedia foundation, but I will explore this avenue as it will indeed help with acceptance of OKA among the community.\n\nIn general, I strongly with the idea of introducing a broader exemption to the AfC requirement of the COI policy to either philanthropic institutions that do not target specific topics and give high degree of freedom to grant recipients, or to payments that are too low to represent full wages (e.g., <xxx$ per month/ per hour).\n\n7804j (talk)\n\nSpecifically you might want to look into meta:Wikimedia thematic organizations or one of the other categories of meta:Wikimedia movement affiliates. – Joe (talk)\n\nWhatever avenues you explore, I would not get into proposals related to trying to find a threshold where a payment is \"too low\" to make a difference, and thus presumably not trigger a PAID concern. Experience with paid crowd-sourcing platforms such as MTurk shows that micropayments may attract volunteers for certain tasks, even sometimes for a larger than average task such as a translation. Mathglot (talk)\n\nThis might be a dumb question, but I'm tired and can't find it: where in the policies do we require paid editors to use AFC? (please do not ping on reply) Primefac (talk)\n\nWP:COIEDIT states that paid editors \"should put new articles through the Articles for Creation (AfC) process instead of creating them directly\". Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI see. Primefac (talk)\n\nAh, so here's this month's OKA thread, I thought I'd miss it!\n\nIf an organization of this sentiment really wanted to help the English Wikipedia, they would be working exclusively on poorly developed vital articles. Then there would be no AFC necessary. The English WP is far past the point where creating new articles is an effective way to make meaningful improvements. Unless, of course, this creation targets areas of systemic bias where there is a genuine dearth in coverage.\n\nTo me this appears much like the organizers have gone so far in one direction that whether or not their effort is actually worthwhile is no longer a consideration. Even with their current infrastructure, it would be considerably more effective to take EN FAs and translate them into other languages. Aza24 (talk)\n\nYou've created 68 articles, the last one two weeks ago. Are we to understand that that was the last one we needed? – Joe (talk)\n\nHalleluyah, we are done! Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nThe English Wikipedia does not need new articles nearly as much as it needs improvements on existing ones. As I said, the only exception is to fill systemic bias gaps, which yes, includes a woman poet! Comparing a single editor with an entire organization does not track.\n\nUnfortunately, the OKA is fundamentally flawed in this regard, but it doesn’t seem like an object of concern for them. Aza24 (talk)\n\nI should add that if I'm being overly critical, it's because this organization should be held to a high standard. Sine it is under the guise of effective altruism, the former \"effective\" qualifier needs to take more prominence. I can't see anywhere that it's even been considered how to most effectively help Wikipedia. Otherwise, the OKA would have approached the community before founding, to identify what is actually needed. Since they didn't, now we find ourselves in these same threads, time and time again. Aza24 (talk)\n\nYour argument appears to be about your opinion on how work on Wikipedia ought to be prioritized, and is a red herring. One of the central features of a volunteer organization, is that volunteers work on articles of their choice, not articles of your choice, or some committee's choice. Thank goodness I didn't have to listen to you, or I never would have had the opportunity to translate that article about a medieval Catalan peasant uprising, when there were no doubt many hundreds of thousands of tasks more urgent than that one at the time. The OKA volunteers who translate articles of their choice in their own manner should be held to the same standard I was, namely, Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and nothing else. Mathglot (talk)\n\nThank goodness I don't have to listen to you either! Aza24 (talk)\n\n@Aza24 I do not think this is the right place to discuss this. This thread is about whether to make changes to the AfC requirement of COI, not about how OKA prioritizes articles. So I would suggest moving that discussion for example to the OKA taskforce talkpage.\n\nThat being said, we (OKA) already operate along the lines of what you seem to recommend. Many if the articles our translators work are are about neglected topics in EN wiki, for example, articles about geographical features of non-English speaking countries (eg, Spain, Latin America) or non-English speaking historical figures. I would actually argue that improving coverage on these topics is much more important than extending already extensive articles on important topics. But most importantly, it takes different skill sets to translate vs expand articles. The editors who receive our grants would not necessarily be sufficiently familiar with these topics to be able to expand them starting from scratch.\n\nRegarding your recommendation to translate from English to other languages: we do that already. We published thousands of articles in the Spanish and Portuguese Wikipedia, with a strong focus on under represented topics in these Wikipedia such as mathematics, computer science, etc. There's been a lot of off Wiki analysis of opportunities to maximize impact on donation that went on before we decided to set up OKA the way it is, and I'm happy to share more detail about the rationale if there is interest 7804j (talk)\n\nI'm going to retract my comments. Given your response, I don't think I'm nearly as informed as I should be on the organization to be casting such aspirations/critiscms. Also, my comments seemed needly inflammatory; my apologies. – Aza24 (talk)\n\n@Aza24 I just wanted to say that it is quite rare to see folks backtrack and even apologize in Internet discussions (and that includes on Wikipedia). Regardless of the issue at hand, I would like to say I very much respect and appreciate you for what you have just said above. Cheers, Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nHow did feline hyperthyroidism come up then? Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nI see a nescessary delay, there is no rush and that absolutely needs to be treated the same way as other paid edits. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nTranslator here. I stumbled across this group a couple of months ago. I was well into remediation of an article when I began to wonder who had created the thing -- something I normally care about not at all -- and discovered it was an OKA editor. I talked to the coordinator and was told that the editor in question was one of their best, that the editor was a really nice person, and the quality of the English was not really an issue, since nice people like me would fix things up. Oh, and I was just jealous because I was not myself getting paid.\n\nI am far from a snob when it comes to English, and in fact spend most of my time on Wikipedia instilling readability into the work of subject matter experts whose English is not as good as they think it is, or who have not realized the problems with machine translation. For the most part consider it a good use of my time. I dropped the article after that remark though; I don't appreciate my pro bono efforts being taken for granted in anyone's business model. The article was inane as I recall, and seemed hastily written. Copy-editing is analogous to image editing. In the same way that you can't bring out pixels that aren't there, you can't add meaning to vague generalities; it requires research and at that point you are re-writing. More bytes does not equal more information necessarily, or even very often. The WP:PNT translation project essentially drowned in MT bullshit and this project is only a more subtle incarnation of the same problem.\n\nI vehemently oppose removing the little quality control there is now for these articles, and we really do not need more of them.Elinruby (talk)\n\nHi Elinruby,\n\nI assume the conversation you are referring to is this one? I don't think you are making a fair characterization of that discussion. As I responded in that thread, I completely agree that the improvements you made to the article were great, but I think one needs to make the distinction between \"Improving the English\" vs \"Improving the overall writing\". Sometimes, the English is correct but the writing can be improved (e.g., shortening of sentences that are too long). People with native English may still sometimes make poor sentence constructions. Of course, both the quality of the English and of the writing are important, but I was just saying that the two concepts are orthogonal. And if the sentence construction of the original article was poor, it makes it also harder for translators to resolve these in the translation, hence why sometimes it gets missed; but when someone flags our article on these grounds, we go back to it and improve them. In any case, these type of issues will not be caught through the AfC process.\n\nI have never implied that you were \"jealous\" of the fact they are paid. In that thread, I had just asked whether your judgement of the work would have been as harsh if the editor was a volunteer rather than paid. 7804j (talk)\n\nOf course you don't, and the answer is still no. I would not. I constantly clean up good articles in bad English because it is helping someone to share their knowledge, and I applaud the sharing of knowledge. I stick up for editors that other editors are trying to get blocked on CIR grounds because of their English, and to the best of my ability encourage such editors to contribute where they have a competitive advantage, ie where their knowledge of another language matters. I would, for the record, applaud your concept, in theory. But having been up close and personal with its products, I have to say that the quality is so poor that it literally would be easier to simply pay these people for the article topics they identify, then have someone else do the writing. That an article can be so bad it is better re-started from scratch is a concept I loudly poo-pooed back in the day of CTX. I hereby recant my then-assertion that nothing could be that bad. I will however stick to my guns on the weird concept that turning CTX off fixed anything at all. It is a useful tool when properly used, like all machine translation. I say this as someone who went though *all* of the flagged material with DGG and S Marshall. What was lacking in the CTX debacle and is still lacking today, as we see, is a sane workflow for translations, one that involves some quality control and does not massively penalize anyone who attempts to clean up a translation. As for whether you said the word \"jealous\" in that particular venue -- whatever. I seem to recall more than one conversation, as I was quite perturbed to discover than in your mind I was working for you.\n\nI am not claiming that you engaged in personal attacks, just explaining one of several sorry episodes that made me stop trying to fix machine translation. I merely report that you did not seem able to understand that I think that if anyone is going to pay anyone for anything at Wikipedia it should not be for creating ever-increasing piles of dreck. Those piles are what we have now, not solely because of you of course, but you are adding to them using the same badly broken system, where incomprehensibly translated articles may or may not get flagged and may or may not go to WP:PNT, where as far as I know nobody works on them at this point. Sending them back to the original writer is a laughable solution btw, and this is true of AfC in general. Anyway. AfC is not very good-quality control, it's true, but it is *some* quality control. We could perhaps have a conversation on what could be done better, but as I told you then, it is important to realize that I am not available to clean up after you. I have much more interesting things I am trying to clean up, and this is true of most other wikipedia editors. Elinruby (talk)\n\nFor the record, I am jealous of folks being paid to do wiki work (more than I am, as my work, to some degree, already involves some peripheral interaction with Wikimedia...), and I do wish I could write for wiki as a full time, salaried job. And I do not mind saying so - and still supporting this project :P Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nIn many ways I wish you could too, Piotrus. I would btw support your students not having to go through AfC if you were willing to vouch for the results. We have had this conversation before about content creation. But this is another instance of you supporting the wrong people, perhaps for the right reasons, imho. Elinruby (talk)\n\nFYI almost no education projects use AfC; it is not required and it is cumbersome and too backlogged to be reliable in a setting with deadlines. I actually have data on that (as in, data supporting the claim most educational project use sandboxes, not draft space), from my research into the educational and Wiki stuff. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI believe Piotrus is correct, but to put some numbers on it, I have raised this at ENB. Mathglot (talk)\n\nI agree that paid editing is fishy due to the presence of inherently non-encyclopedic motivation, which may ultimately lead to poor quality translations of selection of poorly referenced source articles. As I see, OKA is fairly new and it is probably not flooded with quick buck seekers, but things may quickly change when rumors spread on how to earn some extra easy cash off google translator. I took a quick look at OKA articles submitted in AfC and all my random picks seem to have good quality. So here is my suggestion: How about vetting decent contributors to bypass AfC? - Altenmann >talk\n\nI could see creating some sort of “fast-track” for reviewing these articles, but some sort of review is still necessary. If for no other reason than preventing duplication of topic with existing articles. Blueboar (talk)\n\nI could get behind a separate lane so to speak, I just really dislike the idea of creating a loophole. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nHEB, Can you expand on what you mean by the idea of \"a separate lane\"? I wouldn't favor a change that referred to OKA by name (except at best in an explanatory note as an illustration of a general point in line that requires an example). Plenty of generalized guidelines have logical carve-outs that need to be explicit, for example, the guidance that strongly discourages external links in the body of an article specifically states that it doesn't apply to inline citations. We could follow that approach.\n\nBut there may be even a better way to deal with this. Currently, the first line of WP:FCOI says this:\n\nBeing paid to contribute to Wikipedia is one form of financial COI; it places the paid editor in a conflict between their employer's goals and Wikipedia's goals.\n\nIn my view, this is the crux of the problem, because it *assumes* that an employer's goals are in conflict with Wikipedia's goals. But what if that is a false assumption? I believe the general problem we are addressing could be handled without any specific carve-out, by altering it as follows:\n\nBeing paid to contribute to Wikipedia is one form of financial COI; it places the paid editor in a conflict when their employer's goals and Wikipedia's goals differ.\n\nIf the goals of an organization do not differ from Wikipedia's goals, then no separate lane or carve-out is required elsewhwere. This somewhat leaves open the question of what we would define as Wikipedia's goals, but Wikipedia:Purpose (info page) says this:\n\nWikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia; a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge. ...\n\nThe goal of a Wikipedia article is to present a neutrally written summary of existing mainstream knowledge in a fair and accurate manner with a straightforward, \"just-the-facts style\".\n\nIf a philanthropic organization's goals are the same as Wikipedia's, and there is no organizational oversight of payees' output, then it seems to me no special lane is required. (edit conflict) Mathglot (talk)\n\nThe practical question is who's going to decide which edits do or do not need independent review? If in practice this can only be done on an article-by-article basis, then I don't think much is gained by setting up a new decision branch that comes before using the articles for creation process. isaacl (talk)\n\nThe lane or whatever isn't me idea so I don't want to speculate on it, in general I think what we have now works. In terms of the hypothetical unless they themselves are wikipedia how can their goals be the same as Wikipedia's? Generally organizations have self promotion as a goal and that is forbidden per WP:PROMOTION. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThe organisation's goals may be the same but the individual's goal may be to try and make as much as money as quickly as they can which can lead to machine translations + quality issues, which I've notice in the one OKA article I came across. Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nThat could be a problem if the payment model is Piece work, but it's unlikely to be a problem with a set monthly stipend. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThe New Page Patrol process should already cover most of the review requirements, no? 7804j (talk)\n\nQuestion: do we actually have some specific consensus that these uniformly awful translations should in fact be submitted through AfC? That would be such a good thing! Every one of them I've seen so far (mostly relating to horses) has been created directly in mainspace, and requires an amount of clean-up that seems to be far beyond the editor resources we have – with the result that overall this project is making the encyclopaedia worse, not better. I've asked myself several times why these pages were not being submitted as drafts, but not until now seen any discussion of them; if there's an standing consensus that they should go through AfC, I'll be draftifying several of them in the near future. Sorry, but oppose any kind of AfC exemption for the moment. Justlettersandnumbers (talk)\n\nJustlettersandnumbers, First: imho, you should draftify them regardless, if they are not ready for mainspace, not because there is or isn't some guideline stating that they should all go through Afc. Secondly, do you draw a distinction between awful translations produced by paid translators and awful translations produced by unpaid translators that go straignt into mainspace, and if so, what criteria should be used for each? Granted, the former are easier to find due to categorization. Mathglot (talk)\n\nI think enough concerns have been raised about poor translations here that the argument to skip the AFC process is quite weak. I will also add that unedited machine translations are an extreme drain on experienced editor time, resulting in diffs like this one from 2021. If unedited machine translations are occurring here, this could turn into a big problem and big cleanup effort, and once sufficient evidence is gathered, we should attempt to communicate these concerns to the event organizers. –Novem Linguae (talk)\n\nI've seen no evidence that OKA translators are creating unedited machine translations. – Joe (talk)\n\nSounds like @Johnbod (mostly these are machine translations by people whose English is rather poor) and @Theroadislong (Has this been machine translated? There seems to be a lot of mangled content here? in Draft:Renaissance in Ferrara) might disagree. –Novem Linguae (talk)\n\nIndeed - 7804j has never denied that these are machine translations, and they normally appear on en:wp in a single edit, & are not edited further except for a couple of tidies. There is no evidence that they are edited machine translations when OKA bow out, and they should be treated as \"unedited machine translations\" - what other evidence of absence would there actually be? Other volunteers are left to do things like categories and links, which they normally lack. Very rarely does anyone do the complete rewrite that ones like Draft:Renaissance in Ferrara need just to be comprehensible to an average English reader. To anyone who think OKA texts are \"generally good\" or \"decent translations\" I would say: just try actually reading that one - which btw will probably get far more views than most OKA efforts, as there is a real topic there. It covers our existing School of Ferrara but that is so crap I don't object on WP:FORK grounds, though it is typical that OKA haven't addressed this. Johnbod (talk)\n\nI think you're applying a really high standard here. For example, the original title of Brazilian Romanticism Painting, and yes of course that's not perfect English, but does it impair the reader's ability to understand that the article is about Romanticism in Brazilian art? No. I see the same kind of thing reading through the rest of the article and other OKA articles: uneven English, yes, but perfectly comprehensible and, more importantly, sourced encyclopaedic content. The rest will be ironed out with time, like how you corrected the title of Brazilian Romantic painting a couple of weeks after it was created.\n\nIt's actually quite easy to verify whether a machine translation has been edited or not: just run the original through the same translator. For example, here's how DeepL handles the first paragraph of the first section:\n\nThe Este court in Ferrara was one of the most vital in northern Italy from the end of the 14th century, when Niccolò d'Este started the university and initiated the construction of the castle[1]. The courtly connotations were pronounced, as evidenced by the interest in the world of fairy tales of medieval heritage, as evidenced by the numerous novels of chivalry that enriched the famous library, in astrology and esotericism[2]. On an artistic level, Pisanello, who produced various medals for Lionello d'Este, was highly appreciated, as was the illuminated production, both of an international nature, in which Belbello da Pavia (author of the Bible of Niccolò d'Este) stood out, and updated to humanism, such as that of Taddeo Crivelli (Bible of Borso d'Este)[2].\n\nCompare that to the draft:\n\nThe court of the Este in Ferrara was one of the most vital in northern Italy since the late 14th century, when Niccolò d'Este funded the University of Ferrara and started the construction of the Castello Estense.[1] His courtly features were prominent, as evidenced by his interests in the fable world of medieval heritage, astrology and esotericism. On the artistic level, Pisanello, who produced several medals for Lionello d'Este, was highly regarded, as was the illuminated production of both international in which Belbello da Pavia (author of the Bible of Niccolò d'Este) stood out, as well as update to humanism, such as that of Taddeo Crivelli (author of the Bible of Borso d'Este).[2]\n\nAgain, it's not perfect, but it's not somebody just acting as a conduit for automated translations, which is what the practice of draftifying these is supposed to filter out. OKA editors are using a machine translation as a base and then proofreading it, which in my experience is what practically everyone that works in more than one language does these days. – Joe (talk)\n\nNot sure what you think this demonstrates. It could be that they used a different translator. If you are suggesting they used the same one, then manually touched it up, the effect of their changes has on the whole made things worse, no? To someone who doesn't know the area, both versions of the passage are basicly gibberish in the details. To bring either up to even mediocre WP standards, a total rewording is needed. This is typical (ok, this example, which Piotrus selected, is worse than most of theirs these days). Johnbod (talk)\n\nIncluding estabilished and experienced editors like myself. (I machine translate and proofread my own articles between en and pl, for example). Nothing wrong with using MT as long as one knows how to proofread stuff (and if the original article of course is of decent starting quality to begin with). Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nThe draft as it was first submitted was:\n\nThe court of the Este in Ferrara was one of the most vital in northern Italy since the late 14th century, when Niccolò d'Este funded the University of Ferrara and started the construction of the castello Estense[1]. His courtly features were prominent, as evidenced by his interests in the fable world of medieval heritage, evidenced by the numerous chivalric novels that enriched his famous library, in astrology and esotericism[2]. On the artistic level, Pisanello, who produced several medals for Lionello d'Este, was highly regarded, as was the illuminated production of both international in which Belbello da Pavia (author of the Bible of Niccolò d'Este']) stood out, as well as update to humanism, such as that of Taddeo Crivelli (Bible of Borso d'Este)[2]. That is substantially identical to the unedited machine translation. JoelleJay (talk)\n\nSee Feline hyperthyroidism\n\nDeepl translate of the German lead gives me: Feline hyperthyroidism is a disorder of the endocrine system in domestic cats (feline, adjective from the Latin felis \"cat\"), which is characterised by hyperthyroidism. It is the most common hormonal disorder (endocrinopathy) in cats over ten years of age, whereas hyperthyroidism is much less common in other pets. The disease is often characterised by weight loss despite increased food intake, is usually detected by blood tests and is easily treatable.\n\nI believe the whole article is probably just a straight up machine translation. Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nNovem Linguae, one of the points of this discussion, I believe, is that there is a difference between poor translations in general on the one hand, and translations by paid OKA editors on the other. Can you confirm that the translations in your 2021 link above as added to Cemetery of San Fernando were from OKA editors? Because if they weren't, everyone, I think, is in agreement that there are very many poor translations by new editors. The question at issue here is whether that applies to OKA editors as well, to such a degree that Afc is necessary for their contributions. Mathglot (talk)\n\nCan you confirm that the translations in your 2021 link above as added to Cemetery of San Fernando were from OKA editors? They were not OKA editors. That link is just a generic example of how much work machine translations are to clean up. –Novem Linguae (talk)\n\n@Justlettersandnumbers: I'm not sure if you're asking about this specific case or translations in general. If it's the specific case of OKA, it sounds like you've found a bad run of horse-related translations, but myself and others have seen a lot of decent translations from them too. The reason some are asking OKA translations to go through AfC is because they're paid for them, not because they're translations.\n\nIf you're asking whether there is community consensus for draftifying poor translations in general, I'd say the answer is no. Unedited machine translations are fair game (a legacy of the WMF's failed experiment with auto-translation, I believe), but if it just needs copyediting then draftspace will not help. AfC reviewers don't routinely do anything about translation issues, as long as it's a viable article. Instead there's the {{Cleanup translation}} family of templates and an active patrol that deals with them in mainspace. – Joe (talk)\n\nThe WMF has never attempted to do anything with auto-translation. They accidentally (and briefly) enabled exactly the sort of \"machine translation as a base, but then proofread it and clean it up\" system that many good editors use themselves, from Spanish to English (only that language pair) here, and then turned it back off when the error was pointed out to them.\n\nIn the meantime, one (1) editor dumped a bunch of unedited Spanish mis-translations in the mainspace, and we panicked and created Security through obscurity restrictions on all editors ever since. Which is to say: I can, and have, used machine translation to English in the Wikipedia:Content translation tool, but most editors, including those with far better translation skills than me, won't be able to figure out how to do that on their own. In the meantime, most editors are pasting the contents into machine translation in another tab, and thereby screwing up links, templates, categories, and formatting. Anyone who's been paying attention will know that this is typical of our community. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\n@WhatamIdoing Indeed. My students do translations for class assignments, and I often tell them not to bother with the official Wiki translation tool because it doesn't work due to the reasons you discuss (i.e. their work can't be easily published). Then, of course, they struggle with code etc. eating our class time, so instead of having let's say a discussion about free culture or such I have to spend time doing activities about how to add hyperlinks or templates or such. On the bright side, they eventually learn the code, at least some of it. But it is still embarassing that I have to tell them \"don't use the official tool, it is not friendly enough\". Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nYes, that's what I was referring to. A promising tool that was killed by a botched deployment – typical of the WMF in that era! – Joe (talk)\n\nIf you are referring to Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/CXT, then your summary is extremely misleading, as it was about the extremely poor translations from many editors, with that Spanish editor as the most visible example. But upon rereading that discussion, I see that you were trying to muddle the waters and defend the indefensible by providing wrong numbers there already, so I guess hoping that you will change now is rather useless. Fram (talk)\n\nI moved Draft:History of Caraquet back to draft space yesterday. It would be nice if such articles didn't start with presenting speculation by one local amateur historian and genealogist as if it was accepted truth, even though it disagrees with nearly all actual historians and the available evidence. The remainder of the article isn't much better. Fram (talk)\n\n@Fram What policy allows you to draftify such an article without consulting the community? I believe AfD is the only acceptable option (or perhaps PROD/CSD if not contested). Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nWP:ATD, why? The topic is probably salvageable, the article is largely rubbish, so the paid editor can make sure they write a decent article which at least follows accepted science, instead of blindly copying what another Wiki has produced. Fram (talk)\n\nI do not see draftification listsed as an acceptable ATD. Sure, the article needs various fixes, but I don't see why they cannot be done in the mainspace. If you think it should not be in the mainspace, we need a community consensus (i.e. through AfD) on whether it should be de-mainspaced. Single editors do not have the power to delete (hide) articles - this is a task we relegate to the community (outside CSD-level garbage) and this is hardly at that level. See also WP:DRAFTNO. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI see it listed under incubation: \"Recently created articles that have potential, but do not yet meet Wikipedia's quality standards, may be moved to the draft namespace (\"draftified\") for improvement, with the aim of eventually moving them back to the main namespace, optionally via the articles for creation (AfC) process...\" (the whole incubation subsection is actually about draftification, incubation and draftification appear to by synonyms... Maybe we should just use one term as it seems to be causing confusion?) Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nBefore the Draft: space was created (late 2013), that section of the deletion policy was talking about the Wikipedia:Article Incubator. Before the Wikipedia:Article Incubator was created (in 2009), we moved such articles to the creator's userspace. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThe problem is the ambiguous \"Wikipedia's quality standards\". Some AfC reviewers seem to decline anything that's not GA-level ready. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\n\"Wikipedia's quality standards\" does not mean GA and I don't think you will find a single editor who will publicly say that. If an AfC reviewer is doing that on the DL then bring a case against them and get their privilages stripped, someone being an abusive jerk isn't the wording's fault its the absusive jerk's fault. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nWe do have a mismatch between the mainspace's actual standards and what it takes to get an article out of AFC. For example, we had a chat last week about why \"too short\" was listed in Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Reviewing instructions as a reason to decline an article. We agreed to change it.\n\nLooking at 10 recently accepted articles, the Page Size gadget shows a median new article accepted by AFC is around 400 words. A quick visit to Special:Random indicates that the median Wikipedia article (most of which are not new, and some of which are very well developed) is less than 200 words. I don't think that AFC should be expecting the typical new article to be twice the length of established articles. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\n@Horse Eye's Back I've seen some articles declined, by various reviewers, where I am sure those articles would not be draftified or deleted at AfD. Declining articles because not all content is referenced, for example, is I think pretty common (but I don't have a solid sample to say if this is a systemic problem, or I just stumbled upon some expections). Now, it's great to prod new editors and tell them to make sure everything is referenced - but if they don't do this, should their content be declined and even deleted, even through the same article, if published in the mainspace, would at best get some {{fact}}s? For example, recently Draft:Battle of Pinsk was declined due to no inline citations (it only had general links). The creator, fortunately, addressed this and now the article languishes in draft queue, even through it's obviously good enough for mainspace. But even without inline citations, it would've been fine as a stub/start-class; having inline citations is not necessary (not that I am not saying we should not push for their addition, I am just saying - the rules don't say lack of inline citations is sufficient reasons for not publishing content). Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nPS. Even AfC reviewing rules linked just above state that declining article due to lack of inline cites is an error: \"Avoid declining an article because it correctly uses general references to support some or all of the material. The content and sourcing policies require inline citations for only four specific types of material, most commonly direct quotations and contentious material about living persons.\" Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI have accepted this draft, though the lead section needs re-writing per WP:LEAD. Theroadislong (talk)\n\nThank you, @Theroadislong. I know some reviewers worry about what will happen if they accept WP:IMPERFECT articles. If the reviewer doesn't accept such an article, they break the nominal rules and often lose content (because the original editor will give up), but if they do, then someone who doesn't know the actual rules or who disagrees with them might come yell at them. If they do it more than rarely, the reviewer can end up at risk of a serious attack. One 'mistake' in 100 adds up to a lot of mistakes if you review thousands of articles, but nobody at ANI says \"1% possible error rate\"; they say \"Obvious WP:COMPETENCE problem; here are a dozen he screwed up on!\" WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nHere's what I think about the issue:\n\nAFC is essentially broken by design (See Wikipedia:Broken by design)\n\nIt takes an enormous amount of time\n\nReviewers do thankless work and don't want to exhaustively review a translation\n\nReviewers are technically speaking supposed to allow things that are notable & not promotive through regardless of translation qualify.\n\nThe articles are accurate & unbiased but badly translated\n\nLooked at a couple, consider Brazilian Romantic painting. The subject is notable and the article is probably going to be helpful to somebody, but the sentence \"This pictorial production was part of the local evolution of the Romantic movement\" seems typical. \"Pictorial\" is a word I assume is more common in portguese, but when used for no reason makes things jarring and hard to understand in English.\n\nThat one can probably be improved (though it would be a lot of work, given the length). But if you consider Draft:Renaissance in Ferrara, even the lead is genuinely difficult to understanding the meaning behind. Content can't be fixed if it can't be understood in the first place.\n\nNormal Wikipedia articles are also terrible\n\nThe current policy on badly translated articles is to leave them up, even if they're just -- in French.\n\nThere is Wikipedia:Pages_needing_translation_into_English\n\nSo, probably let them be created without AFC, but maybe the NGO should have someone who has native-level proficiency in English review them if they're not by professional translators? Because some of the text in Renaissance in Ferrara is bad, and Brazilian Romantic painting is obviously very oddly worded as of the first sentence. Maybe it's ok if some of the articles on Wikipedia are badly worded. Especially because AFC is not designed for this. Mrfoogles (talk)\n\nThe one thing that AFC *is* designed for is finding articles that duplicate material already present on Wikipedia, as in Draft:Wooden_house (see reviewer comment). That is important. Mrfoogles (talk)\n\nI don't see how this is a COI. The editors are writing on random topics they choose. Presumably they have no financial or other interest in the topics they are writing on. If individual editors have a COI, they should of course declare it and go through AfC. If an article is really terribly awful and not notable at all, it will be deleted, merged, BLARed, etc.; if an article is really terribly awful and of marginal notability, someone at NPP will probably draftify it. voorts (talk/contributions)\n\narbitrary break (translated for $$)\n\nThere have been a lot of assertions unsubstantiated opinions about the quality of OKA-generated content that range roughly from it sucks to very good, with little to back it up. As of yesterday, articles which have been assessed for quality and which carry the {{OKA}} template on the Talk page now appear in the standard, quality-assessment categories; the parent category is OKA articles by quality. (A flat, quality-agnostic view is available here.) I am not knowledgeable about how these ratings are assigned, but afaik it has something to do with the Afc process. It might be interesting to compare the quality distribution here with that of all translated articles. In any case, at least we have some data to look at, instead of just raw opinion. Mathglot (talk)\n\nAnything B and below is pretty much meaningless in terms of measuring quality as anyone can assign these ratings and they are not given much oversight/critical evaluation. I don't doubt some quality translated articles can exist but offering money for a task that can be very easily automated is a terrible idea as proven by the multiple examples of terrible articles.\n\n@7804j I don't know how your payment model works but if you're paying per article that's a bad idea. Why not pay for good/featured articles instead? It would be much harder to game such a system and would result in better quality if editors were required to work on an article beyond creation. Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nWe're not paying per quantity, but per hour of work and instructing that people should focus on quality. Our translators are also paid when they work on improvements of existing articles. 7804j (talk)\n\nHow do you measure hours worked given people are working remotely, is it just a trust based model? I can still see someone abusing that through using a machine translation then claiming they did it manually to inflate hours worked. Time clock fraud. Also what put feline hyperthyroidism on the radar, if I may ask? Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nI would say that while hours worked could be an interesting question and relevant for OKA's bookkeeping and financial health, the question of whether OKA is being defrauded by its users is irrelevant as far as Wikipedia article quality is concerned, so can we drop this line of inquiry, or move it to the OKA external website, and stick to the question of how this relates to Wikipedia?\n\nAs far as feline hyperthyroidism, I don't understand what you are asking; afaict, to mention this article. If you meant, \"How did this topic get picked up by an OKA editor?\" then I would say that my understanding is that OKA editors get to work on any topic of their choice. Is that what you were asking? Mathglot (talk)\n\nThanks for starting the category Category:OKA articles by quality, Mathglot, as a useful list of OKA articles. Unfortunately our assessments are normally almost entirely based on length, regardless of quality - and many OKA articles are all too long. I see there are ZERO A/FA/FL/GA class articles, & the great majority are B or C. Taking Brazilian Abolitionist Confederation, a 37 kbyte B-class slab from the dreaded User:Racnela21, this is in principle the kind of article I'd support, as being something we are unlikely to cover otherwise, even if it has only had about 40 views a month, a quick skim finds \"The document also reports on other aspects of the history of the advances and setbacks made in the Empire's path towards abolition, which is described as a fatality that \"caused slavery to become a fact and, what is more, to obtain universal tolerance\". Huh? Johnbod (talk)\n\nZero sounds like the right number. The total number of A/FA/FL/GA class articles in the encyclopedia is 59,491[source] and I would expect a sample of 60,000 articles drawn randomly from 8M articles in Wikipedia to have about 0.007 articles rated A/FA/FL/GA class. By that reckoning, we should see the first high quality OKA articles appear when the total number of OKA translations reaches somewhere between 200 and 1,000 times the current number. Mathglot (talk)\n\nYou're putting this paid editing on par with mass stub creation by now-banned users and all the terrible articles that wouldn't (or shouldn't) survive AfD. A lot of these articles are machine translated without any work in fixing them put into them by the 'creator'. Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nMy calculation is bonkers and I was going to redo it, but frankly trying to play a numbers game and somehow measure that against an unknown number of articles that shouldn't survive Afd is a distraction. In any case this is only a sliver of a much bigger issue, already being discussed in other forums, namely that of machine translation and AI output being added to the encyclopedia. This sliver is getting more attention because of the paid aspect, but it goes far beyond that. How are we to deal with that? Somebody said, \"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it,\" and quality ratings seem like the first step. If they are strictly connected with length, do they have any value at all then? Mathglot (talk)\n\nLet's be clear to those looking on; the calculation is not just wrong, it's wrong by many orders of magnitude and should be ignored. if about 60,000 out of 8M articles are A/FA/FL/GA, then that is a rate of 0.007 per article. If you then sample 60,000 articles, you would expect (60,000*.007) articles to me that class... not zero, but 420. If the OKA articles were as good as typical for reaching those classifications, we would expect to see them. (A reference above suggests there are 7000-and-some Oka articles, so we'd expect around 50 meeting that class.) This is not to say that there aren't other considerations, such as the age of the article; how many articles as new to engWiki as the Oka ones are of that class? -- Nat Gertler (talk)\n\nIt also takes time and motivation to achieve GA or FA. So don't expect new articles to easily reach that standard. For B class someone should have checked that it was well written. So hopefully B class OKA assessment is not just based on size and pictures. Graeme Bartlett (talk)\n\nWell, all too clearly they haven't - see various complaints above and elsewhere. Many of these are translations of FA/GA articles on other wikis. Even allowing for different standards, if they were in comprehensible English, many ought to at least pass GA. But neither OKA or anyone else is interested in nominating them, if only because they would often need a total rewrite. Johnbod (talk)\n\nThe featured article on de.wiki I saw translated by OKA had multiple prose lines that were unreferenced. Whether that is due to article deterioration or if it passed like that I am unsure of. But machine translation introduces many issues that would result in an article failing GA class. Traumnovelle (talk)\n\nNo, that's just how dewiki does things. They use very few inline citations, even in Featured Articles. Today's Featured Article there is w:de:Paul Maas (Altphilologe), which has ~1,300 words and 10 refs. About half the paragraphs have no citations at all. Their wiki, their rules. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nSince this is still running, people might like to comment at Talk:Spanish Decadence. Johnbod (talk)\n\nNotes (translated for $$)\n\nThe above collapsed discussion does raise a point that sometimes troubles me. Category links don't have footnotes. In theory they're supposed to be justified by sourced material in the article, but you can't necessarily tell which cite justifies the category.\n\nOf course in most cases this is not that much of a problem, but it can become one when someone adds a category that makes a potentially contentious claim. I remember this specifically over someone wanting to add category:Whitewashing in film to The Last Temptation of Christ (film), which struck me as an uncited criticism of the casting. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nPerhaps one way to resolve this for categories without an clear justification in the prose (or which might do if prose is removed from the article for any reason or perhaps even just reworded) would be to put a hidden comment next to the category link with a source or explicit link to the relevant section of the article (e.g. \"see criticism from XYZ Group\", \"source: P.D. Michaels, 2024\", \"Ref name=BBCNewsApril29\"). Thryduulf (talk)\n\nHmm, it's better than nothing, but it seems more aimed at editors than at readers. --Trovatore (talk)\n\n(A distinct but related concern is that categories can appear to make assertions in Wikivoice, which we have to be careful about.) --Trovatore (talk)\n\nCategories are supposed to be for defining characteristics. If it's a defining characteristic, it really should be in the prose (although with the way we create categories like \"Left-handed Inuit arcwelders from Texas\", it may be a combination of different sections of prose.) Per WP:CATV, \"It should be clear from verifiable information in the article why it was placed in each of its categories.\"-- Nat Gertler (talk)\n\nSomething else related to the collapsed part of this discussion, but not mentioned there, is that sometimes justification for a category can be implicit. For example if a person is verifiably Swedish and verifiably a member of an organisation that requires members to be Buddhists, you don't need an explicit citation to add Category:Swedish Buddhists to the article unless there is evidence they are/were not Buddhist (perhaps they renounced that religion later in life). Thryduulf (talk)\n\nI think someone adding a category which casts the subject in a negative light, most especially if a BLP, ought to be prepared to defend the addition if challenged. Wehwalt (talk)\n\nEverybody who adds anything needs to be prepared to defend it if challenged. In the example above the defence would be exactly as I've laid out - they are/were Swedish, are/were a member of an organisation that requires members to be Buddhists and there is no evidence the person adding it has seen to the contrary. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nHmm, so out of curiosity I took a look at that category, which has only two individual bios at the top level, one of which is Malin Ackerman. Ackerman's bio categorizes her as both a \"Swedish Buddhist\" as an \"American Buddhist\". However, the body asserts that she was raised Buddhist, and mentions her \"Buddhist upbringing\", but does not assert that she is currently Buddhist.\n\nNot sure there's a broad policy conclusion here, but I think it's worth noticing that articles are not always entirely careful about these things. Thryduulf, this is arguably similar to the case you mention. She was raised Buddhist, with sources (I haven't checked them, but that seems not on-point in this discussion), and we have no active assertion that she decided she wasn't a Buddhist anymore. Is that enough to put her in the cats? My intuition is no, not when the article uses language that seems noncommittal on her current status. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nI had a similar issue with people adding categories like Jewish Conservatives to Benjamin Disraeli, who was certainly not both Jewish and Conservative at the same time ... Wehwalt (talk)\n\nDisraeli is not even an edgecase - the lead of the article makes it very clear that that category is incorrect and so should not be on the article. Thryduulf (talk)\n\n@Trovatore: I picked the category out of thin air, so it's interesting you found an edgecase! Reading Ackerman's bio (but not the sources), I'd say that if the standard is \"on the balance of probabilities\" then the category is correct but if the standard is \"beyond reasonable doubt\" then it isn't (not because it's necessarily incorrect, but because there is reasonable doubt).\n\nWhen it comes to BLP anything contentious or potentially defamatory absolutely needs to have the higher standard of proof, something innocuous is usually fine at the lesser standard (although obviously better is always preferred if possible). A person's religious beliefs are something that can be contentious and some people would regard some mischaracterisations as defamatory, but not everybody and not always. Given the content in the article I am completely confident that describing Ackerman as Buddhist would not be defamatory even if correct, and I'm not seeing anything to suggest it is contentious. My gut feeling is that they are probably nominally or casually Buddhist - someone who doesn't actively practice the faith but would tick that box on a form. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nSo the analogy with legal burdens of proof could get a bit strained, but I'd kind of suggest that the (underused) clear and convincing evidence might be a better way of thinking of it. \"Eh, it's probably true\" doesn't strike me as good enough to add a cat, particularly to a BLP, even if we think the subject probably doesn't mind being called a Buddhist. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nI don't think categories are (or should be) limited to current status. Babe Ruth is not currently a baseball player, but he's probably properly in those categories. -- Nat Gertler (talk)\n\nWow, new one on me. I did not know that Babe Ruth was a Swedish Buddhist.\n\nAnyway I think that's a bit of a different issue. Ruth's profession was ballplayer, until he retired. That's what he was known for. Ackerman is not particularly known for being a Buddhist, as far as I'm aware.\n\nIt does raise some interesting questions. Eldridge Cleaver became a conservative Republican, but is most known for what you could call \"far left\" activism, to the limited IMHO extent that that terminology makes sense. Does he belong in e.g. \"socialist\" categories? I really don't know. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nMaybe we need \"Lapsed ...\" categories. Donald Albury\n\nI think the idea that categories should be a single-moment snapshot rather than reflecting the wide range that has been noted is wrong. We have a list of American politicians who switched parties in office -- which party's categories should they be under? Both! There may be some categorization that only applies to non-notable periods of their life -- Jane was baptized but declared herself an atheist when she was 12, long before she became a professional cat juggler, so she certainly doesn't belong in Christian cat jugglers and perhaps not even in Christians at all, but if she switched from atheism to agnosticism mid-career, then she does belong in both atheist cat jugglers and agnostic cat jugglers. -- Nat Gertler (talk)\n\nCategories are fundamentally for navigational purposes. If someone is looking for articles about ____, then they should find the articles related to _____, even if occasionally that article says \"Well, you might have thought he was a ____, but the truth is rather more complex and interesting than that\". WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI'm aware of that viewpoint but I don't really agree. The problem is that an article's presence in a category often appears to be an assertion (in Wikivoice no less) that the subject of the article satisfies the category's defining criterion. If there were a way to make it clear to readers, including casual ones, that that is not the case ... but there isn't. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nThat's the biggest problem imo, with cats. I stopped paying attention to them for that reason, as long as people are not using cats to enforce or contradict content in actual articles, fine with me. Selfstudier (talk)\n\nIn some cases it can be mitigated by renaming the cat to make the criterion more objective. For example I happened to see that the category I called out, category:Whitewashing in film, is actually at CfD. I think a lot of the problem would go away if we renamed it to something along the lines of category:Controversies over whitewashing in film. It's reasonably objective whether there was a controversy; you can support that with one reliable cite. Whether the film is actually an example of whitewashing is much more fraught. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nTrovatore, the second sentence of the Wikipedia:Categorization guideline literally says \"The central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to pages in Wikipedia within a hierarchy of categories\".\n\nI conclude from this that categories are therefore fundamentally for navigational purposes, equivalent to something in a navbox. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThat might be the goal, but it doesn't trump V or NPOV. I sharply disagree with the idea of providing categories that might appear to make contentious claims just because they might help someone find something. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWe follow the same basic rules for all forms of navigational content. That means that if it doesn't have to be cited in a navbox, it doesn't have to be cited in a category, or a ==See also== list, or a disambiguation page. None of them should be unfair (\"non-neutral\"), but the primary point of all navigation is to help people find things, not to hide appropriate content away because someone might jump to conclusions. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nPutting an article in category:Foos, on its face, makes the claim that the subject of the article is a foo. That ineluctably implicates V, and the claim that it is a foo must be cited (if contentious). --Trovatore (talk)\n\nSee also why {{unreferenced category}} exists.\n\nBut I wonder whether we have the same idea about what's being \"contended\" in that small minority of cats that are actually contentious. I think that what matters is whether the article would be of interest to someone looking for articles about _____. This would include articles that are not, sensu strictu, actually about _____. For example, if you look in Category:Planets, you will find 13 pages and one redirect that are not planets. If you take the POV that putting an article in Category:Planets means you are defining that article's subject as \"being a planet\", then you will be unhappy to discover pages like Definition of planet and Equatorial bulge in that cat, because those subjects are related to planets but not actually planets themselves. OTOH if you take my POV, which is that putting an article in that cat means that someone looking to learn more about planets might be interested in those articles, then you won't have any concerns about the contents of that cat at all. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nAs I said, if we could make your POV clear to all readers, including casual ones ... but we can't. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWe could. If we wanted to, every content cat page could have an explanation at the top that explains what a category is, what it means for a page to be listed there, and how to use the page. We haven't chosen to do this yet, but there's nothing stopping us from doing so, if we thought it was really important to explain to readers why Category:Planets does not exclusively contain articles about planets.\n\nActually, we already do, to a very limited extent; it looks like there's a link to Help:Category at the top of every cat page. That's more of a how-to/editor-help page, but we could change that to a reader-help page, if we wanted to. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nWhatamIdoing: No. We can't. I mean, sure, we can, but people won't see it.\n\nAnd that's COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I think it's utterly inconsistent with NPOV to apply categories that are going to look like assertions in Wikivoice and that are not supported by a consensus of sources. The navigational value is insignificant next to that. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nBut that's only if they go to the category page. The casual reader is only seeing the bottom of the page where it lists that this person is in Category:deadbeat dads and Category:pervs and skeezes with nothing covering the fact that he's in those categories as a critic of those people. (Obviously, I'm feeling far too lazy to look up a real example this morning.) -- Nat Gertler (talk)\n\nIf you're in the article, and it's important enough for the person to be in the cat, then there should normally be some content in the article itself that makes the relevance reasonably clear. That doesn't require the article to say \"Ro Righteous is a deadbeat dad \", but it should say something related to the subject (perhaps \"Ro Righteous has repeatedly introduced legislation about child support payments \"). WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nBecause if there isn't any relevant content in the article, then there's no navigational point in putting the article in [Cat:Deadbeat dads]. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nCategories are definitely a navigational tool...... when Wikipedia began we thought it'd be a good way of collecting data and analyzing relationships between articles. However categories are so unstable that data can never be reproduced for any real academic analysis. This is also a problem with our vital articles Moxy🍁\n\nI think they're still a pretty good way of collecting data and analyzing relationships/various other things. They're certainly useful for building graphs and graphs can be very useful. There can be a lot of instability and confusing weirdness, but for the one fairly large topic area I've looked at, there are plenty of relatively stable structures in the networks too (that can be easier to see when edges are bundled e.g. here). Sean.hoyland (talk)\n\nIdea is cat= List= navbox sort of thing, I get that but they are susceptible to manipulation and lots of editors can't be bothered to check, including me, although I used to. I might correct if I happen to notice something weird or outlandish, but all this diffuse, parent/child blah, nah. Selfstudier (talk)\n\n@Trovatore, your comment that people won't see it has made me wonder if you and I are talking about completely different things. So I'm talking about something that looks like this:\n\nand I think you're talking about something that looks like this:\n\nAre you only talking about the list at the bottom of the article? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThe categories as shown at the bottom of the article are my main concern, yes. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nAs a general rule, if the cat is at the bottom of the page, there should be something on the page above that explains why the cat is there. That might not be \"He's definitely a <cat name> himself\", but it should explain why this biography is related to that cat's subject. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nIn my view that's not good enough. I don't think there's any way to avoid giving the impression that the category at the bottom of the page is an assertion in Wikivoice, which means it needs the support of a consensus of sources. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nTotally agree. If you RFC'd this, I'd support. And start sourcing See Also sections while we're at it. Primergrey (talk)\n\nThat's what the articles are for. Just repeating the sources used in category pages that the article already has would just make category pages really cluttered. Also, and this is just me, but you are insulting the intelligence of our readers if you think that they can't come to the conclusion that the categories in the article are representative of the sources used in said article. ♠JCW555 (talk)♠\n\nHuh? I didn't say anything about category pages. As I said, my main concern is that the categories as they display in the article may appear to be assertions in Wikivoice. Therefore articles should not be added to those categories unless the implied assertion would be the view of the consensus of the sources, not just a single source.\n\nI don't think there's any available reform of the category system that addresses this concern. It could be I just haven't thought of it, in which case please do elaborate.\n\nI think the only solution consistent with V and NPOV is to categorize less, specifically not to apply categories that would appear to be assertions and that are not supported by a consensus of sources. I think this concern is massively more important than ease of navigation. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nCan you give me a couple of examples of BLPs in which a given cat is included, but the consensus of the sources is that the cat is irrelevant or wrong? I'm not looking for something like \"This scholar is the foremost authority on deadbeat dads, so if you want to know about deadbeat dads, you need to read his work\" or \"This person is primarily notable because of a landmark court case about deadbeat dads\", but \"His ex once called him a deadbeat dad, and the consensus of sources is that she's wrong, but I put him in the cat anyway\". WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nWay up higher in this same discussion there's the case of Malin Ackerman, who is categorized as a \"Swedish Buddhist\", an \"American Buddhist\", and some others. However the article does not say she is a Buddhist at all; it says she was raised Buddhist.\n\nIn the discussion it was speculated that she might be a casual or nominal Buddhist, or anyway someone who doesn't mind being called Buddhist, and that may well be true.\n\nMy view is that's not good enough. If we are going to put her in those cats, then the article should be able to say in Wikivoice \"Malin Ackerman is a Buddhist\", with all the sourcing requirements that entails. I don't mean that the article necessarily has to say that, but it has to be able to say it. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nAre people raised in a religion not appropriately described as being related to that religion? I think you are interpreting this as \"If it says Category:Buddhist, then the person must be actively Buddhist right now\". I interpret it as indicating that the person is or was Buddhist. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nOf course, if we had sources saying that she was definitely no longer Buddhist, then we'd use Category:Former Buddhists instead. But since we know that she definitely was in the past, and we don't have any concrete reason to believe that has changed, then I think the category is fine. We don't have a category. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nNo, I disagree. A living person in a \"Buddhist\" category should be verifiably a Buddhist right now. With strong enough sourcing to put that claim in Wikivoice. That's the natural inference a reader is going to make seeing the category at the bottom of the page. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nI don't think that someone who reads \"She was raised Buddhist\" will either be surprised to see Buddhism-related cats, or jump to conclusions beyond the statement that they just read. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nBut they may not have read that part of the article. It appears to be an assertion in Wikivoice that she is a Buddhist. It should require the same sourcing as an assertion in Wikivoice that she is a Buddhist. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nAnd by the way, that's not \"jumping to a conclusion\". That's what the plain language means on its face. You can't change that fact by putting assertions to the contrary on help pages. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nThe difference is that you (Trovatore) believe that presence in a category means the article subject is (subject of category) whereas WhatamIdoing is arguing that the presence in a category means the article subject is, was or is relevant to (subject of category). Based on how categories are used, the latter is correct. For example John Major is in all the following categories:\n\nCategory:British Secretaries of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs\n\nCategory:Chancellors of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom\n\nCategory:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\n\nCategory:Conservative Party prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n\nCategory:Councillors in the London Borough of Lambeth\n\nCategory:Leaders of the Conservative Party (UK)\n\nCategory:Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)\n\nAll of them are or were true at some point but are not now, yet nobody is being mislead. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nWell, I think those are a different case. Those are offices, and it's natural that they include anyone who has held the office. But note that it would be objectively incorrect to put someone in one of those categories who had not held the office, even if they were \"relevant to\" the office. So no, \"the latter\" is not correct. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWhat makes an office different to non-offices?\n\nWhy is it \"natural\" to include former office-holders in an office-holder category and completely inappropriate to put someone who was a Buddhist but who might or might not currently be in a category for Buddhists?\n\nWhich type are categories for place of origin? people associated with a place? occupational categories (e.g. John Major is in Category:English bankers)?\n\nIs it appropriate for Boris Johnson to be in both Category:Politicians from Manhattan and Category:People who renounced United States citizenship? What about both Category:Writers from the London Borough of Southwark and Category:Writers from Manhattan? Does his presence in Category:Partygate scandal imply that he is a scandal? If not, why is that different to him being in Category:British Anglicans? Thryduulf (talk)\n\nI'd use a \"reasonable person\" test here.\n\nWould a reasonable person, without inside knowledge of Wikipedia, take the category \"Swedish Buddhists\", appearing at the bottom of an article on a living person, as implying that the person is currently a Swedish Buddhist? Yes, I think they would.\n\nWould such a person take the category \"Presidents of the United States\" as implying that the subject is currently the President of the United States? No.\n\nWould such a person take that category as implying strictly that the subject is or has been the President of the United States, and that no other sort of \"relevance\" counts at all? Yes, clearly. Putting someone in that category who was even extraordinarily relevant to the US presidency, but had never been the US President, would be an unambiguous error.\n\nHope that clarifies. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nIt seems the reasonable people you're replying to disagree. Anomie⚔\n\nYou think the examples here aren't what a reasonable person would expect from categories? JoelleJay (talk)\n\nI think that reasonable people might have different ideas. For example, some (I think) reasonable people in this discussion believe that only people who definitely and currently profess a given religion should be listed in the cat for that religion. Some other (I think) reasonable people in this discussion believe that the cat should include people who did profess that religion, and for whom we have no reason (i.e., reliable source saying) to believe that their religious affiliation has changed.\n\nI wonder what the first group would make of Category:Wikipedia people. Do they believe that there is only a single reasonable answer to whether only current editors should be considered \"Wikipedia people\", or do they think that reasonable editors might sometimes disagree about whether an important but inactive editor should be included in that cat? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nIf we have no info confirming whether someone currently practices a religion, or that that religion verifiably played a significant part in their life at some point, how can we possibly consider it a \"defining characteristic\"? What would anyone who wants to learn more specifically about Swedish Buddhists gain from a page about someone whose status as a Swedish Buddhist is so ambiguous and brief that it barely warrants a mention? I also think it's frankly hypocritical that we'd only seem to make these assumptions/assertions of religious observation based on such weak textual support for intersections that are \"unusual\"; most people in the US grow up belonging to some strain of Christianity, and this can probably be verified for many of those who are notable, yet we don't go around categorizing them as \"American Christian actors\" etc. unless they've explicitly identified as such. JoelleJay (talk)\n\n> how can we possibly consider it a \"defining characteristic\"\n\nDid you know that cats don't actually have to be defining characteristics? I can't remember whether we've talked about this before, but the guideline gives Caravaggio as an example, and lists the two defining characteristics. Yet, if you go look at the article, you'll find a lot more than two cats, and several of them, including Category:Knights of Malta, Category:Italian duellists, and Category:Deaths from sepsis, aren't defining cats. You're required to include the defining cats, but it's also okay for editors to use their judgment to add a reasonable number of non-defining cats, too. Over at Donald Trump, they appear to have decided that it's reasonable to include 62 cats in that BLP. I'd guess that around 10% of them are defining (maybe less, if you prefer a strict definition). WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI agree with this, and on a side note as someone who does go to category pages to find new topics it is not at all helpful for them to be cluttered with entries that are only tenuously related. If I'm browsing contemporary Algerian authors it's because I want to learn about authors for whom \"being Algerian\" is a defining characteristic, not, e.g., French people who wrote about spending a few summers in Algeria. I also wish Wikipedia categories would distinguish between cats that are actually defining features of a topic, cats to which a topic belongs but that it's not \"known for\", and cats \"associated with\" a topic. I use color-coding when categorizing some of my own spreadsheets, so I can picture a system where on the topic's page cats of the first type are highlighted in cyan, cats of the second in yellow, and cats of the third in grey, and the topic is highlighted with its corresponding color on the category page. JoelleJay (talk)\n\nThis prioritization idea appeals to me, because sometimes you want to be able to find the famous cancer survivor who happens to be an athlete, vs the famous athlete who happens to be a cancer survivor.\n\nBut I also think it would lead to POV disputes, as people will inevitably, on some articles, have different ideas about what's most important. Lou Gherig probably thought that being a baseball player was more important than developing a neurological problem, but folks who are currently living with Lou Gherig's disease might think it was the other way around. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nLou Gehrig would certainly have \"baseball player\" and \"people with ALS\" as primary categories in my system. JoelleJay (talk)\n\nWhile Categorizations are navigational in purpose… that navigation is based on defining characteristics.\n\nFor a characteristic to be considered defining for a specific subject/topic, I would expect the article text would discuss that characteristic and explain why it is defining to the subject/topic. Furthermore, I would expect a defining characteristic to have more than just a passing mention in the article. Blueboar (talk)\n\nI mostly agree with Blueboar, though sometimes a passing mention is enough. A birth date in 1956 should be enough to be in the cat \"people born in 1956\". But cats like that are more noise than useful. The cat \"criminals\" must have in the article a reliable source for a criminal conviction, etc. The practice that annoys me the most is the use of cats as an alternative for \"see also\" when the characteristic doesn't literally apply to the article subject. Zerotalk\n\nHow to photographs align with WP:V? Consider an example \"Jane Jones drove to work in a blue Chevrolet\" where sources describe Jane Jones driving to work, have a picture of her blue Chevrolet, but do not explicitly describe the vehicle as blue. Would we be able to describe the vehicle in our articles based on the photograph publish in a WP:RS or only based on prose descriptions published in WP:RS? I took a glance at WP:V and couldn't find anything. --24.125.98.89 (talk)\n\nIf a photograph is published in a RS, we generally trust that the photograph is what the RS says it is. Synthesis can still creep in though. In your example, if the RS just says “this is a picture of Jane Jones’s car”, then it’s possible that she drove to work in a different car which might not have been blue. If the RS says clearly “this is the car in which Jane Jones drove to work”, then I think it would be verifiable to say she drove to work in a blue car. If this turns out to be an important or controversial fact (e.g. for Blue–green distinction in language reasons), we might want to ask for the assessment of “blue” to be made by the RS rather than by the editor.\n\nIf the source isn’t explicit in text, then it may also be a question of whether that information is due. Barnards.tar.gz (talk)\n\n24.125, is this related to the tag you added to List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States, July 2024 about whether the would-be assassin was actually a white person? I don't think anyone has any genuine doubts about that, and a couple of minutes turned up sources like these:\n\n\"a tall, slender, white man who wore glasses and had long sandy-brown hair\" [1]\n\n\"According to the FBI, the shooter was identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a white male\" [2]\n\nI don't think you should assume that the information was added on the basis of a photo. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThat series of lists does seem to have both V and DUE issues in the race column. I spot checked a few. There are cases where the person’s race is not mentioned and there is no photo, making it look like race has been inferred from name by the editor. There are cases where the person’s race is not mentioned and an image is given, and the editor may have made their own judgement about what their race looked like. Barnards.tar.gz (talk)\n\n@Barnards.tar.gz, were you looking at only the cited sources? Do you have any reason to believe that any of these are actually wrong?\n\nIn terms of Gun v"
