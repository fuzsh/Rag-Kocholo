That was easy.\" From the friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nfixed. -- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nI've been running these two bots for a while. Both still run on old pywikibot compat code that will break soon. I could invest time in updating these bots and I have been considering doing that for quite some time, but I realized I just don't have the motivation for it. Commons has become a toxic place dominated by a small group of very vocal users. These users don't seem to accept that Russavia is banned and to try to turn everything into \"Commons community\" vs \"WMF\" battle. I don't identify with that and I don't feel like investing time in a project where this behavior is acceptable. Multichill (talk)\n\n@Multichill: I don't think that commons is a toxic place, there are a lot of volunteers doing very hard work (which never participating in AN discussion). I also fail to see a \"Commons community\" vs \"WMF\" battle. I am highly disappointed by your statement here and i think under this circumstances you should also step back your sysop bit. Best --Steinsplitter (talk)\n\nI am rather surprised that someone feels Commons is a toxic environment but I can empathize because I feel the exact same way about the English Wikipedia. I understand not wanting to make the investment of time to recode the bots but I thank you for the effort you went through to do it this long. I have found in the past that taking a break often helps me feel differently about things and have found in the past that when I stopped doing something or \"retired\" I missed working on the project and came back. I also don't really see the \"Commons community\" vs \"WMF\" battle but I do see that the WMF periodically oversteps their authority and does things counter to what the community wants simply because they can and because its more convenient for them. Some members of both communities feel like they don't need the other when these projects cannot succeed without mutual cooperation between the communities and the WMF. IMO the Russavia case illustrates that disassociation. Most of the time the WMF won't help the projects when asked to do so but then when it wants to do something it does it, violating any previous statements it made to the contrary. Reguyla (talk)\n\nSorry to read this, Multichill; I was brought to this link by your post on the mailing list. What a shame that others had to make comments that entirely prove you right. Risker (talk)\n\nRisker, you have contributed to Commons on 4 occasions this year, and uploaded a total of 4 images in the 8 years of your account history. A part of having open discussion on Commons is that we regularly see people parachute in who seem to enjoy stirring up drama, are highly vocal off-wiki or off-project (as I know you to be), and dictate to long term contributors that we are terrible people for devoting our unpaid volunteer time here for the benefit of open knowledge. Many of us hide out on IRC and discuss issues on closed channels rather than risking becoming target of these sorts of unpleasant types of griefing. If you want to do something positive for Commons, take part in one of our projects for a while, and use that experience to form a solid evidence-based opinion on how our community works and how it can improve. --Fæ (talk)\n\nYes, I know, Fae. I do not normally participate here because of my earliest interactions in which I was treated rudely and (in at least one early case) in a manner worse than I've ever been treated on English Wikipedia, which ironically I consider to be a pretty unpleasant place for a lot of users - it's the one thing Reguyla and I will agree about. I'm not a photographer, and I'm not looking elsewhere on the internet for images or other media; this wouldn't ever be my home. I do, however, care a lot about developers, oddly enough. I do care when people who have built useful tools that help the entire Wikimedia community feel that they're no longer valued. I'm shocked that the first reaction to his post was \"please hand in your sysop bit\". I'd hope you be shocked too. Risker (talk)\n\n@Risker: I am disappointed by your comment :-(. Why you put oil in the fire? There might be some toxic users here, but there are also toxic users on enwp, dewp and other wikis. Calling a project \"toxic\" (putting all users under the same umbrella) is very immature. It is hurting to see Multichil, a commons admin, talking so bad about commons. I applicate his botwork and it is sad to see that he does not port his bots to core. If he really thinks that commons is so bad, he should probably step back his sysop bit or doing something to make commons better. But such \"commons is toxic\" posts are imho not helpful at all. It is not fair to call commons toxic. Commons is a wonderful place with a lot of hardworking users, and it is always a pleasure to work together with other users here on commons. --Steinsplitter (talk)\n\nThanks for your work Multichill. @Risker: shame yourself for your attempt to start a flame war. --Denniss (talk)\n\nSorry about that; it was not my intention to start a flame war, which frankly I think started with the first post. I am actually quite shocked that the first two comments are defending the atmosphere that Multichill finds distressing instead of \"sorry to see you're not happy here, would you be willing to share your code with another developer can look at making the necessary changes?\" That's what I'd really hope to see. If the work these two bots have been doing is valued by the Commons community (and given they have made a combined 1.92 million edits, I suspect their work has been useful), I'd hope that the Commons community would focus (a) on trying to find a way to continue the work of the bots, for its sake and (b) simply express sorrow that a longstanding member of the community has chosen to leave, instead of asking for them to completely disassociate with the project. (Seriously, asking for his sysop bit?) Risker (talk)\n\nEmotionally colouring/escalating this thread by introducing words like \"distress\" and \"shocked\" does not help show your intention is to avoid creating drama. Could you confirm which email discussion you referenced that directed you here? It does not appear to be one of the open lists I am subscribed to. --Fæ (talk)\n\nThe mailing list is wikitech-L, which is a public list. Thread is \"API BREAKING CHANGE: Default continuation mode for action=query will change at the end of this month\". Risker (talk)\n\nJust to clarify, my post was not intended to flame anything but to thank them for their participation, encourage them to take a break and continue and to empathize for their feelings because I know how it feels from my time on ENWP. I would like to see at least some of the work done by these bots done by someone if not Multichill but I hope they change their mind. I also find it somewhat ironic that they blame this community for not being nicer to the WMF and then mentions 2 issues with his bots that are the direct result of actions by the WMF (although I admit they are for the long term good of the projects). I am also glad that me and Risker have some common ground. Reguyla (talk)\n\nThanks, for the record I see the link in this post this morning. I keep an eye on Labs-l but the tech list (and the IRC channel) is a bit too busy with so many different things I rarely try to follow them. --Fæ (talk)\n\n@Multichill: thank you for your hard work. I completely agree with you and feeling much the same way, sadly it isn't a nice feeling to have when you've lost interest and motivation. Bidgee (talk)\n\nI know how you feel Maarten... It's really, really, demotivating. And yes, en.wp isn't too much better. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nDepending on who you ask, myself included, ENWP is far worse than Commons. I will say though that things are getting better now that some of the historically problematic admins are getting to the Judge, Jury and Executioner (AKA , the Arbcom). So things are looking up there. Reguyla (talk)\n\nThank God for this decision! Erfgoed bot will not be missed (by me, anyway).--Strainu (talk)\n\n@Multichill: Do you have a source code repo for your bot's code and what is the main entry point. Is /data/project/catbot/readme.txt still up-to-date? Also, could you share what was set in cron? Thanks in advance. If it is on Tool labs, which free license did you choose for the source code? -- Rillke(q?)\n\nThe cat script seems to be on labs and freely licensed (short test: seems broken). See grep -R \"Please add categories to this image\" /data/project/catbot/. On the other scripts i haven't seen a license :-(. --Steinsplitter (talk)\n\nThere is a general problem of bots and scripts which are widely used but not maintained properly (because the author is overstrained, tired, leaved the project or have some conflicts etc.). As regards ErfgoedBot, it is a very helpful tool but its development and maintenance appears to get freezed before years still. An example: ErfgoedBot updated daily a set of pages Commons:Monuments database/Unknown fields. However, its operator absolutely doesn't respond to reports about changes of field names in the affected templates. We cannot improve the templates nor correct their inaccuracies because WLM mill is not able to reflect the changes. I think, such important processes should be not so dependent on individuals and their fickleness. With all respect and gratitude for them. But I can't see inside where the problem springs from. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nIf someone writes a useful bot, and you find yourself running projects that rely on it, then you should feel free to ask the operator if they have shared the source code on github or similar. There have been several cases where we have tools and bots where this was never discussed and if a volunteer becomes seriously unwell, or is on a long wikibreak/seems retired for whatever reason, they are unlikely to find the time to cooperate. We should also encourage our most critical bots to have multiple operators and maintainers. This reduces the chance they will be unexpectedly lost and has the great benefit that the burden of maintenance is shared.\n\nLastly, as a fickle and tired bot operator I occasionally get thanked by users, but not very often. In fact far more often I get repeated complaints about things not working well, or chasing me about things that are out of my power to fix (like WMF server drop-outs!). If you use a bot, automated report or tool, and think to yourself how useful and neat it is, spend a few seconds by rewarding the operator with a barnstar to keep them sweet and engaged with the project. Bot operators are unpaid volunteers focused on the public good like everyone else. --Fæ (talk)\n\nYes - regrettably, the best and most important work is usually accepted as matter of course. We appreciate it just when we lose it, or when it get to be insufficient. Maybe, we should express thanks explicitly more often. However, when someone's work is widely used and have amounts of its fruit, that can be also a powerful source of satisfaction – that was also my way to express my gratitude for Multichill's (and other's) work on WLM. Maybe, improvement requests can be also perceived as expression of appreciation and thanks? I hope, some programmers will be capable to help Multichill with his work, or to take his relay, or to mediate related conflicts? It would be a pity to leave a monument database and lists to perish. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nAt Template talk:PD-NL-Gov/en is a 'kept' tag, while at Commons:Copyright_tags#Non-U.S._works under Netherlands it says it is depreciated. On Template:PD-NL-Gov/en it says: Images using the PD-NL-Gov tag need to be relicensed or deleted, as appropriate. To me it appears that if after a deletion request discussion it is decided it is 'kept', this would mean the template isn't depreciated. Do I understand this correctly ? Regards, --OSeveno (talk)\n\n@OSeveno: They are not the same.. a template can be 'deprecated' (meaning it's no longer intended to be used) but 'kept' (because it has an unwieldy number of existing uses that need to be fixed, and deletion of the template would remove the ability to track them). In the case of this particular template, it was actually deleted after the original discussion, but then recreated later that same day as a 'deprecated' template, presumably after it was pointed out that it was in use. The 'kept' is misleading. As it stands now, the template is not intended to be used (but is linked quite a few times from old discussion). No files use it, and none should. Revent (talk)\n\n(as a further note) The 'kept' on the talk page was added by a bot, when it noticed that the (recreated) page still existed after the discussion was closed. Revent (talk)\n\nThanks for clarifying that. Regards, --OSeveno (talk)\n\nHi there. I'm planning on tackling the batch upload request Commons:Batch uploading/Freshwater and Marine Image Bank.

I strongly advice nobody on Wikimedia give this report any oxygen. The authors build a case by assuming many things that are patently untrue or seriously unlikely. Given that the paper is about \"Public Domain\", it is startling that their definition of this is completely wrong. They include CC-licensed works, saying \"For the purposes of this paper, therefore, we include works which may be freely used under a Creative Commons license, even though in many cases the author technically retains title\". There's no \"technically\" or \"in many cases\" about who retains \"title\". Claiming that works with a \"free\" licence are public domain, and that credit of authorship is merely a technicality is stupendously ignorant and disrespectful. They make further assumptions about how much Google increases traffic flow if a web page contains in image and how much a Wikipedia page is worth in terms of advertising revenue (I kid you not). At one point, when discussing novels becoming public domain and therefore sold at a cheaper price, they completely confuse \"publisher\" with \"copyright owner\" (i.e., author). I can only assume that Harvard Journal of Law & Technology is where C-grade term papers go to be archived, and shouldn't be confused with a serious academic publication. Sigh. -- Colin (talk)\n\nColin The paper at least demonstrates public interest in the value of Wikimedia content. If it is wrong then it gives the next researcher something to challenge. Blue Rasberry (talk)\n\nWhen I read the list of assumptions in the paper half of them did not seem reasonable, so just like Colin I was taking the findings with a grain of salt; however I think it is a good start and the numbers are likely to be within of the right order of magnitude. Hopefully next iteration will get it closer. I always had a problem with estimations calculated by assuming dozen numbers with some huge or unknowable error bars and then multiplying them together to get your estimate. I am mostly interested in those error bars because that is what will tell me if the real value is likely to be off by 1%, 100% or 1000%. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nJarekt, I don't believe the figures are anywhere near the right order of magnitude because they ask us to imagine a world without PD and a world where Wikipedia is not a free content project that attracts freely licensed images and a world where Wikipedia's budget could pay for $250 million of photos per year (which is about five times WMF's entire annual budget). Their $250 million is naively worked out by taking the 2 million pages with free photos and multiplying that with the cost that Getty/Corbis charge to licence a single photo on a website for a year ($105-$117). Now I don't know where they get that licence figure from -- it often varies by the size of image you are licensing and quite possibly also by other factors like age or quality. The thing is that nobody who needs to licence 2 million images would pay the same unit cost as someone who licenses one. The incompetence of this economic mistake is staggering. (Getty own 80 million still images and annual revenue is $869 million -- there's no way 2 million thumbnail images licensed to a non-profit would bring in $250 million) And many images are sold for a great deal more than that for higher value purposes such as advertising. A world without public domain images or freely licensed images would much more heavily use photo agencies, so market forces means the price per image would also be less. And a Wikipedia that had to pay for images would undoubtedly licence 240px thumbnails rather than the multi-megapixel images that Commons actually hosts. Given the big stock photo corporations recent behaviour, I can well imagine them coming to a deal with Wikipedia that lets them use the small thumbnails for free, in return for a link on the file-description page that allowed viewers to see the high-resolution photo for a fee or to license it themselves. So in this world, without Commons, the cost of the images that Wikipedia uses is zero. $0. No error bars or orders of magnitude. Wikipedia pays nothing for the images. But there is no Commons for anyone else to use high resolution images. And you have to pay to look at any image in detail. How does someone put a price on how shit that world would be? -- Colin (talk)\n\nIf Commons didn't exist, most people would probably put their free images on some other site. There are already quite a lot on Flickr. --ghouston (talk)\n\nAlthough some images from people who just want to put an image on a Wikipedia page, without caring much about license, probably wouldn't be CC licensed otherwise. --ghouston (talk)\n\n--ghouston, they are imagining a world without free image content at all. So not just \"no Commons\" but \"no CC anywhere\". They aren't particularly interested in Wikipedia/Commons but in trying to put a value on the \"public domain\" (even though they completely misdefine it). They are only using Wikipedia as it is a publicly available source of information to mine. The two most disappointing things about this are that it is yet another study of Wikipedia / Free Content Project where the authors don't really understand the domain and that such a dire C-grade effort is being published at all. Have they never heard of Getty Embed -- 50 million images freely usable. What is most sad really, is the ideology that one needs to (or it even makes sense to) put a monetary value on things that are in the community (public domain images) or that are donated to the community (freely licensed images). -- Colin (talk)\n\nPersonally I think that study is overrated. We can see how much this site would be worth by looking at how much Wikia makes. Sure we get a bit more traffic, so add about 10 or 15% but its no where near the hundreds of millions they say in the study and we would lose a lot as well. If this site were for profit then that means the donations would stop and it would be taxed on what it makes. I heard that the WMF gets a little bit of a discount on IT services from the data warehouse they are using due to its ta free status so that would be lost too. A lot of the volunteers would leave and would need to be replaced by paid folks. So to me the whole study makes assumptions of things being equal when they would be far from equal in reality. Reguyla (talk)\n\nWay back in the day there were several Spanish-speaking Wikipedians who forked and created en:Enciclopedia Libre to protest a proposal to make Wikipedia into a for-profit venture. We don't want that repeated. We can't do what the study proposes. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nI was working on some images today and noticed that the source information on File:Don_J._Jenkins.jpg is incorrect. We have the description that this person is Bryan Battaglia, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff but its actually Don Jenkins the medal of Honor recipient. I noticed this because I know what they both look like in person and I knew this was not a picture of Bryan Battaglia. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have caught this. When I looked at the source for the photo it is also incorrect. My question here is, what are our procedures for correcting something like this? I can contact the DoD source and get that fixed, but I'm not sure how we would change it here to reflect the correct information. Reguyla (talk)\n\nWe'd change it by editing, just like anything else that gets corrected. I'm not sure what you think is difficult, so I can't give you anything more specific. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nSorry for the misunderstanding, it wasn't a matter of not knowing how, I just wanted to make sure that it was appropriate since any change would not match the supporting source link. Reguyla (talk)\n\nPresumably you will have some source for your change. Cite it. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nNot for this one I don't other than anyone can look at the corresponding articles on ENWP and see that the image is not of Battaglia but of Jenkins. The group of images on Flickr all seem to refer to Battaglia even in the ones he isn't in and several have the exact same description, so I wanted to ask what should be done about that. Should we leave the incorrect description that was pulled in from the source, should we change it to reflect something more accurate or should we just leave it and maybe put a history statement or note saying that its wrong, but the description is actually X. Reguyla (talk)\n\nI'd just replace the original description with a correct one. It will be easily verified as correct if there are other photos in Commons of the same person, or he's easily identified in a web image search. --ghouston (talk)\n\nI think the photo shows Gary L. Littrell. Mrwojo (talk)\n\nI'd include \"probably\" or \"possibly\" in the description if there was any room for doubt. You could also put \"possibly Don J. Jenkins or Gary L. Littrell\". Other sources may list who was at the event. --ghouston (talk)\n\nI would like to use this image on the English Wikipedia for the page however since the file is hosted on the Hungarian Wikipedia (and I don't speak Hungarian) would it be possible for this to be transferred to the Commons? The C of E (talk)\n\nYes, you can load a copy of it here as public domain. The engraving was created/published in 1778 (based on an original in the UK National Portrait Gallery) and faithful reproductions of it are considered to have no additional copyright. It is possible to use bots to arrange transfer, but it's quicker for you to download and re-upload to Commons, just use the standard upload link and wizard. --Fæ (talk)\n\nSo I have been running User:GifTagger for some time until it was blocked due to \"Problem with the editing and the enforcement of an opinion without conversation with the relevant community\" in January. I had to clean up the code and was too busy with other things that time anyway. Though, now I feel like getting a discussion up on this topic. I had some users on my talk page asking if I could fire the bot up again but I'd rather have any sort of feedback before getting blocked out of the blue again. --McZusatz (talk)\n\nJust to start the discussion, I will present what I think are the advantages of using PNG over GIF:\n\nBetter thumbnails\n\nC.f. thumb on the right; GIF thumbnails are often pixelated due to transparency (Only a single transparency index is supported). Also PNG thumbnails support 24-bit RGB in contrast to a maximum of 256 colors in GIF (thumbnail) files.\n\nSmaller size\n\nGIF files tend to be larger than PNG\n\nEasier editing/\"Lossless\" editing\n\nSomeone may want to edit those files. Surely the editor prefers a 24-bit palette over the 8-bit GIF-palette without uploading a new PNG derivative file before or after his edit by fiddling with (partly) broken tools such as UpWiz or DerivativeFX. Also you can not apply most filters to indexed palettes which results in a lossy process: Palette -> 24 bit -> Apply filter -> another? Palette\n\nHowever, the conversion from GIF to PNG is lossless and also the transparency, if present, does not get lost. (PNG supports 8-bit transparency in contrast to GIF's 1-bit transparency.)\n\n--McZusatz (talk)\n\nMy opinion is to leave the GIFs as is and only update them on a needed basis. A large number of GIFs should be replaced by SVG (vector data) to begin with, so a extra PNG is unneeded in a large number of cases. Thumbnail point you made could be dealt with by generating PNG thumbnails with a anti-alias option instead of generating GIF thumbnails (i.e. similar to how we convert SVG to PNG for thumbnails/re-sizing). This is an issue that could be fixed through the wikimedia software end without having to re-upload a new version of every file. Offnfopt(talk)\n\n@McZusatz: One rationale I find hard to understand is (for example at File:Enrico cialdini.png): \"This GIF was problematic due to non-greyscale color table.\" Isn't it correct for a colour image to have a non-greyscale colour table⁇ I'm not sure which of your other rationales may also apply, but the filesize was bigger than that of File:Enrico cialdini.gif. I'm also a little concerned that (non-admins) lose the edit history of the deleted files, so it's harder to check the licensing etc. --99of9 (talk)\n\n99of9 After reading your comment, I went ahead and ran a small test case of some of the files in the contrib list for the bot. I don't have access to see the pages for the deleted files, so I converted the PNG files to GIFs using the exact same indexed palette found in the PNG, so there is no loss or change in the image from the conversion I did. The original GIF file sizes may be different from mine depending on what options they used to save the files, I didn't do any special optimizations or tweaks to the files. The below table is the results of this small test case. You can see from the table that the claim of PNG having a smaller file size did not hold up to this test case. Also as I stated before, the bulk of these images are better served being converted to vector graphics due to the nature the pictures. Offnfopt(talk)\n\nFile GIF size (in bytes) PNG size (in bytes) Smaller file size PNGopt File:Enis logo2.png 1,997 2,150 GIF File:Enlarged lateral ventricles in schizophrenia.png 45,747 58,353 GIF 39.227 File:Enlarged spleen.png 10,106 10,960 GIF File:Enlluita-logo.png 5,500 6,009 GIF File:Enmascaramiento temporal.png 4,032 5,391 GIF File:Enneagram - 2.png 30,934 31,843 GIF File:Ennea triangle.png 1,139 2,161 GIF File:Enrico cialdini.png 19,980 23,409 GIF 17.314 File:Enrin u0.png 13,577 20,241 GIF 11.227 File:Ensea-fonctions.png 7,854 7,815 PNG\n\nI can agree Offnfopt and 99of9. The file size is only one point, as I mentioned to McZusatz before, the bot need a simple PNG optimizing function (I used the very fast PNGGauntlet). So I only vote for the bot if he has such functionaltiy. ↔ User: Perhelion (Commons: = crap?)\n\nI replaced the poor PNG optimization with some better one in the meantime, so this should not be an issue any more. --McZusatz (talk)\n\n@99of9, Offnfopt: Your proposal to use PNG for thumbnails instead of GIF, indeed solves the issues that can be observed in GIF thubnails today. Nonetheless, I'd still prefer to have the source image in PNG as well to make it easier for users to upload an enhanced version without going through quantization of the color values. This quantization degrades an image slightly if the color values don't match the quantization levels. --McZusatz (talk)\n\nI want to add that I'm not against the bot per se, when I first posted I was in the mind set thinking the bot was going to leave the original GIF, so I was thinking it was going to cause a large number of duplicate files. But being that is not the case and letting the pros and cons rattle around in my head for a while, I'm warming up to the idea. Though I do worry about the bot encountering a file configuration it may not be able to handle and end up outputting a garbage PNG file and removing the original GIF. I wonder if the bot should generate a paged gallery log of files converted so others could keep an eye on the changes being made without having to scroll through the contrib log of the bot. I also support the good suggestion by Perhelion. Offnfopt(talk)\n\nThere is https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:ListFiles?limit=500&user=GifTagger&ilshowall=1 but I can also create a custom log page if you want me to. --McZusatz (talk)\n\n@Billinghurst: If you have any issues with the Bot, please raise them. --McZusatz (talk)\n\n@McZusatz: My issue was that the bot was deleting images, not that it was running an image generator. The bot and this community should not be overriding how the communities have placed and are managing their inclusions. Commons is a central repository, not a determinator. If a community has and chooses to use a gif, then leave their image alone, and just do your conversion. If you wish to discuss with the communities about your bot and its actions then start an RFC and invite these communities to join the conversation. The means exists. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThe \"non-greyscale color table\" bot comment is due to giving non-transparent greyscale GIFs lower priority for conversion (i.e. not to be replaced without a further round of discussion at a future date), because of the fact that PNG thumbnailing for many years was significantly worse at resizing opaque grayscale PNGs than GIF thumbnailing is at resizing opaque grayscale GIFs -- and also various developer comments which have led to suspicions that improving PNG resizing in this area is not a WMF priority, and in fact that the very belated partial progress which was finally made in such PNG resizing could actually be reversed if WMF developers choose to adopt image software with some nifty features in other areas. See the discussion at Commons:Bots/Requests/GifTagger... -- AnonMoos (talk)\n\nI will again emphasise to administrators and bureaucrats that it is not the job of Commons to set the standard that the sister wikis use, nor to think that we impose componentry on these wikis, they are their own bosses. This is the central repository that is used by all the wikis to make the images available to all wikis. We determine that files are within copyright, and that the files are within scope. More than that should be taken up with the wikis where we asked for them to come and contribute not enforce our opinion from limited conversations, in limited corners of Wikimedia. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nFWIW, its really easy to make MediaWiki render non-animated gifs as PNG files, if there was wide agreement that that was the right thing to do. Bawolff (talk)\n\nImo there is no reason not to create PNG thumbnails of all still GIFs instead of obviously broken GIF thumbnails. --McZusatz (talk)\n\n@AnonMoos: Would you oppose serving non-animaged greyscale GIF images as PNG thumbnails as well? --McZusatz (talk)\n\n@AnonMoos and McZusatz: It still actually does not answer the intended reality of why that person actually edited/changed the images. But, in reality the Wikimedia rules or norms state the better the image, the better it is accepted in the Wiki community. Technically PNG images are always better than Gif images. Also, most Wikipedia chemistry articles have molecular arrangements as either a PNG or SVG image. So this person does have a point on the reason for converting it. But, I still do agree with the actions taken by the admins, for blocking the User since he/she should have talked or had a discussion before changing the images all of a sudden. @GifTagger: All wikis are communities were changes should be discussed before hand. From the friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nHi, I see a problem concerning many categories below the Category:Photographs by camera manufacturer.\n\nAn instance: A ship in Taiwan file is Taken with Leica V-Lux 4, and therefore in the Category:Wetzlar, a town in Germany.\n\nWhy?\n\nCategory:Taken with Leica V-Lux 4 is in\n\nCategory:Photos taken with Leica in\n\nCategory:Leica cameras in\n\nCategory:Leica that's a\n\nCategory:Companies based in Wetzlar located in\n\nCategory:Wetzlar\n\n2013 we had a discussion in the german Commons-forum and User:H-stt told me to remove the meta categories from the Camera categories, but over the years this was reverted and so did User:Ghouston on 27th of June with all the \"taken with Leica\"-Categories, although I inserted the {{Cat see also}}-Template in all categories.\n\nI know, it's a problem in principle and so I wanted to hear your opinion about a solution. I won't act as an editwarrior, but I must admit that I am very unsatisfied with this situation. Kind regards, --Emha (talk)\n\nI still believe that the appropriate solution is to delete each and every \"taken with\"-cat. They mess up the category system and destroy valuable search functions. A more gentle solution would be to keep those cats but remove their top-cats from the cat branch of the camera-cats. That is because these cats categorize images, not cameras, which is why they must not be in the camera-cats. --h-stt !?\n\nI think this is a misunderstanding of the category system. The relationship between a parent category and its subcategories is not necessarily \"is a type of\" or \"located at\". Thus a picture of a Leica camera is not necessarily taken in Wetzlar. Maybe the camera was made there, or maybe not. The pictures taken by the Leica cameras are then one more step removed. This happens throughout the category system. For example, what does File:Gravity escapement.gif have to do with Category:St Albans Cathedral? It's actually in a subcategory via Category:Burials at Saint Albans Cathedral, Hertfordshire and Category:Edmund Beckett Denison. --ghouston (talk)\n\nThat's actually a huge problem: We currently have no means to define the kind of relation between a (sub-) category and it's mother-category. The result is a chaotic network that next to impossible to grasp for any search function. COM:Structured data, though aimed at meta data other than content description in it's initial phase, could provide us with the necessary tools to define different types of relationships. --El Grafo (talk)\n\n(Edit conflict) That's a general problem of our category system. There are numerous other examples that do not include \"taken with\" categories – I remember pictures of tennis matches showing up in the Category:Aviation subtree because they took place in a stadium that was named after someone who was related to someone who was a pilot (or similar). Movin the \"taken with\" categories to a separate subtree wouldn't solve the issue. We'd have to dissect the whole category system into single branches of \"by location\", \"by author/manufacturer/…\", \"by date/time/period\", \"by color\", \"by taxon/type/series…\", \"by ID\", etc. and use a search function that is capable to do proper intersections. I'd say it's impossible to do a conversion like that on the fly, but conversion to COM:Structured data looks like the way to do it. Then we could finally get rid of stupid constructions like Category:Women by country by century by occupation as well. --El Grafo (talk)\n\nSorry about the conflict. Yes, there are really multiple categorisation schemes that are independent, such as subjects, dates and locations. Combining them into ad-hoc intersection categories gives weird things like the ones I mentioned at Commons:Village_pump/Archive/2013/10#Category_madness_in_Hong_Kong. --ghouston (talk)\n\n(Edit conflict) Ghouston, have you ever read Commons:Categories? The branch Category:Image sources is different from the Category:Topics, the how was the image made is not the same as what does the image show.\n\nTo stay at the given instance: This page lists all new files uploaded in the Category:Mittelhessen (including Category:Wetzlar). It doesn't work anymore if a ship in Taiwan is listed there.\n\nPlease don't argue with other miscategorized files, I know that there are many, but I seek a solution for the given ones. Regards, --Emha (talk)\n\nWell, image sources are where the images were taken from, and it seems a bit different to how images were made. Perhaps you could argue that \"hidden\" categories are only for maintenance and shouldn't be part of the Topics category tree. However there's no policy for that, and hidden categories like Category:People by name fit into the topical tree without any problem. It's also logical that the \"taken with\" categories are associated with the cameras they refer to. My example of the Gravity escapement image was not to demonstrate miscategorization but to suggest that the category system varies in how categories are related to their subcategories. --ghouston (talk)\n\nI don't know anything about User:OgreBot/gallery. Perhaps there is some way (or should be some way) of excluding particular subcategories. I don't think you'd want anything in Category:Leica included. --ghouston (talk)\n\nNote: Commons:Categories#Major categories mentions Category:Image sources as a root category, which is wrong: it's a sub-category of the root categories Category:Media types and Category:Media by source. I'll change Commons:Categories#Major categories to reflect reality (put Category:Media by source in the place of Category:Image sources). Doesn't have to do anything with this discussion, just noting it here to avoid confusion. --El Grafo (talk)\n\n(Edit conflict) User:Ghouston, the technical source of the named images is the camera, what else?\n\nIt doesn't make sense of dealing with the symptoms if the cause isn't removed.\n\nSure I want the Leica-Category and her content in this category, it's a company based in Wetzlar with a rich history including all the cameras that are produced here, but not the images of the cameras, because they are from elsewhere... Regards, --Emha (talk)\n\nBut then what about similar things like Category:Photographs by lens or Category:Photographs by film? \"source\" doesn't really make sense there and it doesn't really fit the description at Commons:Categories. If anything, I'd rather have a new root category for stuff like that. --El Grafo (talk)\n\nThe cause is varying relationships between categories and their subcategories, so that the relationship of a category with its grandparent etc., categories is unclear. A big part of it in this case is caused by putting the whole Leica company under Wetzlar. The relationship is \"based in\", I suppose meaning that its head office is located there. However Leica now makes at least some of its cameras in China [2] and it has shops and offices in other countries [3]. --ghouston (talk)\n\nYes, there are several root categories or entry points. But I don't think it's possible to separate them entirely. Simple example: Category:Photographs is in the root categories\n\nCategory:Media types through Category:Images\n\nCategory:Topics through Category:Photography and Category:Art media\n\n--El Grafo (talk)\n\nYes, it is a problem with understanding our category system, but it is not me who misunderstands the categories. We use categories in a hierarchical tree. We don't use tags! That's actually all you need to understand about our categories and why this is a problem. --h-stt !?\n\n@H-stt: I don't know what exactly it is, but the category system at Commons is certainly not a tree, as sub-categories can have multiple parent categories and it contains loops that (indirectly) make categories their own sub-categories. Commons:Categories calls it a en:Directed acyclic graph, but in reality even that is more like wishful thinking because of all the loops … --El Grafo (talk)\n\nWhat is deeply troubling here is these two things:\n\nthat we have an admin who not only doesn’t understand the underlying approach of our categorization scheme, but also comes to the Village Pump making a spectacle of it and demanding a “solution”, and\n\nthat we have another admin who comes to the Village Pump to promote what would amount to vandalism were it perpetrated by an IP user («the appropriate solution is to delete each and every \"taken with\"-cat»).\n\n-- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nTuvalkin: This is not the Administrators' noticeboard and not an admin-relevant cause. This is the village pump and I am not talking as an admin, but as a normal user like you.\n\nI would be pleased if it would be possible to you not arguing personally but along the facts. And yes, I have a problem with the situation and would be glad if we could find a solution for this. If all the other users would have told me, that this is only my problem, that's okay for me, too. But as you can read, that's not the case. Regards, --Emha (talk)\n\nWell, if we are looking for a solution for your gallery problem, it seems that User:OgreBot/gallery does have a facility for excluding subcategories. If you don't want to exclude Category:Leica, at least exclude Category:Leica cameras. --ghouston (talk)\n\nUser:Ghouston, thanks, but I know how to cure the symptoms but that's not the only concerned case and that doesn't heal the problem in principle. --Emha (talk)\n\n@User:Emha: Categorization system of wiki projects is (since its beginning) designed as multifactorial, comprising many types of categorization relations to one interconnected modular complex. The main your problem is not the categorization system nor specific categories about cameras but your baseless assumptions about the system. The categorization tree here can be never supposed as a simple hyponymic hierarchy, nor a simple meronymic hierarchy. If we would extract pure hyponymic or pure meronymic threads from the categorization structure, wee need to mark a type of relation to every one category relation and filter such threads using these additional marks. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nUser talk:ŠJů: baseless assumptions? I read on Commons:Categories: The main principles are: Hierarchic principle.. And a ship in Taiwan is not situated in the city of Wetzlar. It's that simple. If you don't agree to this you have to discuss about changing this official policy of Commons. --Emha (talk)\n\nMulti-hierarchic principle. Not only simple location hierarchy principle. The hierarchy is compound and incorporates many other kinds of relations than only current location. Categorization at wiki projects was allways multifactorial and allways supposed to combine more and very different types of relations. If it uses also relations as \"originate from\", \"registered in\", \"produced by/in\" etc., then, logically, we cannot suppose that every categorization thread will correspond with immediate spatial meronymy. If you don't agree to this you have to discuss about changing the basic principles of all Wikimedia wiki projects, or rather to create your own project which would be not based on them. There exist two ways to comply with your assumptions: to choose a simple-criterion system instead of the current all-embracing complex categorization, or to make the current system more sophisticated (using a thread filter by kind of relation). However, if you want to propose an alternative system, you should well understand the current system at first. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nElectronics Categories\n\nThis problem is happening a lot with consumer electronics images, something should be done about this problem. From the friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nComputer Categories\n\nSame problem is happening, a simple computer model will lead u to the country where the computer manufacture headquarters are located in the categories. From the friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nScanner Categories\n\nLaying aside the obvious matter that not all category relations are is-a relations, I still have a problem with some of this \"taken with\" stuff. For example, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Mr._Bouatier_working_on_meter,_1954.jpg&curid=30755448&diff=164488000&oldid=149609367, as discussed in part at User_talk:BotAdventures#Scanner.... It seems pretty silly to say that a 1954 photo was \"taken with\" an Epson scanner. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWell, that should obviously be something like Photographs digitized with … and separate from photographs taken using a scanner as a camera … --El Grafo (talk)\n\nYou can digitize books, digitize photos, and image/digitize 3D objects with either a camera or a scanner. I'm not sure that creating separate categories for all these possibilities for every type of device is a good idea. I think there should be device categories (which will later be converted to Wikidata-like properties if Structured data ever happens) which can be assigned automatically from Exif in many cases. A single file can potentially have more than one device, e.g., the original camera, the scanner, or software that processes it (e.g., for enhancements or processing raw camera images), although sometimes only one can found in Exif. Any other information, e.g., that it's a book digitization, or a photo of a 3D object made by a scanner, can be added separately instead of creating intersections with the device type. --ghouston (talk)\n\nFrom time to time, I find out-of-copyright images, such as old postcards, on eBay. There's one above. It would be handy to have a tool or script that will do the upload, capturing the appropriate metadata, like we have for Flickr. Does anyone know of one? Andy Mabbett (talk)\n\nNot as far as I know. eBay has their own API, however as users can upload many photographs of objects, auction entries may be for multiple items and most sections of the auction page can be used in varied custom fashions by the seller, I think useful automation is a bit of a nightmare. Were I designing a tool, I would provide a webform, harvest details and then let the user fill in the blanks or correct details (like selecting which image is the relevant one to upload from a drop-list). All in all, it's a weak scenario compared to Flickr, where the API is explicitly returning fields about an image you want to upload, not information about what it may represent, tangential events, or as part of a group object.\n\nP.S. Flickr upload tools are a bit of a hazard for mass uploads, however I'm reading your request as a tool for item by item uploads, not mass uploads. --Fæ (talk)\n\nYes; item by item. A pre-filled form would be fine - anything that removes a step or two from the drudgery. Andy Mabbett (talk)\n\n@Fæ: Idea: would you consider automatically submitting the eBay page to one of the web citation websites when your form is used? Eventually, the eBay link goes away and sometimes the licensing is questionable without being able to see it. Example: if a postcard is uploaded with the claim that it was published pre-1978 with no copyright notice and all we have is the front of the postcard, it's difficult to know that the license is valid because we can't see the back to verify that there is no copyright notice on there. But if the eBay link was preserved, then we could see the other side of the postcard and verify that there was no notice ... or we could see that the seller never provided a copy of the other side of the postcard, in which case it should be nominated for deletion. --B (talk)\n\nYes, auto-archiving the page would be possible, within whatever usage limits there are for the service. It may mean a bit more cookie-fiddling and a wrapped-in or popped-up human-check or similar jiggery pokery.\n\nSorry if my text above might be misleading, but I do not have the volunteer time to do this as a project, my real life commitments are likely to be a bit overwhelming for several more months (believe me, I would *much* rather be playing code monkey than handle the depressing stuff I'm going through). Anyway, though I can do this sort of API experiment, I'm actually rather hacky/bad and slow at it, and I have a big guilty secret backlog of projects I ought to return to and finish off. My description above was how I would initially think about it, with the hope that someone faster and smarter would have a crack at it. --Fæ (talk)\n\nUser:We hope has a personal method of uploading a preliminary image which shows evidence for lack of a copyright statement, then overwriting it with another image with only shows the area of real interest...

Try chunked uploading instead. --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Slick (talk)\n\nHi, On every file available from the Library of Congress, there are a 8-bit and a 16-bit TIFF files (e.g. [4]). I usually upload the TIFF (by URL) before uploading a JPEG version because downloading from WM servers is much faster (x10) than from LoC servers. ;o) The TIFF much be converted to JPEG (8-bit), so is there any interest to upload the 16-bit TIFF file? I do the conversion with Gimp, which only handles 8-bit. The 16-bit file is always available on LoC. So? Regards, Yann (talk)\n\nHow about just uploading tiffs? --Jarekt (talk)\n\n@Jarekt: You mean not uploading JPEG? Or uploading both 8-bit and 16-bit files? Also noteworthy is that the TIFF files are Adobe RGB. So I convert them to sRGB before uploading JPEG here. Regards, Yann (talk)\n\nI've actually recently come across another similar with LoC images.... from bulk uploads by Fae (not that I am faulting him, at all)... Photochrom images that were available from the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division directly in full-resolution as TIFF and JPEG, but also available (and uploaded separately) as lower resolution PNGs from the World Digital Library (which is a project run by the LoC). I'm tempted to nominated the lower res PNGs as duplicates, except that they are from a different 'exact' source, and not the same format. Examples:\n\nFile:Mosque of Abder-Rhaman, Algiers, Algeria-LCCN2001697807.tif (8.32 Megapixel TIFF)\n\nFile:Mosque of Abder-Rhaman, Algiers, Algeria-LCCN2001697807.jpg (8.32 Megapixel JPEG)\n\nFile:Mosque of Abder-Rahman, Algiers, Algeria WDL2450.png (1.41 Megapixel PNG)\n\nAs you can see, the World Digital Library PNG is far lower res. Revent (talk)\n\nI'd say upload 16-bit if there is any useful information that would be lost by conversion to 8-bit, which would usually be the case. (Images with a substantial amount of noise wouldn't benefit from 16-bit. Most other scanned images would, notably anything with a compressed dynamic range, 16-bit HDR.) Anyone downloading the tiff is looking for maximum quality, while a JPEG should be \"ready to print\" or \"ready to display\" with full contrast and no HDR information. SilverbackNettalk\n\nAs I said above, the bigger TIFF is always available on LoC. The question is: \"is there any use for it on Commons?\" Yann (talk)\n\nWe don't know that it will always be available on the LoC. One scholar working on the Manhattan Project was complaining about scores of publicly available documents whose websites disappeared or stopped working, or in one case were corrupted by an ill-advised line-feed conversion. Not intentional, but there wasn't the budget and/or will to fix it. Maybe the LoC as library will be better, but one change and they could be made inaccessible indefinitely.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nAre protections like that allowed? It looks like kinda disrespect to common communication practices from my point of view. --Base (talk)\n\nI can understand, but semi-protection should be sufficient. Also a link to COM:AN would be useful. @Jameslwoodward: Jim? Regards, Yann (talk)\n\n@Base, what is so hard to understand with \"I will be on vacation, away from the Internet, through the first week in August\"? If he hadn't protected his talkpage, then after 3 or 4 postings, the next poster wouldn't notice Jim's \"absence message\" and might become angry when he gets no answer. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nWell in ukwiki we had a user who won't reply if you forgot to greet him when writing to him. He referred to need of respect but in that way actually disrespected community members who could just forget to say \"Hi\" because were thinking about other, more important atm stuff. It looks like a case of the same kind in some way. Are you really sure that a poster who doesn't get answer and fails to read the notice (though with some CSS you can do that a block of text sticks to the screen which probably solves the possible problem you mentioned in much better way than protection, IMHO) will be more angry than a would-be-poster who will not be able even post because of the protection? For example, in my case of TP use practice I'd rather write something on TP and get answer in several months because of the addressee vacation rather than I'm stopped from writing now and forget the thing I wanted to say in the months. Well not that I'm a typical case but I'm not too peculiar to neglect. (Just to clarify I didn't have anything to write the user now, just saw the action in WL and it drew my attention.) --Base (talk)\n\nJim should be aware that he won't get deletion notifications. -- Rillke(q?)\n\n@Base: The answer is unambiguously no, Jim went against Commons:Protection policy which limits page protection of this type to \"vandalism and edit wars\". --Fæ (talk)\n\nTúrelio has my reason exactly -- in the past I have been away for much shorter periods and have had angry messages because I did not respond. Of course an experienced user would look at my contributions and see that I had not been on Commons since before he left the message, but novices just get mad. Therefore, I thought that it would be better to prevent novices from leaving messages.\n\nHowever, I'll be perfectly happy with whatever Yann and Turelio decide. BTW, Rillke, I am well aware that I won't get deletion notifications, but I've never had one and I think I can safely say that my present 500 or 600 uploads are all safe from valid DRs. And now, I really am gone until August. . Jim . . . . (Jameslwoodward) (talk to me)\n\nTalk page protection is unnecessary as many people including me watching his page. If something unexpected happens, we can manage it (like replying to an angry novice). I think Yann or Túrelio can unprotect it now. Jee\n\nI changed it to semi-protection. Regards, Yann (talk)\n\nJuly 05\n\nI'm just curious if there is any type of policy against pages that display a large number of images? I was looking at the \"What links here\" page for some of my uploads and came across pages similar to the \"[[User:Josve05a/Possible DRs/2015 May]]\" page. This page displays 2974 thumbnail images on the same page. This IMO is a waste of server-side and client-side resources. Offnfopt(talk)\n\nThere are a lot of such pages, and even some uploading software - as Commonist and Vicuna -routinely create user galleries, and as far as I know no problem has even arisen except for loading time. Dividing such pages into smaller pages wouldn't spare server resources. Probably making smaller galleries is a good practice, but not a mandatory rule to be enforced.--Pere prlpz (talk)\n\nIt's not a waste of client-side resources unless people are viewing them, at which the question might involved the client-side resources involved in splitting them up and having to deal with many pages instead of one. It's not a waste of server-side resources again unless they're being loaded, in which case, 2974 thumbnail loads is probably a drop in the bucket in the world of Wikimedia. It's all false optimization.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nParsing pages with that many thumbnails takes a while (So, there might be some latency on rendering the page). Thus I wouldn't recommend doing that for any page meant to be regularly viewed, as it will be slow to load for the user. Beyond that I wouldn't worry. Bawolff (talk)\n\nI agree with User:Bawolff, it realm is not something that one should worry about. On, any Wiki there are pages with thousands of images. Also, if one does a search, they will see many images in one page, thus indicating that there is no need to set a limo to how many images can a specific page can have. Doing such a limit may have actually some adverse affects to the efficiency of this site even. From, the very friendly Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nHi all, this is Scott (Russavia).

Blue Rasberry (talk)\n\nCategory:Memorials currently redirects to Category:Monuments and memorials in unidentified countries. I understand the choice -- it means that if someone adds the superseded Category:Memorials, things will be recategorized by a bot into a place appropriate to future work -- but it seems a bit bizarre. After all, it will put that \"unidentified countries\" category on something where the category may be perfectly well identified by another category or by the description. Shouldn't this just redirect to Category:Monuments and memorials? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI agree with your assessment. Sure, stuff shouldn't be put directly into Category:Memorials, but that is easy to fix. The redirect is just weird. --Sebari (talk)\n\nYes, if you type \"Memorials\" into the search box, you get this redirect. I suggest reverting the last edit by User:Butko. --ghouston (talk)\n\nIt actually is not right even, its like saying why even give a name to a memorial, if people are only going to call it a memorial. Even the 9/11 memorial is redirecting to memorial. From, the very friendly Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nOK, changed to redirect to Category:Monuments and memorials. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI feel the UTC-Time gadget is sending some users 4 hours back in time, according to the gadget.

Thank you in advance. From the very friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nIt's just a bit of JavaScript[5] that gets the current time from your own computer. It's working for me (currently 23:18:48). I guess you already checked that the time on your computer is right. --ghouston (talk)\n\nWhat is your local time offset from UTC by the way? Is it related at all to the 4 hours? --ghouston (talk)\n\nThen they should not even name it a UTC-Time gadget and call it a local time gadget. It can confuse someone. Also, another thing about this gadget, is that, there should be a option for 24-hour or a 12-hour mode. From, the very friendly Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\nIt's called UTC-Time because it displays the time in UTC. However it assumes that JavaScript that calls the API for UTC time on your computer will get the right value. If you set your own computer to the wrong time, or maybe set it to display the right local time but with the wrong timezone, it will give the wrong answer. --ghouston (talk)\n\nJuly 06\n\nAt the moment the categories concerning ambulances and other medical emergency vehicles are kind of a mess. This is mainly due to differing systems around the world, but also due to unclear terms. Therefore I would like to develop a meaningful, sensible structure with consistent names for those kinds of vehicles. Here is a first stab at it for discussion, mainly from a German perspective:\n\nEmergency medical service vehicles - base cat\n\nEmergency medical service vehicles by country\n\n...\n\nEmergency medical service vehicles by type\n\nAmbulances - road vehicles designed to transport patients (in Germany those would be further divided into KTWs, RTWs, and NAWs)\n\nMobile intensive care units -\n\nfurther cats for special ambulance types\n\nFirst responder vehicles - vehicles to transport Certified First Responders and similar personell\n\nEmergency physician vehicles - vehicles to transport emergency physicians to an emergency, but not fitted to transport patients\n\nEmergency medical service helicopters\n\npossibly sub-divided\n\nAmbulance buses\n\nAmbulance boats\n\nAmbulance bikes\n\n...\n\nfurther special cats, for example for media types, models, in special situations or whatever comes up\n\nAny comments, especially perspectives from other countries? -- Sebari (talk)\n\nThe current categorization is relatively clear and logical, i can see no extra mess there. The fact that the \"basic\", \"default\", \"prototypical\" kind of ambulance vehicles, i.e. ambulance automobiles (vans), have not its special subcategory, is a usual phenomenon which have its reasons (similarly, \"electric trams\" are considered as the default kind of tram, but horse-, steam-, gas- or flywheel- or treadle-powered trams are categorized under trams). However, special subcategories for \"Ambulance automobiles\" can be created if needed.\n\nTo reserve the name \"Ambulances\" ONLY for ambulance automobiles and exclude other ambulance vehicles from it is not a good idea. Such a solution would cause a big mess and inconsistency in the categorization. Generally, ambulance automobiles are no more and no less ambulatory than ambulance boats, buses, motorcycles, Segways, helicopters etc.\n\nTo separate emergency vehicles by more detailed purpose (only transport of medics, only transport of patients, only a mobile first aid workplace, and all 4 possible combinations of them, i.e. 7 possibilities) would be complicated, and not reliably specifiable in some cases. IMHO categorization by kind of vehicle and by operator+country should stay preferred. More detailed categorization can be added but should not disrupt the current system.\n\nAs regards a perspective from my Czech country and my language, we use the word \"ambulance\" primarily for \"outpatient(s') department\", i.e. an office of non-hospital physician, or an outpatient service in the hospital. Ambulance cars are called \"sanitní vůz\" or \"sanitka\", literally \"sanitary vehicles\", from Latine \"sanitas\" = health, borrowed through French and German languages. However, the word \"ambulance\" is used as an \"international\" word also for emergency vehicles. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nIf you look into country-specific categories, you will notice the mess, since names like \"Rapid response vehicle\" are used for completely different purposes. Sometimes is a super-cat for all kinds of emergency vehicles, sometimes it is a sub-cat for a specialized kind of vehicle. Or categories are not very clear. In my opinion, differentiating between different ambulance types makes a lot of sense. In Germany there is a clear distinction between RTWs, NAWs, KTWs, FRs, and NEFs, for example, and they are categorized as such. Similar distinctions exist in other countries, and a common hierarchy tree would be useful. I don't care particularly how the cats are named, though. I was just using Ambulance here, since it fits the definition as used on en Wikipedia: An ambulance is a vehicle for transportation of sick or injured people to, from or between places of treatment for an illness or injury, ... --Sebari (talk)\n\n@ŠJů: You say 'we use the word \"ambulance\" primarily for \"outpatient(s') department\"', but don't say what the actual word is in Czech. Is it really a cognate of \"ambulance\", not \"ambulatory\" (etymologically \"capable of walking\"), a word that also has that exact meaning in English? - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: As I know, the word \"ambulance\" was used for field hospitals originally. Afterwards, the meaning was transferred to various civil medical \"terrain services\". I was asked about \"perspectives from other countries\", and I answered to it. However, I'm not sure that the meaning of the word in English is so exact as you claim. As I can read in the enwiki article, the term cover various kinds of vehicles and varous their purposes, some of them are closer to the prototypical core of the meaning, some of them are peripheral or specific. That's the main problem of the proposal above.\n\n@Srittau: Regrettably, the most definite aspect of your proposal was to exclude ambulance boats, bikes, buses and helicopters from the current category \"Ambulances\" - so actually, to narrow its meaning to ambulance automobiles only, and to cover its current meaning with a new category Emergency medical service vehicles. Such a change is very controversial and maybe illogical and counterproductive.\n\nIf you have some other specific proposal, it should be clear and well-founded.\n\nAs I can see, you propose to replace the current name \"Rapid response vehicles\" with your name \"First responder vehicles\". You can open a discussion at the discussion page of that category by a {{Move}} proposal, invite its creator and users to it, and bring some convincing arguments for the proposal. Why you consider your term as more worldwide universal, more unambiguous, more correct, more understandable etc. If you mean that some of the country subcategories deviates from the scope of the root category, you can correct it (move the wrong categorized files) or open a discussion with the users who filled that specific category.\n\nIf you will have some other specific and well-founded proposal or idea (e.g. to create a subcategory thread of Mobile intensive care units, you can implement (or discuss) it without disruption or question of the current basic structure. As regards etymological anchoring of the word \"ambulance\", IMHO it can cover all three purposes of these vehicles as mentioned above, and the 3 purposes can be variously combined. E.g. every emergency ambulance should be able to be used as a mobile intensive care unit, but not all intensive care units are intended to transport patients. Non-emergency transport vehicles can fall under the term \"ambulances\" also. The text of the enwiki article is a bit longer than your qutotation. Moreover, there exist special emergency vehicles for transport of blood, transplants etc. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nAs I said above, I don't care about the exact names for now. The problem is that \"Rapid response vehicles\" as currently used is not the same as \"First responder vehicles\". Sometimes it is used as such, sometimes it isn't. And that is the core problem we have at the moment: no consistent naming and no documentation of said naming. So, in a first step, let's step back from names and just consider the following structure:\n\nBase cat for ambulance or whatever vehicles\n\nBy country cats\n\n...\n\nBy type cats\n\nCat for about van-sized road vehicles designed to transport patients (in Germany those would be further divided into KTWs, RTWs, and NAWs)\n\ncats for special types of those vehicles\n\nCat for vehicles that transport Certified First Responders and similar personell\n\nCat for vehicles that transport emergency physicians to an emergency, but not fitted to transport patients\n\nHelicopters (yay!)\n\npossibly sub-divided\n\nBuses\n\nBoats\n\nBikes\n\n...\n\nfurther special cats, for example for media types, models, in special situations or whatever comes up\n\nLet's work on that structure first, then agree on names. --Sebari (talk)\n\nYou mix two criteria together in the \"by type\" section. Type of vehicle is one thing, purpose of vehicle is a different thing. By type of vehicle we can distinguish road and terrain vehicles (automobiles, vans, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bikes, Segways, snowmobiles, snowcats...), aircraft (at first helicopters) and watercraft (boats).\n\nAs regards \"by purpose\" (by function) criterion, we can distinguish (and combine) emergency/non-emergency transport of medics, emergency/non-emergency transport of patients, emergency/non-emergency transport of medical equipment and material, and mobile \"treatment rooms\". However, this sorting partly follows from the categorization by type of vehicle. Cars, motorcycles or bicycles are mostly intended for transport of the medic. Van-sized road vehicles are mostly multi-purpose, usable for all these purposes. The purpose can also follow from the operator: emergency service have emergency vehicles only, hospitals can operate non-emergency transport vehicles etc.\n\nThe categorization structure exists already. If you want to improve it, you should bring specific and considered proposals of specific and needed changes - to rename or merge a category, to create a new subcategory, to change categorization of an existing category etc. We not build the categorization on a greenfield site. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nThe structure does not exist or at least I can not see it. As pointed out several times now, naming throughout the cat tree is not consistent. The same term is used for different things. If you disagree, please go ahead and add meaningful descriptions to the existing categories, so we know what they mean. For example, what exactly is a Rapid response vehicle? Above you claimed it is the same as a first responder vehicle. But if you take a look at the category you will see that it is contains lots of sub-cats that do not fit my description above. So, what is it then? We have at least a documentation problem, which caused a messed structure. Therefore I see no other approach than to take a step back and work out a sensible categorization. And then look at our categorization and fix it. Just closing your eyes and claiming there is no problem does not help. --Sebari (talk)\n\nYes, there was really a problem with Rapid response vehicle - its categorization didn't correspond to their interwikis and it contained several improperly categorized subcategories. Most of these mistakes were made by Pierpao in 2011. However, the interwikis provide clear definition, and all \"true\" subcategories (by country) of that category were categorized and used properly and consistently. The problem was not a \"non-existing structure\" but only several mistakes in one category. I fixed them. Maybe, the category can be renamed to some more clear and unambiguous of the synonymic terms, but it is also a specific particular problem only.\n\nAs regards your proposal to distinguish cars of Certified First Responders from cars of other emergency physicians, you can try to do it, but you should anticipate that most of users and photographs are not able to distinguish them reliably. I even don't know which is relation between Certified First Responder and Ambulance emergency response vehicle, though I checked the articles. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nHello, is there by any chance a tool, similar to cat-a-lot, with which I can change the description of multiple images at once? That would be very helpful for Wiki Loves Earth, because sometimes there are 10 different images from the same place. Thanks in advance, --Лорд Бъмбъри (talk) .\n\nYou could possibly use COM:VFC for the purpose, if you are simply replacing one block to text with another. Revent (talk)\n\n@Revent: How can your utc time stamp for June 30, be 19 hour, when my UTC Wikmedia gadget displays 18 hour still. where did the hour go? Did I go back in time. Places check mark on discoveries to make \"go back in time. Check\". Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\n@Doorknob747: It's a mystery, lol. My timestamp (just checked it) matches both the UTC time gadget, and a quick check against a network time server. Revent (talk)\n\n@Revent: Sure is a mystery, now its 4 hours behind, that is after 5 days, its like as if the clock is slowing down, in the gadget on the top right corner of the page.

From the friendly, Doorknob 747 (talk) :D\n\n@Doorknob747: I don'y know exactly how that gadget works, but I would assume it's based on local javascript... try clearing cache and see if that fixes it. Revent (talk)\n\nAll the hard work seems to have been done, but could we have a version that removes all the scary stuff about deletion. There is often much work to be done in the {{Information}} tag, other than date, source and permission. I am particularly interested in the description= field. For example, in an upload from a museum, all images are often labelled Item in Hogwarts Museum. Running through this, image by image, I could identify each item in my speciality, making the image usable in future articles. Similarly, If we are talking about one museum I could add to all images a geotag. These are late night tasks done when the brain has turned off. A Batch rename may be more complex to do- but the ability to rename a group of images to something more specific, or correct a title error would be useful. But even the simple facility to add a English translation of a foreign language description would be useful. I suppose the answer is to download the .js file and tweak it- but that is also very scary! --ClemRutter (talk)\n\nIs it just me, or has the option for rendering SVG images as PNGs disappeared? On SVG file pages, there used to be a line of text saying something like \"this image as a PNG\", and then links to PNGs of varying sizes. But now I can't seem to find this. Zacwill16 (talk)\n\nIt's just you. On the description page for (e.g.) File:Bulletin Board with notes.svg the line says \"Size of this preview: 800 × 568 pixels. Other resolutions: 320 × 227 pixels | 640 × 454 pixels | 1,024 × 727 pixels | 1,280 × 908 pixels.\" All links point to PNGs. --Magnus (talk)\n\nThat's not what I was talking about. Below that, there were options for 200px, 500px, 1000px and 2000px. Zacwill16 (talk)\n\nThose were added by JS, not mediawiki. Maybe somebody disabled the gadget. Bawolff (talk)\n\nYes and no, this was (not a gadget) fully in the Common.js and was simply removed as deprecated because of redundant. ↔ User: Perhelion (Commons: = crap?)\n\nI would like an entry box in the image description page so you can enter the desired width and then the new PNG is rendered in the new tab. This is easier than copying and pasting the PNG link to a new tab and then change the width value in the URL. Ideally there should be a PNG link with the same dimension as the SVG source. -- Sameboat - 同舟 (talk · contri.)\n\nHow was it redundant? I found it useful and convenient. Zacwill16 (talk)\n\n@Zacwill16 as sayed above, there is already a line with the same function but other resolutions. So your \"useful and convenient\" are the different resolutions 200, 500, 1000, 2000? If yes I agree Sameboat to implement an input field for an variable size!? Open a Phab task or made an new Common.js hack for this? ↔ User: Perhelion (Commons: = crap?)\n\nYes, those resolutions are larger and more workable. Zacwill16 (talk)\n\nI don't think the currently available widths in the line of \"other resolutions\" suffice unless either one happens to be the size of your screen. Also Gnome/librsvg is slightly inaccurate in rendering SVG text when the resultant PNG resolution isn't identical to the \"nominal\" dimension of the SVG source or multiplied by integer. Still it's something can be easily overcome without introducing new JS, if you know how it works, but I think most editors don't. -- Sameboat - 同舟 (talk · contri.)\n\nWhen did we stop being able to manipulate a url ? Do we really need buttons for everything ? —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nBTW, you can always discuss, find new defaults that will work for all users (not just SVGs on Commons) and file a ticket with a request to consider adapting the current defaults. But the gadget is no longer needed for sure, and having it adds unnecessary lines in the page, flashes in the rendering, code and maintenance burden. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nIs it reasonable then to ask at Commons:Village pump/Proposals for higher resolution entries in this list (preferably up to a size that can be used to judge FPs and offers reasonable detail, around 6MP)? — Julian H.✈\n\nThese additional options were added by MediaWiki:Common.js - @TheDJ: Not everyone likes working with URLs, especially if they are not straightforward like http://commonsupload.com/w_50px/image_name.ext - I agree they were mostly redundant and if other options (larger ones) are required, this should be discussed on the village pump. Perhaps MediaWiki could be more awesome in general; instead of providing these links, it could be a dropdown like MediaViewer (but including a free-form input option) for viewing and downloading. -- Rillke(q?)\n\nInfo (EC) On en.wikipedia, the script at en:MediaWiki:Common.js/file.js was deleted, whereas in de.wikipedia it's still contained in de:MediaWiki:Common.js (and working).

Deprecated - yes, if a function is aviable in mw the unneeded js hack can be removed without discussion. However, i haven't noticed that the new mwfeature is 100% similar to the js hack. Sorry for that. --Steinsplitter (talk)\n\nLarge fraction of images uploaded without any license use {{OTRS Pending}} instead. See for example here or here. For years I have been tagging such files with {{No license}} under assumption that COM:LIC requires all files to have a license template and uploaders should not be uploading new files unless they know under what license files are released, since the release might not be under license allowed on Commons. Unfortunately the COM:LIC policy does not mention OTRS, and COM:OTRS is more like guidelines instead of policy and it also does not deal with issue of WHEN is the license needed. Over the years I had a lot of discussions with confused uploaders, some new and some very experienced admins from other projects who were advising for years that license can be added after OTRS permission is processed. Lately User:JuTa was removing {{No license}} tags like here leading to this discussion. For me that is a sign that we do need clarifications to our current policies so we all follow the same rule book. As I see it our options are:\n\nTag all images without a license with {{No license}}, even the ones that claim {{OTRS Pending}}. Such files will be often deleted after 7 days.\n\nLeave files alone and after 30 days {{OTRS Pending}} will begin displaying {{No permission since}} which will lead to deletion after additional 7 days. This option would cause files to remain without license for 37 days before it is deleted.\n\nCreate some new processing pathway\n\n--Jarekt (talk)\n\nFrom a Commons policy perspective, and based on pragmatic experience as a OTRS volunteer and Commons contributor, I believe that Commons should adopt processes that disregard off-wiki correspondence about the possible copyright status of a file, until the point when a specific statement has been verified. Waiting for over a month for what may be damaging copyright violations to be removed, especially photographs of people or the recently deceased, is unacceptable. The OTRS pending template can be added by anyone, including those that may deliberately use this as a back-door for the Commons system to get images into high profile Wikipedia articles (noting that Wikipedians should be able to assume that images from Commons are at a more reliable free copyright status that on other projects). If anything we should focus on improving the undeletion work-flow and where there are associated claims of backlogged OTRS correspondence, these are flagged or escalated for attention if the file has been deleted or is about to be deleted.\n\nWe must encourage anyone to create reasonable deletion requests even when the OTRS pending template is added, and continue to be prepared to delete files after 7 days. Administrators are supported by policy in acting to speedily delete files where, in their view, copyright claims appear in any way suspect. Procedures should not leave an Administrator unable to act, just because they do not have OTRS access. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI do have a broad OTRS access, and I often search OTRS for records related to files with {{OTRS pending}} but no license before tagging them. In majority of the cases search for the name in the \"author\" field or search for the filename does not find any hits. As for the undeletion work-flow, many such requests, especially for files originally tagged by me, end up on my talk page and are promptly undeleted. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSure it can be quick when all tools are in the same hands, the user is experienced enough to be relied on to apply their judgement and willing to be held to account afterwards. However we want to encourage more users to be active in chasing up possible copyvios, including non-admins who know enough about copyright to act, admins without OTRS access and OTRS volunteers who are not admins. Providing an easy workflow is key to gaining more helpers. Fæ (talk)\n\nHi, I think we need some common sense in these cases. I check if the claim of a permission is plausible. If yes, then waiting for about one month is fine for me. If it is just a file copied from the web without any real possibility to get a permission, then tagging them with \"no license\" or \"no permission\" is fine. Regards, Yann (talk)\n\nBut waiting for a month means that we are hosting a file with no license for a whole month before deleting it. I personally do not like it. Many people I interact with in last couple years while I was working with files with no license seem to have very little understanding of the concept of license. I have little confidence that many of them will provide proper OTRS permission form. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nQuick idea for option 3: Instead of the image, display a message like \"Coming soon … (This image is currently hidden and will appear once copyright stuff has been sorted out)\". Make a simple switch for that, accessible to admins, OTRS members and license reviewers (and let them be able to see the hidden content). Much easier to understand for newbies than deletion and undeletion, while at the same time nothing potentially copyrighted is being displayed. Would probably require a new module for MediaWiki, though … --El Grafo (talk)\n\n+1 for your idea, El Grafo. The question is if we can do this without major coding. One idea that comes to mind is the following: Overwrite the image in question with our new coming soon image, then hiding the original upload. When OTRS checks out, we can easily restore the original. Doesn't work for non-admins, tho. Might be a work-around until we find a better solution via software. Waiting a month for permission is far away from ideal, on the other hand we might kill some enthusiasm of new uploaders if we act too fast. I really like the idea El Grafo came up with. --Hedwig in Washington (mail?)\n\nYeah, might be possible to do it that way. Not sure if admins would like the additional work load, though. But I'm pretty sure implementing this into a new feature would require major coding. --El Grafo (talk)\n\nIt doesn't matter if we like it. It just needs to work... Maybe we can use a script? Ping Scriptgurus! --Hedwig in Washington (mail?)\n\nThe only place most new users see the image is on a wikipedia page replacing image on wikipedia with \"Coming soon\" image might not be popular outside of Commons. As for original idea by El Grafo, curently image can be either in deleted or undeleted state, it seems unlikely to me that software developers would create a 3rd limbo state for such a small number of images. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nTo be honest, I think every file uploaded by an inexperienced user should by default go into a \"to be checked\" state and only be publicly displayed after an experienced user has flicked a switch. Probably not gonna happen, though ;-) --El Grafo (talk)\n\nAnother idea for option 3 would be writing some new messages more specific to this situation which would be added to the file and uploder's talk page. Part of the confusion is that {{No license}} message is too broad and many users do not understand it. Tools that currently add {{No license}} could be modified to add this new message if {{OTRS pending}} is detected. The new message could be more specific about what is needed and can explain that if image is deleted than it can be easily undeleted once license is provided or OTRS is processed. We can also create a new tracking pipeline (like Category:Media without a license or Category:Media missing permission) for such images that can have a different time limit (maybe 2 weeks?). --Jarekt (talk)\n\nIf the file has {{OTRS pending}}, then I think that it is better to leave it alone, and treat it as any other OTRS pending file which is subject to deletion after a month. A file with {{OTRS pending}} with no copyright tag is better than a file with {{OTRS pending}} with a wrong tag, in particular if no permission has been granted. Someone might find the file information page and might mistakenly believe that the incorrect copyright tag applies and run into trouble when trying to use the picture somewhere. It may even be better to change the upload wizard so that no licence is selected at all if {{OTRS pending}} is used. The correct copyright tag can be added by the OTRS member when the ticket is processed.\n\nConcerning copyvios with {{OTRS pending}}, maybe there should be a special dated deletion tag which OTRS members can use if the member has been able to confirm that nothing has been sent to OTRS within a week or so - but it may be more time-efficient to simply ignore the files for a month and hunt down other copyright violations elsewhere. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nI agree that no license is better than incorrect license. I was not proposing asking people to add incorrect licenses, but to coordinate with the copyright holders BEFORE the upload so the image is uploaded with the license which will be in the Permission. I am actually not very concerned about copyvios with {{OTRS pending}}, since I do not recall running into any. My concern is with images using {{OTRS pending}} instead of a license uploaded by users that never looked as COM:OTRS who will never follow up with actually sending the permission. As long as image is on the Wikipedia page where they placed it they are happy and unaware that they need to do anything, and they will find the notifications on they talk pages only after the image is deleted and they come back to see what happen. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI'm not sure if everyone knows but Wikidata just added a couple things related to Commons. Previously they just had Commons Category (P373) and Creator (P1472), but now they also allow for linking to Galleries (P935) and Commons Institutions (P1612). I'm not sure who participates at Wikidata but wanted to pass that along. Reguyla (talk)\n\nThanks for letting us know! --Steinsplitter (talk)\n\nYes thanks, so we made this informations more public on Commons pages!? ↔ User: Perhelion (Commons: = crap?)\n\nWell its a start. The problem is this, since we can only link to one page in the otherwiki's box for commons, we now have to choose which one to link too, Category, Gallery, Insitution or Creator. We can link them all as properties to the item, but only one will be aligned to the Interwiki links under the other wiki's box. So, if a gallery exists that corresponds to an article, would we need to remove the \"category link\" from the other wiki's box and replace it with the Gallery that more directly relates? It seems reasonable to me to do that, but if we do, then it causes all the interwiki's to no longer link to the Category, so then we would need to add back any interwiki links that are appropriate to that category. So although we are getting better, there are still some problems to work through and some requirements to flush out. Reguyla (talk)\n\nThe Wikidata policy is to have separate wikidata items for articles and categories. Commons categories can only be linked to a Wikidata category item. Then you get to choose which of the other pages get to link to the wikidata article item. It's all slightly mad. --ghouston (talk)\n\nThat's all well and good but its not necessarily how its being used. And a lot of commons content hasn't been added to Wikidata yet. Reguyla (talk)\n\nYes; Wikidata advises to consider Commons gallery as a article/page and link to other articles/pages. It is a bit useless, and I need to create Lyriothemis acigastra to link at wikidata:Q2413777. I think it something Commons should decide whether category or gallery is important. I see no reason to give importance to gallery as it is not existing for all categories and the maintenance of gallery is tedious. Jee\n\nThe problem also exists that there are relatively few galleries compared to categories and galleries usually do not contain as much content as categories. Don't get me wrong, they are both good to have, but in some cases its going to be hard to choose which is the right one to link. Reguyla (talk)\n\nIt is not that simple. See for example, en:Libellulidae. Wikipedia has also en:Category:Libellulidae. So wikidata maintains wikidata:Q507694 and wikidata:Q6365089 and the second is linked to Category:Libellulidae. The first is more important; but not linked to Commons as no gallery exists. Creating a gallery for Libellulidae is nonsense as it is a wide topic. If we linked Category:Libellulidae too to wikidata:Q507694, it will become redundant. Further, it may not be possible to create duplicate entries in wikidata too. Jee\n\nGalleries for wide categories can actually be useful, as visual guides to the areas covered by the different subcategories. For example, it might be useful to have a gallery Libellulidae with a few examples from each of the genera. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nGood point, Jmabel. Currently Libellulidae is a redirect, and so wikidata will not accept such an entry. I'll try to create a page and try again. But still I'm not happy with these two \"disconnected entries\" in wikidata. I prefer a parent object linking pages and categories. Jee\n\nI completely agree, its not simple at all and there are a lot of situations like you point out. Reguyla (talk)\n\nThe funniest thing is that they've provided an \"Add links\" link on category pages, which sets up an invalid link from a category to a wikidata article item. It's hard to tell that it's invalid since the interwiki links on the category will work perfectly. Occasionally somebody on Wikidata will revert some of these links for being invalid. Setting up a \"correct\" link may involve creating a new category wikidata item and cross linking it with the article item. It's too much trouble to do manually, and the final result is poor since interwiki links won't work except to other categories. My solution is to ignore Wikidata and use [[en:foo]] if I want an interwiki link, but that's also poor because it's English only. --ghouston (talk)\n\n\"Wikidata acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects\" Maintaining two disconnected objects for a single topic (as in my example on Libellulidae) = non-structured data. Hope they will solve the issue (eg: by creating a parent object over it and keeping them as children) soon. Still then, Wikidata is not useful for Commons.Jee\n\n@Jkadavoor: Passeriformes : this is a good exemple of the usefulness of a gallery for a wide content. -- Christian Ferrer\n\nP935 is duplicate of direct Commons link for main space pages and could be deduced from category main topic for categories. Same for P373 when eliminating duplicates. --EugeneZelenko (talk)\n\nI don't think I agree. I see a need to have all 4 as separate entities but in a smart way. For example, its possible to have all 4 entities linked within a data element but that doesn't link to Commons for related interwiki's. If commons had its own Wikibox in Wikidata, rather than forcing it to use a single selection in the Other Wiki box, then we would be able to tie all 4 items to the appropriate entry on Wikidata and the interwiki's would be appropriately associated. This would also be of benefit because there would no longer be a need to link them as properties within the data element, they would be associated in the Commons Wiki Box. Reguyla (talk)\n\nIt looks to me like the Category:Sports clothing and its subcategories are now pretty much entirely disjoint from the descendants of Category:Uniforms. Obviously, not all sports clothing is a uniform, but it seems very odd to me that Category:American football uniforms -- which has uniforms in the category name! -- is not a descendant of Category:Uniforms. Does someone want to take on stitching this together (so to speak) in an appropriate manner? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nRelated to which, I am trying to work out how to categorize this very NSFW image (naked man in a body-painted replica of a Seattle Storm jersey) somewhere related to Category:Seattle Storm in a way that will not \"surprise\" someone with a definitely NSFW photo while looking up images of a sports team. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nMake Category:Sports uniforms a subcategory of both? Note that sports uniforms are also known as \"strip\" or \"kit\" in British English. --ghouston (talk)\n\nCurrently Category:Sports uniforms is a redirect to Category:Sports clothing, which seems wrong to me. Plenty of sports clothing is not a uniform. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nChanged that, put a few obvious categories (but not yet any individual photos) under Category:Sports uniforms. If anyone wants to help out, undoubtedly a lot more belongs under there. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nJuly 09\n\nWhen I was working on some FP-candidates I got a few questions about why I had uploaded the files in png. They are original scans in TIFF format at a high resolution. I wasn't able to find any proper guide for when to use lossless versus lossy files on commons, so I've created one. For many this is second nature, but I think enough people will find it useful so I'm posting my work in progress here. Please judge all you want and try to give me feedback. I'll do my best to adapt the guide and see what can be improved or if it should be merged somewhere else.\n\nNote: It is still lacking a number of sections that I wasn't able to just write of the top off my head. I'll be researching these and updating it.\n\nAvailable here: Commons:Lossless\n\n(I realize I should probably have a better name for is as well such as Commons:Lossy versus Lossless or something similar).\n\nBest, -- CFCF (talk)\n\nIn regards to \"Lossless files should not be used in articles such as on Wikipedia. If a file only exists in a lossless version a new lossy version should be uploaded and used.

Additionally it is better for the end user, and especially so when the end user has limited bandwidth capacity.\" - Tiffs thumbnail as jpegs so the bandwidth argument doesn't apply to them. You should not worry about processing power required generally speaking, we have servers so that they can be used (What takes more or less processing power isn't exactly straightforward either, I would recommend against doing anything because of processing power required, unless you are actually measuring the processing power or you are encountering some sort of limit like the large gif images don't thumbnail limit) [Obviously if you do notice something that's unambiguously exploding the servers, you shouldn't do it].
