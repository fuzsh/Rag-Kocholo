I've spend a considerable amount of time setting up a kettlebell page/gallery, making and uploading videos etc. some get deleted, sometimes I have no idea why. I understand everything is documented and I can read all info online. But the content is overwhelming to be honest, and the formatting doesn't really work for my brain either. So it would be great to get a more knowledgable contributor to help for 5 minutes or so. Someone who can say and ask:\n\n- it's better this way - can you change that - why did you do this - to get attribution you need to do so and so - etc\n\nI have a ton of content for what looks like is a very large but empty category, I'm willing to invest time and abide by the rules, but having things deleted and removed quite quickly makes me not want to do anything else. So, as above, my suggestion is an area where people can post the contributions they can make, then someone contacts them, and they work together for a bit. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Taco fleur (talk • contribs)\n\nHi,\n\nWe already have IRC and Commons:Help desk‎.

Or find it unhelpful? --bjh21 (talk)\n\n@Taco fleur: a word of advice about your userpage: please do not use it as a means of blatant self-promotion with content that is hardly relevant to the scope of Commons. I see that such conduct got your other account suspended from Wikipedia a while ago... --HyperGaruda (talk)\n\nno - they are not - please do not joke with the newbies. the editor is suggesting a teahouse. given the community's inability to fix broken processes, it becomes necessary to create a welcoming safe space to answer questions. you could adopt teahouse methods at help desk, but this community will not. and the user page critique is very amusing. maybe you should blank and admin lock? why waste time talking on his talk page? Slowking4 § Sander.v.Ginkel's revenge\n\nIs there an easy way to tag items in an image in Wikimedia Commons, that is placing one or more rectangles over the image in user-chosen places so that names of the items (e.g. the names of people) can pop up when end-users hover over them. If not, I say this could be useful. For example for pictures such as File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg or File:President Tsai poses for a photo with a delegation led by Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare (26 September 2017) in Taipei, Taiwan.jpg.

We can probably add some sort of {{Licensed-PD-Art|PD-old-100|CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0}} as a license but we would still have issues with metadata. Also many of the images I looked at are black and white low-resolution versions making them rather unappealing. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nIt's a shame that based on current contents, this is likely to be yet another aggregation site that fuels and supports blatant copyfraud.

Image is medium size and I think we could use it.\n\nSo maybe there are some images we could use but it would take time to search through it. Also there might be an issue with metadata database rights if we decide to do mass uploads.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nFor the sake of clarity, \"openculture.com\" is owned by a limited company, presumably to make money for somebody. The site relies on making money from advertising, so traffic generated from, say, links on Commons hosted images with openculture.com as the source would create a commercial income. On the \"donations\" page it is stated as \"Also note that we're not formally set up as a non-profit. So contributions aren't deductible at this time.\" It may or may not be their aim to run as a not for profit, but there is no system of governance, or guarantee, that this will be the case in the future.\n\nIt is a great pity that the WMF has no similar project to collate donations from GLAMs to Commons to the tune of 25m+ images. At least with the WMF doing this the licensing would be straight-forward and it would be run without advertising or making a potential profit for somebody. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI tried leaving a comment on that page about their use of intrusive pop-ups that are incessantly presented to visitors who use ad-blocking software.

For example, someone uploaded a PNG but named it as .SVG and so the system just stuck on the correct extension: File:NumberLineIntegers-white.svg.png. However these all need to be renamed as maintenance, but it creates a tremendous amount of work to constantly move these files. @Dispenser: has created a list that is updated monthly - User:Dispenser/Double extension, with some 8,000 files. They have to all be moved one by one apparently (as far as I know, there are not any reliable mass rename tools available even to file movers). There are filemovers and editors trying to fix as many as possible, but judging by the dates, additional files with double extensions are just being added every day.\n\nSome on the list flagged by Dispenser's script are not actually double extensions (ie File:A collection of engravings...midwifery Wellcome L0049598.jpg is listed because of the .mid extension), however, the majority are. There are many cases where people put in additional names/descriptions after the extension and the system adds another one, or they are being careless during group uploads and files end up with names like File:Holzheim - Neumarkt 012.jpg? Holzheim - Neumarkt 013.jpg. But surely the system could be modified to not allow users to upload or move files with double extensions, especially the ones that are very obviously duplicates, such as File:Innenraum.jpg.jpg. How can we get this fixed so upload rejects names like this? Pinging the dedicated @ShakespeareFan00: Thanks. — ʷiḳỉℳẚṅ₫¡₳ (talk)\n\nFor Upload Wizard ping @Matma Rex. — Speravir –\n\nSee COM:FR, renaming reason no. 6. Technically, your example is a PNG, so the last extension is right. As far as I know the magic number is checked and compared with the extension upon the uploading process. — Speravir –\n\nIt's not about wrong extensions but double extensions. A PNG named svg.png is a valid renaming criteria under maintenance, thus a tedious never-ending task. The system should recognize a double extension and return an error just as if a user tried to upload a file with an invalid character, such as / in the filename, or automatically fix it in the obvious cases ie filename.jpg.jpg. — ʷiḳỉℳẚṅ₫¡₳ (talk)\n\nThe system allows this because it is a valid page name. If you wish to disallow it, it can be done e.g. with title blacklist or with abuse filter. (@Speravir: I haven't touched UploadWizard since August and my last bigger contributions were in January [1].) Matma Rex (talk)\n\n@Matma Rex: I pinged you because I thought you were the main developer. Is this actually wrong? — Speravir –\n\n@Speravir: I used to work on UploadWizard, but now I mostly spend my time on VisualEditor and other page editing stuff. For UploadWizard problems, I recommend these guys: wmf:Staff and contractors#Multimedia (although Mark is on vacation right now). (And also, sending emails is better than on-wiki pings, not everyone has notifications enabled or checks the wikis daily – but WMF staff definitely check their WMF email every day.) Matma Rex (talk)\n\nHi I want to know why you delete the image of Erandi Bermudez doesnot have a copyright we personally took it from him, Wait for you response — Preceding unsigned comment added by Maikdp (talk • contribs)\n\nI presume the deletion you're referring to is Commons:Deletion requests/File:Erandi Bermudez.jpg. Based on that, it seems that the picture was deleted because it was available elsewhere on the Internet without a free licence before it was uploaded to Commons. In these cases, Commons requires explicit permission from the copyright holder by some other route. One approach is to arrange for other sites to display it with the correct licensing details.

Slowking4 § Sander.v.Ginkel's revenge\n\nIs there any online tool where I can submit a collection of links in order to find a certain type of images? For example if I submit the links to the images missing categories, the tool will identify drawings, paintings, trees, fruits, animals, roots etc. Or to find a specific type of images, for example drawings - which should't be hard at all to do: the majority of drawings are drawn in dark ink on white backgrounds. That would help a lot the categorization of images. -- Fructibus (talk)\n\nIts not a free service (although there is a free demo), and its concentrating on photos I think not drawing, but https://cloud.google.com/vision/ comes to mind.

I have a upload there that renders correctly. Your file doesn't have a XML declaration, that is where your character encoding is supposed to be declared. So at this point without having that the renderer doesn't know what character encoding you're using. When you have problems with SVG rendering, first thing to do is to run the file through W3C Validator, that'll give you any pointers on if anything is wrong with the file which can end up leading to rendering issues. The SVG renderer does have its issues, but in this instance it was a problem with the SVG file. - Offnfopt(talk)\n\nMany thanks, Offnfopt.

There are too many and they look bad stacked on each other displaying the same data. A simple modification can allow them to be merged and people will just have remember one template to add. Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) (talk)\n\nRichard, I think that in the long run we should have several templates that add standard Wikidata-based info for categories. Eventually it should be probably done in Lua but for now I cobbled together:\n\ntemplate:Wikidata person for people categories\n\ntemplate:Wikidata place for geographical locations\n\ntemplate:Wikidata taxon for taxons\n\nAt the moment it is a single template that calls several other templates, but eventually they should be unified to provide more coherent look. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI don't see why they cannot be merged since \"instance of\" at Wikidata will tell in \"human\" or a location, or a taxon. Also not all biographical entries are creators (writers, artists, photographers), we will have to differentiate that somehow. Template:Authority control and Template:Wikidata can certainly be merged if Template:Authority control would display the Wikidata Q-number. Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) (talk)\n\nThey can be merged but someone would have to write code to do it. Also they do have rather different content so it did not seem necessary. As for creator templates: we do create personalized creator templates for creators (writers, artists, photographers) and place them in \"Creator\" namespace. But we could also just call {{Creator|Wikidata=Q????}} to display the person infobox in category namespace. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nDone the default template is \"Authority_control\" and it now displays the Q-number alongside the Wikidata symbol, See Category:Wayne Lyman Morse for an example. Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) (talk)\n\nJust saw this on the news. I couldn't have made this shit up! In its guise as the omniscient omnipotent watcher of all, Facebook is \"asking users to send in their own nude photos.\" Their sacred AI angels will then track down \"revenge porn\" of the users wherever it appears. It may also inadvertently grow a conscience, collaborate with online trolls and anti-Semites, and decide to release its entire luscious archives to Wikileaks and Encyclopedia Dramatica, at which point all good and decent people on the Internet will take unadulterated lasting glee in humiliating the people who were dumb enough to participate in this scheme. But I digress.\n\nThe main point here is that unfortunately Commons could be facing a redefinition of \"personally identifiable photos\" from the Top Down, where what is willed must be. Facebook is coy about its divine powers but I assume that to match their matchless facial recognition they now do nipple recognition, ass recognition, and like the Porky's phys-ed teacher, they never forget an incriminating mole. So, now what? Wnt (talk)\n\nPlease avoid posting in this style. The Village Pump is not the scramble seen at Jimmy Wales' Wikipedia talk page, where contributors are itching to throw around the f-word or c-word just to \"prove\" how much they love free speech, nor is it twitter to post passing reactions. I would rather not have fucking and shit pop up in my watchlist as a way to grab attention. If anything, using these words just means that I'm not interested in engaging with the point you were making, as the thread appears to inappropriately childish or trolling. Thanks --Fæ (talk)\n\nI tend to get animated when thrown a ticking grenade. Anyway, I've told you about the story, so my job here may be done ... I'll hand this one off to you now. Wnt (talk)\n\n(1) I don't see what this has to do with commons, (2) desperate times call for desperate measures. If you know someone is actively trying to spread a particular image of you, registering that image so image recognition can automatically remove such content has some validity. While one would prefer not to have to register such a image with a online service, it could be a better alternative than having your image spammed all across that service. - Offnfopt(talk)\n\nWell, the first problem Commons has is what if someone uploaded an image of an anonymous body part for anatomical demonstrations, someone reposts it on Facebook, and their software flags it -- correctly or not, who knows? -- as a \"revenge porn\" image and tells the person who uploaded their picture, who now are coming saying we have something they didn't know about?\n\nSecond, what if someone claims all that but is lying?\n\nThird, what about when Facebook starts saying \"Look, all anyone needs to do to stop revenge porn is install our software, sign our Terms and agree to liability and no reverse engineering and so forth, and then the AI will magically make it go away\" and Congress says that's a great idea and Commons ought to be forced to join into it?\n\nFourth, when Facebook starts selling the AI profiles they compiled from \"volunteers\" to recognize anonymous body parts as fairly short strings of digits, so that businesses can monitor whether any of their employees are damaging their image by posting self-porn (making them register to assist, of course), and they come after subjects for Commons articles.\n\nI mean let's be clear, they're holding all the cards here and they're going to be dealing them at us for quite some time. Wnt (talk)\n\nI don't think this system is based on image recognition. Some sites mention the recording of image hashes, which is likely a sort of perceptual hashing similar to en:PhotoDNA. --ghouston (talk)\n\nImage recognition is a broad subject, there are a lot of different methods it isn't just about trying to identify / recognize objects in a photo. A lot of times you don't even care to identify what is in the image, you just want to compare to other images. For instance a lot of reverse image searches use a images histogram for image recognition by comparing it to other images histograms. - Offnfopt(talk)\n\nYes, in this case it would be designed to find matching instances of the same photo, even if they were somewhat modified, but wouldn't match different photos of the same subject. --ghouston (talk)\n\nNovember 09\n\nI've noticed that Commons appears to be currently experiencing a large lag with Category propagation. Anyone else seeing this? —RP88 (talk)\n\nPossibly related, the Commons job queue has ~5.6 million entries (see [5]). —RP88 (talk)\n\n@RP88: Yes. This appears to be why Category:Images from the Geograph British Isles project still has 1,653,715 files in it after 16 days. — Jeff G. ツ\n\nI wonder if it has something to do with 5M transclusions of Module:Wikidata label, which I was just fixing per phabricator:T173194. But maybe it is a coincidence. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nPerhaps... but if Jeff's > 16 day estimate above is accurate, the timing doesn't work out since your first attempt at a fix for T173194 was 10 days ago. Given that the Commons job queue has actually grown to ~5.8 million entries, rather than decreased, something else must also be involved since even if your edit was the trigger I\"d expect the queue to shrink as the jobs were processed. —RP88 (talk)\n\nNot neccesarily. Jobs aren't added all in one go. Many jobs are sort of \"meta\" jobs that get split into smaller jobs. So as a big job is processed the things in the job queue will go up because more jobs are added as part of the processing step. Bawolff (talk)\n\nThe lag with Categories appears to be ongoing and the Commons job queue has ~6.1 million entries, —RP88 (talk)\n\nThe job queue in now a much more reasonable ~0.5 million. However, while Category:Images from the Geograph British Isles project was slowly draining for a while the rate of decrease has nearly stopped; the category still is extremely lagged with 1,397,118 files in it. —RP88 (talk)\n\nOctober 24\n\n@SandraF (WMF): What is the diference between Structured Commons and Wikidata? -- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nTuválkin Structured Commons is going to be Wikidata like storage for data stored currently on file description pages. Instead of text with information about author, date, license, etc. You will have properties of file items. Hopefully the output to the users will not change much, but the underlying storage will. Structured Commons will reside on Commons, instead of Wikidata site.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nHello Tuvalkin: what Jarekt says, indeed. Just one thing to make clear: with Structured Commons, structured data will be added as an addition to file pages on Wikimedia Commons. This is done by using the software Wikibase, the software that is also used for Wikidata. And you will be able to use Wikidata items and properties to describe files on Commons. This is integrated in Wikimedia Commons itself. I'd be interested to hear if the Frequently Asked Questions about Structured Commons make things clear, or if there should be more clarification. SandraF (WMF) (talk)\n\nThanks for the replies, @SandraF (WMF): and @Jarekt: . You seem to have replied about what Structured Commons is, not so much how it is supposed to integrate with Wikidata. A few PgUps from here we have a war going on about Wikidata siphoning off (and removing from) Commons hardcoded data contributed through volonteer work and disappeared into an opaque database. I cannot guess if having our own in-house Wikidata will improve that kind of thing or make it even worse. Back when Structured Commons was first ventilated, I saw it as a way to finally achieve true internationality in this project, by allowing categories to have names in more than one language, instead of being hardcoded into English. That seems to have never taken of, and all we have now is a hyped-up, over-funded GIGO machine. -- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nIt should be very possible to create translated names for categories, if the Structured Data plan includes data pages for Categories, as well as data pages for files. Data pages for categories would also be very useful for describing in a structured way what the categories contain. @SandraF (WMF): Can you confirm that data pages for Categories are in the plan, ideally to be implemented as soon as possible? Jheald (talk)\n\nNo, data pages for categories are not in the plan. What is in the plan, is to 1) leave the category system intact as it is and 2) in addition, make sure that the information contained in categories (to which I also contributed quite a bit in my free time, long before being hired by WMF, so I definitely want that work to be useful ad infinitum!) can *also* be transferred to structured metadata, which will be fully multilingual, machine-readable, and fully integrated in the APIs. We also work on search functionality that makes sure that you will be able to find media via that way, in your own language. I'm preparing a FAQ question and answer with more clarification. SandraF (WMF) (talk)\n\n@SandraF (WMF): Well that is bloody silly. How do we go about changing the plan?\n\nIt would be very very easy to have data pages for categories -- essentially no extra work at all. Why is this not being done? Is it simply that the developers hate categories and want to see them die? If that is the case, they're being naive.\n\nCategories and structured data are likely to continue side-by-side for many years to come. So why will the CommonsData project not make this small step to add huge value to the category system?\n\nData pages for categories would make it easy to store the information to:\n\ninternationalise category names\n\nrecord in a Wikidata-item based way what the category represents (eg, for intersection categories)\n\nrecord other valuable properties about the categories -- eg sort orders that make sense.\n\nThis would be extraordinarily easy to add, just by making it so that there is a data page attached to each category page. It will hugely help the gathering of information from categories, without which Structured Data's precious all-singing all-dancing multilingual search will be utterly utterly useless, because it will contain no information to drive it.\n\nSo why not do this one simple basic extraordinarily useful thing? Jheald (talk)\n\nJheald, My understanding is that we first focus on file namespace as that is the main product of Commons. Categories are important, but if I have to choose where to put our resources I would vote on Files first. If you would like to work on adding Wikidata info to categories you can do it already using Wikidata as great many are linked. By the way, I like CommonsData you mentioned, much better than Structured Data as the name of the project. --Jarekt (talk)\n\n@Jarekt: It's a reasonable point, but I don't agree -- for two main reasons. Firstly, because the heavy development stuff required -- eg Federation, Multi-Content Revisions -- is now already done. Applying it to category-pages in addition to file-pages is a comparatively small addition. I don't believe it would significantly hold up the roll out of CommonsData for file pages, so I believe it's a false choice to see a competition for resources between the two. Secondly, perhaps even more importantly, I believe it will be far easier to make sure that CommonsData can support two different sorts of pages before it goes into its initial production release here, rather than to try to retro-fit that when there is a substantially populated live database already up and running, that each and every slightest data-structure change would require re-initialising. Much better to spend a couple of weeks now to make sure this is possible, rather than far more effort and difficulty later. (Or just to be dismissed out-of-hand later it's not possible, it's not what was designed, and the developers have moved on). If this is something that we think is going to be useful (and my view is that it is something that could turn out to be very useful), the time to insist on it is now.\n\nOn your second point, according to the numbers from September only 26.8% of categories on Commons can be identified to an item on Wikidata. For 73.2% there is currently no identifiable Wikidata item -- neither an article-type item, nor a category-type item. Many of these (but how many I don't know) are the famous \"intersection categories\", for which Wikidata does not wish to have any item. Yet these are exactly the categories that it would be most useful to have a machine-interpretable description of, eg via category combines topics (P971). In my opinion, (a) identifying and machine-describing this 73.2% of Commons categories is essential for acquiring the information that we will need to put into the CommonsData pages for files, that is required if Sandra's search is to have enough information to work; and (b) the obvious place to store such machine-descriptions of categories is on a CommonsData page associated with the category, that automatically comes into being when the category comes into being, automatically follows the category if the category is renamed, doesn't require a connection to be maintained with a Wikidata item, and is owned and editable directly as an integral part of Commons. Jheald (talk)\n\nWikidata Notability will also prevent the conversion of a lot of categories into Wikidata items. It's easy to create a category for a random building, device, or sports person, but harder to find \"serious and publicly available references\" when they don't have Wikipedia articles. --ghouston (talk)\n\nAnother problem with this design (as I understand it) is that there will be duplication between the categories and data properties. It's unlikely that software will be able to keep them perfectly synchronized when people add or remove entries from one place or the other. --ghouston (talk)\n\n@Ghouston: I'm not sure which design you're referring to as \"this design\" in the last sentence that would cause problems. But having machine descriptions of categories would at least give us a chance to harvest data from them to put into the data pages for files (perhaps marked as provisional and needing manual confirmation). It may not be brilliant, but at the moment it is the best metadata we have as to what files relate to. Jheald (talk)\n\n--ghouston actually the notability policy of wikidata accept also that the item should have a structured role. We still could debate again if the structured data of commons fulfill such need exactly like a category author of wikinews or author item on wikisource. This is far from being really \"structured\" in the general vision of the community, IMHO. d:Wikidata:Project_chat#Other_sites_section_in_items\n\nalso, find \"serious and publicly available references\" is quite simple. Almost all countries have database for \"everything\". Even if they are scattered sometimes. The main problem I see is the geographical gap. it is much easier to find an ID for something in a continent and not in another, but not the lack of references per se. I can create 10000 structured item with enough IDs of scientists, all could have their image and their category on commons one day, and this would be easy in the end. Similarly, France has a very accurate database of sites of public interest and almost all German PhD students have an ID for their doctoral Thesis, Open Street Map has millions of information about \"nodes\" that are places, and so on. So in many cases associating IDs and structured information is not the most complicated step, it requires just a little bit of literacy. Integrating this in the workflow of avarage users with content-related need it is possible, I did many times with wikidata aspects for example. If you manage to tone down that snobby attitude of the \"expert user\" that has to be there to \"teach you stuff\" because \"newbies are so delicate\" (or whatever), and you find something that people really feel useful (improving gallery in a semiautomated way, expanding the multilanguage level, finding links to external databases, creating to-do lists) than it can work quite well.--Alexmar983 (talk)\n\nYes, in some cases it won't be too hard, it depends on the type of item and the geographical location. I'm not denying the potential benefits of structured data if it's implemented well. --ghouston (talk)\n\nIt is true that a strict reading of d:WD:N currently has that requirement. However, the underlying purpose of clause 2 is that an item should reflect a \"clearly identifiable conceptual or material entity\". A building that has a Commons category is very evidently a \"a clearly identifiable material entity\" -- regardless of whether we can find sources describing when the building was built or who has lived in it, etc, or an entry in an official record, or an identifier in a database. The Wikidata item is appropriate and needed to record verifiable information such as which town the building is in, and what its coordinates are. I would suggest that the real intention is to keep out items for \"intersection categories\", that are not considered clearly identifiable primary concepts.\n\nIt would probably be useful to suggest an update to d:WD:N, to reflect revised consensus that (i) Commons category <-> article-type item links are acceptable, removing the reference to the 2013 RfC (which IMO should be marked historical and superseded; and (ii) that it is acceptable for the only sitelink to be a Commons category -- so long as the category relates to an identifiable primary entity, not an \"intersection\".\n\nBut regardless of the above, that will leave a lot of categories that are intersection categories, that will not have a Wikidata item, that machine descriptions would be really useful to have stored for -- that it would be useful to have a CommonsData page for as a place to store those descriptions. Jheald (talk)\n\nA couple of further points. In terms of the roadmap, it may well make very good sense to roll out CommonsData pages for categories before any Commons data pages for files. It would allow the impacts of the big heavy technical changes like Federation and Multi-Content revisions, and also the implementation of WDQS on Commons, to be tested for real and at scale in a much easier to implement environment than the File pages. I say \"easier to implement\" for a couple of reasons. Firstly the ontology is much easier -- simply with multilingual labels and with P971 \"category combines topics\" one could already do a lot of useful work. In contrast the ontology for file pages is going to be difficult -- how to represent significant contributors to a page; what different \"types\" of images should be identified; how to use \"depicts\" and \"main subject\" for images -- for files, all of this is going to need considerable negotiation, because it's really important to do some hard thinking about this before the data gets populated. Whereas for categories, we could basically be good to go now. Secondly the page design is much easier -- the information on CommonsData pages for files is going to be very much aimed at end users, and it's a big design challenge to think how one might present it, how one might integrate it with existing template-based presentation. It will require major design thought, followed by a major re-write of how the file presentation looks. In contrast, the integration of CommonsData pages for categories could be much more simple, direct, and rough-and-ready -- eg a very Wikidata-style section that was expandable/collapsible just above the category contents would be quite adequate. As information really only aimed at what User:SandraF (WMF) classifies as editors / curators, and then only those with a particular interest in this area, it doesn't need to look great, and indeed perhaps the expandable section might not be shown at all unless users had selected a particular CSS switch, eg by enabling a \"beta feature\", so most users wouldn't see it or be bothered by it at all. So that's why I think in terms of user experience (UX) work, CommonsData for categories could be implemented with really minimal work -- yet would provide a really useful target, rather than only being able to go straight to file pages, for evaluating and refining things like Federation and Multi-Content Revisions in the wild and at scale; and for adapting things like QuickStatements and WDQS to the Commons setting. Jheald (talk)\n\nHi, I think Jheald has a point. Moreover, from the discussion we had in Wikimania in Montreal, I understood that categories will be moved to CommonsData first. Has this changed? Regards, Yann (talk)\n\nHello! I'm sorry about the distress this is causing :| ... I checked this with the team, with the argument that some community members really want us to work on a new item in the roadmap first, namely data pages for categories. I did not hear a clear no, but there is very, very big reluctance to work on this. What I hear as feedback is:\n\nProperly implementing this is more time-consuming than you think; making these properly editable is a larger engineering challenge than it seems at first sight, and it would also need to be integrated into APIs. Putting work in this, takes away effort from other things, and we already have quite limited time...\n\nWith that limited time, we want to focus design and development energy on doing the core part - structured data on files - correctly.\n\nPlease understand that we take into consideration that categories converted to Wikibase, with very different Wikidata-like workflows associated with that, might be something that, even when hidden and in beta, might equally confuse and upset many community members ;-|\n\nA few more thoughts:\n\nPerhaps one can indeed work with the intersected categories on Wikidata a la Russian artists (which I personally would not dedicate my volunteer time towards, see my next point).\n\nFrom my own first encounters with categories in Wikimedia projects in the mid-2000s (?) I already found them a very imperfect way to tag the content we hold and improve its findability. They are the best organization tool we have at the moment, and I create and maintain them too. But frankly, structured data is so much better to describe media files properly here. Putting my volunteer hat on, I'd prefer to immediately dive into the inevitable, hard and complicated work on the data model for the files themselves, rather than first spending a lot of time on an in-between task (and knowing that the hard modelling work does not go away, right).\n\nAn approach that I think would lead to good results without category data items too: it is probably quite doable to develop small gamelike tools (a la Wikidata games) that would allow us to translate intersection categories to multiple structured data statements at a pretty quick tempo. I'm always amazed at how fast certain conversions and other mass edit tasks can happen with the help of focused community tools. I'm not a tool builder myself, but I definitely want to help think about good ways how to prepare for that.\n\nThanks, SandraF (WMF) (talk)\n\n@SandraF (WMF): Thanks for getting back on this issue. I have taken time to think about the points you make above. It is understandable that a project is likely to be initially resistant to external input. But after reflection, in the cold light of day, I do not think the arguments above stand up. In detail:\n\nTime: the Structured Data project is going to take years. In the overall scheme of things a couple of weeks to make this possible is a drop in the ocean. And it's not as if it's going to need all the team's attention to make it possible. Yes, I appreciate that the project may already be running late, and that the delivery dates promised to funders appear very tough (probably impossible) to fulfill. But that doesn't make it a good idea to throw things out of the roadmap, if now is the sensible time to think about them and implement them.\n\nUser Interface: The project has already shown it's possible to present Wikitext content and editable Wikibase content together on the same page, as shown in the previous prototype page to this current one, featuring the lighthouse picture. Editing such Wikibase content is mature technology -- Wikidata has been live for five years now. All that is required is to create a page viewer that can slap the Wikibase editing area as a expandable/collapsible area in the middle of a category page, and then make that page viewer available either as an alternative skin or as an opt-in beta feature. It doesn't have to be beautiful or cute, it just has to be usable. Most information going into CommonsData category pages would be going in through QuickStatements or similar bulk or bot tools; most information coming out of the pages would be coming out in the form of query results from WDQS, or templates in the category wiki sections. The UI just needs to make it possible for those that want to to be able to manually check and edit the Wikibase content. But most users of the page will be able to do all normal business with the page, just as now, without ever being aware of it, and without presentation of the Wikibase section ever being enabled.\n\nAPI. Yes, this does need some consideration, to make sure that the CommonsData wikibase can support category-page items tied directly to category pages, as well as media items tied directly to media pages. The data structure needs to be able to accommodate that, and calls need to be specified for how it is accessed. There may also be some wrinkles, such as: if a category page happens to be linked to both a local CommonsData item and a Wikidata item, how should templates specify which one should be preferred to access a property statement from. I suspect most of this will turn out to be minor tweaks of minor details, because for CommonsData category pages almost all of this should turn out to be a fairly straightforward implementation of a wikibase installation, with almost all of the API lifting already done in the shape of the exisiting wikibase specs. But making sure that the APIs have the flexibility to support CommonsData pages for categories is absolutely something that ought to be done now, because as a rule it's easy enough to do that thinking about an API before it goes into full volume production use, but a nightmare to adapt an API when it's been deployed into live high-volume mission-critical use. My worry would be that unless at least some thinking gets put in now to make sure the API will be reasonably easily able to support CommonsData category pages then \"Not now\" will de facto become \"Not ever\", and that is not acceptable.\n\nThe other point on this is that investing time now to support CommonsData category pages may well save time down the line (as suggested above), by decoupling the roll-out of Multi-Content revisions, Federation, CommonsData QuickStatements, and use of CommonsData data in WDQS from dependence on the file pages, in particular the significant challenges of the file page UI and the ontology issues of what statements we want to see on them. It won't hurt or hinder work in these areas, but it means that they won't be blockers either -- decoupling the two means that it should be possible to test the technologies above at scale in a live production environment earlier, and uncover and address unexpected issues sooner, than would be possible if all that had to wait for finalisation of all the issues around file pages to have to be resolved first. (A couple of asides. 1. I note that implementation and testing of WDQS seemingly doesn't appear to currently feature on the roadmap at all. It should -- it's vital. 2. Even the simplest thing that is proposed as the pilot property for media -- a multilingual caption -- is still has issues to consider: for example, should such captions be allowed to contain wikilinks, or formatting (eg italicisation, math markup) ? For simplicity and portability, I'm guessing probably not. But it also means they're likely to be less contextualised and end-user useful than descriptions we can currently show.) CommonsData category pages don't have these ontology issues to be resolved, and their UI doesn't need to be as polished; so it should be possible to get them up and running earlier, and get working on any issues that turn up with the technology sooner, than if we are blocked to have to wait until augmented file pages are ready to roll out.\n\nCommonsData would scare Commons users (?). This seems rather a desperate argument, and also seems to misunderstand what is being suggested. Categories would not be \"converted\" to wikibase. Categories would continue exactly as they are at the moment, with exactly the same look and exactly the same workflow. But they would gain an attached CommonsData page, visible to those who chose to make it visible, where information about the category can be recorded -- information with all the advantages of wikibase: easy addition, using tools like QuickStatements, and easy queryability, using WDQS. Having an attached data page makes so many things so much easier and so much more accessible than eg having to rely on template parameters embedded in the wikitext of the main page. But the impact on ordinary category use for somebody that didn't have the data-viewer enabled would be nil. Such information might be e.g. a machine-description of the contents that the category is for; or an internationalisation of the name of the category, that a user-widget might e.g. use to show as a localised subtitle below the category name. Currently we have all sorts of information templates that sit on the top of categories (categories which do not all necessarily have links to wikidata) -- eg for coordinates, book numbers, heritage numbers, etc. A data page is a much better place for this kind of information to be (if the maintainers of the template are happy to put it there) -- it makes it much easier to access and review at scale, eg to identify what's there and what's missing, or what seems plausible and what seems dubious, and eg to compare against external resources. Perhaps the most important thing about CommonsData for categories is that it would be a recognition from the Structured Data project that category pages are seen as front-line fully first-class pages on Commons (putting to rest dark suspicions that have been voiced by a number of Commons editors), and a vote of confidence in their future. Making it easy to store data associated with a category page should open up all sorts of possibilities for templates and gadgets to make them a richer experience. If we have the possibility of enabling that now with a comparatively simple step, we should make sure to do so.\n\nRussian artists may not be the best example of intersection category to have in mind, though it does show how contents can be machine-described using existing properties and items. Instead, consider that we have huge numbers of media-rich sub-categories, where only the parent category qualifies for a Wikidata item. I am thinking of categories like \"Interior of Church X\" or \"Church X (stained glass)\" -- see eg all the categories listed at Category:Stained glass windows in Hampshire or Category:Interiors of churches in Essex -- or the perennial \"Topic Y in art\" in the huge tree of categories under Category:Art by subject -- or any number of other families of examples where it is an intersection sub-category that contains most of the media.\n\nBy identifying families of categories of these kinds, it should be possible to machine-add machine-descriptions for such categories at a rate of hundreds or thousands at a time. Then, when we come to adding topic-tags for the structured data project, that should make it possible to directly machine-add corresponding topic tags (with their appropriate Wikidata identifiers) at a rate of tens of hundreds or tens of thousands at a time. Yes, GLAMs have shown that \"what can you see in this picture\" tagging games can generate a lot of tags. But experience with big collections such as Art UK or the British Library \"mechanical curator\" set show they do have their limitations, particularly when there are a lot of files to cover (and we have a lot of files). Also, it's hard to see just a tagging game identify the particular church that eg the images in Category:St Peter and Paul's church, Thruxton, Hampshire (stained glass) come from. So (IMO) it's critical to extract what we can from the data we have, and the more automatically or machine-assistedly we can do it the better.\n\nHaving CommonsData pages gives us somewhere we can start systematically putting these descriptions, letting us work together efficiently as a team, because we can see what anybody else has done; and use eg WDQS to identify further families of categories containing a lot of media, as yet without descriptions or linked Wikidata items. So it means that those that want to can get on with this as soon as those CommonsData pages become available, and see how much of the ground we can get covered by the time the CommonsData pages for files become available and it becomes possible to start writing topic-tags to the CommonsData file pages. (At which point the CommonsData category pages will also be a useful place to be able to record when the category has most recently been swept, and its files appropriately topic-tagged. Being able to easily record, and then to retrieve at scale with WDQS, this kind of auxiliary data is the kind of thing that attached wikibase data pages will really facilitate.) It's also a useful thing to do, to identify systematically and early as wide a range as possible of the different relationships that intersection categories currently combine, to identify the range of combinations of properties that the structured data system will need to be able to represent and access, if it is to be able to match what we can currently do.\n\nCould we just use some kind of game tool for the category-processing above? -- eg randomly select a category with media and without a Wikidata item, get the user to identify the proper coding in terms of properties recognised by the topic-search system and appropriate Wikidata Q-numbers, getting them to confirm, Cat-a-lot style, which media in the category the tagging was appropriate for, then mark the category as 'done' in a private database belonging to the tool? Perhaps -- although I still believe it would be nice to try automate as much of that as possible.\n\nBut I think something very like a \"category view\" is likely to survive for a very long time, (i) to allow users to discover, in a browse-through way \"what other images exist, that have some particular thing(s) in common with this\"; (ii) to act as a landing page, from corresponding Wikipedia pages; (iii) to give a space where groups of images that have some thing(s) in common to be annotated with more information about the thing they have in common; (iv) to deliver all of the above in a hand-editable, hand-customisable way; including grouping the files to a manageable number, or ordering them in particular ways. I have no doubt that we will be able to improve on what we have at the moment (eg with gadgets that use some of the structured data to adjust category views, eg sorting by date created, or date depicted); and also that some of the above may be achieved by \"virtual views\" generated on-the-fly by the topic-search/refine application.\n\nBut I suspect that the existing categories with their hand-crafted content will continue to persist in parallel with that for a very long time to come; so I think the point remains, that it would be an utterly ill-conceived short-sighted false economy, if the opportunity was not taken now to safeguard the ability to have CommonsData pages associated with categories, just in order to save a couple of weeks of developer time. Now is the time that this will be decided, and I think it is something the Commons community should insist on. Jheald (talk)\n\n(Discussion continuing by email). Jheald (talk)\n\nHave we got any category for this?

Those are issues with mapping between Commons categories and Wikipedia articles, like links to non-existing categories or links to multiple categories. Those links are critical for people coming from Wikipedias to land in correct categories. The links should be only between \"exact\" matches. I would appreciate is more people familiar with Commons category system could help, as correcting the issues often involve creating new categories or chasing down categories that were moved without redirects. If we could, bring down the backlog than it would be easier to correct new problems as they pop-up. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nWhen WSC is over, I might help.--Alexmar983 (talk)\n\nNovember 04\n\nThe Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum recently completed a huge digitization project and now has 92% of the museum's collection available online (over 200,000 objects). For any objects with expired copyrights, they let you download the high-resolution image directly from their website (with no fees). Although the majority of the collection is still under copyright, there are thousands of high-quality images there that are public domain and available to transfer to Commons. Anyone interested in working on this? Kaldari (talk)\n\nYes. --Fæ (talk)\n\n@Fæ: Yay! Unfortunately, I haven't figured out any way to filter their collection by copyright status or year created, but there is https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/periods/. They have also published all of their metadata on GitHub under a CC0 license (with documentation even), which is pretty awesome! Kaldari (talk)\n\nIt's doable, perhaps just not being over reliant on their options. Objects seem to be either NCK or mention fair use. It's the type of collection that I would rather do a test set and take an agile approach. I suspect that copyright filtering will reduce the total significantly. Anyway, thankfully there is an API, so I'll investigate that to enable a smarter batch upload, rather than rely on scraping. By the way, their documentation shows lots of humour, that may or may not help considering I'm in the more reserved British headspace.\n\n... The API is working nicely, so getting information like the largest image size is not an issue and dates appear in various ways which means some metadata mapping effort. Before running an upload I probably need to spend a bit of time working out some fallbacks on the data, probably do a little state machine to choose the best license even though has_no_known_copyright will be the default, and decide if there's mileage in forcing default Commons categories based on collection or donor. I'll make a project page when ready to lay out these choices. A few days time I'd guess. --Fæ (talk)\n\nProject page at User:Fæ/Project list/Cooper-Hewitt.

Does anyone know?\n\nSincerely, NeoMeesje (talk)\n\nThat depends whether they are in scope. If a notable person, of which we have a Wikipedia article, sends us a selfie to illustrate the article, that could be great. Also active contributors to Wikimedia/Wikipedia are generally allowed to upload a small number of personal pictures. Jcb (talk)\n\nThe person on a selfie may be in 30 years important, we don't knew this. Why delete? If the license is correct, it's in scope. --Ralf Roleček\n\nThat's an excessively generous interpretation of \"realistically useful\". There are about 7,000,000,000 people in the world, and about 5,000,000 articles on English Wikipedia. Thus (with a rather large margin of error) about one person in 1,000 is interesting enough that we might care about their photo. A 1 in 1000 chance of being useful is not \"realistically useful\", and for that 0.1% there's always COM:UNDEL. --bjh21 (talk)\n\nAfter a thorough reading of COM:SCOPE I found nothing about saving photos for potential hypothetical use in 30 years. Active contributors can upload a small amount of person photos ideally for use on their user page. Full Stop. We are not a Social Media site. -- Sixflashphoto (talk)\n\nIf somebody is keen to keep a particular selfie, they may be able to add it to a category like \"men wearing brown shirts and green baseball caps backwards\". Perhaps that would put it in scope. Scope bothers me a bit, because if random selfies are not in scope, then are photos of random buildings, aircraft or other species of animals also out of scope? Most buildings aren't notable, most species of large animals are already well covered in Commons, and one 747 looks much like another. --ghouston (talk)\n\nCommons is the base of free media, not the base of wikipedia. There are more projects than wikipedia in the world of wikimedia and also the files here are for all projects online and offline. The interpretation of com:scope is outdated. --Ralf Roleček\n\nFurther to the above, we need to be able to illustrate articles like en:Selfie.\n\nIf a photo of someone taking a selfie is necessary for illustrating an article or some other reasonable rational outside Wikipedia, we have plenty of photos of people taking selfies for those reasons that are here. We shouldn't delete every picture of a person who isn't \"notable\", active contributors should have the right to upload a small number of pictures of themselves, but we shouldn't become a depository for selfies of yourself, or vacation photos or the like. If you need a place to put them online that's what instagram is for. IMO there is no reason to change a policy that doesn't seem to be hurting or bothering anyone other than the uploader. -- Sixflashphoto (talk)\n\n@ghouston: Whether a category of \"men wearing brown shirts and green baseball caps backwards\" will save your selfie depends on whether such a category is educationally useful. If it's the uniform of a political movement, or common dress in a particular region, then maybe it will (until we have enough pictures in that category). I don't think the scope applies any differently to buildings, aircraft, or animals: we don't need a photo of every house, or every horse, or every airliner in the world, any more than we need a photo of every person. We do need enough to show all the significant variations, though. --bjh21 (talk)\n\nNovember 13\n\nHi. I know that we have NoUploads template and categories of files that should be undeleted when the work will be in the public domain. However, I think that it would be useful to create a template which would say something likeː \"This author died in X year. His/her (or their) works will enter public domain in X year\" and add the template to authors which have their own categories. The URAA also should be mentioned where applicable, such as \"This author died in 1945 and his works are in the public domain in X (his home country) but please do not upload his works to Commons unless 95 years has passed since the work publication date because of the URAA\". I'm not sure if it's possible though. Any thoughts?--Дима Г (talk)\n\n19:19, 13 November 2017 (UTC)\n\nCan somebody, please, at last react on Commons:OTRS/Noticeboard#Check_for_letters.2C_please? No one pays attention there, and files get deleted failing to receive an approval from OTRS volunteer for already 3 months. --TohaomgTohaomg (talk)\n\nNovember 14\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: --Offnfopt(talk)\n\nFile:Hijiri88's postcard from Wikimedia Taiwan.jpg was uploaded by me for the sole purpose of transclusion on my English Wikipedia user page, and I don't why it was transferred to Commons. I am not comfortable with my username appearing in a Commons file name, and if outright deletion from Commons is not an option, I would like (a) an explanation why, and (b) the file name to be changed. Hijiri88 (talk)\n\nBy the way, please don't tell me that this is the wrong place for my request. I am already 90% certain of that being the case.\n\nThing is, I should not have to familiarize myself with the norms for Commons just because I engaged in activity on a separate Wikimedia project and someone else, without my consent, dragged me here. I'm not a regular Commons contributor and have no immediate intention of becoming one, so trying to independently familiarize myself with Commons processes rather than simply asking at the Village Pump (what this is) would be pointless.\n\nHijiri88 (talk)\n\nConcerning why it was transferred you can asked @Fastily: who transferred it. Concerning deletion, I do not see any problem, but I would just wait for some time (say a day) to see whether there are any motivated objections.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nCorrecting ping: @Fastily: --Ymblanter (talk)\n\nEvery free file should be on Commons, not on some local Wikipedia, that's why it was transferred, just like many other files. This probably covers your concerns. Multichill (talk)\n\n@Multichill: It's not a free file. I don't know if you know how to retrieve the file's original en.wiki history (I don't), but if I recall correctly: I wanted to use it on my en.wiki user page and the original upload said I wasn't sure about licensing but that I wanted to authorise myself to use it on my userpage. I was then coerced by a bot to give it a \"proper licensing template\", and in utter confusion I picked the first one I could find. But the image actually contained a tiny amount of \"non-free content\" that I was then asked to remove by another user who also changed the template by themselves, and when the image was ported over to Commons it was done so carelessly that the Commons version was the one that included the non-free content that I had been asked to remove, and this led to my user page also transcluding that version that I had already painstakingly edited. Had I known any of this would happen I would have likely been much more careful about the template I used (or rather indirectly authorised another user to use).\n\nHeck, I probably never would have uploaded the image in the first place if I know uploading images of my personal property and en.wiki activity for use in my userpage was such a pain.\n\nI apologize if I'm getting any of this wrong, but it was ten months ago and apparently the only still-live record of the file's early en.wiki history is on my user talk page.\n\nAt this point, I'd really rather just have the image deleted off both Commons and en.wiki and this whole incident just forgotten.\n\nHijiri88 (talk)\n\nRepinging User:Ronhjones. Hijiri88 (talk)\n\nHere is the original entry when first uploaded\n\n== Summary == {{Information |Description = A photo of the address side of a Taiwanese postcard. The postcard was received by me ([[User:Hijiri88]]) on January 11, 2017, for contributions to [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Asian Month|Wikipedia Asian Month 2016]]. Not sure if it was for French or English Wikipedia, but still waiting on the the other one either way (another similar photo will be uploaded then). I am not legitimately sure of the copyright status of the words written on the card, but it's probably fair use to put this photo on my user page either way. (My personal information is blanked out, except for the first line of my address that I already revealed on-wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hijiri88&diff=676672931&oldid=676672756 here].) |Source = I took the photo |Author = Wikimedia Taiwan (portions edited out with sub-text by User:Hijiri88) |Permission = '''Evidence:''' Will be provided on request. }} ;Other information: The following was entered into the boxes for \"non-free\" images because I was being super-careful but was not aware that filling in \"User:Hijiri88\" in the article-for-intended-use box would prevent me from uploading. Wikimedia Taiwan (portions edited out by User:Hijiri88) The photo is mine, but it contains text that was written to me by someone else. Not sure if that means it's copyrighted. This will be used in my (Hijiri88's) user space as an illustration of contributions to Wikipedia Asian Month. Umm... it is text alone. The non-text portion (the fact that it is a photograph) is mine. I don't know. This almost certainly is not a non-free work. I only clicked that option to play it safe. The only conceivable owner, if not me, is Wikimedia itself. I just don't know the copyright status of the non-public text included therein (\"Hi, [...] 亞洲維基人愛你！ Wikiedia Asian Loves you! [...] We appreciate your contribution in Wikimedia(sic) Asian Month in 2016.\"). (But if someone thinks the postage stamp is not covered, that too can be blanked out.) I only intend to use it on [[User:Hijiri88]] and possibly [[User:Hijiri88/Articles I created or significantly contributed to]], but nowhere outside my own user space. == Licensing == I think...? {{Category ordered by date|Files licensed by third parties|2017|01|11}}\n\nImageTaggingBot tagged it as no license, it got changed to PD with the stamp blocked out, and then as a free file it got moved to commons. Without the stamp, it's just text and simple shapes, so PD-textlogo. The image has now been set to non-index, so it won't appear on any search engines. This is better than if it had just been left on en-wiki - google would index it just the same as commons. There is no advantage for the user just to have it on en-wiki. Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nThank you. Yes, I vaguely remember writing that.\n\nIt seems I'm not allowed have an image on my English Wikipedia user page unless I release it into the public domain and have it transferred to Commons? If that's the case, I'd rather just not have the image on my user page, so I've now removed it. It's good that the image no longer appears on search engines, but the file name still appears in the searches for the categories in which it is included.\n\nI'd also still like it deleted. Now that it's no longer in use on any Wikimedia project I can't imagine that being a problem.\n\nHijiri88 (talk)\n\n@Hijiri88: Addressing your first concern, that is correct. You can only have images on your userpage that are free for use elsewhere. Regarding the second concern, you can have it on English Wikipedia. You just have to tag the page with {{KeepLocal}}, which I have now done for you as a courtesy.[10] That said, there is literally no reason to do that. Regarding the third request, you can start a deletion request, and we will consider whether or not to delete as a courtesy. We don't have to, since you released the image under a free license. Magog the Ogre (talk) (contribs)\n\n@Rohnjones: @Magog the Ogre: I have a reasonable-enough response to There is no advantage for the user just to have it on en-wiki. and That said, there is literally no reason to do that., and have emailed both of you. I don't want to send any more emails, so I would appreciate that point not being made by any more people (the only reason I emailed Magog was that their comment was posted while I was drafting the email to Rohnjones). Hijiri88 (talk)\n\nLooks like everything was deleted. Multichill (talk)\n\nHello.\n\nI have a problem with those 3 cats... What's the diffrence?\n\nIn category:Musicians from Czechia we have category:Classical musicians from the Czech Republic or elsewhere category:Musicians from Czechoslovakia...\n\nMay we redirect or leave like that?\n\nThanks LW² \\m/ (Lie ² me...)\n\nRedirect to Czech Republic, but some items may correctly go to Slovakia. --Fæ (talk)\n\nCzechia and Czech Republic are interchangeable, and we really should settle on one or the other. But it seems presumptuous to say that (for example) that a musician whose entire career was in the former country of Czechoslovakia is a \"musician of the Czech Republic\", especially if you don't have the specific knowledge to sort out whether that person is Czech vs. Slovak. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nSo it should stay like this? I don't remember wich kind of musician's cat but I saw a redirect from Czech Rep. to Czechia so each time I had to creatae a cat I created it as \"...from Czechia\" but without knowing really if people was from one or the other... Generally, I use the country I find on Wikis or Internet.\n\nI hope it's not too bad like this. Anyway I keep the mother cat's name when its exists because mainly I create only female/male cats.\n\nIf we have to choose, Czechia is shorter and easier to write, for me.\n\nThanks to all. LW² \\m/ (Lie ² me...)\n\nFYI, there is a related CfD at Commons:Categories for discussion/2016/12/Category:History of Czechia. The decision should be made based on what is standard English usage, not on what is shorter. --Auntof6 (talk)\n\nDoes anyone know Baidu well enough to know if we can trust images from there as being compatibly licensed for here? e.g. File:5646521s21d651s.jpg WereSpielChequers (talk)\n\nIt's as good as saying \"source: Google\". Marked example as no source. --Fæ (talk)\n\nCertainly not. Deleted. Yann (talk)\n\nWikitribune has launched recently. The policy on copyright is at https://www.wikitribune.com/project/copyright/. It would seem sensible to upload all photographs meeting COM:L to Commons, perhaps automatically.\n\nIt's not clear to me how to check whether an image is being hosted on Wikitribune or where the license statement is. Could someone confirm what license this promotional photograph of Jimmy Wales is, and where it is hosted on Wikitribune? https://medium.com/wikitribune/hello-world-this-is-wikitribune-4b46ef829a9a\n\nThanks --Fæ (talk)\n\nThere are so many things wrong with that page on copyright. Rather garbled language wrt copyright and licences and confusion over whether text is CC BY or CC BY-SA, which is a huge difference. Looking throughout the site, I see images with no attribution (especially images that are thumbnail links to articles), images with incomplete attribution (doesn't say or link to where they got it, which is required by most CC licences), an image from Reuters which presumably had to be paid for and won't be free, and an image that claims the licence holder is the subject of the photo, which is often a dubious claim. They will be able to use certain non-free photos under a \"fair use\" claim, but which won't be permitted on Commons.\n\nRight now, I'd say we shouldn't touch their photos with a barge pole, and wait till they get their act together. They could, for example, get sued by Reuters for using a very much all-rights-reserved photo, and Reuters then decided to go after a Commons user who uploaded the image here under the assumption \"Images are generally CC-BY-SA 4.0\" was accurate or useful. -- Colin (talk)\n\nWikitribune is still work in progress. It requires experienced editors with knowledge of copyright (and journalism) to knock it into shape. Won't happen over-night. Just hang in there until Wikitribune has developed comprehensive policies. Then we can appear all knowing by suggesting you RTFM - which we haven't formulated much beyond the basics yet. Still, feel free to put your paddle into the cauldron and stir the pot. P.g.champion (talk)\n\nWell before one starts publishing pictures, I think there need to be a picture editor who knows a thing or two about copyright and licensing. I'm sceptical a newspaper or current-affairs journal can survive without taking agency photos. We want pictures with our news, and we want today's pictures. It becomes very tired very quickly if the only photos you can get e.g., of Theresa May is the official Downing St photo. Unless Wikitribune wants to hire its own photographers, it won't be a source of images for Commons. -- Colin (talk)\n\nThere was a time when newspapers didn't have the printing technology to publish images and they survived. Publications like the Times, once just printed factual content an allowed the reader to make his own mind up. Hopefully, we can get back to those halcyon days -for those that want to know the news and not read yet more chernalisum </rant> . P.g.champion (talk)\n\nI don't think the presence of images has anything to do with churnalism, or of biased proprietors, sloppy journalists, fake news, etc. While early newspapers were indeed rather primitive, they've been illustrated since before photographs were invented. Indeed, until half-toning was invented, an engraver would make a copy of a photograph in order for it to be mass printed, such was the demand for illustrations. Look at any serious newspaper and you will struggle to find any article that is not illustrated with a photograph or artwork of some kind. The idea that one could launch an international news publication without access to current photojournalism is rather ridiculous imo. -- Colin (talk)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nThe Community Wishlist Survey is the process when the Wikimedia communities decide what the Wikimedia Foundation Community Tech team should work on over the next year.\n\nThe Community Tech team is focused on tools for experienced Wikimedia editors. You can post technical proposals from now until November 20. The communities will vote on the proposals between November 28 and December 12. You can read more on the 2017 wishlist survey page. /Johan (WMF) (talk)\n\n…«is focused on tools for experienced Wikimedia editors» Hahaha, good one. Tell us more ironical absurdist jokes, please. -- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nTuválkin If you do not like the tools Community Tech team is focusing on than you should propose your own ideas at 2017 wishlist survey page or vote on ideas you like. If you do not vote or your opinion is in minority than you should not be sarcastic about what others decided the priorities should be. In my book some of the things created by tech team is truly awesome: quarry, Wikidata Query servise, cross-project notifications, Wikidata, Lua, Kartographer Map support, etc. come to mind. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nBitter sarcasm is the penultimate consolation of the defeated (the ultimate being to be able «I told you so» while scavenging the ruins of a once great civilization). In general, the WMF and a shockingly large group of enablers has never been about empowering «experienced Wikimedia editors», quite the opposite — not as a conspiracy, even, but out in the open. There is an obvious trend to dumb down everything the hoipolloi is allowed to do (down to “gamification” of Wikipedia editing!!) while driving a wedge between said hoipolloi and experienced editors. You mentioned LUA and Wikidata as a good thing: Well, even if/when they work flawlessly, in practice they mean that things that were previously done in wikitext now need a passable familiarity with JSON to be understood, let alone influenced. Wikitext presents a smooth learning curve, from merely entering text up to creating (and mantaining and improving) “esoteric” templates. Replacing wikitext is the current trend (as clearly stated; not a conspiracy) and that transforms the said sweet smooth curve into an unsurmountable learning cliff — aiding (along with other trends elsewhere) to halt the sociological movement that started off in the 1980s with the popularization of computing, a movement of which Wikimedia projects are one of the most impressive and positive results. Quarry is a great tool, sure, but most of the great tools that we use in Commons were not created by any WMF outfit, but by individual users: Created without any support from the WMF and often having to picked up in pieces after some WMF-sponsored change affects those tools. WMF’s forays into introducing tech novelties (under the name Community Tech or not) include widely dispised contraptions such as MediaViewer, Flow, the typographic update, VisualEditor, Wikidata as a whole, and more I’m fortunate to have momentarily forgotten. One or two good things Community Tech might have done matters little on the face of the wrong things that are done (and planned). And that’s the tally I’m counting. -- Tuválkin ✉ ✇\n\nMan your life must suck. Having to deal with all those emotions every time your bank website changes, or when your phone has an update and stuff... luckily there is this place where you are allowed to give at least some input ! —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nTuvalkin -- I really would not group Wikidata in with some of those other things. It originated from a German group (not the narrow clique of WMF-employed programmers whose efforts sometimes yield strange results), and ordinary article-editors on the individual Wikipedias and ordinary image-uploaders on Commons barely notice it (which is the intention)...

This image appears to be of the AIG Insurance Company building, which is to the southeast of the station and is located in Altyre Road, Croydon. It is still standing and is not part of the proposed development of the Ruskin Square / Wettern House site. This file is extracted from another, that being File:East Croydon Station looking south (geograph 1935542).jpg where the description is accurate. Should the mislabelled file (Wettern House) be deleted from Commons as it is incorrectly described but the original retained? Thank you.
