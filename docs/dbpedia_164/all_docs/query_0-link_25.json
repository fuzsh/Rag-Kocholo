The work shall continue on Phabricator, for further discussion COM:VPT is a better place. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nThe MIDI Files category only has 946 files. Most of them are more than 10 years old, and many of them only have a few seconds of audio.\n\nOne reason for the low participation in this category is that there was previously no method to view and edit a MIDI file online; you had to download a program.\n\nThe first Online Midi Editor was created two years ago, and it was recently moved to a new domain: https://OnlineMidi.com\n\nI would like to request permission to create a page in Commons which describes OnlineMidi.com, since it is the only Online Midi Editor on the entire web. I noticed that the VicuñaUploader received its own page in Commons, and a special mention on the Commons 'Welcome' page (under 'Additional services and software').\n\nI would also like to propose adding a link to each midi file's thumbnail and profile, which will import and display that midi file at OnlineMidi.com. For example, the following link displays the midi file for \"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane: https://OnlineMidi.com?s=aNVf\n\nThis will be very simple to implement. The link from WP to OnlineMidi.com will include a 'wp_url' parameter, which will allow OnlineMidi.com to import and display that midi file. — Preceding unsigned comment added by ToolCreator (talk • contribs) 8 October 2019 21:00 (UTC)\n\nI personally have no issue with a page that describes how to use onlinemidi.com, as long as it's educational. If there are people who would find this useful, a gadget could probably be created to link to onlinemidi.com with a file from Commons loaded. There are 5,645 MIDI files on Commons by the way.- Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI feel the same way as Alex. But that website literally doesn't have any API or anything of the sort. At least I couldn't find any similar features either. It doesn't even support upload by URL, meaning files have to be uploaded by a user's device. So creating a gadget might be a difficult task. Masum Reza📞\n\nThis URL (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:MIDI_files) displays \"The following 200 files are in this category, out of 946 total.\" Please indicate why this count differs with your search, which showed \"5,645 MIDI files on Commons\".\n\nI can provide an example which shows how OnlineMidi.com can import and display the midi file when the following URL is sent as a GET parameter: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/%22Texarkana_and_Northern%22_Boogie-woogie_bassline.mid\n\nI can also create an educational webpage which describes how to use OnlineMidi.com with midi files received from Commons.\n\nBefore doing so, please confirm that my efforts will not be rejected for some other reason (like \"insufficient citations\"). I'd hate to waste my time.\n\nI enormously appreciate your positive response to my proposal, thank you! ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@ToolCreator: Because not all MIDI files are in that category. For example, Category:MIDI files of music by Johann Sebastian Bach has 78 files in it. (and its subcategories another 21) Citations are no issue. We'd mostly be concerned about whether or not something is in scope. A general page about MIDI would be better suited for Wikipedia or Wikibooks. For general instructions for a universally known tool like Photoshop, Wikibooks is probably best. Of course, it should be relevant for Commons. For example, the checklist on COM:Colorization is relevant. And finally it shouldn't be spammy. Considering onlinemidi.com appears to be ad-free and not selling subscriptions, I'd say that's fine. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Alexis Jazz: The example I described will be shown here tomorrow (which will import and display the midi file when the upload.wikimedia.org URL is sent as a GET parameter to OnlineMidi.com). How long will it take for an [Edit MIDI] link to be added to each midi file's thumbnail and profile at Commons? ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@ToolCreator: No links will be added directly to files. A gadget could be made for this (not by me, I lack the knowledge) which could be enabled by users who want it. It shouldn't be too hard though because we already have gadgets for Google Images and Tineye which do the same kind of thing. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Alexis Jazz: I can create the gadget. I just don't know how to send a GET request to that website. @ToolCreator: Please show us an example. What are the GET parameters, and call URL? Masum Reza📞\n\nThe following two URL's demonstrate how OnlineMidi.com can import a MIDI file from Commons:\n\nhttps://www.onlinemidi.com?wp=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Chopin_-_Etude_Op._10%2C_No._1.mid https://www.onlinemidi.com?wp=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Camptown_Races_%281850%29%2C_composed_by_Stephen_Foster.mid\n\nEach MIDI file's download address can be found on the file's Commons webpage, under \"File history\" in the \"Date/Time\" column. For example:\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chopin_-_Etude_Op._10,_No._1.mid\n\nYou can create [View MIDI] links to OnlineMidi.com, by adding each MIDI file's download address to the right of \"?wp=\" in the outgoing link URL.\n\nI think [View MIDI] would be a better caption for the links, instead of [Edit MIDI].\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nFolks can use for the past 6 years, the Score extension to get MIDI files out of Lilypond notation. Wouldn’t that be one of reasons we have few MIDI files? Jean-Fred (talk)\n\n@Masumrezarock100: @Alexis Jazz: I created the page for OnlineMidi.com (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OnlineMidi.com). I think you will find it to be educational. Let me know if you need anything else to create the gadget. ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@ToolCreator: Very nice! I moved the page to Commons:OnlineMidi.com. (we keep help pages in the Commons: namespace) - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI've created a pretty basic version of the gadget based on the TinEye gadget. But it is for some reason, loading on image file pages instead of mid file pages. It is located here. I can't seem to figure out where I made a mistake. We'll need to work on it more. @Perhelion: perhaps you can lend me a hand? Masum Reza📞\n\nMasumrezarock100, try this:\n\n/* OnlineMidi gadget code start. Depends on mediawiki.util. */ $.when(mw.loader.using('mediawiki.util'),$.ready).then(function(){ 'use strict'; if(mw.config.get('wgNamespaceNumber')==6&&mw.config.get('wgAction')===\"view\"&&document.getElementById('file')){ varmid=document.getElementsByClassName('fullMedia')[0].getElementsByTagName('a'); varmidURL=mid[0].href; //Conditionally add the portlet link if(midURL.substr(midURL.length-4,midURL.length).toLowerCase()=='.mid'){ mw.util.addPortletLink('p-cactions','https://www.onlinemidi.com/Editor.php?wp='+encodeURIComponent(midURL),'Edit MIDI','ca-midiedit',null).children[0].target='_blank'; } } });\n\nI needed to change the element to source/construct the actual media url from, and added a condition. It should only activate if the extension is .mid. I tested the generated url at onlinemidi for a couple and it seems to work. You might need to tinker with the condition if you need to allow for any different extension, but that should be easy enough to do... -- Begoon\n\n@Masumrezarock100: @Alexis Jazz: Thank you for your efforts. I think everyone will want to view the midi notes, so I hope you can make this gadget run by default. Otherwise, very few people will know that this feature exists.\n\nAlso, please mention Commons:OnlineMidi.com on the Commons Home or Welcome page. I noticed that VicuñaUploader received a special mention on the Commons 'Welcome' page (under 'Additional services and software'), so I hope that OnlineMidi has the same relevancy. If more people knew about the capabilities of MIDI files (as demonstrated by the Sample Midi Files listed at Commons:OnlineMidi.com), then you would receive more new submissions.\n\nIt is an honor and a pleasure helping your fine organization. ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@Begoon: Thanks for fixing the bug. It is working fine now. We can move the script to Mediawiki gadget namespace once this discussion is closed. @ToolCreator: For now, copy-paste the following code to your Special:MyPage/common.js to install the script. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: The link you provided (Special:MyPage/common.js) displays \"This page does not currently exist.\" ToolCreator (talk)\n\nIt should say \"This page does not currently exist. You can search for this page title in other pages or create this page.\" and the words \"create this page\" are a link, which you can click to create the page. -- Begoon\n\nYes, create the page with the code I posted. Navigate to a mid file, and click the more collapsible drop-down. And you should see a Edit MIDI link. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: Yes, it works, thank you! What is the process to make this a default gadget? ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@ToolCreator and Begoon: I went ahead and optimized this script for mobile. It should now load on the mobile website. Head over to a mid file on the mobile website (eg. https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chopin_-_Etude_Op._10,_No._1.mid), and you should see a similar button. Regarding making it a gadget, as I've said, it will be moved to the Mediawiki gadget space once this proposal is accepted. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: You may not want the link to appear on the mobile website, because the midi editor requires more screen space than most mobile devices can handle.\n\n@Masumrezarock100: Just so I know how often to check back, how long does it usually take for a proposal to be accepted? This page lists 11 Gadgets (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets). Is there another page that lists more? ToolCreator (talk)\n\nAh, I didn't think about that. It makes sense to me. We can change it's definitions so that it won't load on the mobile. However, I suggest the Minerva skin part to be kept, since there are some users who use Minerva skin on desktop site. On English Wikipedia, a discussion usually takes place for minimum 7 days. You can assume the same for Commons. All gadgets on Wikimedia Commons are listed at Special:Gadgets. -Masum Reza📞\n\nWhat is the sort order of midi files that are shown at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:MIDI_files? Can the user select a different sort order? ToolCreator (talk)\n\nAlphabetical order. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to sort out files in a category at the moment. Perhaps a gadget could be created to support changing sort order. Masum Reza📞\n\nI do not endorse making special mentions and/or creating a default gadget to a proprietary tool that does not even have a privacy policy. If one uses this tool to edit MIDI, then it is their own choice. --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\n@Zhuyifei1999: Please describe the additions you would like to see in the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com, to satisfy the requirement for a privacy policy. Please also provide the address of the page that lists default gadgets. Thanks! ToolCreator (talk)\n\nOh, that would be fun:\n\n\"Proprietary\": Release your source code under FOSS license\n\n\"Privacy Policy\": List clearly what data you will collect from end users, and explain what you will do with the data, and under what circumstances will you release the data to third parties. See foundation:Privacy_policy for an example.\n\nThe list of gadgets are at Special:Gadgets. The default ones are listed with \"Enabled for everyone by default.\" --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\n@Zhuyifei1999: Thank you for your advice.

If that is not the case, then please indicate any other changes that I should make. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nNot releasing any information... including law enforcement?\n\nBy under 'FOSS' I mean 'free and open source software', free as in libre, free as in free speech, not free beer. We need the right to run your code for any purpose, study your code, modify, fork, redistribute, for any purpose, including commercial, without restrictions. Your 'Copyrights' section clearly differs. --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nI have the same concern.

No part of this program may be copied, reproduced, translated, or reduced to any electronic or machine readable form without the prior written consent of OnlineMidi.com.\n\nAm I understanding it correctly that all media files taken from the website are copyrignted including the mid files uploaded to the the website after an user edits them? So let's say a user uploads a file to OnlineMidi, and then edits it using the website. Who is the copyrignt holder of the new (edited) file and what it is new license? We have a goal to provide free educational files. Does this website meets our licensing requirements? 19:12, 10 October 2019 (UTC)\n\n@Zhuyifei1999: As per your suggestion, I changed the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com to clarify that the user's data \"...shall never be released to any other entities (unless legally ordered to do so)\".\n\nRegarding the justifiable concern that uploaded midi files would become the ownership of the site, I have added the following sentence to that paragraph: \"This copyright does NOT include data that is created or uploaded by a user.\".\n\nThere are other gadgets that have been \"Enabled for everyone by default\" which do not allow others to \"redistribute, for any purpose, including commercial, without restrictions.\", so that is apparently not a requirement. ToolCreator (talk)\n\n\"There are other gadgets that have been ... which do not allow others to ...\" for example? --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\n@ToolCreator: I'm not a lawyer, but here's a suggestion:\n\nThis service embeds content from Soundcloud.com which may use cookies and collect the data from your HTTP-request.

Your website states that even texts are copyrignted. Please license it to us and update your Copyrignt policy, or rewrite the whole help page on Commons using your own words. Pages with excessive copyrighted are subject for speedy deletion per G11 criteria. Thanks you for your understanding. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: I modified the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com to indicate that Wikipedia Commons has permission to re-publish text from the OnlineMidi.com Help page (https://www.onlinemidi.com/Help.php). Do I need to take any other action regarding this issue? ToolCreator (talk)\n\nSo here's the thing, Wikimedia Foundation provides free access to open knowledge and allows anyone to use it's content. As you might have noticed, the footer of every pages has the following text.\n\nFiles are available under licenses specified on their description page. All structured data from the file and property namespaces is available under the Creative Commons CC0 License; all unstructured text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.\n\nAs Wikimedia Commons is one of Wikimedia Foundation's projects, anyone can copy, modify, and distribute its content (which are hosted on this site), or use it for any other purposes (even for commercial purposes), provided he/she abides by the terms of licensing. You gave only Wikipedia and Commons to use your website's content. So if I were to copy/use the texts from the OnlineMidi page on Wikimedia Commons, it would be a copyrignt violation, because I don't have permission! You see what I mean? Unfortunately Wikimedia projects can not host such content. Please update your Copyrignt policies and license it under one of the free licenses. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: Please provide the proper wording that I can add to the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com, to indicate that the text from the OnlineMidi.com Help page is properly licensed to appear on the Commons page.ToolCreator (talk)\n\nThe wording depends on what license you choose. It is generally recommended to license it under one of the Creative Commons licenses. There are plenty of CC license tags that you can use. See Category:CC_license_tags. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: If I place the following statement in the Terms of Use, will that suffice:\n\nThe OnlineMidi.com Help page (https://www.onlinemidi.com/Help.php) is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike CC BY-NC-SA License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). ToolCreator (talk)\n\nAh, drop the non-commercial part. Commons doesn't allow Non-commercial and non-derivative works licenses. Also why only freely license the help page? It doesn't hurt to license all texts of the website under a free license. Those are just simple texts nothing special. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: The https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ website says \"This is the license used by Wikipedia\", so I assume this will work. Do I have to do anything other than adding this sentence to my Terms of Use webpage?\n\nThe OnlineMidi.com Help page (https://www.onlinemidi.com/Help.php) is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). ToolCreator (talk)\n\nIt doesn't explicitly states what license Wikimedia Commons uses. Per COM:L, ND and NC licenses are not acceptable on Commons.\n\nDo readers a favor and clearly state how text portion in the help page can be used and what is it's copyrignt status. Just simply linking to a CC license page doesn't help. See Template:CC-by-sa-4.0 for an example. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: I added the text from the template that you suggested, to the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com. Please see paragraph 8 in that document. I also added the following statement to Commons:OnlineMidi.com: \"This page contains text from the OnlineMidi.com Help Page, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA License.\"\n\nPlease confirm that this issue is resolved. Thanks! ToolCreator (talk)\n\n@Zhuyifei1999: The gadget itself will be 'free and open source software', as are all the javascript gadgets on the Special:Gadgets page. Each gadget is simply a javascript snippet that is free for anyone to use; that is a condition for the gadget to be placed on the Special:Gadgets page.\n\nHowever, the websites, software, and data that the gadgets access are obviously not all 'free and open source software'. For example, if a gadget launches a PDF file, that doesn't mean that everyone can \"redistribute, for any purpose, including commercial, without restrictions\" all of Adobe's software.\n\nHere are two examples of gadgets that are \"Enabled for everyone by default\" that access software and/or data that is not \"FOSS\":\n\n1. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Gadget-Stockphoto \"Email a link: Starts an e-mail with a link to the file and a credit line\" This gadget must be launching email software that is not FOSS (like Gmail or Outlook).\n\n2. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiMiniAtlas \"additional data courtesy of the US National Park Service, Landsat7 data courtesy of NASA.\" The US National Park Service and NASA do not allow others to \"redistribute, for any purpose, including commercial, without restrictions\" all of their data and software.\n\nThe proposed gadget will be FOSS: the javascript code will be FOSS. The site that it accesses (OnlineMidi.com) has the Terms of Use for OnlineMidi.com.\n\nYou will be tremendously limiting the capabilities of gadgets if you do not allow them to access websites, software, and data that are not FOSS. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nStock photo does not explicitly launch any proprietary software. Some of us use FOSS email clients, such as Thunderbird to handle emails. If a client binds mailto: to Gmail or Outlook, then they are expected to be fully aware that they are using such service. Again, we don't endorse proprietary software; if you use them as your email client it is your choosing.\n\nSince when has NASA claimed copyright? Maybe 'some' of their data and software, but the data being displayed is libre.\n\nYou claim that \"the javascript code will be FOSS\"; can I know what licenses they are under? --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nYou claim that \"the javascript code will be FOSS\"; if you mean that the gadget itself is FOSS, yes; however, setting it as a default gadget imply that we endorse your site. No, we don't endorse any specific proprietary software. --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nI don't see any benefit in making this gadget default. If someone wants to use this gadget to edit MID files they should enable it by themselves. It would be just advertising your site if we make it default. Masum Reza📞\n\n1. Can I use the midi player that is on your site to hear what a file will sound like before I upload it? 2. After I upload a file, can I delete or replace it?ToolCreator (talk)\n\nThe MIDI -> waveform conversion is done by one of the two extensions: mw:Extension:TimedMediaHandler & mw:Extension:Score. I think you can either host a MediaWiki install yourself with these exiensions, and you can refer to our onfigueration. Another way would be that you can try to figure out what commands these extensions use to do the conversion by reading its source code.\n\nYou can replace it by overwriting it with another file, but the file history will still be visible to public. For deletion, file a speedy deleion request --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nI uploaded the following example, to show you what OnlineMidi.com can do: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22_OnlineMidi.com%22_9.mid\n\nPlease listen to this file at the following link, which the proposed gadget directs to: https://www.onlinemidi.com?wp=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/%22_OnlineMidi.com%22_9.mid\n\nYou will see that this midi file includes audio for live drums, guitars, and female vocals. There is no other website that does this.\n\nI noticed that nearly every midi file in your directory contains just a few notes (and usually only one instrument), which causes them to normally receive less than 5 page views in the past 30 days.\n\nMany musicians would like to include your fantastic collection of audio files within their midi files, but if they don't know about OnlineMidi, then they won't know that they have that capability. I am friends with several film composers who would not use the OnlineMidi gadget unless it was a default gadget.\n\nYour team has been fantastic in patiently guiding me through the WikiMedia process (which I am obviously new at). I sincerely believe that if this gadget is made to run by default, it will increase the quality of midi files in your directory. If it is not a default gadget, then very few people will know it exists. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nAt Template talk:Information I suggested an expansion. -- sarang♥사랑\n\nSupport I agree, many *.svg have \"SVG development\"-information using TEM:Image generation, which is stored in other fields= which is IMHO not really adequat. — Johannes Kalliauer - Talk | Contributions\n\nSee an example: Shuttle.svg where in the /sandbox the new adequat parameter is used. -- sarang♥사랑\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: -- sarang♥사랑\n\nWouldn't that make them much easier to judge?\n\nObviously, galleries would only be visible on the DR page like Commons:Deletion requests/File:Example.jpg. They would not be included on overview pages like Commons:Deletion_requests/2019/09/30.\n\n{{Delreqnom}} could be used for this. Examples at User:Alexis Reggae/delreqnomsandbox and User:Alexis Reggae/delreqnomsandboxtranscluded. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nAdd galleries to deletion requests: votes\n\nSupport - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSupport -Masum Reza📞\n\nWeak support, I like the idea, but as a mobile user this will mean minutes of scrolling per large deletion request. And some random IP that spots potential child pornography would probably nominate it for deletion because they don't know that speedy deletions exist, but I don't think (hope!!!) that much child pornography gets uploaded to Wikimedia Commons anyhow. There should be a way to (temporarily) disable these galleries for mobile users until we can collapse templates. This is also the only time when less functionality might actually benefit mobile users. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nYes plz. Long overdue. I always copy a long list into regexr.com, trunc the brackets, put it into a page and preview. This should be done by the suggested template or a gadget/script at least.--Roy17 (talk)\n\nSupport.--Vulphere\n\nAdd galleries to deletion requests: discussion\n\nFor many DRs, that would be helpful. If there are say 200 images, I'm less sure about that. And sometimes people mark comments on the end of the filename line, which you can't do in a gallery. But I guess you could do the same in that collapsed section. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\n@Clindberg: I made a template to dynamically switch between the list and the gallery plus hidden list while preserving comments: here is an example. @Masumrezarock100: that okay for you too? (template can be tweaked to make the gallery more appealing) - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI applied it to Commons:Deletion requests/Files found with \"wines-world.over-blog.com\" (transcluded version) for testing, this works fine with delreqhandler (sort of important for admins ) too. The image width in the gallery needs to be adjusted. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nHmm, the gallery layout could be improved. I suggest to make it's style more like Commons:Quality_images_candidates/candidate_list. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: That would be nice, but that page also uses the gallery tag, which I can't use. And CSS makes my head hurt. {{Delreqnom/galleryitem}} is what needs to be improved btw. To do list on {{Delreqnom}}. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Clindberg: I've now limited the template to 80 files+comments total by default. (funny thing: there is no way to tell how many files there are, only the total of files and comments is known) This means that by default, you'll see somewhere between 40 and 80 files. (depending on how many have comments) Also, the thumbnails over 40 are hidden by default under a \"Show more thumbnails\" link. So by default, you'll see between 20 and 40 thumbnails and another 20 to 40 hidden under that \"Show more thumbnails\" link. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Donald Trung: Such uploads are rare as far as I know. I encountered it once (and reported it, it was only nudity IIRC, no interaction, though I didn't check the other uploads from the user), back when I was a newbie. I actually think it wouldn't have shocked me as much if I had only seen a gallery thumbnail. The gallery can be removed by editing the wikitext in individual cases anyway. (just remove \"mode=gallery\") It's possible to collapse the gallery, and this could be enabled/disabled with a gadget. I don't know if it is possible to make a template always behave differently on mobile. It would make sense to further restrict the maximum number of thumbnails on mobile. @Perhelion: do you know if that's possible, making mobile-specific tweaks? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSome clarification, the main reason for adding \"weak\" to my support vote is actually not related to child pornography which is extremely rare on Wikimedia Commons (things like \"the black web\" or \"deepweb\" serve things like this), and Wikimedia Commons' new page patrollers (the general grouping of people, not just people with the user right) and the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) actually handle it really well. I really like this idea as it will allow for people to make better decisions without opening lots of tabs. With \"COM:SCOPE\"-based deletion requests I expect this to be very helpful.\n\nI actually only think that this might be bad when using the mobile browser view for \"large\" deletion requests, maybe we could make something like \"<nomobile></nomobile>\" that doesn't display when someone has the \"Mobile view\" enabled. But again, 99% (ninety-nine percent) of the time this gallery won't be a disadvantage, only with deletion requests that concern more than like 50 (fifty) or so files. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\n@Donald Trung: Yes, I will be adding some limits. For mobile, I think there probably is a CSS class that would display:none on mobile but be ignored otherwise. I just don't know what the name of that class might be. If it doesn't exist, we could probably add it. This maybe won't stop the extra thumbnails from being downloaded (depending on your browser maybe), but they won't be displayed. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Donald Trung: if you add \".delreqgalover25, .delreqgalover50, .delreqgalover100, .delreqgalover200 { display: none !important }\" to User:Donald Trung/common.css you'll never see more than 25 thumbnails. And with \".delreqgalunder25, .delreqgalover25, .delreqgalover50, .delreqgalover100, .delreqgalover200 { display: none !important }\" you would see no thumbnails. This could be made into gadgets or default for mobile. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Roy17, Donald Trung, and Clindberg: I changed some more things. Examples at User:Alexis Reggae/delreqnomsandbox and User:Alexis Reggae/delreqnomsandboxtranscluded. CSS guru for Template:Delreqnom/galleryitem still wanted to make it look prettier. Getting those comments/filenames on the same height is probably just a matter of a well-placed margin, align, padding or whatever.. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nDone (wasn't entirely as simple as I thought) - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nUndo feature in mobile website (Minerva skin) is a long sought feature. But it is possible to undo a diff using mobile website manually. Reading web team is currently working on Advanced mobile contributions project. They have added a undo button to history pages. But a undo button on diff pages is still missing. This task has been tracked in phab:T191706 but Reading web team isn't working on it despite it had been triaged as high priority. It is clear that there is a demand for this feature, see some related discussions on Mediawiki - mw:Topic:V8wxfm4a02x9glpw, mw:Topic:V77gwos6xmvslqz2, mw:Topic:V484smre28nqxvdh. In the meantime, FR30799386 has developed an user script to replicate this feature. There are many mobile contributors, but only a handful of them know about this script. Because of that many editors can not undo edits on mobile. We would like to implement this user script as a gadget. But I thought we should gain support from the community, and which is why I am proposing to make this script a gadget. Jon Robson also proposed the same thing on English wikipedia. All mobile users especially those who are active in countering vandalism and use mobile, will benefit from this. It works cross-wiki and also supports internationalization meaning it can be translated to one's preferred language. Thanks. Masum Reza📞\n\nAdd mobileUndo gadget: votes\n\nSupport as proposer. Masum Reza📞\n\nSupport, though I am certain that it will become the rule once \"the Advanced Mobile Mode\" will become the standard mobile mode, in fact I can't wait for the featureless Mobile mode to be completely abolished. Why is a dumbed down version of the MediaWiki software somehow \"friendlier\" for mobile users? --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nAdd mobileUndo gadget: discussions\n\nSome pings. @94rain, Jdlrobson, and Donald Trung: Masum Reza📞\n\nAccording to mw:Reading/Web/Advanced mobile contributions, \"August 8, 2019 ... Advanced mode is now available on all Wikipedias\". When it will be deployed on Commons? 4nn1l2 (talk)\n\n@4nn1l2: , it was rolled out to Wikimedia Commons, and had been available since yesterday. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\n@4nn1l2: Yes, Advanced mode is currently available in all Wikimedia projects. The task is here. I've asked Johan (WMF) to announce it in the next Tech news. Masum Reza📞\n\nQuestion, I have a question, shouldn't this request better be filed in the Phabricator? As far as I can tell this is an uncontroversial change. There is no policy and/or guideline stating that mobile users shouldn't be able to undo edits using the \"mobile view\", in fact this is a mere technical restriction. Yes, it is still a proposal, but it's not like if someone would enable it today that it would be seen as controversial in any way. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nWe don't have plans to make advanced mode default for everyone. But we'll transfer some of its features to all logged in users. Masum Reza📞\n\nI Genuinely can't see the logic behind this, most users start editing Wikimedia projects / websites usually after first making edits without registering a Wikimedia SUL account, if we hide user-friendly features from novice users then they are less likely to become editors who could have been major editors to this (and other Wikimedia) website(s). I do not see how it serves anyone to give them \"a dumbed down experience\", especially for new markets like India where desktop users will be rarer. This policy is almost certainly one that will be a disadvantage for users from developing countries. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nI understand what you are saying but some editors prefer the old version mostly because of its simplicity. And some old mobile browsers don't even support JavaScript. There was 81% retention rate when AMC first had been deployed to 7 Wikipedias. This means that some still use the non-AMC mode. And 19% is still a big number. See some related discussions on Mediawiki - mw:Topic:V5fyhptg7yeuhi1s and mw:Topic:V64xirqg9ncsv7dh. Though I agree that IP editors should have access to this mode. OVasileva (WMF) is Reading web teams' product manager, and she makes all decision for this project. She might know more. If you have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask at mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Advanced mobile contributions. Thanks. Masum Reza📞\n\nThanks for the reply, I will look into it. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nSome days ago, I was reading an article in enwiki using my mobile phone in old, non-advanced mode. I noticed some kind of CentralNotice there, inviting users to enable Advanced Mode. I think having such notice here would be useful. Ahmadtalk\n\nThat is called AMC Outreach Modal, not Central notice. That modal is designed to trigger when an eligible user performs certain actions. See phab:T226068. Masum Reza📞\n\nYes, that's it. Thank you.

They don't exclude each other. @Johanna Strodt (WMDE): if we greenlight option 3, are you taking option 2 off the table? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSupport It will make it easier for patrollers who are familiar with languages other than English to patrol edits from other wikis, and can also help in backlogs. Ahmadtalk\n\nDiscussion (Make it easier for the Commons community to identify from which wiki FileExporter file transfers are coming using a template which applies maintenance categories)\n\nComment, I would preferably see the imports organised like OrgeBots daily uploads by users with less than 250 (two-hundred-fifty) edits + (PLUS) these files being added to a larger more general maintenance category per non-Wikimedia Commons wiki. That way files could be patrolled more easily, if they would all be dumped into a single category that only allows us to see them alphabetically and not based on upload date then we won't be able to properly find new files. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\n@Donald Trung: We could have the template categorize by source wiki language, source project, and import date. Magog the Ogre would then have sufficient information for his bot to make reports. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nI would like to create a Filter and Sort WikiMedia Commons Files website that offers features that are not currently offered by Special Pages, Templates, or the WikiMedia Commons API.\n\nIn addition to Filtering by all available fields, this website will also Sort by all available fields, including the following:\n\nUploaded Date\n\nFile Size\n\nPage Views\n\nDownloads\n\nTo accomplish this, the website will cache the data so it can be filtered and sorted by any field.\n\nHere are two examples of features that I could not find in WikiMedia Commons, which this website will offer:\n\nDisplay the most recently uploaded Midi files.\n\nShow files in order of their File Size, PageViews, or Downloads.\n\nWikimedia Commons has pages that offer some of these features, but you can't combine the filter and sort. For example, this page lists all 'audio/midi' files, but you can't see the most recently uploaded files: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MIMESearch/audio/midi\n\nThis page indicates that searching by Mime Type (aimime) is \"Disabled due to miser mode\". Therefore, using the current API, you can't search for 'audio/midi' files (I don't know how the **MIMESearch** page does it): https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Allimages\n\nPlease confirm that I can create a WikiMedia Commons page which describes the Filter and Sort WikiMedia Commons Files website, and that I can display this page in the \"Pages in category\" section of all WikiMedia Commons pages that list files.\n\nThis proposed website will contain no advertising or subscription fees. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nSounds like a good plan to me. The current Mediawiki sorting system is not good at all IMO. @ToolCreator: There is no need to create and manage a separate domain/website. Wikimedia Toolforge would like to host such tools. Please see toollabs: and wikitech:Nova_Resource:Tools/Getting_started. Thanks. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: Thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately, Toolforge has strict limitations upon the usage of cron, which would be required to create this application. Without those limitations, a poorly created Toolforge application could bring the entire system down. For that reason, a dedicated server is usually required for unlimited cron usage. For more information about this issue, search Google for \"toolforge cron\".\n\nThat is probably why no one has yet created the application that I described, even though there should be a huge demand for the ability to sort the files.\n\nI understand your concern. However, please note that this application would be read-only, so there is no risk of negative effects upon your data. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nRegarding toolforge, you should submit a job to grid engine which avoids much of the limitations of bare cron. Wikimedia Cloud VPS also exist.\n\nIf you do decide to host it externally, please note that some of us (me included) may be somewhat hostile to it.\n\nBy the way, do you realize Special:Search is awesome? --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\nRegarding Special Search: Where is the \"filemime\" parameter documented? Also, the only sorts offered are Relevance and Date. My website would allow you to sort by any field; including File Size, Page Views, and Downloads.\n\nRegarding the cloud server: There are always more limitations upon a cloud server, than on a dedicated server. For that reason, I would not want to incur that inconvenience, for a read-only website that does not require any additional permissions. That's why I pay thousands of dollars a year for a dedicated server.\n\nI could have this website up in 1-2 weeks. If you can find someone else to create it on your cloud server, then go for it. Otherwise, I would need to know that you would not be hostile towards it. Your users would need to know that it exists. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nI found the answer to my 'filemime' question. This page lists the four file properties that you can search for: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:CirrusSearch. ToolCreator (talk)\n\nAlso, thank you for the information that you provided. I did not know about that Special Search page, which is very useful. I also did not know that WikiMedia offers usage of their cloud server for free, which I will definitely look into. I guess there is no reason for anyone to pay Amazon! ToolCreator (talk)\n\nPer this post regarding FileExporter's \"Export to Wikimedia Commons\" button on other wikis and the resulting files here on Commons, Johanna Strodt (WMDE) wants to know if we approve of the subject (option 2 in her post). See also COM:VPT#FileExporter/FileImporter: Suggestions how to deal with files from wikis that have a higher amount of copyright violations. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nVotes (Show the FileExporter's \"Export to Wikimedia Commons\" button only to users on other wikis with certain rights)\n\nSupport as proposer. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nNah File exporter automatically exports page history and all old versions of a file. If we show the button to only user with certain rights, others will find alternatives such as Commonshelper. And this will only raise the backlog of Bot move to Commons category. Files transferred using Commonshelper usually needs cleanup. And it doesn't even transfer old versions and page history which is required for attribution. File exporter automatically cleans up file pages, blocks files from transferring with unsupported license, detects abuse filter blocking, and it has many more feature that Commonshelper doesn't. Besides just because a user has few more rights doesn't necessarily mean that user has more experience. So suppose that a experienced editor (on Commons/or a wiki) wants to move files from another wiki (where they don't have the necessary rights) to Commons using file exporter. They wouldn't be able to use this feature and they would just use alternative methods as I've mentioned. We can not give out rights to every experienced user on every wikis. Also even if we hide that portlet link, it can be easily replicated using user scripts. And anyone can easily use this feature that way. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: what scripts? — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nSeeing that FileImporter is optimized for mobile and there is no direct links to the FileImporter in mobile site, I've created a script for mobile which adds an Export to Wikimedia Commons button. Just import it in your minerva.js in English Wikipedia and navigate to a local file to see the demo. This means anyone can create a script to use the FileImporter. Masum Reza📞\n\nNO. What's the purpose of this? To increase the amount of files in the bot script backlog? I hate using CommonsHelper. Calvinkulit • t • c\n\nDiscussion (Show the FileExporter's \"Export to Wikimedia Commons\" button only to users on other wikis with certain rights)\n\n@Jeff G.: , would it be possible to add multiple options for which user rights (if any) should be given this option? I personally would like to see every registered user be able to do this, unless they've abused the function. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\n@Donald Trung: I would hope so. An example \"file exporter\" user right could be held by members of a \"File Exporters\" group on (for example) Arabic Wikipedia, once the coding and infrastructure are in place. It might also make sense to have a corresponding \"file importer\" right and \"File Importers\" group here if importation gets out of hand. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\n@Jeff G.: , that is a really good idea, especially if any user can then tag a file for transfer to Wikimedia Commons, but that then a \"File exporter\" with sufficient knowledge of copyright (and perhaps Wikimedia Commons categorisation, rules, and guidelines) will then actually decide if it is or isn't compatible with Wikimedia Commons. If this proposal asks for the creation of this specific right I would support it, otherwise it should be \"an option on the ballot 🗳\". --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\n@Donald Trung: Actually, given the vetting, knowledge, and experience of License Reviewers here, I think it would be fair to give them this right. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\n@Jeff G. and Johanna Strodt (WMDE): Certain rights where? On Commons? On the Wiki someone tries to import from? Certain rights here is probably not workable. Certain rights on the exporting wikis is possible, but I suspect we can't actually enforce that. Even if we forced a new user group upon them, they could give the right to anyone who asks for it. I think this will only make sense if Commons gets the right to block a wiki (or even individual users) from importing their files here. That will force them to make sure only users who understand imports do them. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Alexis Jazz: I meant certain rights on other wikis. The reason the subject came up is that جار الله (an Admin on Arabic Wikipedia) wrote a bot to transfer templated files from there to here, but ended up with insufficient information to meet our standards and verify copyrights on four out of five of the test files, and we thought that 80% was an unacceptable failure rate. Phab:T232480 addresses the development of this capability. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nRegardless, it wouldn't work. FileImporter is available on Commons and unless you do something here to restrict imports from other wikis, it wouldn't work. As I've said the button can easily be replicated. I suppose they could restrict files from importing from some wikis. That would mean, the FI would have to check the source wiki every time an user tries to import a file, check their user groups on that particular wiki, and then block/allow from importing accordingly. Too many steps here to do IMO. Just hiding that button from public view would not work. And as I've said, people would find alternative methods. Though the proposal below makes sense and should be implemented asap. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: It already checks for autoconfirmed (or local equivalent) on the source wiki. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\n@Jeff G.: Actually no. I do no have auto-confirmed rights on Arabic Wikipedia so I didn't see the \"Export to Wikimedia Commons\" button there but with my script I replicated the button. And guess what? I was able use to the import feature. For example, the Commons URL for importing this file from Arabic Wikipedia is this. And I could easily import it if I wanted (I didn't because the author field is missing). Care to guess what does this mean? This means that the Export to Wikimedia Commons button is only shown to auto-confirmed users on wikis. The FileImporter tool on Commons doesn't check for user rights on the source wiki. Only the button is hidden for non-autoconfirmed users. Any logged-in user can import files from other wikis even if they don't have auto-confirmed there. Masum Reza📞\n\nis currently done only with the related documentation. When no docu is generated, the module remains uncategorized - and can be encountered just accidently. Sandboxes of modules (and all modules containing a subname after a slash) cannot get a documentation, it's only possible for the main name. This situation is not at least satisfying. I suggest as a remedy the following:\n\nall module names ending with /sandbox are automatically categorized to Scribunto module sandboxes\n\nall other modules without a specified category are automatically default categorized to Scribunto modules uncategorized (or Scribunto modules without categorizing, or so)\n\nThe latter one may serve somehow also as a maintenance category – but at least it will contain all the modules not visible in the other categories. This will make easier the navigation in that namespace. -- sarang♥사랑\n\nI like the sandbox categorization idea, we have the same thing in template sandboxes. Combining it with SQL, this can also be useful to detect and delete old module sandboxes (though I don't recommend it because creating a sandbox version for a module with several submodules can sometimes take some time). I'm not sure about tagging every single uncategorized module with a maintenance category. Besides the technical challanges (I personally can't find a way to implement it), do we really need to categorise all modules? In some cases, it can be very useful, but we don't even categorise all templates. Nonetheless, you can always create a module /doc subpage and only include some categories in it. Ahmadtalk\n\nThis should decrease a lot of backlogs, why do I need to ask an admin to delete a file that is uploaded by mistake?\n\nvotes\n\nSupport - What if you upload your private photos, wouldn't it be a good idea to delete that silently within seconds of upload, Instead of waiting for a sysop? -- Eatcha (talk)\n\n{{S}} Won't help backlogs all that much, but I can't think of any severe downside. Should likely be done by a bot, not by MediaWiki feature request. (feature request could follow if the bot gets used extensively) - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nOppose, at least \"for all users\". I just realized there's a theoretical legal issue here. If someone were to upload material that the WMF isn't allowed to have on their servers, it could go unnoticed when deleted shortly after upload. I'm not talking about copyvios, I'm talking about the stuff that will send you straight to jail which the WMF scrubs from their servers as soon as it's detected. Perhaps deletion of own uploads within 24 hours could be acceptable for autopatrollers, but absolutely not everyone. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSupport I like the idea - hopefully technically feasible. Rudolphous (talk)\n\nOppose I'm not sure there is big backlog for such cases. Let's keep the delete tools for the approved users. IMO a marginal benefit. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nOppose No. There is not a backlog of these cases and you open an enormous can of worms when you take into account overwrites. If you have an image you want to delete and it is within the normal bounds of G7 tag it {{G7}}. It is literally that easy. If you need something deleted quicker because of personal information in it you didn't want, tell no one publicly and email oversight. This is a solution looking for a problem and will do nothing to actually help a nonexistant backlog. --Majora (talk)\n\nWeak Oppose, I have often see some users nominate their own files for deletion because they don't want their image to be released under a free license despite irrevocably releasing it under one. While I certainly think that wrongly uploading something private is an issue, sysops can still view deleted files so it's not a mistake we can truly fix today. I am just afraid that this will enable too much deletion of otherwise high quality uploads at the whim of the uploader. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nI do not think this is a problem. According to present rules, user can request deletion up to a week after upload without any explanation: this is a valid rationale for speedy and it is much longer period than the suggested 24 hours. Ankry (talk)\n\nOppose - My concern is that people will upload their files and then change their mind.... Licences are irrevocable but allowing this would provide a loophole meaning people could revoke the licence under \"I uploaded it by mistake\". –Davey2010Talk\n\nWe would generally respect a deletion request of \"changed my mind\" within 24 hours (or should). Very recent uploads are treated differently than ones that have been here for a long time. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI agree they are and I've endorsed deletion on a few of those .... however we've always gone by once the file is uploaded it cannot and will not be deleted, Not all uploader requests have been fulfilled, Reading the comments below I don't know if it is legally binding but I've always assumed it is. –Davey2010Talk\n\nThe speedy deletion guideline is to allow seven days. If someone made a mistake in the file they intended to license, let them fix it. But just not sure it's possible to give a full deletion right in that situation, so the current speedy process may have to be enough. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nOppose as it's unnecessary IMO. Such speedy/deletion requests are usually processed rapidly, if legitimate, as they don't require any discussion. Commons:Deletion requests/File:SharafkhanehPort00007.jpg was an exception, resulting from misunderstandings; I've deleted the image now. A problem is that we have contributors who, despite being active since years, think to have a right to delete their uploads, which had been on Commons for years, simply because they \"want to\". --Túrelio (talk)\n\nOppose I have requested speedy deletion for many thousands of deletions of my own uploads, which includes most often not using the standard speedy process/template and for files which may well have been hosted for much longer than a day. If anything we need to advise people a bit more openly on how courtesy deletions work, and perhaps spell out example scenarios in guidelines so that administrators make those choices more consistently and fairly. --Fæ (talk)\n\n@Eatcha: - None of these proposals are currently technically possible. The ability to delete pages is granted across the board by the delete flag. (See also Special:ListGroupRights.) There is no technical method of granting the ability to delete only certain pages or pages within a certain time frame, and this would have to be implemented from scratch. It is unlikely to be implemented even if we had a local consensus for it. If it somehow were implemented, the difficulty in doing so would almost certainly outweigh the marginal benefit. GMGtalk\n\nUser:GreenMeansGo It is possible, use an administrative bot, call that bot using a template to delete the file. What do you think ? --Eatcha (talk)\n\nThere is m:Synchbot to delete user pages, so I suppose this should be possible as well. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nYeah. That's doable. At the same time, Synchbot was created to implement a global software change already implemented by the Foundation. I'm not sure you're going to get a local admin bot approved for a comparatively small qualify of life change, that's probably only going to be rarely used anyway. GMGtalk\n\nSyncbot can delete user pages because it's operator has the \"global deleter\" right. Syncbot account doesn't do anything. Pathoschild is the one who deletes and edits userpages across Wikimedia projects. Masum Reza📞\n\n@GreenMeansGo: such a bot could actually simply handle G7 taggings for recently uploaded files, so one doesn't need to be aware of the existence of the bot. In addition it could check deletion requests to see if someone nominated their own file, and consider those as G7 requests as well. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Christian Ferrer: no big backlog, and let's say your assessment of this being a \"marginal benefit\" is correct. A marginal benefit is still a benefit, no? People sometimes select the wrong file, or realize minutes after uploading that this was a bad idea. And when an admin refuses a G7 because the file is 4 years old when it isn't, insists the file is 4 years old when asked even though it still isn't and another admin now refuses the G7 because some random editor inserted the image into an article on swwiki after the G7 was wrongly refused.. Yeah, I start hearing music. Admins are not flawless or the holy grail. \"keep the delete tools for the approved users\" is in itself not really an argument, that's tradition. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nG7 is for the unused content, and though I don't see me either why Ellin said it is 4 year old, a DR is fully appropriate for the content that is in use. We need approved users for the \"delete\" tool, we need users that are supposed to be familiar with our policies for this kind of tools. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nFurthermore, it is not because a speedy tag is possible that the administrators have to delete it inevitably, if they thing that there is a good reason to keep the file, or to discuss about the deletion. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nI think the cases where an uploader requests deletion of an unused file within 24 hours that shouldn't be deleted are really quite sparse. Oh, and that file was unused both when the DR was started and when I tagged the file for G7. It only became used after that. We can't allow random editors to sabotage G7 requests like that. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Majora: I agree this shouldn't be done to help with any backlog. I also agree a bot should ignore files that were overwritten, or even ones that are linked from other files. But tagging {{G7}} is not \"that easy\". You have to know about that. (which newbies never do) What about a bot that checks DRs and appends G7 where appropriate? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI'd be much more amenable to that. When I'm closing old DRs I take into consideration if the {{Delete}} tag was applied during the normal seven day window. If the file is not in use I almost always courtesy delete the file such as this example. A bot to do that tagging I would probably support. --Majora (talk)\n\n@Donald Trung and Davey2010: I think legally the Creative Commons license may not be enforceable if someone changes their mind within 24 hours. At least on Commons. We don't ask uploaders to sign anything, we don't ask for confirmation. It is possible to upload the wrong file by accident, or upload a file without realizing you're releasing it under a free license, or what a free license even means. This could vary from country to country, probably even from judge to judge. But a contract is generally not valid unless all parties can be reasonably assumed to have understood its terms. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nNo, it is enforceable per CC FAQ. CC licenses are irrevocable. \"I changed my mind\" doesn't work here. Masum Reza📞\n\n@Masumrezarock100: CC license may not yet be valid at that point. This is no case of revoking a CC license (which, indeed, is not possible) but a case of the CC license having never been valid to begin with. The UploadWizard doesn't inform uploaders sufficiently and confirm they understood the terms sufficiently to be able to instantly turn an upload into a binding contract. This will vary from country to country. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nTell that to the Terms & Conditions that accompany all apps, websites, etc. that nobody reads or understands but are definitely legally binding. Ignorance of the legal ramifications of what you are doing does not indemnify you to those consequences. --Majora (talk)\n\nIs there no difference between those for profit companies and us. If no, why are we here ? Instead of volunteering for Apple or Ford. WMF must not become one of those companies. I'm asking for a single day, not even a week. -- Eatcha (talk)\n\n@Majora: Actually it can in some cases. At least in the EU. In the US Terms & Conditions are not always enforceable either. And in the UploadWizard, we don't even have a button that says \"I release this work under a free license\" or even \"I accept\", no.. we have \"Next\", which is legally nonsense. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI was thinking of the \"clickwrap\" types which the US link you mentioned pretty much states are legally enforceable. While I am not a lawyer and therefore this is not legal advice, the UploadWizard has a notification that you are releasing it under <insert license here> with a link to the full legal code. You have to acknowledge that you are agreeing to this action by clicking the \"Next\" button (which by the way is stored at MediaWiki:Mwe-upwiz-next and therefore could always be changed). Not as good as \"I agree\" but I would imagine these would fall under a clickwrap type scenario if someone would really decide to sue someone else over a reuse of a CC release image that they had deleted 12 hours later. --Majora (talk)\n\n@Majora: That, and there is one more difference. Terms & Conditions usually contain ordinary stuff. \"We use Google statistics, we store cookies on your computer, underwear can not be returned if the packaging has been opened, you give us a non-exclusive license to use photos you upload, if anything bad happens we are not responsible for nothing\" A user can expect such terms, they are generally reasonable. \"You will release your work to the general public under an irrevokable free license\" is not expected and quite possibly (from a legal point of view) not reasonable. (but I am also not a lawyer) The EU is probably more restrictive in this than the US. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nI already requested an edit filter to related to this backlog, Commons_talk:Abuse_filter/Archive_2018#Block_deletion_requests, but was rejected on technical basis.--BevinKacon (talk)\n\nComment Furthermore this kind of thing, in the case that it is technically possible, will potentially lead to a few other problems, e.g. some prolofic uploaders may be involved in conflicts with other members of the community and so then decides within an emotional \"diva-like\" behavior to delete all the upload they did in the past week. That is simply inacceptable as one of the pillars of the Wikimedia projetcs is that we don't really own the content that we add. The current situation at the discretion of the administrators, and in cases a little more complicated with formal DRs is quite good IMO. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\n@Christian Ferrer: one week is much longer than 24 hours, isn't it? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nYes indeed, but the principle stay the same. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nTrue, but impact of 24 hours is quite small. Regardless, I've changed my vote to oppose, albeit for different reasons. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nWhen translators who do not have autopatrol right translate things, their edits stay unpatrolled until a patroller marks them as patrolled. We have a different translation reviewing system, translation can be reviewed by those who have the translate-messagereview right. Currently any logged-in user can review translations. In addition to that, translations have to be approved by translation admins. So let's count the steps for reviewing an unautopatrolled translator's translations.\n\nReview by a patroller and marking the edits as patrolled\n\nReview by another translator (optional)\n\nand lastly acceptance by a translation admin.\n\nThis unnecessarily increases the backlog of unpatrolled edits. So if we can just omit the first step, we'll be able to reduce a lot of unpatrolled translations from the backlog. We have plenty of trusted translators here and their translations do not need to patrolled. Autopatrol might not be the best fit for users who are only here for translating things.\n\nFor example, this user Worrida (just a random example I found while patrolling). Their upload count is zero, and they are only here for translating pages and templates.\n\nSome links to recent changes and new pages backlog\n\nRTRC page with relevant filters (works only if you have enabled RTRC gadget)\n\nNewPages list with relevant filters\n\nProposals\n\nEither autopatrol translations as I said above\n\nOr create a new user group whose translations would be autopatrolled\n\nAutopatrol edits made with the translation tool or create a new group: votes\n\nSupport as proposer. I am fine with either way. Masum Reza📞\n\nOppose the translation tool can be used for the same vandalism like every page. And there is a huge backlog of unchecked translations. I think it would be better to give autopatrol rights to users doing more translation. --GPSLeo (talk)\n\nAutopatrol edits made with the translation tool or create a new group: discussion\n\nAre you sure about the last step: \"lastly acceptance by a translation admin\"? As far as I know, translations do not need to be accepted by a translation-admin. 4nn1l2 (talk)\n\nThanks for noticing. I've struck out those sentences. Masum Reza📞\n\n@GPSLeo: Autopatrol rights are given to trusted editors who understands our policies (including copyrignt policies). IMO there is no reason to assume that a user who is only here for translating things would also be familiar with our policies about copyrignts. But you do have a point. How about we just create a group called \"Translators\" or something? Their edits related to translation will be autopatrolled. Masum Reza📞\n\nI only want translations automatically marked as patrolled it the user is trusted. The texts are getting translated are often guidelines and other important pages. If I can not trust the user I want to patrol the edits or at least some and mark all manually as patrolled. Autopatrolled users do not have to understand every copyright rules for this we have the license reviewers. --GPSLeo (talk)\n\nNot case-sensitive. (UT: or ut: would both work) Ahmadtalk\n\nSupport Ahmadtalk\n\nOppose Normally, users should not visit (or even watch) other users' talk pages, because it most probably causes drama. No need to facilitate this. 4nn1l2 (talk)\n\n@4nn1l2: Yes, but someone who wants to visit someone else's talk page will most probably check it, whether with UT or without it. I think this can be useful mostly when you are busy doing something and you want to request help, ask questions etc from someone you know. I mean, can this, solely, become a problem (or at least, a somehow important part of the process that creates the problem)? Ahmadtalk\n\nWeak support UT isn't a valid 639-1 code currently, but it still might cause some confusion as two-letter codes usually go to Wikipedia, like de:Wikipedia and jp:ウィキペディア. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSupport -- Eatcha (talk)\n\nSupport, I can see how this is good for searching, probably less useful for linking itself, I can't see how this hurts and it's better to have something than need it and not have it. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nSupport useful. --大诺史 (Talk/留言/토론/Discussion)\n\nSupport. –Davey2010Talk\n\nOppose per Alexis, due to confusion - two-letter codes are usually interwiki links. ~riley (talk)\n\nYes, but for what language? I mean, is there a (somehow) strong possibility of confusion? Ahmadtalk\n\nIf a new language code appears, we may have problem. It is wise to avoid them. Ankry (talk)\n\nIn that case, maybe something like UTP could be a better idea. Ahmadtalk\n\nNow I'm thinking about network cable. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nMaybe we should just forget about it, I can't think of any better alias. Ahmadtalk\n\n@Ahmad252: I splitted this off to allow more votes to come in. If the next two votes support, UT: can be requested. If the next two oppose, there's no consensus. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nGood idea. We'll have a clear consensus then, and we will hopefully discuss on downsides more. Ahmadtalk\n\nOppose per Jarekt below. Multichill (talk)\n\nOppose Abbreviations tend to form a cryptic language readable only by experts. They can be a problem for new users if they are too many. --Geraki TG\n\nDiscussion\n\nAre the redirects automatic, or would they need manual creation? If they are automatic (e.g., TEM:Wikidata Infobox), then this seems reasonable, but if they need to be manually created then it sounds like it would be an unnecessary mess... Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\n@Mike Peel: They will be automatic. In fact, it isn't a \"redirect\", but another way to type the namespace's name (maybe we can call it an alias). It also works vice versa; you can type Commons:VPP instead of COM:VPP, there is no difference. Ahmadtalk\n\nThanks for the clarification. In that case, I'm neutral on these proposals. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nComment Proposal for UT split off from the proposals for TEM: and MOD:. (phab:T237177) - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nWhile WatchlistNotice has been used fairly actively until 2018 there were only 4 in 2019 and it's plenty of legacy code, including the now deprecated jquery.ui. As the system's importance is ceasing, I suggest de-registering the gadget, reverting the MediaWiki pages that transclude the messages into the Watchlist and the Community portals so the system doesn't bind JavaScript maintainer's resources. -- Rillke(q?)\n\n@Rillke: What's the downside/what will break? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nWell, I suggest to drop the possibility to broadcast messages through watchlist messages as described in Help:Watchlist messages. I expect nothing else to break. If itsn't dropped it probably won't break tomorrow, however a lot of this site's code needs a major overhaul and reducing features helps to focus. -- Rillke(q?)\n\n@Rillke: We still have the sitewide banner thingy, right? - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nYes, you will still have the site notice. Watchlist notice was introduced to have a more fine-grained, compact messaging system capable of handling many messages without becoming too annoying. However, as it isn't used, it fails its purpose. -- Rillke(q?)\n\nSupport Having a second notice system that works differently than the main one is quite confusing anyway. Sebari – aka Srittau (talk)\n\nSupport One notice system seems enough. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nQuestion @Rillke: I have no idea how all of this works technically: Would this somehow hamper the proposal for #Using MediaWiki:WatchlistNotice to neutrally advertise advance permission requests discussed below? --El Grafo (talk)\n\n@El Grafo: No, not really. Watchlist notices are built into the system by MediaWiki itself. You can't turn them off by disabling a gadget. The gadget in question certainly makes it easier to post watchlist messages but removing it won't affect the implementation of the other proposal. --Majora (talk)\n\nGoogle Ngrams.\n\nYou can do fun stuff with it, comparing word frequency like automobile vs car vs taxi and police car vs police automobile. And what's also really great about it: it's free!\n\nAvailable under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License to be exact. But Google being a for-profit company, they have no obligation to host these files forever. They could be available for a long time, or gone tomorrow.\n\nI'm not sure if this is strictly within our current scope. Educational, yes, totally, but COM:SCOPE isn't really clear about datasets like these. \"representative merely of raw text, e.g. ASCII files\" kind of suggests it falls outside of our current scope. But that line seems to have been written with text that should go into articles in mind, not gigabytes of tab separated data. Apparently we do have mw:Help:Tabular Data (I learned something today), but I'd also like to see the original files on Commons. (also I don't know if tabular data will even be suitable for this)\n\nThis will probably involve:\n\nDeclaring that at least for Google Ngrams, we are making an exception for COM:SCOPE.\n\nTemporarily enable .gz uploads for either bots, administrators or a particular user who will upload it.\n\nAdd storage.googleapis.com at least temporarily to wgCopyUploadsDomains.json for upload_by_url. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nBack up Google Ngrams: votes\n\nSupport - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\nSupport.--Vulphere\n\nSupport - Commons has more useless(Ngrams are not useless BTW) files than these, why shouldn't we host these ? -- Eatcha (talk)\n\nSupport, these Ngrams seem very useful, though not all of these are equally useful, it's better to save them now then regret it tomorrow. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nSupport - I'm sure people out there interested in this sort of thing will find these useful. –Davey2010Talk\n\nConditional support If this is generalised to \"Allow dataset uploads with prior community agreement\". Oppose If this is a Google-only exception. ℺ Gone Postal (〠 ✉ • ✍ ⏿)\n\nOppose - First off, these are mostly zipped and gzipped csv files. Shouldn't those go somewhere like CommonsArchive or Internet Archive rather than here? Second, Google is more than capable of backing up their own files and generally gives a year or two notice before discontinuing any services. What's the point of creating a 2nd (3rd?) back-up on Commons when there is no reason to believe that Google is discontinuing Ngrams any time soon? Surely, there are more productive uses of our time and space. Finally, hosting data files is out of scope for Commons. According to Commons:Project scope, \"Every file must be a media file.\" Kaldari (talk)\n\nSupport - Tibet Nation (talk)\n\nOppose I agree with Kaldari. Commons is for media files, backup is already existing in Internet Archive.--So9q (talk)\n\nOppose - I agree with Kaldari and am of the opinion that this is out of scope. The Internet Archive is a better place to host a backup of datasets like this. GFJ (talk)\n\nBack up Google Ngrams: discussion\n\nComment there already is a backup at https://archive.org/details/google_ngrams, what's wrong with that? This is really their territory, not ours … --El Grafo (talk)\n\n@El Grafo: Doesn't even include the 2012 dataset. But why shouldn't Commons and archive.org both retain a copy? There is no technical or copyright reason why we couldn't. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Alexis Jazz: alright, but I think Commonsarchive would be a much better place for this. --El Grafo (talk)\n\nWe'd need to buff up its storage space significantly (a few order of magnitudes probably?) to store this. --Zhuyifei1999 (talk)\n\n@Gone Postal: What's the difference? Prior community agreement will always be needed due to file formats. I guess you mean datasets should be added to COM:SCOPE? I agree with that, I'll create a proposal for that as well. Consider this proposal the finding of community agreement to upload Google Ngrams. - Alexis Jazz ping plz\n\n@Alexis Jazz: Ok, fair enough. I just want to be sure that if I were to spend lots of resources and collect a good dataset about word useage on forums, newsgroups (yes, they still exist), etc, then they would be treated in a similar manner to Google's. ℺ Gone Postal (〠 ✉ • ✍ ⏿)\n\n@Kaldari: El Grafo suggested CommonsArchive above. According to Zhuyifei1999, the storage space of CommonsArchive would have to be buffed up considerably. It only has 317 files at the moment and it is unofficial, so I wouldn't be surprised if CommonsArchive itself disappeared at some point. The Ngram files are in an open format, so there's no problem there. We just couldn't allow gzip for everyone because a gzip file can contain anything. As for Google backing it up themselves: we shouldn't rely on Google. Why import anything from anywhere? Others can take care of themselves right? And I'm not watching the Ngrams download page all the time. They could give a notice a year in advance and I would probably miss it. As for time, if someone runs a script to perform the upload (which shouldn't be exceptionally hard, I can provide a nice clean list of links if needed), I will take care of descriptions/categories/etc. - Alexis Jazz ping plz"
