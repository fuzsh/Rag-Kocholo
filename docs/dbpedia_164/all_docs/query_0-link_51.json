However, you should be absolutely and completely sure what you are reverting is vandalism (i.e. complete nonsense, pornography, etc.). If there is any chance that it is considered legitimate, you can be punished. Also, if a page is being hit by a large volume of malicious edits, you may want to let an admin know so that the page can be protected. —Keakealani\n\nIs there a magic word to show the table of contents in reverse order?

For example, when you type in \"Snoop Dog\" in the search, an article about Snoop Dog comes up, but my name, \"Vstyle\" won't even though I've created a page... What do I do?\n\nYou can type \"User:Vstyle\" in the search field, or you can click on your name on top of the screen while you're logged on if you want to access your user page. Equendil Talk\n\nWhat about when someone who is not a user wants to find me? and they want to easily see my page, how can someone find me without having to search the index? —Preceding unsigned comment added by Vstyle (talk • contribs) 01:07, 1 October 2006\n\nIf you Sign Your Posts, people can click on your name and go to your User Page. --After Midnight 0001\n\nThis is an encyclopedia, become famous and someone will write an entry about you. Wikipedia is not the right place for self promotion. Equendil Talk\n\nIt says on the upload page that images of magazine covers can be uploaded only to articles about the magazine. What about to the page of a short-story author, who has published primarily in that magazine (and whose name is on the cover in the image)? PaulLev\n\nUnder fair use, images of magazine covers can only be uploaded to articles about the magazine. In my opinion, uploading to the article about the author would not be fair use as you would be using an image copyrighted by the magazine on an article not about that magazine. However you would get a better expert opinion if you ask at the talk page of Wikipedia:Fair use 61.2.23.74\n\nThanks. I was thinking it over, and, given that the author's page prominently mentions the magazine - indeed, almost all of the author's stories are indicated as having been published in the magazine - a reasonable case could be made that the author's article is also an article about the magazine. So I put in the image for the time being - but also asked the question on the talk page of Wikipedia:Fair use, as you suggesged.PaulLev\n\nI'd say that's more illustrative than informational, which wouldn't be allowed by fair use policy. You don't need an image to show where they published. - Mgm|(talk)\n\nIs there a quick wiki-link to recently listed new third-party articles? Bardwell\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"third-party articles\", but you can view recent changes here —Keakealani\n\nAnd the newest pages are available at Special:Newpages. -- Rick Block (talk)\n\nThanks Rick, Just what I wanted!

What is that little person icon next to one's username in the upper-left corner of the page when logged in? --Gray PorpoisePhocoenidae, not Delphinidae\n\nI speculate it's just to help one realize that the links up there apply to you personally and your account, but I'm not sure... Maybe mine should be changed to a contemplative face now. Dar-Ape\n\nThanks. It would be neat to be able to change the icon in your preferences, or have special icons for administrators, bureaucrats, and normal users. --Gray PorpoisePhocoenidae, not Delphinidae\n\nI think that it only appears in the Monobook skin.

You can also place yourself in the category Wikipedian photographers by adding to your userpage this code: [[Category:Wikipedian photographers]]. The category Native American artists is not a user category, but classifies articles in the encyclopedia article space which are about Native American artists. In order to be added to that category, you would have to have an article posted about yourself. However, most people are not notable enough to be the subject of an article. Please see WP:BIO for our inclusion guideline criteria for articles on people. Note also that it is generally a bad idea to write an article about yourself. Please see WP:AUTO for more on this prohibition.

If its someone else's userpage, you may seek admin intervention at WP:ANI and request them to take action. 61.2.23.74\n\nSuch pages can probably be speedy deleted based on the attack page clause.

This includes an article describing the Neve DSP-1, which I have compiled from personal knowledge, documentation and interviews. There will be further articles dealing with the histories of other audio consoles and manufacturing companies.\n\nMy question is, would it be acceptable to insert a disambiguation page in Wikipedia with a link to the DSP-1 article in the IBS Wiki - and potentially to other future articles - or is it better Wiki practice to copy and paste my IBS article into Wikipedia?\n\nIt seems like a waste of web space to do so....\n\n--GOMJohn\n\nThe other wiki is not related to wikipedia and the content on wikipedia needs to be released under a free license such as GFDL. Hence its better to write a new article on the topic if it adheres to the Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines. But copy pasting is not a good idea as it may be a copyright violation which is not allowed on wikipedia. Also make sure that the article is not just an advert. 61.2.23.74\n\nHi, while editing articles relating to Turkey recently, I noticed that many Turkish editors communicate in Turkish on the articles' and their own talk pages. This means other editors cannot understand what they are discussing. Are these wiki-communities common? Is it appropriate for me to ask them to speak english, or are they entitled to communicate in the way they want? Any guidelines relating to this (I can't find a specific wiki-law)? Thanks for the info. Yandman\n\nIt is considered good wiki etiquette to converse in english on the english wikipedia. You can ask them to converse in english especially if they are discussing an article so that others can participate in the discussion too 61.2.23.74\n\nThey are certainly entitled to use Turkish on their own talk pages; on article talk pages, common sense should apply. If two Turkish speakers are trying to resolve an issue that has arisen between them, I don't see why they shouldn't use Turkish, but clearly if they want their arguments and conclusions to be taken into account by other users they would be better off using English.

Just today I came to check on it since I hadn't been notified of any activity on the subject only to find it missing. There is not even a deletion or edit log pertaining to the subject. It has been deleted/censored as if it'd never been there in the first place. I only get redirects to disambiguation pages. The topic was in line with the Wiki guidelines for posting and had been in use for months. It has now since disappeared. The links in my contributions page lead to disambiguation or not found pages. How do I revert back to when my page was not deleted? —Preceding unsigned comment added by User144233 (talk • contribs)\n\nSo, Special:Log doesn't show it at all?

User144233\n\nContributions to deleted articles are removed from 'your contribiutions list'. The article DJ Bartel has indeed been deleted. See Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DJ Bartel for a discussion on it. Garion96 (talk)\n\nI accidently deleted several questions on this page earlier today, which was pointed out to me just now. I've added them back, please make sure to check them, starting with section \"PLEASE READ\". Sorry about that. Equendil Talk\n\nIs Google considered a valid source? In the Freddie Mercury article there was a link to an article in CNN which is no longer there www.CNN.com. However, I Google'd it, found it and replaced the now dead link with this: [1]. It shows the CNN article in full. Is there a standard on this? Sparkhead\n\nGoogle itself is not a valid source, but a cache version of a now dead link like the one you described is perfectly fine as long as you provide the entire URL and don't just say source: \"google.com\" or \"google cache version\". - Mgm|(talk)\n\nGenerally, google cache links should only be used when they provide a HTML version of a PDF or other non-HTML format document. And note that yahoo search also provides cached pages, and often has ones that don't show up on google. Archive.org links are better used for pages that have gone away, as google cache links vanish for missing pages after a time. If you have further questions, please ask.

My guess is that it is too small in size (about 80 kB), so the thumbnail is considered \"unecessary\"? Either way, the height of the thumbnails show up as -1, and the image used is the full sized image.\n\nDoes anyone know the reason and a workaround? ☢ Ҡi∊ff⌇↯\n\nWell one workaround is you could manually resize the image with an image editor. Use that small image for the article and on the smaller image's page put a link to the full size version. It's not very elegant, but it will get the job done. —Mitaphane talk\n\nA couple of minutes ago, I logged in and made an edit to a talk page: [2]. The edit was recorded as having been made by an IP address - mine, I assume. When I then went to change the signature manually - without logging in, which didn't seem worthwhile as I was not planning to do any further editing - the edit was recorded with my username.\n\nWhy would this happen, and can it be fixed, as one of the benefits of logging in is meant to be that your IP address isn't recorded? If the edit is going to show as being made from an IP address, should you not be guaranteed to get the \"not logged in\" notice above the edit pane? Palmiro | Talk\n\nThis probably happened because you were logged out while editing. There could be a number of reasons for this such as having your cookies disabled or opening a new window. 61.2.23.73\n\nhow many sets of locks are there between the Ottawa River and The Falls at Hogs Back?\n\nI think you may want to ask this question at the Reference Desk.

It appearsthat it wason the cleanup list in January which is probably I can't go about changing it like a normal article.\n\nThank you matt\n\nYour contributions would be most welcome, and you are particularly encouraged to edit articles that someone has tagged with a cleanup tag. To edit any article just click the tab marked \"edit\" at the top of the page and make your changes in the editbox.

If you need helping finding a specific map or diagram (which are actually quite prevalent across Wikipedia), try asking with a more polite tone at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Humanities. McMillin24 contribstalk\n\nWe do have maps and diagrams, but if you don't tell us what kind you're looking for, it's hard to help. Also, you probably should've started looking a little earlier to avoid this situation. - Mgm|(talk)\n\nWhat exactly is the difference between a stub and a full article? Is it pretty much up to the writer to decide, or is their a minimum number of words for an article? Thanks S.dedalus\n\nThere is a great deal of overlap - but at least my definition of a stub is an article which doesn't cover the full scope that it could (and probably should). So, the number of words doesn't matter as much as the content and the article itself. Some articles just don't have a very broad basis of information, so a very short article might not be considered a stub. On the other hand, an article that covers a large subject (such as an entire country) needs to be quite fleshed out before I would consider it to be a fully-fledged article, even if it had more words than a smaller subject. But that's really just my opinion. —Keakealani\n\nYou might also find this helpful as a guidline. Generally, I consider a stub article to be at most a paragraph in length and not doing much more than giving a dictionary definition of what the subject. —Mitaphane talk\n\nI would consider the thing Mitaphane described a substub, and I would nominate anything that isn't more than a dic def for deletion. I think a stub is a relatively short article that misses key information to be optimally useful. - Mgm|(talk)\n\nWhat does the above do? Thanks.100110100\n\nIt removes the table of contents from the page it is written on. __TOC__ allows you to move the table of contents to a specific place in the article.

Andrew\n\nYou need to use the Upload file link in the menu to the left, but make sure you read the instructions on that page careful. A visit to Wikipedia:Image use policy and Wikipedia:Image copyright tags is also useful. The gallery button can only make galleries for already uploaded images, but use it sparsely.

The first article is The Hype about Hydrogen. I did not write this article, but the author of the book happens to be a friend of mine. When I first saw this article, it was not well written, and I tried to improve it. Also, I split the author's biographical information into a separate bio article and expanded that using information available on the internet. Today Potomacfever put the author's bio up for AfD. Potomacfever continues to make accusations about me, and any responses I give just prompt more discussion about issues that are not central to the articles.

They don't seem to have mentioned their reasoning anywhere else (I've checked Wikipedia:Articles for creation and their contribs around that time), and that IP also has vandalistic edits (but it may be dynamic/shared, so they may have been by different physical people); I think removing the AfD tag is the only practical option here, as there isn't any nomination reasoning.

Reasons given were lack of sources, though obscure data I created was left in, unsourced. Another was bad wording, but the whole entry was deleted instead of just grammatical correction.Data that was well known and sourced was deleted, though an important commentary on the spirit of the inhabitants.\n\nI am confused about this \"no non-sourced data\" thing... my family has lived on this island for many years. Being an island, there are VERY few websites that verify the things I've added. We're talking about data from our personal experience here, such as wildlife & nature, the unique geography, etc. But the external references are either non-existent online, or written so small as \"asides\" so as to not be worth citing.\n\nSo the only way to have my data NOT deleted on this wiki by this guy is to build my own website first, say the same exact things I typed into wiki last night, then link to it as some official \"source\"? PS... the deleter in question admits in his profile that he deletes alot... might be time to tone him down, as the data I and likely others add to this subject are HARD to find sources for, if even possible.\n\nIt's in our heads. Once we die, it's gone. And that's why I came to wiki. --JINZONINGEN 73\n\nWP:Verifiability, Wikipedia:Reliable sources and WP:NOT.

Other obscure data that likely only the islanders could verify was kept, no sources, while well documented info with sources, was. The deletion seems a bit nonsensical, or as he says in his profile, \"fun\".\n\nOh well, guess I'll have to scrape up some money so I can create my website, then be considered as a \"reliable source\" lol.\n\nX D --JINZONINGEN 73\n\nDiscuss it in the article's talk page, possibly? -- Consumed Crustacean (talk)\n\nEven that idea won't hold. Your website is highly unlikely to be considered a reliable source. Perhaps you should scour for some books, newspaper articles or government sources. I would start by referencing those asides you mentioned though, something is better than nothing. Consumed Crustacean is absolutely right about info being removed at any editor's discretion.

YoBub\n\nThere are various categories on Wikipedia that contain articles that can be improved; if you're interested in vastly improving articles, Category:Articles to be expanded will contain articles that need extra information; or look at Category:Stub categories, choose a sort of article you like to edit from the list, and try lengthening it from a stub to a full-length article. You may also want to look at Template:Opentasks for a short list of articles that need improvement, sorted by the sort of improvement needed. --ais523 16:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nYou say you couldn't edit the Armenia article but that's not totally true.

The user Topov has refused to engage with any other editors either on the article's talk page or on their own personal talk page; a message I left for him/her there was deleted by them.

I like some parts of the article (very vivid details). On the other hand it does tend to ignore some details (the Macready-Forrest dispute) and at least according to sources I cite, has some of the details wrong. I see my suggestions were ignored. Fair enough, but it does seem that something, if only the citations which you did ask for, might be included. Also the setting for the discussion. The Astor Place Riot was not some theatrical business, but a mark of the turbulent, immigrant, class-conscious moment which was to erupt more spectacularly in the Civil War Draft Riot.\n\nI append my suggestion: The Astor Place Theatre (opened 1847) was a focal point of Anglophile New York society. Patrons were required to wear kid gloves. There existed some rivalry between the English actor, William Macready, and the American actor, Edwin Forrest. Forrest had been hissed by an audience in London while playing Hamlet. He, in turn, hissed Macready at a performance in Edinburgh. On May 7, 1849, the aristocratic Macready was to appear at the Astor Place in Macbeth. The more coarse, populist Forrest was opening in a different play further downtown that same night. Two Americans set about to create a disturbance on the opening night. Isaiah Rynders, who was involved with the Five Points gangs (largely Irish, and thus, anti-English), and E. Judson , who wrote cheap novels under the name Ned Buntline, spread the message that this was an occasion to assert American pride. Although the police were armed and ready, backed by the militia, the crowd grew. Macready’s performance was disrupted, but did finish.

Can I edit the existing images on Wikipedia to make a new image? It is like combining some images into one. Probably I will need it for an Indonesian-related article. Cheers -- Imoeng\n\nWhat you can do is to download an image (via its image-description page; click on the image), edit it, and then upload it again; you can either upload it as a new image or overwrite an old one if it's an improved version. Be careful about licensing; it's simplest to use images which all have the same free licence to create the edited version, and upload the new image under the same licence, mentioning the original sources (using tags like {{GFDL-retouched}}; see Wikipedia:Image copyright tags). --ais523 13:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nThank you!

Some sample standards used by the community for this are in a list at Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards; it is extremely unlikely that you will become an administrator unless you have at least 2 months experience and 1500 constructive edits with the same username.

Two questions...one, how do you cite a video clip using the \"cite web\" template? I am wanting to do this because there is citable video media related to an article I want to edit. Two, am I legally allowed to cite it if it is on YouTube? I want to edit the article on the Immaculate Reception to reference a video clip of the play that was originally created by NBC Sports (which, for an article like this, is EXTREMELY necessary...plus it helps source a fact listed at the end of the article) and I'm somewhat unclear about whether using footage from there is a violation of copyright. I know a YouTube question was brought up a few questions ago, but I couldn't really tell from those guidelines whether this sort of video was allowed or not...even if it is, I still wouldn't mind knowing how to properly cite the darn thing. :) Thanks in advance. -- transaspie\n\n{{cite web}} on a video looks something like this:\n\n{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org|title=(its title)| accessdate=2006-10-04|author=(author)|format=ogg (or some other format)| publisher=(publisher)}}\n\nwhich produces (author). \"(its title)\" (ogg (or some other format)). (publisher) . . The 'format' field is the important one when citing a video, because it indicates it as a video. For information about which sources are reliable, see WP:RS. --ais523 08:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nThere's also a {{cite video}} template. Citing YouTube films can be okay as long as they don't clearly break copyright. If the video is available on the NBC Sports website, that one would be preferred, but seeing as they probably aren't trying to make money of it, the video would disappear if it wasn't on YouTube. Especially in cases were videos are otherwise impossible to track down, YouTube is a acceptable alternative. - Mgm|(talk)\n\nAs per item #5 of WP:EL#Links to be used occasionally:\n\nLinking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page is not violating copyright per contributors' rights and obligations. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States.\n\nOf course, as with all of Wikipedia's policies on copyright, it is better to leave it out than risk copyright infringement. And there have been previous incidents where CBS, the RIAA, and others have forced YouTube to take down videos because of copyvio. Zzyzx11 (Talk)\n\nBy the way, iirc, just because any copyrighted material is otherwise impossible to track down, or is out of print, does not negate the copyright laws. Reminds me of one of the reasons why the United States Supreme Court case Eldred v. Ashcroft started in the first place. Zzyzx11 (Talk)\n\nGood thing I asked about this then. Though it's a shame I can't use the video. Now I just to hope that I get REALLY, REALLY, REALLY (etc.), lucky and find a link to this where I can legitimately claim fair use for it.

Google does turn up \"only\" 500-some results for \"nose grease\", but if you do \"nose grease\" photography you get 900, and nose grease gives you completely different results (and a helluvalot more, many or most of which are actually relevant).

It's just a case of finding the right person to fix it. - Mgm|(talk)\n\nYeah, OK guys, but I didn't actually post to ask for help deciding whether or not to flag the article for deletion; I posted to ask if there's a place where the article can be listed to get help quicker than usual for cleanup tags (most of the articles I've added cleanup and sources tags to haven't gotten any help after months). Any ideas with that? Anchoress\n\nI doubt that there is, or it would simply become as full and backlogged as normal cleanup is. I was going to do a search on my University's subscribed databases, but my account is borked, and I'm not sure that I would find anything despite that. As it stands, I'm now thinking deletion might be the way unless someone comes up with some decent sources. Things can be undeleted if they come to that point anyways. -- Consumed Crustacean (talk)\n\nI hate to tag articles seen here at the help desk for deletion (speedy/PROD/AfD), since the new editors who ask about what is often their first article might perceive it as biting the newbies, but this isn't the case with this article (the person asking is not the author), and frankly, it's the kind of thing that should be deleted as soon as practical. It's not remotely an encyclopedic topic, is hopelessly unverifiable, and consists entirely of trivia, silly folklore, and college drinking humor. I typically share Mgm's optimism about cleanup, but unfortunately not in this case. --MCB\n\nJust a note: MCB has tagged it for deletion, which you can find here.

Thanks, --MCB\n\nI actually ran across this problem (or what i consider a problem, anyway) on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention page. The entire article appears to be copied directly from the CDC Web site... which i suppose is all fine and legal as far as intellectual property (since the CDC site is a government publication), but it does still kind of bother me. I was going to ask about it there until i saw a notice on the article's talk page saying that the article was derived 'in whole or part' from CDC material. Which, i don't know, i guess i assume means it's acceptable as far as Wikipedia policy is concerned.\n\nNow that it's been brought up again, though, it does bother me for a few reasons. Firstly, the notice belongs on the actual article page, not the talk page. A notice regarding the source of the content of the article is not 'discussion'. But i don't know, maybe that was decided on long before i ever looked up the topic.\n\nSecondly, i don't think it says anywhere what parts of the CDC Web site the majority of the text is taken from. There are a few references, but only to specific statements, not to the bulk of the article. (I assume each section is taken from a different page on the CDC site somewhere.)\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is... like DGG said, it doesn't really strike me as encyclopaedia material. What's the point of copying information about an organisation directly from that organisation's Web site (legal or not)? That's not an encyclopaedia article, that's not research, it's just copy-and-paste. The body of the article might as well just say 'hey, go to www.cdc.gov', because you'd get exactly the same information anyway.\n\nI dunno, maybe that's just me. And the CDC article is the only one i've noticed this issue with, so i couldn't speak for how wide-spread a problem it is.

Are people allowed to have a gallary like this on wikipedia? I highly doubt many of these pictures are actually used in any articles, so they're being uploaded and displayed purely as a collection. Are people allowed to have stuff like this on userpages? Furthermore, i have a sneaky suspicion that many of those pictures also violate copyright policies.\n\nAccording to that individual's talk page, they individual has had the gallary shut down before, and been told that it's not allowed.\n\nBesides being not allowed, pages like this really worry me. The page gets a huge number of views, (more than 3 thousand a day, according to these statistics). The reason i found the page was that i used the statistics tool i liked to above to see which user pages were getting the most views, just because i wanted to get an idea about what the most popular userpages are.\n\nAnd instead i get taken to a gallary of porn.\n\nNot to mention, the gallary is titled \"Work Gallary\". Purely misleading.\n\nIt's okay to have a gallery of images you uploaded, but fair use ones are not allowed in the userspace. Any copyright violations and fair use images can be deleted from the gallery. Any images he didn't upload himself can be too unless he changes the name as to not imply he took it. - 131.211.210.13\n\nThe page in question is indeed a bit off-colour, and IMO is getting a bit close to being obnoxious just to prove a point. The guidelines on user pages say that the stuff you have on your user page should be directly relevant to your work on Wikipedia, and in practice a small amount of personal stuff (eg some more information about yourself) is no problem. However, I don't see how this subpage can be in any way construed to being relevant to the user's work on Wikipedia. I randomly checked on some of his pictures and over three quarters of the ones I checked were only linked to his (and perhaps one or two other user's) subpages, and no articles.\n\nMy recommendation: first try and discuss this with the user in question. Leave a message on his talk page. Don't be confrontational, argue within the spirits of what Wikipedia is trying to accomplish. Point Images and media for deletion out (many (but not all!) of the images on his page will fall under these rules. Emphasise that this is not what Wikipedia is about, and that if he wants to create a pornography collection he is more than welcome to do this on his home computer or on his private website. You may wish to try a similar sort of thing with some of the other 'similar' pages to whom he links on his user page.\n\nIf your efforts fail, try to involve other users and get them to try and talk about this issue. Only if even that fails should you try a Request for Comment to see if you can get a consensus on the appropriateness of this kind of behaviour.\n\nHope this helps! — QuantumEleven\n\nPS Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts may also be a good place to try and get a quick outside opinion. — QuantumEleven\n\nI believe very much that something needs to be done about this \"Work Gallary\", but i don't wish to start an argument with this user. It's clear from his/her talk page that other Wikipedians, as well as admins it would seem, have had discussions with this user about it before. And if they haven't gotten anywhere, i doubt that person would listen to an anon. I will go post at Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts, which will hopefully bring this \"Work Gallary\" to the attention of someone who is able to help.\n\nSo i just now found the Main Page alternatives and more specifically the editable Main Page, which presumably allows me to customise the Main Page to my liking and force Wikipedia to show it in place of the 'official' one using the JavaScript at the bottom of that first page i linked to.\n\nAnd that's all cool and everything, but now i'm wondering if it's at all possible to do that with just the navigation bar (over there on the left-hand side of every page). I did some searching and i found like a proposal to change the 'official' navigation bar, and a discussion on how to change it if you have your own MediaWiki installation, but i can't seem to find a definitive answer as to whether a normal user like me can edit the navigation bar in the way that it seems i can edit the Main Page.\n\nIs this at all possible? Even with JavaScript or something? I don't want to do anything fancy, just add like an extra box full of links under the 'toolbox' section. ~ lav-chan @\n\nI created an article called \"Minkey (Mini Hockey)\" back at the beginning of July but I cannot get it returned on searches on \"minkey\" or \"mini hockey\". Is there some magic which must be done to trigger the article to be searchable? The word 'minkey' appears in the title, and in the text both with and without a capital ... I'm lost.\n\nSqueak(oz)\n\nI'm not like a hard-core expert, but no, there's nothing special you have to do to get the article to be searchable. My non-expert guess is that, for some reason (possibly technical difficulties?) the site hasn't indexed the entirety of your page yet, so searches that depend upon the body of the article won't return any results. The page on searching notes that sometimes there may be a delay in updating the search index. :shrug: ~ lav-chan @\n\nThe first entry on the Wikipedia Very Frequently Asked Questions is the answer you're looking for. The internal index that powers the search function is updated very slowly (because it's so enormous), so it may take weeks or months for your article to appear. As Lav-chan said, you don't need to do anything special, the article will be added, but you have to be patient... — QuantumEleven\n\nDear Wikipedia Staff,\n\nMy name is Daniele Melli and I work in the ETUC press and communication department (ref : http://www.etuc.org/a/129 ). I just have subscribed in order to update our page. I updated some data, but I could'nt put our \"new\" logo that you could find at this adress: http://www.etuc.org/spip/IMG/jpg/LOGO_PHRASE_1.jpg .\n\nCould you please help me to do that?\n\nThank you\n\nDaniele Melli\n\nDaniele Melli Press and Communication Department (removed other contact details to protect you from evil spammers)\n\nHello! In order to use your organisation's logo on Wikipedia you need to upload it. Make sure to read all the instructions on the upload page, and also take a look at Wikipedia:Logos for our policy on logos. Once you've uploaded it, you can edit the page on ETUC to use the new instead of the old logo.\n\nIf you have any other questions or are having difficulties with what I've described, don't hesitate to post here again! — QuantumEleven\n\nI'm the editor that uploaded the first ETUC logo, so I went ahead and updated it from the address you provided. I left a note on your talk page at User talk:Dmelli outlining the details. Cheers.--Bookandcoffee\n\nHello, I have just found this great site and seen an error on a fact so I trued to edit it and was told Im banned. I have never been to this site before and have read it may be a shared server or something and someone else has been naughty. What can i do? Thanks —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Engineer73 (talk • contribs) 10:52, October 5, 2006 (UTC).\n\nHi there! This happens if your ISP shares your IP address with other users (AOL is particularly notorious for doing this) - so every time you connect to the internet, your IP address will change, and you may end up with one that was previously used by a banned user. However, you have now managed to log in (as Engineer73), which means that this should no longer be a problem - all the edits you make while logged in will now only be attributed to you and no-one else. Try editing the page again, if you're still having problems, feel free to come back here and ask again.\n\nGood luck, and welcome to Wikipedia! — QuantumEleven\n\nWhich is the best way to deal with a possible hoax article? See Nicole Bennett. I cant find her or her albums on google or amazon or the record companys named. Also the history of the article is quite ridicoluos. Thank you!--VirtualDelight\n\nAs per WP:HOAX, the article should be marked with the {{hoax}} tag and then nominated for deletion. ~ lav-chan @\n\nHello, I would like to use Wikipedia in my Microsoft Word Research bar. Is there way possible to do this and if so how to do it? If you also have a link/instructions for OpenOffice.org that would be great.\n\nThanks Goedfinder\n\nDear Wikipedia,\n\nI would like to add a couple of external links, if possible, to the \"Paul Morphy\" page. I tried adding them without signing in, and then signing in, but they got deleted (presumably by an administrator) both times.\n\nI was hoping to add:\n\nBiography of Paul Morphy, his family and chess opponents Paul Morphy blog\n\nThe first site in particular has several pages all with good content that would be a useful addition to Wikipedia. Yes I am writing a book on Paul Morphy and the page serves to promote that somewhat, but no different from the other Paul Morphy external links.\n\nThe Blog link would allow people to post their own comments in a commmunity fashion and would be another external addition to Wikipedia knowledge.\n\nPlease can you let me know how to add these links?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMatt\n\nUnlikely to be an administrator. You should start by clicking the history link on the page. It will show you the comments from the person who deleted them (e.g. \"don't think link is relevant\", \"not in accordance with Wikipedia policies in Wikipedia:External links\" or \"evil spam! delete!\". Then if you disagree you could raise the point on the article's talk page. Please bear in mind that wikipedia is beseiged by spammers who see a great way to promote their stuff, and so people can be a bit trigger happy. Notinasnaid\n\nI thought there was some degree of protection used on whatever article was featured that day, (maybe I'm wrong), but there are malicious people with IP addresses only vandalising the Lord of the rings page, some of them pretty sneakily at that. Can someone protect it for the day or is it a job for the recent changes brigade? 149.155.96.6\n\nThe Main Page-featured article is traditionally left unprotected, to encourage people unfamiliar with Wikipedia to edit it. As well as RC patrollers, it's generally heavily watched by many users (including admins) just because it's on the Main Page, so vandalism to it tends to get reverted quickly. --ais523 13:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI just read the reasons on Raul's page as well, although it is nice to be able to edit straight away, it could also be offputting to people if they see the history detailing just how many times it has needed to be reverted. No need to reply.149.155.96.6\n\nI'm trying to get a unique user name. What I have right now looks like Mit kebes T , but that's a lot to type out. I wrote this under the signature section of my preference page, but when I add my signature it looks like this <span style=\"border:1px solid #808;padding:1px;\"><font color=\"silver\";background=\"black\";\">&nbsp;Mit&nbsp;</font><font color=\"black\";background=\"silver\";\">&nbsp;kebes&nbsp;</font><font color=\"silver\";background=\"black\";\">&nbsp; <font color=\"black\">T</font>&nbsp;</font></sup></span> . Wikipedia automatically adds a couple extra lines. I then tried changing my signature to raw link to prevent these lines from being added, but it said \"invalid HTML tags\". What do I do now? -Mit kebes\n\nYou may want to see WP:SIGHELP for advice. If you still can't get it to work, repost your question on its talk page. --ais523 14:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI posted on your talk page. I'll try to help, you can reply to me there if you like. ~ lav-chan @\n\nTwo questions 1. Is there any non-administrator tool that can be used to establish whether Wikipedia has links to a given site 2. What is the correct forum for making suggestions of additions to the \"blocked URLs\" list? Notinasnaid\n\nSpecial:Linksearch is available to all users. --ais523 15:06, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nm:Talk:Spam blacklist (on Meta). --ais523 15:06, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI clicked on a category tag for the article \"Harry Nkumbula\", but the subject's name didn't appear in the category it's supposed to appear in, which is named \"Zambian politicians\". How do I ensure that the article \"Harry Nkumbula\" appears in the category \"Zambian politicians\"?\n\nMungo\n\nThe article is in the category; it's just sorted under H rather than N. You can sort it to the right place by adding '|Nkumbula, Harry' inside the link to the category (just after the category's name). --ais523 15:19, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI keep being told to check my talkpage when I ask questions here, but no one has indicated where the heck I find it. I've done searches, searched the site, everything.\n\nWhere are these mysterious talkpages?\n\nThanks,\n\nD.S. —Preceding unsigned comment added by D.S. Cohen (talk • contribs)\n\nAcross the top of my Wikipedia page I see a list of things: my username, then \"my talk\", \"my preferences\" and so on. \"My talk\" is your talk page. Right now, there is nothing in it. Each article also has a talk page, which is the Discussion link on the second line. Notinasnaid\n\nWikipedia:Talk page might be helpful. —Keakealani\n\nI am trying to research the Politzer family and have been told that I can find some of the members here? True and if so how do I get there? Karin Politzer\n\nHave you tried Wikipedia's Reference Desk? They specialize in knowledge questions, and will try to answer any question in the universe (except how to use Wikipedia, since that's what this Help Desk is for). Just follow the link, select the relevant section, and ask away. I hope this helps. --ais523 16:32, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI tried to add a new website to the travel websites category but it appears that I can only edit an existing website listed ther rather than add a new one.\n\nHow do I add a \"new\" travel website to Wiki?\n\n-Mett\n\nYou cannot edit a category directly (at least not to add a new member to the category); instead, place a link of the form [[Category:CATEGORY NAME]] at the bottom of the article you wish to add (replacing CATEGORY NAME with the category's name, obviously :P ), and it will be added automatically. -- Ferkelparade π\n\nwhat would i have to do to plase an add please notify by email <email removed> or <email removed>\n\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean. You were trying to add another external link but were unable to? That doesn't seem possible - I can only assume that the page is protected or semi-protected and that you mistook being unable to change anything with being unable to add that link. At any rate, you should try to develop a clear reasoning for adding any external links; Wikipedia gets a lot of spam, so people are generally sceptical of additions by anonymous or new members. —Keakealani\n\nIf you were asking about placing an ad (as in advertisement), you would edit an article of your choice and place the text of your ad there. You would then see your edit instantly reverted, and a warning would appear on your talk page to please stop adding further ads, links to commercial sites, or whatever. If you persisted in adding ad"
