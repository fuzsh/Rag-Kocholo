I was looking at the head shots and I SWEAR it looks like Alan is sunburned in some of them! His face is pink and so is his neck and there is a line at his neck like where his shirt collar hit him. Wonder where he could have gotten sunburned??\n\nAlso, I've been seeing all of Alan's pics and of course seeing him myself. I was thinking that he might be more wrinkled or splotchy in person. But his skin looks GREAT. He is NOT wrinkled and he looked very smooth. But why is it that in his Snape garb his face looks so haggared and there are bags under his eyes and he seems \"jowly.\" Is it just the wig or the lighting?? Or has he put on some weight that has filled out his face some?? BTW, I thought his face did look fuller than I had seen in previous pictures. But again, I stress that he looked marvelous in every way! Any extra weight he may have is perfect on him.\n\nSnoKat\n\n4/30/07 at 10:29 AM\n\nComments:\n\nDamn. I KNOW that Steak N Shake well!!!

New York\n\nComments:\n\nThis is a review of \"Nobel Son\" from someone who was at the premiere. The site is www.zoom-in.com\n\nTribeca Film Festival\n\nA beautiful spring day in New York City and the Clearview Chelsea West Theater on West 23 rd was packed for the 2 p.m. screening for NOBEL SON, a tightly wound, fast paced, avant garde thriller with an equally thrilling film score that keeps the pulse racing at every twist and turn. Alan Rickman turns in a brilliant performance as the chemistry professor who wins the Nobel Prize and while accepting the award at Stockholm - his only son gets kidnapped. I had seen director Randall Miller's film MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL at another film festival and can now understand how he is able to extract and meld fine performances from such diverse and cross generational actors. It's easier said than done. Alan Rickman is such a class act and Miller keeps him totally in sync with the rest of the hipsters keeping him visually in outrageous rock and roll T-shirts underscoring his character's likewise outrageous ego. Mary Steenburgen was excellent in a well-developed mother character that's usually a downplayed and dismissive role. Nice to see her talents put into good use. There's even a clever car chase scene. Most of the actors were at the Q&A and the capacity crowd responded favorably with questions pertaining to the film's characters and as the director's father (a professor who had read the script before passing away) called it \"a preposterous storyline.\" Nevertheless, NOBEL SON was presented by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation so, it does have scientific merit in an eccentric way - but that's how these geniuses are, aren't they?\n\nCarolyn\n\n4/29/07 at 01:38 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

You know, I noticed that when I met him the other night, when I was up close, that he hadn't shaved. He had this grey/white stubble. I thought, well, it was a long day. But then I notice on the Today Show he looked stubbly then too! And in these pictures also! Is this his new look? Is he trying to grow a beard?

I know I am a minority and it's okay - and it usually works. But thank you so much for caring! Being a lucky girl, my hubby changed it into an .avi which worked better but not completely. So in the end, we realized that I could watch it without any problems at my hubby's PC. I should have tried that earlier... So, every problem solved.

I strongly assume it's because I don't use \"Windows Media Player\", as I am a Linux user.\n\nHowever, I am glad I could listen to the interview now and my hubby is trying to do something with that file to help me out... I hope it works... Otherwise YouTube will be my chance.\n\nConcerning the interview: I really, really don't like the rush of all those moderators, asking questions, not waiting for the answers, talking more than there guests. ARGH! And aren't there any other key words than Alan being a \"great villain\", playing in \"Die Hard\" and \"Harry Potter\"? As if he hadn't done so many great movies in between!\n\nAlSiPaRi\n\n4/28/07 at 03:28 PM\n\nComments:\n\nOhhh Claudia it,s so great. Tanks so much.\n\nWhat do you think?

It's unusual weather at the moment, the dryest April on record and temps today of 23.5C (74.3F) are very warm for April. The world's gone mad!\n\nClaudia, thanks for doing the Today tape. Shame they always bring up Snape, it would have been better to plug the Nobel Son premiere at Tribeca wouldn't it?

Well, I have you to thank for feeding my obsession so well! I remember when I downloaded that clip of Closetland from your site. It just stunned me. His performance is so amazing and so overlooked! Almost no one knows of this movie! That was why I chose it as my thing for him to autograph. I wondered if he might comment on it.

I wanted to let yall know that getting the Today show interview with AR up for everyone is my FIRST priority. I've been up since 6:30 this morning getting things sorted so I can work on it non-stop as soon as it airs (I can't remember a time that commercials have soooooo got on my nerves! LOL) Anyway, AR has been confirmed being there. They just announced that both SW and AR will be \"stopping\" by to talk about their new movie and some of their other projects! I'm hoping Nobel Son and Sweeney Todd will be talked about.\n\nI will be working on it non-stop but due to the time it takes my programs to process, it will take a bit of time. If someone else get their video ready faster than I.....PLEASE post it as fast as you can. This isn't a competition.....all I'm interested in is getting it up for everyone to see.\n\nFor those of you that see the interview and want to post about it. Feel free to do so but please include a spoilers warning just in case some people want to see the video before reading about it.\n\nBe back in a bit, yall! Hugs to all!!!\n\nSophia\n\n4/28/07 at 07:47 AM\n\nComments:\n\nNo problem, Nadine!\n\nI just wondered what happened and couldn't get a clue...

Keep checking back for a few days because I did get some lovely shots.\n\nBut just to let you know how good he looked: My husband went along to get his first look at \"the old guy\" (as he usually refers to Alan).\n\nHis opinion: \"I'm secure enough in my manhood to admit that he's a pretty attractive guy.

I can't tell what was more interesting: seeing \"Equus\" or a real criminal trial at the Old Bailey. Anyway; I think I can put an end to the speculations about AR's participation in the Random Project.\n\nI went to see the the postcard exhibition last Saturday together with a friend. It took us a while to find the Homestead gallery; it's located in the basement of a clothes shop in a quiet part of the city. The gallery mainly consisted of empty space and two rickety tables where about eight very artsy looking people were working on their postcards. We were friendly welcomed and asked to draw a word from a jar. My friend immediately set to work on her card (her word was \"pub\") whereas I decided to draw my card (to the word \"free\") at the hotel and to have a look at the exhibition itself. When I browsed the guestbook I found the following entry on one of the first pages (click on the image to see a picture of the whole page):\n\nLooks suspiciously like AR's handwriting, doesn't it...?\n\nI finished my postcard over the weekend and took it back to the gallery on Monday afternoon. The clothes shop was open, but the basement was completely deserted. At first I felt stupid standing all alone inside the gallery, but then I decided to use the situation to my advantage and to take a closer look at the ominous \"Noise\" postcard. The back side turned out to be especially revealing:\n\nBesides a nice little autograph of our favourite actor it also contained what appeares to be Melanie Parker's private (?!) address (which I won't give to anybody, so please don't ask). I wonder what I should make of that...?\n\nAnd yes, I put the card back on the wall again, even though the temptation was almost overwhelming. After that I rewarded myself for my honesty with a big slice of chocolate cake from Pret a Manger...\n\nalanrickmanfrek\n\n4/27/07 at 07:21 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

He is erudite, not prone to or particularly tolerant of Americanisms, and visibly tired of fielding Harry Potter questions if polite when that subject, or any other, comes up. He is droll, but regally so, free of the aw-shucksisms that American actors affect, which renders him less immediately accessible and infinitely more authentic. He is also ridiculously, nay, ridonkulously attractive, even more so than on screen. Ah, starf***ery.\n\nJuliet\n\n4/27/07 at 04:57 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

Their owners\n\nhad left them as they left\n\nthe burning city.\n\nThe trash-heaps became\n\na battlefield where the lapdogs lost\n\nto an army of strays, lean-limbed\n\nand mangy with hate.\n\nCowering and cleansed, the back-alley refugees\n\nretreated to the doorways\n\nof locked apartments, barking in answer\n\nto each unearthly whistle\n\nas the morning shells came in.\n\none of those locked apartments\n\nwhere we kicked down the door, searching\n\nfor a bastard sniper and found\n\nthe skeleton of an old woman fused\n\nto a kitchen chair, yes, merged with the wood.\n\nShe had starved to death\n\nsitting next to a pantry crammed with cans of food.\n\nWe spent a long time debating the crucial issue\n\nof her religion. Yackety-yack. We could get no clue\n\nfrom the photos that littered the place,\n\nor the needlepoint of a knight\n\nand castle, or the hundred\n\nbottles of perfume placed around her bed.\n\nHer piously folded hands remained a secret.\n\nIt was dawn before the argument died out\n\nand we carried her into the street where dogs\n\nwere fighting amid the garbage--\n\nnothing they wouldn't risk,\n\nnothing they wouldn't eat. Who cares,\n\nanyway? Who knows\n\nwhether she even believed in God? 'By God,\n\nGod will find his hands full\n\nafter this war,\" someone said, and we fell\n\nsilent, pretending not to see\n\nher silly grin, and the sudden silver glint\n\nof the can-opener on its chain\n\naround her neck.\n\nBeginning After Everything\n\nAfter I buried my mother\n\nunder fire, I sprinted from the graveyard\n\nafter the soldiers came with my brother\n\nwrapped in a tarp\n\nI gave them back his gun\n\nafter the fire in the eyes of my children\n\nas they ran to the cellar\n\nthe rats ran ahead of them\n\nafter I wiped the old woman's face\n\nwith a dishtowel\n\nterrified to reveal a face I knew\n\nafter the ravenous dog\n\nfeasting on blood\n\njust another corpse in snipers' alley\n\nafter everything\n\nI wanted to write poems like newspaper reports,\n\nso heartless, so cold,\n\nthat I could forget them, forget them\n\nin the same moment that someone might ask me,\n\n'Why do you write poems like newspaper reports?'\n\nChristmas\n\n'I'm blind,' I say. I don't speak again\n\nfor a very long time. Of course,\n\nI'm lying about being blind: if I look\n\nout of the window, to where\n\nthe children are singing carols, I see\n\nhow the snow seems to fetch a rainbow;\n\nI see frozen songbirds fall\n\nfrom the branches; I see a butcher haul\n\na slaughtered lamb down the street.\n\nIt is night. An icon burns in the stove.\n\nThere's a seamless drone from the airport\n\nthat makes me want to weep.\n\n'I am blind,' I say, 'I am blind.'\n\nShe doesn't say a word. She beats\n\nthe Devil's tattoo on the tabletop.\n\n'I've forgotten,' I whisper. I don't speak again\n\nfor a very long time. Of course,\n\nI'm lying about having forgotten: I think back\n\nto hoofprints in the snow and dogs on a leash.\n\nIt was a manhunt. I remember my father laughed\n\nwhen I barked at the birds.\n\n'Have you ever noticed how a vacuum-cleaner sounds\n\nlike a plane in take-off, or how\n\na TV left on too long will fix a room\n\nwith a hot and heavy smell? Have you noticed\n\nthe depth of frost?' I ask her.\n\n'Have you noticed this incredible frost at all?'\n\nShe's got nothing to say for herself.\n\nShe might not have heard.\n\nI won't speak again. I'll sit here and watch\n\nthe traffic lights adapting endlessly\n\nto whatever's best. That's me, I'm just like that.\n\nA whole universe buzzed above\n\nthe control tower: isn't that strange?\n\nFish in the depths are strange--the way they live.\n\nThe smell of hay in an orchard\n\nis too strange for words. Now and then,\n\nsomeone winks from the bottle:\n\nthe genie, the Puck of plum brandy.\n\n'Can you see me?' I ask. 'Can you see me any jot\n\nof me, any tittle?' She nods, but of course\n\nshe's lying. As if I cared, as if\n\nshe could understand the half of what I say.\n\nSarajevo Spring\n\nIt is spring again. The spring is coming.\n\nIt is coming in\n\non crutches. Swallows nest in the ruins.\n\nSomeone has strung a clothes-line\n\nin the graveyard\n\nand a hundred diapers semaphore the wind.\n\nPeace surprised us: we needed more time\n\nto pretend we deserved it, more time\n\nto be 'the survivors',\n\nas if we had plans, as if we knew\n\nwhat next, as if\n\nour dreams were not all of seagulls and the sea.\n\nPeace is like a virus, a light fever.\n\nPeace makes our Sunday suits\n\nrestless; it makes our shoes shuffle.\n\nSoldiers wander the streets legless on slivovitz\n\nasking, 'What next? What next?'\n\nThey won't go home\n\nto collect their demob papers, they won't\n\nhand in their uniforms;\n\nwell, what did you expect?\n\nThey needed more time, more time\n\nlike the boy we carred feet first from the movie-house,\n\nwiped out by a happy ending.\n\nlike our neighbors, who've clean forgotten\n\nhow to keep a good row going;\n\nlike our local hero, a four-hundred-metre man,\n\nwho sits all day by the running track\n\nin his wheelchair\n\nas if it might suddenly come to him: what next.\n\nSoon it will be medals and flags, a coat of whitewash\n\nfor the orphanage walls. The children carry\n\nfamily albums with them\n\nwherever they go. My friend carries\n\na child's winter glove. I think\n\nhe needs more time for this, more time, I think\n\npeace has made us less than ourselves, and spring\n\nis coming hobble-\n\nclop, hobble-clop, hobble-clop.\n\nBtw, my postcard is now being exhibited in London (the random project sent me a photo) hahaha in certain sense together with his OMG OMG OMG\n\nsue\n\n4/26/07 at 12:26 PM\n\nComments:\n\nI can't find them online Marlina though there are a few quotes from one of them in a book review.\n\nMarlina\n\n4/26/07 at 11:06 AM\n\nComments:\n\nAnyone know where i can find the script of those Goran Simic poems?

Then I realized, as we passed him, that it was Alan Rickman. That explained it.\n\nI NEVER run into celebrities in the city - well, actually, I suppose I probably do, but I don't realize it's them. But there's really no mistaking Alan Rickman. He was giving off a glare which my brother, who lives in Hollywood, recognized immediately as the \"for the love of Gd, don't talk to me\" glare. Honestly, I'm not sure if he was glaring at us or if it was just a general glare and we sort of got caught in the tractor beam, but, man, when that dude glares at you, you stay glared at.\n\nHikity\n\n4/26/07 at 09:42 AM\n\nComments:\n\nAli-Pat, great philosopher, lol\n\nAli-Pat\n\n4/26/07 at 07:37 AM\n\nWhat is your location?

Virginia Beach, VA\n\nComments:\n\nSnoKat,\n\nI just got home from a Borders store and was looking at \"The Great Snape Debate\" book. They devote an entire chapter to AR's portrayal of Snape and also give a pretty good and very complimentary overview of AR's roles as good/bad guys. They even go all the way back to when he was in the RSC. I didn't buy the book but am thinking about it. There were no pictures of AR since the book is really about the \"book Snape\". They also had free bookmarks with \"Snape is Good\"/ \"Snape is Evil\" on either side and a list of reasons.

Here is the relevant piece from the letter.\n\nMr Rickman is currently in Chicago to attend the Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival where they are screening Perfume. Later in the week he will be attending Tribeca where Nobel Son is premiering on Saturday night. He will also be doing some press as Snow Cake is being released there on 27th April. As soon as he returns to the UK he will resume filming Sweeney Todd.\n\nThe Eagle has definitely landed!\n\nAlSiPaRi\n\n4/24/07 at 06:43 AM\n\nWhat is your location?

People apply for being in the show to bet that they can do something so very difficult, nobody can imagine. For example: identifying colors of crayons by tasting them with blindfolded eyes ... or identifying all songs of the Beatles by hearing only 1 or 2 seconds of any song ... YOU would be terrific in it with your quoting- I would bet on you for sure!\n\nrickimam: May I say my best wishes to for getting well soon! I daresay I can a bit of imagine what you are going through since I have some problems with my back myself. Fortunately I could avoid an operation up to now. I had (only) VERY painful inter dorsal cortisone injections and am now seeing a Chinese doctor for acupuncture since quite a while. That gives some abatement.

Canada\n\nComments:\n\nWelcome Angela ( official welcome to come from Claudia). You know, i was thinking the same thing. Why not more Snape, he is vital to the story..................then i realize thats our opinion because we really love Alan Rickman. Of course as fans we want more of him in the movie but i have to remember that its not Severus Snape and the Philosopher Stone or Severus Snape and the Chamber of Secrets and so on. This is Harry Potter's story and if you ask me there isnt enough Snape in the movies but as far as a non-Alan maniac like a few of my friends who are devoted Harry Potter fans they are ok with the amount of Snape in the movies. And they agree that at this point ( except for the occulmency lessons) that Snape is not as important as we Alan fans think he is...............that is until book six, even they agree that there is going to be more Snape/Alan time.\n\nWhen i think about it there wasnt enough Alan in Sense and Sensibility \" give me an occupation Miss Dahswood or I shall run mad\". or Micheal Collins \" I have only one thing to say and I want it to go out to the world\", or An Awfull Big Adventure \" dont you love me, just a bit\" or Bob Roberts \" excuse me, i must go pray\" or Judas Kiss \" Chief, the butler did it, im sorry it took me so long when the clues were so clear\" or Quigly \" are you certian Mr Quigly that you wouldnt like the bucket a little closer\" or January Man \" Just languish there darling, and dont molest anything\"...\n\nIn my opinion, there is not enough Alan in many movies.\n\nCarolyn\n\n4/21/07 at 07:21 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

I mean he is going to be in it but not more than the other movies.. I cant wait to see this movie and i for one am going to admit i am going to probably cry at the end of this one, Remus holdiing Harry back as he yells Sirius is heartwrenching..........\n\nBarbara\n\n4/21/07 at 04:49 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

I mean Snape should never be used as comic relief in these movies, he is a very bad man ( not evil ) but bad. ( i believe he is on the side of light). If we think he gets no time, i didnt even see McGonnagal on the discription of the trialer. It is going to have a couple really good things, like Remus holding Harry back after Sirius goes through the veil,,,,,,,,,,i cant wait till this movie comes out.I think i will be in Old Orchid Beach in Maine by then,i just hope they have a movie theatre......\n\nDoes anyone know yet when the NY premiere is?\n\nAli-Pat\n\n4/21/07 at 08:48 AM\n\nWhat is your location?

(It is now down to about a 10th of that.) I thought it would be a piece of cake with those names, says Raeburn, but no. I was told, Come back with Nicole Kidman and well talk.\n\nIMDB says in fact nothing about the actors involved now.\n\nHikity\n\n4/20/07 at 05:26 AM\n\nComments:\n\nCatsplay, I TOTALLY agree with Ispellit - you dig and dig and dig and find incredible, lovely, wonderful details\n\nIspellit, wow, nice pics , thanks a lot\n\nAlfan, from you latest post I assume your computer must be your alarm clock, with the GB opening the same moment it starts ringing, lol\n\nCyntilla\n\n4/19/07 at 05:20 PM\n\nWhat is your location?

I would even enjoy visiting GB and London at all, since I have been there once with school. (about 25 years ago) and liked it very much.

I had the same feeling when I discovered this wonderful GB here, and alas, 1.5 years later I met him twice . Apart from this I've met some of the nice ladies here in person, which I think, is even more valuable in the long run\n\nPhotos from your PC can be uploaded in the Caludia's photobucket - just give it a try\n\nIspellit\n\n4/19/07 at 02:12 AM\n\nWhat is your location?

I have seen most of those pictures except the last one, but i giggled at the last one, because he looks like he forgot his dentures ( i know he doesnt have them, just saying) or he just swollowed a lemon wedge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but its the only time i have seen him hold hands with Rima.\n\ndamn he is cute.\n\nAnd i agree with you Vicki, i would love to add those to my wonderfull collection of pics without the watermarks. And i also love the white pants,,,,,,,,,he does like his pants tight wich is a blessing for us....and according to a sales lady in Pittsburgh when he was filming Dogma \" he bought a pair of way to tight pants\".\n\nIspellit\n\n4/16/07 at 04:02 AM\n\nWhat is your location?
