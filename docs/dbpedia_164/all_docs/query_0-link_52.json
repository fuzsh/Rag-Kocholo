        "text": "Hello, the search engine doesn't know to associate characters with their diacritics. For example if your search word has an \"a\", it won't suggest the same word that contains \"á\" instead of \"a\".\n\nOn Romanian Wikipedia, when I search for Carol Popp de Szatmary it shows only 3 results, and it won't include the ro:Carol Popp de Szathmári article, which is almost the same with the text I was searching. You can check that for yourself: [1] or search Szatmary\n\nAnother example: search for „Agri” and the result doesn't include ro:Ağrı.\n\nI already reported the bug here: Help talk:Searching#Transliteration in searching - Help talk:Searching/Archive 4#Transliteration in searching. If the auto-suggest drop-down list doesn't know to make those associations - fine (even though 2013 sounds like a lot). But the search engine should definitely know how to make such associations, in my opinion. Thanks. — Ark25 (talk)\n\nWell, I made an error, I haven't noticed the extra \"h\" in the \"Szathmári\" word. However, the \"Ağrı\" example is valid. I think the search engine should associate \"ğ\" with \"g\". — Ark25 (talk)\n\nAs far as I can tell, the problem character in your other example is not ğ but ı (lower case dotless I). A search on agrı does find ro:Ağrı, but it doesn't find ro:Agri. The character is treated oddly. If it's the first character in a wikilink then it automatically works as i, for example in ı or ıce. If it's not the first character then it makes a redlink, for example kıte. If you enter ı in the search box and there is a title match with i instead of ı then it goes there, for example \"kıte\" goes to kite (with no redirect). But a search on kıte finds nothing. ı and i appear identical to the \"Go\" feature of the search box, but they aren't associated at all in searches. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nYou are right. Also it jumps directly if ı it's the last character: typing in the searchbox \"Ağri\" and pressing enter - will jump directly to Ağrı, just like in the ıce case (and I think it should not jump there, it should just show the article on the top of the search result list). But if you search for \"Ağri\" the Ağrı article will not show in the search result list. — Ark25 (talk)\n\nThat ıce = Ice = ice is undoubtedly due to the fact that the uppercase mapping of ı, as defined in the Unicode standard, is I.[2]—Emil J.\n\nIn fact, this probably also explains why “kıte” goes to kite from the search box: the “Go” feature appears to fold all letters to uppercase before attempting a match—if you type in “kItE”, it also goes to the same article.—Emil J.\n\nAh yes, {{uc:ı}} returns I, the normal upper case letter. This means that {{lc:{{uc:ı}}}} returns i, the normal lower case letter and not the one you started with. bugzilla:33643 is related. I don't know whether there is a bugzilla entry for i and ı not being associated in searches. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nI type:\n\nAbove section header ===AD=== Below section header\n\nAnd I see rendered:\n\nAbove section header\n\nAD\n\nBelow section header\n\nAD is the prefix of some old vacuum tubes. I can't jump there from the table of contents, either. I had to insert a blank between A and D as a workaround.\n\nIs that some misguided spam filter? --Mkratz (talk)\n\nOh, I just found out. It's the AdBlock Plus extension in Firefox. Lots of people have that installed. Now what? --Mkratz (talk)\n\nI don't have any problems seeing it with AdBlock enabled (though I usually have it disabled on en.wikipedia.org). It will surely depend on which filters you use in AdBlock. — HHHIPPO\n\nRight. Seems I've neglected to choose the filter, so AdBlock defaulted to FanBoy's. No problems anymore with EasyList.\n\nYet, I guess I better leave the workaround in place. --Mkratz (talk)\n\nIndeed, FanBoy's filter is blocking the word \"ad\". I wonder if that makes sense. How about this workaround: ===AD&nbsp;=== ? That looks basically the same, but tricks the filter. — HHHIPPO\n\nIs FanBoy contactable? Could he be asked to correct his filters to not cause the false match? – PartTimeGnome (talk | contribs)\n\nMight trick FanBoy, but there are lots of others. Better steer clear from the treshold. --Mkratz (talk)\n\nI'm trying to replicate the appearance of the Classic skin within Vector, and would appreciate some guidance in customizing my (already-heavily-modified) css and js files. I was getting some help on meta:Tech, but that seems to have dried up for now. Note that I didn't write these modifications; other people very generously wrote them for me. Current issues include:\n\nI'd like a \"my contributions\" link on all pages.\n\nI'd like a \"Watchlist\" link on all pages.\n\nI'd like a \"current version\" link on pages where I compare two diffs.\n\nI'd like the \"new messages\" notifier to be at the very top of the page, rather than at the top of the article. Note that I already have modifications to remove the orange bar, because the orange bar is hideously ugly.\n\nThe vertical separator bar is an ugly shade of light blue. I'd like it to be a pleasant gray (RGB: 128, 128, 128). I know how to change most of the font colors already (and am actively doing it because the colors that Vector uses are ugly), but not the separator bar colors.\n\nOn a related point, the vertical separator bar goes too far down. It should stop just past the first four lines of the article (or equivalent). And no horizontal separator bar at the very bottom of the page, thank you.\n\nThe relative font sizes of the various elements are wrong. Currently, the font size of article text is (X), but the font size of text in the edit window is (Y). I would like these to be inverted. I would also like the text in the sidebar to be (X) rather than (Y).\n\nI would like the sidebar to be somewhat narrower - like how it was in Classic.\n\nI would like to completely eliminate all use of the \"star\" icon as it pertains to the \"watch page\" function.\n\nThere's an unsightly empty space at the top of the page (see File:Classic vs heavily-modified Vector (skin comparison) 1.jpg, File:Classic vs heavily-modified Vector (skin comparison) 2.jpg, and File:Classic vs heavily-modified Vector (skin comparison) 3.jpg -- but it's present in unmodified Vector too, just smaller). I'd like it refilled with the links shown in the comparison jpgs.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice or suggestions you can provide. DS (talk)\n\nDevelopments since Google reneged on dropping H.264 two years ago, possibly due to acquiring Motorola patents:\n\nWikimedia rolls out TimedMediaHandler supporting H.264 transcoding\n\nWMF releases iPad app without Ogg or WebM support\n\nMozilla will support H.264 when the underlying platform supports it\n\nDebian 7.0 \"Wheezy\" will decode H.264 media out of the box\n\nNow that every modern platform supports it, so we're too late to pressure anyone into switching. So I suggest three transition phases: 1) Allow H.264 files masquerading as ogv/webm, 2) Allow uploading of H.264 and .mp4 extensions, 3) Enable transcoding to H.264. — Dispenser\n\nThis was never about pressuring anyone into switching. It's about Free and open information systems and not opening up ourselves to potential lawsuits by big techonlogy owners. Note that unlike for Mozilla for instance, we ARE part of those underlying systems (esp when it comes to transcoding), so there is quite a different risk assessment. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nMy post was to inform that all major platforms support H.264 video decoding, even Firefox on Debian the corner stop FOSS. H.264 is a \"free\" and open video codec, but patented (just like GIF). For the US, not even the oldest codec MPEG-1 (1992) is not patent free, and only more patent landmines have been laid. And even when Google purchases license from MPEG LA for everyone, it still doesn't the stop lawsuits. — Dispenser\n\nBeyond the issues with proprietary formats, allowing \"masqueraded\" mime types seems very unwise. I have categorized those to be converted (some already have been), and filed bugzilla:47709 about those even making it to the site. Finally, GIF has never been free and open. Superm401 - Talk\n\nHasn't GIF been \"free\" since the patents expired in 2006? Anomie⚔\n\nPer T49457 and the discussion above, I'm going to temporarily disable the WikiLove extension until the underlying issues with mw.loader are resolved. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you need to spread WikiLove in the meantime, please reacquaint yourself with Category:WikiLove templates :) Kaldari (talk)\n\nHa. Questionable timing, Kaldari--it's Friday, and who isn't in the mood for love on a Friday? I was just about to give it up to Wizardman. Drmies (talk)\n\nHopefully the WikiLove crisis will be over soon: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/61057/ Kaldari (talk)\n\nWhat do ya know. I haven't used WikiLove in ages. I was going to use it tonight, but I guess Wikipedia isn't feeling the love. MJ94 (talk)\n\nDear tech people:\n\nDoes Wikipedia have volunteer technical editors (for creating the scripts, tools, templates, etc.)? If so, where is the best place to inquire about becoming one of them? I have substantial, although somewhat outdated, experience in this area. —Anne Delong (talk)\n\nWhat do you need? mabdul\n\nI don't need anything in particular right now myself, I just enjoy coding, and wondered if this was a way I could help. If that's not allowed, just say so. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Anne Delong (talk • contribs)\n\nYes, there are ways for volunteer coders to contribute. The easiest (least sophisticated) way is through writing templates, which are just bits of specialized wikitext in the Template namespace. We also have Gadgets (written in Javascript), Modules (written in Lua), Skins (written with CSS). For more sophisticated programmers, one can also volunteer as a Mediawiki hacker (using PHP). With a bit more guidance about what you are looking for, perhaps we can point you in a more specific direction. Dragons flight (talk)\n\nIf you are able to edit the required page then you can just go ahead. Creating and editing templates, Lua modules or user scripts is like editing articles. There is no application process or official teams or leaders assigning tasks. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nWatchlisting this page would be a good start. People come here a lot to seek help from people such as yourself. Also, #mediawiki and #wikimedia-tech have lots of your types. :) Killiondude (talk)\n\nThank you. I would like to help out, but I know that errors can have more serious repercussions than when editing a regular text page. Are there standards and procedures essays that I should read before I make any changes? Or is everything usually located on the talk pages attached to the object? I am familiar with Javascript and PHP, but I would rather start out small. —Anne Delong (talk)\n\nThe page MediaWiki:Common.css/User:Paladox2014 exists (in that it's got an \"edit this page\" link not a \"create this page\" link), but it has no history. How can that happen? --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThe same thing happens for all subpages of MediaWiki:Common.css. Assuming it's just a placeholder built into mediawiki. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\n\"MediaWiki:Common.css/User:Paladox2014\" means the interface message \"common.css\" in the language with code \"User:Paladox2014\", just as \"MediaWiki:Common.css/de\" means the interface message \"common.css\" in German (code \"de\", from ISO 639). Of course, no language has code \"User:Paladox2014\", so it falls back to the default English message distributed with MediaWiki.\n\nSince the interface message \"common.css\" does exist in MediaWiki, the software displays an edit link rather than a create page link. Anomie⚔\n\nAs a little curio, non-existing languages cannot be chosen in preferences, but they can actually be chosen with uselang= in the url. For example, the page MediaWiki:Uploadtext/en-screenshot exists although \"en-screenshot\" is not intended as a language code. But if you replace http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload?uselang=en-screenshot then the software thinks you want to display Special:Upload in a language called en-screenshot, so you see MediaWiki:Uploadtext/en-screenshot. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nOK. Does anybody know why on earth Paladox2014 (talk · contribs) might need to create that page (see MediaWiki talk:Common.css/User:Paladox2014), or indeed what they're up to? The user account was created only yesterday, but from their edits so far (the very first was to create MediaWiki talk:Common.css/Wikipedia:Main Page/sandbox), I get the distinct impression that they want to jump right in with something hideously complicated - a redesign of the main page (without discussing it with others) is just one possibility. I might have formed entirely the wrong impression though. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nAt the page you linked above, xe said \"but how can I create for example Mediawiki:Common.css/User:Paladox2014/Main Page\"...which makes it look like this was a failed attempt at that. WP:CLUE could be an issue. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nHi. I've started a discussion at MediaWiki talk:Loginend#Future of this message about whether we want to continue including the \"Secure your account\" information on the login screen. Please discuss at the link provided. --MZMcBride (talk)\n\nI recently created a clickable image for the infobox in Paris using Extension:ImageMap. However, this has added a couple of extra lines around the image, so is there a way for the infobox to look like it does in this revision but still to be clickable?--Gilderien Chat|List of good deeds\n\nDone.[3] PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThank you very much :) --Gilderien Chat|List of good deeds\n\nDear editors: Last week I posted a proposal for an addition to the Afc submission process at my user page User:Anne Delong/AfcBox and asked the reviewers on the Afc talk page to respond at User talk:Anne Delong/AfcBox. After several of the reviewers showed interest, and with support from FoCuSandLeArN and some input from mabdul I asked for a technical assessment at Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals) and also at Village pump (technical).\n\nSince then there has been a lot of discussion on all three talk pages about various ways to improve the Afc submission process, but aside from TheDJ, who indicated that my proposal was technically feasible, and Ypnypn , who agreed that PHP shouldn't be needed, all of the discussion has centred around alternative and more complicated ideas using bots, javascript, etc. These are likely good ideas, but don't provide feedback on my original simpler proposal.\n\nPlease will someone let me know if this simple proposal (rather than the other alternative ideas) is worth pursuing, or what's wrong with it if not, by posting your opinions at User talk:Anne Delong/AfcBox. If no one likes the idea, and people instead want to go in a different direction, I will delete it. If people agree that the proposal has merit. Petrb has agreed to set it up. I am posting this on all three talk pages hoping to get a decision one way or the other. Thanks for your time. —Anne Delong (talk)\n\nI am looking to update the image displayed for the Portal:Coffee portal box (the box that's used in the See also sections of articles). I know that there's a page to update the image, but I just cannot find it at this time. I'm looking to update the generic portal puzzle image with File:A small cup of coffee.JPG. Northamerica1000(talk)\n\nSee Template:Portal#Image Nanonic (talk)\n\nResolved. Thanks very much Nanonic. Cheers, Northamerica1000(talk)\n\nHi all! About a week ago, the Wikipedia:Route diagram template (RDT) project pushed out two edit requests to modify two highly-visible templates:\n\nTemplate talk:BSpx; and\n\nTemplate talk:BS-overlap.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that these two requests were not addressed like other editrequests were, even after I wrote on WP:AN to ask to clear the backlog. May I know is there any special procedure to ask for large-scale modification to protected templates? Also can any administrator with the technical background to take a look on it? Thanks.\n\nThe background of this large-scale modification is at WT:RDT#Edit protected request 2013-04-17. — Peterwhy\n\nOh, I'm aware of it, just as I'm aware of all the other backlogged items at Category:Wikipedia protected edit requests, but I no longer touch anything that isn't 100% clear-cut cast-iron copper-bottomed uncontroversial; and in the case of templates (which these are) tested to destruction. This is because of the criticism that I have received when I fulfilled some requests that hadn't been discussed to death first. See also this discussion, if you have the patience. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nHi Redrose, thank you for your response. I agree the original discussion has been quite limited to within WT:RDT, so I would like to know, what we should actually do to gain wider acceptance to this modification? And to eventually get the modification done? — Peterwhy\n\nAdmins unfamiliar with what a template does or how it works shouldn't carry out a proposed change without being certain that the change is beneficial, especially when the template is highly-visible. So, at the very least, I (and probably others) would like to see some WP:TESTCASES which both prove that these changes do what they're supposed to do, and also demonstrate that existing usage is not compromised.\n\nI see that the proposed change to {{BSpx}} has been put into {{BSpx/sandbox}}, and that's great; but the proposed change to {{BS-overlap}} is not in {{BS-overlap/sandbox}}. Apparently it's in {{BS-overlap/sandbox2}} but that's more difficult to check since it doesn't have automatic links from the box at the bottom of Template:BS-overlap/doc nor from the {{editprotected}} box at Template talk:BS-overlap#Edit protected request 2013-04-19. The text after that states, rather vaguely, \"we will have to modify some more unprotected templates afterwards\" without detailing which ones nor in what way. I therefore cannot carry out any tests myself, which again means that testcases are needed.\n\nAs a frequent user of RDTs, I know what the overall suite is supposed to do, and for me there is one huge unanswered question: by changing the image size specifier from a height to a width, what will this do to those RDTs (such as this one) which use non-square icons? There are plenty of half-width icons such as (exdKHST-Ra); there are also some double-width icons such as (bvWSL-BS2+lr) (and even a few quarter-width icons like (cSTRq)); these have had a constant height because {{BSpx}} contains x20px and not 20px - testcases will go a long way toward showing that these still work. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nYes, I see I have to address your concerns before getting things changed.\n\nFor location of sandbox of {{BS-overlap}}, that is in {{BS-overlap/sandbox2}}. The second sandbox was created by User:Sameboat before I started to work on this batch of modification, probably from a good intent to avoid erasing the previous content. If you know any way to merge the edit log of sandbox2 back to {{BS-overlap/sandbox}}, please do help to move that.\n\nFor complete front to end test cases, please find them inside WT:RDT#Proposed changes to protected BS-overlap, BSpx. We have made some maps that uses {{BS-overlap/sandbox2}} and {{BSpx/sandbox}}. If you would like to create some tests, use the sandbox directory to find the sandboxes we used for testing.\n\n\"we will have to modify some more unprotected templates afterwards\": {{BSrow}}, {{BSrow-sc}}, {{BSrow-2}}, {{BSrow-replace}}, {{BSn}}, {{BSn-2}}, {{BSn-startCollapsible}}, {{BSn-replace}}. Again, these are the templates where sandboxes have been created to test for the new changes.\n\nDouble/half/quarter/3-quarter width: The transition should be smooth, except probably between {{BSpx}} and {{BS-overlap}} are updated and other templates (see above) are updated. Technically, we only move the x of x20px to {{BS-overlap/sandbox2}}. The aim is listed at WT:RDT#About PX parameter and Template:BSpx.\n\nLet me know if you have any other concerns. — Peterwhy\n\nAdditional note for the last point: we did not change \"the image specifier from a height to a width\", we change that from size to height. So this does not conflict with the original intention to add that x to {{BSpx}}. — Peterwhy\n\nRoute maps 3x faster by {BS-overlap} update: Today, at 09:12, 28 April 2013‎, the route-map formatter Template:BS-overlap was updated (for the first time in 3 years) to use quick icon-overlay by {Template:Superimpose5} and omit {BS-alt} which was setting alt-text for each pictogram. Those changes have allowed many route-map diagrams to reformat about 3x faster, such as former 12-second maps now 4 sec. Unfortunately, the update also dropped the image-links (to each pictogram image-description page), which is likely improper handling of artwork-attribution links. Anyway, that update allows testing to confirm how the route diagrams can be edit-previewed 3x times faster now, and further updates can be discussed at WT:Route_diagram_template. Part of the problem had the fully-protected {BS-overlap}, and so there were several pent-up improvements which were delayed during the past 3 years. I have created a spike-solution variation to allow fuller testing of the complex features, and to format the pictogram alt-text much faster. However, the image-attribution links probably need to be re-added soon in Template:BS-overlap. -Wikid77 (talk)\n\nUser:GregU seems to have become inactive, and I've discovered a bug in this widely-used script (it has been incorporated in AutoEd, and is a js gadget).\n\nThe bug is pretty simple: it will modify the dashes and hyphens in section headers, and this breaks any wikilinks from redirects or other articles that link directly to the section. All it takes to fix it is to place {{anchor|original section header}} as the first line in the modified header whenever the tool modifies a section header. That way, people that worry about the appearance of dashes vs. hyphens stay satisfied and the incoming wikilinks and redirects stay working.\n\nAnyone comfortable enough with Javascript editing of Wikipedia articles to take on the fix?—Kww(talk)\n\n/me points to User:Writ Keeper. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nHow about first asking the right question? We need to find out whether anybody has witnessed the breaking of such a link, or potentially how many articles the alleged \"problem\" would affect? -- Ohconfucius ping / poke\n\nThere are some other glitches that have already manifest as actual errors, as notified on the owner's talk page. -- Ohconfucius ping / poke\n\nStorm in a teacup, if you ask me, Kww. Tony (talk)\n\nNo one in the real world cares to force hyphens as dashes: Every so often we need people to come up for air, and learn that the world has stopped caring about the hyphen/dash issues. However, months ago someone had misled me into thinking the prestigious journal Nature had somehow advocated a style to use dashes between two-term expressions; however, after days of closer inspection, I discovered the truth is that Nature allowed the authors to use whichever dash/hyphen styles they preferred, even to mix hyphens and dashes in conflicting styles, such as page ranges \"2-5\" and \"2–6\" in the same peer-reviewed article. The 19th-century term \"hyphenated Americans\" states exactly what punctuation to use. Also, I learned, with the Michelson-Morley Experiment, even those two scientists spelled their Experiment with a hyphen (not a dash). Perhaps more confusing, the Adobe Reader will search with hyphen to match any dash or hyphen in the PDF-format text. Changing hyphens to dashes is just not as important as imagined some years ago, and has become viewed as balderdash. The world decided it did not care, and even hyphens have been removed from formerly hyphenated terms during the past 40 years. Spread the word down to the wiki-mines underground. -Wikid77 (talk)\n\nDue to the nature of this question, I believe that this is the correct forum for it. As an editor who did not become really involved in Wikipedia until 2012, but did look at Wikipedia from time to time from 2004 and onward, I thought I remembered seeing other name spaces on Wikipedia than the ones that exist today such as (article), Wikipedia:, Help:, MediaWiki:, Template:, etc. Essentially, I'm trying to build a proposal for a new namespace, but I want/need to make sure that what I'm trying to propose doesn't take the Wikipedia project backwards in time. So, does anyone have a list of any retired namespaces, or could someone either direct me to a page in Wikipedia where this list can be found? Steel1943 (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Namespace lists all of them, if I'm not mistaken. What exactly are you trying to propose? —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nThanks for that link Theopolisme, but that article only lists currently active namespaces; I'm looking for retired ones. And for your second question: basically, look at my user page for the answer to that one: I'm not trying to bring too much attention to that proposal since I have no idea yet if I would be taking steps backwards in the progress of this Wikipedia. Knowing about any retired name spaces could help with my latter concern. Steel1943 (talk)\n\nAn aside: I don't think that \"stepping backwards\" is always a bad thing. But in looking at your proposal and doing a bit of searching, I don't think that a specific Draft space has ever existed on Wikipedia. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nI am pretty confident that no namespaces have ever been \"retired\". — This, that and the other (talk)\n\nindeed, no namespaces have ever been discontinued here. Graham87\n\nWe have switched the default names for certain namespaces (\"image\" has mostly been switched to \"file\"), but the same namespace still exists (and the old names\\links still work).

Xaris333 (talk)\n\nSounds like something you might want to ask the Wikidata folks. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nDone! Xaris333 (talk)\n\nHi. Two or three days ago, the version of the Edit Tools that I get changed from the click-to-insert version depicted at MediaWiki:Edittools to the much more clunky copy-to-paste version. I haven't touched my preferences (and can't even see which preference would affect this). MSIE8 with active scripting enabled; Vector skin. Thanks for any help. --Stfg (talk)\n\nSounds like js in general might be failing somewhere - do other things still work, such as the search dropdown options, collapsible navigation, etc? -— Isarra ༆\n\n(edit conflict) what you describe is not what editTools supposed to do, and it's not what it does for me, so i think the problem is not general, but somehow specific to you. the first thing i'd do is try to see if it's related to your browser/computer or to your user account. the simplest way to test it is to log out, and try it again: edittools is on by default (too lazy to check, but i think it's a default gadget, rather than something added by Mediawiki:common.js ). if it has to do with your account, you probably want to go over your vector.js and common.js, and comment out one line at a time until you find the culprit, and discuss it with the owner of the imported script. if it happens when logged out also, please come back here and report - with as many details as you can (browser precise version, OS, which edittool is it that behaves this way, maybe even in which article did it happen, and any other detail you can think of). peace - קיפודנחש (aka kipod) (talk)\n\nSearch dropdown and collapsible navboxes work fine. Problem goes away when I log out. I've completely cleared my vector.js, common.js and, for good measure, vecrtor.css also (and remembered to clear the cache ) None of this removes the problem when logged in. By the way, I get the desired click-to-insert edit tool when editing these three files -- but only these three; editing anything else -- mainspace article, page in my user space, template -- still has the problem. I haven't done anything to my account for ages. I have Win XP (home) with SP3, fully patched. Browser version is MSIE 8.0.6001.18702. Thanks again for looking at this. --Stfg (talk)\n\nI've bypassed the problem by removing one of the scripts from my vector.js and have started a discussion with the designer. Please don't invest any more of your time in it, and thanks for the help so far. --Stfg (talk)\n\nIs there a way (a Special page similar to Special:ComparePages, perhaps) to see an automatically generated list of all the members of e.g. ( C a t e g o r y A ∨ C a t e g o r y B ) {\\displaystyle \\left(CategoryA\\lor CategoryB\\right)} , [ ( C a t e g o r y A ∧ C a t e g o r y B ) ∨ ( C a t e g o r y C ∧ ¬ C a t e g o r y D ) ] {\\displaystyle \\left[\\left(CategoryA\\land CategoryB\\right)\\lor \\left(CategoryC\\land \\neg CategoryD\\right)\\right]} , etc.? It Is Me Here t / c\n\nYep, Wikipedia:CatScan seems like exactly what you're looking for. —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nThank you It Is Me Here t / c\n\nI notice that the #if: function would trim line breaks from parameters 2 and 3, as shown above with User:Peterwhy/sandbox. I would like to know if this is an intended effect? Thanks. — Peterwhy\n\nIt's a known and long-established feature of the MediaWiki template parser that leading and trailing whitespace is significant around positional parameters, but not around named parameters. It's unlikely to change. Parser functions such as {{#if:}} strip surrounding whitespace from their output. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nUse the space-sensitive if-templates: There are some special templates which allow a space-sensitive result, with newline linebreaks, in conditional expressions. For example, using Template:ifeq or Template:ifexpr:\n\n\"{{ifeq|{{{it|xx}}}|xx| It is xx. }}\" → \"{{ifeq|{{{it|xx}}}|xx| It is xx. }}\"\n\n\"{{ifexpr|{{{| {{{age|19}}} >= 18}}} | Over 18 }}\" → \"{{ifexpr|{{{| {{{age|19}}} >= 18}}} | Over 18 }}\"\n\nThose templates are extremely fast, so could be used hundreds of times with no significant delay. When the data contains an equals sign (\"=\"), then pass the data inside a null-named parameter {{{|____}}}. -Wikid77 (talk)\n\nWikid77, please stop confusing the issue. There is no need for such complicated techniques; moreover, Peterwhy does not want to preserve the whitespace, because that breaks the image linking. What is needed is to trim the whitespace, and the construct that Peterwhy has already used (see the example that he began this thread with, also ), i.e. {{#if:1|{{{paramname|}}} }} works perfectly well, and since it uses a single parser function, which is built in to the MediaWiki software, is bound to be faster than any template-based alternative. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nToday on List of vegans, when I added a name to the sortable table and previewed, it wasn't formatted as a table, but as lines of text:\n\n|- !scope=\"row\" | John Salley |Retired professional basketball player, actor and talk show host |United States |[1][2][3] - !scope=\"row\" | Chad Ackerman |Singer, songwriter |United States |[4]\n\nBut when I saved, it was properly formatted. This problem only started today. It's happening repeatedly, with more than one browser, and with an account with different preferences. Can anyone think what the problem might be? SlimVirgin (talk)\n\nLet me guess... it began happening after you had saved . What you did there was to split the table into editable sections; as a result, when you edit any of the sections that occur after the start of the table, the table start code won't be present when you preview, but it will be there once saved. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI noticed it today at 17:42, 28 April 2013‎; I think it was okay after the sections were first added, but I'm not sure. We need the subsections because loading the whole table is very slow and hard to edit with; it also leads to edit conflicts. But we also need the code to be present on preview, because people will think they've messed it up and won't save. So it's not just a nuisance factor, it will stop people from editing. What can be done, do you think? SlimVirgin (talk)\n\nSplit into subarticles by alpha group: The only way to edit-preview part of a sortable table, with table headers, is to create transcluded sub-articles, where each page shows a part of the total list, but the overall list shows all subarticles transcluded together. For example, with letters A-F, create subarticle \"List of vegans A-F\" as if being a template, to allow edit-preview with table headers. Each subarticle page would be structured in the following manner:\n\n<noinclude> This is part of the '''[[List of vegans]], names A-F''' as a shorter section of the whole list. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\"|Name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35em;\"|Occupation ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6em;\"|Birthplace ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:5em;\"|Source </noinclude> |- person 1 |- person 2 <noinclude> |} ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:...]] </noinclude>\n\nThen, once separated into subarticles as the partial lists, each would be transcluded into the full \"List of vegans\" by treating each subarticle as if being a template file, trancluded by: {{List of vegans A-F}} in doubled curly braces. As the list grows, perhaps each subarticle would be sub-divided more, to span just 4 letters of the alphabet, rather than 6 letters A-F. So, plan now for how many letters in each subarticle. Note that each subarticle is truly a WP article (not a template), with lede paragraph and References, plus categories. However, that gives readers the option to view each subarticle if looking for vegans with names under just those letters. -Wikid77 (talk)\n\nThanks, Wikid. That sounds a bit complicated, and would it be confusing for new editors? I'm wondering whether it makes more sense just to have regular subsections (A-F, etc); that is, multiple tables. SlimVirgin (talk)\n\nAs a screen reader user, I'd prefer to just have multiple tables. The table does work with my screen reader JAWS, but it interprets the headings as part of the table header, meaning that I hear \"A–F\" along with the edit link when I navigate horizontally through the table; not a showstopper, but quite annoying. A big long table without headings shouldn't lead to edit conflicts, though, unless two users are trying to add people at the same point in the alphabet. Graham87\n\nPersonally I'd go with separate tables for each group, as we have done on pages like List of closed railway stations in Britain: D-F. But to return to the original matter; there is a simple technique, but it must be done carefully. When editing a section within the big long table, make your edit, and then go to the top of the edit window and insert one line immediately after the section header:\n\n{|\n\nand then go for Show preview Having verified the intended edit, make sure that you remove that {| before clicking Save page, because if you don't, you'll create a table-within-a-table, and almost certainly screw up the page formatting. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nIn general, adding more complexity in order to create a solution to a complex problem is often not the best idea. Go with separate lists. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nMany thanks to everyone for the input. Separate tables/sections seems to be the simplest solution. Thanks again.

PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nHi all,\n\nAfter many weeks of testing, We (the editor engagement experiments team) are is getting close to enabling redesigns of the account creation and login pages. (There's more background about how we got here and why ‎our blog post.)\n\nRight now are trying to identify any final bugs before we enable new defaults. This is where we really need your help: for now, we don't want to disrupt these critical functions if there are outstanding bugs or mistranslated interface messages. So for about a week, the new designs are opt-in only for testing purposes, and it would be wonderful if you could give them a try. Here's how:\n\nGo to account creation and add &useNew=1 to the URL, or just use this link\n\nGo to login and add &useNew=1 to the URL, or just use this link\n\nIf you have questions about how to test this or why something might be the way it is, I'd definitely check out our step-by-step testing guide and the general documentation.\n\nMany thanks, Steven Walling (WMF) • talk\n\nWill Special:PasswordReset be updated to reflect this new design as well? —Theopolisme (talk)\n\nNo, though if you think it should be, it should be simple enough. Steven Walling (WMF) • talk\n\nI've taken the liberty of making the test links protocol-relative (i.e. they go to the HTTPS site if the user is on the secure server, otherwise they go to the HTTP site). Graham87\n\nThanks Graham. One of the nicer parts of the new login form IMO is that it includes a default link to the HTTPS connection, if you're not already on it. Steven Walling (WMF) • talk\n\nThe gray text used for the form field labels (e.g. \"Username\", \"Password\") is too light: it is difficult to read, and moreover, it is not compliant with WCAG accessibility guidelines. Please consider darkening the text colour a bit. — This, that and the other (talk)\n\nAgree. How many times has this happened before ? Don't the designers have this on their checklist by now ? —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nThe lighter color is very much intentional, and in several rounds of usability tests (here's a few who gave us permission to share), we've seen pretty much all users be able to read fields contents with this color. It's explanatory content, and is thus lower priority than the actual field titles. Making all text the same style reduces usability for the majority of users. Steven Walling (WMF) • talk\n\nI don't object to using gray text, I think it looks good, but aren't you bothered by the rather low contrast level in terms of accessibility? It is absolutely crucial that our login form is as accessible to as many people as possible. — This, that and the other (talk)\n\nAnd how many people in that group of testers had a severe form of colorblindness ? Just because nobody in the testgroup complains about the lack of a level floor in a new building doesn't mean much until you bring someone with a wheelchair. I don't blame people for NOT taking this into account when testing. I didn't even notice myself until TtatO brought it up and usually i'm one of the first to complain about these issues. There are WCAG checklists for a reason, namely the fact that many of those points are hard to notice for people that don't have disabilities. That's why you build a checklist. Not to cross off every point like a machine, but to make your mind actively consider the step (Ask airline pilots). —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nActually, one of my team members is color blind. I agree we could consider readability enhancements, which are filed as bug 47777 if you'd like to add 2 cents there. Steven Walling (WMF) • talk\n\nIn general, like. I thought you guys were adding inline validation as well btw ? Or is that for a later phase ? If you take away the security advise etc from the interface, and don't give people tooltip advise, I'm sure some ppl will start wanting the headers with advice back. Also, slightly related: How about changing the \"email (optional)\" into \"email (advisable/recommended)\" ? —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nAlso, AFAICS, there is no opportunity to add extra footer text: see [5] and [6]. Obviously it looks a lot better without footer text, but sometimes there may be a need for the community to add various timely messages to this part of the screen. — This, that and the other (talk)\n\nI agree with \"Email (recommended)\" over (optional) as that would encourage people to provide their email address and they'd be able to get all the future benefits of Echo, Flow etc. Thehelpfulone\n\nTheDJ: yeah, we deferred inline validation until another release. We'll either refactor using the validation HTMLForm already provides, or rebuild the backend of the form on top of the API (which supports CAPTCHA delivery now, thanks to Brion). Regarding the email label: remember that most users don't expect email to be optional, it's actually kind of unusual compared to the other popular sites on the Web. If we want to recommend email strongly, we could consider doing something like adding a suggestion to provide it, if people skip the field before submitting (this would require client-side validation, of course). An interim compromise could be \"(Optional, but recommended)\" which is clear but slightly wordy. Thoughts?

The uploader informed me that he had sent a letter of permission to OTRS and sent me a copy of it, which looked sufficient, so I went to restore the image and tag it as OTRS pending.

Thanks in advance! --AKlapper (WMF) (talk)\n\nPeople were having the exact same problem with certain files about a year ago or so. If I remember correctly, the problem was that some files had wrong file access permissions on the servers where they were stored, with the result that the files couldn't be deleted, undeleted or moved.

I combined the left and right channels into mono, which helped lower the noise floor somewhat, and greatly increased the signal level, but I was unable to pull the voices out of the static. The big problem is that the noise is in the same frequency range as the voices. Anyway, the resulting file I have is uncompressed WAV audio with a size of 16.4 MB. Let me know if you want to hear it.

I am not sure which wikis are on s2 and s5, with the 14-hour replag. However, I have advised the enwiki Lua-cite editors (for wp:CS1 cites) to avoid changing Lua-cite Module:Citation/CS1, as reduced to perhaps once per week or once per 2 weeks, to stop reformatting the 2 million CS1-cite pages \"everyday\" as before. Meanwhile, the category links still tend to be slow to reset within enwiki itself, even after changing a template used in just a few articles, and must null-edit those few dependent articles to force category-link updates. Also, many of the other-language wikipedias have caught the epidemic navboxaholism, and so a change to their main navbox or infobox templates might cause zillions of cache pages to become out-of-sync and increase the replag. -Wikid77\n\nA new user pointed out that \"This question has to do with all plants on wikipedia that are hybrids, and therefore can contain a special symbol called a cross (×) as part of their binomial name. While it's correct to have the special character '×' in the binomial name of a hybrid, it's neither consistent across all plants on Wikipedia, nor is it terribly useful for users trying to find a certain plant when Wikipedia gives a 404 if I put an 'x' instead of an '×'.\"\n\nHis example was Rubus × loganobaccus with this special character (×) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_%C3%97_loganobaccus), which did not work with 'x' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_x_loganobaccus).\n\nThis has since been handled by redirect, but it is not so easy to redirect them all, because (surprise surprise!) searching for × in the standard form gets you \"An error has occurred while searching: The search backend returned an error:\" (without giving an error). It can actually go to × if you type it in the go/search box and hit enter, though.\n\nIs it possible to fix the search so that either:\n\na) any search with × that delivers either an error or no results is reattempted with x, and any search or URL with \"x\" delivering no results is reattempted with × (hmmm, that is a lot)\n\nor at least\n\nb) A search with × returns all article names containing it?\n\nWnt (talk)\n\nI've filed a request on bugzilla as T49881.

Or is there a way to make it work with IPv6? Shadowjams (talk)\n\nIf you look at the gadget source you can see that only /27 to /32 actually do a CIDR range lookups (the ucuser parameter is limited to 50 simultaneous values, so 2^(32-27) = 32 is the most that can be done at once). /24 and /16 are special cases that do a ucuserprefix search instead. These behave functionally the same as an asterisk suffixed; Eg: 1.2.3.4/16 == 1.2.*. For some reason, the mw:API can't do ucuserprefix on IPv6 addresses. Compare: Splark 92.12 2001:9d8:2005 (2001:9d8:2005:12::3 has edits). If it did, then simply using 2001:9d8:2005* should work. Possibly someone should open a WP:BUG (Product: MediaWiki. Component: API). --Splarka (rant)\n\nIt works if you use correct capitalization: 2001:9D8:2005 Anomie⚔\n\nInteresting. Requiring uppercase seems to violate RFC 5952 and \"The hexadecimal digits are case-insensitive, but IETF recommendations suggest the use of lower case letters.\" It even contradicts the format of the capitalization of IPv6 addresses in Recent Changes and article histories. Though it does agree with the API internal format (and IPv6 users' talk page titles). The API could possibly be modified to detect IPv6 fragments and ignore the case in a prefix search, as could the gadget, but neither solution is very elegant. --Splarka (rant)\n\nThe problem with that is how does it decide something is an \"IPv6 fragment\" rather than a username that happens to consist of numbers and letters a-f? Anomie⚔\n\nI contribute to eight language-specific Wikipedias (CY, DE, EN, ES, FR, GA, NL, SV), with accounts at each, mostly under different user names in each case.\n\nLately, after logging in to (at least) my CY, NL, and SV accounts I am also being logged in (without being asked, as far as I can see) into\n\nmeta.wikimedia.org\n\nwiktionary.org\n\nwikibooks.org\n\nwikiquote.org\n\nwikisource.org\n\ncommons.wikimedia.org\n\nwikinews.org\n\nwikiversity.org\n\nmediawiki.org\n\nwikidata.org\n\nspecies.wikimedia.org\n\nincubator.wikimedia.org\n\nwikivoyage.org\n\nThat might be harmless enough, I suppose, except that now whenever I switch from cy.wikipedia, nl.wikipedia, or sv.wikipedia to one of my other accounts I find myself logged in there under the name I used at the wikipedia I have just been visiting, and have to log out and in again under my \"real\" username for that language -- which is, to put it at its mildest, bloody annoying!\n\nCan anyone tell me, please, if this situation is reversible. I suspect there may be some connection between what is happening here and the \"global account\" concept (which, as I say, I have never knowingly signed up to). -- Picapica (talk)\n\nThis is one of the \"benefits\" brought by WP:SUL. My login was created after its introduction, so I'm used to the idea that I only need to log in once and I'm automatically logged in to all the others (although it does have its hiccups). Before we had Wikidata, it was a great boon when fixing interlanguage links (try some of the links at User:Redrose64#Non-English editing). But although I do very little on other Wikipedias now, it's still a benefit for editing on Commons, Meta and Wikidata. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThe only way to reverse this \"problem\" is to use one account. Whether that means you ask local bureaucrats to rename the account where it is not a part of the SUL, or abandon the old accounts, is up to you. I would personally just abandon the old accounts and ask for a bureaucrat or bureaucrat-analog to move the rights from old accounts to whichever you standardize on. --Izno (talk)\n\nAlso, this feature has been in place for a while.

Checking back, I see that I first got rid of it around four and a half years ago (see paragraphs below). I have a strong suspicion that its re-appearance could be connected to my use (for the first time) today of the relatively new \"Edit links\" feature for updating interwikis, which I did from the Dutch-language nlwiki.\n\nHere is a copy of a previous exchange on this subject from 2008. (I hope the solution offered there will work again!):\n\nI very much regret falling for the invitation to go for a unified login. I have Wikipedia accounts in eight languages, mostly with different usernames. Now when I switch between different language Wps I frequently have to log out and log in each time in order to use these accounts. I don't wish to rename these accounts even if I could (new accounts using my main, English-language name have been set up without my asking for them).\n\nIs there any way I can undo the unified login process so that I can be returned to the happy state I was in before I ever heard of unified login?

PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThose usernames are CY Jac-y-do, NL Torenkraai, SV Femten. It would make life a lot easier for me if none of these was a global account!\n\nDoes editing interwikis via the new procedure have anything at all to do with this?

There's simply no (permanent) fix for it other than using one account and one account only, or never editing Wikidata again, which is frankly not going to be an option when phase 2 is in full swing.... --Izno (talk)\n\nWhich is the whole reason behind unified global accounts to begin with. One person, one username across the entire set of projects. It's the ideal - no need to forget (or remember) other userid's.

And they'd have to log in that way - I'd think half the users affected are going to think they forgot their password.

If you are one of the few people who after a (in my opinion, grace period of) 6 years still didn't voluntarily created a global account, then now one will be created for you. If a global account with your name is no longer available, you will get a postfix attached to that global account and that is what you will have to use. There will only be one place for account renames. The talk page says, that they are looking at automatically redirecting users to their SUL account when they login with their old name and apparently people will be individually contacted as well. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nTo the OP: the weird thing is that it seems like whenever I enable scripts in Firefox (which I only do for Lua programming) I have to manually log in whenever I go to a page on a different project, despite having a SUL. But it works normally the 99% of the time when they're disabled. Wnt (talk)\n\nThat's because of how you are now protected by browsers from crossing domains with credentials. The technique we used over the past couple of years has actually stopped working in quite a few browsers (SUL2 is now being developed to properly solve this). The newest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox will only allow you to take your credentials to domains that you visited before. So if you regularly visit the sisterprojects, then it will work most of the time, if you don't then you might have to log in once in a while on a sisterproject. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nMy thanks for the replies and apologies for being slow to get back here to read them.

Could catch \"open-with-no-close\" in general, of which these are two examples. And also <s> and <center> and... DMacks (talk)\n\nHey all,\n\nHere is a copy of the regular (every fortnight) update for the VisualEditor project, so that you all know what is happening (and make sure you have as much opportunity to tell us when we're wrong, as well as help guide the priorities for development and improvement):\n\nVisualEditor was updated as part of the wider MediaWiki 1.22wmf3 branch deployment on Monday 29 April. In the two weeks since 1.22wmf2, the team have worked on deploying the VisualEditor opt-in alpha to more wikis, and on the new features for VisualEditor's wider launch as the default way users will edit our wikis: Categories, Templates, References and Images.\n\nFixed a number of bugs and regressions, including the 'bold' button not allowing you to un-bold some text (47680), fixing the link inspector throwing out \"undefined\" in some cases and other issues (47413), cleaning up the deployment including making the feedback link language-variable and having VE allow users preferences on non-deployed wikis (42936), avoiding a Firefox bug where shift-right caused characters to be deleted (47711), fixing a failure to let users convert between paragraphs and headings when next to an inline node (41203), and changing the integration so that the VisualEditor is now the editor behind the \"Edit\" tab (47396).\n\nAdditionally, we adjusted our code that faces mw:Parsoid to adapt to changes there and not fail when editing non-current pages (47434), fixed a problem of blank paragraphs getting inserted in some cases (46800), worked around a bug in jQuery that meant that references and other tags were getting corrupted (47417 and later 47737), avoided leaving trailing paragraphs when inserting content at the start or end of a paragraph (46799), made some speed improvements in the editing surface and the back-end (47343), and informed the user when a failure happens on serialisation (47581).\n\nIn experimental code that is not live on the Wikimedia servers yet, on images (37870) we added initial support for displaying and editing inline and thumbnail images, resizing of images, selection of images and other generated content with cursor keys (38129), and drag-and-drop relocation of images and other nodes. For references (39599) we added some infrastructure support for references. For templates (39598) we ensured that templates re-serialise to their original HTML if unchanged (47394).\n\nA complete list of individual code commits is available in the 1.22/wmf3 changelog, and all Bugzilla bugs closed in this period on Bugzilla's list.\n\nPer the MediaWiki deployment roadmap, this should be deployed here on Monday 6 May.\n\nHope this is helpful! As always, feedback gratefully received, either here or on the enwiki-specific feedback page.\n\nJdforrester (WMF) (talk)\n\nWhy is this being made a default instead of having two edit tabs side by side or a dropdown menu? – Allen4names (IPv6 contributions)\n\nThe idea is to have two edit tabs side by side at least for the short-to-medium-term as people get used to it, with \"Edit\" going to VisualEditor and \"Edit source\" to the wikitext editor - this second function will generally be more for \"power users\" and so it's appropriate for the longer, more precise and slightly 'scarier' labelling to apply to that one.\n\nIn the longer term, we imagine that the \"Edit source\" button will go \"below the fold\" on the Vector skin - i.e., to move to the drop-down menu - for pages where there will be VisualEditor available (which will not cover all of them - for example, the MediaWiki: namespace would be very hard to make work visually given that it's about editing fragments of wikitext, and the Template: namespace does the same to a smaller extent and, more importantly, includes a very large amount of highly-complex ParserFunction calls that would be a mess to edit.\n\nI hope this answers your question! Jdforrester (WMF) (talk)\n\nWill VisualEditor not have a button (like CodeEditor does) to toggle between \"visual\" and wikitext views? Although the CodeEditor button could use some UI love, it's not at all obvious that's what it does. Anomie⚔\n\nPotentially in the longer-term, as this requires a bunch of messiness in terms of juggling wikitext that isn't stored in the databases through the Parsoid service. It's do-able but not a priority. Jdforrester (WMF) (talk)\n\nPlease, please, please can we have an option somewhere to disable vised completely and to revert to the \"old\" raw edit mode for users who want to. I have tried vised, but I prefer \"the old ways\". Thanks.--ukexpat (talk)\n\nsecond. mabdul .\n\nYou will be able to use the \"Edit source\" button to edit in wikitext rather than using VisualEditor for the foreseeable future; I can't make an absolute guarantee, but there are certainly no plans to change it in the next few years. Jdforrester (WMF) (talk)\n\nAn idea just came to my mind. If a page not yet exists on the English Wikipedia, but the page exists in on Wikipedia in a foreign language, I think it will be great if there is link to that or those foreign Wikipedia page(s) somewhere while searching for the article. For instance; the page \"Edwin Evers\" don't exist on the en.wikipedia.org, but it exist on nl.wikipedia.org. I think it will be nice if there is a link to (in this case) the Dutch page or a link to the matching Wikidata page, on the search results page or on the non-existing page. Sander.v.Ginkel (talk)\n\nThis is follow-up to discussion at Template talk:No article text#Edit request 30 April 2013. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI agree, a link that performs the search on Wikidata at the top of the search results page would be helpful, especially for person articles. --JFH (talk)\n\nIs there an easy way to get the distribution of the number of references in articles? I need it for a rather minor point, but I can imagine that the data might be otherwise useful. In my specific case, I would like to know who many of the 4 million articles have four or fewer references. --SPhilbrick(Talk)\n\nI would ping database reports as my first stop for such a question. --Izno (talk)\n\nProbably better to scan a database dump looking for ref tags, I'd have thought. Or did you want to include bibliographies? - Jarry1250 [Vacation needed]\n\nIf you scan articles looking for <ref>...</ref> tags, you might not get articles like NBR 224 and 420 Classes, and you won't pick up Actuary at all. But neither of these is in any way unreferenced. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nYou might be interested that 1.9 million article have at least one Citation Style 1 template. Of course that leaves two million articles that either have included citations in some other way (e.g. manually, rarer templates, bare urls) or have no citations at all. Dragons flight (talk)\n\nI recently asked a similar question after finding the interesting list at Wikipedia:Articles with the most references (Wow! A lot of references per article... :-) I am looking for a stat/ report/ study about the growth of references in enWP in total, for the last year or something similar.\n\nOn german Wikipedia, users goiken and Svebert looked at the growth of \"<ref\" in article name space between 10. April 2011, 29. Oktober 2011 and 13. April 2012 (based on dumps, reported here: [9], [10], [11]). They found a growth of references of 36,4 % (from 2,6 to 3,6 million), while the number of german WP articles grew 13,5 %. The average number of references per article was 2,1 in 2011 and 2,5 in 2012.\n\nI found some very old stats from enWP of 2008/2009: User:Dr_pda/Article_referencing_statistics and User:WolterBot/Cleanup_statistics. \"the average number of citations per paragraph was 2.07 for FA, 2.06 for GA, 0.87 for A class, 0.51 for B, 0.26 for Start, 0.14 for Stub and 0.15 for Unassessed articles. This was out of a total of 2,251,862 articles (disambig pages and obvious lists excluded); 1,625,072 (72%) had no refs\" [12].\n\nIt would be great to have some recent stats! --Atlasowa (talk)\n\nThanks for all the information supplied. For my specific question, the answers suffice. However, given the critical nature that references play, I'm a little surprised we don't have more formal studies. Like Atlasowa, I'd be interested in more recent (and more complete) stats. --SPhilbrick(Talk)\n\nHi - input and ideas welcome for a new idea for category intersection:\n\nWikipedia_talk:Category_intersection#A_working_category_intersection_today\n\nThis leverages the catscan tool, but provides users an easy way to get to it. proposed as a sort of interim solution until wikidata is fully up and running, to tackle gender/ethnic divisions in our categorization tree. --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nin Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_table there is unwanted space between \"9.07\" and \"%\" - note that in other cells there is no space before percentage sign. It seems to be caused by overuse of autoformatting templates and I have no idea how to fix this (except converting this template orgy into proper table). Problem seems to not be browser dependent. 89.74.119.184 (talk)\n\nThe source simply had a space. I removed it.[13] Another place in the section said 9.07% without a space. Maybe you were looking at that. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nOps and thanks (I checked 9.07% without a space). Now I feel stupid 89.74.119.184 (talk)\n\nWe all make mistakes, and this one wouldn't crack my top ten :) --SPhilbrick(Talk)\n\nHi, I am have a difficult problem with templates (difficult for me that is) and am hoping someone here can help. I am using {{term}} and {{defn}} to structure this glossaary. I have created myself the templates {{subterm}} and {{subdefn}} which merely add some extra left margin and then call term and defn respectively. They both work fine. I have also created {{glossback}} to provide backlinks back to where the reader jumped from in the article. This also works fine. However, there is a strange problem that I can't solve when they are both used in the same glossary. After subdefn is used, every line that uses glossback subsequent to the subdefn call has a huge amount of whitespace inserted between the backlink and the term it is linked to. Please take a look. Thanks, SpinningSpark\n\nWhen {{{4|}}} etc. were not specified, a blank line was output. The easiest fix is to . --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThanks very much for fixing. But I don't understand why the glossary was not broken as well before the first call to subdefn. The entries using glossback were ok where the previous line called defn instead of subdefn. SpinningSpark\n\nPull up the mobile site en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page. You'll find that Adrian Boult is still the Featured Article, the Icelandic election is the top news story, and the ITN picture is still the unfortunate minaret (rather than the new King of the Netherlands). Why, and how can this be fixed? Lockesdonkey (talk)\n\nHow about now? I logged in on the mobile site and purged the page. Looks fine to me now. jcgoble3 (talk)\n\nI purged my whole cache. No dice. Also, this is happening on two devices in two browsers: one on a MacBook Pro running Chrome (OS: OS X Lion) and on an iPhone 4 running Safari (iOS 6.1.3). Lockesdonkey (talk)\n\nI can confirm that this problem exists for me viewing [14] in Firefox 23 on Windows 7, something I've never done. Definitely a server-side problem. — TORTOISEWRATH\n\nFirefox 20.0.1 on Windows 8 here, and after going back to the page now, it's back to the old version again. But if I log in, it shows me the current version. Sounds like bugzilla:44391 has now manifested itself on the mobile site (also see the discussion from the original version of this bug). jcgoble3 (talk)\n\nIndeed. — TORTOISEWRATH\n\nThanks for reporting this! The problem sounds like an issue in the MediaWiki server configuration. It would be nice if somebody who has this issue could send the software bug to the 'Bugzilla' bug tracker by following the instructions How to report a bug. This is to make developers of the software aware of the issue. If you have done so, please paste the number of the bug report (or the link) here, so others can also inform themselves about the bug's status. Thanks in advance! --AKlapper (WMF) (talk)\n\nReported as bugzilla:48062. — TORTOISEWRATH\n\nOn List of countries by GDP (PPP), I noticed that another reviewer had accepted a change that shouldn't have been accepted. I unaccepted the change and then rejected it myself. I want to notify the other reviewer of what I did and why, but the other reviewer's acceptance disappeared from the normal page history (after I unaccepted & rejected the change) and I can't find a record of the fact that the other reviewer touched the page at all. It doesn't show up in the other reviewer's contribs. Where can I find that record? Regards, Orange Suede Sofa (talk)\n\nUm. The Pending changes log is at (curiously) Special:Log/stable; input the article name in the \"Target (title or User:username for user):\" window, like this. However, I don't think that's what you're after. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nMy bad. I've updated the section title accordingly. What I'm after is an audit trail of the pending changes and their acceptances/rejections, so that I can find a complete record of the situation I described above. Regards, Orange Suede Sofa (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Worked it out. You want the \"Review log\", Special:Log/review. Near upper right of the article you should see a little box showing \"Accepted (latest)\" with a down arrow after it. Hover over that arrow and a further box appears; click the word \"accepted\". --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThat's exactly it. Thank you! Orange Suede Sofa (talk)\n\nAre there any tools that can be used to perform a full-text search for a string containing non-alphanumeric characters. Say, hypothetically, I wanted a list of all pages in mainspace containing the string !!. Doing this doesn't work, for understandable reasons; grep only searches page titles. This would be equivalent to the pseudo-SQL SELECT * FROM `pages` WHERE `namespace`=\"(Article)\" AND (`body` LIKE \"%!!%\" OR `title` LIKE \"%!!%\"), but performing direct SQL queries on the Wikimedia servers is something I predict only Jimbo is allowed to do. — TORTOISEWRATH\n\nThe only method I know of is to download your own copy of Wikipedia's text and then to scan it with the AWB Database scanner. Alternatively, drop a note on my talk page and I could run a search for you in my copy (a snapshot from 4th April). -- John of Reading (talk)\n\nCan someone help me figure out how to hide the BLP editnotice? As I edit pages using a magnified page view, it really takes up a disproportionate percentage of my screen. It should be possible to hide it using either CSS or JS (I think), but I can't quite figure out how to do either. Thanks! – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\nFor reference, the editnotice template is at Template:BLP editintro and is placed on the edit screen by MediaWiki:Common.js. – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\nYep, putting .editnotice_BLP_editintro{display:none;} into your CSS page should do the trick. Writ Keeper ⚇♔\n\nYour name seems to keep showing up on my userscript pages. Thanks again! – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you know where the message comes from - and you've already worked out that it's Template:BLP editintro - look inside that for a class=value that encompasses the whole message; in this case we have <div class=\"editnotice_BLP_editintro\">. The CSS to use is the name of the class, minus any quotes, preceded by a period and followed by {display:none;} which gives\n\n.editnotice_BLP_editintro{display:none;}\n\nSome messages have an id=value instead of a class=value and for these, the technique is almost the same, except that you begin with a hash # instead of a period . --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI look at the html source of the rendered page to find such things. That can also work when you don't know where it comes from. Indeed, the html source says <div class=\"editnotice_BLP_editintro\">. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nYeah, that's what I do (and did above). Right-click on it and select \"inspect element\" (if you're in Chrome; I use Firefox, so I get a similar thing through the Firebug extension). Writ Keeper ⚇♔\n\nI often use a magnified page view too. My User:Bgwhite/vector.css has options to remove alot of the \"distractions\" to give me more room. There are comments to say what each option does. I also use User:PleaseStand/hide-vector-sidebar.js in my vector.js file to remove the left sidebar. A tab option is placed at the top so you can access the sidebar when needed. Bgwhite (talk)\n\nThanks, everyone! I did find the class element, but wasn't sure what to do with it. Now I've got a (semi-permanent) reminder on my page in this script. Awesome!\n\n@BGwhite: I'll take a look at those, thanks for pointing them out! – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\n...and now my User:Philosopher/common.css and User:Philosopher/common.js are both longer and the 'pedia is more easily editable. – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\nFirefox has an inbuilt element inspector, which is IMO the best out there. Right-click and \"Inspect element\" or Alt+Q. — TORTOISEWRATH —Preceding undated comment added\n\nYeah, but in the change from v19 to v20 certain aspects of it were altered and sometimes it's more difficult to find what you want. The worst is that the pane on the lower left (where the \"source\" is displayed) sometimes doesn't show the line being inspected, but the very top of the page - the <html> tag, <head>...</head> element and <body> tag, followed by some <div>...</div>s. Other negative changes include the pane which shows how the styles were determined: it used to be full-height, now it's crammed into the corner and a lot of scrolling is needed. The only positive I've found so far is the \"box model\" tab.\n\nI didn't mention the \"inspect element\" feature before, because not all browsers have it, and for those that do, it varies widely. I perhaps should have mentioned \"View source\", since all major browsers have it; but it can be daunting for somebody unused to HTML. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI completely agree; I noticed these negative changes, too, but I forgot about them since v20 (I'm on the nightly channel, so it's been a few months for me since the change). I still think it's the best one available, just not as good as it used to be. It's a shame that nobody seems to have made an extension to get the v19 one back. — TORTOISEWRATH\n\nHello. In greek wikipedia we can enable (at preferences) to show items from Wikidata, under the title of a page. How can Ι enable this in english WP? I can't find it. Thx. Xaris333 (talk)\n\nYou can enable that by adding the following code to your common.js, or request to add the tool as an gadget. As far as I know, it is not enabled as an gadget on enwiki.\n\n// [[d:User:Yair rand/WikidataInfo.js]] importScriptURI(\"//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Yair rand/WikidataInfo.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript\");\n\n--Snaevar (talk)\n\nCouldn't do it. Can you help? My commons.js in my page. Xaris333 (talk)\n\nYes, I can help. The code needs to be at the bottom of your common.js file, below the bracket and semicolon - };, not above it like you did. So, the bottom of your common.js should look like so:\n\n'listOfUnavailablePagesOn':'List of not available pages on' }; // [[d:User:Yair rand/WikidataInfo.js]] importScriptURI(\"//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Yair rand/WikidataInfo.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript\");\n\n--Snaevar (talk)\n\nThx! Xaris333 (talk)\n\nHi - since switching to Vector recently, I've noticed there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the watch/unwatch tab at the top of the page. Sometimes it's written in text, sometimes as a filled or hollow star. It doesn't seem to be namespace specific, nor (as I first suspected) is it browser dependent (a lot of my browsing is done on a clapped out IE7 PC which I can't upgrade). Does everyone get this? Is there any reason for the inconsistency, and is there any css/js tweak I can do to make it appear the same way? An optimist on the run!\n\nIn your vector.js you have a script $('#ca-watch').removeClass('icon'); to remove the icon. However, it can only do this after the page has fully loaded, which can take a while. That explains the inconsistent result you are observing. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nI should have thought of that - thanks. An optimist on the run!\n\nI only get the star, never text.
