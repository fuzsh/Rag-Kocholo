        "text": "I've recently created this. I'm trying to get the photos just right, so I cropped the images of the XL-R and Z-R at the bottom of the page. However, now they appear \"stretched\" in the thumb, which is bad.\n\nI suspected the images would keep their aspect ratio after this change, appearing the same width in pixels, but being slightly taller. Is that understanding not correct?\n\nIn any event, suggestions? Maury Markowitz (talk)\n\nLooks fine to me -- maybe try refreshing your browser once or twice. Worst case, try a w:Wikipedia:Purge to make the HTML page re-generate. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nIndeed, all \"fixed\". Odd! Maury Markowitz (talk)\n\nFollowing on from #Proposed changes to PD tags above: I would like to propose a review of materials tagged {{PD-old}}, {{PD-old-70}}, etc. up to {{PD-old-100}} for works that may be in copyright in the U.S. because they were published 1923 or later and were in copyright in their country of first publication on the URAA date. Even in the case of PD-old-100 this is possible if the work was first published posthumously. To help organize this, I think it would be helpful to have a category Category:Files requiring U.S. copyright review listing all unreviewed files with these tags, similar to e.g. Category:Flickr review needed. All files that use {{PD-two}} or {{PD-Art-two}} would be excluded from review, as would any using the combined tags {{PD-old-70-1923}}, etc. All files that already include PD-US-*/PD-1923/PD-1996 tags could be reviewed automatically by a bot. A very (very) large backlog is expected, but that's okay. If you think this isn't the best way to proceed, I'd be interested in hearing alternative proposals for review.\n\nI tried to do this unilaterally before and made some pretty serious mistakes - I assure discussants that this time no action will be taken until the discussion is over and has been closed by a neutral party (and we have also heard from the WMF regarding the URAA). Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nOppose It would be nice to have information for every country for each file in a machine readable form. However, this proposal here is only for US. The proposed license tags are overly complicated (remember that uploaders even have problems to understand the meaning of \"70 years pma\" (which does not require more than 70 years after creation but after death) and nearly no-one will understand this system; especially if it uses some template parameters which need to be set. I saw the file pages you created in your last bot run (which you have reverted): much more than one screen page full of public domain (we are not talking of license templates with restrictions...) tags? Ugly and scaring away everybody who looks at (probably the reaction: they are crazy).\n\nIf you require non-US works to have a US-copyright clearance for being uploaded here that is a clear bias towards US (US-centrism) and we are no \"US Commons\". The reason that WMF is based in US is their problem, not ours. Your proposal: No, that is not Commons. So, in essence: we do not need that review which only helps US but not other countries and which leads in the end to more needless deletions of content copyrighted in the US (but PD in most other countries!) than without this review. Furthermore: why can't you just wait until at least the WMF has said a first word? --Saibo (Δ)\n\nA small note: I didn't actually add any tags to any files in my last run, only modified existing tags (there are files with lots of crazy PD tags out there, but they were already like that). Part of the reason the {{PD-old-70-1923}}, etc. tags were created (by User:Jusjih, I think?) is that they're much more compact than {{PD-old-70}}{{PD-1923}} or {{PD-two|PD-old-70|PD-1923}}. I agree about the cryptic template parameter - I think a simpler way to do it is to simply add the review category to the affected files, and remove it when done. User education is a difficult issue - we can't expect all uploaders to understand the intricacies of both the source country and US copyright. But in many cases {{PD-old-70-1923}} will apply, and in other cases I think a simple {{PD-old}} tag and a review category would be sufficient.\n\nI do want to hear from the WMF and just wanted to get this discussion started while we're waiting. The requirement that all works on Commons are free in the US is part of Commons:Licensing policy and the Licensing policy resolution passed by the Board of Trustees. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nIt don't see why you are in such a rush. If WMF sees it the same way as you see it (US-centrisic mass deletions of carefully uploaded and maintained public domain content and crazy copyright tag requirements) then they have simply failed their mission - okay, failure is nothing surprising for WMF. ;-) But maybe they surprise by choosing a decision according to their mission. --Saibo (Δ) +1 link 16:23, 22 January 2012 (UTC)\n\nI suppose it's insane to hope that we might one day be able to write {{Super Magic PD template|type|publication date|creation date|country of first publication|author death date}}, and the template spits out what applies?? (And a wizard/gadget with dropdowns which helps uploaders fill in the parameters?) Rd232 (talk)\n\nWell we have {{PD-old-auto}}, {{PD-old-auto-1923}}, and {{PD-art-auto}}, which is a start. Presumably if we had a template that allows you to specify important factors like the media type, death year of the author, year of first publication, and country of first publication, it could in many cases figure out whether it's PD or not and the appropriate reason. However, this doesn't address cases like {{PD-US-no notice}}, {{PD-US-not renewed}}; it may ask for information that isn't actually needed like the death date of author for US works pre 1923; and doesn't address cases where we don't precisely know all the information (e.g. perhaps we only know a range of dates, or have a guess, like saying an 1860 work is probably PD-old-70). I think a more viable strategy would be a \"PD wizard\" that asks you a bunch of questions until it figures out the right answer, then gives you the template(s) to paste in (or an explanation of why the file is not allowed). Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nYes, I was imagining a super-template plus wizard, but I suppose you could just put the \"super logic\" in the wizard and use simple(ish) templates. Downside, perhaps, might be maintainability, since Javascript expertise is more scarce than template expertise. Rd232 (talk)\n\nWhat's wrong with {{PD-old-100}}? If the author died 100 years ago, then their works were already in the PD in the source country in 1996, and were not restored by URAA. Trycatch (talk)\n\nIf the work was first published (posthumously after 1923) in both the source country and US simultaneously, and the work was registered and renewed, it could still be in copyright in the US (without the aid of the URAA). This doesn't seem unlikely for posthumous works of great commercial value. It will also matter in the future: starting in 2017, some Columbian works will be PD-old-100 which in 1996 were still under copyright in Columbia. In 2027 this will expand to most other countries (for works published 1932 or later). Better to start tagging sooner than have to sort it out later.\n\nI was going to say the work might have been first published in Mexico, but I just learned that Mexico was only life+75 in 1996. Maybe there are also other possibilities I'm not aware of. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nAny work, no matter where it was published, which managed to follow U.S. formalities could still be under copyright if published since 1923. Any unpublished work could still be under copyright, as well. Things created before 1978 but published from 1978 through 2002 will still have copyright until at least 2048, no matter when the author died. All of this is without the aid of the URAA. Also, starting in 2019, old published works will start expiring in the U.S. again; copyright on restored works won't last forever. By 2027, the line should be works published in 1931 and earlier. One note on Mexico -- they really weren't even life+75. The extension from 50 to 75 happened in 1994, but it wasn't retroactive (though did extend existing copyrights). And the 1982 extension from 30 to 50 pma was also not retroactive, meaning the line is (at most) authors who died in 1952 and later, and that only if the 1982 change extended existing copyrights (not sure on that one, just as I'm not sure if the 100 pma change altered existing copyright terms). Mexico also had a registration requirement for works published before January 14, 1948. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nSupport Copyright status in the US is relevant information about files and this information should be checked. Any categories, lists or templates that could help us to check it are welcome. A few reasons:\n\nWe can eventually be forced to delete or to move away files that are not free in the US, or even files not justified to be free in the US. Then, tagging the files that actually are free in the US wil help us to save those files and would ease the work of moving the other ones (if it is possible to move instead of deleting).\n\nWMF inability to host unfree files may be its problem, according to WMF views or according to US courts, but if WMF decides (or is forced to) solve its problem by deleting, it will be our problem. It will be our problem even if we are not concerned with WMF problems but concerned with our projects.\n\nAs Saibo noted, \" It would be nice to have information for every country for each file in a machine readable form.\" I support any serious proposal to tag copyright status in any other country, just as I support Dcoetzee's proposal for the US.\n\nWe can't expect all uploaders to be able to tell copyright status of every work in the US. In fact, a lot of uploaders just don't mind about copyright status. This is a good reason to organize files to be reviewed.\n\nI don't like complicated templates, but the facts license templates describe are complicated. Having double templates seems a good idea, since simpler templates can be used separately or complex double templates can be used more efficiently, leaving the choice to reviewers.--Pere prlpz (talk)\n\nGood points, well expressed. Rd232 (talk)\n\nSupport in principle, but how is it to be organised in practice? Perhaps this is another case for a Request for Comment, eg Commons:Requests for comment/reviewing PD tags. I would allow the scope to be a bit broader, because I echo Pere prlpz's point that as far as possible, we should try to be clear about copyright status in as many countries as possible. (I also think we could be clearer in COM:REUSE about what the implications are for reusers when copyright statuses are different in different countries.) Rd232 (talk)\n\nI'm still getting used to us having an RfC, that sounds appropriate :-) I would definitely be amenable to a plan that clarifies not only US copyright status (which is essential to whether we can host files) but also copyright status in other nations (which is essential to whether content reusers in those nations can reuse files). We have little notes for other countries in e.g. the {{PD-old-70}} tag, but that's about as far as things go at the moment. It would be neat if we had like, some kind of drop down list of countries that could give you info about a work's copyright status in any given nation. I think any review proposal should also include more information about effective prioritization, considering the enormous size of the backlog. For the RfC, do you think we should move this discussion there and revise it as we go, or start a new one based on the feedback received so far? Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nSome more thoughts: I think one way to get started on this would be to start documenting copyright-essential metadata about each PD image with a machine-readable template. Think something like enwp's persondata. It might look something like this (based on your super-template from before):\n\n{{copyright data |publication date= |creation date= |country of first publication= |author death date= |(possibly other fields) }}\n\nAny fields that aren't known would be left blank. With a template like this, it would be possible for a bot to reliably, automatically add appropriate license templates in many (but not all) cases, while putting other cases on manual review (just as we do for Flickr review). It would also facilitate tools (e.g. on Toolserver or using Javascript) to provide copyright status in many different countries and explanations, just by examining the machine-readable data and producing appropriate info for the desired country. The info could also potentially be useful for automatic categorization, and for other analyses. I am aware it would not cover all cases, e.g. {{PD-US-no notice}}, but those could still be described using tags as is currently done. Thoughts? Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nDcoetzee, majority of 452k mostly PD files using one of Category:Creator templates already have authors nationality and author death date, among other things. There are also 212k files transcribing little known tag template {{Works of authors who died more than 100 years ago}}. I think those templates can be used to quickly tag images which might not need an extensive review. It might be also a good idea to add creator templates to files being reviewed. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI think that's a potentially very fruitful avenue to explore. I'll just quickly point out that the persondata approach is not unique to en.wp: there are 10 interwiki links from de:Vorlage:Personendaten, the equivalent on de.wp [and 20 interwiki links from the en.wp template, in fact]. Jarekt points out overlap with Creator templates and others; I'm not sure if there's any elegant way to reuse that data; but duplication might be a price worth paying. Rd232 (talk)\n\nDunno. You would need type of work as well (and the variants between all the countries is pretty daunting). Government work vs corporate work vs personal work. If multiple authors, needs to be the last death date, but that may be OK. You could start with using Commons:Hirtle chart, File:Canadian Public Domain.svg, and a UK chart (non-Crown copyright only) for an idea of the questions you need to answer, and the data you need up front to answer it. It might be possible, at least for many situations, but it would probably be quite difficult. Some countries would definitely be easier than others. There actually is an online public domain calculator for many EU countries -- you could see many of the needed questions there as well. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nen:Wikipedia:Non-U.S._copyrights#Dates of restoration and terms of protection would be useful. Among the |(possibly other fields) you may consider adding |compliance with US formalities=yes/no/dontknow . To begin with, it would be good to start with a template working for one or two countries, and if it works, then try to add more countries, little by little. Teofilo (talk)\n\nStrong support for an autotemplate/metadata system (in theory, at least): it can start off with common permissions issues, and let itself be over ridable. Then, over time, the niches can be incorporated. I think it's the only long term solution to making copyright user friendly. Happy to help! Jarry1250 (talk)\n\nI have started writing an autotemplate for France (but I am far from being finished). To give you a taste, try the following\n\n{{copyright data France |the work is a musical composition=no |country of first publication=France |date of first publication=1926 |date of author death=1928 |author died for France=no }}\n\nTeofilo (talk)\n\nThis is an interesting approach, having copyright data metadata templates for various countries, including data relevant for status in those countries. That way we wouldn't end up with one giant template with way too many fields. The way I imagine it, rather than just picking one, you could add many metadata templates for different countries. To avoid redundancy, the general {{Copyright data}} template could include information that is relevant in many countries, like the data I listed above. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nI was thinking the general {{Copyright data}} would be a switch containing only a few lines of codes starting with \" #switch:{{{country of first publication}}} \", switching to each country-specific template. If we are sure that two country have exactly the same rules we could merge them, but in that case it would be as simple to duplicate the template and just change the country name. Teofilo (talk)\n\nWell the issue is that the country of first publication is not the only relevant one. In particular the copyright status of the work in the US is relevant to us, even if not the country of first publication. The copyright status in yet another, third country may be relevant to content reusers in that country, and it may differ if the work was also published concurrently in that country. So... the easiest way to support many countries seems like it would be more than one template. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nThe \"copyright data France\" solution would be very useful in most situations in that it could automatically produce {{PD-old-70}}, {{PD-old-100}} and similar tags as appropriate and also update them at the end of each year so that the templates help reusers in a maximal way. I think that this might be the best option. However, there might be other odd situations which need to be covered somehow. For example, I have recently looked at categories of British signatures on Commons to confirm licence validity. In many cases, I found that the signature was at least {{PD-old-70}}, but I could not find any proof of any publication, or they might not have been published before 1923. In this case, the licence tag for the source country is {{PD-old-70}} whereas the licence tag for the United States is {{PD-signature}}. There might be other situations which are not covered by the template above. For these odd situations, it might be necessary to offer the possibility to take a US licence template as an argument. Also note that \"author died long before 1996\" doesn't imply {{PD-1996}} since the works nevertheless get 95 years from publication copyright if all US copyright formalities were fulfilled (including copyright notices in all US and foreign publications of the work). --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nHey, this announcement should actually make templates like this much much easier, I'd think. Once that feature gets here, anyways. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nComment It should be noted that most if not all translations of {{PD-old}}, and {{PD-old-auto}} have a license text that reads: \"This includes the USA and all countries with a copyright term of 70 years...\". And there are generally no warnings that a PD-70 license alone is not sufficient. We might want to fix that. De728631 (talk)\n\nI have now removed the United States from the templates in a few languages (Nordic, Dutch, French, Spanish and CJK) and translated the warning about US copyright tags into Swedish. I wouldn't dare to try to fix the other languages since I might mess up grammar or something if I try to remove a country name. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nAnd I've now done the same for German, Low German and North Frisian. De728631 (talk)\n\nDone for catalan (PD-Old, PD-Old-Auto and PD-Old-80).--Pere prlpz (talk)\n\nThank you for helping to correct the translations. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nRFC proposal\n\nThis is expanding from the original thread title, but I think it flows naturally from it, and we could use a concrete proposal. I suggest we launch Commons:Requests for comment/PD license tags to discuss the broader issue of how we organise license PD tags, with some of the ideas from above. I'd like some quick input on whether that's a good idea, and if so on what the scope and aims of the RFC should be. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI think this is a good idea. I think the discussion should center around two main problems: 1. how should information relevant to the copyright status of a PD image be represented and displayed on file description pages; 2. should there be a review process for PD images to research this information, and how will it work? An RfC could support a series of proposals on these topics. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nWhat's wrong with the interwiki links? Why aren't they linking to the wikipedia pages? --Wladyslaw (talk)\n\nI just come here to ask the same. They seem to work fine an hour ago. See for example Category:Cemetery Père-Lachaise. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSeem to be a global problem in all wiki projects, see: [1] --Wladyslaw (talk)\n\nThis is very strange. For some reason Institution:National Museum of the Union has red link (pointing to http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=En:National_Museum_of_the_Union&action=edit&redlink=1, using capital En:?!) while Institution:National Museum of Romanian History which is nearly identical doesn't have this problem. But if you go to File:Bratara Nr 13 MNIR IMG 7412 .JPG, the Institution:National Museum of Romanian History referenced there gets red links. What is causing this?--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nBy complete coincidence, I came across this problem at Help:Interlanguage links and Help:Interwiki linking. Sometimes the universe has a sense of humour :) ... Anyway, en:Wikipedia:VPT#Interwiki_links reveals that it's a problem with the interwiki cache. Solution: purge the problem page, eg by adding &action=purge to the URL and pressing enter. Rd232 (talk)\n\nThanks for the notes. Purge helps after they fixed it. But hopefully they will find the underlying problem for this.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nPlease help I have just uploaded an image - File:AIDS Clinic, McLeod Ganj, 2010.jpg -\n\nto WP Commons and entered it into a WP aticle. For some reason it has come up rotated 90 degrees and I don't know how to rotate it back so the image can be seen properly. I wonder if anyone could do this job for ame please and/or let me know how to do it myself? Many thanks John E. Hill (talk)\n\nI have added a rotation request to that page. This means that the image will be rotated by a bot in less than an hour. In the future, try to save the image in the correct orientation on your computer. Some programs, and in particular most Microsoft programs, often display images with the wrong orientation. As a rule of thumb, if it looks correct in your digital camera but incorrect in any Microsoft image program, do not attempt to rotate the image. The image is already correct and the fact that it looks wrong in the Microsoft image program is due to a bug in the Microsoft image program. There is more information about this at COM:ROTATEFIX if you want to know more about it. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThank you so much. The image was correctly rotated on my computer so I just assumed it would be O.K. after uploading. Looks like I have more to learn. But thanks again and all best wishes, John E. Hill (talk)\n\nFebruary 2\n\nI expanded into an older conversation at User talk:JarektBot#Interwiki to dissimilar page types regarding Category interwiki vs Article interwiki. I though this is a generic enough topic to drop a note here. Maybe the entire conversation should be moved here as well.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nCOM:Interwiki is redlink, \"interwiki\" search found nothing, so I will ask here - is it OK to add interwiki to category? Bulwersator (talk)\n\nYes, adding an interwiki to a Wikipedia category is abviously okay. Adding an interwiki to a Wikipedia article is also convenient and seems to be standard practice. The more controversial case seems to be adding the same links in both the article page and the gallery page (see for example Taipei and category:Taipei). (as far as I am concerned I like to have interwikis in categories as often as possible, just because I use categories much more often than galleries (many galleries are badly maintained and not really useful).--Zolo (talk)\n\nIt doesn't give the answer to your question, but there is actually Help:Interwiki linking. I've made a redirect. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI added Help:Interlanguage links which is a proper name to what most people call Interwiki links. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nIt's not always a perfect match but where it is it s best to pair galleries here with articles, and categories with categories. So for example with Taipei. The article en:Taipei at wikipedia should be paired with the gallery Taipei here, and the Category Category: Taipei here with en:category:Taipei there. Where there isn't an exact match I add the interwiki to which ever seems the most appropriate, be that the article or category.--KTo288 (talk)\n\nIs it possible to change the video thumbnail image by users? If not is there any way to change the thumbnail image of this video? --Vaikoovery (talk)\n\nStill yet there is no way to select another thumbnail on file pages. However on other pages (on commons or wikipedia) you may create your preferred thumbnail by using the thumbtime parameter. --Pristurus (talk)\n\nThank you :) --Vaikoovery (talk)\n\nAdvert: you may like to use User:Saibo/thumbtimefinder for finding nice stills. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nA few days ago, some changes were made to {{Information}} and they were reverted due to a lack of consensus. Some of the proposed changes have already been discussed before, but I sum it up here so that we can get a clear community view. --Zolo (talk)\n\nHave announced this request section at Template:Centralized discussion. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nDo not display the \"permission: \"see below\") when the information field is blanked\n\nOne objection for that was that we lost the link to the \"reusing content page that is displayed next to \"permission\".\n\nSupport permission: \"see below\" looks pretty strange. MediaWiki:Gadget-Stockphoto.js adds a more prominent link to the \"reusing content\" page. --Zolo (talk)\n\nSupport The \"see below\" notification is barely useful, rather senseless and unsightly. Whatever location of the link to Commons:Reusing content outside Wikimedia is better. --Petrus Adamus (talk)\n\nSupport I agree with Zolo and Petrus. --Leyo\n\nSupport I do not like \"see below\" - I thinks is not necessary and it clutters the screen. If \"permission\" is used than the template works as it does now. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nComment See previous discussions: 1 2 and 3. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSupport never liked the \"see below\" approach. Rd232 (talk)\n\nSupport Useless. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nSupport Never liked it. --Sreejith K (talk)\n\nQuestion Will the field be hidden, or show no-license-warning? If hidden, Support, but if we show warning I Oppose. – Kwj2772 (msg)\n\nInfo It would be hidden, like other versions now. --Petrus Adamus (talk)\n\nSupport - maybe the Commons:Reuse link can be shown in the \"author\" field if permission is empty? --Saibo (Δ)\n\nThis parameter will probably not be used very often? It adds a new customizable field to the template just like the already existing \"other fields\" , but at a different place: between description and date rather that at the end of the template. A similar result can be achieved by directly adding {{Information field}} to the \"description\" field.\n\nSupport As I said here the new proposed parameter Other_field_1 similar to Other_field and the same as {{Artwork}}'s Other_field_1. The purpose of it would be to allow adding other fields below Description field rather than the bottom of the template. See the code in {{Information/sandbox}} and test in Template:Information/testcases#Test_Other_field_1. This would allow us to rewrite {{Infobox aircraft image}}, {{Bus-Information}}, {{Rolling Stock-Information}} and possibly many others to use {{Information}} as their basis and simplify maintenance of those templates. It would also allow users to add additional description fields in more logical location. See for example File:Kyushu Electric tram 3.jpg with additional \"location\" field located on the bottom. The change will not affect any files currently using the template. Finally this proposed change is mostly meant to make wiki code more clear since once achieve the same effect without this field, see here. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSupport I don't understand all the details of this issue, but from Jarekt's description, it sounds sensible. Rd232 (talk)\n\nSupport I think it is useful. --Petrus Adamus (talk)\n\nDid not dive in deeply, but that sounds useful and not hurting. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nRemove {{Parse source}} from the source field\n\nParse source automatically converts texts like \"Obra pròpia (own work)\" to {{Own work}}.\n\nWeak support. {{Information}} was designed to appear simple and without much \"magic\" feel, the automatic conversion of exotic strings may be a bit confusing (all the more as it works for \" Eigenes Werk (own work)\" but not for \"eigenes Werk\". Hopefully, more and more uploading tools will use the correct {{Own}} making {{Parse source}} unnecessary. On the other hand, a bot should convert existing pages so that internationalization is not lost.--Zolo (talk)\n\nSupport Quite cryptic, I would prefer a robotic substitution of the texts to {{Own work}}. --Petrus Adamus (talk)\n\nOppose I did not notice that template before, and did not see that this edit removed it. Although I would prefer a robotic substitution of the texts to {{Own work}}, I do not see the reason to change current version. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSupport removing fancyness. That is very unobvious that the info template does that. It should display what the user put in - nothing more or less. Could lead to confusion at this important info field. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nAlign the content to the same line as the headers (now it is lower)\n\nDescription is now lower than the title Description, proper date lower than the title date etc.\n\nSupport The present different alignment looks ugly and should be improved. --Petrus Adamus (talk)\n\nSupport This alignment was a side-effect of switching from quite confusing mix of wiki-tables and html-tables to plain html-tables used by all the other major infobox templates ({{Artwork}}, {{Book}}, {{Creator}} and {{Institution}}). It also was meant to fix incorrect template rendering shown here. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nSupport per Petrus Adamus and Jarekt.

Try this. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nEncyclopaedias, Wikipedia or any other, are not a basis of knowledge. They merely digest and organize the information that is available from many sources. So, your professor may tell you not to use encyclopaedias \"as a basis of knowledge\", to force you to dig more deeply into the sources and read them directly. Then the idea would be to verify where the information came from in the first place, instead of using only the encyclopaedias where the information is reused. You can use Wikipedia or other encyclopaedias to get a personal overview of the topic and to find a list of sources that were used to write the article and other references. Then you can select and read directly the sources and references that you consider relevant for your paper and cite those readings in your paper. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nRecommended further reading on this: en:Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nHow do you even got here?

If you disagree, replace this template with your comment. 01:17, 3 February 2012 (UTC)\n\nOn the Danish Wikipedia there currently is a suggestion to replace the current 'Upload file'-link in the sidebar with a link to either Commons:Upload/da or Danish language own work. This has thrown off two issues, which I'm not quite sure where to address:\n\nUploads using Danish language own work or Swedish language own work (and possible also others) doesn't show allowed filetypes but just '$1'. Is this a bug for bugzilla or a translation-issue I can't figure the source for (I would have assumed MediaWiki:UploadForm.js/Documentation#Localization but no dice there...)?\n\nIt has been proposed that files uploaded using the Commons:Upload/da, the Danish language own work or a new custom form, have a special category (alternatively a template - i.e. similar to {{ImageUpload|basic}} when using the basic upload form previously) added. I would have assumed Commons:Redesigning the upload form or User:Pfctdayelise/Manual:Uselang hack would describe that - but again I didn't manage to find anything :( Is this possible somehow?\n\nInd kind regards heb [T C E]\n\nThe first was a wrong configuration; I have fixed it now. It may take up to 24h until the fix becomes effective due to the way the MediaWiki software caches its interface texts. The second is currently not possible. However, why would you want to have such a marker category at all? Maybe an alternative approach might be a specially configured upload wizard? Maybe it's possible to use the \"upload campaign\" feature to customize the wizard in ways that might be acceptable to your needs? Lupo\n\nFirst: Thank you for fixing the configuration-error :)\n\nSecond: As I'm not an administrator on Commons, I don't know if upload campaign could work, but I'll encourage someone on DaWiki, who is also an administrator on Commons, to look into this so thank you for the suggestion :) The reasoning for this, is that most of the files uploaded \"vetted\" by someone with Danish language-skills, as they have a high error-rate (lack of license, copyvio's etc.). Of the current last 20 uploads (covering the time back to 17 January 2012, 11 have been deleted for being clear copyright violations, and of the remain 9, for 3 of the files, the uploaders are currently being \"helped\" so that they have correct and sufficient information. By adding them to a special category, it would be easier for Danish speaking wikipedians to identify and correct the issues in a helpful and leaning manner. In kind regards heb [T C E]\n\nMy mistake, I didn't realise that the \"region\" field used ISO-3166 in these templates, so some of them have \"region:UK\" instead of the correct \"region:GB\". There may be a few hundred but is there a bot that could go though and substitute these for the correct version? Cheers. Rodhullandemu (talk)\n\nMaybe I'm being dense, but how would the bot distinguish your errors from places that are actually in Ukraine? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nBecause the ISO 3166 code for Ukraine is UA, not UK.

Thanks. Rodhullandemu (talk)\n\nI think that it may be a good idea to add \"categories are OK\" next to list of categories (the same as \"Check them now!\" on Template:Check categories) - it is inefficient to change categories using hotcat, scroll to Template:Check categories, hit \"Check them now!\", scroll to save, hit save Bulwersator (talk)\n\nSomething like this Bulwersator (talk)\n\nI would appreciate such an option. --Funfood ␌\n\nI would recommend against adding such a thing to HotCat: the functionality desired is completely different, and Commons-specific. HotCat is for changing and adding categories, and it's being used on many wikis, even on non-WMF projects. This new functionality is a special-purpose hack for one template existing only here at the Commons, and the desired functionality is just removing the template in one click.

What must be do? غلامرضا باقری (talk)\n\nAs a native speaker, they are exactly equally correct. There is one subtle difference, in that when one is talking about the structure of a particular American university, one speaks of its \"school of arts and sciences\", \"school of engineering\", etc. and in that context one would almost always say \"school of medicine\" because of the parallelism. Conversely, one would say \"he went to medical school at the University of Washington\", but not \"he went to the school of medicine at...\" (though this doesn't apply to \"he graduated from\" or \"he attended\", which can use either).

Could be en:Patio, although in the US at least that tends to carry more of a residential connotation. cmadler (talk)\n\nIt is very common on the continent and certainly in warmer countries for restaurants, bar and other drinking places to have seats and tables on the street. On warm sunny days, clients dont want to be inside. In most countries such places have pay extra taxes to use the street for tables and chairs. Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nTry Category:Open air restaurant and café areas or a subcategory under that? cmadler (talk)\n\nThanks, I wil use this last one.Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nThere are a lot of categories like this that are in Category:Meta categories. This is apparently done by template {{Monthbyyear}}. To me, these don't seem to fit the definition of metacategories. Am I missing something? --Auntof6 (talk)\n\nI think you are correct, so I removed the metatemplate from Template:Monthbyyear. Month categories can be further divided by date, by country, or by something else. But it is not neccessary to always do that. And I think there may be files that does not fit into such subdivisions. /Ö\n\nSounds good -- thanks! --Auntof6 (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI have seen that WMF posted a video (File:Monthly Metrics Meeting February 2, 2012.theora.ogv).

Amada44 talk to me\n\nThis week (Monday through Thursday), I will be switching over the backend system that hosts thumbnails (scaled images) for all wikis from our existing server to Swift, a clustered object store. This move gets us ready to be able to dramatically increase the amount of data we can hold in Commons and the other wiki projects.\n\nAs with all new systems, though it has been tested, the possibility exists that something will go wrong. I would like your help testing and reporting any issues. There are two main methods available to report issues:\n\nIRC: join #wikimedia-tech and ping maplebed\n\nWiki: add a section to the Issues page on mediawiki.org.\n\nToday, only files that contain \"/a/a2/\" in the URL are be affected. More files will be affected throughout the week following a gradual rollout schedule. Though I will take bug reports on other issues, they're less likely to be related to the change I'm making.\n\nMore detail is available on the wikitech-l mailing list post I wrote last week.\n\nThanks for your help, Bhartshorne (talk)\n\nFebruary 7\n\nShouldn't this category be \"hidden\" as other categories of the same sort, for example Category:Taken with Canon PowerShot A620?

Prof. Professorson (talk)\n\nTo alleviate multilingual issues and have the categories searchable in multiple languages, I've been using Sum-it-up to add descriptions and interwiki links to categories (see for example Category:Dacia). But I find the task terribly redundant and repetitive. Can bots like User:MerlIwBot and User:JarektBot do this for each category and gallery, since articles and their leads in multiple languages appear/change all the time? It currently does it for interwiki links which are also followed and generated by Sum-it-up. I think it would be a tremendous feature, and should be basically part of the same process. Note that I started initially this conversation at User talk:MerlIwBot#Adding also multilingual descriptions but then I realized that JarektBot also has similar capabilities, and this is more of a global discussion.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nI see that more and more people start to see the interest and are following. Before adding text descriptions by bot, we have to define a collapse rule. Categories with an intro in 270 languages is not very practical. A more elegant and maintenance-free solution would be the display of the initial paragraphs(s) when hovering over the interwiki links on the left. It would be great if the search engine would include the category IWs in its search, which it doesn't for the moment. --Foroa (talk)\n\nI am not sure based on which settings, but in my system Category:Dacia displays a pull down box for the languages using Meta:Language select. It doesn't display descriptions in all languages unless you select \"Show all\" in the pull down box. This seems sufficient to me. I am missing something? --Codrin.B (talk)\n\nFor me is the main purpose of the explaining text to know what subject is covered by the category. I don't need all the links in the often long text generated by Sum-it-up. Without shows a \"cleaner\" text. If people want more information they can use the interwiki links on the left. Wouter (talk)\n\nTo me, Category:Dacia shows all texts in all languages, which is probably a bug or maybe related to a show all that I used on a previous selection and that stays on. Anyway, I think that in all cases, the English reference text should always be displayed for reference and the description in the local languages(s) where applicable. Nowadays, I bother rarely to include texts in more than 2 or 3 languages, except where there are many terms in many languages, such as in Category:Mbira and Category:Pedal cars so that they are included in the search engine database (category interwikis are never included in the search). --Foroa (talk)\n\nI am curious to know what setting enables/disables (or rather collapses) the other languages. If you find out, please let us know. I looked in my preferences but couldn't find it. For me it is always collapsed, showing English. Sum-it-up can indeed sometimes generate longer descriptions, but id depends on the leads that people create. Over time, the source articles get copy edited and end up with better leads. A reason why we need a bot to run this on a schedule. And yes, sometimes I had to shorten the generated descriptions myself. But overall, I think it is highly valuable to have that multilingual text since it empowers users to find the information with search engines. You can click on the links to the left, but someone searching in Japanese will never find an English named category, unless these descriptions are added. And if we can reliably collapse all languages and show English by default, it is all we need for a nice solution.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nI've been using sum-it-up for quite some time (do check out the gadget). I even used it for batch created categories. Some improvements:\n\nIt should use {{Multilingual description}}\n\nA bit more cleaning up should happen (like removing reference templates)\n\nI doubt Magnus will fix it, so someone might want to fork the tool. Multichill (talk)\n\nSuch improvements would be nice - as would fixing the annoyance that the tl.wp doesn't translate to template:tl, but to template:tgl, which sum-it-up doesn't know! But really, if we're going for improvements, one thing which would be worth thinking about is whether we couldn't persuade the source Wikipedias to provide a custom 1 or 2 line summary (like persondata), stripped of ref tags and images which don't translate to the Commons summary, and hopefully more stable. (If the custom summary isn't available, the bot/script can always fall back to the status quo.) Rd232 (talk)\n\nWell, perhaps that's not worth the complexity. Just a script that does better cleanup (stripping ref tags and images) would do.

Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nDone, thank you for the input, -- Cirt (talk)\n\nTriggered by #Hotcat and Category:Media needing category review, I wrote some lines of code doing the following:\n\nRemoving {{Check categories}} from files when changing categories with HotCat on this page\n\nAdding a link \"Categories are OK!\" to the category-section that removes the template.\n\nI would like to add this to our Gadget-Definition of HotCat. Technically no problem. Are there any objections? -- RE rillke questions?\n\nThat one category is changed with hotcat does not mean that all the categories are checked. So Template:Check categories should not be removed just because of that.\n\nA \"categories are ok\" link is better, since one can look at all the categories together and can say that thery are OK. /Ö\n\nWe have such a big backlog of check-categories files that I thought it might be ok removing the template if someone had a look at them. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nSounds good, be bold and see what happens.\n\nThe usage of {{Check categories}} got a bit out of hand and the suggestions get better over time. I'm thinking of just removing the template from Category:Media needing category review with 1 suggested category (69.000 items) and Category:Media needing category review with 2 suggested categories (48.000 items) as these suggestions are generally quite good compared to Category:Media needing category review with 10 or more suggested categories. What do you think about that? Multichill (talk)\n\nThat looks a good idea provided one can filter out the ones with only generic categories such as men, woman, people, people by name, paintings, art, ... Same for the HotCat check removal. We might need a template to indicate \"generic\" categories. --Foroa (talk)\n\nIt least there are no or very few \"wrong\" categories. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nIf you want to remove it from all categories, you could add\n\n.checkcategories {display: none;}\n\nto Special:MyPage/common.css. -- Docu at\n\nThat's just hiding from the display, not removing. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nI'd go with option 2 as an easy way to remove the template; option 1 doesn't sound quite right. I'd also suggest an option 3: on pages where the template exists, if you use the \"edit multiple categories\" option of HotCat, then by default the template is struck through, and if the user saves, it's removed. That way, the user can prevent the template removal by clicking the little X to cancel the template change; but the assumption is that usually when editing multiple categories, template removal will be reasonable. Makes sense? Rd232 (talk)\n\nI agree that \"the usage of {{Check categories}} got a bit out of hand\", to reduce the backlog it's ok to delete the template after using HotCat by default. --Chris.urs-o (talk)\n\nI know that it is OK to have file names in many languages on Commons, but what is the recommended approach for naming categories? I've been working a lot to organize media around the Romanian history and archaeology topics and noticed for example that Category:Museums in Romania by city has a big mix of Romanian and English names for the sub-categories. For example Category:Muzeul Național al Hărților și Cărții Vechi vs Category:History and Archeology Museum Piatra Neamț. Looking at institutions, most of them are in English (not all) and point ideally to categories with the same name. A similar situation happens with Category:Fortresses in Romania and many such similar categories. Now I understand Romanian but I would imagine that it would be hard for someone who doesn't to either properly categorize their own contributions (say they took a picture of the Alba Carolina Fortress while visiting Alba Iulia) or to find media related to a certain topic/category if there is no English name for it. Ideally, it would be great to have both categories, one in English and one in Romanian, and possibly redirect the Romanian-named category to the English one, but I know there are issues with the redirects in Commons. My approach would be to have everything in English (acknowledging that this is a multilingual project), to increase exposure and achieve consistency. What are your suggestions and opinions about this? Thanks--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nThe real category names should usually be in English (see Commons:Language policy, and Commons:Categories#Category_names). If there is no real English alternative, the foreign names are often fine I'd guess, if in a Latin script. It's unfortunate as a multilingual project, but the actual category name used in the File: pages has to be all the same so that users of all languages can find the content; category redirects do not work on that level. You can certainly leave a category soft redirect (i.e. use {{Category redirect}}) with the existing Romanian name, which should cause bots to move images placed in the Romanian one, to the English one. Putting the Romanian name in the category description is also a good idea. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nAs Carl mentioned all the category names should be in English, or should be in form most commonly used in English literature (if any exist). In practice it is a challenge with no good solution, since often in case of places little known outside their country local language names are used, which often creates disastrous names using mix of English and local language which is not readable by neither English speaking nor local users. I sometimes use counts of Google hits to try different possible variants of English names which can be used. Also EN wiki is a good guide if they have an article. Finally {{Category redirect}}s, interwiki links and native spelling listed in the category will help native speakers find the category. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThanks guys, that is my view as well but wondering what is the general idea. I think there are English names at least for all those museums and castles that I used in the example, even though not all of them have corresponding en WP article yet. I am actually actively involved in creating such articles but will take time. To alleviate multilingual issues and have the categories searchable in multiple languages, I've been using Sum-it-up to add descriptions and interwiki links to categories (see for example Category:Dacia). But I find the task terribly redundant and repetitive. Can bots like User:MerlIwBot do this for each category and gallery, since articles and their leads in multiple languages appear/change all the time? It currently does it for interwiki links which are also followed and generated by Sum-it-up.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nI personally find this guidance to be a major problem in making Commons truly multilingual. We have several contributors on ro.wp which say they don't use commons for pictures because they don't speak English. When you try to open up to more people, like it happened for Wiki Loves Monuments, this problem becomes much more visible.\n\nI believe that each user should be free to use whatever language he wants for categories, just like it happens for galleries, with the local language prefered. The category-redirect method Carl described should work just as well from English to Romanian as it does the other way around.\n\nI urge you to consider changing this guidance even before MediaWiki has support for this (as fixing that bug could take years)--Strainu (talk)\n\nBut that doesn't work. There are many cases where languages use the same word to mean different things; is Category:Magazine about supermarkets or periodicals? what about Category:Cat?--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nStrainu, I wish we could, but as Prosfilaes said, that is not feasible on the large scale. To some degree we already do it on a small scale: we do have about 60k category redirects, and many of them contain alternative spelling often used in different counties. However we can not mix all the languages and be able to maintain our category system, it is hard enough in English alone. As for people who do not speak English: we put a lot of effort into internationalization of our templates and ideally all categories would have interwikis and description in many languages. That way people without English skills can at least use search to identify existing categories. They can also use Galleries written in their language and they can find links from their wikipedias to Commons categories. It is unfortunate that although Commons have interwiki links to Wikipedia, wikipedia do not have interwiki links to Commons, and have to rely on templates like en:template:Commons category. The problem with those templates is that each section of an article can have such template (so there is no guarantee of 1 to 1 relationship) and that those templates are not maintained by the mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot/interwiki.py which is used for maintaining interwiki links. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nChinese Wikipedia displays category names in either Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese depending on settings. For example, zh:分類:美國 and zh:分类:美国 both mean the same thing and so they go to the same page. How they are displayed depends on your choice in a dropdown list. Wouldn't it be possible to do something similar with Commons? I assume that many categories would have overlapping names, but wouldn't it still be possible to fix something with the categories which don't overlap? Chinese Wikipedia mainly converts things algorithmically, but I think that there also is some way to specify a variant manually if the automatic handling doesn't work. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nStrainu -- I agree with Prosfilaes. Allowing multilingual categories (other than limited endonym use) without a very radical and fundamental change in the basic software setup would be far more likely to cause numerous disputes such as that which resulted in Category:Mélusines in heraldry being set up in opposition to Category:Melusines in heraldry, rather than leading to some utopia of internationalization. AnonMoos (talk)\n\nAnd don't forget that for the many cities, border areas and countries that have 2 to 4 languages, the English rule is a blessing. --Foroa (talk)\n\nTo this end, I tried in the past to suggest the move of Category:Traianus to Category:Trajan but someone reverted this. Now we have subcats like Category:Arch of Trajan (Benevento)‎ and Category:Arch of Traianus (Ancona)‎. Or Category:Trajan's Bridge but Category:Gate of Traianus‎.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nFor popes, emperors, gods, saints and some rulers, we tend to use the original latin name as the root category as those are more \"international universal\". --Foroa (talk)\n\nI'd like to add a comment on choice of forum:\n\nThe question is about the most controversial category of language choices on Commons. This village pump is read mostly by those that have no problem working in English (others use village pumps in other languages) and I think answers here will be somewhat biased.\n\nIf the question had been asked on Commons talk:Language policy, on the other hand, it would have been answered by people interested in language use of Commons, and support for using local names would probably have been stronger (still with a bias, as policy is mainly written and discussed in English).\n\nFor categories about things, yes we use English when there is an established English word. For local names, especially less known places, some use a local language, some use English. There is no policy or even guideline discussing the border line cases - because there is no consensus.\n\n--LPfi (talk)\n\nThe arguments Prosfilaes put up do not sound insurmountable. First of all, the number of conflicts does not seem that big. Even then, I think that keeping just a few hundred generic categories in English and naming all the rest (like names of places, names of people) in the local language would work just fine. Only when several official names exist for a place and there is no consensus should English be used.--Strainu (talk)\n\nLPfi, that is a good point. I didn't know about the Commons talk:Language policy. I will make a note about this conversation. I also found the Commons:Naming categories proposal and Commons:Categories#Category names. But suggest English for most usage but also mention exceptions and that consensus was not reached. I think we do have to find the best compromise and finalize the proposal. Above all, I think that consistency and search-ability are the most important aspects.--Codrin.B (talk)\n\nJanuary 31\n\nFile deleted as an emergency request on the Admin Noticeboard by me. I got worried about banking laws on copying checks! Better safe than sorry. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nanyone can prove that the attribution of \"File:Deep water wave.gif\" as \"own work\" is true. See discussion here: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kraaiennest: and what happened simultaneously: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/File:Pi.tif Doug youvan (talk)\n\nI resent any implication that there's a connection. I don't know who Kraaiennest is, nor have I been influenced by him at all. I haven't asked for source code at Pi.tif.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI am sorry; it was a coincidence. I was very upset that File:Tasting_a_condom.jpg survives deletion, while I am being deleted here at Commons, and Kraaiennest/Crowsnest has erased the past 10 years of my work (3 e-books) in my biography at .en, while there, I am banned from editing, indefinitely. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nThe economic potential is enormous, see http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/business/global/21iht-renwave.html?pagewanted=all, and I think the main point of my comment is that Commons needs to set policy for depositing images that have no source code in the PD. We are not talking Photoshop, folks. These are custom programs designed to produce one (possibly a few) images, and it is the programmers, not the Uploader, whose work has been used without attribution. Worse yet, without source code the image (simulation) might be completely wrong. It then goes into the encyclopedia and evades NOR. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nThis seems to be a dispute that has spilled over from en.wiki. Please see en:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive734#Legal_threats_and_spamming_by_Noncanonical. en:User:Crowsnest is User:Kraaiennest. Doug youvan, if you wish to contribute constructively to Commons, you are welcome. But, you are well-advised to avoid engendering drama and conflict here. Anyone may review File:Deep water wave.gif and nominate it for deletion. But because of your history of involvement with Crowsnest/Kraaiennest, it may be unwise for you to do so. Best wishes, Walter Siegmund (talk)\n\nWalter. Thank you. I will do exactly as you say. Would you please start the discussion as to what we should do with images (simulations) that lack computer code? One explanation from some of these Uploaders is that the equations are published and referenced. However, if you have ever coded to simulate a physical system, it is almost always the case that parameters arise which must be set in a logical, but somewhat arbitrary, manner. I've started to recode the simulation in question, and such parameters have arisen immediately. (I can outline those problems somewhere else if anyone is interested.) But the upshot is that the current image / simulation is irreproducible. I do similar work and I always put the code into the PD. I see no other way to show that the image is correct - or at least check it and improve it. So, I will place my efforts into re-coding File:Deep water wave.gif. That image is, in fact, beautiful and informative for people interested in such things. However, if you look deeper, you begin wondering how it was done and how particular parameters were set. This is quite analogous to a \"trade secret\". BTW, you will be hard pressed to find any legal threat from Noncanonical, a colleague of mine using this same IP address.. That's just a gang that wants us off the encyclopedia because of my religious views. After all, Wikipedia is the atheist's bible, and I need to learn how to show proper respect to this other religion. That is my fault, and as a Christian, I do recognized that I have sinned, and I ask for forgiveness from anyone I might have hurt.\n\nThat was not the incident that got me kicked off (a long time ago). That was Hrafn, Aunt Entropy, and Filll over the Young Earth Creationist Article. Some guy in Australia made a physical threat in an edit tag and I reacted. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nI for one don't think Doug youvan has $25000, much less is willing to donate it. He's upset that User_talk:Kraaiennest would not release the source code used to produce File:Deep water wave.gif. The user is under no obligation to do so. If you believe that an image derived from source code not owned by the uploader could make this an illegal derivative work, then by all means nominate it for deletion, but there's no need to dramatically call attention to it here. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\n100KDoug youvan (talk)\n\nThe graphic image is not derivative of the source code; they are independent works. Depending on the circumstances, the graphic image may or may not be copyrightable (if it is purely the result of an algorithm, with no human authorship of the actual graphic part, it may not be copyrightable at all). But the computer program copyright is in how the program is structured, its actual text, and that kind of thing, none of which is present in the resulting graphic. They are unrelated copyright-wise (no shared expression at all). Even if an author does make two works, one of which is derivative of the other, it is entirely up to an author whether they want to license the original, the derivative, or both. Even if they released the original under a CC-BY-SA license, they are not under any obligation to release their own derivative work that way. Obviously, we'd appreciate as much material as the author would like to license, but it's the author's prerogative in the end. If you think it would be more appropriate to only use illustrations like this on en-wiki which also have backing source code, then discuss it there -- that is a project policy decision. When you bring up something on Commons though, we are mostly concerned about copyright only. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nCarl, Thank you. Do you mean Commons will use an image that has violated a license agreement for the use of the underlying program? Or do you mean that if a team of people write some code that produces an image, it is OK for one of them to donate the image here as \"author's own work\"? Can't be! What about the Industrial Espionage Act of 1996? Has it expired?Doug youvan (talk)\n\nIn the case of multiple authors, yes, any one author can do what they want, usually. The other authors are entitled to their share of money made, but beyond that not much. This is spelled out in the copyright law. That would only apply though if some other people were responsible for the appearance of the resulting image itself -- it would not matter if some other code author supplied utility routines which were merely used for the image; I don't think they are an author of the image itself. If someone violated a license agreement by simply using such code, that is their problem. I'm sure we'd delete upon request from the uploader/author if it turned out such an image got them into unexpected legal trouble.\n\nI don't believe that they're independent works. XPM is a image file format that is also valid C code. Surely that must be a derivative of the image. When I'm working on a POV-Ray file, the artistic description that goes into the code is what comes out in the image. It strikes me as like the book/movie divide, where literary expression can be infringed by the visual images.\n\nYou say that \"if it is purely the result of an algorithm, with no human authorship of the actual graphic part\". If what you mean is post-processing, then I disagree as above. Senso stricto, it's false; all images can be produced algorithmically. In reality, I can see a judge using that rule of thumb, but I can also see a judge granting copyright to a CG tornado if it was used in Twister 2, but denying it to the exact same tornado if the meteorology department that produced the simulation sued. I'm not sure where the line is.\n\nI agree that we don't need the source code, that we can just take the derivative.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI don't think a book can be infringed by visual images -- can you point to a case? Obviously, a movie can be derivative if it makes use of dialogue, the plot, or characters from a book. The visual images are added expression, unique to the movie. XPM is probably a special case -- since there is really only one or limited ways to write the program to generate a specific image, I'm not sure there is a separate copyright in that type of program. In any event, the image comes first in that case, and the C program would be derivative (or a copy, really). But I'm sure in many cases such as the one under discussion, you could write a completely different program (separate copyright) which produces the same, or very similar, output image. If the program source contains graphics themselves which get placed in the output, that is when you might get into derivative works for me. But if an author is using a program as a tool to generate their desired output image... of course the output should be their own copyrightable work (which I think is the case here, easily). The result is still human authorship, no matter how they went about it. Just not derivative, copyright-wise, of the actual code, which is utterly different expression. You have to identify the actual expression from the original in a derivative work. If you can't, it's not derivative. What I meant by algorithm is... say, take an arbitrary input image and apply some algorithmic transformation to it, like scaling, or slanting. I don't see how there is human authorship in the result, since all expression is really coming from the input image. I don't think the program author can claim any copyright ownership of such images -- it's a mechanical processing of other images, with no human decision-making with regards to a specific image. They may have a terms of use which may act like a contract, but I don't think they could use copyright to enforce it. I suppose there may be examples along those lines which are different, if the processing adds some identifiable expression. But I'm more thinking of these sections from the Compendium: The term \"authorship\" implies that, for a work to be copyrightable, it must owe its origin to a human being. Materials produced solely by nature, by plants, or by animals are not copyrightable. [...] To be an original work of authorship, the work must not be a mere computation based upon a concept or formula, or be the mere extrapolation or application of an idea or system, which would always produce substantially the same result whenever done correctly by anyone. For example, the computation of interest based upon a particular rate is not copyrightable, nor is the mere transposition of music from one key to another. In the current case, I have no doubt the resulting image is copyrightable, but I'm guessing it does not contain any expression from the source code (the text, or at least program structure, etc.), so I think there are two separate copyrights. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nLet me inject some ethics to see if it copesthetic with copyright law: If you touch it in a significant manner, your name goes on it. As a staffer at LBNL and Cold Spring Harbor Lab, as a Professor at MIT, and as the CEO and CSO of a Silicon Valley company, I put everyone's name on scientific papers and patents. There is a caveat on patents, but I was generous so that the criterion of writing at least one claim was fulfilled. Now, if I see an image on Commons, I expect that everyone who contributed to that image receives attribution. If we are talking software, that would be a programmer, not someone using Photoshop. Do you get my point? Always make all attributions to all that helped with the final product, in this case, an image. How do these ethics fit into your discussion of copyright law? Do we have the same ethical standards? Doug youvan (talk)\n\nI think we are (probably all) in agreement with your ethical principal that if you touch it in a significant manner, your name goes on it; the question is what constitutes a \"significant manner\". We now have on Commons a finished work, but there were many steps that went into creating it. You (Doug youvan) seem to be asserting (forgive me if I misunderstand the technical aspects, which is not my area of expertise) that the creator of a program that is used to make an image has some degree of ownership/creatorship in that image. It seems to me that is analagous to suggesting that a weaver who makes a canvas is a co-creater with the actual painter? cmadler (talk)\n\n\"Credit\" is not the same thing as \"authorship\" or \"copyright ownership\". Everyone appreciates credit, of course, so your ethical approach is sound. For a scientific paper, I'm sure anyone involved in the research would want some credit. In general, I would follow that approach. However, a website which scans old public domain photos and makes them available online also wants credit -- they put forth effort and spent money to make things available -- but they are not an author. They are a source, but have no ownership interest in the copyright, and cannot use copyright to enforce licenses or anything like that. We are especially interested in the author for a couple reasons. First, many countries require the author, specifically, to be named via their \"moral rights\" laws (which often last longer than the economic rights, sometimes being of infinite duration, and usually cannot be transferred or waived). Second, the author is usually the copyright owner, and they are the only entity which has the authority to license the copyright, and we are heavily concerned about that license -- so we want a clear indication of who has the rights to make the license. I.e., the same person or entity which would be named in a U.S. copyright notice. For a corporate work, this would be the company, even if they may or may not separately give credit to individual employees. For your more general \"credit\", sure, we want to mention any relevant information like that if we can, but really only the uploader really has an idea of who really touched it \"in a significant manner\", so almost always we will just let the uploader decide. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI can't point to a case where an image infringed on a book, but I can imagine it for a sufficiently complex word-picture. I'm having trouble with your distinction between the code and the output of the code. An MP3 or JPEG are in some sense just code for a specialized interpreter. I can't imagine a program that played a copyrighted song or displayed copyrighted artwork would get treated as contributory infringement; they would treat it is a direct copy. I don't know how someone could have a copyright on the output of a program and yet have no copyright on the program, so that anyone can pass it around.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nAn MP3 or JPEG is really just data, at that level -- there are no instructions in the sense of it being a computer program, and no real human authorship. Two programmers can write separate programs to perform the same task; the copyright is not based on the task it performs but rather each programmer's expression in the way they did it -- it's tied to the actual text, or slightly more abstractly in how they order and group the instructions, i.e. the structure of the program. The BSD Unix systems were able to be released under their license because they gradually rewrote the entire codebase of the original, proprietary Unix system they started with -- even though it performed the exact same function, the code itself had been completely re-written, such that Berkeley was now the sole author and copyright owner, despite the fact that AT&T wrote the original code. To me, graphic images and a literary-based copyright are utterly different types of expression, and it's difficult to me to think of a situation where one could be derivative of the other -- a paragraph can describe an idea, but someone else can write a different paragraph to describe the same idea, and that second paragraph is not derivative of the first. The copyright is in the expression, i.e. the specific words and phrases chosen. Someone making an image depicting the same idea would seem to be even more removed from the original copyright than someone writing a different paragraph. I'm really not familiar with how much coding goes into an image like this, but it sounds like it's enough to carry its own copyright. Someone else could write their own program to generate the same image, and that program would not infringe the copyright on the first (unless they copied the actual text of the code, or something very close to it). But, if the output is also copyrightable (the choice of colors, the specific way they illustrated the idea), the output image of the second program could still infringe on the output image of the first program -- the second person is at that point copying the expression seen in the first image, when they make theirs. If there is really only one way or limited ways to write a program to generate a particular output image, then the program itself may not be separately copyrightable -- that may be a merger doctrine issue. In your example above, you would have to copy the data/expression from the song or artwork in order to embed it into your program in the first place. Image viewer software has its own copyright, of course, and other people can write other image viewers without infringing the first. An image viewer to display a particular, copyrighted image is substantially the same program, except of course they would have to copy the image data into the program instead of being given an arbitrary source, and that part would be infringement, of course. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI would state the analogy as being more like a painter and a photographer. You spend months painting a beautiful picture (the software) and I walk in one day and photograph your work with a digital camera (the image). I upload on Commons as \"my own work\". Obviously, that is very unfair to you. And again, this software is not Photoshop. It might be called \"sole-purpose\" software. It was written to produce a few images, perhaps even just one, or a single animation. This is often the case when we write programs to simulate a physical phenomenon. I think I would be correct in saying that most of the examples on www.youvan.com are \"sole-purpose\" programs - so, I am incredibly sensitive to this issue of attribution when I think I see a photographer ripping off an artist. Thanks for making me think in understandable terms. I am often terse and get people mad! Doug youvan (talk)\n\nThat is a straightforward derivative work (at best) and copyright infringement -- the photograph is subject to the copyright of the painting, as it uses the painting's expression, and we would delete such a photo unless 1) we also had permission from the painter, or 2) the copyright in the painting has expired. It's even possible, if the photo is basically a reproduction of the painting (i.e. a {{PD-Art}} situation), that the photographer is not even an author -- it amounts to a copy of the painting, so they added no copyrightable expression to the end result. Someone writing a separate program to perform the same general task as one of yours is not necessarily the same thing, at all. You may have given them the idea, or maybe both were inspired by a third source, but unless they copied some specific, identifiable, expression, there is no issue under copyright law, which does not protect ideas. If you are saying someone took your program to produce an animation, tweaked it a bit to produce a similar but slightly different output, maybe there is an issue -- it wound depend on many specific details, and I'm not familiar with the level of coding in this area, so I really can't say. But if you are writing a program to reproduce a physical phenomenon, you have no ownership over the phenomenon itself, and it stands to reason that an independent program would produce a somewhat similar image to illustrate the same phenomenon. There have even been cases, I'm pretty sure, where completely independent creation which resulted in substantially the same work were deemed separate, independent, non-derivative copyrights. If other people contributed code to their program, the program itself would be a derivative work and would need permission from that other person to post the source code, but I'd think only if that other person contributed code which directly resulted in creating part of the expression seen in the eventual image (and the code was supplied with that intention), would that person also be considered an \"author\" of the produced image. If someone supplied utility code which, while helpful, has no bearing on the actual expression in the eventual output image, then no, I would not consider them an author of the image, and maybe not deserving of credit (otherwise, why wouldn't you credit all the authors of Photoshop, if you used that program to help produce an image?). The authorship of the program itself, that's different. Thus, posting the source code may require a different set of permissions than the image alone. There are a lot of fuzzy boundary issues in copyright law, and this gets into some of them to be sure. But either way, it would be incumbent on the people whose actual work is involved to make the complaint. Are you saying that some of your work is infringed by this other image? Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nCarl, No I am not being infringed, but you did hit on one of the scenarios: \"If other people contributed code to their program, the program itself would be a derivative work and would need permission from that other person to post the source code, but I'd think only if that other person contributed code which directly resulted in creating part of the expression seen in the eventual image (and the code was supplied with that intention), would that person also be considered an \"author\" of the produced image.\" Quoting from from User_talk:Kraaiennest / Crowsnest: \"Dear Doug Youvan, I do not intent to make the code available, since it is (in part) the property of others.\" Now, let me try to reduce your sentence to a shorter one for this specific situation:\n\nIf other people contributed code which directly resulted in creating part of the expression seen in the eventual image that person also (must) be considered an \"author\" of the produced image. Carl - Please tell me if I got that right.\n\nHypothetically, consider that shorter italic sentence to be true in the case of Kraaiennest for File:Deep water wave.gif, so my questions is now: Did he need permission from the other authors to deposit this file?\n\nAlso, I seriously doubt that we are complying with all of this: http://www.copyright.gov/title17/ or other contractual agreements that authors have with their employer or research granting agency. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nIf there were more than one person working on producing the final image, then yes, there are probably multiple authors, and it's a joint work. I think they had to intend to produce the image together. Any one of the authors usually can license the work (at least on a non-exclusive basis) without asking any of the other authors, I'm pretty sure, at least in the U.S. Some info from William Patry here. Also, contributions to the computer program itself do not necessarily mean they are an author of the eventual image -- that would depend very much on the nature of their contributions. Really, the only case where he may have needed someone else's permission is if the image contains copyrightable expression present in some pre-existing work (i.e. another image or graphic work), and is therefore derivative. It seems rather unlikely that such an image would be derivative of another. The computer program is a separate copyright, and if chunks of code from other programs were used, then indeed that may not be able to be uploaded without additional permission. I don't see any reason at all to think there's any kind of an issue here. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI do not understand why this all creates such a fuzz. The physics behind the animation are computed with a program I am licensed to use, but of which I am not the copyright holder (and so cannot place it in the PD). There are many programs and methods around which can produce effectively the same physics data for the wave dynamics. Further, the software to create the images underlying the animation I programmed myself, and I used a series of open-source tools to create the animation from the images. So all the \"creative work\" in making the animation as it looks is my own.\n\nWhy not ask me first, instead of starting this section at the VP (without informing me) insinuating the animation is not my own work, and waving with money? -- Kraaiennest (talk)\n\nQuite funny, given the discussion above, that User:Doug youvan marks the check (File:Donation to the WMF.PNG) as \"own work\" and being the \"author\", without any further attributions. -- Kraaiennest (talk)\n\nDear Crow, Even funnier: I put up the first image without voiding the check and then had to ask for an emergency deletion! I don't know how to attribute the check, and now that it is in the mail to the WMF its even more complicated.\n\nIn reply to your other comments: Your Talk Page has a 3-week long discussion on this topic that ended the day before this discussion started when you said: \"Hello Doug, good luck and fun with your project! Regards, Kraaiennest (talk) 14:25, 5 February 2012 (UTC)\".However, I will now give you credit for anything good that has come of our interactions, and I will take the full blame for everything else. I ask you to forgive me for my bad behavior, and let's move on. The parameters I need to re-do File:Deep water wave.gif will themselves be redone and all code will be published. If I am in gross error, you can point it out if you want.\n\nI think the main point of the current discussion here on the Pump is how we should be depositing graphics (particularly animations) that are generated by customized programs of the type you and I use. The WMF has stomped on the toe of the giant textbook industry, and I am afraid some of what we are doing is going to come under attack. We just saw law change extending the copyright of certain materials that caused hundreds of images here on Commons to be threatened with deletion. I can see how the textbook industry could cry foul over over a 5+ million article encyclopedia with figures of questionable origin. You know that I have been through rough litigation on intellectual property. I have an idea of what kind of attack they would mount. I trust the GC / Foundation is aware of this potential problem and some new plan for graphics deposition is being made. What you have deposited would be some of the easiest to attack, while my contributions would be difficult to attack. You use a pseudonym, and I use a real name. You maintain code as secret, and I publish code. You have no contact information (email), but I do. We are relying on your reading of an undisclosed \"open software\" license, while I clearly use Mathematica and its well known license for nonprofit work. My resume is published, yours is not. Please be aware that I am not criticizing you, I am just pointing out our weak spots if an attempt is made to shut us down. Doug youvan (talk)\n\nCommons:Deletion requests/File:Rick santorum caricature satire made with frothy santorum pic 1.jpg\n\nMore eyes would be helpful at this deletion discussion.\n\nPieter Kuiper (talk · contribs) has apparently canvassed offsite at Wikipedia Review.\n\nSubsequently one user has showed up to deliver inappropriate rhetoric, likening the uploader (myself) to: \"lunatic fringe\".\n\nWould appreciate additional input from the community at this deletion discussion, to hopefully help to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nThank you for your time, -- Cirt (talk)\n\nI think this commons deletion request and other like it are likely to be filled with rhetoric, as the guidelines at COM:SCOPE contain too many exceptions - you could drive a wagon and horses through this policy. Following on from the debate about what is and what is not within Commons' scope at Commons:Deletion requests/File:British lion and Union flag.jpg, my complaint is that there isn't any clear defintion as to what images fall within the scope of Commons or outside, whether they be education, political or otherwise. Current policy is too wishy-washy, and provides no clear guidance, so participating in debates is almost pointless, as you are sure to come up against another editors whose views are entirely opposed to yours, yet they can still point to the same policy for justification of their views as you can. --Gavin Collins (talk)\n\nIs there a way to do this? The specific case is the new Category:Photographs by Doc Searls, and the files I'm trying to add this category to are here. 57 down, 213 to go, pretty tedious by hand! TIA, Tillman (talk)\n\nThere are some batch task tools. I'm not sure about whether they are available to everyone (I'm an admin, & I have these for myself, but it's not something I know a lot about). Rillke (talk · contribs) maintains them, so he'd know the details. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nUse Help:Cat-a-lot. These tools are available to everyone; however IPs encounter problems due to API restrictions. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nThanks! Cat-a-lot did the trick. Cheers, Tillman (talk)\n\nBe more careful with automated tools. You now added Category:Photographers from the United States to many images that just happen to be taken by someone from the US. Please revert. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nOops, my bad. Will do. Thanks, Tillman (talk)\n\nFebruary 9\n\nI just noticed that an edit I made was tagged with \"manual deletion request by new user\" as if that is something to be alarmed about. I have a couple questions about this:\n\nDo I meet the definition of a new user here? I registered nearly two years ago and have made several hundred edits and uploads.\n\nThere was a speedy deletion tag on the image, I followed the directions on the tag itself for how to contest a deletion, and found that the software tried to get me to do it the automatic way anyway, and then I got tagged as if it was a problem. Shouldn't that be fixed? Isn't there some way to integrate that functionality into the template so it is more user friendly and doing what it says to do doesn't bring up all these bells and whistles?\n\nBeeblebrox (talk)\n\nIt is something to be alarmed about. You did it wrong; you failed to list the DR properly on the deletion request page. It's not something to be ashamed about, but it's the reason the automated procedure was made and doesn't happen when it's used.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nBut it didn't tag it as \"manual deletion not done correctly\" it tagged it as \"manual deletion request by new user.\" Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nThat's because we don't have filters that can detect a manual deletion not done correctly. We apparently have filters that can detect a manual deletion request by a new user. I'm not sure we can always trust an old user to do it correctly, but manual deletion is frequently used in mass deletions, and flooding this message was probably not considered wise.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nSorry, but I don't know what you mean by \"flooding this message.\" And if manually adding deletion notices is a bad thing (I readily admit I screwed it up, I got called into work in the middle and of doing it and didn't follow through with some of the steps) then why does the speedy deletion template tell you to do it? I may not be new, but I admit I don't edit here that often other than just making uploads, so I don't know all the jargon used here. As a matter of fact, the image in question has now been deleted with the rationale that it was \"clearly DW.\" I don't know what that is supposed to mean either so it's not very helpful. Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nIf this is simply a poorly titled tag we can fix it easily at MediaWiki:Tag-manual deletion request by new user. Unfortunately, I am not sure which abuse filter is using this tag because somebody left the description blank. I'd like to know what settings the abuse filter is using prior to making changes to the tag wording. Killiondude (talk)\n\nIt's this one: \"Recommend the 'Nominate for Deletion' gadget to new users in an effort to reduce the incomplete nominations\". Jafeluv (talk)\n\nHi everyone, the the number of uncategorized files seems to have increased over the last couple of months. Who would be interested in doing a drive to lower this number? Multichill (talk)\n\nI would help, but I do not have a bot.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nI think Cat-a-lot and HotCat are the tools of choice. The bot stuff is already taken care of by the CategorizationBot. I am playing around with image recognition bot, not sure what kind of results we can get from this. Multichill (talk)\n\nThere are some people trying to categorize old uncat files (including me), but it's a long way. There are thousands of images with unclear rights and sources, not to talk about all those pics and diagrams and portraits which only the uploader may know details about. I guess most of them could go to DR without bothering, but that would also mean a big overhead and admins work. And there are always some pearls in the trash that can be used in wp articles, worth to be sorted out manually. OK, you can go the fast way and do one category per image, like \"Unidentified ...\" or \"Diagrams in ...\" to get it categorized, but that's not really satisfying at all, because those categories should also be cleaned, not filled up. I really don't know what the best solution should look like, to get rid of those uncat images. I did about 10k old files in the last months, but with each stone you take away from the bottom, 10 new grow on top.--Funfood ␌\n\nIt would be already a great help if a bot could categorise them per subject or country. It is much more efficient to categorise in a limited context and people tend to be more motivated to discover images pertaining to their country or area of interest. Even categorisation per language would already help. Frankly, if I have to process tens of images described in Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, ..., it takes much more time and one gives up quicker. --Foroa (talk)\n\nI try to find a few hours per week to assist in reducing the number of uncategorized files, but it's not easy. In many cases, you just have no clue as to what it's about... I don't know whether a bot would be helpful. Perhaps we should consider \"weeding out\" the collection of uncategorized images: images of poor technical quality, no"
