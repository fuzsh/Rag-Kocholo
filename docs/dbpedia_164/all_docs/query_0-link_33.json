        "text": "I know that it's currently customary to upload maps from OpenStreetMap using {{OpenStreetMap}} which creates a generic \"OpenStreetMap contributors\" attribution, not crediting the individual OSM contributors who worked on the data used. I also know that OpenStreetMap itself doesn't require more than this according to http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/en (Individual OSM mappers do not request a credit over and above that to “OpenStreetMap contributors”); however, OSM has chosen CC-BY-SA as their license, which can be interpreted as requiring to credit every single contributor. Again, OpenStreetMap says that this is not the case at http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ (\"There is some lack of clarity about whether a formal requirement exists in the CC-BY-SA licence to credit every single OSM contributor. We do not believe this is practical or desirable and therefore the above standards have generally been adopted\"), but it seems that the license was originally chosen without giving much thought to its implications and the matter remains slightly unclear. See also this older discussion at COM:VP - Longbow4u says there:\n\n\"The problem is that the creator of OSM (Steve Coast) had initially only a very superficial understanding of CC-BY-SA when he created the product (OSM map). He should have chosen that attribution to the project is enough (Copyright Openstreetmap under CC-BY-SA 2.0). He did not. So attribution to \"OpenStreetMap contributors\" is the only sensible choice at the moment.\"\n\nA suggestion was then made to give attribution through a link to the history of the map (excerpt) used. This is what I would like to do in an OSM map I uploaded - although it's more than OSM asks for, I would like to be 100% on the safe side - better give too precise attribution, I think. The file in question: File:Kapuzinerkloster-solothurn-lage.svg. There, I complemented \"OpenStreetMap contributors\" with a link to a history page. Problem: The history page is for a somewhat larger map area and therefore also surely contains contributors not contributing to the excerpt I made. How can I generate a link to exactly the right area in order to generate a contributors list covering only the area used? OSM doesn't let one zoom in that far. Well, however - maybe the general opinion is that this effort to credit OSM contributors exactly is needless anyway? Gestumblindi (talk)\n\nI think the OSM project should have invested more effort in correct attribution of the respective authors of map snippets. However, instead there is an ongoing effort to change the license of the OSM project licence change from CC-BY-SA 2.0 to ODbL 1.0. I think this will go hand in hand with an copyright assignment to the OSM Foundation, so perhaps individual attribution of mappers is on the way out, anyway. Greetings, Longbow4u (talk)\n\nProposal: move from one template to another in order to use the means of internationalization of the texts, as well as the automated recognition of parameters.Crochet.david (talk)\n\nDone Was in use on less than 10 pages. Replaced and deleted the template. Multichill (talk)\n\nfollowing the last community chat I finally got around to creating a new template for media which is illegal down here in Aus. (it's one of many of these tags).\n\nI dropped a note to a collaborator for feedback and a wee bit of help, but obviously timed it badly - D doesn't seem to be around this week. So I thought I'd swing by here for feedback, and to ask if someone might be interested in popping the template on media within Category:Erotic_activities_involving_children - which is a pretty clear application. I strongly agree with the commons practice of warning downstream users of their legal obligations, and advising them where accessing material may involve breaking local law. Privatemusings (talk)\n\nBe very careful with the 'illegal' language. We are no lawyers, so the category should be 'Possible illegal images in Australia'. That en:Child pornography laws in Australia article needs some serious work btw. Like it doesn't even refer to/name the actual laws themselves. I would also not call it a legal disclaimer, it is a warning. I'd start with the 'plain' reader targeted language, and end with referring to the specific Australian legal requirements. Would also be nice to refer to something that covers Australia (not just NSW). Possibly add that the materials are hosted in the US, subject to US law. TheDJ (talk)\n\nObviously feel free to dive in a make any changes you think would help, DJ, I think your points are good, so I'll try and incorporate them myself too.... btw. because we'd seek to cite a specific law, the template possibly should be called something like 'media which contravenes australian child pornography laws' - ie. there may be other material which is illegal for other reasons. That's a bit of a mouthful though, and maybe a bit incendiary, I dunno - any other ideas for the name? Privatemusings (talk)\n\nI would leave any \"legal disclaimers\" up to the Foundation's legal counsel. If we keep playing lawyer pretty soon every file will be marked with all kinds of dubious warnings based on what some non-lawyers interpreted the law to be. There's too many countries and too many laws. There's a reason why we say \"The laws in your country may not recognize as broad a protection of free speech as the laws of the United States or the principles under the UN Charter and, as such, Wikimedia Commons cannot be responsible for any potential violations of such laws should you link to this domain or use any of the information contained herein in anyway whatsoever.\" This is not our job. In fact, it may even be legally dangerous to do this. If we have all kinds of warnings, people will have reasonable expectation for us to warn them about all legal issues and when we fail to do that (which is inevitable with sheer amount of laws around the world and that fact that this is a user-generated site run by volunteers) and something happens to the unaware reuser, there can be lawsuits brought against the WMF. Of course, I'm no lawyer either but it doesn't sound like a good idea to me. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nWe should follow en:Wikipedia:No disclaimers in articles. Multichill (talk)\n\nI might be missing something about Australia, but I thought New South Wales was just one part of the country. Docu at\n\n< @multi - I think you're suggesting that these tags (used on lots and lots of images etc. currently) should probably be removed? - I don't agree, but I do think changing that practice probably warrants a bigger, broader discussion. @docu - yeah, NSW is one of the 8 states and territories of Oz, my reading of the paper linked in the template is that the other states share comparable language - perhaps that suffices, or perhaps we need to find more information? - thoughts? Privatemusings (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI'm looking for a software that can upload many files at the same time because I converted all the Diagrams of road signs of Belgium into SVG. I have 221 files and I don't want to import them manually one after the other. Is there an existing software to do that?\n\nThanks in advance Vascer (talk)\n\nCommons:Batch uploading is probably a good place to start. Multichill (talk)\n\nCommonist is quite nice for that. Amada44 talk to me\n\nThanks Amada44 for the application, now I'm going to ask for an AutoWikiBrowser account to change the licence of all files. Vascer (talk)\n\nI took this picture is Oslo of the last run of the wooden cars. File:Oslo Holmenkollbanen end 1.jpg Unfortunately I dont remember the date or year I took the picture and it is not marked on the slides. (I suspect late ninetees) I have some pictures from the same time, but I would like the date before I upload them. Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nPersonally I'd say what you provided for Oslo Holmenkollbanen seems good enough for our purposes, and similar should work for other images. Tabercil (talk)\n\nThe ticket machine in the background started deploying in January 1994, so it is definitely later than that. The last regular run of the wooden cars was 1995-03-02. However, the public could rent cars from the 600 series for several years after 1995, and the \"Turvogn\" designation suggests that the depicted car was not in ordinary traffic when you took the picture. I have tried searching Norwegian newspaper archives for more dates, but haven't been successful. Regards, --Kjetil_r\n\nThe Swedish Tramway Society has an entry on the OS 600 teak rolling stock. Unfortunately, it does not list a value for when they were taken out of service. However, the entries that are available for individual units (Hkb 604, 605, 609 and 611) all suggest that they were decommissioned in 1995. So perhaps {{other date|ca|1995}}? —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nCommons:Media of the day\n\nI think we have to talk about the missing MOTD templates this month. Some may think, we don't have enough media data in stack, and some may think that there is not put much emphasis creating a MOTD template. On the following days of July 2010, we did not have a MOTD template: 16 · 17 · 18· 23 · 26 · 27 · 28 · 29\n\nWhy is it like that? Maybe a lot of admins are on vacation ... (see also MOTD disc.) --Mattes (talk)\n\nOn the days there is no MOTD, it shouldn't really appear on Main Page (Talk:Main_Page#.22No_media_of_the_day_today.22_.282010-07-17.29). Unfortunately, the admins doing main page maintenance are on holidays too. Docu at\n\nMattes, the MOTD can be chosen by anyone. If you notice one is missing, you are very welcome to choose it. It's just like selecting a POTD from amongst the Featured Pictures. Docu, I personally don't mind showing the message \"There is no Media of the Day today.\" I think that will actually encourage people to find one. That's why I didn't respond to your request to hide it, but maybe another admin will. --99of9 (talk)\n\nHello 99of9, I really would like to create the templates (lots of ideas). But I'm not enabled to do so; they are editprotected. Except I was doing something wrong ... --Mattes (talk)\n\nTry adding one a few weeks in advance (just click on a redlink \"Choose a new media file\"). I'm not up on how cascading protection from the main page works, but I'm guessing it only applies near the day itself (perhaps this is the reason for the evidence Docu provides in the next point!). --99of9 (talk)\n\n99of9: apparently it didn't on 16 · 17 · 18· 23 · 26 · 27 · 28 · 29 -- Docu at\n\nThe encouragement was enough on the 19th and 31st. Obviously it doesn't force anyone to do anything! 99of9 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure if it's actually a good idea for the media of the day to be selected on the day. I think if these should remain on Main page, one should at least attempt to select them a few days before. Docu at\n\nThe ImageAnnotator gadget has recently been enabled on en.wikipedia for a trial. When I publicise this, people are bound to kvetch that doing so was a terrible crime laden with risk and woe. It'd like to be able to report that Commons users and admins found the gadget to be a net positive. So can I ask:\n\nwhen was ImageAnnotator enabled on Commons?\n\nhave there been significant technical problems with it?\n\nhas it been abused to a significant degree, and if so how?\n\nThanks. -- Finlay McWalter (talk)\n\nTo be honest, I found a rather annoying. Vere seldomly I see annotations, which actually provide additional info; And also that sentence \"this image contains annotations ...\" blows ups the size of |thumb| images too much--DieBuche (talk)\n\nSo far I've seen exactly one useful application of this feature, incidentally still present on this page at this moment. I have removed one irrelevant annotation from an image in the past (been a while, don't remember what it was). Other than that, the feature doesn't seem very popular. --Latebird (talk)\n\nHave a look at Category:Images with 10+ annotations. OTOH, I don't think that image annotations displayed on thumbnails are really that useful (at least not with the default size of thumbnails). As for abuse: there has been some in the past, mostly with annotations added by anonymous users (IMHO it was more a matter of silly notes than real vandalism, but that's just my impression, I have no numbers on this). Personally, I like them and use them to name places in panoramic photos and to link to other images displaying details (shameless plugs here and here). --Ianezz (talk)\n\nI found annotations useful when I uploaded this image [1] on Flickr. They are called \"notes\" on that site. SV1XV (talk)\n\nI don't remember when it was first enabled, but I remember that a lot of people were complaining it was mostly used inappropriately (putting the whole description of the image in a small image note at some random position), or for vandalism. At the time, I had a similar feeling, but I think this is bound to happen with new features; people will experiment with it, but when the novelty wears off, this kind of misuse tends to disappear. But you should expect some strong reactions against it at first; here, only a few weeks after it was introduced, a few people actually wanted the gadget to be disabled because they doubted it was a net positive for Commons.\n\nSo what about now? Regarding vandalism, from what I can see it's not really an issue anymore (no more than plain vandalism of the description page). But as you can see, some still think it's pretty much useless. I disagree with this assessment. People use it at COM:FPC to easily point out flaws in an image, and I find it quite useful for astronomical images, to indicate the name of the objects or link to other views on Commons. So definitely a net positive; maybe a small one, but positive nonetheless. –Tryphon☂\n\nI think it was added around June 2009. I find it very useful in specific cases, such as group pictures (example). The technical issues were ironed out a long time ago. I agree with Tryphon about the misuse. Pruneautalk\n\nPositive experience as far as I am concerned. I find this gadget quite useful, for instance to document images on geographical subjects (example), or to add located and precise textual notes (example). Per Tryphon, I also find interesting the possibility of embedded images in a main picture (example, see the annotation \"Uphill view towards this location a few months earlier\"). However, it's a pity that all these annotations are lost when one looks at an annotated image through most Wikipedias, as the gadget isn't emplemented there. --Myrabella (talk)\n\nLast time I checked Wikipedia was an encyclopedia, how ImageAnnotator fit into that? Shouldn't the images just be moved here so people can add notes? Multichill (talk)\n\nArticles in Wikipedia are often illustrated, aren't they? But if the reader of an article in Wikipedia clicks on an annotated image inserted in this article, he/she won't see the additional info given by these annotations: example. Some Wikipedias have implemented the gadget yet (hu:WP at least), and you can test it on en:WP for reader's experience: en:Help:Gadget-ImageAnnotator. --Myrabella (talk)\n\nI've seen it be used for QI candidates, to highlight areas which need fixing. Never used it myself. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nAs soon as Commons starts accepting fair use and US-only pictures, they can just move the images here.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nMy concern is not that WP users could add their own annotations directly in their home WP, but just that they can see annotations when these latter have been added on images uploaded in Commons. Anyway, that's not the matter—do you find the gadget useful for Commons images? --Myrabella (talk)\n\nYes I find it very useful. Much better than when people include in the image itself for example an arrow or text to explain something. Wouter (talk)\n\nPersonally I don't like annotations placed on images. They tend to cover up images and make them useless for many purposes (sample: File:View from Rosenhorn.jpg).\n\nImage annotator allows to do the same, but users only view them when they choose to do so by placing the mouse pointer over them image.\n\nCurrently most Wikipedia's lack support for users to read annotations at least on file description pages. I think this should be made available there as soon as possible. Docu at\n\nOakland A's baseball player Gabe Gross is a former quarterback for Auburn. My understanding of how the category system works is that the subject category for him can be categorized as such even though it currently doesn't have any media of him playing football at Auburn, because the lack of media here depicting him as such doesn't change the fact that he was an Auburn football player, and should be so categorized. Is this accurate? The closest thing I could find about this in the help pages is the first line of Commons:Categories#For more appropriate categorization, \"Pages (including category pages) are categorized according to their subject, and not to their contents, because the contents are generally not a permanent feature of the category page.\" UCinternational and me have a disagreement of whether or not to include this category, so I am seeking some clarification. BrokenSphere\n\nIf you had enough photographs of each, you could end up with subcategories for his baseball pics and his football pics. Do categories about people get subcategorised that way? Maybe you could add a text note on the category page that he was a football player, rather than use a category tag? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nNot sure about subcategorizing two-sport athletes by the respective sports they are depicted playing. I don't see the need to do this, now that you mention it.\n\nBasically I feel that the Auburn Tigers football players tag is more specific and descriptive than Alumni of Auburn University and not to categorize Gross as such is inaccurate, even though what is currently present only shows him playing baseball. BrokenSphere\n\nYes, if he was a Auburn football player, that would be an appropriate parent category for Ross. Commons:Categorization makes that pretty clear. Think of it another way...say a famous singer was a member of two well known bands, but for some reason images of him playing in one of those bands were not available. You wouldn't exclude that band as a parent category for this reason...he's still known for being a member of that band. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nDo you say it is appropriate that Category:Auburn Tigers football players is filled with photos of baseball players? --UCinternational (talk)\n\nIf those people are/were also Auburn football players, then of course. We also want off-field photos, etc., if we can get them, and they would also go there. Particularly in a category named for the person. The fact we have pictures of a person somewhere other than a football field does not change the fact that the person is or was an Auburn football player. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nLikewise, we have pictures of Barack Obama before he became President, but his category is still in Category:Presidents of the United States. Powers (talk)\n\nAuburn tigers should not include the category of any person, thats not hierarchical categorization and an common error in our category system. In 20 years the category will be blown up with 100rds of categories with 1000s of media files and the use of the categorization over time will inevitably go to zero and the number of media files that is realy related to Auburn Tigers will be much lower. This wrong categorization is avoidable in two ways: 1) split up player categories, example 'Gabe Gross playing for Auburn' and categorize this subcategories. That resolve most of the systematic problems and add an player only to the team/club he was playing for, but it will not increase the use of the Auburn tigers category and still the value of this category will decrase against zero over time. So 2) split the Auburn tigers category into seasons, this also allows further date or season categorization. I build an example in Category:Players of FC Bayern München, thats soccer but very similar. The navi bar in the 2009/2010 category was added to bring back the lost ability to navigate vertically through the player biography. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI find it hard to disagree more :-) Most certainly not an \"error\" at all. If we ever get enough photos, then certainly we should be able to subcategorize in more ways, and things like the above can be done. [And even your categories have off-field photos; which by your logic is incorrect.] Until enough images surface though, the current way is perfectly fine. I would think that given enough images, we would want to subcategorize both on seasons, *and* on overall, all-time names. It is not either/or. For similar reasons, Category:Iván Rodríguez is a subcat of all the baseball teams he has played for. If there are enough images which make team-specific subcats better for navigation, then of course. Often though people are trying to find pictures of a person in general, and different people will use different paths through the category system to find that -- no reason at all that the Auburn path is incorrect for Gross. If you really want to split categories up into \"Category:On-field Auburn football players\", and a \"Category:All-time Auburn football players\" to hold person categories, sure, go head. It is normally not an issue until we get enough images or subcats though, and those two types of categories are almost always combined, as splitting them usually feels like overcategorization. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nCategorizing players by their team/club is done on the English Wikipedia at least (I notice that the German Wiki may not do this). I also fail to see how Auburn Tigers football playes isn't hierarchical: it's a subcategory of Category:Auburn University athletics (though better suited to Auburn Tigers football), Category:College American football players, and Category:Alumni of Auburn University. At a glance this category helps me see who do we have media for in Commons who ever played football at Auburn.\n\nI also see a couple issues with categorizing players by year as with the FC Bayern München example:\n\nWhat if a player is with the club for several years? If they're with the club for 5 years this spreads images of them out over 5 categories vs. collecting it into one that is specific to them. I think this then actually makes it harder for people to find what they're looking for because then they have to research when did X play for FC Bayern München and look across all the categories that he was with the club, and even then they may not find what they're looking for. If there are many images of one person in a specific year, then a John Doe in 200X as a person subcategory can be created.\n\nWhy not create season-specific categories for the club as a whole? E.g. 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season, which is also an existing article. The category can now link back to that article.\n\nBrokenSphere\n\nIn my opinion, the approach mentioned above contains serious problems. If we have a photo of a player in each club he played for (at least one photo a season), it would work (however, it would be rather difficult to find the necessary player if photos do not have good names). If a player was not pictured at least during one season of his career, this approach would fail. Commons' categories are to help people find images by any relevant criteria. People looking for pictures of the players of some club are not supposed to look for the players in exactly that club. If a person wants to find, say, pictures of the most notable players of some small club, he/she will most likely search in the category of the players of this club, but a player of some most famous players in the national team will normally be OK. Moreover, if a player spent two or more seasons in the club, but there are photos of only one season, aren't they good enough to illustrate player in that club, or does season matter that much? As for me, if I want to find a photo of a player in some club, it's not important in what year it was taken. Off-field pictures of players, photos of players in national teams and pictures of retired players are another problem. And finally, it's much easier to find the player while looking through the list of subcategories then by searching in the gallery for the photos which may have not very good names (as player's subcategories are not supposed to be categorised to players' categories). In other words, it is important to categorise players' categories to all categories their subject played for, as it helps make search easier. Creating two categories, one by season, another one for all-time players may be a good solution, another option is a gallery for team's pictures season by season, like History of Auburn Tigers with subsections for each season. Removing categories of clubs a player played for, but was not pictured while playing for, will significantly decrease usability of these categories — NickK (talk)\n\nAugust 1\n\nI wanted to create a category page for Sándor Bródy (Hungarian writer), but I made a simple Sándor Bródy page instead.

When I am at Wikipedia and I click a wikilink to Commons, I am automatically logged in to my unified account at Commons. But when I go from Commons back to Wikipedia I lose the secure connection (i.e. it goes from an HTTPS connection to HTTP). For example, if I add a wikilink from here to Wikipedia's main page using [[w:Main page]] like this w:Main page, the wikilink is an HTTP link instead of HTTPS. Is there a way to make a wikilink stay secure (i.e. maintain the HTTPS connection). Thanks for any help. - Hydroxonium (talk)\n\nI can reproduce the problem. I remember the same issue was fixed at de.wikipedia some weeks ago: de:Wikipedia:Fragen_zur_Wikipedia/Archiv/2010/Woche_04#Secure-WP_und_Interwikilinks. The mediawiki config needs to be changed - I have asked de:User:Merlissimo if he could do the same here - or give hints how to do it. Probably you could also write a hack in your monobook.js to replace all http://xx.wikipedia.org links by their HTTPS equivalent. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nThanks for the reply, Saibo. I just noticed that when I go to the Wikipedia login page and click the link for the secure server, I am transferred from en.wikipedia.org to secure.wikimedia.org. If I then go a category, such as w:Category:Insects and click the \"Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Insecta\" link, then I am still at secure.wikimedia.org as opposed to commons.wikimedia.org. I am certain that's why I was automatically logged in to Commons.\n\nI ran some tests and this seems to be an issue for all the interwiki links. I ran a test on Wikipedia and created the wikilink [[commons:Category:Insecta]], and again I was taken from the secure server to the regular one. Please note that the commons wikilink does not work here at Commons, only over at Wikipedia.\n\nI am not too concerned about myself, but I'm thinking this could be a security issue for others, such as people in China or other parts of the world.

I do know that some work is being doing on the interwiki system at the moment, but I doubt that is enough to fix this. The biggest problem is that mediawiki currently doesn't really 'know' the secure version of an interwiki link. It only know it's 'own' form (secure or otherwise).

I am aware there is some controversy here about what is pornography and what is educational, but I have also raised the issue of several images which appear to have been taken within minutes of each other but seem to serve little use other than to show young women nude. I have nominated several photographs for deletion based on this reasoning, that there is no educational use for so many pornographic photographs, only to be slapped down by a small group of like-minded users who consider it to be an 'attack' on this site. What, for example, does this image achieve: File:Sabrina Deep adjusted.jpg? Or this: File:Kelly Madison 3.JPG? How can this image be educational: File:Demi Delia 1.JPG? Or these two photographs File:Angelina Ash 3.jpg and File:Angelina Ash 4.jpg which only appear to differ based on the amount of whipped cream on the body of the woman.\n\nWikimedia Commons needs to have a good long think about what is available on the site. I'm not attacking it, but I believe there should be some kind of effort to clean it up to return to the true educational purpose it was set up for. The Cleaner (talk)\n\nIn general, each of those images is useful for illustrating the work of a notable pornographic model or actress. Images such as the Angelina Ash series are also useful for illustrating specific fetishes. Powers (talk)\n\nAccording to Commons:Nudity: \"If a new image depicts something we already have an image of, but in a better way, the older image may be considered for deletion.\" Kaldari (talk)\n\nOkay... and? Powers (talk)\n\nkuch..... (can the real puppeteer stand up now!). Multichill (talk)\n\nPuppeteer? The Cleaner (talk)\n\nPlease note that Wikimedia Commons is supposed to serve as a common repository of images for all the Wikipedias. It's not this site's place to be telling en.wikipedia that it can't have articles on these four women, or at least, that they can't illustrate them. There are scope restrictions that would affect the pictures if they were just uploads of random amply proportioned women with no particular point (i.e. \"snapshots of yourself and your friends\" are unwanted). Wnt (talk)\n\nI agree entirely with the quote from Kaldari above: \"If a new image depicts something we already have an image of, but in a better way, the older image may be considered for deletion.\" (even if the images are considered educational, and I don't personally think they are, we should really choose just one of the whipped cream ones and discard the other one, or better still, look for the perfect image that depicts this in a tasteful way, which is possible). The trouble with this is who decides what is \"better\" or \"different\"? It only takes a bit of imagination to see that this doesn't really limit anything. My view is that in paper encyclopedias and reference works, people were limited by paper and money, and were forced to select the best and most relevant images, as well as adhere to well-defined editorial standards, and discard (or archive) the rest. In an online encyclopedia, these restraints don't exist, but we should show some restraint (this is not censorship, just common sense) and try and ensure such images are used, not just placed here for people to browse. It is relatively easy to measure and track the use of images in the projects that Commons serves, but it is less easy to measure the use of pictures that people view by clicking things like the \"Commons category\" or \"Commons page\" links on WMF projects. It is also harder to assess the use by non-WMF projects (i.e. the role Commons plays as a freely licensed image depository for the whole world, something I think that goes far outside the realistic aims of the WMF mission). There are some models where it makes sense to have millions of images with only a small percentage actually used, but I don't think that model is sustainable for Commons. Something radical, like flagging up images that are not used in any projects after being here a year, is needed, with projects being asked to link to Commons gallery pages rather than categories (as a better way to track use of images that projects want to link to). There is also a specific problem with one of the images, but I'll flag that up below in a subsection. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nI concur. Although I don't know the current technical limitation of the WMF, it's conceivable that things could get out of hand very quickly. Who would be the one to handle a cleanup script for old orphaned files? Micahmedia (talk)\n\nA site in which images were deleted if not used in any Wikipedia article for a year would be a very different site than Commons now is. It would decimate the \"Tree of Life\" project, for one thing (and encourage manipulation of Wikipedia articles). Who is supposed to go through two million files that have been \"flagged by a script\" anyway? AnonMoos (talk)\n\nThe idea is that the software would do this automagically to all images (images that had never been used at all would be marked as such in some way and appear different when viewed on Commons). Generally speaking, it would be nicer if it was easier to see which images are in use or not. Categories are a poor way of organising images, especially when you have categories with hundreds of images. Categories only really work if you have efficient subcategorisation. The classic signs of areas of Commons ending up as a dump of unused and unorganised images is categories with hundreds of images in them with no discernable order to them. I spent an evening going through Category:Maker Faire 2008, and it was difficult to see which ones were in use on other projects, and which ones were sitting there uselessly (some lacked basic information that would be needed to use them in any useful way). Is there a tool that lets you see how images in a category are being used? And is there a way to tell if an image is being used in the \"Tree of Life\" project? Oh, and I've looked again at the two \"whipped cream\" images and I think only one of them is needed - would I nominate them both for deletion to see which one should be kept? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nYou can use the GLAMorous tool. A photo that is not used today doesn't mean it will not be used tomorrow. Okki (talk)\n\nA specific tool for a specific purpose is more likely than radically changing the basic nature of the site... AnonMoos (talk)\n\nOTRS permission confusion?\n\nCould someone check whether the OTRS permission for File:Sabrina Deep adjusted.jpg is for the cropped version File:Gram4.jpg, as it seems that the \"adjustment\" here was to resurrect the uncropped version. Is it acceptable to do this without checking with OTRS? Note that the cropping occurred immediately after upload of File:Gram4.jpg. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk) 08:07, 30 July 2010 (UTC) I have asked this question at Commons:OTRS/Noticeboard (which I have only just found) instead. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nIf we have an image, say, of 12 megapixels, a thumbnail will hide small details. Do you distinguish any face on this picture? Do you even see a notebook? Doubtful. Let us suppose that we interest only in its part about 1000×800 pixles. Of course, we could crop the file offline and upload a cropped version, but this have many disadvantages. Alternatively, we can use some tricks (see and discuss the test page) to show only relevant part of an image. I am not a Web designer, my interest are far from this, hence I ask somebody to develop it. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nHiding parts with css isn't that good of an idea, since we load the whle image anyway. Best imho, would be to do it via imagemagick, but you should really rather file a bug at bugzilla--DieBuche (talk)\n\nDo you propose some extra parameters for [[Image:…]] tag, to crop an image via MediaWiki? IMHO the server side will unlikely be upgraded soon to allow this, and some usable solution for wiki users (not necessary really useful) would help to estimate the need and make the change request better. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nYes, that is a far better solution than using CSS. It is discussed in bugzilla:7757. TheDJ (talk)\n\nI agree that MediaWiki should be able to crop, I surprised that this was proposed as early as in 2006 with no progress in 4 years. But now, we can make a template currently using CSS like {{Wide image}}, but later to change the implementation to server side cropping. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nHow would this work when a downstream user tries to copy the page and include images? Will they be able to include the image the same way or will this function break for them? What about someone who tries to print an article or other item that includes the image cropped in wikitext? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nFrom the image cleanup perspective, it's quite annoying when I have to clean up the original image as well as 2-20 detail images of various portions of the image by re-cropping them from the cleaned-up original image. Worse yet is when somebody just plain doesn't bother to do this. A crop feature in the image syntax could help avoid this problem. On the other hand, images are often modified during cropping (e.g. to adjust levels), and in this case this syntax would not be helpful. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nThe big problem with any cropping syntax, is how much it relies on the original. If someone changes the dimensions or aspect ratio of the original image, all your cropped image transclusions go potentially bust. We need a better in browser crop + derivative tracking system. I think that is the better approach. TheDJ (talk)\n\nJust an idea: If a crop via cropping syntax would be possible it should probably refer to an image version in the syntax. This would prevent \"bust\"s. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nThe same \"problem\" does occur with the image annotations (section right below), doesn't it? --Saibo (Δ)\n\nAnyone minds me adding it?

Rama (talk)\n\nWhile I thought to be registering at en.wikipedia, it turns out I have registered myself twice at wikimedia commons.

Thank you for your time...--Williwaw10 (talk)\n\nWe can't delete accounts, what I could offer you though, is to redirect your old one to the new one.--DieBuche (talk)\n\nCan you also redirect the nwew one to the old?

It might be helpful if you visit Special:MergeAccount to unify your nl & commons \"williwaw\" account--DieBuche (talk)\n\nMy \"nominate for deletion\" toolbox entry is gone. Why? --ALE! ¿…?\n\nWhich skin & browser are you using?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nI noticed you still link MediaWiki talk:Quick-delete.js in your monobook.js, but the script has been moved elsewhere. Perhaps this has something to do with your problem? --Ianezz (talk)\n\nNo, it does not as I changed to the new skript and still do not see the \"nomination\" button. --ALE! ¿…?\n\nNot sure if this is the problem that you're seeing, but this was the case for me anyway: The Quick Delete gadget was recently switched to a new version of the script, which can be found at MediaWiki:AjaxQuickDelete.js. As discussed at MediaWiki talk:AjaxQuickDelete.js#Missing links on some images?, the deletion toolbox entries are not available for files that already have problem tags. I guess we haven't decided if this is a bug or a feature yet. :) If you click on edit, the links appear. —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nThis is also not the problem as I wanted to nominate File:Ep-straatsburg.jpg which does not have a problem tag. --ALE! ¿…?\n\nI seem to have a similar problem, as I said below. I'm using Chromium with the Monobook skin, and trying with the image above, the links show up the first time, but then disappear. Clicking edit shows the links again. I also noticed now that if I reload the page several times, they reappear eventually, but then go away again and so on. There doesn't seem to be any pattern for this behavior. –Tryphon☂\n\nLooking into it now. @ALE! are you using Chrome or Chromium as well? @Tryphon, Could I get OS and exact version number?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nOk, found the caveat. I'll fix in one sec--DieBuche (talk)\n\nDone. It's a known problem with webkit browsers (their JS execution is too fast, so they try using addToolLink before the function is even retrieved from the cache). Fixed now. (Clean you cache in Chrome using the \"under the hood\" pref pane). ALE!, could you confirm?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nWell, but I am using IE7. The problem is not fixed for me. --ALE! ¿…?\n\nNormally I would say you should get a working browser, but today I feel like fixing funky MSIE bugs, so here you go ;). You need to go to \"internet options\" & delete \"temporary files\"--DieBuche (talk)\n\nNot in all environments one is free to choose the browser. Thank you! It seems to work now. --ALE! ¿…?\n\nYep, that was it! Working perfectly for me now, thanks! –Tryphon☂\n\nNeed your guys opinion: Would you rather have the tags signed by --~~~~ or by ~~~~ (without dashes) ? --DieBuche (talk)\n\nWithout dashes. If someone wants to systematically add dashes before their signature, they can customize it in the preferences. But if you don't want the dashes, and they're added by default, there's nothing you can do (or is there?) –Tryphon☂\n\nI also prefer without en dashes (as I have a custom em dash in my signature), but I lost the argument at Template talk:Delete#Why_have_the_--_been_added.3F. — Jeff G. ツ\n\nI would also not put the \"--\" directly in there. If someone wants them, they can still write \"Reason for deletion. --\" and have them there. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nAh, sorry, forgot to update here: the dashes are gone since a few days ago; if you still get them, you'll need to clear your cache--DieBuche (talk)\n\nI have concerns I would like to raise about some of the photographs on this website. I am aware there is some controversy here about what is pornography and what is educational, but I have also raised the issue of several images which appear to have been taken within minutes of each other but seem to serve little use other than to show young women nude. I have nominated several photographs for deletion based on this reasoning, that there is no educational use for so many pornographic photographs, only to be slapped down by a small group of like-minded users who consider it to be an 'attack' on this site. What, for example, does this image achieve: File:Sabrina Deep adjusted.jpg? Or this: File:Kelly Madison 3.JPG? How can this image be educational: File:Demi Delia 1.JPG? Or these two photographs File:Angelina Ash 3.jpg and File:Angelina Ash 4.jpg which only appear to differ based on the amount of whipped cream on the body of the woman.\n\nWikimedia Commons needs to have a good long think about what is available on the site. I'm not attacking it, but I believe there should be some kind of effort to clean it up to return to the true educational purpose it was set up for. The Cleaner (talk)\n\nIn general, each of those images is useful for illustrating the work of a notable pornographic model or actress. Images such as the Angelina Ash series are also useful for illustrating specific fetishes. Powers (talk)\n\nAccording to Commons:Nudity: \"If a new image depicts something we already have an image of, but in a better way, the older image may be considered for deletion.\" Kaldari (talk)\n\nOkay... and? Powers (talk)\n\nkuch..... (can the real puppeteer stand up now!). Multichill (talk)\n\nPuppeteer? The Cleaner (talk)\n\nPlease note that Wikimedia Commons is supposed to serve as a common repository of images for all the Wikipedias. It's not this site's place to be telling en.wikipedia that it can't have articles on these four women, or at least, that they can't illustrate them. There are scope restrictions that would affect the pictures if they were just uploads of random amply proportioned women with no particular point (i.e. \"snapshots of yourself and your friends\" are unwanted). Wnt (talk)\n\nI agree entirely with the quote from Kaldari above: \"If a new image depicts something we already have an image of, but in a better way, the older image may be considered for deletion.\" (even if the images are considered educational, and I don't personally think they are, we should really choose just one of the whipped cream ones and discard the other one, or better still, look for the perfect image that depicts this in a tasteful way, which is possible). The trouble with this is who decides what is \"better\" or \"different\"? It only takes a bit of imagination to see that this doesn't really limit anything. My view is that in paper encyclopedias and reference works, people were limited by paper and money, and were forced to select the best and most relevant images, as well as adhere to well-defined editorial standards, and discard (or archive) the rest. In an online encyclopedia, these restraints don't exist, but we should show some restraint (this is not censorship, just common sense) and try and ensure such images are used, not just placed here for people to browse. It is relatively easy to measure and track the use of images in the projects that Commons serves, but it is less easy to measure the use of pictures that people view by clicking things like the \"Commons category\" or \"Commons page\" links on WMF projects. It is also harder to assess the use by non-WMF projects (i.e. the role Commons plays as a freely licensed image depository for the whole world, something I think that goes far outside the realistic aims of the WMF mission). There are some models where it makes sense to have millions of images with only a small percentage actually used, but I don't think that model is sustainable for Commons. Something radical, like flagging up images that are not used in any projects after being here a year, is needed, with projects being asked to link to Commons gallery pages rather than categories (as a better way to track use of images that projects want to link to). There is also a specific problem with one of the images, but I'll flag that up below in a subsection. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nI concur. Although I don't know the current technical limitation of the WMF, it's conceivable that things could get out of hand very quickly. Who would be the one to handle a cleanup script for old orphaned files? Micahmedia (talk)\n\nA site in which images were deleted if not used in any Wikipedia article for a year would be a very different site than Commons now is. It would decimate the \"Tree of Life\" project, for one thing (and encourage manipulation of Wikipedia articles). Who is supposed to go through two million files that have been \"flagged by a script\" anyway? AnonMoos (talk)\n\nThe idea is that the software would do this automagically to all images (images that had never been used at all would be marked as such in some way and appear different when viewed on Commons). Generally speaking, it would be nicer if it was easier to see which images are in use or not. Categories are a poor way of organising images, especially when you have categories with hundreds of images. Categories only really work if you have efficient subcategorisation. The classic signs of areas of Commons ending up as a dump of unused and unorganised images is categories with hundreds of images in them with no discernable order to them. I spent an evening going through Category:Maker Faire 2008, and it was difficult to see which ones were in use on other projects, and which ones were sitting there uselessly (some lacked basic information that would be needed to use them in any useful way). Is there a tool that lets you see how images in a category are being used? And is there a way to tell if an image is being used in the \"Tree of Life\" project? Oh, and I've looked again at the two \"whipped cream\" images and I think only one of them is needed - would I nominate them both for deletion to see which one should be kept? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nYou can use the GLAMorous tool. A photo that is not used today doesn't mean it will not be used tomorrow. Okki (talk)\n\nA specific tool for a specific purpose is more likely than radically changing the basic nature of the site... AnonMoos (talk)\n\nOTRS permission confusion?\n\nCould someone check whether the OTRS permission for File:Sabrina Deep adjusted.jpg is for the cropped version File:Gram4.jpg, as it seems that the \"adjustment\" here was to resurrect the uncropped version. Is it acceptable to do this without checking with OTRS? Note that the cropping occurred immediately after upload of File:Gram4.jpg. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk) 08:07, 30 July 2010 (UTC) I have asked this question at Commons:OTRS/Noticeboard (which I have only just found) instead. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nIf we have an image, say, of 12 megapixels, a thumbnail will hide small details. Do you distinguish any face on this picture? Do you even see a notebook? Doubtful. Let us suppose that we interest only in its part about 1000×800 pixles. Of course, we could crop the file offline and upload a cropped version, but this have many disadvantages. Alternatively, we can use some tricks (see and discuss the test page) to show only relevant part of an image. I am not a Web designer, my interest are far from this, hence I ask somebody to develop it. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nHiding parts with css isn't that good of an idea, since we load the whle image anyway. Best imho, would be to do it via imagemagick, but you should really rather file a bug at bugzilla--DieBuche (talk)\n\nDo you propose some extra parameters for [[Image:…]] tag, to crop an image via MediaWiki? IMHO the server side will unlikely be upgraded soon to allow this, and some usable solution for wiki users (not necessary really useful) would help to estimate the need and make the change request better. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nYes, that is a far better solution than using CSS. It is discussed in bugzilla:7757. TheDJ (talk)\n\nI agree that MediaWiki should be able to crop, I surprised that this was proposed as early as in 2006 with no progress in 4 years. But now, we can make a template currently using CSS like {{Wide image}}, but later to change the implementation to server side cropping. Incnis Mrsi (talk)\n\nHow would this work when a downstream user tries to copy the page and include images? Will they be able to include the image the same way or will this function break for them? What about someone who tries to print an article or other item that includes the image cropped in wikitext? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nFrom the image cleanup perspective, it's quite annoying when I have to clean up the original image as well as 2-20 detail images of various portions of the image by re-cropping them from the cleaned-up original image. Worse yet is when somebody just plain doesn't bother to do this. A crop feature in the image syntax could help avoid this problem. On the other hand, images are often modified during cropping (e.g. to adjust levels), and in this case this syntax would not be helpful. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nThe big problem with any cropping syntax, is how much it relies on the original. If someone changes the dimensions or aspect ratio of the original image, all your cropped image transclusions go potentially bust. We need a better in browser crop + derivative tracking system. I think that is the better approach. TheDJ (talk)\n\nJust an idea: If a crop via cropping syntax would be possible it should probably refer to an image version in the syntax. This would prevent \"bust\"s. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nThe same \"problem\" does occur with the image annotations (section right below), doesn't it? --Saibo (Δ)\n\nAnyone minds me adding it? This would enable gadgets to actually use it, right now we can't or if we do, we have to code a non jQuery replacement for older skins as well, which in turn makes using jquery more complicated than not using it.--DieBuche (talk)\n\nComment In the next revision or so of MediaWiki, it will be available to all skins on all pages anyway. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nSweet. I don't need it right now anyway. Do you now which rev / bug it is?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nSee mw:Manual:$wgJQueryOnEveryPage and rev:r65962. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nThis probably won't happen until the new resourceloader is finished, and I have to say, that thing is gonna be awesome. It has everything you can ever want. On the fly minifying, debug modes, bundling, caching, localization and versioning, it's gonna be the holy grail of efficient, yet non-static, JS and CSS delivery. I can't wait. TheDJ (talk)\n\nFresh from the press: If you clear your cache, you should now see a \"Move page and replace usage\" button on every {{Rename}}. Clicking it confirms the name and reason & then moves the file, notifies CommonsDelinker and removes the, then redundant, {{Rename}} template. Also some rather rare bugs with the \"nominate for deletion\" script are fixed (231 & spamblacklist). --DieBuche (talk)\n\nW00t, that is gonna be soooo useful. TheDJ (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to work for my Safari... :( TheDJ (talk)\n\nWeird, I'm developing in Safari. What (and on which image) exactly happens? Do you see the green link in the template? Could you right-click on the page, select \"inspect element\" & and in the new window go to the console tab: Any errors reported?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nI found a bug: I could not move the file (because I'm not an admin), but the script did remove the template from the description page. - Erik Baas (talk)\n\nHow did you manage to see the link? Anyway, fixed, i forgot to return; after displaying the warning message--DieBuche (talk)\n\nUsing \"EditCSS\" (a Firefox plug-in) I added div {display:block!important;} to the stylesheets. - Erik Baas (talk)\n\nThe \"Move page and replace usage\" button is not working for me. It gives me the error message \"An error occurred while nominating the file for deletion. To nominate this file for deletion, please edit the page to add the {{Delete}} template and follow the instructions shown on it. A detailed description of the error is shown below: API request failed (editconflict): Edit conflict detected.\" After refreshing the page following the error, I notice that the rename has taken place, but do not know if articles using the old filename have been updated.

I found it on flickr, where it was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 1.0 Generic license. However, I have a bad feeling about it. Can someone check it? Surtsicna (talk)\n\nThere is a lot of compression issues. Looks like a frame from a digital movie. Looking at other images in the same set, my suspicions seem to be confirmed: \"Crown Princess Victoria marries her Prince, Daniel Westling in Storkyrkan, Sweden 2010_06_19. SVT1 webb image.

Note that other photographs by this photographer are collected in this category. TheDJ (talk)\n\nI'd say just those images from inside the chapel are problematic regarding the wedding.

People get use to a certain interface and want things they click on always in the same place (especially if you got them mapped out in your mind and use them almost without thinking; a minor change throws you off). Adding a button or two or replacing something like #REDIRECT with {{category redirect}} (great idea, btw) is fine but please don't change it anymore than that from one namespace to another. I also don't think we should be encouraging things like {{Outdent}} (which isn't common enough to be put in here). I removed the \"no reason\"s because they just take up room (and are monolingual).

You have to know what you're doing to legally upload someone else's work.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nFor my own stuff, I'm okay. But sometimes I have probs even with US fed gov images, because they are loaned from somewhere else. Drives me batty. Thanks though. Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nAugust 9\n\nIt really irks me when commons asks me e.g. if I wanted to search for Frank Lappa when I search for Frank Zappa and when I then click the suggested Frank Lappa search, it produces zero results. Could the suggest feature be so improved that it wouldn't suggest searches with zero results? I mean, that'd be wonderful and save us all some time. Thanks, bye! 85.76.37.50\n\nI think that uses Google's suggestion service, which we don't have much control over. Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nWe do not use Google's suggestion services, nor does any part of our search has anything to do with Google. Search suggestions sometimes suggest stuff that yield zero results. The main reason for this is that we don't have enough servers to run each query twice - once for what you typed it, and once for the search suggestion. Thus, we rely on our search suggestions to get things mostly right, which sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. Unfortunately, there is currently no-one working on this due to shortage of volunteers, and we do not have funds for additional servers. --mw:User:Rainman\n\nI noticed this BBC news story today (though I had seen the news earlier somewhere else): Wikipedia and FBI in logo use row. As the image is hosted here on Commons, I thought it would be a good idea to flag up the story so people here are aware of it (though I'm sure many people have already seen the story). It might also be worth discussing whether this affects any other similar images or not (what applies for similar logos in other countries, for example). Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nConsidering Godwin wrote back and said \"you're wrong\", I don't think we need to do anything. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nBut it was worth flagging up the story? I thought it was interesting. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nI found Mike's letter pretty hilarious. --DieBuche (talk)\n\nIt was funny, wasn't it. :-) I didn't quite understand all of it though. I was hoping someone could also explain in slightly less legal terms what the argument was about, and what exactly you are allowed to do with the FBI logo image (there seems to be a disclaimer on the current image restricting how it can be reused). File:US-FBI-ShadedSeal.svg: \"Public domain from a copyright standpoint, but other restrictions apply. In the US, unauthorized use of the FBI seal, name, and initials are subject to prosecution under Federal Criminal law, including 18 U.S.C § 701, § 709, and § 712.\" also \"This image shows a flag, a coat of arms, a seal or some other official insignia. The use of such symbols is restricted in many countries. These restrictions are independent of the copyright status.\" Is the bit about \"restrictions independent of the copyright status\" similar to the way in which personality rights restrict the reuse of some images, but doesn't affect how \"free\" an image is? So are you allowed to modify the FBI logo and/or print it on a T-shirt or something, or could that get you in trouble in the US? Also, some of the files don't have those tags on them: File:FBI seal.svg, File:FBI seal.png, File:FBISeal.png. Should all those have the same tags on them? And what about this image: File:FBI Badge.jpg? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nIn the language of Commons this is a non-copyright restriction, like trademarks, since it does not restrict distribution or derivative works, only how a work may be reused in certain limited contexts outside of WMF projects. The situation is very similar to currency (Commons:Currency), which is mostly PD in the US but subject to counterfeiting legislation. We may choose to add a warning to the file description page, as we do for several other types, but I don't personally think it'd be very useful in this case. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nGot it now (I think). That page was helpful, thanks. The analogy with currency counterfeiting seems the right one to make here. I noticed that a {{Counterfeiting}} tag exists and some currencies have restrictions on resolutions. I suppose it is possible that a case could be made for tagging and/or limiting the resolution of the image of the FBI logo, but if things change and anything like that needs doing, I guess we would be told. Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nThe SVG version of the FBI seal has the {{Insignia}} template, which seems more than enough to me. If we have to make specialized templates for every insignia/seal/coa/medal then we will have more of them than we can manage. For the SVG, the specific law is even mentioned in the Permission field. TheDJ (talk)\n\n@Carcharoth: Regarding the mike's legal argument: The FBI actually misquoted one law \"Whoever manufactures, sells, or possesses any badge, identification card, or other insignia\" to \"Whoever manufactures, sells, or possesses insignia\" but according to some principle called ejusdem generis the \"other insignia\" part is only meant to clarify the previous list, \"where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\" See the full letter here--DieBuche (talk)\n\nWikipedia has an article on that: en:Ejusdem generis. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nI hope it is acceptable (since it is relevant to this discussion) to mention this deletion discussion here. One question I do have is whether (because the argument being proposed for deletion has changed since the start of the discussion) it is acceptable to restart the discussion with the (IMO) more valid reason for deletion, or to point out the later reason to those who commented early on in the discussion? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nQ1: Can users transfer files from Commons to Wikipedia without downloading and re-uploading? Q2: Can admins transfer files from Commons to Wikipedia without... etc...? --Nepenthes (talk)\n\nYes & yes. I guess this is for unfree files. Use imagetransfer.py (part of pywikipedia). Multichill (talk)\n\nHow does one use pywikipedia? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nInstall python (google it); download pywikipedia; cd into the directory; use like\n\npython imagetransfer.py -Arguments\n\n--DieBuche (talk)\n\nJust use CommonsHelper and tick the \"from commons to project\" box--DieBuche (talk)\n\nAh, I think I'll just do that as I'm familiar with CommonsHelper. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThanks Jack for asking my questions ;) (I had the same anyway...). I tried the CommonsHelper now - however, it does not work without downloading and re-uploading the file. Python I don't want to install as I only have 20 or 30 pics to transfer. Somebody willing to do that for me? (from Commons to WPde because of FOP issue in the United Arab Emirates). I would post a big \"You are my hero\" on the disc page in return... haha... Thanks --Nepenthes (talk)\n\nWhat about CommonsHelper2? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nIt probably works without down-up-loading if (and only if) you enter your TUSC accout for de.wikipedia. Are these pics going to be deleted on Commons? Viele Grüße --Saibo (Δ)\n\nHmm, I used CommonsHelper2 and also the TUSC account. But still it tells me: \"ATTENTION : Direct upload works only at commons!\". So it looks like it only works the other way round...? Yes, Saibo, these pics are going to be deleted on Commons and actually some of them were already deleted. I included now a list of all pics that I would like to transfer from Commons to WP de (all these pics are allowed on WP de but not on Commons due to FOP):\n\nFile:Yas Marina Hotel 001.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Hotel 002.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Hotel 003.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Hotel 004.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Hotel 005.jpg\n\nFile:The Landmark Abu Dhabi 001.jpg\n\nFile:Etihad Towers 002.jpg\n\nFile:Trust Tower Abu Dhabi 001.jpg\n\nFile:Etihad Towers.JPG\n\nFile:Capital Plaza Abu Dhabi 001.jpg\n\nFile:Sun Tower and Sky Tower Abu Dhabi.JPG\n\nFile:Capital Gate Abu Dhabi 001.JPG\n\nFile:The Address 001.jpg\n\nFile:Rose Tower 002.JPG\n\nFile:Rose Tower 001.JPG\n\nFile:Burj Khalifa 005.JPG\n\nFile:Burj Dubai 001.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Circuit 003.JPG\n\nFile:Metro Dubai 003.jpg\n\nFile:Metro Dubai 002.jpg\n\nFile:Metro Dubai 001.jpg\n\nFile:Business Bay Dubai.JPG\n\nFile:Shaikh Khalifa Medical City.jpg\n\nFile:Catholic church in Dubai.jpg\n\nFile:Evangelical church in Dubai.jpg\n\nFile:Dubai Metro train.jpg\n\nFile:Yas Marina Circuit 002.JPG\n\nFile:Yas Marina Circuit 001.JPG\n\nFile:Ferrari World June 2009.JPG\n\nFile:Atlantis Dubai.JPG\n\nFile:ADMA-OPCO long shot (Nepenthes).jpg\n\nFile:Royal Meridien Abu Dhabi (Nepenthes).jpg\n\nFile:ADMA-OPCO close (Nepenthes).jpg\n\nFile:ADMA-OPCO (Nepenthes).jpg\n\nFile:Saadiyat Bridge (Nepenthes).jpg\n\nFile:Sheikh Zayed Mosque.jpg\n\nSome of the pics were already deleted due to FOP:\n\nFile:BurjDubai.jpg\n\nFile:The Index 001.JPG\n\nFile:EmiratesTowers.jpg\n\nFile:Almas Tower.jpg\n\nFile:Burj Khalifa 002.JPG\n\nFile:Burj Khalifa 003.JPG\n\nFile:Burj Khalifa 004.JPG\n\nFile:Burj Khalifa 006.jpg\n\nMaybe somebody could help...? ;) --Nepenthes (talk)\n\nSorry. Of course, if the tool says that TUSC does not work the opposite direction it is like it is. I will help transferring. Please strike (<s>File:foobar</s>) the file's already transferred. Should we upload using the same name? Inclusions in the de.wiki will then automatically use the de.wiki version. Probably not the best thing if not all files here get deleted. Viele Grüße --Saibo (Δ)\n\nAre you able to transfer without down/re-uploading? Btw, are you admin on Commons? Because then you could directly delete the file after transferring? If not, it would be great if you could just transfer with the same file name. So once a file will be deleted on Commons, the same file on WP-de will be used. I can take care of proper file description and tagging after transfer. Thanks Saibo! --Nepenthes (talk)\n\nNo I am not able to transfer without down/re-uploading. I am not an admin on Commons. Why should the files be deleted if no deletion request has been opened against the file. Even if there is no FOP in UAE - do all these buildings exceed the de:Schöpfungshöhe in UAE? The same file name would be good if all files on COM get deleted - but if not it wouldn't be good. Well, let's use the same file name. If the outcome is that some files on COM won't be deleted their copy on dewiki could be simply deleted then. I will start to transfer probably in about four hours starting at the bottom of the list and strike those transferred. Viele Grüße --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI tried the first one. The problem is that Commonshelper 2 does not translate the info template. The whole description needs to be filled in manually. I will not transfer any file for now. Maybe somebody has a better idea. Probably someone used to use the pyton script imagetransfer.py could transfer them. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI also tried now with manual down- and re-upload but it's a real nightmare with the file descriptions. Everything needs to be changed manually. Why I want them to be deleted and transferred? Because every once in a while somebody will delete one of these files anyway (see end of my list the deleted ones which I cannot access anymore). So after some months I assume all of the others will be gone also therefore I wanted to rescue them before all are lost. --Nepenthes (talk)\n\nI just read: Commons:Deletion requests/Images of Category:Burj Khalifa. Well, maybe someone with the above mentioned skript (m:Pywikipediabot/imagetransfer.py) wants to help. If this script is able to fill in the Infomation template automatically - I doubt it a bit. If not ... we respect the non-ex. FOP in UAE. There are also other things to work on. Maybe they change law someday.

What should I do here? B. Gibson Barkley (talk)\n\nDepends on wether or not you mind. If you mind, the first thing to do is to write them a letter, explaining who you are, and requesting rectification of the problem. If the rectification is not possible, a good idea is to ask for monetary compensation against the normal fees for such works and such uses. I would try to keep the whole thing as much as an \"educational experience\" as possible for them, unless they really are in it to rip you off. Then it might be time to approach a lawyer. There might be some useful information here. TheDJ (talk)\n\nthank you, I realized when I uploaded the Image that it might be used this way but this is absurd. B. Gibson Barkley (talk)\n\nWhich is image is it about?--DieBuche (talk)\n\nI study new religious movements (commonly called cults), as a Value free social scientist I do not judge groups for their \"heretical theology.\" I took the photo of one of their ritualistic wedding dances. I receive \"google alerts\" when one the groups I study gets mentioned in the news and was tad dismayed when I saw one of my photos was in the middle of a hit piece on the group. I sent them a letter (per TheDJ's advice) to them and they have removed it. thanx again for your help. B. Gibson Barkley (talk)\n\neven the site of the \"free christian press\" is a blatant copy of the new york times site. I thought those guys believe in certain values...--DieBuche (talk)\n\nWell, good for you that they removed it - they could also have chosen to use it correctly under the CC-BY-SA license, which could have been even more irritating for you, I assume, as your name would have appeared there. This is one of the reasons I usually prefer a license that doesn't require attribution (i.e. PD resp. CC-zero), as you have no control over who is going to use your images in which context. I prefer no attribution over attribution in a context I don't want to be associated with. Gestumblindi (talk)\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported allows some limiting of what they can do. I still have control over \"moral rights\" they would also have to licenses their site under free license (which no one on earth would do for profit). So I am happy with the licensing.\n\nInteresting variation on \"flat earth\" geography, let alone the \"Armageddon - wedding\" link. Andy Dingley (talk)\n\nNo not flat earth Geography, they maybe on the \"cutting edge of creationism\" but no. the pupose is a bit clearer with these two destroying the earth to make a new Destoying sin to enter a golden age. B. Gibson Barkley (talk)\n\nThis is why I usually avoid taking pictures of people without them knowing it will be uploaded to Commons (and what that entails), as I think there are considerations of ethics over releasing an image under a free license so that anyone can use it and you (or the people in the picture) have to pursue them if they use it in a disreputable way. There is only so much the {{Personality rights}} tag can do. Sometimes, though, when I get the chance to photograph a celebrity, the temptation is too much! :-) Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nAugust 5\n\nI recently had occasion to move File:Roy Cohn.jpg from Category:LGBT politicians to Category:LGBT politicians from the United States, but I was wondering (for him and for a few others) how appropriate is the designation. Cohn never publicly acknowledged his (undoubted) homosexuality, and I would normally hesitate to apply the terms \"gay\" or \"LGBT\" to such a total closet case, especially in conjunction with \"politician\", where the conjunction suggests someone who actively engaged in politics as gay (/lesbian/bisexual). (Similar issue for lesbian or bisexual; transgender can be clearer if the person lived publicly as each gender at a different time, even if they never embraced a transgender identity.) Others' thoughts on this? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nen Wikipedia has a policy on this - en:WP:BLPCAT. There is a prior discussion [4] and proposed policy here. Benchill (talk)\n\nNot a lot of relevant conclusions there. Of course we should not attach these categories where the matter is doubtful. The question is more a matter of connotation: does \"lesbian, gay, or bisexual\" in these categories mean open embrace of such an identity, or simply being known to have performed certain sexual acts? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWhile I agree that a bit of cautious editing judgement is needed - there is still prejudice against LGBT individuals, after all - let's not be silly about this: Obviously, people like Oscar Wilde, James the VI and I of Scotland and England, and many other historical personages may and likely should be classified in that tree, even if they never embraced the label for obvious reasons. I think we may lump Roy Cohn, who died in the early 80s, in with this group.\n\nPresuming we all accept that it's alright to classify the non-recently deceased, all we need to do is make a decision on a few categories. First off, I don't think that we need worry about these:\n\nLiving or recently deceased, known to have embraced LGBT identity: Uncontroversial: They get added to the category.\n\nRecently deceased, killed because of LGBT identity: There's probably a category for that.\n\nLiving or recently deceased, speculation they were LGBT: We usually only classify with good evidence. Leave out.\n\nPerson is in a country where homosexuality illegal: Only consider classifying if it will not do harm to them; e.g. a campaign to get them freed is based on their LGBT status.\n\nThat leaves us to deal with:\n\nLiving, known to be LGBT, but not openly. May or may not have attempted to deny status as LGBT - and this may or may not change what we decide to do.\n\nPros: Are members of categories\n\nCons: Do we have the right to out them? If they denied their status, should we insist otherwise?\n\nRecently deceased, ditto\n\nPros: Are members of categories. Deceased status may mean that they can't be hurt by any prejudice.\n\nCons: So long as the evidence of their LGBT status is good, I don't see too much of a problem in most cases\n\nSubject of a gay sex scandal, e.g. w:Ted Haggard, an evangelical preacher who attacked gays, and also had sex with them.\n\nPros: Already outed; are members of categories\n\nCons: Given the circumstances of their outing, they may be very eager to deny it, and our classifying them according to the scandal MIGHT cause issues.\n\nSo, thoughts on those three situations? Objections to anything I said before that? Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nIt's so much easier when your new favourite musician just says she's a lesbian. I'd personally go for more based on the identity than the act - I see no reason why straight musicians shouldn't be categorised under LGBT musicians if they play at pride festivals and such. Just remember that in these cases describing someone as male or female can be offensive as some people don't identify as either. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nIsn't it extremely confusing to users if images of musicians are placed in \"LGBT musicians\" simply if they appear at a pride festival? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\n\"A\", no, but I feel if they're regulars, it's not unreasonable. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nIf anything, I think a straight person probably would be best placed into a \"Gay Activist\" category. As for how to categorize people in general, I think subjective categories should only be added when the subject themselves view it to be true. So Category 1 above, I say No. Category 2, Yes if there are reliable sources for it. Category 3, No unless the subject does identifies him/herself as LGBT (e.g., en:Jim McGreevey). Tabercil (talk)\n\nI would like to get some community input concerning a dispute over this image. There is agreement over adding Category:Flag burning and Category:Anti-Zionism. In addition I would like to add Category:antisemitism. My thinking is that Categories are intended to make it easier for people to find images suitable to their purpose.\n\nIt is not our business as Commons editors to pre-determine how a particular image is used. In this case the image can best be categorized as\n\nFlag burning,\n\nAnti-Zionism, and\n\nAntisemitism.\n\nIt seems likely that there will be people searching in all three categories who will find this image useful, and Commons editors have no business censoring how an image will be used. Since it is likely that some people searching Commons for images in the Category:Antisemitism images will think this image useful to their purpose, not adding the category could amount to a form of censorship.\n\nAt the moment the filed is locked to prevent further revisions to categories. Malcolm Schosha (talk)\n\nI think Malcolm failed to present the issue in a neutral manner. There is debate over if the image should be categorised as Antisemitism or not. The Anti-Zionism category was suggested as a compromise. As the image shows an objection to the state of Israel (or it's action"
