        "text": "Archive 1\n\nThis archive contains discussion from the old project, before it was resuscitated in its current form.\n\nWikipedia pages include text, graphics, and audio. Text is covered by official policies. Graphics is the pictorial information displayed by a computer screen and audio relates to the reproduction of sound. WikiProject templates may contain graphics request parameters. In addition, requests for graphics and audio may be made by one of four request templates.\n\nTemplate:Reqphotographics - for material which requires some Wikipedian effort needed to create the graphics (Wikipedian photographs)\n\nTemplate:Reqcreategraphics - for material which requires significant Wikipedian effort to create the graphic (animation, drawings, (chemical, engineering), diagrams, equations, line art, maps, paintings, video)\n\nTemplate:Reqacquiregraphics - for material which requires no effort to create the graphics since the graphics already have been created but not yet added to Wikipedia (album covers, book covers, comic pages, emblems (scout), screenshots)\n\nTemplate:Reqcreateaudio - Such as audio samples and article voice recordings.\n\nDiscussion on above request template proposal\n\nAre these intended to replace existing templates such as reqphoto and reqimage? If so how would they be replaced (in the template pages and in the articles referencing them)? I feel the distinction between types of requests by effort involved not useful to getting the request addressed, it just adds confusion to readers. I do see however some requests for graphics should be highlighted or separated so that specific project teams can see them; for example maps or diagrams are different from screenshots or photographics. On the other hand all requests for an image (no matter what type) should be listed by the subject they are related to (for example related to a country project). My main concern is the request graphics/image/photo template should be easy for occasional users to put things into a useful category without having to spend too much effort understanding the finer points of such a project as this. -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nMy thinking was that once you and I and whoever else joins this discussion come up with a solution to the every growing and somewhat ambiguous, overlaping templates listed atCategory:Image request templates, we could then work to make it happen.\n\nQ. Are these intended to replace existing templates such as reqphoto and reqimage? If so how would they be replaced (in the template pages and in the articles referencing them)? -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nMy initial thinking was that WikiProject Graphics would come to an agreement on all the parameters needed for graphics request templates. Then we would create the above four templates using all the parameters needed, such as those used in those templates at Image request templates. Then use Wikipedia:Requested moves to rename all the templates listed at Image request templates to one of four templates. The renaming could be done at Bot requests. GregManninLB (talk)\n\nQ. I feel the distinction between types of requests by effort involved not useful to getting the request addressed, it just adds confusion to readers. I do see however some requests for graphics should be highlighted or separated so that specific project teams can see them; for example maps or diagrams are different from screenshots or photographics. -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nI see your point. Template:ReqMap is so much clearer than Template:ReqCreateGraphics. We probably will keep some of the request templates listed at Image request templates. Also, we might not need some of the above four proposed templates as the same results may be achieved through categorization. GregManninLB (talk)\n\nQ. On the other hand all requests for an image (no matter what type) should be listed by the subject they are related to (for example related to a country project). -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nThat can be addressed through the template parameters and the categories those parameters populate. GregManninLB (talk)\n\nQ. My main concern is the request graphics/image/photo template should be easy for occasional users to put things into a useful category without having to spend too much effort understanding the finer points of such a project as this.' -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nThat can be addressed through the template parameters and the categories those parameters populate so that there would be no need for the occasional users to understand the finer points of such a project as this. GregManninLB (talk)\n\nTemplate:reqimage and Template:reqphoto (Moved from here)\n\nChange reqimage to be same as reqphoto syntax and functions with following differences:-\n\nPlaces requests in categories based on naming convention subject articles needing images to match that generated from most project template requests (image-needed=yes).\n\nAdditional field type with values such as photo, screenshot, cover, map. This could then also place the request in the categories based on graphic format.\n\nThis provides a simply way of making a request for occasional contributors, but is expandable for those familiar with the Wikipedia structure and projects. The main advantage is that there would only be one place for people active in a project to look at current requests. -- Traveler100 (talk)\n\nComment on this User talk:OsamaK#Size of non-fee images and this User talk:Traveler100#OKBot.\n\nThe project generates two reports with images without descriptions:\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Check Wikipedia#Image gallery without description\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Check Wikipedia#Image without description\n\n-- User:Docu\n\nIf anyone is still monitoring this page, input welcome here:\n\nTemplate talk:Reqphoto#proposal to rename template\n\nYou might want to look at this proposal. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nSwwwwwweeeeet! – Quadell (talk)\n\nIt's not done yet! :) –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI'd recommend jettisoning the /left /right thing, and putting all page design into one page (with sections transcluded as needed). It also seems to need a 4th section: \"Resources\"? – Quadell (talk)\n\nDo you mean getting rid of the that layout, or just how the two panels are transcluded? I'd support the latter, now that I've seen that it is actually possible to do that without too much additional work (I'd thought that having all of the various nested tables would cause problems, but it appears that they don't). I personally like the layout visually (if you couldn't tell : ), and would oppose refactoring the page to be a single column.\n\nRegardless, there certainly need to be more sections. \"Resources\" is definitely a good idea for one, and having a \"task forces\" section on the main page will be nice (by the way, great addition of TFP! I hadn't thought of that one). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWow. You visual people make very pretty project pages. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nWikiProject Images and Media needs a nice-looking page. :) –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nOh, I am all admiration and envy, with my text-heavy design aesthetic self. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI love the layout, but I'm starting to think there are too many colors. I'd recommend going will all purple (the main page's \"Today's featured picture\" color), like at this edit. Alternatively we could pick a pallet of 2 or 3 colors, and use just them. But too many colors spoils the design, in my opinion. – Quadell (talk)\n\n{{User WikiProject Images & Media}} could use the same colorscheme as well. – Quadell (talk)\n\nI don't really like the grayish of the TFP color... I'd rather go with the green used for the main header. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nDamn it's looking good. I think we're just about ready to actually discuss image issues, instead of just WikiProject layout and organization issues. Hurrah! – Quadell (talk)\n\nAwesome! –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nSeems that there's one other thing to work out right now... the noticeboard header looks all weird when you open one of the tasks & tips. I can try and fix this tomorrow unless somebody beats me to it. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nIt looks fine in Chrome, but IE and Firefox both stretch it out. Should we just incorporate the \"participant\" info into the intro? – Quadell (talk)\n\nSure; I'll do this shortly. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nDone. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nGreat work with the border here! I've added it to the Commons page, too. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI wonder if there should be a member list, or if the category would be enough... People always forget that they added themselves to the list, and then the awkward business of removing inactive users. I'm not totally against it, but I think if we just added the category to userboxes, or people manually added it to their page, it would be more helpful. If it weren't for the box I have on my page, I'm sure I'd forget about Stub Sorting. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nThe problem is that not everyone uses userboxes, and then they'd need to add the category manually. Having the list also lets people add comments. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nLet's look at taskforces really carefully here. Are they useful? How or why? What can be better accomplish with a taskforce, rather than general discussion here on the talkpage (or at a specific policy page)? – Quadell (talk)\n\nI know they can certainly be useful situationally. The taskforce for cleaning up the gastropod copyvio has been a huge help for Wikipedia:WikiProject Copyright Cleanup. Aside from situationally, I would only think that a taskforce would be useful if the project grows so vast that the common pool of contributors can't keep up with everything...and especially if there are enough contributors to subdivide. When the project participant list is still small, centralizing efforts makes sense. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nAs I explain below, my kind of plan with task forces here isn't as much that they'd be \"coordinated efforts\" the way that the project as a whole is, but rather subpages which provide more detailed information on what can be done. The tasks & tips section here is useful, but some of the things at pages like WP:MFIC would be useful, too. Maybe \"departments\" would be a better name? They'd really just be subpages with additional guidance and suggestions. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nIf there aren't enough people to do the work in those projects as it is, how would \"task forces\" work? --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\n\"Moving images to Commons\" is a task. But \"free images\" and \"fair use images\" aren't tasks. \"Renaming poorly-named images\" is a task, but I don't think it needs a taskforce. I'm just not sold on the idea. – Quadell (talk)\n\nMy thoughts are that \"Free images\" isn't a task in and of itself, but it can be composed of tasks such as \"verifying free status of images and ensuring that free images are properly tagged\". Ditto \"fair use images\"... \"Ensure that all fair-use images have valid fair-use rationales for all articles, that they meet the non-free content critera, and that they have proper copyright tags\". In this way, different \"tasks\" could be broken up by topic. If wanted, moving images to Commons could also be subsumed into \"free images\" because they are in the same area. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nMaybe there's an issue of definition here? To me, the value of this project is that it is picking up functions of projects that are moribund through low participation. That's what I thought was meant by \"more productive collaboration\"—a collecting of tasks into a tighter group that might accomplish the goals without being spread too thin. A \"task force\" is \"a non-independent subgroup of a larger WikiProject that covers some defined part of the WikiProject's scope.\" Do we have the manpower to form subgroups? If not, what is the value of demoting these existing moribund projects into taskforces? Quoting more from that document:\n\nThe major distinction between a task force and a fully independent WikiProject—and, indeed, the reason why the task force model was developed—is that the task force minimizes the bureaucratic overhead of its activities by relying on the parent project to provide as much of the procedural and technical infrastructure as possible. Thus, for example, a task force will use the core project's peer review and assessment processes rather than creating its own. This allows the task force to focus primarily on direct article-writing activity, without the need to devote extensive resources to maintaining its own internal structure.\n\nIs this what you mean by taskforces? If so, I'm afraid we may have a very basic problem in that these groups all already have their own procedural and technical infrastructure; they evidently don't just have enough people doing them. I think if you weren't planning to merge these groups into one group of active contributors but rather to reorganize them under a central governance, where each group persisted with its own members, then I may have misunderstood your proposal. :/ --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI'm sorry that I was unclear. I meant that we should have a single group and a single members list, with the \"task forces\" actually being \"departments\" (I know this contradicts something that I said below; I was being stupid then :) ). These \"departments\" would not have their own members list or goals, but rather provide further guidance and information on how to achieve specific parts of the project's overarching goal: maintain images and media. If you look at the Dungeons & Dragons WikiProject, you'll see a similar set up... it has a number of departments which can be used to help coordinate and improve the usefulness of the main project page. (WP:DND/R and WP:DND/M are examples). One example for this project is that the list of categories containing images eligable for copying to Commons wouldn't fit on this page, but it could fit nicely onto a separate page containing both that list and the content at WP:MITTC. If you'd rather not do this, I won't object further, but I think that having this kind of thing would be helpful. If you'd like, I could come up with a mock-up of a department. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nOh, I've got you, I think. Are you suggesting that we incorporate the existing project pages (or at least, perhaps the task-specific portions of them?) as subpages to this group setting out procedures, but not subdividing the labor? We'd all still be the same pool of contributors at this project; it's just a method of organizing materials? If I'm understanding you, then I think that would probably work. I'm a bit nervous about the language being used, though, since both \"task force\" and \"department\" do suggest separate staffing. :) I think Wikipedia:WikiProject Dungeons & Dragons/References is probably a good example of how it could work. Wikipedia:WikiProject Dungeons & Dragons/Mergers might be a bit difficult, since it is basically a separate talk page. If my own experiences at launching Wikipedia:WikiProject Copyright Cleanup are any indication, it's challenging enough getting responders to the main page. We might not want to subpage active discussions until we know we have enough active people to cover all our bases. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI was planning on having things more like the references subpage rather than the mergers subpage; I was just giving out some examples. And you're exactly right; it's a way of organizing materials. I think that \"task force\" is right out as an option with that scope in mind. My feeling is that \"department\" works, but I see your point too. Would \"guideline\" be okay? That's really what they would be, but just not in the \"official Wikipedia guideline\" sense. They'd have more information on tasks that can be done and guidelines on how to do them. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nGuideline is a nice basic word; it works for me. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI dunno. \"Guideline\" has a specific meaning here. What we would produce would be How-tos, or essays, or helpfiles. But even so, I think we should wait to split things up like this. If there's a need for a specific document (e.g. \"How to move a file to Commons\", then we'll hash it out on talk and figure out where to put it later. I really see the value in keeping things simple, until it is evident that the added complexity would be helpful. – Quadell (talk)\n\nOkay; one step at a time sounds like a good plan. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\n←This has gone way too far over. :) I've made a new \"Redirect proposal\", since I've linked it at all the project pages. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nJust to say I think it is a good idea to get a list of all image resources listed together. When I have an issue with copyright or placing images in articles it is very difficult to find the relevant information and help pages. Making information that is already available more viable and locatable to people would be beneficial to all contributors to Wikipedia.Traveler100 (talk)\n\nGetting all the different project tasks into one location (although maybe different pages) is a good idea. Could you maybe create an example of how you see sub-tasks being organized and displayed? Also although I like the visual look and layout of this project, please do not get to clever with templates, hidden options and tables as it will get too difficult for people not experts in mediawiki to edit and contribute to the project.Traveler100 (talk)\n\nI think that the layout is about as complicated as its going to get, and uses transclusion for a lot of the things on the main page so that you don't need to worry about table code to edit the content. Anyway, there are a few such \"subpage-taskforce-department\"y things accessible from the tabs at the top of the page. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWill we eventually turn Wikipedia:WikiProject Free images, Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use, Wikipedia:WikiProject Moving free images to Wikimedia Commons, and Wikipedia:WikiProject Illustration into redirects here? At what point would that be appropriate? – Quadell (talk)\n\nWell, it's been six days since it was proposed. For the sake of pretty numbers, I'd give it one more. After it's been posted a week, I'd put another notice saying that barring disagreement the project page will be redirected; perhaps a link could be provided to a merge discussion here? I'd be happy to whip up a courtesy notice to drop on the talk pages of categorized members of those projects to alert them to the discussion. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nHm, looks like this task requires tact and patience. Well then... Acting on behalf of no authority whatsoever, I designate you, Moonriddengirl, as Temporary I&M Project Merge Ambassador. – Quadell (talk)\n\nAll right. I will accept that responsibility. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nAs you can see, immediately below, I have an intro to the concept. :) I plan to drop a note at the page of each participant pointing them to it. Language seem all clear? Any confusions or problems? (By the way, I decided a few hours less than seven might be fine, since I noticed there's no wikilink to this page. I haven't checked, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did not yet exist. :)) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI will certainly wait until there's agreement for how to handle this before sending out any notices. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nProposal #1\n\nA proposal to merge the projects Wikipedia:WikiProject Free images, Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use, Wikipedia:WikiProject Moving free images to Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia:WikiProject Illustration into this one has met with general support at Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Files. As each of these projects seems to be inactive, the goal is to unite their purposes into an active, inclusive project that will keep moving forward with the aims of addressing various issues related to images and media on Wikipedia. If there are no objections, we propose to redirect each of these projects to this page after several days. Of course, we heartily welcome participants of any of these projects to join in here and help out. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nMy plan was to make them into task forces/departments. Each of those subpages would then contain additional information on specific tasks related to their scope than the main project page can contain. I hope to do that over the next few days if there isn't objection... I was actually going to move those two subpages here and redesign them, but keep their \"membership\" lists and overall scope. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWhich two subpages? – Quadell (talk)\n\nMy apologies... moving those projects here and making them subpages. This is really being discussed more above, however. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI'm going to start alerting people to the note below. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nGreat job, Ambassador Moon! – Quadell (talk)\n\nLost internet connectivity partway through! Stupid technology. Back and a few OTRS letters later, I'm back at it. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nAll right; I am done. I have to the best of my ability notified almost every member of these four projects who has edited since the start of 2009 unless they have retired, \"vanished\" or been indefinitely blocked. The few exceptions are individuals who have edited once or twice since 2009 and give other indication that they aren't likely to show up (such as the individual who hasn't edited more than five times a year in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and only edited once so far in 2009). --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nA proposal to merge the projects Wikipedia:WikiProject Free images, Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use, Wikipedia:WikiProject Moving free images to Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia:WikiProject Illustration into this one has met with general support at Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Files. As each of these projects seems to be inactive, the goal is to unite their purposes into an active, inclusive project that will keep moving forward with the aims of addressing various issues related to images and media on Wikipedia. If there are no objections, we propose to merge necessary content of and then redirect each of these projects to this page after several days. Of course, we heartily welcome participants of any of these projects to join in here and help out. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nI think Wikipedia:WikiProject Image Monitoring Group could probably also be merged - the aims seem to be very similar. PhilKnight (talk)\n\nGood idea. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nThe merge of thses seems reasonable to me. VegaDark (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, I am no longer able to find motivation to do any work in Wikipedia (other than update a few things here and there). Therefore, I agree that any move done in order to keep the free spirit going is a good one (even if I would like not to have a WikiProject Fair Use around). -- ReyBrujo (talk)\n\nI feel your pain, ReyBrujo. Been there. But, to the point, I agree that this merge proposal is a good one. لennavecia\n\nTotally agree to the proposal. Count me in....--MisterWiki talking! :-D -\n\nSince commons has different copyight standards for PD-US works compared to en there is the risk of issues with regards to bringing in WikiProject Moving free images to Wikimedia Commons.Geni\n\nHaving the project there and having its goals listed on this page doesn't really make much of a difference in what is done... WP:MITTC has information on this, so I'm not sure that it would be a problem. (my personal opinion on this is that Wikipedia's free content policies should reflect Commons', but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nCorrection: MITTC does not specifically say that, although I think that the pages that it links to do. WP:MFIC doesn't say it either right now, as far as I can see, so redirecting that here won't get rid of that information or anything, since it already isn't there. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nIt'd be good to have that info somewhere easy to find. The main categories of images that shouldn't be moved to Commons are:\n\nNon-free images (obviously)\n\nWorks considered \"free\" in the U.S., but \"non-free\" in their country of origin (e.g. free photos of French buildings, or pre-1923 photos where the author died less than 70 years ago)\n\nWorks of exclusive interest to en.Wiki, where the creator has requested we keep the image here.\n\nSo far as I can tell, that's all that should stay here. And only category #2 really needs much explanation. – Quadell (talk)\n\nWhile I am glad to see that someone was actually able to get this page some traffic, I am confused by this proposal. Is it just to redirect several other projects to this one? Is that what \"merge\" means? I see that as a good idea only with WP:IMG, as it is almost the same focus as this project. The other ones should probably be moved to active/inactive subpages, and then the projects redirected to this. We should also include Wikipedia:WikiProject Animated Wikipedia, Wikipedia:WikiProject Free book covers, Wikipedia:Photo Matching Service, Wikipedia:WikiProject Free music, Wikipedia:WikiProject Sound, Wikipedia:WikiProject Panorama Welding, and Wikipedia:WikiProject SVG.\n\nOnce this project is more active Wikipedia:Graphic Lab and Wikipedia:WikiProject Media Restoration should probably be moved to subpages as well. We should probably not take in Wikipedia:WikiProject Photography, Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia, Wikipedia:Requested pictures or Wikipedia:WikiProject Maps. I mean if we're going to centralize, let's centralize. That doesn't mean, however, that we should simply delete and redirect. I just did a lot of work on the categories at Wikipedia:WikiProject Moving free images to Wikimedia Commons (they now automatically display how many files are left), and would be very put off if that were deleted. I managed to get several of those categories empty (although Quadell is finishing off Category:Presumed GFDL images), and am working on the rest, which is the benefit of that page in the first place. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nYou noticed! Only 3 left! – Quadell (talk)\n\nThis was why I proposed having \"departments\" originally; there was a small amount of opposition. I still fully support having subpages here for each of those projects (nice work locating those others, BTW) that would contain the guidelines and things like the list of move-to-Commons categories, but not the members list (since there would be a single \"Images and Media\" participants list). I can start getting that kind of thing set up if you'd like... I feel that it can only help the project (see #Taskforces for previous discussion on this point). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nTotally agree about the members (as long as those users are okay with it). I don't know that \"task forces\" are needed, but resource pages are needed. Even if all of these old project pages aren't super-useful, mark them as historical or inactive. Someone can do something with them someday, and history is a good thing in a project. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nSounds good. I can start working on this probably tomorrow. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nSo, as an example, I've moved the highly-inactive Wikipedia:WikiProject Sound to Wikipedia:WikiProject Images and Media/Sound and marked it as historical; I've moved Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sound to Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Images and Media/Archive WikiProject Sound; I've redirected Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Images and Media/Sound to this main talk page; I've moved the /Old to a standard archive, and added an archive box (search should work once the moved pages enter the index, I think). Does this make sense? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nAbsolutely. It could use a little additional cleanup to have the project's formatting, but I can probably work on that a bit later today. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nBased on input at Wikipedia talk:Image copyright tags/Public domain/Mistagged images, I have created a new tag: {{PD-US-suspect}}. You can place it on images tagged {{PD-US}}, but where there's no evidence that the image was published before 1923. (Many people confuse creation date with publication date.) This tag places images in Category:Images needing PD-US verification, which contains some good copyright info for works created before 1923. If you want to help, you can go to that category and see if you can find evidence that the images are actually PD. (Note that this is not a deletion category -- this is a clean-up category. If you think an image is probably not in the public domain, you can list it at Wikipedia:Possibly unfree files.) – Quadell (talk)\n\nSounds good. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI note that Wikipedia:WikiProject Photography was not mentioned on the merge list. Perhaps this should also be merged here. Also, there probably shouldn't be a capital 'M' in media. Richard001 (talk)\n\nAgreed on the merge, but isn't \"WikiProject Images and Media\" a proper name? I know that a lot of WikiProjects only have the first word capitalized, but that seems kind of weird to me because it is a name. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nNote that JohnnyMrNinja (talk · contribs) said just yesterday that it might not make sense to merge Wikipedia:WikiProject Photography with this one. I'm a member of WP Photography and it sounds to me like the merge would make sense, but it might need some more discussion.\n\nThis project looks very promising. I have been trying lately to coordinate more work around cleaning up abandoned or stale image requests, but it seems like most of the work has been done lately by Traveler100 (talk · contribs) and myself. I would love to get some new energy for those tasks. Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nI take it back! I didn't realize that it was currently inactive, and for some reason I was thinking that their focus was article space. Having actually looked at it now, I'd say it'd be ideal for a merge.\n\nAs far as the capital M, why not? Isn't the title of a Wikiproject a proper noun? I know that other projects do whatever, but WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS, and just because they're doing it doesn't mean it's correct. I'm honestly asking, because this really does look to me like the correct formatting of a title. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nExactly! (that having been said, I've created a redirect from the alternate capitalization, just in case). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI think it would be a good idea to merge all these projects. Hopefully a larger group of people can get more tasks addressed effectively. What does need to done is better co-ordination of tasks from these many projects, as sometimes they work against each other. For example WikiProject Photography aim is to address request for images but other projects tend to discourage people from contributing: over enthusiastic users tag photographs as non-free because somewhere in the photo is a company logo. This in its self is, although annoying, not a big issue. However the image is then picked up by OKbot (or maybe in future NeuRobot 2) and is reduced in size, even thought the copyrighted part of the image was already small.Traveler100 (talk)\n\nI do a lot of work closing deletion debates at Wikipedia:Files for deletion and Wikipedia:Possibly unfree files. But there are a few discussion I don't feel comfortable closing, either because I am conflicted about the outcome, or because I have commented enough that my closing might appear biased. Could an admin here who is well-versed in policy take a look at the following old deletion discussions and close them? (If you need help knowing the technical method for closure, just ask.) (Please don't feel biased toward closing these in the way I advocated in the individual comments, just because I asked here. I'd rather someone close them \"the wrong way\" than leave them open indefinitely.) – Quadell (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Possibly unfree files/2009 March 21 - 2 images remaining.

Ish. – Quadell (talk)\n\nOkay then; I'll see what I can do. Hey, if I make a mistake it's easy enough to revert. :) (not to say that I don't care about making mistakes, but you get the point :) ). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWP:PUF is now completely caught up. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nIs there a bot that removes already-deleted images from articles? I'm sure I've seen some around, but I just can't think of they're names. I'm just asking because it would be a lot easier to work through some of the deletion categories if you didn't also need to worry about removing the images from articles. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nYes, but I don't remember which one does this. User:OrphanBot does something like it. Anyway, you never have to remove images from articles anymore once you delete them. (If you're curios, just delete an image an put an article it was in on your watchlist. I did that, but I can't remember which bot it was.) – Quadell (talk)\n\nThese days, it's User:ImageRemovalBot. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nI was going to make something like this already, but this question forced me to do it. Wouldn't it be great to have all of the bots that perform file tasks on one list? Presenting (the barely-formed) Wikipedia:WikiProject Images and Media/Bots. I know that a table would be great, but I'm not good at those. Please add to it, and hopefully it can be complete sometime soon. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nAwesome! Thanks. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI've left some questions at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Images and Media/Bots. – Quadell (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Template:GFDL-presumed. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nThanks; added to the noticeboard. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\n(Cross post from Category talk:Copy to Wikimedia Commons) Awhile (April 14th) ago I requested a \"comparison\" of the files in this category and here are the results\n\nA. Files that are lacking a {{Information}} template. (Results)\n\nB. Files that are tagged with both {{Copy to Wikimedia Commons}} and {{Should be SVG}}. (Results)\n\nThe reasons I requested these is that files with a Information template are \"easier\" to transfer over because they useally have a descriptive file name if they need it and so that others knows what it is displaying, and the second report is because {{Convert to SVG and copy to Wikimedia Commons}} which is a combination of both those templates puts the file into a seperate category so that people can work on those seperately. So perhaps we could:\n\nA. Work on getting the files tagged with the Information template so they are easier for people to transfer over to commons (and rename if needed).\n\nB. Put in a BOTREQ for the second report so that a bot move all the files with both the templates to the combined template ({{Convert to SVG and copy to Wikimedia Commons}}) so they are put in the seperate category since they need work completed first before they are transfered.\n\nWhat do you people think? Peachey88 (Talk Page · Contribs)\n\nI'm not quite sure that I see the benefit of the Information list, but the other is definetely a great idea! A bot to fix those would be really nice. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nYou can't excatly use a bot to file fill in {{information}} because many differnt things could be the file description, the date that can be used (i perfer using a date from the image data over the upload date) ect. Peachey88 (Talk Page · Contribs)\n\nThe proposal wasn't to have a bot add an {{information}} template, just to mark which files don't have one. That would make it easier for editors to identify which files need them, and add them by hand as necessary. That seems like a fine idea. Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nIn my experience, it's no more difficult to transfer images without an Information tag. If they have a description and valid tag (like this one), then the FileScripts tool will create an Information tag on the Commons version (like this). So adding an Information tag on the local version would just be unnecessary work. (But B is a great idea, and you should definitely request it.) – Quadell (talk)\n\nTim, i never said anything about a bot to do them, that was Drilnorth, I was just pointing out why it in theory wouldn't be the best concept. Quadell, The reason information makes it \"easier\" to transfer files is that so people can more easily categorize/rename them, eg if someone was to move File:100_2157.jpg over, they might just categorize it as a blue car where as if it had a filled in information tag, someone could categorize it into the make of car, model of the car and ect. Peachey88 (Talk Page · Contribs)\n\nMy apologies if I was unclear; I meant that a bot could do task B. Task A would probably be impossible. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI'm not sure \"free\" should be a tab. – Quadell (talk)\n\nWhat you you call it and the subpage? I couldn't think of a better name (or are you saying that there just shouldn't be a tab to the subpage?) –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI don't think we need a separate page (or tab) on free media. There's really no information on that page that isn't better covered elsewhere. I don't think we need a separate page or tab on non-free media either. – Quadell (talk)\n\nBTW, this happened. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nI'm not sure exactly what Quadell means, but I do think that there are going to be too many pages to all have tabs. I think a sidebar might be appropriate. Also, I think for now we should hold off on moving all of the subpages of the projects (like these), until we are done with the main pages and have a complete list. Some we can re-purpose, some we'll need to delete/merge/archive or whatever. I'm just leaving them there for now. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nOkay. Anyway, at least at WP:DND we use two rows of tabs to improve layout, although a sidebar might make more sense. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI'm thinking about having User:MiszaBot II auto-archive this page, archiving threads not discussed in 7 days. Any objections? – Quadell (talk)\n\nSounds good. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nAutomatic archiving already? *tears up* They grow up so fast, you know? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nFor copyright concerns, it's not always easy to get good info on whether images are in the public domain. The best offline resource I've found is Stephen Fishman's \"The Public Domain: How to Find and Use Copyright-Free Writings, Music, Art, and More\". Available at finer libraries everywhere. Well worth looking into. – Quadell (talk)\n\nWhat is the policy concerning use of fair use images for games with multiple ports? If a game is made for the Gamecube, PS2, and Gameboy Advance is it acceptable for articles to have screenshots from all versions or is one version acceptable? WP:NFCC doesn't really mention this scenario so I am asking here to see if somebody knows what I should do. Thanks, much in advance. NanohaA'sYuriTalk, My master\n\nI'd say that if the game versions are significantly different, it could be valid depending on the rationale (for example, the difference between console and handheld or Wii and PS3). Multiple images from the same console can also work, but they'd also need strong rationales. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nThere's no hard-and-fast rule, but the best way to answer this is by example. The original Donkey Kong game of 1981 was ported to many home computer systems, and back then the differences in graphics and processor capabilities was enormous. Note the different looks of these ports: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Barely recognizable as the same game. And yet Donkey Kong (video game), a featured article, shows two screenshots of the main arcade version (fully described and relevant to commentary on characters), and a screenshot of a single port (the very different \"Game & Watch\" version), as well as a pseudo-screenshot of instruction on a cocktail port. I think we can safely consider this an upper limit on acceptable use of screenshots. So yes, if merited by differences in play and extended text description, you can show a screenshot of a second port. But don't overdo it. – Quadell (talk)\n\nFYI, The bot User:CommonsDelinker, which removes references to deleted Commons images from Wikipedia articles, is the subject of a lively discussion at this Administrator Noticeboard thread. – Quadell (talk)\n\nThere's a fairly large discussion going on at Wikipedia talk:Non-free content/Archive 41#Proposal: revise wording of NFCC 10a (requirement for copyright holder details). It's currently listed on Template:Cent. Radiant chains (talk)\n\nI just posted a discussion at the WikiProject for Infoboxes regarding standardizing logo dimensions in infoboxes. Would you please consider chiming in over there? user:j (aka justen)\n\nThere's an open bot request at Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/SoxBot 17 that would get all the transclusions of {{Copy to Wikimedia Commons}}. For each one, it will see if {{Should be SVG}} is on it. If it is, then it removes both and adds {{Convert to SVG and copy to Wikimedia Commons}}. The idea behind this bot is the opinion that it would be better to convert the images to SVG first, and move them to Commons afterward, rather than sending our images to Commons when they still need work. But some aren't sure that's a good idea. If you could comment there, it would be helpful. – Quadell (talk)\n\nNow that Category:Articles which may no longer need images is coming up on 10,000 articles, it may be time for me to start throwing out the ideas that I've had for improving Wikipedia's image coverage:\n\nStep 1: Remove unneeded image requests. A lot of those 10,000 articles may still need images, but quite a lot of them do not. If we can get that number down close to zero, we may be reasonably confident that every article under Category:Wikipedia requested photographs really does need an image of some kind. If we can find 100 editors each to update 100 of those articles, we can knock it out in no time at all.\n\nOnce that work is done, we can proceed to:\n\nStep 2: The Wikipedia 2009 Photo Drive. Even after clearing out stale image requests, there will be, by my estimates, some 50,000 articles in need of images. I propose that we organize and promote a friendly competition among editors to fulfill as many of these requests as possible by some date -- say, September 1, 2009. I think that making it part of an organized push to improve Wikipedia image coverage would help get people excited about taking part and would encourage them to join in. I would love to see how many outstanding image requests we could knock off that queue in three or four months.\n\nComments and suggestions welcome. I have a few more ideas about how to do this but would like to hear initial responses first. Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nThis seems like a good idea. I'd by happy to help in step 1, but probably wouldn't be able to do much for step 2. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWhat about a Commons drive in addition or instead? Basically, have a friendly competition to see who can move the most images to the Commons correctly. I think that having free files stored locally is a pretty big problem. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nSure! I confess this has not been a big issue on my radar but it seems like a fine thing to organize a party for. :-) Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nMost articles in Category:Articles which may no longer need images no longer need images; but currently it's a bit difficult to check. When one looks at the category, one has to click on a talk page in the category, then click to see the actual article, visually inspect it, click back to the talk page, edit, then either find and remove the template (which could be in several forms) if it has a good image, or remove the category (which could be anywhere on the page) and change the template if the article still needs an image, and save. It seems like one should be able to make this easier with a script, where when you're on the article page you can click a button and have it find and remove the bits from the talkpage. Is this something that someone here could whip up? – Quadell (talk)\n\nI could probably come up with a script to do this without too much difficulty in these next few days. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nthat could be useful, it is a slow job going though these article. Traveler100 (talk)\n\nI think a JavaScript tool to help with this would be very useful, thanks! Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nI have spent some time placing requests in sub-categories with the intention of making the requests visible to people in the right WikiProjects. I have also just started to add {{Howtoreqphoto}} to the categories, hopefully to help people to sort through the lists. So one task is to do this for all photo request sub-categories and then try and get the Wikiproject members for specific subjects to help.Traveler100 (talk)\n\nSome projects use special template logic to determine if a page needs an image. For instance, chemical compounds use the {{Chembox}} infobox, which has an \"ImageFile\" parameter. If that parameter is empty, the page is automatically included in Category:Chemical pages needing a structure drawing; otherwise it's not. If someone adds an image, it is automatically removed from the list. This seems to me to be an excellent way of doing things. Of course, not all articles can do things this way; Category:Wikipedia requested photographs of environmental topics, for instance, doesn't have a standard infobox that can be counted on to be used in all circumstances. But it seems to me that people do. Every biographical article should use an infobox, either {{Infobox Person}} one of the myriad descendant infoboxes for everything from Belgian economists to left-handed lepidopterists. And it seems to me that if there's an image in that infobox then the article doesn't need a new image, and conversely, if there's no image in the infobox then we can assume the article needs a primary image of the person. I think it would be a great thing for Wikipedia to convert all {{Infobox Person}} and descendant infoboxes to put the article in a \"needs image\" category, and then we can remove all \"reqphoto\" (and similar) templates on biographical articles. The thing is, this would be a lot of work. (Like I said, there are umpteen bajillion different person infoboxes.) Thoughts? – Quadell (talk)\n\nIn general, I prefer {{reqphoto}} very strongly to the \"needs-photo\" and \"needs-image\" parameters in infoboxes. {{reqphoto}} is much more flexible -- it can be added to multiple subject and location categories, and can be used when an editor is looking for a very specific image on a page. Infobox parameters generally are just \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nAt the moment, when PhotoCatBot finds an article that carries an image request and has an infobox with an image, it will add it to Category:Articles which may no longer need images, following the reasoning you describe here. It seems like a good heuristic (but people do enough funny things with infoboxes that it would not be safe to take any more drastic measure). Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nI have created a proposal at Wikipedia talk:Upload#Free images and Commons that the members of this project may be interested in commenting on. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nDoes anyone here ever participate in Wikipedia:Picture peer review? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nWait... there is such a thing? :) Okay that's an exaggeration... I've heard of it before, but never really taken a look. I haven't really gotten involved in any of the \"quality\" picture reviewing processes yet. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI didn't know myself! I've watchlisted the page, and I want to get an idea for their pace and how things are done. It seems to be just one (dedicated) reviewer right now. At some point, well... I've always felt that any good WikiProject needs a Peer Review department. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nAnybody know where all the Commons dupes went? This tool now shows just 2500 dupes (down from 23,000 a few days ago), and most of those are local duplicates. Did some bot make quick work of them? – Quadell (talk)\n\nThat's weird... I don't know of any bot, but I'll check around a little. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI can't find anywhere near that many in the deletion log. Luk and Athaenara both deleted a fair number and there were others here and there, but nothing really stands out. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\n...and now it's back up to 25,000. Must have been a blip. – Quadell (talk)\n\nHuh... weird. Well, it's fixed now. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nUser:Wispanow has recently replaced all occurences of SensorSizes.svg with his recently-created Digital camera sensor sizes comparison.gif. There are numerous problems with the latter image:\n\nIt's a raster image, which is very undesirable for a diagram that could be better-illustrated using vector graphics. Wikipedia strongly encourages the use of scalable vector graphics wherever possible.\n\nSince it's a raster image, it's impossible for others to edit or update it without recreating it (for example to adjust the font size and placement, or change the colors, or add a new sensor size).\n\nThe text is very crowded and poorly placed with respect to the labeled rectangles.\n\nThe text uses the comma (,) instead of the period (.) as the decimal separator. This is not standard usage in any English-speaking country, and is likely to confuse anyone who views this image.\n\nThe image uses color excessively and unnecessarily, not only hurting the legibility of the image, but also making it next-to-impossible to print a legible hard-copy of this image.\n\nI have tried to convince Wispanow that this image should not be used in its present form, that he/she should not have replaced the previous image wholesale, and that at a minimum he/she needs to recreate it in SVG format for it to be useful on wikipedia. But to no avail. So I'm asking for a third opinion from some of the other image gurus on Wikipedia. Can anyone help me convince Wispanow of the problems with the image and the need to return to the previous version. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nThe image has a lot of advantages. The discussion about it goes on. Simply answer. The idea was a drawing which:\n\nShows all currently used sensor sizes exept medium format (very similar sizes not shown)\n\nShow all sizes in one stack, identified by color, to make it clear.\n\nShow exact calculated figures\n\nThat are the points. Comma can be changed. Originally a german version, forgot it.\n\nIn some points you are right. I will change colors to increase readability. Change Comma. Change size. SVG could not generated because of limitations of the format and by the program used. For printing old svg could be used. Okay?Wispanow (talk)\n\nBased upon what you both said here and a bit of talk page discussion, I'm inclined to agree that the original is better. First, it is nigh-impossible to read the new version at thumbnail size, and even at full view it isn't easy. I don't think that any changes to color will fix that; words going over the various lines like that is difficult to read no matter what the colors are. Secondly, it seems a bit blinding... some color change could fix that, but to do enough color change would negate the benefits of having different colors. When scrolling down an article, this new image kind of jumps out at you like \"Hey! Look at me!\" while the original doesn't as much, which is IMO a good thing. Finally, the ability to edit the image is important... if the new version can't easily be edited by another user, it is probably a bad replacement for one that can. What if you leave the wiki? Then the only way to update it would be to start over, since you wouldn't be able to update it. The original also seems to be more useful because the text on it is easier to understand; I, with little knowledge of sensor sizes, can much more easily figure out what the original is trying to do and understand the relations between the sizes, but this is much less clear on the new version. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nThanks, Drilnoth. Those are basically the issues I had as well. If Wispanow's new version were easily-editable (= SVG format), I'd simplify and rearrange the text and reduce the glaring colors. But, as you've, if the original is easier for someone to understand without any prior experience in this area, then it ought to be used in articles for now. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nI agree that the former image is more useful in most cases. In the future, it might be better to go to Wikipedia:Third opinion for this sort of thing, though. – Quadell (talk)\n\nI wasn't aware of that page. I've listed it there now. Thanks, Quadell. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nIt is easier to change colors in a gif than in a poor svg. SVG released. You are free to change fonts and colors. Please upload changes under the same name as a new version or:Digital camera sensor sizes comparison.svg. Wispanow (talk)\n\nThat being the case, what would you suggest changing the colors to so that the text is readable? (although that still wouldn't solve the confusion problem that I mentioned). –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWispanow, please stop saying that SVG is \"limited\" or \"poor quality\" or that it's hard to do things with SVG. It just shows your ignorance of the format. From what I gather, you made your SVG version using the SVG output feature of Photoshop. That usually works pretty well, but isn't the most powerful way to create SVG images since Photoshop is mainly a photo editor, so that is probably part of the reason you find SVG difficult to work with. As I suggested before, try Inkscape for a very powerful vector graphics editor.\n\nAnd I would concur with others that the flaws of your image make it pretty hard to get it to be as readable and useful as the other one. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nI seems unlikely to me that this \"stacked\" approach with all the colors can be made as clear and informative as the original; even making the text legible will be a challenge. Let's put the original back until we have a consensus that we have a good replacement (not all articles that use it need to use the same one, of course). Dicklyon (talk)\n\nThe first image clearly show the diferrences, the second image is just a blur of colours and texts and does not convey anything to the reader. I am pretty sure any amount of fiddling with the second image it still will not convey the same clear message as the first. MilborneOne (talk)\n\nThe first image does not show the differences, for example between Nikon and Canon APS-C. Wispanow (talk)\n\nThey look differently-sized to me, and the measurements are more readable to confirm this. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nHere's my attempt to do it right\n\nHere I've made an SVG diagram along the lines of what Wispanow is doing, but visually consistent with the previous diagram and with a goal of legibility. This is just a first draft. You'll notice that I don't include many of the smaller sensor formats. I simply don't think there is room for them, nor are they particularly relevant to the articles in which the image is used, which I believe is an important criterion for a useful image. I did include the 1/2.5\" sensor size, since it is the most common size of image sensor for compact cameras today.\n\nThoughts? I could add sensor dimensions and crop factor to this version, but want to prevent the text from become overwhelming. I'm planning to take a break from Wikipedia for a few days, but let me know what you think. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nThis is definitely better. Some text placement and adjustment would be good, but this looks like a good way to present some of the visuals of the original without the difficult reading of the previous proposal. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI enlarged the text and added 1.6\", 1.7\", 1.8\" compact camera sensor sizes. I have not added the 1/6\" size, since I can't find any reliable source that gives standard dimensions for it. But I agree with Wispanow that it is a very common size for camcorders and cell phones and ought to be included if I could get dimensions for it. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\n@Moxfyre: Your new image:\n\nis even not printable. Use different greys or better colors\n\nWhat??? The shade of gray matches that found in SensorSizes.svg, and is pretty visually consistent with Wikipedia's monobook style. What do you mean by \"better colors\"? It's much better for printing than the GIF which uses very bright colors right up against each other. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nas difficult to read as mine. Use larger fonts —Preceding unsigned comment added by Wispanow (talk • contribs)\n\nFair point, but as I said this is kind of a rough draft. It's in SVG format, so adjusting the font size is trivial. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nincludes nearly only DSRL and medium-format, only one compact format, which are the most sold.\n\nLeave away the very few used medium-format, which is not a standard-one, even on film: there is 60x45, 60x60 and 60x90mm. And a lot of digital formats. Too many \"medium-formats\" to show and too many to list here\n\nInclude most used compact formats and even 1/6\" camcorder and cell-phone format, which are common.\n\nTwo things:\n\nDid you read what I wrote above? About how one of the main criteria for a good image is whether it is useful and relevant to the articles in which it is used? Most of the articles using these images are about DSLRs, or comparison between DSLRs and compact cameras.\n\nThere's not much room to list all these compact sensor sizes and give them clearly readable labels. This is one of the reasons why comparing sensor sizes in this visual format is problematic, and why many of us like SensorSizes.svg. Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nAfter you done this, the image will look nearly as mine.Wispanow (talk)\n\nI also agree with Moxfyre and HelloAnnyong: the original SVG is easier to read, conveys more information, and matches the Wikipedia monobook theme. I like the idea of overlaying the sensor sizes, but it is hard to fit that many data points in a single rectangle. -- Autopilot (talk)\n\nI modified Moxfyre's image slightly to move the text to inside of the frame and faded out the lines where the text crossed to make it easier to read in the reduced size. As a comment on vector versus bitmap, since the original work was in SVG, it was trivial for me to re-arrange the elements to make this version in Inkscape, compared to trying to edit a raster image. Any thoughts on this layout? -- Autopilot (talk)\n\nLooks good to me. --Carnildo (talk)\n\nYeah, I second that. Good idea. I tweaked the text and arrow placement slightly (cause MediaWiki renders it *slightly* differently from Inkscape) Moxfyre (ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | contrib)\n\nI'd be grateful if you experts could run the rule over this for me.\n\nThe images appear to have been nicked from a website and posted with a creator's release by a SPA. I suspect promotional reasons.\n\nThanks --Dweller (talk)\n\nAll images listed at Wikipedia:Files for deletion/2009 May 28. Rettetast (talk)\n\nThanks. That was a very fast response! --Dweller (talk)\n\nCheck it out here. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nIs Movefile still active? I can't find any WP page that talks about it, and I'm not an admin so I can't tell. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nWhat are you referring to? – Quadell (talk)\n\nThe admin ability to rename files, its called \"movefile\" in the software (I think?). BTW, Quadell, I added a shortcut to the top of this page but couldn't make it not-weird-looking, mind taking a look? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nI don't see a move or rename tab for images. Does the shortcut look silly there where I put it? – Quadell (talk)\n\nIt breaks up the green for me in Firefox beta-whatever. I'm fine no matter where it goes, as long as people can see it. I brought my question to VPT. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nFixed the shortcut problem with some table syntax. I also went ahead and added some images; more are needed. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nThis needs a few more sets of eyes so that a consensus can be reached. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI've proposed a proposal. Please read and respond here. Thank you. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nHi. There's a question at Talk:Johnny Eck regarding the usage of non-free images of deceased individuals and how many are necessary to stand as the \"Primary means of identifying a notable person.\" Additional feedback would be most welcome. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nWould there be any interest in an organized effort throughout July to track down and get rid of all the copyvios and other problematic files that have slipped through over the years? –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nWell, sure. Such a project would undoubtedly help Wikipedia, but is likely to create some backlash, so it's best to plan on being overly communicative when need be. How do you propose to proceed? – Quadell (talk)\n\nOver the last month I have been doing a sweep of the non-free stamp images. While there has been some backlash with heated arguments in favour to try a justify their use, most have been deleted without too much drama. I am continuing the sweep which has so far deleted 80+ stamps, mainly US stamps being used in biographies. Keep an eye out on the daily deletion pages. ww2censor (talk)\n\nI've noticed; good work. I'll try to get a page set up to organize a large-scale project in the next day or two. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nPage started; I'll be putting a good bit more work into it today and tomorrow so that it is ready for July. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nI'm glad to see that \"The goal of this project is not to delete as many images as possible. The goal is to find honestly problematic images\". But bearing that in mind, there is a danger if too many fixable images are listed all at once, that may swamp the resources available to fix them. If large categories of images that need attention are discovered, that might then require discussion as to how as many of them as possible can fixed, and how that can be scheduled, rather than people just seeing it as their duty to put as much as possible on the fire.\n\nAlso, IMO it is important that this is not seen as a revivalist crusade to open up past discussions that have gone quiet. The aim of deletion should be restricted to images which really are \"copyvios\", not those that are legally permissible fair use per U.S. law. Some care is needed to be clear on this. Jheald (talk)\n\nI agree completely; the page is still being worked on, but the emphasis should be that if something can be fixed it should be fixed before deletion is considered. I chose the name \"Great Copyvio Purge\" because it was kind of catchy, IMO... it will include all \"problematic images\", like fair-use images lacking rationales or with insufficient rationales, but there again, the focus should be on fixing up and adding rationales where possible, and opening discussion on some of them. Anyway, give me another day or two to work out the page's setup and the project's organization... I think that working on fixing or removing fair-use images which fail WP:NFCC is (almost) as important as fixing or removing unsourced images, for example, except that extra care must be taken with them, which I hope to provide more information about once the page is done. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nOkay, the initial setup should be done. What do you think? –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nThat looks great! I'll be glad to take part. – Quadell (talk)\n\nExcellent! Of course, you can feel free to start at any time. :) I'll probably spam this to a few of the announcements-type locations and WikiProjects to try and find some more interest. –Drilnoth (T • C • L)\n\nYou might want to mention somewhere that just because an image is tagged {{GFDL-self}} doesn't mean that it's not a copyvio. Running through the migration procedure I've come across several images that looked suspicious, and sure enough were straight copyvio rips or slight crops without attribution. Admins, since you can see deleted files, please watch out for and be suspicious of files that were re-uploaded under the same or slightly different names with a GFDL tag appended. Photos of celebrities in particular are prone to this kind of abuse, as people seem to be offended that their favorite celebrity doesn't have a photo, and don't bother to read about promo copyright templates or fair use. \"If I tag it GFDL-self it will go through!\" Bad. --RabidDeity (talk)\n\nWould welcome comments on proposal to address list of photo requests of people. See User:Traveler100/bio-photo-bot for details.Traveler100 (talk)\n\nHi. There's a request at WT:COPYCLEAN for review of an image uploader who may have placed extensive vios on the project. If anybody has time and inclination to help out, the matter is listed here. Thanks. :) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nDo we have any policies on including images that are OR? Apparently these can't be deleted from Commons for this reason. As far as I know, we have no policies on these images actually being used; all of our criteria are for inclusion on content, not usage or linking. Am I wrong about this? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nHey all. As knowledgeable people, I'd like to know what you thought about my petition (regardless of whether you can sign it or not). Cheers, - Jarry1250 [ In the UK? Sign the petition! ]\n\nI am pretty sure it is against wikipedia rules I suspect something in WP:ADVOCACY applies.MilborneOne (talk)\n\nWell, no-one's complained yet. \"Advocacy is the use of Wikipedia to promote personal beliefs or agendas at the expense of Wikipedia's goals\". Given the similarity of goals, I think this flies cleanly under the radar. - Jarry1250 [ In the UK?

Should Rorschach test display all ten images used in the test and the common responses, or should we act on psychologists' concerns that doing so undermines the test? SlimVirgin talk|contribs\n\nWe have some bots controlling the usage of the image in pages. Please note that due to the recent enabled image move code, icw bugzilla:18017, it might be that some of these bots are broken, and might start putting up images for deletion in the next week. I'm not sure who is running the bots atm. but a moved image like File:The Frog Prince soundtrack album cover.jpeg redirect File:05 A01a.jpeg will be affected I assume. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nHow would people here feel about merging Wikipedia:Non-free content review and WP:Possibly unfree files into WP:File license review (or maybe WP:File usage review)? Like PUF and NFCR it would be a discussion forum more than a deletion forum, but it could still result in a delete. Please also see Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Fair use review. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nIs there a way to include very wide image such that the horizontal scrollbar starts at the right (not left) end of the image? An example where this is useful would be Japanese handscrolls like File:Hell Scroll Nara.jpg which are read from the right to the left. bamse (talk)\n\nNo, the scrollbars functionality depends on the browser and operating system used by the user. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nEven for templates like Template:Wide image or Template:Panorama? Just to make sure, I don't mean the browser scrollbars but those integrated scrollbars just next to the image. bamse (talk)\n\nCorrect. Those scrollbars are also created by the operating system. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nI see. Thanks for the fast reply. bamse (talk)\n\nUpper Murray Football League was tagged for copypaste concerns. The text is sufficiently clear, but I'm really confused by the number of logos. These are not being used under FUR, but are uploaded (by the same user) on Commons as \"public domain, self.\" Now, if I could find variants of those elsewhere on the web, I would tag for copyright concerns. I suppose it's possible he's making up his own logos?

I expect the change will be implemented in the very near future and will hopefully inspire a flurry of image-related gnoming, as countless articles have been populated with often random forced sizes over recent months and years. In many cases, thumb sizes have been forced to 220-250px anyway; it's also true that a considerable number of registered users may have already set >200px in their user prefs. This notwithstanding, it's going to be good not only to remove this forcing in mainspace use, there's an opportunity here to initiate a taskforce charged with auditing image use and placement in general. I was kind of wondering if this might be a good place to base that activity... looking around, I think it would be very happy here :-)\n\nAs forced thumb markup has (more often than not) been done to improve article layout and image visibility, some sensitivity, combined with a good eye for layout is required in our gnomery. A taskforce probably needs to agree standards and methodology, discuss scripting and bot potential, and possibly coaching wannabe gnomes in the best practice, with more than half an eye on IUP and MOS.\n\nI'll leave it there for now to hopefully spark some discussion along those lines.\n\nBest, mikaultalk\n\nI second what Mick says.

Category:Wikipedia files that transclude the Non-free media rationale template with no Purpose specified has taken a tremendous jump in the last day, with thousands of articles now outstanding, evidently due to a repair in {{Logo fur}}.

Any assistance in knocking down some of that scary backlog would be appreciated! --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nOn a regular basis someone gets motivated to tag images with {{Non-free reduced}}. There is however no advice with this template on what is a good size. How big can an image be that contains fair-use copyrighted content? More to the point when only part of the image contains copyrighted content how many pixels are acceptable. Could someone point me to simple and clear guidelines on this? --Traveler100 (talk)\n\nNon-admins can't update the description pages of protected images. This means that such pages usually lack links to other versions of the image, and they lack categorization etc. This can also lock out the uploader himself from updating the description, which can be very frustrating and might discourage further image uploads. (I know from personal experience.)\n\nI have a solution for this. It is the same solution that we have used for protected templates for years now. I would like to start using and promote using the {{documentation}} template on protected file pages. I have done the necessary code updates so all the technical stuff is in place.

(By default, the upload page fills out the form for the FUR, but never adds the right license)\n\nIf the image is properly tagged and is fair-use and not used, it will take note of the image and go back an hour later to see if it is used. If it's still orphaned, it is tagged with {{Di-orphaned fair use}} and the uploader is notified\n\nThe part of the bot that can identify problem images is nearly done, it's currently running in userspace. The templates used in notifying users are going to be made soon. I would like everyone's opinion on the process so far, and input as to what could be changed. Thanks. FinalRapture - † ☪\n\nSounds like a reasonable idea at first glance.\n\nFirst thing that springs to mind: is something like this already in use on Commons? Might avoid wheel reinvention, or, alternately, be of use there. Of course, Commons has an upload wizard that tries to steer people in the right direction. But Commons still gets something like 10% of uploads that are shoot-on-sight policy violations. At worst, a complex upload procedure puts off those of good faith and doesn't impede those of bad faith in the slightest (WP:PRAC - you can't regulate stupid or evil out of existence), so a bot that tries to help after upload may (to my mind) help us keep more n00bs.\n\nAnyway. Looks like a potentially good idea to me - David Gerard (talk)\n\nHi. Commons does not have an efficient upload watching bot. AFAIK, only the pictures missing a license are automatically tagged as such, and of course the unfree license tags (fair use, etc) automatically result in a speedy deletion template. What is proposed here seems very specific to the unfree content policy of Wikipedia, and is not applicable to Commons, as unfree content is out of scope there. Automating the recent upload watch on Commons seams a bit difficult, since it relies mostly on the trained eye and research capabilities of a few admins, but we are of course open to suggestions... Tagging images with empty source fields may probably be considered interesting, but it would also lead to false positives and pissed occasional users. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nThe information template on commons automatically detects empty source, permission and description fields (no bot needed). Assuming of course the information template is used, which it automatically is when the image is uploaded through our modified upload form. --Dschwen\n\nBut without any bot action, the uploaders are never notified in those cases. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nIf you don't want to reinvent the wheel : Customize and improve http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/checkimages.py?view=markup (part of pywikipedia). multichill (talk)\n\nThaks, I know about that script but I'd rather recode it in PHP.

Cliques are such a problem. Most people don't want to be fulltime admins like some admins. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nCommons admins? Only enwiki admins can delete images on enwiki. As far as I know there are more admins on enwiki than on Commons. If you find bad transfers (fair use perhaps) just tag it with a speedy and we will delete it on Commons. Some of us do not mind to help you of course but 1) we have enough backlogs on commons and 2) we need an admin-flag to do it :-) --MGA73 (talk)\n\nOh, in case someone wonders: Having a bot delete these files is not an option. multichill (talk)\n\nUpdate:Looks like not everyone agrees with that - Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Hamlet Prince of Robots. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nI think they used a script or AWB to do this, and moved every image with a \"move to Commons\" tag. This user is blocked for 3 days there for moving these images, so don't expect these categories to grow too much any more. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nClarification on that point: The user is blocked at commons (Block Log @ Commons). Peachey88 (Talk Page · Contribs)\n\nQuick question. So its not advised moving images from en wiki to commons in bulk? I thought I was helping the community until I saw the block notice. --Sreejith K (talk)\n\nHi. From the point of view of a Commons admin (it is I who have blocked you), no, it is not desirable, because the files should be checked manually prior to the move: some are missing a source, some are credited to a person other than the uploader and therefore missing an OTRS permission (these issues are more easily resolved by local users while the files are still on their home wiki), some are actually fair use pictures, some are copyright violations for reasons more or less obscure. It is ok to make mistakes of course, you're not expected to know everything about everything (neither are we, I hope), but \"blind\" bulk uploads don't help. In your case in particular, it is pretty hard to watch your file moves (because they don't appear in your contribs), so it is difficult to check all of them (and we're not done). It is really time-consuming for the few admins on the case... Also see the note I've left on your Commons talk page about unblocking. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nI don't know if it's bot assisted moves, but a lot of times, I'm seeing images moved to Commons that are crediting the person who moved it to Commons in addition to or instead of the en uploader. Didn't there used to be a bot that would correctly generate the description pages and copy everything, including OTRS, etc? --B (talk)\n\nIt is true that the moving bots do not generate image pages in the proper final format. However, to the best of my knowledge they do not lose any information (when properly used), and they provide a reference to the user having moved the media. The latter is needed in case there is an issue with the file. But the \"cleaning up\" of the bot output is indeed tedious, and not automated (I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be, but it generates a huge and pretty much ignored backlog). --Eusebius (talk)\n\nI sometimes move images with a bot. You still have to check images before and after the transfer. Bulk uploads can be ok because you can use the bot to fix errors that are on many transfers (fixing syntax and removing bad templates). The best thing would be that uploader scans the uploads and start tagging fair use and copyvios for speedy deletion. That will ofcourse demand a unblock but if normally we do not block users that are willing to cleanup.\n\nIt will take some time to cleanup but as long as enwiki admins do not delete the originals then everyone can help. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nAbout unblock: certainly, I have explained on his talk page that he can be unblocked on request. He was blocked because otherwise it would have been impossible to deal with the mass moves (he didn't react to messages and warnings). EDIT: block now lifted. About bot moves: why move a file on Commons and then tag it as fair use, instead of checking the file on WP and removing the \"move to Commons\" tag? But of course, as soon as one checks the files at some point, the bot in itself is not a major issue. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nI used my bot to find recent uploads that are possibly fair use and added them to commons:Category:Other_speedy_deletions.\n\nFiles that are (possibly) fair use (non free) should of course NOT be moved to Commons unless you are really sure it is really a free image. But now that they are on Commons we should try to find and fix them fast. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nMany of these images tagged for deletion are PD Text (likeFile:FBC logo.svg), and an image I uploaded (File:'Banyan - Study', etching by --Huc-Mazelet Luquiens--, 1922, --Hawaii State Art Museum--.JPG) that was created in the US in 1922. Are all Commons Helper uploads now suspect? What is the criteria that is being used? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nAlso many images are listed as \"no source\" when they were take by the uploader (File:Don't panic.JPG). Please keep in mind that the images were uploaded with all of the info that they had on WP, and that each image had already been tagged to be moved to Commons, so severe problems should be the exception here. ▫ JohnnyMrNinja\n\nHi. The first two are bot actions, and like all bot actions they must be checked before any deletion. They were checked, and the files weren't deleted of course. The \"don't panic\" file was tagged (by me) as missing a permission because the credited author was not the uploader's username, and I could find no \"identity claim\" on his user page. MGA73 removed the problem tag because the link seemed obvious to him. This is exactly the kind of issue that should be solved (or cleared) on WP before the move, because working cross-wiki is not automated and may lead to too undue deletions. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nMy bot found almost 200 images that was identified as possibly fair use. So far it seems that it is better than expected and many (most?) images are ok after all. That is good news. Question is now if we should check those 200 images manually or we should make the bot remove the speedy-tag again.\n\nAs for the no source/permission problem tagging with a \"no source/permission detected\" is in many cases the same as a speedy deletion because if it was uploaded ages ago then original uploader might not be active and see the problem or in cases like this the original uploader is not the same as the person who transfered the image to Commons. So with these old images it might be better to start a deletion request because that way more users are involved and will debate the status. In many cases PD-self has been used by uploaders when it is own work. Now we would like users to write \"own work\" but in 2005 or 2006 that might not be the case. Therefore we should either nuke it or AGF and asume that is own work. I removed a few \"no xxx\" and changed one to a deletion request. If someone thinks that my removal was a mistake I suggest a formal deletion request so that \"no source/permission\" is only used in obvious cases. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nJust to let people know that I've been working on the following list of images at User:Chzz/dsc (which I also cross-posted at WP:AN) which contain images starting with the prefix \"DSC\" – a common format used in file names for Sony digital cameras. There are about 2300 files total, and I have been moving a few of them to Commons using the Move-to-commons assistant under more descriptive filenames.

Can anyone here give him some help and encouragement, and perhaps some advice on batch uploading - I know that it's better to have a descriptive filename for each image, but other editors won't be able to identify the subjects until the images are uploaded – any advice? I really don't want to discourage him from contributing the photographs, simply because he may find the procedures too complex. --RexxS (talk)\n\nThis sounds very encouraging. I would check with WP:WikiProject Malaysia and WP:WikiProject Animals to see if you can find volunteers who would be willing to go through and help identify the subjects of the photos. Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nThank you, that is done. I have no experience of batch uploading, so could I ask if anyone here would be willing to spend a little time to coach User:Frugivore (talk) on the process, please? --RexxS (talk)\n\nI put a proposal at Template talk:NowCommons#Improve NowCommons. multichill (talk)\n\nOk so, what I need done probably isn't nearly as complicated as a true HDR.

Beyond My Ken (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nHaving just read the profile of WikiProject Images and Media in the latest Signpost, I happened to stumble across the article on the new BBC TV show Rev., which, like many articles on TV series or episodes, has only fair use images (and often with dubious fair use rationales). It occurred to me that the BBC and other state broadcasters (e.g. NRK) have aims that are at least somewhat compatible with the goals of Wikipedia and Commons; being state funded, some times with some sort of licensing fee levied on television equipment or similar arrangements, they have goals like furthering culture, education, and arts. In other words, there are several reasons to think they should or could be positive to some sort of collaboration with Wikipedia and/or Commons. So I wonder, has any effort at outreach been made towards these organizations?\n\nAs one example, I'd envision it might be fruitful to approach the BBC, possibly by way of its graphics department, about setting up a long-term partnership wherein they routinely and actively supply us with promotional images of TV production title screens, images of principal cast (typically promotional images), and individual actors in a role, all, of course, under a free license. In a perfect world one might even hope to see short video clips or audio segments released under a free license for similar reasons, but I imagine that would be a much harder nut to crack. The broadcaster, in this case the BBC, would ensure the graphics accompanying the articles on their productions are of good quality and well represent their efforts, which will probably repay the (hopefully very small) investment of resources in the form of positive exposure (\"public relations\" is not only advertising!). It would need to be a long-term strategy because the process on both sides would need to be fleshed out and established to ensure smooth running, and because I imagine there are any number of practical and legal hurdles the BBC would need to clear before being able to put such a system into practice even if they're immediately enthusiastic about the idea. The biggest problem there, I would imagine, is that the BBC in many cases would be not the producer, but a licensee, of a particular production; and thus would need to get various releases and such from the actual production company. However, long term, if something like this could be got off the ground, this might be a sufficiently positive arrangement for all parties that standard terms and contracts are amended to facilitate such an arrangement as a matter of course.\n\nAnyways, it struck me—and I may be wrong of course—that state broadcasters such as the BBC have, if a mutually beneficial partnership can be established, enormous potential for long term benefit for Images and Media on Wikipedia and Commons, for a relatively small ongoing labour cost (for all involved); could potentially have very positive secondary effects and raise awareness of these issues; would serve as golden examples to use in discussions with other kinds of media organizations (commercial broadcasters, Hollywood in general, museums, etc.); and might be very effective \"low-hanging fruit\" for the project to invest in. A \"win-win\" situation, in other words.\n\nI'm not sufficiently versed in the issues involved to be much help in such an effort, and the random thoughts above may be hopelessly naive and lacking in relevant history—so do feel free laugh derisively at my expense, I promise I shan't be offended :-)—but I figured I'd drop a note here to see if anyone thought the idea worth pursuing. Cheers, --Xover (talk)\n\nAs you may know by now there is an issue with wikipedia's use of a scalable FBI seal. Wikipedia's attorney, godwin, defend's its use. But there are several issues, 1- unwanted attention, 2- the tag on the image page states that it is insufficient. I am wondering if it is better for users to propose a consensus on making a lower image res. either way yall's input is desired. two conversations here and here.

Tim Pierce (talk)\n\nThe two very large categories have now been reduced to below 10000 article and I can see how I can make further impact on Category:Wikipedia requested photographs of sportspeople, however I am finding it difficult to identify templates that will have an impact on Category:Wikipedia requested photographs of people. Does anyone know of a tool that will go through a category and summarise the template used in the pages. What I need is a list with how often each template is used in the people category, can then add this to the program and move those pages to a subcategory. Any other suggestions on identifying pages? --Traveler100 (talk)\n\nI have identified another method of selecting page, see User:People-n-photo-bot#Specification 2 (proposal). Welcome comments before running. --Traveler100 (talk)\n\nWhat on earth is the problem with the image on the page George Lloyd (bishop)? Why does it not show? DBD\n\nRight now it shows just fine.

Is there a method by which an editor may request the services of an expert on image manipulation? Specifically, to clean the watermark off an image which has already been uploaded.\n\nI am asking on behalf of Drnsreedhar1959 (talk · contribs), who asked me \"I have posted a few more pictures. But they contain watermark. Unfortunately, all the images I have in my album have them and I am unable to remove. It is welcome if someone is able to do that.\" --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI uploaded some images to Wikipedia and now cannot find them. Is there an entryway somewhere to get into the collection of images? Yours, GeorgeLouis (talk)\n\nThis is not quite the best place to ask but when you are logged in, just click on \"my contributions\" at the top right of any page to see your edits which includes all file uploads, so long as they have not been deleted. ww2censor (talk)\n\nThat will list edits in all namespaces. There are two ways to restrict this to files only (whether image files or sound files):\n\nIn the \"Search for contributions\" box, find the \"Namespace\" drop-down menu, and select \"File\", then click \"Search\". This will list both uploads and subsequent edits (amended descriptions etc).\n\nAt the bottom of the \"my contributions\" page you should find a \"Files uploaded\" link, which will show just the uploaded image files, omitting all the subsequent edits.\n\n--Redrose64 (talk)\n\nHow do I add an image from a Wikipedia article in an other language to English Wikipedia? I will like to add an image that is on a luxembourgish article to an English article.--MFIreland • Talk\n\nWhat is the luxembourgish article concerned, and which image in that article are we dealing with? The thing is, whether you can use the image easily or not depends upon where it's held. To find out, go to the relevant article page, and click on the image to get to the image description page. Immediately below the image itself is the info on its resolution; just below that, there may be a box stating something like \"This is a file from the Wikimedia Commons. ...\". If there is nothing like that, it's almost certainly on the local wikipedia.\n\nIf it's held on Commons, you can link to it just like any other image; but if it's on the Lux wikipedia, you have two options: (i) if it's a free-use image, get it transferred to commons; (ii) if it's non-free use, copy it to English Wikipedia and set up a fair-use rationale. Further info at Wikipedia:Uploading images#Multiproject upload. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThe Luxembourgish image is Fichier:Arméi oofzeechen.jpg from the article Lëtzebuerger Arméi and its not on commons.
