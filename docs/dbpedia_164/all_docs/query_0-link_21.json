In these tapes, Swami Krishna Deva, the mayor of Rajneespuram, Oregon, talks with John Mathis, a mediator with the federal Community Relations Service. He prods Mathis for details about a secret federal investigation. Since these tapes were recorded by the FBi, i assume that they are in the public domain. As such, would someone please upload these five files in ogg format? I just thought these would be an interesting addition to articles related to the Rajneesh movement. Thanks.\n\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/rajneesh/index.ssf/documents.html\n\nJoyson Noel Holla at me\n\nDone, see File:Rajneesh-Part1.ogg - File:Rajneesh-Part5.ogg. sısɐuuǝɔıʌ∀ (diskuto)\n\nGreat job, Avicennasis (talk · contribs)!!! I have added them into a category, Category:Federal Bureau of Investigation audio files on Rajneesh movement. -- Cirt (talk)\n\nThanks Avicennasis! :-) Joyson Noel Holla at me\n\nHmm... the FBI created the recording. But don't the two people talking have some kind of copyright to their conversation? It's probably not important in this case, as it was published in 1984, most likely without a copyright notice. But it might be interesting for similar files. --Kam Solusar (talk)\n\nIn short, no, unless they wrote a script for their conversation beforehand. Only fixed (or tangible) works (recordings, documents, photos) attract copyright, rather than speeches per se. It is a rather complicated issue, discussed fully at [1]. Note that although at first that article seems to imply copyright, it is mainly asserting that the recorder would have a copyright, which would be the FBI; and that unfixed speeches are unlikely to attract copyright themselves. That's my take on it, anyway, but IANAL. Jarry1250 (talk)\n\nIs it possible to upload the scans of FBI and federal government documents on Commons? If so, then i request someone to upload whichever documents (in the link) falls under the public domain. Thanks. Joyson Noel Holla at me\n\nNo, not me! However, I'm sure we've all come across that response, when suggesting that someone might donate images to Commons (and the related \"if someone wants to use my images commercially, they should pay me!\"). And we all, I hope, know good answers. But has anyone compiled them, as a FAQ or blog post (here or elsewhere) to which we can point people? I can't see anything on Commons:Welcome or Commons:FAQ. Andy Mabbett (talk)\n\nWe do, at Commons:Licensing/Justifications. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nJust upload an ugly picture of them to Commons and tell them if they want a nice one they have to open license it. That argument usually works. -Nard (Hablemonos)(Let's talk)\n\nI do think a good essay could be written on this. I don't have it all figured out, but have learned some things, the hard way. For one thing, just using the Wiki \"standard request\" generally leads to problems with the OTRS not satisfied that the releaser understands the donations is to Creative Commons (very \"free\"). I try to spell it out ahead of time and actually get them to give me a repeat back that satisfies the rights po-lice. I also usually say something complementary about their image or work in general. Maybe a phrase or sentence on how the thing is going to be used (the article, but have to be clear that it's not a one time donation). TCO (talk)\n\nJune 30\n\nHi! .PPT files are not accepted by the Commons Well, the NTSB website has some PD PPT presentations: http://web.archive.org/web/20090228182953/http://ntsb.gov/Events/2000/Aka261/presentations/presentations.htm What format should PPT files be converted into? WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nPDF. PowerPoint has a Save as PDF feature that can accomplish this reasonably well. Dcoetzee (talk)\n\nThank you so much! I just created the PDF files! WhisperToMe (talk)\n\n(fr) Bonjour, (be) une fois !\n\nSome Users, here, are moving Coats of arms Files to – they say – better categories, e. g. here, creating subcategories for each village, « Category:Coats of arms of placename ».\n\nAs a village – even a city – has one and only one Crest, there is no need to such hypercategorization ! (This prefix, « hyper- », means that an action seems to be better, but is in fact wrong ; e. g. « hyperurbanism », when Late Romans spoke a bad Latin – Urbs ! – they thought correct because of its sophistication…) If a town has in its story more than one CoA, we may therefore create such categories ; but this one ?… here ?… Etc.\n\nBudelberger (talk) .\n\n(Moved here from talk.) —innotata\n\nWell, it could be for having multiple images of the same thing. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\n\"has one and only one Crest\" - why so? Sure, today it has one official blazon and (presume) one official graphics, but there could be historical versions; there could be COAs per se and photographs of COA in sculpture, murals etc. Even Klenov already has three files, then what about Category:Coats of arms of the City of London Corporation ? NVO (talk)\n\nBoth approaches, the one complaining about hypercategorization, and the ones explaining the need for subcategories, are pertinent. There has to be some good sense on this, however. I've seen such categories being created with only one item inside. In my opinion this is unnecessary and counter productive. Those items can perfectly be in the village category and in \"CoA of municipalities of ...\", no need to create a proper category there. However, in the cases where multiple representations of that coat of arms (or historical versions of it) exist here in Commons it is indeed helpful to create a subcategory, or even a number of them, to place them.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nI often try to sort out stuff from Category:Media needing categories and use hot cat. If I find a file called coat of arms of x, then I try to add it to the Category:coat of arms of x. If this fails to come up in HotCat then I might have a fiddle looking for alternate spellings of x, and then when this fails I just add the file to Category:coat of arms of country y. My geographic skills are not good enough to be able to work out which subdivision of country y to add the file to. The choice is to put up with files getting into the higher categories and having to be moved down, or having categories at the lowest level. I would expect there are very few subjects where you would expect only one file, so creating the category now with the correct name and position in the hierarchy for single files will reap future benefits. Railwayfan2005 (talk)\n\nNo, frankly I don't think that way. There are hundreds of thousands of CoA of villages and other locations. Creating categories for single items in that case is really unhelpful, and hinders categorization, since you have to fiddle with the whole category instead of a single file, which is much more difficult and can't be done by tools like cat-a-lot. It's really counter-productive. In the case you mention, IMO the CoA should be placed primarily in the village category, which is where it will be searched for. Then you may place it as well somewhere in the CoA tree, even if it is at the top category it is useful, but creating a category for those single items in that case is indeed bad practice, IMO.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nPart of the problem. I have brought this up in the past as an article writer, Commons USER. What we need is some \"botton\" that you click and then all the subordinate categories are displayed. It's insane that when I'm looking for some type of animal and there are 10 pics at the higher level, but in 5 categories, to have to click, click, click, each separate one. give me a button that allows auto decategorizing and much of the pain is taken away.TCO (talk)\n\nIt depends on the case. A while ago I organized Category:Hindu temples in Bhubaneswar, which was a complete mess, with only the Lingaraj temple as subcat (with a lot of erroneous pictures inside) and the rest floating in the main cat, the majority of the pictures attributed to the wrong temple and erroneously used in wiki-en. Upon finding a reliable database of photos from those temples, I endeavoured the sorting of that mess, and managed to find the rich variety of temples you can now find there. I can say it was a very rewarding and amusing experience, almost a game. You will note that some of the temples only have one picture inside. I've done this on purpose, since they are less known temples, and it's identification was more difficult. Of course you lost there the \"big picture\" about the assortment of Hindu temples in Bhubaneswar, but I believe that's not the use of categories, but galleries. I'm not interested in galleries and I doubt I ever will be, but people who find them useful may create them picking the images from the sorted categories in order to give the \"big picture\" about some item, let it be an animal or the variety of Hindu temples in Bhubaneswar.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nYou'll have a button if you place {{Category tree}} in the content for the category itself. – Adrignola talk\n\n{{Category tree}} is now redundant because the software now automatically displays all the subcategories of a particular category on one page. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI suspect TOC may be asking for something that also allows to see all the images in the subcategories. That would be a great improvement for me, too.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nCat Scan allows you to see all the images subcategories, an example of the images in Category:Hindu temples in Bhubaneswar and subcategories: [2]. MKFI (talk)\n\n(you're not getting me.) I know that I can see the subcats. What I want is a reversible mechanism to view the larger population of images. Am trying to save myself clicks. Imagine having a category of \"painted turtle\" with 2 images in the category and then 4 subcategories for subspecies (each containing subspecies). If I just want a general picture of a painted turtle I have to click all the subcategories. I would like a button to just be able to expand the view all at once, to see all the images in subcats and the parent cat. I'm not saying to permanently scrap the micro-cats. They can have use. However, I really do USE COMMONS. And it is a better resource for me...for article WRITERS, with some better features around search and layout. Don't get me wrong, this is a great place. Still...be very aware that this place is mostly a service resource for other people...and the easier for USERS, not just uploaders, the better. :-) TCO (talk)\n\nMKFI just showed above how you can do it. Follow his link, and you'll get the idea.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nDidn't mean to shake my rattle. I do appreciate the assist and may use that tool in the future. That said, I really think something simpler, where you can just click on the page and it expands the views down a branch lower (or all the way) is desired. that's a pretty daunting looking window. Realize that the most usage of Commons is writers looking for photos to illustrate Wiki articles, not computer programmers. :-) TCO (talk)\n\n[...] most usage of Commons is writers looking for photos to illustrate Wiki articles, not computer programmers.\n\nTCO, have you tried to use the Add Media Wizard for that? Take a look on this screenshot ;-) Helder 21:50, 1 July 2011 (UTC)\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.\n\nFurther details and educational materials will be available shortly. The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.

This would help low-bandwidth users as well as those with specific objections. My hope is that at some low resolution - 20 pixels if need be - there is simply no picture that will be viewed as intensely objectionable. I wish your referendum would investigate in this direction rather than pressing for people to \"neutrally\" place ideological ratings on specific images. Wnt (talk)\n\nAs you're probably aware, there is already a per-user preference for logged-in users (see \"Thumbnail size\" under Special:Preferences/Appearance/Files), for cases where \"thumb\" is specified for an image but no image size is given. The list of values is limited by MediaWiki. We could probably file a bug to ask for the ability for the user setting to override cases where image size is given, but I suspect there's good reason it's done that way, and anyway it would probably take ages for anything to happen. Plus, per : 1340, gallery thumb sizes are still handled separately ( : 3276 made the width of the gallery adapt to the user's screen). Finally, I doubt reducing all images to \"can't tell what it is\" size is much of a solution for most people who want some control over hiding certain types of image. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI assume filters would rely on proper tagging of those \"particular types of images\". I wonder whose job that will be. Also does anybody know what \"particular types of images\" are we talking about? I assume nudity, but what else? Grisly corpses, executions, Depictions of Muhammad, LGBT, Adult diapers, Kittens? It seems to me there is a lot of \"particular types\" of images that can be offensive. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nMust not forget about alcohol, hate/discrimination, mutilation/torture, weapons, German youth protection, health/medical, drugs, gambling, lingerie/bikini, religious, sexuality, and tobacco related images. – Adrignola talk\n\nA warning for you all, do not simply add \"Category:Sex\" to it, because you will censor every picture of anything which is identifiably male, female or other, and 10,000,000 old paintings. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nThe upload bots might add the words sex, porno, paedophilia, ... in a random combination and languages to all uploaded files.

Unfortunately the corps flickr account photo says \"All Rights Reserved\" http://www.flickr.com/photos/55127822@N07/5887813113 But it is definitely a U.S. government creation (which is also mentioned in its caption) and thus cannot be copyrighted.

Powers (talk)\n\nHi to all: I'm working on church categories in Italy, for a better and multi-subcategorized categories (for diocese and patron saint), and I find a lot of deconsecrated churches (but not only in Italy) I think be worth in this different category. However many now laical buildings are categorized in Category:Secularized churches. Is only a problem of linguistic shades from italian? What the better word in english?--Threecharlie (talk)\n\nIn additoin we have cats Former churches (sort of mother cat) and Abandoned churches. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nHmm.. There is a difference between deconsecrated churches and secularized churches. The later implies that they were reused in some secular function (like a disco, or a shop, or whatever), and should be a subcat of deconsecrated churches.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nI can see the distinction between \"abandoned\" and \"reused\", however, they often come together (\"abandoned and later reused\" or \"reused and then abandoned\"). Which one should prevail? And then, all too often, there's no <easily available> records. We know that it stood abandoned for the last hundred years, but how did it happen, precisely? So the editors are left to decide on their own, and similar cases will end up here or there based on each editor's own judgement. There already is a multiple-choice riddle about ruins (Ruins, Abandoned, Derelict) already, no need to reproduce more ambiguities. NVO (talk)\n\nI would presume 'abandoned' should be a subcat of 'former', and would specifically mean that it is not currently in use. But, yes, I can see that it would be a problem for categorizing a church (rather than a photo) over time. I would tend to use 'abandoned' more on individual photos. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI've deactivated this Gadget because it converts some word (which I do not typing), after I saving a page.

They are just users, same to ourselves.--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nJuly 7\n\nI would like to catch the idea of «user categories». Let me show some examples of user categories: Category:Photos by Ilya Ilf, Category:Karl Bulla, Category:Photographs by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, Category:Mikhail Evstafiev, Category:Photos by Ilya Varlamov, Category:Photos by Vasiliy Zimin. Why those categories are not marked as user categories? And why some other categories containing the works by modern photographers are labeled as user categories? I studied COM:USER and still cannot understand the difference between user-specific categories and author-specific categories when some photographer acts like a Commons user.--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nBecause Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky died years before the Internet/Commons and didn't upload them himself? -- Docu at\n\nThus the photographer that uploads his art himself is nothing but a user now? -- PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\n\"user\" is meant to mean \"contributor\" and \"artist\" in this context. -- Docu at\n\nWhy artist categories are visible, but user categories are hidden? Why artists alive are worse than dead ones?!--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nBasically, you have to be dead (or exceptionally expensive) before officially recognised as a real artist. --Foroa (talk)\n\nLet's get back to the question: some living wikimedia contributors have \"author categories\" while others must live with \"user categories\". What, precisely, makes User:Zimin.V.G. more equal than others? NVO (talk)\n\nI would say the reason to give artists a category for their works would all be to do with notability. But I don't mean notability to the strictness of wikipedia notability, but simply some notability beyond wikimedia/wikipedia. If it is a collection of images from some external source, then a category or gallery of those images is useful if for no other reason than to easily verify whether we already have a copy of that image - maybe it is a maintenance category. If an artist (eg photographer) uploads all their own images here, then there are galleries of their material available via the Gallery tool. So I think a collection of images of a flickr user account may have a gallery/category, even if they are otherwise un-notable. But if the entire contents of a gallery/category are uploaded here directly by the author, unless they really are wiki-notable, we don't really need a main-space gallery/category. --Tony Wills (talk)\n\nNB I cleaned up a lot of user category entries recently, and may have moved some legitimate mainspace categories into user-category space, feel free to revert any changes that I made in error :-) --Tony Wills (talk)\n\nPersonally, I think author categories for users should be displayed in the same way as for others.\n\nThis should apply to categories in the basic format (e.g. \"Photographs by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky\"). I'm not convinced of the utility of subcategories in these for every 10 images.\n\nThe main problem we have today is that we can't easily identify topical categories from other categories other than by tagging them as \"hidden\". The \"hidden\" attribute should eventually just move them to a new line, but currently it doesn't. If we mixed all of them with topical categories, it just gets messy.\n\nTo have user categories display for all users, a workaround used by some is through a link in a user template. This has the added benefit that it's also accessible from Wikipedia. -- Docu at\n\nI was just reviewing the categories listed by PereslavlFoto, and it occurs to me that there really is not a problem for us. If a user creates a category for their images, and doesn't mark it as a {{User category}} then they have relinquished all control of it. Like any other category it is subject to editing by any user and may be out-right deleted if it is seen as out of scope or otherwise unwanted. If they mark it as a {{User category}}, then it will in general be left alone, and they can add/delete images etc to their hearts content. If they want everyone to be able to find their category they can add a link from their user-page. So there really is not anything that needs to be specifically policed. For those not marked {{User category}} send them to {{Cfd}} if they are seen as unwanted, and decide on a case by case basis. --Tony Wills (talk)\n\nTony Wills: it's an interesting turn. No doubt that \"Like any other category, [user category not marked with {{User category}}] is subject to editing by any user\". But what (apart from personal ethics) precludes such editing when {{User category}} is in place? Commons:User-specific galleries, templates and categories policy is silent about it. Proposed Commons:User categories is dormant since January.NVO (talk)\n\nI think that the problem is that the user hates hidden categories for his works. He might think that nobody will see him or find him less important. (He reverted several times the user cats) --Foroa (talk)\n\nThis is far from truth, because you take emotions for the reason (using the word «hates»). In reality the Commons users cannot understand why do the same photographers have different category types. Is it for discouraging people to join Commons? The reason in not emotion but logic. I beg you to see the problem, not the people pointing to it.--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nIs it for discouraging people to join Commons is a fairly bizarre assumption, as nearly 99.9 % of all new users who are going to join Commons (including myself anno 2006) do neither know the difference between user and photographer categories, nor they (or a lot of them) know what categories are at all. (And, just for the records, even some \"established\" users with some high pretensions seem sometimes not to know how to categorize correctly.) - A.S.\n\n(You are right, I am not a major burial specialist. So back to the question.) — What is the difference between authors and users, and why a photographer publishing at Commons has no right to be a photographer? — (You must know that en:Argumentum ad hominem is a en:Logical fallacy.)--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nUser categories are a concession to users to make them maintenance more easy, user categories are not topics, besides the maintenance aspect there is nothing that makes it acceptable that users include themself in our educational content. Commons is not flickr.com where people build their own photostreams, albums and so on. Some of the above mentioned categories are maybe simply not created correctly, but Category:Mikhail Evstafiev who is considerably notable judging by wiki articles is correct for example. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nIs there any rule distinguishing authors in two groups, the notable ones and the other ones? How can a man catch up what categories are not created correctly? Thank you.--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nI doubt about Flicr, please see the example. A usercat from Flicr user is treated as photography category.--PereslavlFoto (talk)\n\nThis is kind of a broad concern. I see a large warning on our DOE template that works of National Labs may not be PD. And as far as I know, they are most or all run by contractors. (Some of the lab websites have a copyright notice, some don't. Also, for example, Ames, clarifies that the USG has a non-transferable right to publish all their images...so even seeing something on the DOE site might not be assurance that it is PD as general, they might just be exercising their right, but not ours for lab image republishing!) We have a LOT of images from National Labs. I am seeing them in Featured Articles at en-Wiki and the like. (It's not an isolate thing.) I pretty much LOVE these images. But also have this concern that we are broadly non-compliant. Appreciate any thoughts, not just on \"the rules\", but also practical things to make sure we're using compliant images (and that I not rule out good pictures.) P.s. I guess I could just throw a bunch of important pics into Deletions and get insight that way, but thought I would ask here first! :-)\n\nSome pics (must be more):\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xenon_tetrafluoride.gif (from a DOE website, but the pic was taken at Argonne)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uraniumtetrabomb.jpg (this is at Wiki, but y'all are the experts, plus you know eventually it will be here! ;-))\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oak_Ridge_Y-12_Alpha_Track.jpg (has impressive sounding justification and perhaps is by a USG photog, perhaps not, ORNL is a NL and was run by a contractor)\n\nTCO (talk)\n\nVery legitimate concern, I think. However, the latter two you mention are Manhattan project photos (pre-dating the private involvement in the national labs I think, which were only created after the war), and the last one explicitly mentions the US Government employee who took the photo, so I don't think there is any issue with those. The first one may be an issue, though apparently being published before 1964 would mean that a copyright renewal would have to be on file at the Copyright Office somewhere for that one. For modern images, however, yes they are a concern (unless it is documented that a US Government employee took them). Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nThanks. Feel better. Guess I still have a mildly persnickety wonder about even MP era photos as the sites were often contractor-run even then. And there must be a difference in the type of contractor. If USG just hires a photog to do some photos, we would treat that as USG property (image made for hire, although even then I guess it would matter the actual contract), but then the labs now, are on Federal land, but are contractor-administered and the employees are not exactly civil servants. But...eh...you made me feel a little better. :-) TCO (talk)\n\nManhattan Project I think would be entirely considered federal employees, or close enough. Contractors/employees may have been loaned by private institutions but the work was definitely only for the federal government, and I don't think they were contractor-run at all. Any photos would have been highly classified anyways. Official private involvement in running the labs themselves only started after the war... 1946/1947. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nThey used contractors even back then. Not sure the nature of the contracts, but say at ORNL, Eastman Chemical (formerly Tennessee Eastman hired several thousand females to work at uranium separation). The work had federal purpose then and after. Perhaps the nature of the contracts differeed (which would be great). But even at LA, there was a definite desire from the beginning to have a bit of an academic atmosphere and Universty of California was the meta-contractor. See the current FAC on Manhattan Project (great article, btw!) I feel a little better with the Wescott photos as he may have been directly contracted by Army History or the like (althouth still unclear).TCO (talk)\n\nI'm going to write to Ames (want to ask for a bigger file anyway, to try to get Featured Picture). Will ask what they know about rights status as well. The thing about 1964 makes me feel pretty good, that this stuff is off copyright from a practical perspective, but will just be interested to see what they say.TCO (talk)\n\nThey said it was PD, but gave me a release anyhow. and bigger pics! Putting them on Wiki since this is where image is now.TCO (talk)\n\nIt's not really about deletion, but about a problem concerning the license ( {{self|Cc-by-sa-3.0}} ) used in :\n\nFile:Allan Manning's Signature.jpg\n\nFile:Allan Manning's Signature.svg (derivative)\n\nUploader is not the author of this, and can't license it with a free license.\n\nScanning something do not create a new copyright => the scanner is not the author of it. What remains is the author of the element represented , here the signature of Allan Manning. But there's a long habit on commons to consider signatures PD Simple (or {{PD-signature}}). Hence, this file can't be licensed with a free license (with self), but should be maybe tagged PD.\n\nLilyu (talk)\n\nThank you Martin H --Lilyu (talk)\n\n{{Should be substituted}} and {{Must be substituted}} appear to serve the same purpose, since the former says \"should always\". Should they be merged? Rd232 (talk)\n\nSupport. I thought of it too. Rehman\n\nAgree. Neutral. No (difference) in parameters as well. I see not much difference if we are using one or two templates--Ben.MQ (talk)\n\nDisagree, looking at the history they were very deliberately created to have different meanings. One marks templates that \"must be\" sustituted because they have a purpose and/or syntax that require them to be. The other is for templates that \"should\" be, but they will work even if you don't. If the distinction hasn't been observed by those applying them, then that is a matter of documentation and education. --Tony Wills (talk)\n\nNope, it still can be merged with the help of a few parameters. Rehman\n\nParameters increase complexity and you'd likely see one of the above turned into a silent call to a combined template with the parameter specified. As in, {{Must be substituted}} would have {{should be substituted|must=yes}} within it. – Adrignola talk\n\nOppose The words do have different meanings, and there is a completely different look. The same user created both, so there is an intended distinction. As noted above, it was already discussed briefly at Commons:Deletion requests/Template:Should be substituted and kept. They have already been translated into a bunch of different languages with their precise meanings; I see almost no benefit to changing things. It's just another template, which is no big deal, and trying to change it creates far more work than will be saved. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nSupport - While the original intent may have been to have two separate templates, the distinction between them is not so significant that we need to maintain two separate templates. The templates largely share the same look, other than the fact that one uses larger text. As Rehman suggests, have one template and use parameters. I actually think it increases complexity to have multiple templates that perform tasks that are only subtly different from one another, rather than having one template that accomplishes a related set of tasks. --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nOppose - subst technically required and subst recommended is a major difference. You can ignore a recommendation for good reasons if you know what you are doing, but things don't work as expected if you ignore a required subst. The effects of a missing required subst could be subtle and unpredictable, from \"breaks if transcluded indirectly\" to \"kills the server if used by more than ten readers simultaneously\". –Be..anyone (talk)\n\nI don't think anyone diagrees that there is a difference. As far as I am concerned, that's not the issue. It's not clear to me how having two separate templates eliminates the risk of confusion between the two, however (if anything, it adds to it). --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nSignificant differences based only on parameter can be just as confusing, IMO. It looks like we would have a situation where based on the parameter, we choose one layout or the other -- there doesn't seem to be much overlap in terms of the template content. If that is the case, we may as well have two templates, and make the difference more apparent in the name. Lastly, there has already been lots of translation work here, and the list of languages in the two templates do not match up. You risk messing up a lot of that work, or at least forcing people to re-do translation work, where everything seems well enough if left alone. If the templates were just being created there *may* be an argument, but at this point... there's hardly a benefit that I can see. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nThe fact that the lists of languages in the two templates do not match up is precisely a major reason why these templates should be merged. Because the two are currently edited independently, seemingly in disregard to the complementary role the two templates play in respect of one another, we now have a situation where, for example, one template is translated into Spanish and the other isn't. So, a Spanish-speaking Commons user only gets half the story. This presumably would not have been a problem with one template. With two templates, you are always at risk of inconsistent and incomplete edits that have no regard for the sister template or the distinction between the two templates. There is tremendous benefit in eliminating that problem, and I disagree that suggestion that the templates work well as is.\n\nAs for overlap, the templates both consist of a box with the same icon. We are not dealing with completely different layouts. We are only talking about a message changing with the parameter. You suggest that we might change the names, but if we were going to that degree of trouble, why would we not just merge them and do things properly? --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nJust as an aside, I wonder how well the existing translations convey the distinction between \"should\" and \"must\". Unless one speaks 10+ languages, it's hard to monitor this. Where only one template has been translated, I suspect there is a good chance that the distinction is lost. Where both templates have been translated into the same language, but by different editors, I also suspect that is a lot of room for confusion. Again, there is less risk of this problem if we have one template that allows users to choose between \"should\" and \"must\" (and thus forces translators to distinguish between the two). --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nWeak support (updated from oppose) — if there's a required parameter for MUST vs. SHOULD as per Skeezix1000 a merged template would in fact help with its i18n. –Be..anyone (talk)\n\nSupport the technical merge of both templates. My experience with templates is that it's much easier to maintain one template with some parameters than a group of distinct templates performing similar things, given that the changes on the \"mother template\" are not very complex, as in this case. From the looks of it, it will be extremely simple to merge them and keep compatibility in the way Adrignola explained above. The separate translations are actually a good reason to merge them, and not the opposite, as has been told above, and I don't believe that merging them will be such a big deal as well.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nSupport. Just to reiterate what I wrote above, you could have {{Must be substituted}} still exist, just calling {{should be substituted|must=yes}} in the underlying code. No difference for end users but far easier for maintenance and new translations. – Adrignola talk\n\nAn optional required=no (or false or 0) with a default required=yes (or true or 1) might be clearer. –Be..anyone (talk)\n\nSure. Just threw one possibility out there. It bothers me not as to what the parameter is eventually named, nor the value. – Adrignola talk\n\nSupport. I was just throwing the possibility out there, but the discussion here suggests a merge would be helpful. It would improve clarity to explain the contrasting meanings of \"should\" and \"must\" in a single place, and would make internationalisation clearer and easier. A template redirect would ensure that no-one used to the status quo need do anything different. Rd232 (talk)\n\nComment - The discussion appears to have wound down, with 6 in support, 1 neutral and 2 opposed. Do Tony or Carl have any further comments/objections? Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nComment I had proceeded on the assumption that both templates were widely used. But in fact \"should\" is used in only 12 templates [3] while \"must\" is used in well over 100 [4]. \"Must\" has many more translations (I've borrowed he and nds from \"should\", which \"should\" had and \"must\" didn't). The distinction between \"must\" and \"should always\" is unclear in English anyway, and the languages I can understand make the distinction even less clear. So I've just redirected \"should\" to \"must\", and anyone who wants to adapt \"must\" to introduce a sort of \"should\" meaning with an optional parameter can do so. Rd232 (talk)\n\nJust as a note... there is a distinction of \"should\" and \"must\" in RFC 2119. I don't think it's in any way \"unclear\". In many circumstances, the difference is significant (which is why all the internet RFCs make sure to use those words carefully). Not sure if the distinction here is important enough to keep the two templates, but it could be -- doesn't sound like \"should\" was widely used. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nMy oppose updated to weak support was inspired by RFC 2119, and much work on m:help subst-topics years ago before I pulled \"right to vanish\" on en:w:/m:/mediazilla: (doesn't affect the new userid here). –Be..anyone (talk)\n\n\"should\" and \"must\" have different meanings in English, that's clear. The distinction between \"should always\" and \"must\" is clear as mud.

The upload seems to have been successful, but the site is still displaying the old version, and Wikipedia articles that link to the image are still showing the old version. I tried refreshing the page, clearing my browser cache, and manually purging the page, but the new version still won't show up. The only way I can display the new version is if I scroll down to the File History section of the page, and click on the new version, and the it will load... but this doesn't solve the problem of the new version not displaying on the main file page or in Wikipedia articles.

(See https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28613, Elder article on village pump). Is there any workaround? --Xypron (talk)\n\nTo my knowledge there are only those workarounds: Only if it is very urgent (e.g. main page or similar) then just embed a slightly different size which wasn't used by anybody before (e.g. 179 instead of 180 px width). This will have the correct thumb. I guess deleting and restoring or simply uploading a duplicate under a new name could help, too. Those work arounds shouldn't be used for non-urgent cases as they are creating work and are non-standard. Just waiting helps. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nFrom my experience, deleting and restoring does nothing to resolve it, but renaming the file solves it, if there is some urgent need.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nI'm having problems with the way text appears in many of my Inkscape submissions and I don't understand why. Image File:Baker's San Felipe Flag.svg should have each word centered down the white stripes of the flag, and not left justified. Also, the font has changed to some sort of default, which I didn't specify. On File:San Jacinto Flag.svg, two of the words are showing up on the ribbon over the sword but a dark rectangle appears where a third word, \"Liberty\" should be. I was about to upload another submission, but the thumbnail showed another dark rectangle over the text.

Please see Commons_talk:Username_policy#Test_case.\n\nThe issue is that some Wikipedia projects, like English Wikipedia, discourage group accounts such as those which might be used by anyone at an organization. My question is whether Wikipedia Commons supports such accounts. It seems to me that an organization might have media files which it could be willing to upload, and an organization account would be the most appropriate kind of account for doing this.\n\nHowever, the global login created might be problematic for its existence on some Wikimedia projects.

Incidentally, even with the low res in your image I was able to see that the last crop was better than mine, and tested deleting and restoring the image, to see if it would change something, but I'm still seeing the border version.

Thank Shooke (Talk me in spanish, english or italian)\n\nI can rename it again, if there is a need for that and there is no opposition. If LocationSouthSudan.svg is the best final name, I may issue an universal replacement for the file name as well (I have not done it for the current name, since it was meant to be a temporary fix only).-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nI don't know why people cannot be patient and upload a new version using a new file name. You broke the sense, mainly in Wikinews articles where the old map was so far used to show both Sudan and South Sudan in one map which the 2007 version was the only useful map. There a different usages of maps.

If the template exists at the Creative Commons site, it will be created here. Some messages are still missing (see for example {{Cc-by-3.0-cr}}). I'll add them to Translatewiki later. Expect these messages to show up in the next couple of weeks. Multichill (talk)\n\nHi! There has been a little debate regarding the usage of Japanese names.\n\nUser_talk:Aphaia#Naming\n\nUser:Aphaia appears on several photographs posted to the Wikimedia Commons. I altered image descriptions, a category name, and category content so that the name reads as \"Naoku Kizu\" instead of \"Kizu Naoko\" to make the name order consistent with pages/categories/etc of other post-Meiji 1 Japanese names\n\nIn the Japanese language, a name is written with the family name first and the given name last. Kizu is the Wikipedian's family name, and Naoko is her given name, so in Japanese her name is \"Kizu Naoko\"\n\nIn English, most other European languages (Spanish, French, German, etc), and languages like Thai, Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, etc. the common practice is to reverse the name so that it fits western naming order, so the family name goes last and the given name goes first. I.E. \"Naoto Kan\" (Kan is family name) instead of \"Kan Naoto\" - This practice is done in those languages widely by the press, book publishers, governments, individuals, etc. in Japan and foreign countries.\n\nIn some other languages (Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Hungarian) the Japanese names of post Meiji 1 figures remain expressed in the Japanese order.\n\nThe MEXT (Japanese education ministry) published a survey asking Japanese people if they believe the practice of having the name switched, which originated in the Meiji era. There was no consensus in the survey results. See the end section of: http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/12/kokugo/toushin/001217d.htm (in Japanese - For an English summary, please see en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Japan#MEXT_document_on_Japanese_names)\n\nWhile widespread practice has the names of Japanese and Hungarian people switched to western order, typically Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese people do not have their names switched to western order.\n\nThe practice of name switching is commonplace, and most Japanese have not expressed opposition to it. However Aphaia has a strong preference for having her name written as \"Kizu Naoko\" even in foreign languages. She takes offense whenever a person expresses her name as \"Naoko Kizu\". Aphaia expressed a preference that her category, images portraying her, etc. should have the text read \"Kizu Naoko\" in Japanese order.\n\nHowever, manuals of styles of various Wikipedias ask that post-Meiji 1 Japanese names be put in western order if the Japanese person is of the modern day era (on the English Wikipedia, if the person is born on or after the first year of Meiji). On the English Wikipedia, editors do not allow specific pages to be expressed in Japanese order, even if the subject has commonly used or has a preference for Japanese order. On EN all post Meiji Japanese people are to have their names written in western order. (Pages on subjects born before Meiji 1, who are historical figures, use the Japanese naming order).\n\nEnglish Wikipedia: en:Wikipedia:MOS-JA#Names_of_modern_figures: \"For a modern figure—a person born after the beginning of the Meiji period (January 1, 1868 onward for our purposes)—always use the Western order of given name + family name for Western alphabet, and Japanese style family name+<space>+given name for Japanese characters.[...]\"\n\nFrench Wikipedia: fr:Wikipédia:Transcription_du_japonais#Noms_de_personnes: \"Les noms de personnes japonais sont toujours mentionnés sur Wikipédia dans l’ordre prénom, nom, contrairement à l’ordre traditionnel japonais (nom, prénom) :\" - It makes exceptions for historical figures and two modern day pen names (Oh! Great and Edogawa Rampo)\n\nSpanish Wikipedia: es:Wikipedia:Manual_de_estilo_para_artículos_de_origen_japonés#Nombres_de_personas: \"Para el título de figuras modernas, aún no existe un acuerdo en el orden del nombre, aunque se usa preferiblemente primero el nombre y luego el apellido.\" - Apparently the Spanish editors may not have technically reached an agreement yet on the naming order themselves, but established a preference for western order.\n\nGerman Wikipedia: de:Wikipedia:Namenskonventionen/Japanisch#Namensreihenfolge - Based on Google translate, generally people born after 1926 get western order, except for people who appear in German literature using the Japanese order - there may be something about personal preference being a factor, but I'm not sure... (modern sumo wrestling names are always in Japanese order on DE)\n\nRussian Wikipedia: ru:Википедия:Статьи_о_Японии#Имена персоналий - Because all names are \"Family Name, Given Name\" in article titles, Japanese names in article titles are \"Family Name, Given Name\" - But in the articles themselves, Japanese names are in western order ru:Исихара,_Синтаро\n\nI believe that despite preferences of particular individuals, the Commons, like the Wikipedias, should maintain/enact a manual of style governing all post-Meiji Japanese names so that they are expressed in the same naming order, but that would only affect Files, subject pages, and categories since those pages have \"official\" Commons content (analogous to Wikipedia articles. I would stress that Wikipedians, when on talk pages, category talk pages, user talk pages, user pages, etc. etc. should continue to refer to Aphaia as \"Kizu Naoko\" WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nA name is what people go by. If she wants Kizu Naoko, there's no harm in using that for her name everywhere. Otherwise I demand that Cherilyn Sarkisian be written that way everywhere.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nWell Cher was a stage name is \"Cher\" so the English Wikipedia uses that - Turns out she legally changed her entire name in 1978 to \"Cher\" (no family name, no middle name) - So that is her name, full stop.\n\nLikewise on EN if a Japanese person has a stage name/pen name \"Aba-kun\" the English article is \"Aba-kun\" but the article states the legal name is \"Taro Sato\" - That differs from the presentation of a Japanese name (what order is the actual name in). On EN and other Wikipedias pen names and stage names of post-Meiji 1 Japanese people go in Western order too (Yukio Mishima, legal name Kimitake Hiraoka).\n\nSpeaking of \"Cher\" we could very easily refer to the category and in many occasions author as simply \"Aphaia\" or \"Britty\" but there's still the question of how to refer to her legal name in \"official\" Commons material.\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nA photographer can be credited by any name they choose, regardless of Wikipedia article guidelines (besides which, this is Commons, not Wikipedia, and we don't operate under their guidelines). If Aphaia chooses to be credited as Kizu Naoko, you have no right to demand it be changed to something else, or to unilaterally change her uploads to something else. For any files you have already modified, I would strongly suggest you revert your changes. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nAphaia, is the subject of the photos in the category, not the photographer. The category and photos are at Category:Naoko Kizu\n\nWhile Commons is a separate project from the Wikipedias, it could easily establish its own manuals of style, and due to it's relationship with the Wikipedias, I think it would be a good idea.. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nSorry, misunderstood. Still, please respect her wishes. If she wishes to go by \"Kizu Naoko\", and she obviously does, please respect that wish. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nIf the Commons community has a consensus that certain individuals may have their names expressed in their preferred orders versus the standard order, then I would be happy to honor those wishes.\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nAs it stands, as far as I'm aware, there is no consensus either way, which means it defaults to the editor's choice in the matter, not the other way around. Look, I'm sure you mean well and are just trying to create a sense of standardisation, but I find it distasteful when the desire of an individual overwhelms the desires of other editors, and this situation seems to have that appearance. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nIn some cases Aphaia was the editor who added her own name in the photo descriptions, and in some cases she did not edit the descriptions at all.\n\nFor instance this photo used Western order from the start: File:Wikimania_2008_dungodung_64.jpg [6] (possibly because the Wikimania Alexandria name badge in the photo that she is wearing puts her name in Western order) - She did not edit the description in that photo (she probably didn't know the photo existed, since I added that photo to the category) - In photo descriptions which Aphaia edited, she used Japanese order - In some photos her legal name is not mentioned, and only her screenname is\n\nShe was the author of the Category:Kizu Naoko category - I moved that category the to western order to make everything consistent and added more photos to that category.\n\nSpeaking of the name badge, another factor that prompted me to use western order was that in some Wikimedia/Wikimania materials her name is written in Western order (the name badge, also the page title of http://wikimania2007.wikimedia.org/wiki/Presenters/Naoko_Kizu , although the text inside the page uses Japanese order)\n\nIn some other Wikimania materials I found the name was put in Japanese order: http://wikimania2008.wikimedia.org/wiki/Program_team and http://http://wikimania2008.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schedule (in schedule her name appears as \"KIZU Naoko\" while other Japanese/Japanese diaspora person's names are as \"Tomohiro Fukuhara, Yoshiaki Arai\")\n\nTo illustrate how the name is written in Japanese, I used the format that is seen in various European language Wikipedias on how Japanese names are displayed in Wikipedia articles and added \"Naoko Kizu (木津 尚子 Kizu Naoko) - aka Aphaia, Britty\" to the category description\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nPlease honor other user's wishes about how their names are used. I agree with Huntster - I see no ambiguity about this. --SJ+\n\nWe should always default to respecting the wishes of the subjects or creators of photos - where possible. It requires a very good reason to do otherwise, since it is simply inconsiderate. Simple pedantry is not a very good reason (even if it fuels Wikimedia :). --SJ+\n\nWell, I understand the sentiment. But I do not believe that this issue is pendantic. In my earlier years, I interacted with people who crafted the Manual of Style on Japanese names on EN. And discussions about which naming orders or better, or how to assign naming orders, came up constantly: en:Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles/Naming_order and en:Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(Japan-related_articles)/misc5#Name_Order_Discussion are some examples of discussion. It was very difficult to come up with the standards on how the names would be ordered, and who would get what order. Because of the level of controversy, I would think that such a thing isn't pedantic (at least by Wikimedia standards :) )\n\nIf this was a small, personal project with a group of close friends, or something about social networking, or something more informal, I would without hesitation have the name be written as \"Kizu Naoko\" - But Wikimedia Commons is a large educational project and I think conforming to general English/other language media print standards would be important. While I haven't found Aphaia's name in the news, if she suddenly had an article written about her in the NYT, or Agence Presse France, or the BBC, I would imagine that her name would appear in western order.\n\nLooking at the archives, I found a case where going against the subject's wishes on the name (in this case though, he's a public figure in the news constantly) may be editorially the best choice: en:Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(Japan-related_articles)/misc5#Name_Order_Discussion\n\n\"The naming of biographical articles in Wikipedia is complicated by the fact that one individual may be known under several different names at the same time, and may change their name a number of times in their life. For example, we have an article at Cat Stevens (his stage name) even though he was born as Stephen Demetre Georgiou and changed his name to Yusuf Islam. To be neutral, our only choice is to examine popular usage. —Morven 23:20, Jul 8, 2004 (UTC)\"\n\n\"Sometimes, I feel that those of us who live in Japan, or are just more familiar with Japanese culture than most of the English Wikipedia user profile, need to step back and realize that even though doing it this way is \"right\", when it has been established on WP to do it that way, it is for a very good reason. Most of the people reading about Japanese people in WP are not us, but others. I think the conventions are usually formed with that in mind, and thus, are what we should follow in the WP playground. Neier 08:02, 12 November 2005 (UTC)\"\n\nI am aware that the discussion is old, but I think the sentiment should illustrate how I feel about the issue.\n\nI think the determination for Commons on how to handle these issues ought to be not be necessarily what the subject of photograph wants. It is what is best for the reader or what the reader would expect. Commons is mainly for the user/reader. If the international media made a story about or featuring Aphaia, they would certainly use western order. I believe that acting in a manner that would help the reader in understanding the content would be a \"good reason\" for an exception to going by the wishes of the subject.\n\nIf the consensus is \"Well, Aphaia is not a public figure (yet?) and people who talk about her use FN-GN, so in this case it would be best for the reader to see her name in FN-GN and give an exception\" then I would be fine with that. I just hope that I illustrated why I take the position on the matter that I take.\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nWell, I just found something interesting: There's only one journalism-related article that I found about Aphaia so far, and it mentions Aphaia's name in Japanese order (not sure if the journalist knew whether \"Naoko\" was her first name or if he believed it was her family name.\n\nCohen, Noam. \"Some Errors Defy Fixes: A Typo in Wikipedia’s Logo Fractures the Sanskrit.\" The New York Times. June 25, 2007.\n\nI just sent an e-mail to Noam Cohen asking him if he knew that Aphaia's family name was \"Kizu.\"\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nAnyway, a recent trend is for Chinese people (at least) who have become famous in the last few decades to become known in English by the Asian name order: Yao Ming, Li Na, etc. AnonMoos (talk)\n\nYep - As the MEXT/Mombusho article points out, typically Korean and Chinese people do not have their names switched. And some Chinese people working abroad continue to be referred to in FN-GN order. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nI recently appealed to a flickr contributor to make one of their images available here.

For transparency and to prevent abuse, please add your username.\n\nRail tickets of the London Underground;Rail tickets of London Underground;r; grammar\n\nComment: I don't think grammar requires the the to be removed. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nIt is not correct, grammatically or otherwise, to use the article with \"London Underground\". As a , it does not require the article. Ravenseft (talk)\n\nUmmm, are you suggesting that it is always grammatically incorrect to use articles with proper nouns? If so, I think that is not right. It is grammatically correct to say \"I visited the White House today\", and incorrect to say *\"I visited White House today\". For that reason, there is nothing grammatically wrong with \"Rail tickets of the London Underground\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI'm sorry but your example is not helpful. The White House's official title is \"The White House\", like \"the United States\" and \"the British Virgin Islands\", so in these cases the \"the\" is indispensable. Hence, \"Mountains of the United States\" is correct and \"Mountains of United States\" is wrong. However, when \"the\" does not appear in the name, it is unnecessary to use it. So, \"Cars made by Toyota\" and not \"Cars made by the Toyota\". I realise this is not the place for an English lesson, that can be found elsewhere, so perhaps another native English speaker could confirm my explanation? Ravenseft (talk)\n\nI regard myself as a native speaker, and I have not heard of any rule which states that the is only to be used when the word is part of an \"official title\". (And how does one find out what the \"official title\" of a proper noun is? Why is the \"official title\" of the USA \"the United States of America\" and not simply \"United States of America\"?) The website you referred to is interesting, but it doesn't seem to lay down any hard and fast rule on the matter. For example, http://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-proper_3.htm states: \"We normally use 'the' with the following sorts of names: ... the Ritz Hotel, ... the Royal Theatre, ... the Crystal Palace\". I don't see how \"the London Underground\" is distinguishable from these examples. Anyway, I'm happy to hear views from other editors on this issue. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI'm copying this discussion to the Village Pump as this is probably not the best place for it. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThe answer to your question is quite simple - there is no \"the\" in London Underground. London Underground which issues the tickets in this category is a company founded in 1985, the full title of which is \"London Underground Limited\". I believe your confusion may have arisen from the fact that LU is sometimes used as a synonym for \"the Tube\" which refers to the network in general. The \"the\" is therefore superfluous at best and grammatically incorrect at worst; it also gives rise to the impression that more than one company is issuing Tube tickets. Ravenseft (talk)\n\nRavenseft, unfortunately in some respects you appear to have an unhelpfully oversimplified understanding of linguistic usage/grammar, and a simple Google search suggests that there are plenty of occurrences of the phrase \"the London Underground\" on UK sites: [9]... -- AnonMoos (talk)\n\nI don't see many other categories that includes a definite article. /Esquilo (talk)\n\nThere are a fair number that even begin with \"the\" -- see [10] -- and I imagine quite a bit more with \"the\" in the middle (e.g. Category:Flags of the United States etc. etc.). AnonMoos (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) A definite article isn't uncommon in category titles. See e.g. all the sub-categories of Category:People of New Zealand by region and all but one of the sub-categories of Category:French Revolution and of Category:Transport in the Dominican Republic. The exception in the latter case is Category:Buses in Dominican Republic, which seems just as unnatural to me as Category:Rail tickets of London Underground. (I'm not saying that \"London Underground\" always requires an article; there wouldn't be anything grammatically wrong with Category:London Underground rail tickets, for instance.) This nomination seems to be based on a very peculiar idea of English grammar. --Avenue (talk)\n\nMost of the categories AnonMoos links to seems to be books, films etc where 'the' is a part of thier name. There is a definite distinction between Category:The Black Cat and Category:Black cats. /Esquilo (talk)\n\nPoint of order -- Ravenseft wrote “The White House's official title is ‘The White House’...” ‘The White House’ is a nickname. The official title of the POTUS`s residence is something like “the Executive Mansion”. Geo Swan (talk)\n\nIt is very common in English to use the definite article before proper nouns that are of the form \"Adjective Noun\", even if the noun doesn't strictly include the article, except when the noun is used as an adjective. (As noted above: \"I went to the White House\", but \"White House security is tight\".) \"London Underground\" fits this pattern; it sounds stilted (at least to American ears) to omit the definite article. Exceptions include the titles of creative works (e.g., Dangerous Liasons or Scary Movie), though such works often incorporate the definite article anyway (e.g., The Little Mermaid). Powers (talk)\n\n\"London Underground\" is a en:Proper noun. The definite article should be excluded. Rd232 (talk)\n\nOr, to be more precise, it's a proper noun referring to the company existing since 1985 (en:London Underground) and by extension the institution existing since 1933. Rd232 (talk)\n\nWhile proper nouns are not normally preceded by an article (e.g. Chicago, Lady Gaga, etc.), they often are (the New York Times, the CN Tower, etc.). Whether it is a proper noun or not is a red herring. What is the most common usage, with or without an article? What does en-wp use? --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nThe company/institution name does not include the definite article. On the other hand, when referring to the system, especially prior to 1933, the definite article is used, because then it's a common name (adjective+noun). Rd232 (talk)\n\nIf including the article is only considered to be a solecism by a few railgeeks and company employees, but hundreds of thousands of ordinary riders are perfectly happy to include it, then I see no reason to change the category names. Meanwhile, the article en:London_Underground includes the article several times in the introductory section alone... AnonMoos (talk)\n\nOrdinary riders call it \"the tube\". Rd232 (talk)\n\nReally? I call it \"the Underground\". That phrase is used in 'Art on the Underground' and 'Poems on the Underground', so I'm not the only one. But the whole conversation is slightly silly anyway. Is this amount of discussion worth it just to decide on whether to include 'the' or not? Carcharoth (Commons) (talk)\n\nWell, this is potentially an issue that affects thousands of categories. I don't know if any definite rules concerning the use (or non-use) of the in front of proper nouns can be identified – if someone can help in this regard, please do. However, based on the discussion so far it looks like there is no single right answer, which means that each disputed renaming request will have to be separately discussed in the hope that consensus can be reached. We should strive, though, for consistency within each branch of the category tree, at least (in other words, we should not have \"Category:Rail tickets of the London Underground\" coexisting with \"Category:Escalators of London Underground\").\n\nIt has also occurred to me that a distinction should be made between companies and places. It may be appropriate to leave out the definite article when referring to a company (\"I work for London Underground [Limited]\") but less so when referring to a place (\"The London Underground [system] transports thousands of people each hour\"). — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nYes, that distinction is important, and may explain some of the disagreement here. There would be nothing grammatically wrong with \"Category:Rail tickets issued by London Underground Limited\". I still think \"Category:Rail tickets of London Underground\" is incorrect, though (because the dominant meaning of \"London Underground\" is the railway network, not the company). --Avenue (talk)\n\nThis type of train was never owned by the SNCF but the RATP. See french wikipedia. Please rename. Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nPlease leave a request at \"User talk:CommonsDelinker/commands\".

For the others it's the same, so there's no harm and all gain. -- Darwin Ahoy!\n\nNevertheless the category should be deleted. 1) it is sorted wrong into Category:Creative Commons licenses which is a section of our free licenses copyright statuses, but this is not a free copyright status. 2) the alternative category of Category:Copyright statuses - unfree copyright statuses - is expected to contain no content other then the only allowed unfree Wikimedia content. Axpde can add this tag to his files but he can not create a license category, the scope of Commons is not to offere images under various unfree copyright status but under free licenses, therefore this category is unecessary and only confusing. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nWhy not create a subcategory \"non-free Creative Commons licenses\" to clearly differentiate? Effeietsanders (talk)\n\nThe category is useless on itself, but when crossed with GFDL may be of some use, still. But in any case it shouldn't be categorized under the free licenses or mixed with them in some other way, of course.-- Darwin Ahoy!\n\n@Effeietsanders: Scope of this project. Creates the wrong impression that Commons accepts content under free licenses as well as unfree licenses, or that Commons is a source for free as well as unfree content. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nSince double licenses are allowed, CC-NC is of course \"allowed\" insofar. I think that the reasoning that sometimes CCBYNC is preferrable over GFDL makes sense. In that case, categorizing the NC also makes sense, as long as it is clearly seperated from the free licenses so that people don't get confused. I merely suggested a method for accomplishing that goal (since it /is/ a Creative Commons license, removing it totally from that category doesn't make sense to me) - if you know a better method, that could of course be considered just as well. I do not see where the scope of the project has any influence whatsoever on how we arrange our categories. Effeietsanders (talk)\n\nI just looked at Category:Creative Commons licenses, it doesn't read \"media files published under free Creative Commons licenses\" but simply \"media files published under Creative Commons licenses\". And my pictures have CC license, so what's the problem? I added a warning to the category in case someone wants to use just this licens"
