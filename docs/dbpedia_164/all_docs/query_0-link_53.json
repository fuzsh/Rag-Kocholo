This is fine for some users and web-browsers but certainly not all. This seems to be a non-universal technical tweak - perhaps in an effort to discourage vanity - that appears in some high-profile infoboxes, like Template:Infobox Actor. Many people and groups have more than one official site further compounding the issue, and yes, they may have three or more official websites. Since the infobox is part of the lede and highly visible I propose that use of forcing \"Official website\" be deprecated and offered as an alternative only if needed for extra long website formatting issues. The number of article subjects with official websites is only growing; surely we don't want them all to simply read \"official website\" which only confirms that a website exists? This is also likely an accessibility issue as I believe some users simply print out articles or otherwise can't easily confirm what is hidden below a link. Many users also pay for each second they are online so having to find ways to see information we are hiding also seems unhelpful.\n\nI don't think we should tease readers. With the rare exception of web addresses that are too long there is no reason to do this. Which is more helpful?\n\nOfficial Website\n\nEn.Wikipedia.org\n\nI think it's clear that we need to share information rather than tease its existence.\n\nhttp://www.example.org/ should be displayed as Example.org, multiple websites that are official are fine. The only reasons to limit websites, that come to mind, is 1. extra lengthy websites that cause formatting problems forcing an inforbox to grow into the text needlessly and 2. more than a handful of websites that seem unhelpful to list all in an infobox. In this case editors should strive toward consensus to find a workable solution, possibly employing the external links section to display the full list. The other suggestion regarding this is this, is that websites be formatted for clarity - jimbosmajicsite.edu should be displayed as JimbosMajicSite.edu so it is more readily apparent that users are directed to the right website. -- Banjeboi\n\nWhat exactly is the problem here? In {{Infobox Actor}} the parameter should be used only for an official website, so the \"Official website\" description should be applicable in all cases. PC78 (talk)\n\nSorry if I didn't explain this well. Currently some infoboxes have technically forced the parameter to read\n\nOfficial Website, instead of\n\nEn.Wikipedia.org.\n\nThere is a messy workaround to get the website displayed but \"Official Website\" is still forced in as well. It simply isn't needed and surely hundreds of infoboxes stating \"Official Website\" instead of the actual website isn't benefiting the reader's understanding by teasing that there is an \"Official Website\" but making them take extra steps to confirm the actual address. -- Banjeboi\n\nI think Benjiboi's proposal makes sense. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI've had to workaround that on a few infoboxes, myself. \"Official Website\" should not be displayed if there is more than one \"official website\". — Arthur Rubin (talk)\n\nI still don't see the problem here. What is wrong with having an infobox formatting links to read \"Official website\"? This is consistant with other external links templates. If the website is official, then how is saying \"Official website\" in any way misleading? Why does the actual website address need to be displayed? PC78 (talk)\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think \"Official Website\" should be displayed instead of the actual web address at all, with the main exception being that the web address is so long it expands the infobox too much. Some government websites, for instance, are extremely long. PC78, people look to Wikipedia for a variety of reasons, including verifying which website(s) is actually the correct one for an artist or company. Many Internet users are at less sophisticated technical levels and abilities. If someone goes to look at Pop Star Foo's article there's simply no good reason the infobox can't openly share what Pop Star Foo's website is instead of stating \"Official website\" which only convey's that one exists. There's no need to mask or hide this information just like we frown on wikilink surprises, we should be clear and upfront with information. -- Banjeboi\n\nAgain, I don't see a problem, so I guess I will have to disagree with you on this. When a reader clicks on a link that says \"Official website\" there should be no surprises unless they are taken to a website that isn't official, in which case the infobox parameter has been misused. I do not think that we are \"masking\" information here. Presumably you have a similar problem with the use of {{official}}? PC78 (talk)\n\nJust to follow up on what you said at Template talk:Infobox Actor, I guess I don't see the inherant value in displaying a full URL, but I'm willing to concede that point if others do. However, I don't see a problem with formatting the link in an infobox, where space is often limited. Perhaps it would be better to insist that the full url is displayed in the \"External links\" section of an article instead? PC78 (talk)\n\nFor clarity on this, can you explain more fully why\n\nOfficial Website is better than\n\nEn.Wikipedia.org?\n\nI see no net gain by concealing the web address when it's agreed this is indeed the official website. -- Banjeboi\n\nBecause the template provides a consistant format that applies to all such links. It eliminates the need for users to manually format the link, which in practise is likely to be highly inconsistant. Even URLs of moderate length can strech an infobox. As I said above, I would not oppose displaying a full URL in the appropriate section of an article (\"External links\") if it is felt that this is a worthwhile piece of information in itself. Can you clarify your own position? How does your second example make the link more accessable to someone who will most likely just want to click it? PC78 (talk)\n\n(outdent) I spot-checked a handful of infoboxes, and found no real consistency. Some displayed URL, some used an \"Official website\" or similar named link. Even passing the website= parameter varies (sometimes full URL, sometimes just the site without \"http://\"). Each \"makes sense\", each is confusing to editors and each encourages different hacks to make the layout look \"the other way\" from how it is. Many that display full URL prefix it with a text string like \"homepage:\" (either as title in first column with URL in second, which makes even less space for long URL) or in a line above, which makes it harder to relate that title to the URL visually).\n\nMy major problem with the \"concealed\" approach is that I think the URL itself is part of the encyclopediac information. That is, it's more than just a case where one might want \"some place to click to learn about something\" (i.e., citation for a fact, cross-ref for a word, or external additional information source). We kinda expect that entities have websites, so saying \"here is the link to the website\" is a navigational aid but doesn't add as much information as seeing the URL does. A reader might want the URL itself for his own linking purposes rather than just being able to go there and read. The formatting issue is important (long URL widens the box), but doesn't make the page totally unusable, and WP has long appeared to lean towards content and accessibility (another argument made above) at the expense of perfect layout. I'm still using FFox2, which I know does a poor job of \"intelligent\" line-breaking by modern standards. Are FFox3 or others automatically able (or can be taught via div styles?) to break \"too long for space\" lines at slashes or somehow else have some optional-break (but not \"insert hyphen if break\") invisible chars? another option is to make the long-side side-scrollable. We use this solution in the chemistry infoboxes, where we have very long chemical names and other data-strings. A final option is to hide the URL behind \"Official website\" named link, but also have the URL itself visible in a collapsed-by-default frame there. That would avoid breaking layout but also have the URL plainly accessible for whatever purpose. DMacks (talk)\n\nExactly, this will hopefully strive for transparency and consistency. We can't presume someone wants to click through, although they may, anymore than we presume they read any of the other infomation or click any wikilinks. The benefit of\n\nEn.Wikipedia.org\n\nis that you don't have to do anything to know what the web address is. No clicking, scrolling, or any other steps to see this is the web address. I am also opposed to a click to see option as that's also hiding this information. The side-scrolling solution for very long addresses may make sense although I'm not a specialist in accessibility issues. -- Banjeboi\n\nI'm still not seeing a need to display such information in the infobox. Have it at the foot of an article by all means, but in the infobox it's superfluous. We're hardly \"concealing information\" here. Autoformatting the link works for the reasons I gave above, plus it prevents (in theory) misuse of the parameter by those who would add links to fan sites, blogs, IMDb links, or other such nonsense. Even at best I don't think it's something that needs an MOS ruling; better to determine how appropriate this is on a case by case basis. PC78 (talk)\n\nWell, vandalism happens regardless and fansites will be injected and reverted no matter what we do. Just like someone can sneak a false weblink ina reference they can do so almost everywhere. By the logic that it doesn't need to be in the infobox then your position is that no website should be displayed at all and instead in the external links? Seems also like a foolish idea, this is, after all, a web-based encyclopedia. It is through the use of web addresses that people get to us. Just as we feel a company's name and city, and industry etc is important so is their website. Just as almost every musician advertises their website prominently on ... everything. It is a chief part of their branding identity. This certainly seems to be key information and is only growing in usage. If, on specific articles editors decree that no website should be linked in the infobox that may make sense - not sure, personally - but some editors have forced the use of \"official website\" in templates that are highly visible so this is certainly a MOS issue. Someone else can cite how many articles we have this on. And i can assure you there is already edit-warring going on over this so case-by-case will only be a prolonged, community-draining, process that won't really do anything different than the mess we currently have. -- Banjeboi\n\nWell no, clearly you've missed my point entirely, and I still don't see why you have a problem with using \"Official website\" for official websites. Vandalism may happen regardless, but that doesn't mean we should discourage it. Messy workarounds like the one you've employed in John Inman should not be used; they aren't needed, and you certainly shouldn't be edit waring to force them in. If you think we need to display a full url in an infobox merely to promote the \"branding identity\" of celebrities, then frankly your reasoning is way off. PC78 (talk)\n\nWell, I don't see your point. I see no reason to see\n\n[http://En.Wikipedia.com Official Website]\n\nover\n\nOfficial website: http://En.Wikipedia.com\n\nThe latter seems quite clear. — Arthur Rubin (talk)\n\nThe latter may stretch some infoboxes; longer URLs certainly will. With regards to printing pages, it simply won't be an issue if the full URL is displayed at the foot of an article. PC78 (talk)\n\nI favour exposing URLs (or at least domain names). Consider people who print pages for later reference. An additional benefit of using that method is that we can apply markup (e.g. <span class=\"url\">http://En.Wikipedia.com</span>) to the URL, in infoboxes which emit an hCard microformat, thereby including the URL in the emitted metadata. Andy Mabbett (User:Pigsonthewing); Andy's talk; Andy's edits\n\nI too support making it visible for the reason Pigsonthewing cites - if someone prints out the article, the official website URL should be visible. I've recently made this comment at Template_talk:Infobox_Writer#Display_url_of_website.3F, though there's been no reply yet. PamD (talk)\n\nI started the following discussion at Template talk:Article issues#Saying issues when we mean problems. In my opinion, participation by the style experts here would contribute to the quality of discussion over there. Finell (talk)\n\nSaying issues when we mean problems\n\nI know this was discussed very briefly several months ago, but I propose, for discussion, changing the word issues to problems in this template. This usage of issues began in the software industry as a euphemism for bugs, which itself was a euphemism for defects. Regrettably, this new usage has spread, virus-like, into the real world, as in, \"Jane obtained a restraining order because Dick has issues\". In my opinion, this usage has no place in formal writing. It is a misuse of a word that has a different, well settled meaning in place of another word that means what the writer intends. In the case of Wikipedia:\n\nThe undecided question of whether something in an article should be changed is an issue to raise on the article's talk page.\n\nThis template, on the other hand, is a pronouncement that an article has problems that should be fixed.\n\nI invite the opinions of other editors. Finell (Talk) 02:00, 11 February 2009 (UTC)\n\nI moved thatgamecompany to ThatGameCompany per MOSTM guidelines on but it was recently changed to Thatgamecompany by another editor. I have stated on the article's talk page that I believe it should be ThatGameCompany (CamelCase) because it makes the trademark easier to read and indicates how the word should be read. Before I change it back, I wanted to get a second opinion? Is Thatgamecompany correct or should it be changed back to ThatGameCompany? Thanks. ChimpanzeeUK - User | Talk | Contribs\n\nAnswered on article talk page. Thanks. ChimpanzeeUK - User | Talk | Contribs\n\nI couldn't find anything about this, but I'm not sure if I tried searched hard enough...is there anything regarding how to type single letters? For example should it be: \"the letter \"o\" is...\" or \"the letter o is...\" or some other way? That's my two scents\n\nSee Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Italics (subsection \"Words as words\").\n\n-- Wavelength (talk)\n\n[I corrected section to subsection. -- Wavelength (talk) ]\n\n\"A transgender, transsexual or genderqueer person's latest preference of name and pronoun should be adopted when referring to any phase of that person's life\" - MOS:IDENTITY\n\nThis part sounds troubling to me because it lets a person's whim rule the language; isn't there a more objective standard that WP could use? For example: has penis, is man, has vagina, is woman (sorry if I sounded like Captain Obvious now). -- Stormwatch (talk)\n\nNo, for several reasons, one of them being the lack of reliable sources for the presence or absence of this or that sexual organ for most living people, porn performers accounting for most of the exceptions. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nEnglish usage would be a possible objective standard; it would normally agree with the above, and would also cover cases it does not - such as the Chevalier d'Eon. The present rule also fails its own objective of permitting self-identification to reign; the choice of saying \"I was male; I am female\" is arbitrarily excluded. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nHoary, in the age of Photoshop, I think your point about pornstars is highly suspicious. Tony (talk)\n\nA person's self perception of his or her gender should normally be used as the gender to use when talking about this person. In most cases there is a (court-) decision based on a legal process whether a person is to be considered male or female. WP must respect these official rulings, regardless of the absence or presence of generally defining criteria (genitalia). If there has no legal process occurred, the self perception should be used, because the gender role cannot be defined based on external characteristics. In most cases this is not a whim. --Goodgirl - talk to me\n\nWhy? We don't respect most official rulings, although we mention them; often it's a POV question whether an official ruling is correct (for example, the contending official rulings of the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or the numerous official decisions of the People's Republic of China on Falun Gong; if we respected the last, the Great Firewall might come down). Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nWe disrespect rulings in controversies, which I support to keeping the NPOV. Rulings regarding the legal gender status of a person are made according the persons self perception and unanimously -- in most cases. So I feel your objection misses the topic. --Goodgirl - talk to me\n\nI know a number of people who prefer to be addressed by Spivak pronouns as a way of protesting the gender binary, and at least one person who like to be addressed as \"it.\" I object to the suggestion that transsexuals are of \"ambiguous\" gender; they are of their chosen gender, whether or not they have had the operation. Any other attitude would generally be offensive to them. Some genderqueer people are fine with having either pronoun applied to them - in that case I'd say it's up to editor discretion and consistency is what's important. Dcoetzee\n\nI have started an RfC regarding adopting a policy on the definition and use of ambiguous terms.\n\nAny comments are extremely welcome.--FimusTauri (talk)\n\nThis is about the use of the word \"myth\", and possibly other words used in articles about religion. My preference would be that we not try to nail down the NPOV content of problematic words in the style guidelines; however, I lost that battle over at WT:AVOID. - Dan Dank55 (push to talk)\n\nThe above comment is in error. Whilst I am also arguing about the use of \"myth\" in the context of religious articles, it was during research for that discussion that I realised there is a significant gap in overall policy on the use of ambiguous words. Quite significantly, the proposal actually allows for the use of the word \"myth\" in any article. All the proposal asks is that, where a word has any ambiguity, then the context in which the word is used provides clarity. This proposal is about the use of language in general. The discussion about \"myth\" is an issue of NPOV and quite seperate.--FimusTauri (talk)\n\nIn the use of adjective meaning \"of the Xth century\", in one section (Wikipedia:MOS#Longer_periods) the en dash is used, while in another (Wikipedia:MOS#Numbers_as_figures_or_words) the hyphen is used. From the punctuation section I understand that the hyphen is probably the right one, but I would like a confirmation.Baltaci (talk) —Preceding undated comment was added on .\n\nI don't see any inappropriate en dashes in adjectives (only in ranges, as in 1991–1997, where it's correct). Can you point out exactly where you found one?--Kotniski (talk)\n\nSee a 19th-century book (en dash) vs 19th‑century painting (hyphen). (use the find function of your browser)Baltaci (talk)\n\nA hyphen should definitely be used in the above examples. I have to say they both look like hyphens to me. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nTo me too. If you're seeing any as something other than ordinary hyphens, please correct them. --Kotniski (talk)\n\nI was wrong after all. Actually they're both hyphens, just the second is a non-breaking hyphen(U+2011), while the first is a regular one(U+2010). They look different on my system (the regular one is somewhat longer), so I thought the first was a dash. I have no idea which one to choose, so I won't modify it.Baltaci (talk)\n\nQuality of Wikipedia is pretty poor since it requires every little trivial bit sourced, and doesn't allow generalizations on most subjects, this makes it a tedious read on most subjects[citation needed]. Why the images are not required to be sourced, also? It is very easy to mislead a non-native, or a slow reader, with these. 80.186.223.203 (talk)\n\nYou probably want to bring this up at WP:Verifiability.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nIs there any way that a printer-friendly version of MoS could be produced? maybe in pdf or even just rtf. I imagine a suitably enthusiastic editor could create one manually, but I was wondering if one could be generated automatically. I am assuming there isn't one at the moment - if there is, could a link to it be added.--FimusTauri (talk)\n\nHow would it be different from the page got using the \"Printable version\" link at the left of the page? [1] Shreevatsa (talk)\n\nMainly because there are so many different pages that comprise the MoS, not just a single web page. I suppose I should have specified a 'collated' printer-friendly version. Besides which, \"printable\" is very different to \"printer-friendly\". --FimusTauri (talk)\n\nProbably wouldn't be a great idea. Whether or not a page has \"manual of style\" in its title is no great guide to its contents. Different people have different ideas as to what kind of guidance constitutes \"style\" guidance. Much style stuff is on non-MoS pages; and much non-style stuff is on MoS pages (depending on your definition). <standard moan> It would be nice to sort this out, but making even minor changes to the names and structure of guideline pages always requires a massive argument with people who think it spells the end of Wikipedia as they know it... </standard moan> --Kotniski (talk)\n\nWhich dashes are used for tennis scores? (\"3-6, 6-2, 6-2\", etc.) I was looking at Anna Kournikova and it seems to use em dashes, which look too long to me: I would have thought the right character was an en dash, or even a hyphen. Shreevatsa (talk)\n\nYou should use an en-dash: see \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style#En dashes\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThanks, I fixed that article. Someone should probably look at other Tennis articles and make similar fixes, with a bot or something... Shreevatsa (talk)\n\nTwo problems:\n\n1. How can I locate images to the right when there is already a right-floating box (a chronology)? I have used a table kludge at the top of Dura-Europos. I hope there's a better more consistent way. There are a few other images that I have moved left because of the chronology, but would like on the right and if there is a better way I'd happily use it. Using a table will make editing difficult.\n\n2. How would I get a table which was a border like class=\"wikitable\", but which allows me to use cellpadding. When I tried cellpadding to give text a bit of air in a wikitable, it didn't work. So, how would I get both cellpadding and a fine border?\n\nThanks for any pointers. -- spincontrol\n\nI suspect there are no satisfactory answers (they sound like problems I've had in the past and failed to solve), but the right place to ask is probably Help talk:Table.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nThanks for the tip. I'll give it a try. -- spincontrol\n\nFollowing copied from Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions\n\nHi I asked this at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (capitalization) but got no replies so I'm trying here:\n\n[2] seems to suggest it is a subordinating conjunction, rather than a coordinating conjunction; is this distinction significant? Other subordinating conjunctions with fewer than five letters are:\n\nif\n\nthat\n\ntill\n\nwhat\n\nwhen\n\nas if\n\nas long as\n\neven if\n\nso that\n\n(each word of the compounds has fewer than five letters)\n\nCurrent usage on Wikipedia is mixed, although lowercase seems to dominate to me (no absolute figures to prove this) e.g.:\n\nAs Slow As Possible\n\nVictoria Wood As Seen On TV (but on certainly should not be capitalised)\n\nDry As a Bone (note a is not capitalised, which is correct)\n\nvs.\n\nVenus as a Boy\n\nJustice as Fairness\n\nLife as a House\n\nThick as a Brick\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nI Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\n\nIt seems to me that strictly conforming to the letter of the manual means as should be capitalised, but is that how it is actually applied, both on the Wiki and elsewhere?\n\nAny guidance gratefully received. --Rogerb67 (talk)\n\nIt seems there isn't any clear rule one way or the other. Try asking at WT:MOS - people there tend to know these things.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nend of section copied from Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions\n\nAsking here as suggested. Thanks in advance for your advice. --Rogerb67 (talk)\n\nThe last two examples, from Joyce and Wordsworth, are certainly usage; since as here has much the same function as a preposition, it is sensible to treat them the same way. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nThe distinction between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions is significant, but is not relevant to any of your examples, because \"as\" is not a conjunction in them. An example of \"as\" used as a conjunction is: I must be leaving soon as I have to get up early tomorrow. A title would rarely have a subordinating conjunction in it, because the latter joins two clauses, and most titles don't contain full clauses. (The exception here is I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud, but \"as\" is not a conjunction here.) But what you really want to know is whether \"as\" should be capitalized. I'm afraid I don't know a solid general rule to answer that question, but if your examples are, in fact, titles (I know that at least some of them are), you should copy whatever capitalization the original work uses. --Unconventional (talk)\n\nThanks, that was helpful. What parts of speech are they in my examples? Could you point me to the policy that supports \"you should copy whatever capitalization the original work uses\"? What I see is WP:CAPS \"In general, each word in titles of books, films, and other works takes an initial capital, except for articles (\"a\", \"an\", \"the\"), the word \"to\" as part of an infinitive, prepositions and coordinating conjunctions shorter than five letters (e.g., \"on\", \"from\", \"and\", \"with\"), unless they begin or end a title or subtitle.\" This doesn't mention the original capitalisation at all. The policy article also mentions several examples of titles, which would be rather strange if this were true. --Rogerb67 (talk)\n\nI noticed that many of the Spanish language titles are incorrect in English Wikipedia. According to the Royal Spanish Academy Official Orthography, only the first word of any artistic work goes with initial upper case, every other word should be written with lower case, except, of course, the proper names within the title. So, titling like \"Entre El Mar Y Una Estrella\" (which may be correct in English), is wrong in Spanish. The correct form is: \"Entre el mar y una estrella\". This is valid for all titles, also for two-word-titles as \"Piel morena\", \"Ten paciencia\", \"Tú y yo\".\n\nFor reference, see \"mayúsculas\" in Royal Spanish Academy's Panhispanic Dictionary of Doubts:\n\n\"[Se escriben con inicial mayúscula las palabras siguientes:]\n\n4.17. La primera palabra del título de cualquier obra de creación (libros, películas, cuadros, esculturas, piezas musicales, programas de radio o televisión, etc.); el resto de las palabras que lo componen, salvo que se trate de nombres propios, deben escribirse con minúscula: Últimas tardes con Teresa, La vida es sueño, La lección de anatomía, El galo moribundo, Las cuatro estaciones, Las mañanas de la radio, Informe semanal. En el caso de los títulos abreviados con que se conocen comúnmente determinados textos literarios, el artículo que los acompaña debe escribirse con minúscula: el Quijote, el Lazarillo, la Celestina.\"\n\nSo, I suggest a revision for all Spanish language titles and their correction or rename according to this. I know that unfortunately the same artists are not aware of the official rules and write the titles of their works as they want, but I think in an encyclopedia we must keep the Royal Spanish Academy's official spelling rules.\n\nRegards, --El Mexicano (talk)\n\nI think we should use whatever reliable English language sources use, and not base our rules based on a foreign language rule book, unless the English language sources are not clear on the issue, in which case more weight can be given to a foreign language rule. --PBS (talk)\n\nThe RAE rules are clear and sensible, and avoid any arguments about what is a \"reliable English language source\". Physchim62 (talk)\n\nSorry, but I think that if a title is in a foreign language, you must write it according to the rules of that language, and neither any English nor any Wikipedia rules should overwrite an official spelling rule for a foreign language. So I must agree with Physchim62. Of course, languages that do not use the Latin alphabet, are an exceptional case, where conventional English transcription rules will be valid. But Spanish is not that case. --El Mexicano (talk)\n\nChicago agrees with you in most cases, but because they're looking for a simple rule that works in a lot of cases, not because a Spanish authority says so (specifically, although that probably was taken into account): 10.3, Capitalization of foreign titles: For foreign titles of works, whether these appear in text, notes, or bibliographies, Chicago recommends a simple rule: capitalize only the words that would be capitalized in normal prose. But AP Stylebook at composition titles says: Translate a foreign title into English unless the work is known to the American public by its foreign name ... \"The Magic Flute\", \"Die Walkuere\". Note that \"Die Walkuere\" is what a German would write only if they're writing very informally or for an English audience; almost all the time, Germans write \"Die Walküre\", but AP Stylebook in general recommends American English orthography. - Dan Dank55 (push to talk)\n\nwhen El Mexicano wrote \"Of course, languages that do not use the Latin alphabet are an exceptional case\", i suppose he/she meant \"languages whose alphabets have no upper- and lower-case differentiation\", which is not the same thing. Cyrillic has upper- and lower-case letters. Sssoul (talk)\n\nOf course. I meant a language like Arabic or Chinese. Also note that this rules in Spanish is very new: the academic Ortografía of 1999 still allowed that in \"composition works\" like series, albums, etc. the nouns and adjectives go with Upper case (but never the conjunctions and prepositions, that was always wrong); but Diccionario panhispánico de dudas (\"Pan-Hispanic Dictionary of Doubts\") of 2005, instead, says categorically that in every title of creation work should only the first word be written with upper case (except for the proper names in the title, of course). --El Mexicano (talk)\n\nThe Opera project always use the native style for foreign titles guideline here, but the Visual arts project usually uses whatever art historians writing in English predominantly use (often the same, but not always) guideline here. Either approach seems fine to me, but it is helpful if there is a guideline by subject area saying which is preferred. I think this question is best decided at project or article level, & anything here should be left flexible, after explaining that there is an issue. Johnbod (talk)\n\nWell, it was the Music Project Wikipedia page where I first added this note, but there were no answers and no reactions. I've done it also twice. Then I wrote a message to User:Efe as I noticed he is the most involved in the project, and he told me to come here, because the experts were here. :) --El Mexicano (talk)\n\nIf this is new and catches on throughout Spanish America, doubtless English will follow in time. We can move all these articles when that happens and not before; spelling reformers have been known to change their minds.\n\nThere is no particular reason to change old titles even then, unless it becomes customary to do so; that has a certain silliness, like revising the established English form of Don Quixote away from Cervantes' own form. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nI think that transparent layers should not be used in wikipedia images as this mixes the content of an image with the colour of the web page. I browse the web with the browser and operating system set to white text on a black background, and this means that many images with transparent layers are unviewable. Also the keys to maps becomes invisible. Images would be accessible if they use the full colours that the images are supposed to represent instead of using transparent layers which rely on the web page background colour.\n\nFor discussion of this see: Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#Transparent backgrounds in images. Charvest (talk)\n\nA difference of opinion about editing a quote has come up. The quote is:\n\n\"Achtung! Achtung! Achtung! The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area.\"\n\nIt is a quote from British historian Frederick Taylor (in Dresden: Tuesday 13 February 1945. London: Bloomsbury, 2005, ISBN 0-7475-7084-1. page 280.) Taylor being British will assume that his readers will understand the word Achtung means, should such a word in a quote be translated by a Wikipedia editor eg:\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Attention! The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area.\"\n\nor should the words be left as they are on the assumption they are inside a quote from an English language source that is written for a general reading public and not specialist audience, or should a footnote be provided with a translation.\n\nCurrently AFAICT the Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Quotations does not give explicit guidance on the issue of foreign words embedded in English language quotes. As foreign words are not in the exceptions section of the section on quotes one could assume they should not be translated, but perhaps this needs to addressed should it be? --PBS (talk)\n\nDirect quotes really shouldn't be tampered with. If a translation is required, then a footnote should be sufficient. PC78 (talk)\n\nTaylor's assumption that all Brits would know what \"Achtung\" means doesn't hold for American readers. I would be greatly surprised if even 1 in 4 recognized it as anything other than a reference to a U2 album. He obviously translated \"The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area\" rather than quote it verbatim; the same should hold for the word he chose not to translate because he thought all English speakers would know what it meant. arimareiji (talk)\n\nPC78 is right. The words in a quotation should not be altered. If a translation is needed, this should be put into a footnote. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nExactly. If you're going to quote rather than paraphrase or summarize, the words within the quote marks must not be substantively altered from how they appear in the source being quoted.—DCGeist (talk)\n\nSo what if the phrase in quote marks is itself a translation of the original, non-English, wording? Where multiple possible translations could be made, how is an authoritative version to be arrived at? Kevin McE (talk)\n\nThat doesn't matter. If you are quoting from a particular published English translation, then you shouldn't alter any of the words in that quotation. If you are quoting from the original in, say, German, I would suggest setting out the original German text and providing a translation in English. See, for instance, \"Bucentaur#The 1727 bucentaur\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nwikt:Achtung. Wikilink to Wiktionary for foreign terms (the English edition usually has definitions for foreign terms). Keeps the original quote intact (which is much more important than the reader's confusion), but also provides a definition for users. Problem solved. EVula // talk // ☯ //\n\nGreat.

On Wikipedia, should the (Party-State) parenthetical ever be used? If so, in what way? D-NV, D-Nevada, Democrat-Nevada, etc? Copysan (talk)\n\nI'd suggest the more transparent \"Nevada Senator John Doe\" or \"Senator John Doe of Nevada.\" It's brief enough and not nearly as cryptic. Dcoetzee\n\nBut with care. \"Nevada Senator John Doe\" is more likely to mean, and \"Senator John Doe of Nevada\" can mean, a member of the Nevada State Senate, not a Senator of the United States. Probably (Democratic-Nevada) once in the article, and then (D-NV) for all senators (possibly spelling out Republican for R once too). Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nI'd just point out again that we do not use prenominal titles. Preferred would be John Doe, Democratic senator from Nevada (note the lowercase s in senator). --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWe don't? I get 37 hits on \"Senator Henry Clay\", which is idiomatic in my native tongue; I don't know about Trovatore's. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nCertainly it's idiomatic. So is Mr. Henry Clay or Dr. Henry Clay; we don't use those either. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nIf an article has strong national ties to a country, which does not use English as it's primary language, but which does favor a certain variety in its English language media, should Strong national ties to a topic be used in favor of Retaining the existing variety? It not with the present wording, should the wording be changed? (This has been suggested in this discussion.) -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nThe only reason I can see for having this only apply to primarily English-speaking countries is that in other cases there may be no spelling tradition apparent. But in cases where a clear leaning can be determined, I don't see any reason not to. Equazcion •✗/C • 05:42, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nWell, it depends on what sort of country you mean, I think. If we're talking about a country that, while English is not its official or primary language, nevertheless has a distinctive variety of its own, then sure (India is the obvious example).\n\nBut if you're talking about the tendency of Continental European sources to favor British English, then absolutely not. There is no distinctive English variety from Continental Europe. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWell it would be a decision based on individual country, not continent, and many countries do have a distinct variety. Equazcion •✗/C • 05:47, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nAnd I would say you should use whatever most of the readers of that country are used to seeing: what the English media of that country uses, etc. Shreevatsa (talk)\n\nNo, I think that's absolutely wrong. If the population mostly doesn't read English, then what's in those few publications that do use it is irrelevant. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nA lengthy exchange was moved to User talk:Equazcion to unburden this section. Equazcion •✗/C • 11:15, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nMy purpose for starting this discussion here was to solicit the experienced opinions of those who frequent this forum. I'd rather see the discussion continue here, especially since it involves the interpretation and possible revision of the \"Strong national ties\" guideline. -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nI only moved the portion that was mainly a heated back-and-forth with me and just one other user. I didn't want others to be discouraged from voicing their opinions here out of fear of butting in to a private feud. In that regard I also regret my part in that exchange, which I should have stopped responding to towards the beginning, so I felt it best to move it to my talk page instead. The general discussion should continue here. Equazcion •✗/C • 14:32, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nTo confuse things further: how is \"English-speaking country\" defined? As 89% of people in Sweden can speak English, does that make it an English-speaking country, despite it not being an official language? --ascorbic (talk)\n\nIf there is a disagreement, it would be difficult to find a convincing source to settle the matter. Suppose there is a disagreement about whether Sweden mostly uses the British or American variation of English. Where would we find a publication that surveyed the usage of English in Swedish media to determine what variety of English would be used. I seriously doubt we would find a publication titled The Swedish Heritage English Dictionary or The Stockholm University English Dictionary.\n\nAlso, this would put a burden on the English speaking editor, who may not be familiar with English language media in Sweden. --Gerry Ashton (talk)\n\nIt would put an equal burden on the UK/European English speaker who isn't familiar with American English. Also, with the sources argument you're applying our content sourcing rules to the spelling variety issue. There's nothing that says we need a reliable source to tell us explicitly that a country uses a certain variety. A cursory examination of their English-language media should, I think, suffice. Equazcion •✗/C • 16:46, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nThere is no such thing as \"European English\". Granted, a lot of (Continental) Europeans speak English, even very well in a reasonable fraction of cases. But as something they learned in school, not as an organic thing. You can't count that as a variety. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nThe burden I speak of for the English speaking editor who writes, in English, about a foreign topic is figuring out what variety of English is usually used in the country in question. If it is a new article, under the present convention, the editor could just use whatever variety he/she is most familiar with. If the editor does not live in the country in question, the editor may not know what English-language media outlets exist, or the relative popularity of the outlets. --Gerry Ashton (talk)\n\nTo repeat a comment that I made earlier (and was removed): I agree with Trovatore that there is a \"fragile balance\" in the usage guidelines. Looking back in the MOS history, that balance has been essentially unchanged in at least five years. The 7 January 2004 version included the statement \"Articles which focus on a topic specific to a particular English-speaking country should generally aim to conform to the spelling of that country.\" I believe the \"English-speaking country\" part was intentional and was meant not to include other countries where English is not the/a primary language. I suspect that all countries likely have some English-speaking segments.\n\nSo the question is: Should the guideline be reworded to change or refine what we consider to be an \"English-speaking country\"? (Personnaly, I think this is a can of worms better left alone.) -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nThat's the question. In the case of the Pirate Bay trial article, there is a dispute and it's a relatively new article. All we have to go on is the fact that the article creator used American style for a single word -- which I think is pretty shaky grounds and therefore understandably isn't turning out to be much of a dispute settler. I want to clarify that my personal take on this proposal is that this should only be a stipulation to be used as a dispute settler, in cases such as this, where the proper course of action isn't readily apparent -- not as a steadfast rule to be applied to articles that already have a clearly-established variety in place, or even as a rule that article creators need to worry about abiding by. Equazcion •✗/C • 21:38, 23 Feb 2009 (UTC)\n\nWhile most Swedes know English, I doubt they would read much (or indeed any) of the \"English-language media\" in Sweden. What would be the point, since all that and more is available in their Swedish media? They're much more likely to read the occasional English Wikipedia article, blogs and the like, or novels written in English. -- Coffee2theorems (talk)\n\nHello, fellow editors … I did a blanket italicize of e.g., i.e., and etc. … this was something impressed upon me over 20 years ago (in the dawn of electronic publishing) while working on an ANSI standard … OTOH, I realize that today there are many editors who share the opposing view of using italics for these abbreviations, so rather than just revert them (if you disagree), I wish you would post your reasons here. Happy Editing! — 138.88.32.143 (talk · contribs)\n\nOf course they should be italicized; they're foreign phrases. (Usage may be changing for etc., which is the most common; but we can follow when it happens.) Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nGood call ... I guess that \"foreign\" trumps \"abbreviation.\" — 138.88.32.143 (talk)\n\nNo, do not italicize i.e., e.g., or etc. They are very common terms that have been adapted into the English language. They should be familiar to readers so italics are completely unnecessary. Reywas92Talk\n\nI tend to agree. These are so well known that people use them without knowing or caring what the original Latin was, and more normal usage is without italics, surely? What do modern style manuals say? --Kotniski (talk)\n\nBut literate convention is to italicize them (etc. may be shifting, but hasn't finished): not because they're unfamiliar, but because they're Latin, like ex post facto. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nIs this a U.S./UK thing? To me on the right side of the pond, the italicized versions look fussy and pedantic. (As do the commas following i.e. and e.g., which I understand Americans tend to use.)--Kotniski (talk)\n\nI doubt it; American is my native tongue, but British pedants advocate italicization. Commas around parenthetical phrases may be more common in American, but e.g. should normally have the same punctuation as for example. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nEx post facto is not used in everyday language and most people don't know what it means, so it should be italicized. Everyone uses etc., i.e., and e.g., and their meanings are more well-known to English-speakers; they can be found in English dictionaries whereas other terms are not. There should not be commas after them, and that would be an error, not just an Americanism. Reywas92Talk\n\nNot in Reywas's every-day language, clearly; the United States Constitution, however, is not alien to literate American, which many of our articles should use. Similarly, i.e. and e.g. are italicized in literate English; as far as I know, of every dialect. I await actual evidence. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nI would generally italicize e.g., etc. and i.e. because of their Latin origin, as other editors have pointed out, but am not fussed if other editors choose not to. However, I would disagree with Reywas92 that commas are not to be used after them. E.g. means \"for example\", etc. means \"and so on\", and i.e. means \"that is\"; therefore, punctuation should be used with the abbreviations as they are used with the English phrases that they represent:\n\nIncorrect: Schools should focus on core skills e.g. reading, writing and mathematics.\n\nCorrect: Schools should focus on core skills, e.g. [for example], reading, writing and mathematics.\n\nIncorrect: We need to purchase some bread-baking ingredients such as eggs, flour, yeast etc.\n\nCorrect: We need to purchase some bread-baking ingredients such as eggs, flour, yeast, etc. [and so on.]\n\n— Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nWell we know to put the comma before e.g., i.e., and etc., it's after them that's debated. The following guides say not to italicize any of these three abbreviations:\n\n\"Do not use italics for the following expressions:... eg, etc ... ie...\"\n\n\"I.e. and e.g. are such common Latin abbreviations that they do not require italicization.\"\n\n\"Use a comma after usual italicized abbreviations, cf., e.g., et al., i.e., per se, a priori\"\n\n\"(no italics for: e.g., i.e., et al., etc., cf.)\"\n\n\"Please do not italicize words and abbreviations generally accepted in the English language (eg, inter alia, de facto, passim, ibid, ie etc).\"\n\n\"with the exception of very common expressions such as \"i.e.,\" \"e.g.,\" \"et al.,\" \"in vitro,\" \"ex vitro\" and \"etc.\"\n\n\"e.g., use parentheses, no italics...i.e.,: use parentheses, no italics\"\n\n\"(a priori, etc., i.e., e.g., et al., ex ante, and ex post are not italicized).\"\n\n\"Use roman for: etc.; cf.; e.g.; i.e.;\"\n\nThis one says to italicize i.e. and e.g., but not etc., and that they are never followed by a comma:\n\n\"Please note that \"e.g.\" and \"i.e.\" are in italics but \"etc.\" is not. (All are preceded by a comma but never followed by one, and are always in lower case.)\"\n\nI see no reason why these very common abbreviations need to be italicized. Reywas92Talk\n\nI agree. I've hardly ever seen them italicised, certainly not in encyclopedias. They're so widely used that they are as much part of the English language as literally millions of other words imported from other languages, that are not italicised. Ok, they are abbreviations of phrases, not of single words, but a lot of people wouldn't know, or care, what those phrases were, and so the only purpose in italicising them is for the writer to let the reader know that the writer knows they were originally a foreign phrsse, but without letting on what that foreign phrase was. That reeks of \"I know something you don't know, but I'm not telling\". It's dumb and silly. If they were spelled out, there might be a case for italicising them, but not when they're abbreviations. -- JackofOz (talk)\n\nIs there any consensus among Wikipedia editors about the italicization of, and use of a comma after, e.g., etc. and i.e.? If not, then I would suggest that the MoS be amended to mention that either usage is fine provided there is consistency within each article. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nIs there actually any good reason to use these in articles? They're abbreviations, and abbreviations for things that aren't that long. While undoubtedly some abbreviations are OK in an encyclopedia article (no one wants to write out Philosophiae Doctor), I would think that the correct solution is almost always to substitute that is and for example. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nThat's true. I hardly use them myself. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\n<Sigh!> There does not appear to be a consensus on this issue … I'll just chalk it up to the generation gap and MOVE ON … Happy Editing! — 138.88.32.143 (talk · contribs)\n\nWhen a time of an event is specified, it should be given in both local time (if applicable, and taking DST into account) and in UTC. GMT cannot be used as a substitute for UTC because it is not equivalent, and not traceable to UTC. -- Denelson83\n\nI think GMT and UTC are the same; UTC is maybe just a little more precisely defined. But how imprecise can GMT be? A second or two, max? Very very few WP articles need to state times more precisely than that; if they do, then fine, specify UTC, but it seems a little silly to worry about it in the general run of article.\n\nOn a similar note, I see no need to translate everything to GMT/UTC. If you're talking about, say, an event in space, then sure, makes sense. But why would you give, for example, the time of Barack Obama's inauguration in GMT? It didn't happen in London. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nUTC did not come to exist until 1961, so can't be used for dates before then. The general term, which can be traced back as far as desired (with gradually decreasing precision), is UT. UT is not really necessary except when events in various parts of the world need to be compared. --Gerry Ashton (talk)\n\nGMT properly refers to UT1, a special case of solar time. UTC is tied to atomic clocks, and time zones around the world all use offsets from UTC.\n\nOkay, then a dual UTC/local time stamp should only be applied if the referred event occurs after January 1, 1961, since that is the first day of UTC. Also, if you gave the time of an event of worldwide significance in UTC, it can potentially make it simpler for the reader to convert that time into the time in his/her own local time zone. -- Denelson83\n\nEven if you are correct that \"GMT properly refers to UT1\" (our article UT1 disagrees), my point stands — the difference between UTC and UT1 is less than a second, so it's a useless distinction in 99.9% of the cases. On those extremely rare instances where there's any value in giving times to a precision of less than a second (I imagine these will be primarily astronomy articles) then sure, specify which time you mean.\n\nI don't agree that making it slightly easier to determine when an event happened in one's own time zone is sufficient justification to make some encyclopedia-wide edict about giving London time for everything. What is this even good for? Do you really read about something that happened at 3:30-ish in Topeka and say \"hey, what was I doing at that moment\"? And if you do, well, it's not hard to figure out. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nI tend to agree. Local time is sometimes useful to provide context (day/night/morning/evening) or to show a timeline of events (such as for Chernobyl), but I do not think it should be mandatory to convert to UTC. If needed, a timezone reference may be just as appropriate, and avoids the need to deal with date boundaries. As for UTC vs GMT, I recognize that UTC is technically the preferred term, but I also believe that GMT is a common-usage equivalent for UTC when sub-second accuracy is not required and may even be more recognizable to the general audience outside the technical and scientific community. Even NASA uses GMT in many of its public relations materials. So in both cases, I'd suggest leaving the options open for editors to use their discretion. -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nI think that times should always be given in local time. Additionally, I think that the UTC time should be given once for any specific sequence of evenmts in an article. For example, in describing the September 11 attacks (all the events happened in the United States Eastern Time Zone during daylight savings time, which is UTC-4), it should say \"At 8:46 a.m. (12:46 UTC), American Airlines Flight 11 was...\" (this is the first reference to a specific clock time); in the rest of the section, it should just mention the local times. עוד מישהו Od Mishehu\n\nNow that makes much more sense to me. Mention the UTC time, but don't overdo it. If anyone wants to know all of the times in UTC, it just comes down to simple arithmetic if all of the times are within a relatively short duration. -- Denelson83\n\nOf course, the time of the September 11 attacks is not known to sub-second accuracy, but strictly speaking, civil time in the US was not defined to be an offset from UTC until the passage of H.R. 2272: 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007. Before then, it was an offset from GMT and the precise meaning was up for grabs. --Gerry Ashton (talk)\n\nI think there's an important point that I'm not getting across here. It's a general principle that precision should not exceed accuracy (or at least, should not exceed it by much). You wouldn't, for example, say that Noah's ark was 30 cubits (15.572894 meters) across.\n\nSimilarly here. If we're quibbling on GMT versus UTC, it suggests that we know times to less than a second, which is almost never the case. If UTC were the recognized term even when one doesn't have that sort of accuracy available, then I suppose that would be OK, but it isn't (it's come out in the discussion that it wasn't even defined before 1961).\n\nSo when it is really necessary to give a world-wide time (I think this is rare) just stick with good old-fashioned Zulu, unless the accuracy needed to make the distinction is really there (and there's some reason to want to make it). Anything else is misleading. --Trovatore (talk)\n\n\"Zulu\" is not an appropriate term because it is rather colloquial and is only one of several phonetics for the letter \"Z\". It is really the letter \"Z\" that is widely understood to mean Universal Time. I suggest that \"UT\" is a better term because it is well defined yet not specific as to which of several related time scales is intended (UT1, UT2, or UTC). --Gerry Ashton (talk)\n\nI didn't literally mean to put the word Zulu in the article. I meant put GMT in the article (in what I still maintain is the rare case that it's useful to have a worldwide standard); I was just calling it \"Zulu\" in a conversational tone. Sorry to have caused confusion.\n\nI think GMT is better than UT because it's more widely understood, and precisely because it's not precisely defined. Precision should not exceed accuracy; vide supra. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nI did a bit of original research by conducting a survey of one (my daughter). I asked if she knew what GMT was – she did. I asked her if she knew what UTC was – she didn't. After I briefly explained the difference, she commented that she had always heard it referred to as GMT. I realize this was a severely limited and unscientific survey, but it does support the case that GMT is a more recognizable common-use term outside the technical community. Thus I think this term should be allowed or even preferred in non-technical articles and should be left intact if already present. -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nWe had this one here. Yet I thought it was time to bring it up again.\n\nThe exclusive use of straight quotes and apostrophes (see preceding section) is recommended. They are easier to type in reliably, and to edit.\n\nThis recommendation doesn't make any sense. Yes, “xyz” is harder to type than \"xyz\", but that's what the MediaWiki:Edittools are there for. The MoS also encourages the use of en dashes (–) and em dashes (—) instead of hyphens (-) or double-hyphens (--), although it's a lot easier to type that last one. In my opinion, this recommendation should be reversed, saying curly quotes are actually the ones recommended. --bender235 (talk)\n\nHell no, they are ugly as hell(I was thinking of the french quotes, still opposed to the idea however) and a pain to edit. Straight quotes is much saner to recommend. The analogy with en dashes and em dashes is flawed, the first indicates a union, the other indicates a break. Curly vs straight doesn't change anything in meaning. Headbomb {ταλκκοντριβς – WP Physics}\n\nWell, the quotes differentiate openings from closings; and the world obviously doesn't concur with your view that they're ugly (since they are used as standard in print). I don't see why they can't be generated automatically by the software (except in a few exceptional cases where we might need a special wikitext syntax).--Kotniski (talk)\n\nI thought the main reason for avoiding the use of curly quotation marks and apostrophes was that \"Mixed use interferes with some searches, such as those using the browser's search facility (a search for Korsakoff's syndrome could fail to find Korsakoff’s syndrome and vice versa)\": Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation characters. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThey're still ugly, and there may be a difference in standards between print media and online media.\n\nThe search problem seems a compelling reason for not using them in contractions and possessives, but doesn't really seem definitive for quotations. More to the point, this distinction probably means it cannot be generated automatically. — Arthur Rubin (talk)\n\nMS Word seems to manage it. In fact, in the font I always see WP pages displayed in, the curly ones don't look curly anyway. But it makes a difference in page titles (and in some other header styles I think). And I guess it depends whether you grew up reading books or computer screens, but for me the curly forms are aesthetically superior.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nJackLee, this is not about article naming. It's only about the text in the article. Matter of fact there are characters for openings and closings of quotations (“”), so it's is clearly better to use them then using the poor substitute (\") just because it happens to be on your average keyboard. We also use &prime; (′) and &Prime; (″) for ft and in or min and sec instead of apostrophes (') and quotations (\"), simply because the latter would not be correct typography. --bender235 (talk)\n\nI don't disagree that curly quotes look nicer, though I've grown used to the straight ones.\n\nFrom my reading of \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation characters\", the concern is that a reader using his or her browser's search facility (e.g., CTRL-F) to search for terms containing quotation marks and apostrophes would be unable to find them if the curly versions were used, since ' is considered a different character from ’. Arthur Rubin is probably right in saying that this is more an issue for apostrophes rather than quotation marks since it's less likely that people will search for text fragments with quotation marks in them. Of course, a reader can avoid the problem by searching for, say, \"Korsakoff\" instead of \"Korsakoff's syndrome\", but this assumes that the person realizes the difference between ' and ’.\n\nI suppose it is also not likely that users will search for text with ′ and ″ in it. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nReal curly quotes (like, say, the ones you get in LaTeX) might look nicer. Unfortunately they're not an option, at least with my fontset. The so-called curly quotes get rendered as basically two rectangles stuck together, with the wider rectangle at the bottom on the left set of quotes, and at the top on the right. In my judgment these are hideous, and as long as they're the best we can do, we should stick with straight quotes. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nWe got the decision wrong with dashes and have rendered them unsearchable as a result. We should not be repeating that mistake anywhere else. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nSeriously, who is searching for a dash or a quotation mark? I mean, for example, if you were looking for that quote (“phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq”) in the Barack Obama article, using CTRL-F in your browser, why would you type it with quotation marks? Type it w/out the marks, and you'll find it. I really don't see why we should use incorrect typography just because of some peoples inability to use their browser search. --bender235 (talk)\n\nBecause if you don't use quotation marks, you'll find any article which contains all the words, in any order. If you're searching for something that doesn't contain buzzwords of 2009, that's not enough. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nAre we still talking about the browser search (CTRL+F), or did you switch to Wikipedia search? --bender235 (talk)\n\nI'm talking about find-in-page, along with finding in text editors. If you don't think searching for a dash is a common use case, you've never tried to look for \"07-08\" in a list of football statistics. But thanks for the regular dose of \"you're a moron, we shouldn't cater to you and your barbarian hordes\" we've come to look forward to in WT:MOS. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nIf you can't find \"07-08\", why not search \"07–08\"? Again, why should Wikipedia use wrong typography only because some people might not know how to use a browser search. Or do you try to obviate the risk that some one might be unable to find a certain quote because he doesn't realize he better type it in his browser search without the quotation marks? That's just ridiculous. What's next? Ban the use of special characters like ð in Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, just because a slight percentage of people might not find that character on their computer? Seriously, you need to realize that hyphens, minus signs, and en dashes are different characters for a reason. Using a hyphen where a en dashes belongs is wrong typography. Using an x where a × belongs is wrong typography. Using a quotation mark (\") where a prime (″) belongs is wrong typography. Once again, we don't do ASCII art here. --bender235 (talk)\n\nI'm nor sure where you got a keyboard with an en dash one it, but mine doesn't have one. Personally, I think we should be optimising for people who want to search for text with their keyboards rather than striving for a typographical purity which makes regular editing impractical for mortals with small character sets. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nYou mean searching by readers, not editing, I presume? (Editors have all the characters supplied under the edit box.) To provide the best service to readers, we have to take various factors into account (including correctness of typography, ease of searching and others.) I think the majority of our readers would value correctness above the ability to search for something they hardly ever search for (and can copy-and-paste from the text in many cases). We can hope that browser manufacturers will improve their search functions so that hyphens match dashes and curlies match straight and so on; this isn't a problem that applies only to Wikipedia pages.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nIf you think all our editors are happy using that little Javascript box to enter characters as mundane as a dash then - well, actually, considering that you seem to think that it's obvious that readers \"value correctness above\" whatever, then I'd love to hear your explanation for why we've discouraged curly quotes outright for all this time. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nOkay, so the character set allowed in Wikipedia articles should be limited to what's on your keyboard? So I guess that's it for all articles containing π, ß, ¿ or €. And numerous others. --bender235 (talk)\n\nThere is a difference between searching for a character which is very obviously not in the standard ASCII character set and once which differs from its analogue in the ASCII character set only in the minds (and indeed the eyes) of a minority of editors. Yes, browser search functionality could be enhanced to catch these, but it's unlikely that in the near future any browser edit box will be able to seamlessly pair off curly quotes with one another as word processors currently do. I am somewhat non-keen to go through another round of beating down straw men on this issue. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nI think you seriously need to realize that despite - and – or \" and ″ might look alike, they're still totally different characters. They are not interchangeable. It's not about what looks correct in my eyes, but what in fact is correct. You can't subsitute ß for β, or p for ρ, or a for α. It's just not correct. ––bender235 (talk)\n\nYou're clinging to a fantasy. The only convention Wikipedia must follow is that which it chooses for itself, and in making that choice there is no single factor that automatically trumps all others. Yes, it'd be nice to achieve what you mistakenly call orthographic \"correctness\", but not if it's at the expense of more important principles. Ilkali (talk)\n\nOkay, so let's give up correct orthography and typography. It just has to look like it is correct. So who cares if there's a p for a ρ? Heck, why not use I instead of l. Spell Illinois or lIIinois – it looks alike, so who cares? Am I right? This is ridiculous. --bender235 (talk)\n\n\"Spell Illinois or lIIinois – it looks alike, so who cares? Am I right?\" No, you're wrong again. The latter rendering would cause problems for searching, computational analysis, etc, and there's no benefit to not spelling the word the normal way. Are you beginning to see yet? We don't follow external conventions just because they're there. Ilkali (talk)\n\nSo you assume people can tell a l from a I (look alike, but not that same character), but not a - from a — (also look alike, but not the same character). Okay, I got it. We'll never solve that one. --bender235 (talk)\n\n\"So you assume people can tell a l from a I\". Did you even read my comment? I didn't say anything about visual distinctiveness. Ilkali (talk)\n\nI read your comment. You say people who'd type \"lIInois\" (incorrect) in their browser search wouldn't find \"Illinois\" (correct), because it's wrong characters. Also, if they type \"07-08\" (incorrect) they won't find \"07–08\" (correct). That implies that you assume Wikipedia readers to think that Wikipedia is written with wrong characters on purpose, in terms of characters not on keyboards. Yet I don't agree with that. --bender235 (talk)\n\nThis concept of \"wrong typography\" is nonsensical. There is no right or wrong in semiotics, just conventional and unconventional. What you don't understand is that conventions are observed for the reason that, and to the extent to which, they make communication more effective. There is no divine mandate to follow an externally-defined convention in cases where it makes things more difficult for everyone. Different contexts carry different constraints and call for different conventions. Live with it. Ilkali (talk)\n\n← The hyphen, en dash, and em dash have distinct roles (adjunction, disjunction, and break/parenthesis, respectively) in English, as do the letters 'I' and 'L'; the p and ρ; etc. A pair of curly quotes and a pair of straight quotes do not. The prime may be an exception—I recall most Internet sources replacing it with an apostrophe, so I suppose that it's just common practice. π, ß, ¿, and € are not replaceable by any ASCII characters, but curly quotes are (by straight quotes).\n\nBender, to address the statement on your talk page (\"This rule (using wrong characters just because it's easier that way) just doesn't make any sense, so ignore it.\"): Straight quotes are not wrong characters. My conjecture would be that Wikipedia prefers ASCII over Unicode if the ASCII char does not play a distinct role, but exceptions can be made if the vast majority of people use Unicode (e.g. apostrophes in place of primes, Greek variables in math articles). —LOL T/C\n\nThe hyphen, en dash, and em dash have distinct roles (adjunction, disjunction, and break/parenthesis, respectively) in English, as do the letters 'I' and 'L'; the p and ρ; etc. A pair of curly quotes and a pair of straight quotes do not.\n\nThat's where you're wrong. A “ marks the beginning of a quotation, while ” marks the end. Replacing them with \"\" doesn't do the trick (just 50% of it, actually). But okay, it seems like there's an overwhelming majority in the English Wikipedia advocating the use of \"\" instead of “” (it's exactly the opposite situation in the German Wikipedia, so you know where I'm coming from). I can live with that. --bender235 (talk)\n\nIt's true that the left curly is different from the right curly, but I was trying to say that \"A pair of curly quotes and a pair of straight quotes\" (emphasis added) are no different. That is, ”foo“ is incorrect, but there is no difference between “bar” and \"bar\" as far as English is concerned (I don't know about German, though). I don't see how straight quotes don't do the trick for humans; I have no trouble identifying the beginning and end of each quotation (and the Wikipedia font on my computer is Arial)! —LOL T/C\n\nNow I'm wondering if the MOS contradicts itself; here are some excerpts:\n\n\"There are two options when considering the look of the quotation marks ...\n\nTypewriter or straight style ...\n\nTypographic or curly style ...\"\n\n\"Styling of apostrophes and quotes ... should all be straight, not curly;\"\n\n\"The exclusive use of straight quotes and apostrophes ... is recommended.\"\n\nDoes #1 contradict #2 and #3? —LOL T/C\n\nNot really. #1 is really just pointing out the existence of two different prevailing forms; it isn't saying that either may be used. if the reader is left uncertain by #1, he's not going to be left uncertain by the time he gets to #2 and #3. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nThat's what I had hoped for, but I'm afraid that users may misinterpret \"There are two options\" (in existence) as \"There are two options to be used in Wikipedia articles\" (example), and then don't get to #2 and #3. Do you think we can reword it in such a way that it cannot mislead readers? I'm thinking about mimicking the format of WP:ELLIPSIS, so:\n\n—LOL T/C\n\nFine by me. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nI have recently encountered, forced more pointedly, a small cadre of editors that demand that a TOCright is not acceptable. Reasoning with them that it removes white space, makes article easier to read, and allows the article to appear more like \"hard print\" articles are met with those being insufficient to merit its use. In reviewing guidelines I have yet to find when it can and when it can't be used. In addition, it seems like these editors ignore all attempt at consensus because TOCright is not the norm. I know this topic has been discussed here and elsewhere. The current guidance here just leaves it open-ended. Some further guidance would be appreciated. Cheers. --StormRider\n\nAlert! The request above comes with baggage and contains language that represents only one side of a dispute regarding Storm Rider's strong protection of his favored format. Here are the relevant links:\n\nFormatting discussion\n\nMore eyes needed at Golden Plates\n\nPlease read them first and factor them into any response. One admin has already expressed a willingness to censure or block Storm Rider for his \"personal attacks and other such nonsense\" in this matter.\n\nOTOH, the request contains elements that do deserve an answer independently of any existing dispute(s). -- Fyslee (talk)\n\nPlease do not confuse the issue; your hounding is again noted. The only topic I am addressing is floating TOC (right or left). Your unwelcome desire to confuse the issue is dissappointing. I get it that you have begun to follow me around and begun to edit articles that you have never edited before and are areas that I have long participated; regardless, the only topic we are discussing is floating TOC. --StormRider\n\nI have answered on your talk page. BTW, I have always been interested in Mormonism. My parents lived in Provo for several years and I received (yes, free!) the Book of Mormon when in the temple in Salt Lake City and then acquired the Pearl of Great Price and Doctrine and Covenants and read them all. Interesting reading. -- Fyslee (talk)\n\nIgnoring the personal attacks (which are really another issue entirely), it's that TOCright isn't the norm which is the problem here rather than any other consideration. In my experience, TOCright is frequently used in situations where either {{TOClimit}} would suffice or where there's no need for an override in the first place. Golden plates is no different from any numberof articles which cope fine without overriding the TOC, and in addition has a lede image which would interfere with it. Those who advocate the use of TOCright in the general case (i.e. where there's no specific reason for overriding other than the general subjective concerns expressed in Storm Rider's first post in this thread) should be trying to get the default changes rather than causing the layout of the odd article to be arbitrarily inconsistent with the rest of the encyclopedia. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nWhat about TOCleft, which is Storm Rider's normally preferred format? Would it be appropriate to tweak the guidelines to include something like this: \"Personal preference is not a legitimate reason for not using the default TOC. Other, significant reasons should be used to justify deviating from the default TOC.\" ? BTW, he has also left a slightly different version of his comment here. -- Fyslee (talk)\n\nLeft-floated elements should be used sparingly if ever. Again, the chief issue is that adding them without any further justification than \"I like this layout generally\" should be discouraged on the grounds that it burdens the reader with a harder task of finding and using the TOC if its placement is entirely dependent on the whims of the article's last editor. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nSparingly is not very clear. The TOC delete discussion provided that there were only a few hundred articles in 2006 that used it. I believe I stated above that the reason I prefer use a floating layout was to remove white space, make articles easier to read, and reflect hard printing styles where white space is anathema. I find it difficult to believe that readers will be confused when they find a TOC on the left rather than the right and that confusion will lead to being unable to read the TOC; that seems a specious argument.\n\nTo provide more clarification as to when floating may be used will prevent exactly the arguments you present above, \"I like it this way\" and \"I prefer it the other way\". Currently, no direction is given except that it may be used and now the only discussion can really evolve around how many people on a given article prefer it one way or the other, which seems fruitless. Clarification will end this discussion in its entirety. --StormRider\n\nI've replied below. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nMy motivation for asking the question is bigger than one article; it applies to Wikipedia as a whole and really is about TOC floating. There is a default setting so that any editor can begin a new article and the TOC defaults to a specific place; it simplifies the editing process. However, as editors learn more about editing, they gain the ability to choose where to place items, TOC in this instance, but what is not provided is when can we manipulate TOC placement. It appears to me that it can be very subjective. When you review the discussion marked above for TOCright (TOC floating in general) to be deleted, there was a multiple of editors that voted to keep it rather than to delete. Editors did express a reserve about when it should be used, but no clarification was then provided to guide. Is it always subjective? Are default settings inflexible? If consensus is to guide, does every article formating need to be discussed/argued? When articles appear \"different\" in this minor formatting does it destroy the reading experience of readers? Is uniformity valuable above all else? Can some diversity in the formatting of TOC be allowed and if so under what parameters?\n\nFor me personally, I detest white space. I enjoy seeing a flow from the introduction into the body with boxes, pictures, TOC, tables etc. interspersed throughout without a break or introduction of white space. I appreciate when our articles reflect the same standards of hard print articles. I would like to see more clarification provided so that format diversity are allowed and direct under what circumstances diversity can exist. Doing so will further minimize edit warring and all editors will be empowered to know when it acceptable and when it is not. Cheers. --StormRider\n\nWell, the answer to \"when can it be used\" is simple. When both of the following conditions are met:\n\nIt is established that the readability / presentation of the article, were it to use the standard TOC layout, would be adversely affected compared to regular articles;\n\nThere is consensus to do so.\n\nThat one may place a TOC where one wishes does not imply that one should. Despite this being framed as \"a few zealous editors removing TOCright out of personal preference\", it seems obvious that only a few editors believe that the TOC's default placement adversely affects the project; in general, leaving the defaults as they are ensures that our article structure is more consistent, easier to emulate when writing new articles, and furthermore easier to adjust if the default TOC styling every is changed (as all articles which don't currently override it will pick up on the change). It should certainly not be overridden lightly based on personal preference. This is basically the same rule that applies to everything prescribed by the Manual of Style. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nSo then how does one determine \"adversely\" affects the project? Does white space qualify or not? Is concensus the only determinator then? It seems subjective to the group involved; a group of editors decides the article default adversely affects format, consensus is achieved, TOC if floated. Six weeks later editor X comes by, sees a format not in default format, changes it to default and instant edit war ensues. I think the MOS needs to be more clear because it currently is anything but clear and the only parameter is can consensus be achieved. There is no definition to \"adversely affects\". Adverse to one is welcomed by another. --StormRider\n\nBy discussion, precedent, and proposed changes to the wording which would clarify it. For instance, the article referred to earlier (golden plates) has a very common layout, and empirical evidence suggests that it is extremely uncommon that the TOC is floated in similar articles. On the other hand, List of diseases (S) is so long that it uses its own entirely unique, hand-hacked TOC. It would appear from the wording you've used in your replies thus far that you have a rather different standard to that of most editors when it comes to TOC placement; you may vey well have a point, but you'd be better trying to effect a global change in the TOC placement guidelines rather than arguing piecemeal for their inclusion on a given set of articles. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nCan you please direct me to a description of that process so that I may begin it. My only objective is to create, contribute to, and assist in maintaining excellent articles. There is no reason for an edit war on this simply topic. Format is important and clarifying the language and seekingn consensus would be beneficial for all. --StormRider\n\nI'm no expert on such global guideline shifts. Many of the regulars on WT:MOS are, however; hopefully one of them can assist. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nOkay, I will wait for one of them to offer some guidance. --StormRider\n\nI too think Storm Rider's interest in getting clear(er) guidelines is legitimate and that would help the situation. Right now the default is an automatic TOC (no use of a TOC code) that automatically creates white space, so the default (deliberately intended result) for nearly all (99.999%? ;-) regular articles and lists is white space after the LEAD and before the first heading.\n\nPersonally I am more interested in consistency throughout Wikipedia than I am with white space/no white space. We just need consistent formatting. If we decide that no white space is to be the default, that would be fine with me. In the current dispute, the TOCleft was creating a messed up article with both right and left margins darting in and out around the TOCleft and an image. It didn't look good, so for me it was detrimental to the appearance of the article, which is a reason given for not floating the TOC. Normally we shouldn't use the code at all, except in lists and under very unusual circumstances with very good objective grounds for deviating from the default. Subjective preferences are not (never?) legitimate grounds for deviating from the default MOS. When it comes to MOS, especially formatting, I don't think personal preference or editorial consensus among the few editors at some article should be allowed to override defaults. Those defaults should be universal and decided at policy/guideline level.\n\nIf we go for a floated TOC with no white space, I'd vote for a TOCright, and any images nearby also to stay on the right, so the text is in one block on the left. Why? Because it's most important that the left margin is preserved all the way to the left. -- Fyslee (talk)\n\nWhat would be the correct capitalization of this? Freedom of the city redirects to Freedom of the City which starts \"Freedom of the city is an honour....\" --Derek Andrews (talk)\n\nA Google search seems to strongly favour the capitalization of the 'C'. Have you considered asking at Talk:Freedom of the City? —LOL T/C\n\n\"Freedom of the City\" is the honor usually called \"Key to the City\" in the U.S., an honorary award. Because \"He was given a key to the city\" or \"He was given the freedom of the city\" might easily be misinterpreted, especially by someone from another country who isn't familiar with the phrase, and since in any individual instance, it's a proper noun, capitalize it as a proper noun in Wikipedia. But I can't see capitalizing \"keys to the city\" because one requirement for being a proper noun is that there's just one of them. (\"Both Senators Schumer and Franken ...\" is okay because it's elliptical for \"Senator Schumer and Senator Franken\"; compare with \"two senators, Schumer and Franken, ...\") - Dan Dank55 (push to talk)\n\nI'm against capitalizing senator and using it as a title in Wikipedia. We don't call people Mr. or Dr., so we shouldn't call them Senator. Use it lower case and postnominally only. --Trovatore (talk)\n\nThank you both.--Derek Andrews (talk)\n\nThere is no mention of how to cope with this. Specifically when you are using a title that references another title.じんない\n\nGenerally, the internal phrase that would normally be italicized as a title loses its italics, e.g., \"Shakespeare's Macbeth and its Impact on Scottish Identity\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI'm also talking about when using descriptive titles in citations which are unofficial, specifically for translated works or sites that do not have a title (while rare with reliable sources, it does happen) since the citation template for cite web auto-italicizes all titles.\n\nThere are also some times when such titles do still italicize the original work.じんない\n\nNot sure what you mean exactly. Can you provide an example? {{Citation}} allows you to reverse the italicization of certain parts of a title, but I don't know about {{Cite web}}. See the example below:\n\nWikitext: {{citation|author=Bill Testing|title=Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' and its Impact on Scottish Identity|location=Testingland|publisher=It's a Test Publishing|year=2009}}.\n\nResult: Bill Testing (2009), Shakespeare's Macbeth and its Impact on Scottish Identity, Testingland: It's a Test Publishing .\n\n— Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nPleased to announce that the Chemistry MOS has been ratified by WP:CHEMISTRY. --Rifleman 82 (talk)\n\nJust noticed that MOS:SCROLL is the shortcut for WP:MOS#Scrolling lists but also claims to be the shortcut for WP:ACCESS#Scrolling and collapsible sections.

I've just got a question here. A while ago, I tried to put line breaks between genres in an artist infobox, but I was told that according to the Manual of Style, they have to be listed as a sentence, only the first genre is a capital, and it has to be alphabetical order.\n\nI then noticed someone who tried to do what I did. I reverted him, citing those reasons, and I explained on his talk page. He's ignored me and did it twice more. The diffs is question are here, here, and here. The anon who did it was 74.81.243.250.\n\nWas what I did correct? Are the genres supposed to be listed as a sentence, only the first genre has a capital, and it has to be listed in alphabetical order? If so, was my warning to the guy justified since he did it more than once? If my warnings were justified, what action can be taken to prevent him from repeating this action?\n\nThanks! 58.166.184.238 (talk)\n\nWhich part of the Manual of Style are you relying on for the proposition that different musical genres must be listed in a sentence in the Musician infobox? I don't believe MoS addresses this issue at all. This may be a guideline laid down by the editors active at the WikiProject which uses the Musician infobox, in which case the discussion should be taken there. Personally, both methods of presenting musical genres (list vs. sentence) seem fine to me, though of course the list method makes the infobox longer, which may disrupt the layout of the article. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThe relevant topic is actually WP:accessibility. Infobox data fields should contain one point per cell; line breaks confuse screen readers. This either means changing the infobox or mandating that commas be used instead of line breaks. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nSo, are both methods acceptable? I'm afraid I don't really understand what you mean. Are you saying there's a mandate that commas be used, or are you saying something completely different? (Sorry for the trouble). —Preceding unsigned comment added by 58.166.184.238 (talk)\n\nIt's not widely listened to in some parts of the project, but yes - line breaks should not be used as delimeters in infobox data fields. Ideally, there should be one item per table cell, but if not then commas will do. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nAh, righto. Thanks for that. So, if I see the user do this again, what would be the best course of action? 58.166.184.238 (talk)\n\nRevert the change, and politely explain in the edit summary or on the talk page that you are doing so to comply with \"Wikipedia:Accessibility\". — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThanks! —Preceding unsigned comment added by 58.166.184.238 (talk)\n\nHello. He's done it again. I told him on his talk page. What do I do if it happens again? because he's ignored me three times before. 58.169.162.12 (talk)\n\nIf the editor has violated the three-revert rule and refuses to discuss the matter on his talk page or the talk page of the article (probably a better place for the discussion to take place since the editor is an anonymous IP), then report the matter at \"Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Edit warring\". You might also try to have the article semi-protected by filing a request at \"Wikipedia:Requests for page protection\", but the administrators managing that page are usually reluctant to protect pages unless there is persistent vandalism. Also, since you are also an anonymous IP, page protection would prevent you from editing the article. (Have you considered creating an account for yourself?) — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nHe hasn't violated 3RR; I think he's on the other side of the globe from me, so our edits are pretty far apart. i suppose I'll bring it to the article talk page, and request page protection if it happens again after that.\n\nAbout creating an account, I have considered it, but for now I feel more comfortable editing anonymously since I don't edit all that often. I will probably create one if a few of the pages I go to get semi-protected around the same time.\n\nThanks for your input! 58.169.162.12 (talk)\n\nThis guideline is pretty freakin' long. Anyone think some sort of split is warranted? Equazcion •✗/C • 04:08, 4 Mar 2009 (UTC)\n\nI agree it is long, but this may be a case were it is justified. It is advantageous to have a summary of the most commonly referenced style guidelines in one place, so that once an editor finds this page, the topic of interest is likely only one click away from the table of contents. That said, I also believe that a detailed table of contents is needed for this guideline, so I disagree with the use of {{toclimit|limit=2}} in the current version. For example, if I'm looking for guidance on dashes I must click Punctuation and then scroll down seven or eight pages. I'd rather be able to view the full TOC (even if I have to scroll) so I can pick out a detailed topic, such as Em dashes. -- Tcncv (talk)\n\nAt least as far as the TOC is concerned, I think they become useless and ignored when they get that long. TOCs are suppose to be a means of cutting to a general section of a page, rather than an extensive list of specifics on a page. There are too many specific headers in this page for it to be of its intended use if left unchecked. But let's see what other have to say about that. Equazcion •✗/C • 07:54, 4 Mar 2009 (UTC)\n\nThe real solution is to trim. We don't need to say most of this stuff, and much of what we say isn't what English does. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nOr... We could try out something original. What about a two-step approach? Restrict the table of contents to primary headings, and create secondary ToCs for each section (except those with only one sub-section). It would divide the page into easily manageable segments for navigational purposes, and allow editors unfamiliar with the Manual to go quickly where they want, without getting lost in a long list.\n\nEither that, or a custom-made ToC for the top, more table-like, with prominent section names or some other feature (I am not sure collapsibility is possible) allowing for clear grouping of the primary sections.

I am not dissatisfied with the size of the table of contents, but some editors are. It is for them that I suggest this alternative as a concession. -- Wavelength (talk)\n\nRegulars here will be aware of the long-standing and widely recognised need to rationalise WP's Manual of Style, which has spread like topsy over the years. A particular problem was our advice on linking, for years expressed at no fewer than three locations: MOSLINK (now WP:LINKING), WP: CONTEXT, and the small Build the web. User:Kotniski did a fine job several months ago of rationalising them into one page (MOSLINK), and gained local consensus, after a merger had been flagged on all three pages for months. Compromises were made to gain the support of Build the web people. I'm sure editors have since been grateful to find advice on linking in just one place.\n\nBuild the web comprises just a few paragraphs that were mostly unobjectionable and obvious in the context of a wiki, but of a tone and content that IMO is largely unsuitable for a style guide; it contained almost nothing that is not now at MOSLINK (LINKING), whether using the same words or paraphrased.\n\nOver the past week, however, a few editors have come in and resurrected WP:BTW without substantive reason (none has been expressed, at least), insisting that it be an official guideline. On its talk page, I have written out and numbered each of the sentences at BTW, asking that reasons for their existence at a separate MoS be provided.\n\nThus far, there has been absolutely no response on that count. Instead, suggestions that BTW should go back to being an historical relic, as originally agreed, are met by accusations by a User:Locke Cole such as that Kotniski and I are \"expanding [our] MOS power grab beyond MOS pages\".\n\nI bring this to your attention because it is disappointing to see mighty pressure to turn back the clock on a progressive move towards rationalising the MoS. I hope that it's not a spin-off from the \"date-delinking\" case, still going, at ArbCom (although I have no evidence of that). If it succeeded, it would call into question the long-term viability of the Wikipedia:WikiProject_Manual_of_Style, which was set up only last year to try to encourage and manage such rationalisations. Perhaps Kotniski and I are failing to understand something of which experienced editors here might be able to apprise us. Tony (talk)\n\nHow editwarring over a non-MOS page (like Build the Web) is \"rationalizing MOS\" is a mystery.\n\nTony's use of fragmentation, however, is worthy of Humpty-Dumpty: \"When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.\" The \"fragmentation\" consists of having a merge, determined upon in January by a small bunch of editors, over protest, undone in February. Septentrionalis PMAnderson\n\nAs many of those who keep tabs here know, there has been an ongoing arbitration case on (de)linking chronological items. One of the clerks has started the framework for perhaps the most intricate RfC on the issue yet, which includes date autoformatting and other definitions of said feature. Please see User:Ryan Postlethwaite/Date linking RfC for the draft of the RfC and discuss its scope and questions at its corresponding discussion page. Opinions on the formatting of such an RfC are welcome here. Dabomb87 (talk)\n\nI came across a series of edits today wherein the editor was adding an additional period (.) at the end of sentences that ended with p.m. or a person's initials, as [As well as a small role in All Grown Up!, as Sulky Boy's band member J.T.. here]. I'm a bit confused and don't know for certain if this is erroneous or not. Could someone provide some insight here? Wildhartlivie (talk)\n\nThat's absolutely improper. An abbreviating period and a terminal period are never used together in English. One period and one period only in all the cases you describe.—DCGeist (talk)\n\nIf a template transcluded across pages (such as {{Current MKs}}) contains a word with different American and British spellings, and different pages which transclude it use different spellings (in this case, Dan Meridor and Amir Peretz use British spellings, while most MK articles use American), which spelling should the template use? עוד מישהו Od Mishehu\n\nIdeally, I suppose, the template ought to contain a parameter which determines the spelling, using syntax something like:\n\n{{#switch:{{{spelling|}}}|GB=colour|color}}\n\nOr have two different versions of the template.--Kotniski (talk)\n\nHaving 2 different versions of a template which is likely to be changed about half a dozen times a year is probably a bad idea. The specific template I'm talking about is {{Current"
