        "text": "Hi! There are two DRs in this page, one of 2009-10 (closed), one of 2010-03. Is there some formating to do in it to make that clearer (in Commons:Deletion_requests/2010/03/24#File:Ste_Mere_Eglise_Paratroopers_from_Heaven.jpg it's not clear at all). Thanks. --GaAs11671\n\nNo, see the log. The same file (299334216 from flickr) was already uploaded under the same name and nominated for deletion. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nYes, I understood that. My question was about some form of archiving the 1rst discussion on the DR page, so that it doesn't appears in the 2010/03/24 page. --GaAs11671\n\nIts the regular way, that older deletion discussions are shown. If you dont want to have it on the log you can add <noinclude>...(old request)...</noinclude> arround the old request. However, in this case a deletion discussion is not even necessary, the case is clear. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI was thinking of something like Template:Collapse, but it's not very important. Thanks. --GaAs11671\n\nI deployed a zooming image viewer on the toolserver. This is particularly useful to look at large images. It downloads multiresolution data incrementally (so you don't have to download the entire image, just the stuff you are actually looking at, good for low bandwidth, but also much faster for browsing images). There is a flash and a JavaScript version available. You can activate the ZoomViewer gadget in your preferences (Gadgets->Improved navigation) to show links to the viewer on the image description pages. Some examples:\n\nGlacier pano 480MP\n\nHong Kong Skyline 94MP\n\nChicago Skyline 117MP\n\nGeological Map of Minnesota 250MP\n\nNGC 6357 149MP\n\nDenver Airport 111MP\n\nThose examples above have all already been preprocessed. When you try to view an image for the first time it has to be fetched from commons and transformed into a zoomable image. This has to be done only once for each image (the result is then cached). The preprocessing can take up to 2 minutes. A status is displayed along with a little spinner. In some cases (for very large images) a page reload can be necessary. For even larger images the preprocessing program may exceed allowed memory consumption on the toolserver. I can then add the images manually (I might run a bot to process all of the largest images on commons). I would like to use the opportunity to thank the toolserver admins for their swift help finding bugs, installing software and giving programming advice! --Dschwen\n\nA very nice gadget, I must admit. I'll definitely keep it enabled and I'm sure other users will like it as well. Thank you.. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nReally nice. But I got it to work only on the photos listed above. Enabling the gadget and using it on random (ordinary-sized) jpegs , I always get a \"Not a valid JPG file!\" message (both for the Flash and the JS versions), immediately after a message \"Obtaining image data from Commons...\". The same also when reloading after waiting a couple of minutes. No idea of what's happening. -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nShit. I know why, one second. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nUgh, some bowser cache confusion, feeding my 1yo, deleting my script(!) and rewriting it from an old backup, I think it is working again. If not please make absolutely sure your browser caches are cleared and tell me the name of the file that is not working. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nWorks perfectly now, thanks! -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nVery nice! A back link to the commons page would be fine, especially for the license information and image description. --Kolossos (talk)\n\nI know. I'm tying to find out how to best implement it. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nNice work anyway - thanks --Herby talk thyme\n\nGreat tool. BTW The gadget for zooming seems to interfere with the one for tineye. -- User:Docu at , updated: 20:41, 22 March 2010 (UTC)\n\nI tried it, seems great. For those who understand french, you can test its usefullness on this game (ie try to find the woman's legs on File:Arbre du prince Jean Luxembourg 2009 04.jpg). --GaAs11671\n\nJust in case someone noticed. The processing of new images was broken for the last 24(?) hours, as a toolserver software upgrade made a recompilation of one of the processing tools necessary. It is now fully working again. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nI uploaded a picture (File:Peterborough Cathedral March 2010.jpg) then viewed it in the ZoomViewer. 24 hours later I uploaded an updated version over the top of my first picture. A week after my second upload, when I use ZoomViewer, I still see the first version. Is there a way to force the ZoomViewer to use the new image? Seems like a 'Purge' button would be useful. NotFromUtrecht (talk)\n\nYes, that would be useful, or detection if a new version was uploaded. I'll work on that. --Dschwen (talk)\n\nVector skin currently doesn't show the Catscan link. Is there a way to add it to MediaWiki:Extra-tabs.js? -- User:Docu at\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, CatScan is shown when viewing a category page. -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nYes, it is on\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Wikimedia_Usability_Initiative&useskin=monobook\n\nbut it's missing on:\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Wikimedia_Usability_Initiative&useskin=vector\n\nunless it's hidden somwhere. -- User:Docu at\n\nThe little arrow to the right of the \"star\" button (which watchlists the page). When your mouse hovers over it, it shows all the extra tabs that would be displayed in monobook skin (catscan is in there). Vector is evil. :-) Killiondude (talk)\n\nI have no \"little arrow\". No way to find it. I suppose it is the same for Docu. (But I like vector) --GaAs11671\n\nThe little arrow is visible in some other namespaces (e.g. \"User talk:\"), but not \"Category:\". Even de-activating all gadgets doesn't change it. -- User:Docu at\n\nI see the \"little arrow\" in the link you provided above, which is in the category namespace. FWIW, I use Firefox 3.5. Killiondude (talk)\n\nMay be yo have it because as an administrator you have additionnal menus (such as \"delete\"). I have it on user: and user_talk:, on Commons talk:Village pump (which I can rename) but *not* on Commons:Village pump (is there some sort of protection ? I have the menu whith \"rename\" on Commons:Bistro) and *not* on file:.\n\nI would say, the menu appears only if there something to put in it, and \"catscan\" is not counted as something when making this test.\n\n--GaAs11671\n\nConfirmed for Village pump: done archiving [move=sysop]. So with vector non-admin have the \"arrow-menu\" only for pages they have the right to rename. --GaAs11671\n\nI listed this for the usability team at Commons:Usability_issues_and_ideas#Vector_skin_on_Commons. -- User:Docu at\n\nCatrope, the Uer Experience Software Developer is looking into how to make CatScan visible in Vector for non-admins. Hopefully, we can restore it soon. --Shuhari (talk)\n\nRelated question: in the vector skin, is there a way to define custom drop-down lists? -- User:Docu at\n\nOnce upon a time, I did things like that. But it was long, long, time ago. Since then, they have been happy and have had a lot of children. --GaAs11671\n\nSeveral tools currently add themselves to the toolbox or as additional tabs. It might look tidier of these were add to separate menus instead. That way they could have grand-children too ;) -- User:Docu at\n\nI have fixed MediaWiki:Extra-tabs.js so it now adds tabs outside the dropdown, to the left of the watch star (not doing that results in border weirdness) and wrapped in <span> tags (not doing that results in a too large font size and other ugliness). On non-Vector-like skins (all other skins at this point) these rules are ignored, except for the span-wrapping (which is harmless in other skins).\n\nThis means tabs added by JavaScript using MediaWiki:Extra-tabs.js should now display the way you presumably expect them to (you may need to purge your browser cache before this fix takes effect). Tabs added by extensions may still defy your expectations; this will have to be fixed in the extensions themselves. --Catrope (talk)\n\nWorks for me. The fix made all other tabs appear too. Thanks for taking the time to look into this. A minor thing that is missing are the \"Gallery, Orphans, Untagged\" tabs on Special:Contributions/Catrope, but I don't mind. -- User:Docu at 17:12, 2010 April 5\n\nMarch 24\n\nI suppose PLURAL using default behaviour (English). Why isn't it switched depending on the language set in user settings? Wizardist (talk)\n\nWizardist, I have no idea what you are trying to say. Could you try wording this differently, or (if necessary to make yourself clear) saying it in a different language? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nHe's speaking about the parser function {{PLURAL:...}} which is used in message localization. It's always set to the wiki default language. The problem is: Mediawiki is designed for monolingual wikis and although multilingual wikis like Meta and Commons exist since many years there never was any effort to provide real multilingual support.\n\nThe best solution would be to allow to specify the wanted language as a parameter. Language set in user options is no good solution because that would also apply to messages in different languages.\n\nChances are low that the developers will improve this anytime soon. But it would be possible to reimplement the plural functionality in a template. --Slomox (talk)\n\nI created {{Plural}}. It takes the same parameters as the parser function plus an additional lang parameter to specify the language. At the moment it supports the English, French and Czech behaviour. Other languages can be added too. The information about plural behaviour can be found in the language files at http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/languages/classes/ --Slomox (talk)\n\nCould you possibly add an explanation of {{Plural}} on its talk page, or somewhere appropriate? The parameters are totally obscure. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI added some documentation, and also a rule for Russian and some other related languages. There's still a whole bunch of languages with odd plural rules that need implementing, though. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nI have doubts about that. I don't want to be classified as a deletionist (I'm not, imho). But very often I see files whith a very questionnable {{Own}}, and in most cases I pretend having seen nothing, as it is more comfortable (I fear potentially induced problems as a pest).\n\nDo you think I should click on the \"nominate for deletion\" link, even if I am not convinced? --GaAs11671\n\nI should say: If you are not convinced, no, but if you have serious doubt and want community opinion, yes.--Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nTo be factual, here are some examples:\n\nFile:Red winged wren MR walk 3 email.jpg (viewing uploader talk page, I would delete, but it is on ::fr: main page today, so... I've seen nothing -- oops, I edited this page...).\n\nFile:Catskull.jpg: an image of this quality, for a material supposed to be only available to scientific people working on the the subject...\n\nFile:Allawi3.jpg link to source is dead. No author.\n\nand many others.\n\nI've said it: I'm not sure. The question is: would it be considered as \"disorganizing\" Commons if I nominated such files for deletion?\n\n--GaAs11671\n\nChecking the talk page for previous warnings should be done with care. It may serve as an antecedent only with obvious copyvios, such as CD covers, videogame screenshots, movie posters, etc. Sometimes an image is deleted after a DR where highly complex legal or technical topics have been discussed, such as whenever freedom of panorama applies, if a work falls within a type of work as defined at X law or not, etc. Even if the image ends deleted, we wouldn't be able to say that the uploader uploaded a copyright violation on purpose, or that all his other uploads may be likely to be copyright violations Belgrano (talk)\n\nYou are right about the antecedents of users. I now think the best way to handle that is to pretend you never saw the problem. I'll apply this policy from now. Thanks for this answer. --GaAs11671\n\nThat's not what I said. The antecedents of the user are just one of the things that may be considered. If there is some other compeling reason to believe a work is an unlikely own work (for example, a satellite photo), then you should point so. If you can't come up with such a reason, then you should leave it. But in any case, this is my opinion, not a written policy. Your opinion is as much valuable as mine. Belgrano (talk)\n\nThat's not what you said, of course. But that's what I'll do. And the funny thing is no-one will ever be able to prove the things I didn't do, as if I don't do it there is no evidence I should have done it --GaAs11671\n\nI think in case of vague doubts you should perform reasonable research before DR, and in my opinion in this case your research wasn't deep enough. For example, before DR because of broken link you should (in my opinion, only in my opinion) try to fix this link -- external links brokes all the time, and in this case it was very easy to fix it using Internet Archive. If you doubt own work claim because of some number of deleted user uploads, you should check why these uploads have been deleted. Trycatch (talk)\n\nI think I should maintain a list of files I didn't resquest for deletion -- not public, of course! --GaAs11671\n\nYou sound delightful. Killiondude (talk)\n\nI sometimes leave a murmur of doubt on the talk page of the uploaded file. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\n+1 like P. Kuiper: better to use the discussion page. the file with the catskull: this user had uploaded several similar images - it is not impossible that there are really scientists and non-dilettants that upload images..... - but if it is taken from a scientific collection , he should make a reference to it, thats true. Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nIf they look valuable to me, I try a lot more to avoid DR. If the images look pretty useless, then I don't hesitate very long. Amada44 (talk)\n\nComment - very nice examples to illustrate useless and \"out of scope\" files - but quite different from the problem of user:GaAs Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nwell, what you are saying is partly true ;-) The seleced images are not the best ones to make my point. What I ment was, that if a image is very good, I will try to find the source or whatever it needs so it can stay (or I'll even create new files). If they are not bad quality and doutful --> off they go to the trash. So depending on the quality of doughtful images I spend more or less time in looking into the matter. Amada44 (talk)\n\nCommons does seem to lack a convenient place to ask for second or third opinions on doubtful files — as far as the official processes go, you can either request deletion or do nothing at all. And even deletion requests don't always receive as much attention as they'd deserve. Of course, it's always possible to bring up issues on the file's talk page (if anyone happens to look there), on the uploader's user talk page (if they're active), at Commons talk:Licensing (for some issues) or here at the village pump (which works, but makes the place even more noisy), but all these alternatives have their disadvantages as I've noted. (Also, if its your own file you'd like to request a second opinion on, the first two options are pretty much out anyway.)\n\nIt might be a good idea to start a page like Commons:Media review for that purpose, in more or less the same format as the village pump. Or, alternatively, we could just encourage people to bring up such issues here, and possibly later spin them off to a separate page if and when they start taking up too much space here. In fact, I'll hereby recommend that we do just that. Any objections? —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nBoth Commons talk:Licensing and/or Commons talk:PD files (if the picture is licenced as PD) are good places to talk about your doubts. Teofilo (talk)\n\nMon sentiment est que ces pages sont réservées à des cas génériques (généralisables). But I take note that you encourage me to use theese pages, donc je le ferai. --GaAs11671\n\nI've seen both of those pages used to discuss individual files, at least when the questions pertain to the subject of the page (i.e. \"Is this file really PD?\" or \"Is the license for this file valid?\"). Still, it's not really their main purpose, and in any case those subjects would still seem to exclude some potential sources of doubt, such as the ones in your examples above (\"Is this file adequately sourced?\" or \"Does this really look like a self-made work?\") as well as others (like \"Does this count as a derivative work?\" or \"Is this really in scope for Commons?\"). Of course, some of those could probably be productively asked on other Commons talk pages, like Commons talk:Derivative works or Commons talk:Project scope, but it does seem to me that a single place for all such questions (and others I didn't think of right now) might perhaps not be a bad thing to have. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nDo you know the verb plussoyer? Je plussoie, we should have a page to discuss such \"I doubt but I'm no sure\" things. Sorry for having used French. Now I have to speak serbian. --GaAs11671\n\nAn alternative may be to reformulate the question, from \"is this image valid\" to \"are images with some X detail or circumstance valid\"? For example, we may safely say that all images that despict a president talking with his ministers or other politicians inside the government house would never be real \"own works\", either another licence applies (such as {{PD-USGov}}) or it's a copyright violation Belgrano (talk)\n\n\"Never\" can be quite a strong word, though. Don't we have some contributors with press credentials? I thought we did... —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nMarch 31\n\nDo images like this and this really have to be deleted??? Who would claim copyright?? Amada44 (talk)\n\nYes they do; see COM:PRP. Stifle (talk)\n\nThe 2nd one is a special case (used via a template more than 2000 times) that I mentionned on Commons:Deletion requests/File:Metro porte Dauphine (1).jpg. --GaAs11671\n\nis the building itself protected by copyright? Amada44 (talk)\n\nYes, until 2013-01-01. All we can do is what I wrote on the 1rst DR: « Just make this discussion last for 33 month ». --GaAs11671\n\nin my opinion it is a caricature of the duties of an archive like this, if everybody can upload files like these, they are used for 1.5 years, and then somebody is just finding out (correctly) that they are copyright violations and they are deleted according to the law. If we want to implement a \"precautionary principle\" the proof that there is no copy violation must be done at the beginning - and has to be approved in a space before the real upload. (As far as I understand the German Wikipedia implements a \"Dateiüberprüfung\" - but I am far away from saying that the German WP is better than others.) The consequences would be a drastically reduced growth, but a better quality (at least for copyright violations) Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nCommons ought to adopt the policy suggested by Mike Godwin in Commons:Deletion requests/File:2004 Landmark v Ross answer.pdf - just wait for a take-down notice. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nIt could be a good idea. For example, for buildings FOP in France, we know the few architects which are problematic (beginning by this one), just ban these one, for the remaining 99% they have never said anything. --GaAs11671\n\nI would support that! Amada44 (talk)\n\n@Pieter, with that strategy we would expose the re-users to litigation. Mike Godwin is in a somewhat comfortable position as institutions in other countries than the US are unlikely to sue Wikimedia. Would he say the same if it is about let's say, Corbis or Getty Images? --Túrelio (talk)\n\nOf course Commons should not host images that are likely to invite take-down notices. But most of the discussions here are about stuff like anonymous WWI photos or photos of office building in Romania. Commons needs a more sensible approach to copyright. And it should give better service to the wikipedias, allowing images that will never cause problems in the context of an article. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nThat could be an interesting alternative. The copyright laws, how well intended they might be, protect very well the very famous artists (0,001 % ?) but block the spreading of the works from 99,999 %, the bulk of them. --Foroa (talk)\n\nThis is the same issue I raised earlier. Here's another fine image at risk There are no legal implications, it's purely a matter of the policy agreed by the commons community. In a very similar case the community voted 54 to 7 to create an exception to our policy that one category of images need to be public domain both in U.S. and country of origin. I suggest we should try to get a similar exception for buildings. 9carney (talk)\n\nAccording this:http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Pe-8.jpg In fact, the copyright of this photo does not belong to Russia, the photo captured Commissar Molotov's arrival in England at 1942, and this picture made by English photographer.\n\nSecond photo taken photographer NII VVS during flight tests and formally belongs to the Rus. Fed. Defense Ministry. But not once in the history RFDM not require royalties for documents belonging to them are in the archives. For second photo normally working \"70year cap\" license. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Dlinevitch (talk • contribs)\n\nThis probably belongs at Commons:Deletion requests/File:Pe-8.jpg. I've copied it there. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nWe should not delete files before ensuring the derivatives are correctly described. I don't say that for anyone in particular, it's just such cases are not so rare:\n\nsr:Слика:DemoBIH2006.PNG (original or not?) (deleted 2007-01 because transfered to Commons?)\n\nen:File:DemoBIH2006.PNG (copied from #1 no author and no original source given) (deleted 2006-12 because transfered to Commons)\n\nFile:DemoBIH2006.PNG (copied from #2) (deleted 2008-06 because duplicate of #4)\n\nFile:DemoBIH2006a.png (derivative from #2) (DR in 2010-03 because no source)\n\nThat's sure, after such a life, the image of today has no initial author, no clear sources, no traceability of the license. So it should be deleted?\n\nOK, I'll try to contact admins at sr: but what a loss of time... --GaAs11671\n\nDo you think that making a merge of history of description pages would be a useful thing? --GaAs11671\n\nHmm, yes, it could be. I think it would require an adminbot to implement, though (if I understand what you're suggesting correctly). Also, it still wouldn't help with files manually copied between wikis; for example in this case, even if the person who moved the image from en.wikipedia had used such a tool, the transferred description page would only have contained the description from that wiki, which only said (I just checked, I'm an admin there):\n\nTaken from Serbian Wikipedia, the [[Republika Srpska]] article. It was created by a Serbian user based on various statistical data. There are some inaccuracies in the map (borders of Brčko district, etc.)\n\nI can't really think of any way to make an automatic tool smart enough to track down the actual source based on that. (Well, actually I can, sort of, but it would probably have a huge error rate.) A human could've done it, but obviously neither the user who moved the image to Commons nor either of the admins who deleted the local copies actually did. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nWhen I upload a picture via classic upload form (I use this, it is much more reliable than commonist) every time I press \"upload\" button == Summary == == Summary == is inserted to the file description. I have found no way how to block it. Check my contributions, you can see details of this problems. Can you help me to fix this? It is quite annoying. Thanks. --Aktron (talk)\n\nMaybe your text has == Summary == prepended? I know that the basic upload form automatically does this for you.

See COM:FAQ#Why is the text of my new uploads corrected soon after upload? and the section just one below that one. BTW, the correct change would use \"{{int:license-header}}\".

I was using the Upload file link on the left hand side. There I decided to chose the option US governmental source or something like that. Then I filled the open fields. That was all. --A.Ceta (talk)\n\nHello everybody.\n\nHubblesite.org has changed his copyright policies (move to CC by). I've changed this template. --ComputerHotline (talk)\n\nCannot change from PD to a more restrictive license. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nAnd where did you see they changed their license? [2] still says PD. Only spacetelescope.org changed their license some time ago, but it's not retroactive, and we already have {{Cc-Hubble}} for that. I've reverted because in any case we should not relicense the images that we got under PD. –Tryphon☂\n\nHere--ComputerHotline (talk) .\n\nThat's Spacetelescope, not Hubblesite...I see no mention of Hubblesite having changed their license on the link you gave. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nIndeed. That license change happened several months ago, but has no influence on images hosted at hubblesite.org (in fact, if an image is hosted on both sites, we can choose the less restrictive license and tag it with {{PD-Hubble}}). On top of that, it is almost never appropriate to modify an existing license template to change its license terms; free licenses cannot be revoked, so no matter what license change happens now, the images we already have continue being PD. –Tryphon☂\n\nHow small subjects is it reasonable to divide into categories by year? Category:Bertil Ohlin with four imges was divided like that. I think that was clearly not useful, so I put the images back in the main category. That means the images are now overcategorised, but I think that is better than having to look in three different categories to see all four images. For larger subjects with hundreds or thousands of images I can see tha such subdivision can be useful (as long as it is not the only division). /Ö\n\nAnother question is what should be in the countries by year categories. They can be strictly geographical for images taken in the country, or they can be wider and include all images related the country. For example should Nikita Khrushchev in 1964 be in 1964 in the Soviet Union because Khrushchev was from the Soviet Union, even if currently all images in the category are taken in Sweden? Or not in any by country category, since people can travel and are not always in the same country for a whole year? Should an image of a japanese singer in Sweden be categorised \"in Japan\" just because the singer is from Japan? /Ö\n\nAs you can read, it was a Swedish TV show (Hylands hörna) which broadcasted live from Tokyo, Japan just that day, because of the 1964 Olympic Summer Games in that town. I added Sweden too since the show was aimed to Sweden. J 1982 (talk)\n\nIt is very annoying to see categories fragmented like this. And for many images, the year is not important. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nI think indeed that we are heading towards significant fragmentation problems if we don't find solutions for the real \"overcategorization\" problem: too many/deep specialists subcategories makes it very hard to categorise and find items for non specialists or when no precise criteria (such as date) are available. If for example, one categorises some windmills in a separate specialised postmills category, few people will be able to find and categorise \"generic\" windmills in that structure. I think that it is time to introduce some concept of specialist or side-categories that allow to avoid the \"overcategorization\" mantra. --Foroa (talk)\n\nUser refuses to discuss, just goes on and on. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nYear is important. Some people like to think, when watchin a town, \"-That's how it looked in 1997, and that's in 2004\". They think of what has changed, and what has not. J 1982 (talk)\n\nFrom your user name it is clear that you think so. But users generally want images of a place. Things do not change by year. Fragmenting the images that we have of Cracow in Category:Kraków by decade is not a good idea. If a town-category gets overpopulated, it should be diffused by neighbourhood, or by building. Not primarily by decade, be year, or by month. But diffusing by neighboorhood requires some local knowledge. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nMore fragmentation in Category:18th-century architecture in Sweden. Putting a definite year on a church is a bit arbitrary: when did the architect make the drawings, what was the date on the \"first stone\", when was the building consacrated? That is a span a several years. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nIf it is a subject I can take a picture on any moment, it shouldnt be categorised by time. But I have uploaded historical pictures where is usefull. example Category:1982 in rail transport. It is a usefull snapshot at wat was going on in 1982. But is not useful to create a subcategory rail/country/year as the images are already categorised by the normal technical and geografic categories. Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nAgree completely. I don't see any value to adding specific date categories on a historic building or other subject which has looked the same for a long time. Doing so will clutter those categories and make them less useful for finding events which really are tied to a date.

But, copyright transfer rules were ambiguous before 1978, and the owner may have a claim. Pretty fuzzy though. Seems pretty extreme for a DR. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nMarch 30\n\nAs far as I'm aware, I don't believe there are any guidelines or proposals regarding the positioning of superseded templates (e.g. {{Vva}}) within file pages. Common locations of the template placements include underneath the license template (ex), below the information template (ex), or prepended above the page (ex). In my opinion, having these templates scattered around the file page makes it less convenient for people, especially graphists, to locate. We have forgotten all about the \"other versions=\" parameter of the {{Information}} template. Nowadays, I place the superseded template in the \"other versions\" parameter and it seems to work fine and keeps the page well organized IMO (ex). With the exception of file pages lacking the information template, I propose that superseded templates are placed in that parameter to keep file pages consistent. A bot script could be requested to do this job should this proposal come to an agreement. ZooFari\n\nI think it would be better if people could just easily program their preferred order via a script. Other people might not care for such templates in the \"other versions\" cell. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\n\"Other versions\" seems to be place to recommend if one wants to know where to place them.

Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nEdRoberts1975.jpg is licensed as public domain no notice. The publication date is given as 1975. A careful reading of the source[3] shows the photo was taken at the \"Personal Computer Pioneers Day\" held on June 14, 1986 and published by The Computer Museum of Boston in the Fall of 1986. (The collection of this museum was transferred to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View CA.} The uploader, Night Ranger agrees the image should be deleted.[4] -- Swtpc6800 (talk)\n\nCopyright notices were required before March 1, 1989... but if there is no evidence for the lack of notice on the actual publication of that era, better to delete. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI have put a copyvio tag on the image and left a note on Night Ranger talk page. -- Swtpc6800 (talk)\n\nI admit that the question is not 100% accurate but I use that wording to make the point that in the great majority of jurisdictions, including the one in which Wikimedia's servers are located, photographing a building has no more legal implications than photographing a sunset - the only copyright which exists belongs to the photographer. Whatever copyright exists in the architect's plans or the constructed building is irrelevant.\n\nWe all know that there are a few countries where this is not the case, and while we should generally respect other countries copyright law as best we can, that surely need not include cases where there is something particularly strange about the copyright situation in those countries (wording pirated from Jimbo).\n\nAs Wikimedia's servers are located in the US, the images we host must obey the relevant US law, everything else is a matter of policy and if the current policy doesn't fit the aims of the project then the policy should be changed.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundations's approved definition of \"Free Cultural Works\" can be summarised as \"work which is free from copyright-like restriction anywhere\"\n\nI'm sure that it was never the intention to exclude works which fail the \"anywhere\" test just because of a few legal quirks in a handful of countries. I feel that \"almost anywhere\" is free enough in this case for the purposes of this project.\n\nThe Commons community previously approved one exception where copyright laws are inconsistent between countries.\n\nI feel that a similar exception for images of buildings would be in keeping with the principles of the project. What do you think? 9carney (talk)\n\nOne problem is not quirky laws, but short laws. If the law of United Emirates does not have a clause exempting photos of architecture, commons is going on these deletion sprees. Whatever the actual case law or common practice on the ground (except for the case of Israel). /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\n« As Wikimedia's servers are located in the US » is not relevant, as most users here are not from the United States. And more, the objective of Mediawiki is to bring knowledge to every people in the world, 95% of them being outside of US. Please, remember. --GaAs11671\n\nGaAs, that's not true (about the server location being irrelevant). Take a look at COM:L#Interaction of United States copyright law and non-US copyright law. Killiondude (talk)\n\nAnd the objective of MediaWiki is to create wiki software to run Wikimedia projects. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nI am also strictly against the deletionism of Non-FOP-pictures. We should ask Wikimedia Foundation if they would accept a rule that only US-FOP counts here. Then we can make a poll if we want this. We can change our policies like any other project and I think the FOP case is the most important case of policy change --Histo (talk)\n\n\"...that only US-FOP counts here...\" What about sculptures? Lupo\n\nThe law is the law. We follow it until something changes. Blurpeace\n\nThe the legal position is very clear. No laws need to change to allow us to host these images, only our own policy. 9carney (talk)\n\nYou are correct that it is not a matter of legality -- photos of buildings should be completely fine (well, provided the photo is licensed) in the United States, and even photos of statues should almost always be fair use on Wikimedia projects anyways. It is a bit more than Commons policy though -- it is Wikimedia Foundation policy as well, which also runs in to the projects which use them -- we want images to be \"free\", a definition based around copyright and all its technicalities, and additionally the Foundation has specified that Commons cannot keep images under fair use rationales. While I don't like deletions based on theoretical reasoning -- if nobody has ever lost a court case over a particular type of image or derivative work, we should keep them -- these are a bit different, as there are a number of (successful) court cases over images of this type, in the U.S. and elsewhere (including photos of buildings), so there are definite copyright-related issues with them. It is definitely frustrating, and perhaps we need some sort of intermediate photo database (\"as free as we can get\" photos of copyrighted objects, which wikipedias realistically need photos for). But there are definite philosophic issues which go beyond Commons policy alone. But if the Foundation is amenable for keeping all photos of buildings (arguably OK under U.S. law), that could be an approach. That is probably more problematic than the PD-Art decision though. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nCarl has expressed my thoughts on the matter (I wasn't looking to make a lengthy statement). Wikimedia Commons attempts to collect a database of works free, in a sense, \"worldwide\". What you are suggesting bypasses law in the source country for ours. We can't just make exceptions for specific countries while we don't for others. Blurpeace\n\nThe Foundation's lawyer consistently tells us that Commons ought to relax policy, most recently here. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nIt might be possible to relax the policy, mark the image with a warning that it might not be free for all use everywhere, and delete images where there is a genuine objection. Such a policy would in effect focus more on the use of pictures on Commons from those who are currently using pictures from here (Wikipedia etc.), rather than on the use by some hypothetical future user from outside the Wikimedia projects. It might then be that pictures of buildings in France could only be used in the non-French Wikipedias, and so on, but it would still serve the primary users of Commons better than the current policy. It is the case already that not all ways of reuse of pictures are possible, this would only extend that to another area. A warning on the picture page might be in useful in these cases.\n\nSuch a relaxation of the policy might lead to a situation where a newspaper in India could find a picture of a building in France for illustrating a news-item, a student might use the picture for his thesis, but someone who were looking to publish a book on the architect might not be able to use it. The latter I think would anyway want to have his own pictures taken. I would support such a relaxation of the policy, and would myself have at least one photo of an interesting modern building in Italy to upload. Haros (talk)\n\nThat's precisely what commons voted for in respect of photos of old paintings: Create an exception to our licensing policy and add a warning for the images in question. I believe it would equally serve the goals of this project to do the same for buildings. 9carney (talk)\n\nYes, but that came due to a Foundation belief (backed up by U.S. law, and likely in most countries, and even in the U.K. there has not been an explicit courtroom test of the theory that they may be copyrightable there) that straight-on photos of PD paintings should be considered as copies, and should be free. That did not extend to ignoring a still-valid copyright on the underlying work itself. It is a bit different situation, and we would probably prefer to have a similar philosophical statement from the Foundation, rather than a practical, legal one (since the problems are primarily with the philosophical issue of what is \"free\", which we are mandated to follow). Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nCarl Lindberg, you mentioned a number of court cases, do you know of any in the US courts regarding photos of buildings? I know the designer of the w:Atomium sent a take down notice to a US website but it did not seem to have led to a court case. Reading w:Copyright in architecture in the United States suggests that it was a textbook example of w:copyfraud. 9carney (talk)\n\nThe building court cases were in other countries (one in Germany that I know of, and I think a couple in France). Photos of buildings in the U.S. are basically always OK. Buildings completed prior to 1990 were not copyrightable in the first place in the U.S., and the current law explicitly limits the derivative rights of the architectural copyright so to not extend to photographs of the buildings, so they are not (in the eyes of the law) derivative works. There is no such limitation mentioned for sculpture though, and there have been a number of court cases on those (not consistently decided, but plenty enough to presume there is a real issue). The Atomium really isn't a building; I would guess it would be considered a sculpture. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nI read, half a dozen years or so, that a new pastime was to google one's self, to see how famous you were. Last night I did that -- not outo of vanity, but because another wikipedia contributor was complaining that some of my pages of notes, in my wikipedia User space were showing up on his google searches, and he wanted me to place __NOINDEX__ on them.\n\nMy google search turned up an image, republished elsewhere, that was being credited to me.\n\nI think it is a sign that an online publication had turned to the commons for public domain images, had intended to credit the actual photographer, and had credited the uploader by mistake. The image was still in google's cache, but the actual article was 404.\n\nI welcome opinions, on what obligation, if any, I have to try to clarify the record.\n\nI wonder whether there is some step we should take to further clarify that the uploader is not necessarily the photographer?\n\nCheers! Geo Swan (talk)\n\nPerhaps usage of {{Credit line}} should be furtherly encouraged. IMHO, it could be helpful to extend the upload forms with a further textfield for it. -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nI was not familiar with {{Credit line}}. I just looked at the documentation, and I have a couple of questions:\n\nThe {{Credit line}} template's author field and the {{Information}} template's author field have different purposes -- when would these fields have different values? If they don't have different purposes would it be possible to require uploaders to use just one author field?\n\nThe documentations says all the fields are optional. So, when used with no fields filled the template is a no-op?\n\nIs it a good idea or a bad ida to use it thus: {{Credit line | Author = ~~~ | License= {{cc-by-sa}} }}\n\nCheers! Geo Swan (talk)\n\nWell, {{Credit line}} is meant to display the text that should be used verbatim in attributing the work, which may not be the same as the author's name, or not limited to the author's name. See for example File:6 Warszawa Natolin 122.jpg, where the credit line includes also a title of the photo set.\n\nFor your second question: a {{Credit line}} without parameters isn't really that useful, but it's not a no-op, since it still expands to a row of a wikitable with a heading. Perhaps it should emit a warning in this case.\n\nFinally, {{Credit line | Author = ~~~ | License= {{cc-by-sa}} }} is not a good idea, for two reasons: first, license tags such as {{cc-by-sa}} expand to large info boxes which should be integrally be reported in printed publications, whereas the license name (and a link) should be enough; secondarily, ~~~ expands to a full signature including the talkback link, which is meaningless in printed publications. Personally, I think of {{Credit line}} as a one-liner that could be used also outside the web (i.e. on printed media). -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nNote that a credit line can be speficied within the CC templates, such as in File:Quartz-22021.jpg. Jean-Fred (talk)\n\nYeah, you should use the Creative Commons attribution option. {{Credit line}} was probably created by people who didn't know that the attribution option existed. Multichill (talk)\n\nAll instances of {{Credit line}} should be replaced by updated Creative Commons templates and than nuked. Multichill (talk)\n\nTemplate:Credit line and Commons:Credit line were created as a result of a long discussion on VP (here) after proposal to create a single uniform place where reusers can find info on how to attribute the image, in the form similar to other image repositories. At the time of its creation there was no attribution option which was added only few months ago to templates like {{Self}} or {{Cc-by-sa-3.0}}. I still think all images should explicitly spell out how they should be attributed in order to help reusers comply with the license, and that such attributions would be easier to find in the {{Information}} template, but I do like the fact that placement in the license templates couples it more tightly with the license. So in the end I do not care where attribution string will be displayed. One problem I have with the current use of the attribution parameter is that it is often misused. For example File:Fotothek df n-06 0000274.jpg uses attribution \"Deutsche Fotothek‎\" but without mention of the author or the license, we seems to be encouraging breaking the license by improper attribution (see Commons:Credit line or the license itself for required form of attribution). --Jarekt (talk)\n\nApril 4\n\nA very valuable book - but it is a copyright violation, isnt it? (Or is there a license to copy the books of the Cambridge University Press? :) Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nfrom the same user: Henri Bergson with a NASA Licence, see File:Essaisurlesdonn00berguoft.djvu - sorry for these stupid questions, but this is very strange for me. Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nThe book on Hume looks like a blatant copyright violation to me – it was first published in 1993. What is more, the uploader filled in the information template with \"test\". As for the Bergson work, the NASA licence is clearly spurious. Bergson died on 4 January 1941, so if copyright runs for 70 years from the year of his death (see \"Commons:Licensing#France\"), the work will enter the public domain at the start of 2012. However, there seems to be a possibility of a copyright extension due to World War II: see \"Commons:Licensing#Wartime copyright extensions\", which is a little hard to understand. In summary, both of the uploads are currently still copyrighted and should be nominated for deletion, and the uploader should be advised not to upload such works. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nFile:The Hume.djvu is a blatant copyright violation, in the U.S. and basically everywhere else. That should be speedy deleted. File:Essaisurlesdonn00berguoft.djvu was published in 1889, so it is PD in the U.S. (and thus can legitimately appear on Internet Archive, the claimed source), but if the French author died in 1941, then it is still copyrighted there until 2012, and it should be deleted. (The wartime extensions are mostly moot; that section needs to be updated -- pretty sure the French courts ruled they didn't get the extension from 70 years but rather the 50 p.m.a. term, so only if a work originally has the 30-year extension for having \"died in the service of France\" could the term be higher than 70 p.m.a.[5]). I can't fathom how the NASA license would apply. File:Treatiseofhumann01humeuoft.djvu, by the same uploader, is also a slight issue -- while the bulk is a reprint of Hume's 1700s work, and that volume itself appears that it was first published in 1888 in Great Britain (though that is a later reprint) and thus PD in the U.S., there is a forward by the editor Sir Lewis Amherst Selby-Bigge (1860-1951) and that bit would appear to still be under copyright. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nRegarding \"Treatiseofhumann01humeuoft.djvu\": perhaps a version with the foreword removed (and a note explaining why) can be uploaded? I'm not sure how to edit djvu files. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nBoth are zapped. Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nThanks to all - I learn that \"zapped\" means \"deleted\". :) Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nI am working with a professional photographer who is willing to release a cropped low resolution (200 x 300) portrait for a Wikipedia biography. This would be under a Creative Commons license that requires attribution. Is a CC-BY-SA-3.0 required or is the CC-BY-3.0 suitable? Would the released image be limited to the low resolution copy? This image has been published full page in a book and we don't want that high resolution image to be released. (Added missing word \"we don't want\". Swtpc6800 (talk) )\n\nI have uploaded hundreds of public domain images but never one with licensing. -- Swtpc6800 (talk)\n\nI would recommend the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license because it requires that future uses of the image also are released under the same Creative Commons license, but CC-BY-3.0 is also accepted on Commons. The photographer is perfectly within their rights to only release a low-resolution version with a Creative Commons license, but I'm sure we would love to have a higher resolution if they are willing. Killiondude (talk)\n\nTo reassure the photographer, no, (s)he wouldn't be releasing the high-res version. The only way people could get a copy would be by a) committing a crime b) asking the photographer or c) taking the low-res version and attempting to upscale it. Incidentally, 200x300 is nowhere near useful on a professional level - you could easily go up to 1000x1500 and still be sure that the newspapers would have to come to you for a full-res version for printing. Jarry1250 (talk)\n\nCC-BY-SA is more restrictive than CC-BY; we accept both, so whichever the author wants. Yes, you can limit the license to the lower-resolution version only -- that is its own \"work\". You can't prevent someone from taking that version and upscaling it, or making other derivative works based on that particular version, but it would still be a copyright violation to use any other higher-resolution version without permission from the photographer. It would be a good idea to make that condition explicit in the permission section of the image description, to reduce the chance of someone incorrectly assuming they can use any version at all. And since this image has been published elsewhere, we generally require that an email from the photographer be sent to OTRS (see the link for the email address and sample content), so that it is not deleted under the assumption someone just made a copy and uploaded it without permission (which happens all too frequently), and would provide additional evidence for the resolution limitation. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nHi all. I just screwed up when entering the title of a photography.\n\nImage:File:French colony 10 francs Banque centrale afrique de l'ouest 1064 (A).jpg\n\nis supposed to be\n\nFile:French colony 10 francs Banque centrale afrique de l'ouest 1964 (A).jpg\n\nI don't see any button to rename so I thought I should ask somebody here. Thanks Philippe Giabbanelli (talk)\n\nThe fastest way is to upload the image again under the correct name, and tag the wrongly named image with {{Badname}} to have it deleted speedily. Alternatively, you can add the {{Rename}} template to the image description page (click on the template name for instructions on how to use it), but it takes a bit of time for an administrator get around to renaming files. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThanks. The instructions of rename are pretty self-explanatory. I used this template since I don't see any reason to hurry about that coin (it's obvious anyway that it's not from the 11th century or else they were a lot better back then than I thought). Cheers Philippe Giabbanelli (talk)\n\nIn the last few days i've been improving Commons' support for the Hebrew language.\n\nI translated many templates and messages, but there's one problem which i don't know how to solve: The right-to-left directionality of the upload form.\n\nFor example, look at http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&uselang=he . The explanations at the top, which come from MediaWiki:Uploadtext/he are displayed correctly, but the form itself is jumbled. The labels appear to the left of the input boxes, which is ugly and unintuitive in a right-to-left environment. The colons (:) appear sometimes to the right of the label and sometimes to the left. The question mark icons near the checkboxes after the gray categories field appear incorrectly.\n\nAll the above is also true for:\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&uselang=heownwork\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&uselang=hefromwikimedia\n\netc.\n\nThis problem also pertains to Arabic and Farsi and probably to all other right-to-left languages.\n\nAny help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance. --Amir E. Aharoni (talk)\n\nWell, with \"&uselang=he\", the form looks good for me in the monobook skin. Labels are on the right, colons on their left, the fields are on the left. For \"&uselng=heownwork\" and other uselang-hacked forms, the forms indeed do look jumbled. It also looks jumbled in other skins, like vector.\n\nWe could probably fix most this in the monobook skin by creating MediaWiki:Monobook.js/heownwork and so on, based on MediaWiki:Monobook.js/he, which includes MediaWiki:Rtl.js, which loads an RTL css file MediaWiki:Rtl.css. However, such a fix would work only in the monobook skin. To get this to work in other skins, someone would need to write scripts and css files for these other skins; then we could use the same technique. In fact, doing this for vector seems to be rather important, given that we'll switch the standard skin in a few days. Lupo\n\nI just did write MediaWiki:Monobook.js/heownwork and so on, and that indeed helps a lot. So, who has the RTL experience and the skills to set this up for vector? Or does the vector switch also include the new upload wizard? In that case, most of it is moot anyway (at least as far as the upload form is concerned). Lupo\n\nOh, it looks good for me in Monobook, too. It's broken in Vector. I should get used to mentioning that i'm using the Beta when i report bugs :)\n\nI can try fixing RTL, but where should i look? --Amir E. Aharoni (talk)\n\nI don't know. I always get confused on RTL wikis, so I can't do it myself. If I'd try this, I'd visit he-WP, set the skin to vector and the user language to Hebrew, and then get all the css files served. Then I'd do the same here, with skin=vector and user language English. Then I'd look for differences in the css served. Then look at MediaWiki:Rtl.css; figure out what exactly it overrides from the default monobook css files. Then develop an RTL css for vector on Commons, which is normally a LTR site. Possibly ask the author of MediaWiki:Rtl.css for help. Then test it by making your own vector.js include the new css just for you. Then debug. Lupo\n\nAs I have worked on MediaWiki:Rtl.css and MediaWiki:Rtl.js before, Amir has contacted me to help. Disclaimer: I have no knowledge in any RTL language at all.\n\nI moved the inclusion of RTL.js from \"monobook.js/XX\" to \"common.js/XX\". That way it will be included for the vector skin too. Then I added code to RTL.js that removes the inclusion of \"main-ltr.css\" (which is always included by default also for RTL languages) and instead includes \"main-rtl.css\". For me it looks okay that way. But please review it. --Slomox (talk)\n\nFor what it's worth, the Multimedia Usability project is working on a brand new interface for uploading. We barely even work in LTR right now, but I'm confident we'll be able to deal with RTL better, using techniques similar to the Vector skin. (In particular, there will not be any uselang hacks like \"heownwork\"). I can't tell you exactly when we'll release, nor exactly when it will be RTL-compatible, but these things will be happening in the coming months. You might want to consider this before embarking on a major rewrite. We'll be demoing and doing some formal usability studies this month, although only in English. If you want to offer comments or be a part of the process you can get in touch with me or Guillom. NeilK (talk)\n\nI realise this has been discussed before, but, thanks to some issues with harassment on en-wiki, I now find myself unwilling to ever edit there, making this a somewhat pressing issue for me.\n\nThere are a number of works which are public domain in the United States, because they were created prior to 1923. These may or may not be in the public domain in their home countries.\n\nI'd like to suggest that Commons allows such uploads, with a large warning noting their PD status is limited to the US (Canada, and a few other countries).\n\nThis has been a long-standing source of controversy, but I now find myself in a situation where assuring I have a repository for such content would be a good thing, and I would like to appeal for a change in policy to accomodate this. Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nThat would be quite a large change and probably would never happen. Commons' content policies require images to be free in both the source country and the US. If I understand you correctly, you're proposing that we allow all content published prior to 1923 to be allowed on Commons because it is public domain in the US? Killiondude (talk)\n\nThat is also my understanding of the proposal, and I don't see Adam Cuerden's reasoning as sufficient to change the current policy. If he is that vehemently set against enwiki, there remains the possibility of emailing the images to photosubmission wikimedia.org (although that's backlogged about five months). Stifle (talk)\n\nI don't think it's good idea, since Commons contents may be used outside USA too. And current Commons:Licensing#Interaction of United States copyright law and non-US copyright law serves this purpose much better then your proposal. Please remember that only works published in USA before 1923 is public domain in USA, not everything created before 1923. --EugeneZelenko (talk)\n\nEr, remember? That's not what the US Copyright Office says: \"Therefore, the U. S. copyright in any work published or copyrighted prior to January 1, 1923, has expired by operation of law, and the work has permanently fallen into the public domain in the United States.\"[6]. That works published outside the US didn't get treated as published works in the US is admittedly what the Twin Books decision says, but that's not binding on anything outside the 9th Circuit, and it's widely derided as bad law.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nEugeneZelenko was referring to works created before 1923 but not published, i.e. the publication requirement -- those are not necessarily PD in the U.S., and Adam Cuerden's original post did use \"created\" instead of \"published\". Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nApril 5\n\nHi, I just recently uploaded an image from Flickr under \"Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Generic\". I didn't realize it until I after I uploaded, what cc-by-2.0 meant. My understanding is \"Noncommericial\" use is not allowed and CC-BY-SA is required? The uploader originally had all rights reserved and I contacted them and asked if they could release it under Creative Commons, and this is the type they released it under. Should I ask them if they could release it as Creative Commons Sharalike? Thanks. MikeAllen (talk)\n\nI would say yes. We don't allow noncommercial licenses here. Wknight94 talk\n\nYes, if they are willing. We accept CC-BY and CC-BY-SA; any of the CC variants with \"NC\" or \"ND\" in them, we can't take. \"Creative Commons\" is a term for a large family of licenses, but we can only take certain licenses from that family. CC-BY-SA is the more restrictive one, but it can still be used for commercial purposes. Carl Lindberg (talk)\n\nIt was a mistake. They are like me, confused by all the options and what they mean. They have released it under Attribution 2.0 Generic. So that would be CC-BY? I think some people just put under license \"None (All rights reserved)\" because they don't understand the other options. lol Thanks for the help. :) MikeAllen (talk)\n\nBY = attribution (like in \"this photo has been taken by John Doe\"), SA = share alike, NC = non-commercial, ND = no derivative. --GaAs11671\n\nOn April 1 i reported that the display of Hebrew in the Vector skin is broken because of flaky right-to-left support.\n\nNow i'm glad to report that most of the problems have been fixed thanks to the efforts of Slomox, Eran, The Evil IP address and Yuval Y.

That version remained for three years until March 5, 2010 when User:Shakko uploaded this version [8], which is clearly a totally different version of the same painting. The one originally uploaded differs from the the new version. His mouth, for example, is slightly open in the original one. On March 7, 2010 User:DrKiernan re-uploaded the version that was originally uploaded by User:Carolus . On April 3, 2010 I restored that version by fixing the color and removing white spots [9].

If not, what is the provenance of the second version? — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nHe made copies of the same painting, but there are slight differences as I've already pointed out. The second one is not only smaller and darker, but the mouth is different. The version I uploaded is the same as the original upload, I just removed some of the white spots that were all over it and I adjusted the color so it wouldn't look so dark. Andrew0921 (talk)\n\nAs you can see my upload [10] is just a cleaned up version of the original [11]. They are the same, just one is an improvement of the original. Andrew0921 (talk)\n\nFor many uses, an edited version can be interesting, but for paintings we should also have a version available that reflects the condition of the work when it was reproduced. -- User:Docu at\n\nSorry, I misread Docu's earlier message. Were your edits to the original image limited to removing artefacts that were introduced by the photography process, or does what you did amount to an \"electronic restoration\" of the image (that is, you removed flaws that exist in the actual painting)? If the former, I think it is fine if you upload the touched-up version. If the latter, then I think it is better if you leave the original image as it is, and upload the touched-up version under a different name such as \"George III in Coronation Robes (touched up).jpg\". The different version of the painting should be uploaded under a different name, ideally with information about when it was painted. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI did an electronic restoration, but I didn't drastically alter it. I removed white spots that weren't put there by Allan Ramsey, and I fixed the color since it was faded. When Allan Ramsey first painted it there weren't white spots or faded coloring from centuries of dust. Either way, I uploaded my version separately just now [12]. Andrew0921 (talk)\n\nI thought it was the fragment of big one, so i've upload it. Bad, that I didn't understand it is another, and didn't upload as another file.Shakko (talk)\n\nAndrew – thanks. I realize the spots or fading weren't there when Ramsay painted the portrait in the 18th century, but, as Docu pointed out, there is value in having an image which captures the current state of the painting. Thus, I think that it is more appropriate to upload your touched-up version separately. Shakko – it seems the image you uploaded is a different version of the portrait by Ramsay. If you intend to upload it, please indicate when it was painted and the current location of the original painting, if you have this information. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI've created Category:George III by Allan Ramsay.

Personally I think the restored version should be used in articles since it looks closer to what Allan Ramsey originally intended, while the un-restored version should have a link to it if anybody wants to see the current state. Andrew0921 (talk)\n\nNo objection from me. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nAlso @ Shakko, the fact that it is from Williamsburg probably explains why it looks different since Virginia was a colony and they shipped a copy and not the original. Andrew0921 (talk)\n\nNo, it seems that Williamsburg's copy is a recent acquisition. See the first source stated on the image description page. It seems that Ramsay's studio produced over 200 copies of the original painting. Sorry, another mistake.

In my past experiences, most proposed \"warnings\" (though not for this kind of reason) were strongly rejected; you know, the \"we-are-not-censored mantra\". The only established \"warning\"-tag is {{Colour blind}}; however, I've never seen it used. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nYet, in this case, I think it's worth to try. Do you know where can I propose this? LianRad (talk)\n\nEither here or at COM:AN. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nI have reduced the frames from 32 to 15 and changed the frame display rate from 30ms (which may trigger epileptic fits) to 120ms. Is that any better for you? Richard Harvey (talk)\n\nMuch better. LianRad (talk)\n\nHey people, I am from Germany and we got a funny construction in our language. We have got dots over certain letters. Especially we do this for the letter u. Resulting in and the very strange letter ü. In the UTF-8 character encoding this is represented by two Bytes. If truncate a text to a certain number of Bytes you may cut it into two parts. And in the end you get an illegal UTF-8 character. The problem is that my sirname contains the letter ü, and so does my username. Mediawiki splits that way and creates illegal XML. And when I use a certain tool to extract some kind of information from the webpages on the commons, the XML-Parser complains about improper XML. Thus I reupload and relink until I am lucky and Mediawiki cuts at the right place. Somehow this solution to the problem is not very amusing to me.\n\nThe following image serves as an example of the problem explained above.\n\nNote the appearance of the letter ü in my username Dirk Hünniger (talk)\n\nYou are talking about Special:Export, e.g. Special:Export/File:NuclearMedicineImageOfAHandAfterShadowFilter-2.png ? -- User:Docu at\n\nNo, it is the page you see when you click on the image. Copy paste the URL into the W3C validation service and you get:\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3ANuclearMedicineImageOfAHandAfterShadowFilter-2.png&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nAnd you get error on line 204 which is an ü split into two parts.Dirk Hünniger (talk)\n\nNot sure which line is line 204, but it's likely the one with the excerpt from the upload log. The text there is initial part of the first version of the file description page. It has some use when manually checking the upload page, but in general, I don't think it's meant to be machine readable.\n\nThe question is if it can or should be fixed to make sure the page validates. In general, it's suggested to use the database dumps, special:export or the api for tools. -- User:Docu at\n\nYes it is a truncated excerpt form the upload log. I am using the Special Export stuff too. But for this particular function I am using the Webpage as is. Dirk Hünniger (talk)\n\nI agree that looks like a problem. I would suggest searching bugzilla for related bug reports, and if they do not have any, filing one.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nI just did a search, and this looks like bugzilla:332. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nAs announced last week, Commons will have new user interface as of 06:00 UTC on April 6. --Shuhari (talk)\n\nNice to hear that. It's not usual that I get excited before some events, but this time I really can't wait until it happens, don't ask me why. FYI, I've started a planning of the sitenotice at MediaWiki talk:Sitenotice#Interface change. If you speak a language other than English, French or German, your fellow language speakers and I would appreciate if you could help with translations. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nDid you see the translation of sitenotice above grow rapidly? Cbrown1023 spread the word to the translator community. Thanks, Cbrown1023. --Shuhari (talk)\n\nI take the liberty to post in this thread. I have switched back to monobook, but I would also like to switch back to the old edit form? Settings options are half translated, half not, and for some of them it is really unclear what they refer to. What settings should I use to revert to the old-fashion edit form? Thanks in advance. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nGo to Special:Preferences and hit \"Editing\". Uncheck the two checkboxes in the \"Beta features\" box. Regards, -- ChrisiPK (Talk|Contribs)\n\nThanks. --Eusebius (talk)\n\nThanks as well ChrisiPK. I abhor Vector for its dumbing down of the interface, so being able to completely go back to basics is a blessing. — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nAwesome! --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nApril 6\n\nWe have a lot of photographs of statues here on Commons, like one on the right, and other works of art from Japan, though the Japanese law says such images can be used only for non-commercial purposes, which is against the policy of Commons.\n\nOn the other side, Japanese copyright law says that all non-photographic works enter the public domain 50 years after the death of the creator.\n\nHow should we deal with them? Should we remove them altogether, or should we keep them when possible and also mark using {{PD-Japan}} and {{FoP-Japan}} templates? Is there a need for additional templates and such? Laitr Keiows (talk)\n\nSomeone familiar with Japanese copyright law will need to confirm this, but it seems to me that the freedom of panorama rules can only apply to artworks such as sculptures that are still copyrighted. If a sculpture has entered the public domain because 50 years have elapsed after the death of the creator, then it makes no sense if rules relating to freedom of panorama still restrict its reproduction. I'd say there shouldn't be any problem with the Commons hosting photographs of ancient sculptures in public places. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nI agree, if sculpture is PD no need to speak of FOP. But how to indicate that on the description page ? --GaAs11671\n\nBeing bold I added a comment regarding public domain to the {{FoP-Japan}}. Laitr Keiows (talk)\n\nI don't think the FoP templates were meant for artworks whose copyright has expired. I think the FoP template should be removed, while the \"|author=\" and \"|date=\" contents in the {{Information}} template should provide enough information to ascertain that the artwork is in the Public Domain in Japan (architect or painter or sculptor's death year + 50 years : Template:PD-Japan). File:Aritoshi-jinja (Katsuragi, Wakayama) komainu.jpg should be deleted because the information on the sculptor's death year is not provided. Teofilo (talk)\n\nWhy takes it so long after opening the edit mode before the toolbar appears and I can start editing? Is this because of the new interface?\n\nPossibly. What browser and OS are you using ? And if you are willing to provide some details on the age/type of computer you use, that might be useful as well. TheDJ (talk)\n\nI saw the same in the past few days. But not today (FF3.6 + XP or Vista). --GaAs11671\n\nSame for me. Not very long, but slower, so boring when editing many photos. I returned to Monobook. Jack ma (talk)\n\nbrowser Explorer 8, Computer HP pavillion dates three years next june, (what do you mean by OS?) only commons is slow, not wikipedia. I just found out that only pages I open to edit for the first time are slow, somewhat 6 à 8 seconds; the second time opening is normal. --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nFor a possible fix, see #Problems with edit box above... AnonMoos (talk)\n\nMy two pence : 1) 1st penny: I think there is already too much Bundesarchiv promotion on Commons. For that reason, removing the \"Bundesarchiv\" name from categories' names is a good thing. How about removing the \"Bundesarchiv\" name from file names as well ? Or should I name my files \"File:Teofilo-xyz.jpg\" instead of \"File:xyz.jpg\" in order to advertise myself ? 2) 2nd penny: Bundesarchiv files are sometimes crowding an existing category. In that case - in that case only - introducing the Bundesarchiv pictures as a subcategory is better than crowding the main category (as long as no better subcategorizing scheme is implemented : when a logical, detailed subcategorizing scheme is implemented the Bundesarchiv category can eventually be deleted). One should bear in mind also that, as the fist letter of the Bundesarchiv files is \"B\", these files are shown higher in the category page than the other files which begin with C,D,E,F... Z. If a given category is crowded with more than 200 files, all other files are moved to the second page of the category and become virtually invisible. Teofilo (talk)\n\nI don't think that Bundesarchiv is promotional thing. At least this prefix will make life of Bundesarchiv files uploaders easier since it make file names more unique. Actually same practice is used for images form other archives. I'll definitely not support file renaming just to get rid of Bundesarchiv. --EugeneZelenko (talk)\n\nI got email from medical company claiming that the picture is not about actinic keratosis or cornu cutaneum, but low quality image of keratoacanthoma. What's the proper way to deal with this kind of images? --Harriv (talk)\n\nThe first step would probably be to tag it with {{Doubt}}. You could also request a name change with {{Rename}}; unfortunately, there is currently no formal process for discussing a rename request on Commons, but I see no reason not to correct the name if there's good reason to believe the current one is wrong. In this case, the source article does identify the subject as \"cornu cutaneum on the lip due to actinic keratosis\", so it seems we have the word of one medical professional against that of another. Do you think the person who contacted you would be willing to let you post their reasons for claiming that this identification is wrong, or even willing to participate directly in the discussion here? —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\n{{Doubt}} added. The reason is that \"cornu cutaneum\" looks nothing like that and there's error in source publication. So I believe we need some third party verification about this. --Harriv (talk)\n\nI am trying to edit my uploaded images and made a detailed post of the problem HERE. All relevant pages are on my watch list and any guidance and direction is greatly appreciated. Ineuw talk page on en.ws\n\nI want the missing catscan button back --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nSee #CatScan_link_in_Vector_skin above. -- User:Docu at\n\nI want still the missing catscan button back showing on all categories. Commons changes more and more into a labyrinth, I am not pleased about that. --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nThere is a tab \"CatScan\" just on the right of \"history\" tab. --GaAs11671\n\nNot in the \"new!\" mode --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nIt is only present on C[[:File:]]ategory pages. TheDJ (talk)\n\n--GaAs11671 Can someone check the licensing of this screenshot,?\n\nIt's not on my catpages screen, why !!???--Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nA browser issue? Which web browser (and which version) are you using? For example, Vector (the new look) currently seems broken with ancient browsers like IE 6 (the drop-down menu for extra functionalities, where the CatScan link is relocated when the browser window is too small, doesn't pop up). Works well enough for me with Firefox 3.x (I have been using Vector with Firefox for the past six months or so). Keep also in mind that in the worst case you can always switch back to Monobook in your preferences. -- IANEZZ (talk)\n\nBrowser IE 8. Monobook? --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nProblem solved: I got to My preferences -> Appearence-> I switched from Monobook to Vector (default), restarted, emptied the cache and I got several menu buttons back including catscan and Gallery etc. Thanks. Where has been said that users have to change settings? --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nI read somewhere that only users who never changed the default appearance would be automatically switched to vector. But if you still were with monobook, it should have worked like before, so I don't know. --GaAs11671\n\nWhat do other people think of this image? the long description is a bit odd. Amada44 (talk)\n\nSorry to sound cold and heartless, but this appears to be an attempt (genuine or otherwise) to elicit donations for the medical treatment or rehabilitation of the person pictured, or perhaps merely the use of Commons as a sort of blog: see also User:Anwer Pasha. Either way, these are not legitimate uses of the Commons. The image itself does not readily show a person suffering from a head injury, and so is not useful for illustrating articles either. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nThis is my opinion too. well then, lets delete it? Amada44 (talk)\n\nGo ahead and nominate it for deletion. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nAs per the thread above, I just want to make sure someone deletes all the photos in Category:Photographs from Dermnet.com. Thanks again for the help! ---Kilbad (talk)\n\nThe simplest thing would be that Madhero Special:Nuke his uploads, he knows them and can do this without reviewing them individually. The nuke is possible for 1 month, so hurry. Otherwise we can delete all files in that category and restore the 19(?) designated images. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI thought he has admin rights too, but no, so no \"self\" nuke. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nYeah, I think just deleting all the images is a good idea. We can re-upload the 19 later. ---Kilbad (talk)\n\nThe change to the new skin made annotations on images appear bigger, making them more difficult to handle for a visitor, esp. if there are many annotations for a file [14]. Maybe the fontsize should be reduced. best regards, Alexpl (talk)\n\nActually, it's the other way 'round: vector has a smaller main text font size than the other skins. The text of the notes has the same size in both skins, but it appears larger on vector because everything else on vector has become smaller. Lupo\n\nAs far as I can remember, this is a new problem making the AJAX useless when newly created categories are concerned. Do you remember if there ever was a time lag in the past when you created a new category and wanted to find it again using the autocomplete feature in the search engine, or as I am trying to do now, when trying to move files into that new category using the Hotcats gadget ? Is it pointless if I report this as a bug in bugzilla ? Teofilo (talk)\n\nThe search index has always been slow to update, though the actual delay has varied from \"not quite instant\" to \"glacially slow\" and back over the years, depending on things like hardware availability and usage levels. I looked at the history of the HotCat gadget, and it seems it was changed back in late December to use the search index instead of list=allpages (which is basically equivalent to Special:Allpages). I'm not sure why the change was made (performance reasons?), but that might be what you're noticing. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nThe change was made basically because people wanted to have some Unicode collation (i.e., on input \"Sidl\", also show categories starting with \"Sídl\"), which opensearch does give us. The downside is indeed that the search index is updated only in intervals, and you thus don't get newly created categories. It could be changed back, of course. Or made configurable, such that users can choose which they want. Lupo\n\nIt would be great to have it configurable. Teofilo (talk)\n\nBug reported at https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23101 Teofilo (talk)\n\nSince today the function is not working propperly. The 4 tabs are opened correcty with the correct changes, but they don't do the \"autosubmitt\". I think the new \"vector\" changes are responsible. Even when I changed to the old monobook style, it doesn't work.--Avron (talk)\n\n+ 1 - I have the same problem. I have no idea what a monobook is (and I do not want to know) - a DR takes much more time. Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nI have changed back to monobook, but it does not work either. Cholo Aleman (talk)\n\nI don't think it was any changes made today that caused this. I noticed almost two weeks ago when making this deletion request using the \"nominate for deletion\" function in monobook skin, that the edits were not saved automatically like they were before. /Ö\n\nThis seems to be the same problem that I had for months last year. See MediaWiki talk:Quick-delete-code.js#Quick-delete gadget not saving the pages. I never found the cause or any solution to that problem. I just waited months until it miraculously worked again. Right now everything seems to be OK on my computer. Teofilo (talk)\n\nI had similar problems a few month ago, I cleaned my personal subpages from bad javascripts given to me by others, cleaned my computer from temp-files, emptied the cache and things got right again. --Havang(nl) (talk)\n\nYou have been lucky. I think I had gone as far as uninstalling Firefox and installing it again. Teofilo (talk)\n\nCould someone please follow-up on this? A major clean-up is needed. All Commons:Dermnet photos need to be deleted except the few exceptions noted in that thread. Commons:Dermnet itself should probably also be deleted. ---Kilbad (talk)\n\nI'm the OTRS admin who handled these images. I've already written a follow up to the copyright holder through the system in order to have that attached to the ticket, and then I'll work on deleting the images (or would it be easier to have a bot do it?). I can run AWB to remove the permission template and replace it with a no-permission speedy deletion template, or I can hand delete them one by one. I feel partially responsible, so I don't mind doing the legwork, but if there is a bot that could help, that'd be nice as well. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nI think this whole thing was a misunderstanding on Dr. Habif's part, and no fault of any editors here. Thanks again for all your help! All the images in Category:Photographs_from_Dermnet.com should probably be deleted asap... ---Kilbad (talk)\n\nI've deleted like 500+ images related to this. We have permission currently for 21 images, and I've made that list a protected page, just in case someone tries to use the category or permission template. Any more issues or concerns, contact me on my talk page. Thanks. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-301-1951-17, Nordfrankreich, leichte Schützenpanzer in Stadt.jpg is originally described with Ende Juli/Anfang September 1944 meaning from the end of July to the beginning of September, and the caption written on the picture frame reads 1944 Sommer (Summer of 1944). It turns out that apparently because the Summer begins on a 21st of June, the \"|date=\" parameter of the {{Information}} template has been \"translated\" into \"21 June 1944\"... Teofilo (talk)\n\nYes, thats a wrong \"translation\" in Commons. Better is something like {{other date|between|1944-07|{{other date|early|1944-09}}}} according to the description or {{other date|season|summer|1944}} according to the date field. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nThanks for pointing out this {{Other date}} template. I'll try to use it. Teofilo (talk)\n\nI often use the gallery function under \"my contributions\". This seems to be disabled in the new vector skin. Can somebody fix it or do I have to set monoboook in my preferences again? Woudloper (talk)\n\nI think there's still a tab that says \"Gallery\" if you visit your user page and look at the row of tabs. But perhaps somebody could make a new tab in the vector.css or whatever for the contribs page.

I did not look at OTRS but the file seemed to be released under CC license, so even if we delete it anyone has right to reupload the file using the same license.

Will do so as a last resort. Thanks. Liz Kearley\n\nIs there something to tag an image as \"FOP status unknown\". If no (I don't think Template:FOP is for that, as is states \"it is believed that the taking, uploading and reuse of this derivative work is permitted\"), shouldn't we create a template similar to Template:Doubt?\n\nI think we should deprecate (ie put a \"deprecated\" tag on) Template:FOP, which is too generic, in favor of country specific templates found in Category:FOP templates.\n\nIf you know sthg about FOP in Senegal, see Commons_talk:Freedom_of_panorama#What_about_Senegal?.\n\nRegards. --GaAs11671\n\nI disagree. You don't need tons of country-specific FOP templates. The FOP template is an indication template for downstream users, telling them that the work shown is still copyrighted (at the time the picture was taken) in its source country, is considered OK here because that source country does have FOP (or did have it when the picture was made), but that re-uses may or may not be restricted, depending on whether or not the country the downstream user is in has FOP. There's absolutely no need for country-specific versions of that, and there's no need to deprecate {{FOP}}. Lupo\n\nThe problem is that its text is really not clear about when this template is applicable or not, eg File:Orsay1.jpg (in France, no FOP). At least we should add a mandatory parameter for the country with a link to the correct section of COM:FOP. --GaAs11671\n\nIf you'd like to improve the wording of the template, go ahead. BTW, {{FOP}} is not a license tag, so File:Orsay1.jpg is missing a license anyway. And furthermore, in many countries FOP applies only outdoors. That image is just completely mistagged. Lupo\n\n(for File:Orsay1.jpg, you are totally right) « In many countries FOP applies only outdoors », that's a good example of what I blame in {{FOP}}: it is a long generic blabla about FOP, but it doesn't say what is applicable to this image I'm currently looking at. That's why I prefer country specific templates. --GaAs11671\n\nOr create a {{FOP-unknown}} for photos of works considered not out of copyright in the source country, but the source country is not (yet) listed at COM:FOP and Commons guidlines cant say if FOP applies or not. The template should have a parameter 1=countryname. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI'll do it. Thanks for the name. --GaAs11671\n\nDone Juridical English is not my cup of tea, so please improve Template:FOP-unknown/en. I'll do the french version meanwhile. (May be spanish version also, but sure not german one.) --GaAs11671\n\nPlease do not do so before adressing the question on the FOP talk page. Some relatively small or remote coutries can have un updated easy to understand well translated copyright law available on the internet, for example in the WIPO database, and in such cases creating a Commons guideline from scratch can be very easy. On the other hand, some countries have an \"entry\" at COM:FOP, but we are still at loss to fathom what the lawmakers of the countries really had in mind when they wrote their laws (for example the so strange laws of Tunisia and Vietnam). Teofilo (talk)\n\nWe are deleting many pictures which will be free in some years. Should we not have a kind of template that enables to restore them automatically when the date of freedom has arived? --Mbdortmund (talk)\n\nAn interesting idea, but the problem is that the Commons would have to somehow store copyrighted images while waiting for them to enter the public domain, and this might amount to copyright infringement. (I wonder if it makes a difference if the images are not made publicly accessible.) I see a parallel between what you're suggesting and the lawsuits brought by the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers against Google arising out of the Google Books Library Project, which involved Google creating digitized copies of copyrighted works. The disputes ended up with Google having to settle for $125 million (see \"Google Book Search Settlement Agreement\"). Perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation's legal counsel should be consulted on this. — Cheers, JackLee –talk–\n\nWhat Commons needs is a \"time capsule\" feature, where you can temporarily hide or delete an image until a certain year. Of course this is somewhat dubious since the government will simply extend copyright terms again as soon as they are about to expire. :P Kaldari (talk)\n\nThe deleted pictures are stored on our servers anyway but invisible for non-admins. I think the idea of Kaldari sounds good, but there must be a script or database which handles the dates. --Mbdortmund (talk)\n\nDeletion requests can be placed in Category:Undelete in 2011 (or whatever the correct year is). Pruneautalk\n\nThx , I will use that in future. --Mbdortmund (talk)\n\nEven Category:Undelete in 2068 already exists … :-) --Rosenzweig δ\n\nSeems the gagdet is not working properly since vector, it might be unrelated still, I just don't know.

Bawolff (talk)\n\nDo files no longer list their usage on other pages besides the Commons, such as on Wikipedia?

Fry1989 (talk)\n\nSeems to have disappeared... :/ Algkalv (talk)\n\nSee the \"Global usage\" tab at the top, the usage has moved from the bottom to Special:GlobalUsage, the \"Global usage\" tab replaces the old toolserver \"Check usage\" tab. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI see no such tab anywhere. It's not the tab that disappeared (leastaways, that's not what is being reported), but a listing available by default without any tab/link execution. Now, there is only an injected list of commons pages linking to the file. Previously, WP pages using the image were listed too, below the latter. Algkalv (talk)\n\nYeah, I can't find that tab either Fry1989 (talk)\n\nFor the record, I'm using monobook. Algkalv (talk)\n\nStrange, if I log out and go to a Special:Random/File I still have the Global usage tab. Logged out I can only say for Vector skin but all browsers. Logged in I have it for both skins. Maybe you have some specials activated that hide the tab, dont know. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI have the tab in Monobook, but I must say this is an incredibly annoying change. It was rather handy having it on the same page, so I could simply scroll down and see the usage. Who must I bribe to have it changed back? ;) — Huntster (t @ c)\n\nI hope your bribe is sufficiently high to get this regression fixed ;) Algkalv (talk)\n\nWell, I could have guessed. The listing is gone (apart from the commons listing), and the tab you talk about is only available if JS is a) available, b) on. Replacing content with a JS doohickey... might as well convert the site to flash. How evil. How 1997. Does accessibility mean nothing anymore to W*? I'm lost for words... :/ Algkalv (talk)\n\nStrange thing is using the vector skin on en.wikipedia global usage is where its useful at the end of the page, so if you want to view in situ then hope the image is on en. so it something they've set for Commons. I agree the tab is a backwards move and I'm willing to throw a few more sheckles into the bride to get reversed. Gnangarra\n\nI agree, global usage should be where it is useful and available in any configuration, i.e. at the end of the file page. --Myrabella (talk)\n\nComment I filed Bug 23136 "
