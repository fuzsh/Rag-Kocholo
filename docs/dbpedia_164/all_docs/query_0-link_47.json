The old version is now permanently defunct (since November 2012), and all new blogging is now hosted on the new WordPress blog.\n\nBeing the first post, ever\n\nIt has become increasingly apparent to me over the past few years that, for this web site to survive as a continuing concern, it will need to include a blog. As loathe and as late as I am to conform to societal norms, here it is. To perpetuate the proud tradition of outmoded 1995 technology exemplified by the rest of this web site however, this blog (and its RSS feed!) will continue to be coded by hand in a text editor. Welcome.\n\n2007.09.24 at 5:00pm EDT\n\nI love it when the web treats me bad\n\nA few months ago, I jumped into the \"Cat Macro\"/\"LOLcat\" trend with both feet and LOL'ed the entire Rocky Horror Picture Show to create the LOLcky Horror Picture Show. This project didn't go unnoticed by the world, and I have the traffic stats to prove it. I was very, very disappointed when the Wall Street Journal article about the trend didn't mention my page, but I'm always delighted when virtually anybody else does.\n\nToday I got the bright idea of replacing the 404 page for my site with an appropriate LOL image. I understand I'm not the first to think of this, as when I started doing searches I found several mentions of other sites and the ones they use.\n\nThis is a long prologue to me being delighted that this page about LOLcats links to me using the word \"craze\".\n\n2007.09.25 at 10:00am EDT\n\nBook Crates now for sale\n\nThe big stack of book storage crates I made earlier this year to hold books during our recent home renovations are taking up space in the attic, so I've decided to put them up for sale. Let me know how many you want!\n\n2007.09.26 at 5:00pm EDT\n\nIt's like 2003 meets 1993 meets 1983\n\nI repent of my rash pronouncement that this blog would be all done by hand. I've decided that's silly when there are shell scripts I could be writing. After a bit of research and asking around, I've found that instead of doing everything by hand I can do much of what I want with SSI and shell scripting.\n\nEvery time I start researching PHP or one of the other common ways of implementing a blog, I find out there at least a dozen files to install and learn how to modify, and maybe even some database to configure. Here's me with a directory full of entries, a few index files, and couple of shell scripts.\n\nYeah, that's right, I'm old school. In case you're interested, here's a link to the script that returns the ten most recent posts, and the script that returns the items for the rss. There are probably better ways to write these scripts. The two scripts just get called in the middle of wrapper HTML. Each post contains all its own meta information.\n\n2007.09.27 at 5:00pm EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nMischa (blue point) and Ethel (white)\n\n2007.09.28 at 12:00am EDT\n\nUdon for Lunch\n\nMy default lunch lately is a big steaming bowl of soup with udon noodles. Mmm. I have a whole set of supplies for preparing lunch at the office in the microwave.\n\nBasically, I keep packages of noodles in the fridge or freezer. You can buy them frozen or even supposedly fresh at any good oriental grocer. If they're frozen I have to remember to take them out when I get to work in the morning so they'll be usable by lunch time. These are loads better than dried noodles you have to boil. Jumbo udon are thick (like 1/4 inch) and chewy.\n\nThe noodles almost always come with little packets of instant broth, that I typically never use. I have a bottle of concentrated soup base in the fridge. This can be difficult to find.\n\nTo turn this into a meal I keep dried or canned things in my desk or fresh ingredients in the fridge. Dried shiitake mushrooms, freeze-dried tofu, and dried wakame seaweed are a good kit. In the fridge I've had fish sausage, pickled daikon, and sansai mountain vegetables. I tried some frozen, fried fish patties last week and they were interesting. yesterday I opened a can of mixed \"oriental vegetables\" and that was good, though a bit heavy on the bamboo shoots.\n\nAnyway, at lunch time I pour a couple of tablespoons of soup base into a bowl, add whatever dried or fresh ingredients I want, put the noodles in on top, and then fill with water from the tap. The bowl goes into the microwave and six to seven minutes later I have a yummy lunch.\n\nLast time I was in Young's grocery on Forward, I saw that in the aisle where they have mostly packaged, dried ramen, they also had instant udon. These weren't dried, I guess they're just packed aseptically because they seemed soft in there. Some time I'll have to try a pack (79 cents) and see if they're wretched.\n\n2007.10.01 at 12:00am EDT\n\nI am freaked out\n\nI started working on this blog last week, more because I was finally getting around to something than because I really wanted a blog. Sometimes when I put something up on my web site, I have to figure out where to announce it, that is, if I even want to announce it at all. Much of what goes on my web site is just documenting a project so I can refer people to it, and not to publicize anything. I figure if I have a blog then people can subscribe one central palce, and if they care that much about my web site then I can bother them when I care to publicize a new release.\n\nSome of my friends have started blogs, updated them pretty regularly for a while, and then stopped. I usually stop looking at their blog after a month of inactivity, and they go back to posting to mailing lists or whatever it was they did before they started their blog. When I started this, I made the decision that I'd try posting to it at least daily for at least a month before I announced it anywhere. I added a link to this blog from my front page, and figured I'd leave it at that so at least when I finally give in to temptation and announce this blog somewhere there will be a backlog of posts for people to read through and not just a single post titled... well, you can see the title in the archives.\n\nI am very curious about my site's web traffic, however, so I go grepping through my logs every once in a while to see where people are coming from and such. Today I noticed that this blog's rss file is getting pinged every few hours by some process at LiveJournal. Following referrer URLs, I see that someone found this blog, and subscribed to it using LiveJournal's aggregator. I have a reader.\n\nThank you, my one mysterious reader, you have freaked me out. Don't worry, I enjoy being freaked out. Tell your friends. If I can get one reader in less than a week, I can have 52 by this time next year!\n\n2007.10.01 at 4:07pm EDT\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nLiberty Tubes, Pittsburgh\n\n2007.10.02 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTravel\n\nWhen I was younger, I always though it would be cool to be one of those people who travel a lot. You know, maybe some kind of business person with meetings and vacations all over the world.\n\nWhen I actually had a job where I had to travel, I changed my mind. Even though I was only travelling once a month, and then for only a couple of days each month, it was too much. The planning, the logistics, the disruption, &c. were just too much for my apparently fragile state of mind. Maybe it's easier if you're an executive with some kind of assistant or something to at least arrange all your itineraries, but just thinking about it was a full time job.\n\nRight now, I'm planning some personal travel for the next few months. These are mostly weekend things like weddings and conventions, and again it's just one thing a month for a couple of days at a time, but what a pain in the neck. Hotel reservations with three different chains, airline tickets, driving directions, JKMN.\n\n2007.10.03 at 12:00am EDT\n\nPittsburgh's geekiest networking night\n\nSo, I'm thinking it's been about nine years that I've been going to Geek Night. A reporter called me earlier this week to interview me about the event, so I thought I'd write a few words about it here.\n\nGeek Night is a social event, first and foremost. There are no dues, nobody takes attendance, and the closest thing to a membership list is a mailing list to receive reminders. There are no officers, no hierarchy, and nobody is technically \"in charge\". There are a few people who handle making the arrangements for the event and providing a personal front end, but the don't make speeches and I bet most attendees would be hard pressed to pick them out of the crowd. Geek Night is not a meeting, it is a bunch of geeks taking over a large percentage of a large bar. We eat, we drink, and we socialize.\n\nSecondarily, it's a professional networking night. Some food is provided, and this is typically paid for by a local company that is looking to hire some geeks. Most people use it to keep track of former co-workers, and it's not unusual to chat with friends who are looking for new opportunities, or who are looking to help fill an opening at the company where they work.\n\nThirdly, Geek night is an excuse to go to the Church Brew Works for a few beers and some food. The beer is brewed on the premises, and is pretty good. The food is also good, and pairs well with the beer. The ambiance is unparalleled in Pittsburgh. The CBW is a converted church with high ceilings, good acoustics, and an altar to the spirits of zymurgy.\n\nYou should come.\n\n2007.10.04 at 10:30am EDT\n\nAha!\n\nI've discovered your identity, oh my first reader. Oh yes, I have. This explains much. Come to my site looking for my email address, see the blog link right near the mail link, and follow it\n\nNow, I wonder who LJ reader #2 is. Hi!\n\n2007.10.04 at 2:30pm EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nDodger and his fantastic whiskers\n\n2007.10.05 at 12:00am EDT\n\nFitting In\n\nSo over the weekend, I went to a kind of convention I'd never attended before. I went to a Furry convention. Here's the part where I'm supposed to deny actually attending the convention and claim I was only there as some kind of observer or ambassador (I'd been asked by some friends on the committee to run game demos), but you know what? I had a good time.\n\nThis particular subculture is much maligned and often misunderstood. While much of what you've probably heard is true to some extent, you're probably overestimating the extent, and there's probably a lot more \"normal stuff\" going on than you know. Most of all, these people know how to have fun.\n\nNow, I was definitely an outsider. Most of the people there (there were about 100) already knew each other from other conventions and Internet communication, and only a few of them knew me. Everybody was very friendly, though. Everybody I smiled at smiled back, and everybody I said hello to greeted me back. They weren't all hitting on me, either. (There was one guy, but he was cute and didn't try too hard. He just didn't seem to notice my ring.)\n\nI didn't see anything happen that I would have considered \"family unsafe\". I'm sure plenty went on back in people's hotel rooms, but like most adults, intimate acts were kept private. I've been to family reunions with more inappropriate behavior. There was considerably less swearing than I would have expected from a large group of primarily men in their 20's to 40's. I'd say there were probably about ten women there total, giving this group a higher percentage than the groups I used to hang around with in college.\n\nPrimarily, people were there to have fun, and hang out with people they shared an interest with. We watched movies. I played a bunch of games of course. There was an outdoor barbeque. People played frisbee and lasertag. People swung on the swings and lay around in the sun chatting. They put on a show.\n\nOne thing I'd never known (and was delighted to discover) is that most of the fur suiters are really good at it. They have characters and routines. Most can't really talk, so they have these elaborate pantomimes that are hilarious to watch. Over time I got to know which of the people were in some of the costumes (they rarely appear \"headless\", so it takes a bit of detective work) and the two personalities were often very different. Somebody who seemed sullen without their suit would reappear as a mischievious hyena or something. It really is like slipping in and out of a cartoon.\n\nSometimes when I go to conventions where I don't know a lot of people, I wind up feeling isolated. I didn't feel that here. Most people were ready to make new friends, and the people who weren't were just distant, not mean. I did see some people there who didn't seem as able to jump in and start talking to people, but hopefully they'll feel more open next year.\n\nYou know what? I hope I see them there.\n\n2007.10.08 at 11:30pm EDT\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nExiting the Fort Pitt Tubes, Pittsburgh\n\n2007.10.09 at 12:00am EDT\n\n21st Century Chain Letter\n\nWeb 2.0 personal networking web site communities, I say. LinkedIn, that is. Following my spectacular blog debut, I figured I could only top that by following the crowd over to the trough of schmooze juice. I only denigrate because I love.\n\nMan, I remember when SixDegrees.com got people to rat out all their friends and contacts back in the nineties. It was a rough time to be around. Nobody saw the point to these things besides giving out your information to people who wanted to make money off of you. Now, they're big business.\n\nLinkedIn is probably the most professionally oriented, and in some professions/geographies it's become necessary for finding a new job. I'm not looking right now, but browsing its listings for technical writer positions found me better job leads than I've had in some time.\n\nWhile it seems that joining a site like this decreases your privacy (Your relationship information is now known and you are cross-indexed to others. The site actually makes shockingly accurate guesses about who else you might know in its database.), its features actually seek to protect your privacy (at least from other individuals). You can restrict your contact information and force people to contact you through the site. Further, you an restrict the kinds of contact you want to receive.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to promote your professional services online without exposing yourself to marketing and other solicitations, I don't know of a better way. Furthermore, if you need to contact somebody you don't know, and you don't want your email to send up in that person's spam bucket, you can use LinkedIn to maybe discover a common contact who can vouch for you.\n\nWe'll see how I feel about it in the long run. Right now I wish I'd joined it six months ago.\n\n2007.10.10 at 12:00am EDT\n\nI need more icons\n\nLook to the left of this sentence. Eek! It's the same generic icon from the very first post, used on a majority of the 16 posts to this blog. I've used that icon more times than this blog has actual readers. One post had a specially created \"projects\" icon, four were cop-out photo-posts, and one post had a picture of udon. All the rest had this icon. If a bowl of udon is as exciting as this blog gets, I don't see this blog being very exciting.\n\nI was thinking, when I started this blog, that I'd come up with a bunch of icons, maybe one a week to add to the library so that eventually I'd have a nice collection of topical icons like Slashdot. So far, I have two, and I'm really at a loss regarding what more icons would be. I want to use photo icons, but it turns out that most things don't look like things any more if you reduce them to a 64 pixel wide icon. Although, if you do \"View Image\" on the udon picture, you can see a bit more detail.\n\nA good icon for this post might be a picture of my navel.\n\n2007.10.11 at 12:00am EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nNatasha (Tashi) inverted\n\n2007.12.05 at 12:00am EDT\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nI'm absolutely euphoric that Doris Lessing won the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature last week. Years ago, I saw the Canopus in Argos series in the Science Fiction section of what I refer to as \"the library I grew up in\", and I read the first couple of books. The first book, Re: Colonised Planet 5; Shikasta is fantastic. I don't know if I've ever read any other fiction book like it, let alone another science fiction book like it. The second book, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four, and Five was somewhat over my head, in that it was told from the viewpoint of an adult woman and I was a teenaged boy, but even I could see its point.\n\nYears passed before I decided to hunt down the other three books and add the series to my personal library. Each book in the series is markedly different from the others in tone, style, and message, but they all fit together and present a picture of the world that is encouraging and hopeful. Her books are patient with the reader, and more demonstrative than instructive. It's all allegory of course, but it's too easy to get caught up in trying to figure out what is supposed to be what, and lose track of what is happening. Getting to the end of the last book is to reach an epiphany. It all falls into place, though you may have to think about it for a while.\n\nIf I had to sum it all up, I'd say the point is this: \"Those who would consider themselves our enemies, if treated with patience and compassion instead of enmity, will realize they are our equals and partners.\" To be more succint about it: \"Don't fight, live.\" Yet, these books I have been praising are not even considered her most important works! That she has received one of the planet's premier accolades for writing and thinking presents a view of humanity that is as encouraging and hopeful as her books themselves.\n\n(While doing some quick research, I discovered that Ms. Lessing had collaborated in the past with Philip Glass to create operas of two of these books. How beautiful they must be!)\n\n2007.10.15 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nInside the Squirrell Hill Tubes, Pittsburgh\n\nWhen I say \"Tublogging\", you all know I mean \"Tube Blogging\", right? Here in Pittsburgh, locals (known as \"yinzers\") refer to tunnels as \"tubes.\" Just recently, I heard people using the word \"tubes\" to mean \"Internet connection,\" as in \"the hotel's tubes are down.\" Last year, we would have said \"intarwebs\". I suppose in the future, people hereabouts will refer to tunnels as \"Internets\", assuring that nobody has any idea what we're talking about.\n\n2007.10.16 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTruly, you have a dizzying intellect\n\nThe other day, I was having a literary/philosophical discussion with a couple of friends, and while listening to one of them speak I realized that I was just barely able to understand what he was saying. The conversation had reached that point where the words and concepts had become so thoroughly larded with advanced and previously introduced ideas that each word coming out of his mouth was a summary of a paragraph. I was so amazed and distracted by this state of affairs, by the grinding of the gears in my head that were processing this rich stream of thought, that of course I lost the thread and could only smile vacantly.\n\nLet's go shopping!\n\n2007.10.17 at 12:00am EDT\n\nI appear to have peaked\n\nAfter growing exponentially for three weeks in a row, my number of LiveJournal subscribers has stopped increasing. There are four of you, same as last week. Cleary, this blog is not going to continue its phenomenal growth without significant marketing.\n\nAs a first step, I have created a new icon that is wholy unrelated to this post.\n\n2007.10.18 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"Stripehouse\" page updated\n\nI finally added some explanatory text to the project page for my \"Stripehouse\" decorated Treehouse set. This was a fun little pieceniking project to squeeze in as a break during a longer-term project, and it approximates the look of a dream set I designed long ago.\n\nThe dream stash is mostly made of solid colorless crystal, with the edges and corners all in 1/8 inch solid gold. Obviously, the likelyhood of that ever happening is slim, but these plastic pieces with their edges painted gold are a close approximation.\n\n2007.10.18 at 3:00pm EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nNatasha, Mischa, Ethel, and Dodger\n\n2007.10.19 at 12:00am EDT\n\nLore\n\nI've been a fan of Lore since the Brunching Shuttlecocks days, but now his output rate is a little erratic so I tend to ignore him for a few months and then see a link somewhere and spend some time catching up.\n\nDude wrote an article for Wired back in August that pretty much describes exactly the kind of PB&J sandwich I make:\n\nHealthy bread needs to be the color of dust and have visible chunks of what may or may not be chaff. Healthy bread should suck the joy and life from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, assuming you haven't already sucked the joy and life from it by using the sort of peanut butter where the oil rises to the top, and the sort of jelly that's essentially just fruit that someone stepped on.\n\nexcept I use three slices of bread. No, not to keep the peanut butter completely separated from the jelly until you start chewing (although that is an added bonus), but because without that extra slice of bread a PB&J sandwich just isn't enough food. I mean, typically I only make and eat PB&J sanwiches when I am too hungry to think, so two slices of bread just isn't going to fill me up. You got the jelly to boost short-term blood sugar levels, the bread for complex carbohydrates to fuel the next two or three hours (depending on the number of slices), and the peanuts to add protein and fat for long term needs.\n\nThat's the kind of thing I can only think of after I've eaten the sandwich.\n\n2007.10.22 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nTiles of the Fort Pitt tubes\n\nWhen a 1/2 hour drive to work is taking more than an hour, you have to amuse yourself somehow.\n\n2007.10.23 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTruly, you have a dizzying intellect\n\nThe other day, I was having a literary/philosophical discussion with a couple of friends, and while listening to one of them speak I realized that I was just barely able to understand what he was saying. The conversation had reached that point where the words and concepts had become so thoroughly larded with advanced and previously introduced ideas that each word coming out of his mouth was a summary of a paragraph. I was so amazed and distracted by this state of affairs, by the grinding of the gears in my head that were processing this rich stream of thought, that of course I lost the thread and could only smile vacantly.\n\nLet's go shopping!\n\n2007.10.17 at 12:00am EDT\n\nBeing the first month of posting, ever\n\nIn honor of my having completed the first month of this blog, posting every weekday for the entire month, I have created this posting icon.\n\nYou may not have seen this image before, but trust me, a very influential web comic says it's next year's new hotness.\n\n2007.10.24 at 12:01am EDT\n\nThe Beatles\n\nOk, can we all agree that The Beatles are the band most representative of the middle of the 20th century? Expecially given the experimentation they brought to their music as they became more successful which enabled them to explore styles and subjects, the Beatles catalog stands (in my opinion) as the primary textbook for creating 20th century music. Can I possibly hold them with more reverence? Probably not.\n\nHowever, this is now the 21st century. As much as I understand conservative forces that would like to keep change from getting out of hand and preserve things in an understandable form, I also recognize the inevitability of change and the necessity of adapting to that change. Here's an interesting quote from a review of the video for Gnarls Barkely's Crazy by Andrew Olson.\n\nImagine the Beatles music catalog like this great endangered bird living in a cage. We all get to walk up and look at it, but never get to touch it. The bird also sits in a cage and never is free to explore what is out there. The best music ever made needs to be freed from its cage and mixed into new forms.\n\nOlson was referring specifically to DJ Dangermouse's Grey Album, but I think it covers how I feel about the (non-unique) situation occupied by The Beatles in our culture and music. Copyright exists to assure that the original artists receive due compensation for their works, and I certainly support that, however I feel that once created and released into the world, a work of art has its own independant existence. Although I don't consider inanimate works to be creatures, I do think that this existence can be modelled as if the work were a kind of organism. The environment such an organism occupies is our culture.\n\nI hope you'll forgive the extended metaphor, but eventually such an organism becomes bigger and more important than the one that created it. An organism like that cannot be killed, but it can die of neglect. The only way to assure the organism's immortality is to allow it to breed with others and create hybrids and descendants. It has to be let out of the cage, or it will die.\n\nSecretly, under cover of darkness, it already is out of the cage. The children have been bred and are thriving. All that remains is for the owners of the parent to acknowledge it, and rather than fighting to kill these progeny, promote them as the heirs they are.\n\n2007.10.25 at 12:00am EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nEthel curled into a tiny ball\n\n2007.10.26 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"Subwoofer Platform Stand\" project added\n\nAdded a new project page recently for this project to create a little plaftorm stand to keep the left subwoofer speaker of Sharon's stereo off the livingroom floor. This subwoofer stand was necessary because the corner where we wanted to put the subwoofer already has a radiator in it, and we needed to boost the speaker ten inches off the floor or it was going to have to rest on the shut-off valve of the radiator.\n\nThese little projects are a lot of fun when I get to do them. The larger projects are great for making nice things and learning advanced techniques, then when you get to apply those practiced techniques and make a small project look nicer it really adds quality to life.\n\n2007.10.29 at 12:00am EDT\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nTalk to anybody who commutes into, past, or through downtown from the suburbs and you'll hear the same complaint: \"Every day there's a big back-up for the tunnels, but once you get through the tunnels the coast is clear. Why can't we just cruise through the tunnels at speed? Why does traffic slow down?\"\n\nEverybody I've ever talked to asks the same question, which leaves the question: \"If nobody you know is slowing down for the tunnel, then who is slowing down for the tunnel?\" Is it just that the kind of people who slow down for tunnels are also liars? Is it that none of them realizes they are slowing down?\n\nOne of these days I am going to stay up until the early morning, and I am going to stake out the entrance to the Squirrel Hill Tunnels with a video camera. I'm going to tape people entering the tunnel until I can identify who's slowing down and beginning the traffic jam. Then, I'm going to find those people and ask them, \"What exactly is going on here?\" I won't hurt you when I find you. Please do not be afraid.\n\n2007.10.23 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"Cherry Silk Pyjamas\" project added\n\nLast week, I made a pair of Cherry Silk Pyjamas out of a \"raw\" silk fabric similar to some I've used for Japanese garb. It was the Japanese garb that convined me I needed to get some more fabric and make some jammies. It's soft and warm and comfy, like a silk flannel.\n\nSharon was amazed that I got this project done so quickly, especially when I don't really need them for a couple of weeks. Personally, I don't understand how people can procrastinate on hobby projects. I mean, it's your hobby, if you don't want to do it, don't do it. If it was work or something, I could totally understand putting it off.\n\nThis doesn't really have anything to do with Halloween, but it is mildly related to costuming. I usually spend Friday night at a convention bumming around the con in my jammies, and Philcon is coming up in a few weeks.\n\n2007.10.31 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"Minimice 2\" project page expanded\n\nI've had a picture of these Minimice 2 minimal pyramids up for a while, but I only got around to typing up some text recently. Along with the decorated pyramids I posted about a couple of weeks ago, this year saw the first Pieceniking projects I'd done in a while. It was fun to get back into it.\n\n2007.11.01 at 12:00am EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nMischa basking in the sun\n\n2007.11.02 at 8:00am EDT\n\n\"Brass Strike Plate\" project page expanded\n\nI made a brass strike plate to avoid having to buy one, and I just finished up the text explanation for the project.\n\nI find it particularly handy to be able to fabricate small items like this in my home rather than have to search all over for them or spend great gobs of money buying them. I wish I was better at some of the fine points, but my rough approximations are often good enough to substiture for the right thing until the perfect instance comes along.\n\n2007.11.05 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"bLOLd runner\" page released\n\nBack in May, I answered the question, \"What would it be like if Rocky Horror fans had to start over from scratch using only the captions from LOLcats?\" Now, I've answered the question, \"What would it be like if cat LOLers had to start over from scratch using only the screenplay from Blade Runner?\"\n\n2007.11.05 at 12:01am EDT\n\nOne year until Election '08\n\nIt's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and I'm sure there are plenty of elections in this country today, but most people's eyes are on the day roughly one year from today when many of us will vote to choose the next President of the USA. It is on this day that I throw my political weight behind the candidacy of Barak Obama, if and only if he chooses Hillary Clinton to be his Vice Presidential candidate.\n\nLook at what the Republican Party did in 2000. They took an inexperienced candidate with serious deficiencies, paired him with a strong, ruthless, experienced political player, and they won. They changed the paradigm. No longer is the Vice Presidency where you put somebody safe and innoffensive who has a chance of surviving your meltdown if it happens. Now it's where you put your strongest fighter, so that the administration can fight hard while the President's hands remain clean(ish).\n\nI like Barak Obama. He's inspiring and motivating, and what this country really needs right now. I like Hillary. I think she' can do things with this country that I'd like to see happen. I just don't think she's electable as the first name on the ticket. She has too much baggage that will drive away voters. Some people still won't like her being on the ticket at all, but who liked Cheney? I know this will look to some other people like I'm asking Hillary Clinton to again take a back seat to a man, but I'm afraid it may be the only way for her to get into the White House where, I dare say, she belongs.\n\nThe nineties were a wonderful time for this country. It's been a long time since this country had good times like we had when Hillary Clinton was helping a President guide the United States.

I'd heard about the movie Across the Universe, but only just saw this film last night. It's pretty good. Not as good as I'd hoped it would be and wanted it to be, but pretty durn good. It has some difficult to follow parts, and some parts that don't really make much sense, but also it has some parts that are downright brilliant. The army induction sequence is so amazing it almost killed me. It takes a lot of guts to produce a movie these days with so much singing and dancing. While it's not perfect, I give them serious points for trying and succeeding as much as they did.\n\nAnyway, back to my point about remixes. Why should this type of thing be the sole provenance of big-budget movies? I suggested to some friends that the director be granted a degree in literary and cultural studies based on this movie as a thesis, but could an average LCS grad student have legally made this work? I don't think so. Certainly, the grad student would not have been able to present it at conferences or sold it to a publisher without paying millions in royalties, millions that almost definitely don't exist.\n\nThat's a shame, really. Information may not want to be Free, but Art certainly wants to be experienced.\n\n2007.11.07 at 10:00am EDT\n\nSigns of Pittsburgh\n\nLeft & Left ONLY at the corner of Murray & Forward\n\n2007.11.08 at 10:00am EDT\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nClan of the Cave Cats\n\n2007.11.09 at 12:00am EDT\n\n\"Suzuribako\" project page expanded\n\nI've had a picture of this Japanese \"suzuribako\" (ink stone box) up for a while, and I've finally completed the page with text and another picture. This project seemed to take forever with all the sanding and finishing and waiting and sanding and refinishing and painting and waiting and finishing and sanding and finishing. It's only fitting that the project page itself would be delayed waiting for a little polishing.\n\n2007.11.12 at 12:00am EDT\n\nApologies\n\nSorry for the messed up RSS feed over the weekend. I noticed on Friday that things weren't working, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I looked at the xml using an older version of Firefox. This older version didn't know what correct RSS was supposed to look like, but it knew what XML was supposed to look like. Modern browsers just choke if the RSS XML is malformed, but this one was able to show me that I'd (like a moron from 1994) used an actual ampersand (\"&\") in a post's title instead of an HTML \"&amp;\" element.\n\nAs previously noted, I do all this blog coding by hand and the pages are constructed with Shell scripts and SSI (band aids and string, essentially), so it was hard to tell exactly where I'd messed up. Firefox is just too generally helpful to be actually helpful in this case, I guess.\n\nAnyway, I was using this old version of Firefox (Firebird) on an old Win98 laptop that normally just controls X10 plugs in the house because I was replacing the hard drive in my WinXP laptop. At last, having some mostly useless olf hardware around saved my bacon in this case.\n\nPresumably, the problem would have gone away when the offending post fell off the bottom of the feed, and I would have never known what was wrong.\n\nBy the way, SATA hard drives apparently have some weirdness that makes it difficult to set one up from scratch as the main boot drive. This is all over the internet if you search for \"SATA bootable\", but nobody I talked to had any idea what was going wrong for me other than knowing it must have been some MBR problem.\n\nThe answer was to install the new drive, restore the system and re-install Windows using the CD supplied by the laptop manufacturer, then clobber everything by cloning the old drive onto the new one. Now we know.\n\nAt least the whole fiasco gave me the incentive to finally get the Win98 net connection working properly. It turns out that if you want to be able to access hosts by name instead of only by IP address, the \"Enable DNS\" checkbox has to be checked. who knew?\"\n\n2007.11.13 at 12:00am EDT\n\nPalm Depression\n\nAt left is my new icon, a picture of my current PDA. PDA's were never super popular, and they're even less popular now that most people use their phones for the purpose PDAs were intended. For many reasons, I like having my information separate from my phone. I also like having my entertainment separate from my information, which I know makes me about the only person who still carries a phone, PDA, and MP3 player as separate devices. (Not to mention a stand-alone digital camera.)\n\nAnyway, that's a whole spearate discussion I'm not sure I want to get into right now, mostly involving things like battery life. Right now I want to talk about depression.\n\nI've upgraded my PDA about every three years for the past nine. First, I bought a Palm III in 1998. I acquired a Handera 330 PalmOS device in 2001. I bought a Palm Tungsten T3 in 2004 just after the T5 was released. Now it's 2007, and the most likely candidate for upgrade is the TX, which was actually released like two years ago. Palm, like the rest of the market, has mostly been focusing on \"smart phones\". Right now, I think only Palm and HP are even still in the market.\n\nThe main problem is that I use my PDA for all kinds of things. I now have calendar entries going back almost a decade, including all the major family milestones like births. I have thousands of items documented in a database, including all my books and CDs. I have notes, reference materials, pictures, etecetera and I don't see a good way of moving them off the Palm.\n\nSo the Palm Tungsten TX is probably the best choice for me, but let's get real, a lot has happened in the world of technology in the past two years. There are capabilities that weren't even considered in 2005 that are now viewed as necessary for a handheld device. For instance, high speed input for communication is now a must, and Graffiti 2 or the Treo keyboard just don't cut it.\n\nJust today I found out something very exciting, though. Nokia has been releasing \"internet tablets\" for a few years now, and the next one slated for release (the N810) can emulate PalmOS Garnet in a virtual machine. Sweet! I can buy a piece of cutting edge hardware and not have to migrate off PalmOS? Great!\n\nHardware has advanced to the point that it can run the device I want as an application internal to its own device? Now I'm depressed.\n\n2007.11.14 at 12:00am EDT\n\nZombie Fluxx Cardbox\n\nThis game does not come in this box.\n\n2007.11.14 at 12:01am EDT\n\nDriving to Work\n\nOne of the things I don't like about my current workstyle, that is, working as a contract technical writer, is that I get very little say in where (physically) I work. I pretty much take whatever good work is available at the time I need work, whether the work is close to home or some distance away. Currently, I'm working about 15 miles from home, which should only take about 25 minutes, but can often take 45 minutes to an hour. It's my firm belief that every minute you spend on the highway carries with it a certain percentage risk of accident, and so the more time you spend driving the greater the likelyhood you will be involved in an accident.\n\nEarlier this year I was working very close to home. We live on the very Eastern edge of the city, and I was working a bit further East. It took me about ten minutes driving to work, and could sometimes take 20 coming home if there was traffic heading West into the city for some event. (Not that I'd be in the traffic, but the back ways just don't move at highway speed.) I was spoiled then, and I knew it.\n\nHighway speed is part of the problem. Nearly everyone on the highway during rush hour (who isn't stuck in congestion) wants to go at least 60 miles per hour. Typically on highways headed out of the city, traffic flies along at about 70+ miles per hour. (Speed limits on these roads are usually 55.) Now, I am not now, nor have I ever considered myself, a particularly slow or cautious driver, but this is insane. I try to be as observant as possible, as well as considerate to other drivers, but I drive fast and I take chances. Still, having people flying around me, trying to get ahead, squeezing into gaps, treating their progress as paramount to the smooth flow of traffic, etcetera, really makes me think I'm about to die.\n\nIn the past few years I have witnessed the near aftermath of several accidents, witnessed a couple accidents as they happened, and been in a couple of minor bumps and near misses. Every single one of these freaks me out. Nothing drive it further into my mind that it's just a matter of time. The more time you spend on the highway, the closer you get to your inevitable smash-up.\n\nThis is of course by way of apology to the poor person I nearly merged into on the way to work this morning. Sorry. Good use of horn there. Hope I see you tomorrow.\n\n2007.11.15 at 11:00am EST\n\nHee hee hee\n\nSo I realized that right now, since I'm contracting for a network hardware company, it's the perfect time to bring in this old project to hang on my cube wall. They're just hanging there, waiting for somebody to notice. Waiting waiting.\n\n2007.11.15 at 12:00pm EST\n\nThey Still Might Be Giants\n\nSorry, no felines today, just some text about those cool cats They Might Be Giants.\n\nNow, I've been listening to TMBG for a long time, and I've seen them in concert maybe six or seven times. They're a big favorite at CMU where I went to college, and have headlined Spring Carnival maybe three times. They tend to play somewhere in Pittsburgh every time they're on tour, though I don't always make it to the show. I own all their albums on CD, and buy each new one as it comes out, even the kids albums.\n\nEven before the kids albums, TMBG had quite the following with the younger set. I suppose it's because their music is often erudite, always fun, and in any case non-offensive. It's the kind of music somebody can discover in college, bring home at the holidays, and play for their younger siblings without freaking out the parents. Also, the people who were already in college when TMBG first started getting popular probably started having kids pretty soon after that, so starting in 1997 or so second-generation fans started going to shows.\n\nIt was soon after that that I basically stopped going to TMBG shows. I was in my late 20's at the time, and really didn't want to hang out at shows with 12-year-olds. I suppose there was an element of jealousy, in that these kids were way cooler than I was at that age. Once TMBG started putting out kids albums, I realized their audience was only going to get younger and younger, and that I was going to get less and less comfortable attending.\n\nThey (and I) appear to have passed through this phase unharmed, though. A friend of mine was in town on business, and when I mentioned TMBG was playing here she totally wanted to go, having not seen them in concert for maybe 12 years. The concert last night was great. The audience is back to being mostly college age with a long tail of older folks. We were not the oldest people there. I assume the oldest people were the ones whose kids have already gone off to college, allows their pre-parental personalities to resurface.\n\nI've actually seens a quote on the internet to the effect of, \"Yeah, TMBG is the band I don't listen to any more because they're the band Ilistened to a lot when I was nine.\" Now that TMBG has hit their 25th anniversary, I think a lot of their fans of all ages are doing pretty well. Last night at the show they played a smattering of tunes from their entire history, including a couple that went out \"to the god damn kids\".\n\nAnyway, if you stopped going to their shows for the same reason I did, I'd say it's safe for you to give it another try. It's better if you pick a club that has an over-21 area with a bar, just to be sure. Also, pick up their latest album, \"The Else\". It's pretty good.\n\n2007.11.16 at 11:00am EST\n\nFriday Giantblogging\n\nThey Might Be Giants at Mr. Small's Funhouse, 2007.11.15\n\nThis is the best picture I took at the concert, which isn't saying much, I know. Hey, I was nearly all the way in the back by the sound board, because that's where the bar is.\n\n2007.11.16 at 11:30am EST\n\nPhilcon\n\nI went to Philcon, the Philadelphia area science fiction convention, this past weekend. I've attended this convention nearly every year since 1990. I missed the Millenium Philcon (which was a WorldCon), and maybe one or two more, but that leaves more than a dozen times I've been there. I've been through three hotels, and several different weekends (before, just before, and after Thanksgiving).\n\nIt's strange. You know, every annual event has its ups and downs. Great years, bad years, average years, etecetera, and sometimes the difference is in attendee and not the event. This year was pretty average conventionwise, and it was pretty average me-wise.\n\nI had some good times. Some years I don't go to any panels, some years I do panels full time. Some years I don't play any games, some years I play games all day and night. Some years I hang out with friends, and some year I party hop. This year I did a fair number of panels, gamed a bunch, and did zero party hopping. Saturday I did my drinking in the hotel bar, starting an extemporaneous discussion that was better than most of the panels I'd been to, or maybe it only seemed better after two of the hotel's $9.60 martinis.\n\nNext year the convention is moving to a new hotel, although they don't know which hotel, what weekend, or who their guests will be. It should be a fascinating study in weekend-long train wrecking, and if history is any indication, well worth attending.\n\n2007.11.19 at 4:00pm EST\n\nTuesday Tublogging\n\nKittatiny Tunnel, PA Turnpike\n\n2007.11.20 at 12:00am EST\n\nPalm Depression 2|X\n\nA week ago, I lamented the sad state of the Palm OS PDA. This week, Palm announced that they are discounting the two-year-old Palm T|X by $100 for the next week.\n\nIt used to be that when a new Palm PDA model would be released, the price of the previous model would drop by $50. I supose that since this discount is so large, and since there's still no new model to replace it, Palm is tacitly announcing a clearance sale on their PDAs. I'm buying one, not be cause I'm happy about it, but because it keeps me from having to worry about this issue for another three years.\n\n2007.11.21 at 10:00am EST\n\nXII IIT Finals\n\nThe three games in the finals round of the 12th International Icehouse Tournament, held in Columbus, Ohio at the Origins game convention in July of 2001. The finalists are Jacob \"Shotgun\" Davenport (Yellow), Liam Bryan (Green), Elliott \"Eeyore\" Evans (Red), and Dan Isaac (Blue).\n\nI shot these videos back in 2001 during the tournament, but only now decided to put them up on YouTube. The camera was mounted on the Skypod camera boom. These videos have been resampled to 150% of original speed to enable a 15 minute game to be presented in under 10 minutes to meet YouTube's restrictions.\n\nGame 1\n\nJacob wins this game with a near-perfect score of 29 points, Liam scores 25, Eeyore is Icehoused and scores 0, and Dan scores 19.\n\nGame 2\n\nLiam wins this game with a score of 27 points, Jacob scores 25, Eeyore scores 16, and Dan scores 20.\n\nGame 3\n\nEeyore wins this game with a near-perfect score of 29 points, Liam scores 14, Dan scores 24, and Jacob scores 19. Combined with his previous scores and first game win, this game is enough to clinch the championship for Jacob.\n\n2007.11.26 at 12:00am EST\n\nFor the Record\n\nSorry to be morbid, but just so you all know my final wishes, when it is time for me to go, I plan to dive my space ship into the Sun.\n\n2007.11.28 at 11:45am EST\n\nPain in T(he)|X\n\nAs recounted previously, after much hemming and hawing I bought a discounted Palm T|X PDA. When I upgraded from my priginal Palm III to a Handera 330, the move was almost completely painless. When I upgraded from the 330 to a Palm Tungsten T3, there was extended wailing and gnashing of teeth. Now that I am upgrading from the T3 to the TX, I am reliving the pain I relived three years ago.\n\nThis is where I believe that Palm really fell down on the job. If somebody is going to put their entire life in a device, they should have some assurance they will be able to get their life out of the device if necessary. I recognize that it is necessary for a company like Palm to move constantly forward, but each time they have done so it seems like they have done it to attract new people to their fold, and not to retain the people they already have.\n\nThis has always been visible in the way they forced users to purchase all new accessories (down to the type of stylus nearly every time they upgraded hardware. The constant shift in form factors and connectors meant that you couldn't just buy a new machine, you had to rebuild your entire environment. There was also a constant shift in operating system and database structure, forcing users to upgrade their software applications. Application developers mimicked this, making it difficult to transfer applications you had purchased from one device to another.\n\nIt took me months to repair the damage to my databases that was caused by my 330 to T3 move. I expect the time frame to be similar for this latest move. The only upside to the apparent death of Palm is that theoretically the next time I move, it will be away from Palm OS entirely.\n\n2007.11.29 at 10:30am EST\n\nFriday Cublogging\n\nMy Cube Name Tag\n\nIn case you can't tell what they did here, they took a cube sign that had only one T in my first name, and fixed it by applying a T peeled from another sign. I have been here three months. The delivered the incorrect sign a week or two ago, and this version just appeared this morning.\n\n2007.11.30 at 10:00am EST\n\nDeaths in the family\n\nI didn't post this sooner because, well, it seems weird to be posting such stuff to a blog that is normally pretty frivolous. Last week my sweetie's father passed away. We were there when he died, and it was peaceful, for which we are thankful. He knew a lot of people, both through his life and his internet correspondence, so the amount of support that has been coming in for his family has been tremendous. Many thanks to you all who have expressed sympathy.\n\nAfter his obituary was published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the news staff decided to write a longer article about him and his life. If you weren't privileged to know him well, I hope those two things help you realize what a great character is now missing from the world.\n\nThen, as if that weren't enough, Marshall's fiancee Linda also lost her son, who had also been ill for some time. Will was another great character, and another good friend. Sharon refers to him as her step-brother, and he certainly treated us like family.\n\nLast week was very sad for us, so I hope you're all wearing your seatbelts and eating healthy foods.\n\n2007.11.03 at 12:00am EST\n\nT|Xation Without Representation\n\nI suppose I owe you all an update on this very important issue. What I wound up doing was hard-resetting the T|X, then moving databases over one by one from the T3. This was accomplished by beaming when possible (using the Applications Launcher, FileZ, and T'Catalog), or restoring individual databases from an SD card backup of the T3. I needed to use a small utility called \"ChangeName\" on the T|X to set the Hotsync name without Hotsyncing, but other than that things went smoothly if slowly.\n\nPictures in the Palm photo app were the biggest pain, since the database format appears to have changed. The desktop software probably would have handled that better, but I still don't have the desktop software working right. Last night, I tried to fix it by setting all my conduits to \"handheld overwrites desktop\" (a cumbersome process that has been cumbersome since 1998 at least), but that hung up in my calendar and I killed it in the morning.\n\nWhat I'll probably wind up doing is uninstalling the desktop application, and reinstalling it from scratch. Bleargh.\n\nAnyway, the T|X is an OK machine. I'm really missing the vibrating alert, and hated having to buy another charge/sync cable. I don't like how the status bar doesn't have a home button on it any more, and don't like how it's been moved to a hard button. I don't need a hard button for the web browser, either, since the WiFi has trouble connecting to encrypted networks (most of the networks I use).\n\nIt seems that some WiFi routers simply take too long to assign IP addresses, and the Palm is timing out, but I can't find a timeout value anywhere. I can connect quickly to open networks, and almost as quickly to lightly encrypted networks, but networks with full 104/128 bit encryption most often don't work. I can connect at home about half the time. When it works, it's nice to be able to browse web stuff and fetch new email on the go, though.\n\nOver the weekend I was hanging out with a bunch of people who all had iPhones, and their connectivity wasn't much better than mine, all told. They could use Google maps, but the network was so slow it wasn't very useful. I did better by taking screen captures at home before the trip and putting them on a memory card. It was also pretty funny watching people copy down each other's information between iPhones. No ability to beam information? Even to email you have to get the person's address somehow. Maybe somebody will write a quick Bluetooth beamer application once Apple allows you to put your own programs on your device.\n\nOk, so I've managed to get pretty far afield. Anyway, I've been annoyed with my PDA upgrade, but I'm managing to get it worked out and it's been better than the last time. Also, I'm glad I still have a Palm and not an iPhone.\n\n2007.12.05 at 4:30pm EST\n\nLet It Snow\n\nIt's time for my annual rant on the topic of snow.\n\nPlease, out of consideration for everyone else on the road, clean as much snow and ice as possible off your vehicle before driving it anywhere.\n\nFirst of all, it doesn't blow off as well as you think it does, particularly if it's two inches thick. Second, it does blow off some, into the windshields of everybody behind you, decreasing visibility on an already problematic day. Third, you look like a freaking idiot and I hate you.\n\nFunniest I ever saw was after we'd had a snow storm followed by an ice storm, so three inches of snow all had a hard crust. Guy was driving a car down the highway when enough wind got under the sheet of ice on his hood to lift it off the snow in one complete sheet and send it flying up into the air. Idiot must have thought his hood flew off and he was about to get somebody killed. Luckily for all of us the ice sliced offf onto the shoulder. I pulled up next to him to look over and his face was gray like death. I laughed and laughed. This could be you.\n\nIf your SUV is too tall for you clean off the roof, consider that you have bought a vehicle too freaking large for human scale living. that means that either you should get rid of it, or admit you are an inhuman monster of some kind.\n\n2007.12.06 at 12:00pm EST\n\nBoring Weekend\n\nFor once, a boring weekend. Some weekends, I'm travelling. Some weekends, I have events to attend. Some weekends, I have piles of stuff to do at home. Some weekends, thankfully, are boring, and I jealously guard them and enforce their dreariness.\n\nThings got off to a good start on Friday with another snow storm that inspired me to work from home. Not leaving the house at all on Friday made Saturday extra special, so I didn't get out of bed until noon on Saturday. We did some babysitting for the nephews on Saturday night, which inspired some rushing around, but that was OK. On Sunday, the biggest news was that I got some shredding done to loosen things up in my filing cabinet. Shredding! Yippee.\n\nAnother thing I did to empty some space was to clean up my tax records. My standard operating procedure when I finish filing my taxes is to gather everything up that I used to prepare them, put it all in a folder, and put that folder in my files. This sounds like a good plan except it includes all kinds of stuff I will never ever need, like envelopes, instructions books, extra copies of forms, etcetera. Just pulling all the old instruction books saved me about four inches of drawer space.\n\nIf me posting in pride about three inches of drawer space doesn't impress upon you the ponderous nature of my weekend, I don't know what will.\n\n2007.12.10 at 10:00am EST\n\n\"Wolf Who Rules\" Q's\n\nI finished reading this book over the weekend, and I have a couple of questions from the very end.\n\nWhat happened to Esme?\n\nThe rim intersects the Squirrell Hill Tunnels?\n\nIf any of you, my readers, can answer, please send me email.\n\n2007.12.10 at 1:00pm EST\n\nSick\n\nUgh.\n\n2007.12.11 at 9:00am EST\n\nStill Sick\n\nI definitely feel better today than I did at this time yesterday, but I also felt worse waking up this morning than I did waking up yesterday.\n\n2007.12.12 at 10:00am EST\n\nRosemary Chicken with Potatoes\n\nIngredients\n\n1 boneless, skinned chicken breast per person\n\n1 potato per person, plus an extra potato\n\n2 lemon slices per chicken breast\n\n1 sprig of fresh rosemary per chicken breast\n\n1/2 cup chicken broth\n\n1/2 cup lemon juice\n\n1/2 cup white wine\n\n1 teaspoon arrowroot or other starch mixed with water\n\nProcedure\n\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees Farenheit.\n\nSlice the potatoes into 1/4 inch slices and brown them (both sides) in oil. It's fastest if you use multiple frying pans for this step. Make sure at least one of them is oven-safe with a cover. remove slices to paper towel to drain when done.\n\nPound chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness, and roll each around a spring of rosemary. You can also add a sprinkle of sage inside before rolling, if you have it. Sear the breasts in oil to lock them into their rolled shape.\n\nDrain almost all the oil from the oven-safe pan and cover the bottom with potato slices. Place the browned chicken breasts on top of the potatoes and top each with a couple of slices of lemon.\n\nMix liquids and pour into bottom of pan. Cover, and bake in oven for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the chicken is fully cooked.\n\nPour the starch liquid into the remaining pan liquid and swirl the pan around to mix it. Allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes while the food cools a little bit.\n\nServe each chicken breast on a plate next to 8 to 10 slices of potato. Spoon thickened sauce from pan over chicken and potatoes. Opinions vary on whether eating the rosemary is a good idea, but watch out for the twig at the center.\n\nEnjoy! I make this recipe at home three or four times a year. It's kind of a pain with all the frying, but it's tasty.\n\n2007.12.13 at 12:00am EST\n\nFriday Assblogging\n\nRudely Parked 'Patriot'\n\nThe ass who owns and drives this Jeep Patriot parks like this quite often in the lot at work. It's a pet peeve of mine, so here's some public shame. After I took this picture, somebody wrote \"BAD PARKER\" in the dust on the back window and it was like that for days.\n\n2007.12.14 at 3:00pm EST\n\nMore Politics\n\nIt's fashionable among some groups of people to view the US government as a wolf at the throat of the American people. Those people want to rule the US as a republic like Rome, but the US is supposed to be a democracy. The government is supposed to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is not the government; it is our government. Our government is more like a dog than a wolf, and you don't make friends with a dog by starving the beast.\n\n2007.12.17 at 5:00am EST\n\nDear Eeyore\n\nA friend of mine once told me that when most women talk to others about their problems what they want is sympathy, and that when most men talk about their problems what they want is advice. This leads to complications as women talk to men hoping for sympathy and and receive what they perceive as \"being told what to do.\" I don't know how true or untrue this is in general, but with me specifically I know that I compuslively respond with advice, and have to remember to voice my sympathy. I'm not sure if that comes off any better.\n\n\"Gosh, that really sucks. (How do you actually communicate sympathy?) I remember when this vaguely similar thing happened to me how much that sucked, so I know what it's like to have something suck, and that sucks. (Too much information? Trying to even the emotional field here? This isn't some kind of competition. More honest sympathy needed.) I'm really sorry to hear this sucky thing is happened to you. (Not exactly sympathetic, but indicates I'm trying.) [Pause for one breath or drink.] (Whew, interpersonal obligations fulfilled, now for the advice.) Here's the first thing I can think of to solve the situation. (Gosh you should have figured that out for yourself.)\"\n\nSee what I mean? The heart wants to help heal, but the brain wants to help solve and sometimes it sounds like the asshole. Life is hard.\n\n2007.12.18 at 11:00am EST\n\nContracting\n\nRight now I'm working as an independant contractor. This has pluses and minuses. One of the minuses is that I only get paid for hours I spend actually working. That means that if my uberboss takes the group out for a holiday lunch, and the lunch takes two hours, and I don't feel like working late to make up for it, this lunch costs me an hour's pay. I hate to seem ungrateful for a free lunch, but this lunch was very expensive, realistically speaking. Nice chatting with my coworkers, though.\n\n2007.12.19 at 3:00pm EST\n\nDisturbing Dream\n\nIn the dream, I'm standing outside, in front of what is vaguely my parents house. Across the street, standing on the porch of a house (which is not the actual house across the street from my parents) were a bunch of kids. There were about six kids, plus one of them was holding a baby. Suddenly, the kid with the baby dashes across the street. Speeding cars whiz in front of and behind the kid, but he makes it across just fine. The kid stops, turns around, and runs back across the street. Faster than I can gasp my dismay, he makes it back through traffic, and I am relieved, but then as he climbs the steps onto the porch, he drops the baby.\n\nThe baby starts screaming, of course. One of the girls picks up the baby and runs back to my side of the street. At this point I'm starting to wonder what's going on here, but at least they got the baby away from that reckless boy. Then, the girl holding the baby also drops it. She's short so it doesn't fall far, but it lands on its head and then rolls over onto its back. I rush over to see if it's OK.\n\nThe baby has stopped screaming, but it's lying there on its back looking up at me. I see now that the baby is battered and misshapen. I'm disgusted by the crimes, but repulsed by the victim. One of the kids says, \"You should try this.\" He reaches out with two fingers and presses on the baby's head, which makes a nauseating squishing sound.\n\nI grab the kid's hand and pull it away from the baby. \"No, you shouldn't do that. Leave it alone.\" The kid tries to do something else, and I wrestle him back from the baby. I turn to Sharon and begin to walk towards the house. \"We should call someone. I'm going to call the police.\" That's all I remember of the dream.\n\n2007.12.20 at 3:00pm EST\n\nFriday Barblogging\n\nThe Afterparty\n\n2007.12.21 at 11:00am EST\n\nKim Stanley Robinson's \"Sixty Days and Counting\"\n\nOne of these days, I'm going to figure out why I keep reading books by Kim Stanley Robinson. Okay, I enjoy reading his books. They're not very good novels though, in that the plot (if it exists) is not central to the book. The situations and characters of all his books are well constructed and described, but then the course of each book is more or less just a chain of things that happen. This book is the third 500 page volume of a trilogy, and I can't even tell which character delivers the last line of dialog. Yet, I will probably buy \"The Galileans\" (his work in progress) when it comes out.\n\nHis books, I guess, are like real life. Things happen, you can't tell what's good or bad, but you just make guesses and listen to what other people say. The plots (if they exist) are so much larger than the characters that you can only infer their existence from where they intersect the lives of the characters, and not directly observe them.\n\nI guess I keep reading because I so desperately want to know if he's a bad writer who just rants and rambles, or a good writer who is simply too nuanced for me to understand. I find it difficult to recommend him to others, though.\n\n2007.12.26 at 4:00pm EST\n\nSanta Surprise\n\nI am a horrible gift shopper, so for Sharon's holiday gifts I try to start as early as possible. Hopefully, I'm mostly done by the end of November. Then, I wrap everything up so that if she goes into my supply closet for something she won't accidentally glimpse her presents.\n\nOver the course of the next month, I forget the content of about half of these wrapped presents. Sometimes Sharon will say to me in December, \"Well, if you didn't get me such-and-such, I'll buy it after Newyears. I can only smile sweetly and mysteriously, because even I don't know if I bought that or not.\n\nWhen she opens her preents, it's as much for my benefit as for hers. \"Yipee, I did get you that.\"\n\n2007.12.28 at 1:00pm EST\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nThree in a Bowl\n\n2007.12.28 at 6:30pm EST\n\nNew Year Wrap-Up\n\nWelcome to a brand new year here at \"Nothing In It\". I can't say I am sorry to see 2007 go. I have some worries about 2008, but let's take it one day at a time.\n\nMy first few months of posting here have been interesting. I've made a real effort to put up something every business day, even if it's a cheap cop-out of some kind. After watching webcomics and other blogs for years, I knew it wouldn't be easy. My record so far has been fairly successful, well into the B-grade.\n\nIn 2008, you can hopefully look forward to more project posting. I just completed a polar fleece hoodie for Sharon (new pattern!) and a set of curtains for my home office. I also still have some projects from last year that still need complete documentation, so that's a few more posts right there. I've also watched a few good movie lately, and I can't stop reading books, so expect more discussion along those lines.\n\nAnyway, I hope you had a good holiday. Mine was relaxing. I hope you'll keep reading. Thanks.\n\n2008.01.02 at 12:00pm EST\n\nReview of \"World War Z\" by Max Brooks\n\nI didn't buy this author's first zombie-related book, \"The Zombie Survival Guide\", as it was one of a spate of books attempting to follow the success of \"The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook\", which I enjoyed too immensely. This book, subtitled, \"An Oral History of the Zombie War\", is a totally different beast, and definitely worth a read.\n\nTaking the form of a series of interviews, the book builds an overall story through brief snippets of information. You get to see the history of the overall war and its phases from so many different angles that it's difficult to get bored. Brooks wants you to see the story of the outbreak as a world event, and through his disjoint storytelling I think he succeeds. The overall story itself is also involving, drawing you into the minute details of a zombie invasion as incidental mentions and unusual experiences.\n\nIt's clear that Brooks really thought his idea through, exploring aspects and implications of a zombie event that I'd never seen discussed elsewhere. Beyond the first few days of a zombie invasion as covered by most work, Brooks covers years of effects, both personal and socio-political. The scale he's discussing goes from one person's story, to one nation's story, to a global story. It's convincing and I found it engrossing.\n\n2008.01.00 at 12:00am EST\n\nShocking Experience\n\nI really hate being cold, so I tend to wear a lot of clothing in the winter. all these layers generate a lot of static electricity, so I'm used to receiving shocks from just about everything I touch. The other day I went to pour out the remains of yesterday's soft drink, and when the stream of liquid joined the metal can in my hand to the metal sink, pow! That's a new one on me.\n\n2008.01.04 at 12:00am EST\n\nThree Good Things About Going to the Movies This Weekend\n\nThe Movie: Sweeney Todd\n\nTim Burton continues to make gutsy movies that entertain while engendering a definite uneasiness. This movie is way gorier than I even expected, but somehow still watchable. Many people will hold up Johnny Depp, but Todd's character in this is perhaps the least interesting. Helena Boham Carter's meat pie lady has many more layers; she's the real star here. The film is not too long, and the pacing drives inexorably to the horrific end. This film will be a favorite of the Gothic crowd for decades, but everybody should see this wonderful rendition of a Sondheim classic.\n\nThe Amenities: This Theatre Has a Bar\n\nWhat more can I say? It's a serviceable bar. In the same building. If you pay extra, you can walk right from the bar into the upper seats of the theatres holding your drink, but even a general admission ticket lets you upstairs before the show. It sure beats trying to meet up with your companions inside the dark theatre, and it's suprisingly free of advertising in there, which I cannot say about the lobby.\n\nThe Pre-Show: Not Boring\n\nWhen did studios start producing the \"no smoking, no talking, no phones, etc.\" announcements before the film as advertisements for their upcoming films? Since I'm sitting there expecting film advertising, this doesn't bother me, and it's prefereable to the service announcements theaters used to buy from stock houses or have produced once and use for the next twenty years. Now, can we stop with the truck commercials and TV promos?\n\n2008.01.00 at 12:00am EST\n\nNew Windshield\n\nThe man from Safelite replacing my windshield\n\nNormally, any kind of car service is a dreadful pain. When the windshield of my car sprouted a crack several weeks ago, I put off doing anything about it because I anticipated having to drop off my car at a body shop and leave it there for two or three days. Eventually, enough people told me to call my insurance company about it that that's what I did.\n\nI knew it was the right choice when the automated system said, \"Press 1 if your claim is related to the glass in your automobile.\" From there, I basically answered a bunch of questions from a customer service representative and set up an appointment for a person to drive out to my workplace and replace the windshield in the parking lot.\n\nRead that again! Why isn't more auto service like this? It really was sweet. When the guy arrived at my workplace, he called me on my phone and I went outside to show him to my car. I unlocked it, and he did the rest. When he was finished, he called me again, I went back outside, signed some paperwork, paid my deductible, and I was done. Done!\n\nDoes anybody do oil changes this way? Maybe in the middle of the night while dressed as a ninja? Ninjiffy lube?\n\n2008.01.08 at 10:00am EST\n\n\"A Pair of Eboshi\" project added\n\nBack in September, I made a pair of Japanese eboshi caps. Medieval Japanese of middle and upper classes rarely went about with their heads uncovered. In modern times, it's often inconvenient to wear a helmet or formal hat of some kind, so most people I know wear eboshi. These even make good \"liners\" for actual hats or helmets (not that I wear a kabuto).\n\nI've needed these for a while to complete my outfits, so it's good to finally have them, although they make my ears stick out.\n\n2007.10.31 at 12:00am EDT\n\nGarage Translation\n\nI have to admit that in my own professional life, I suck at estimating how long something will take. When observing other people's failures in this area (always easier than analyzing your own failures) a frequent source of data is the garage I take my car to for service.\n\nTo be honest, I love this place. They do good work, they're conveniently located, and stuff they fix stays fixed. They're maybe a little expensive, but they're honest (as far as I can tell) and the rest is worth it to me. They even go a little out of their way for you (squeezing you in the schedule, doing disgnostics for free sometimes, etc.) if they know and like you.\n\nThat said, they suck at estimating time.\n\nWhat they estimate How long it takes 10 minutes 20 minutes 15 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour half a day 3 or 4 hours all day\n\nNow I realize that sometimes the schedule gets changed due to unforeseen accidents, squeezing in people they like, and such, but it's so consistent that it seems like they should catch on. If they have caught on and they still underestimate, well that's pretty much lying. It's the only thing I've caught them being dishonest about, so it sticks out, you know?\n\nOn other things, they're super honest. Like, if I call up and ask if they could do something change for me or something on a day they're busy, they tell me \"no.\" Usually that means I wait a day or two and try again, but some people would just go someplace else, and I respect the garage for taking that risk by being honest. Anyway, this bit me today so I'm posting about it.\n\n2007.01.10 at 4:00pm EST\n\nFriday Assblogging\n\nRudely Parked 'H3'\n\nThis is the first time I've seen this H3 parked like an ass, but something about the H3 screams \"ass\" to begin with, so even minor violations are like hanging an ASS billboard off your vehicle. Why do people even buy these imitation Humvees anyway? I mean, at least a real \"Hummer\" has a certain \"Up yours\" vibe to it that demand respect. The H3 just has that \"poser\" vibe like people in the midwest who dress like surfers.\n\n2008.01.11 at 12:00am EST\n\nParentheses\n\nWhy do people still use parentheses in phone numbers? You know, like \"(412) 555-1212\"? Does anybody still live in a region where area codes are optional? Haven't ten digit numbers been mandatory in most areas for something like ten years? It's an obsolete, archaic usage! It makes you seem like an old person, like that guy who used to write editorials for The Onion who would hyphen-ate words like \"auto-mobile\" to make himself seem olde-timey.\n\nStop. If you want, we can argue about whether phone numbers should be broken into sections by hyphens or by dots, but this is non-negotiable.\n\n2008.01.14 at 12:00am EST\n\n\"Suito\" project page updated\n\nAfter cleaning and finishing a bottle gourd for use as a \"Suito\" Japanese drinking gourd at Pennsic, I couldn't even make it the whole time without breaking the thing. Scroll down to the bottom for a few pictures of the wreckage.\n\n2008.01.15 at 12:00am EST\n\nAFAIKIATFTS\n\nAs far as I know, I am the first to say \"MacBook Err\".\n\nJust trying to raise the blood pressure of all the Apple fans.\n\n2008.01.15 at 5:00pm EST\n\n\"Batik Drapes\" project page added\n\nI made some new drapes for the room I use as an office. After searching in vain for some nice drapes it's nice to just be able to find some fabirc and make some and have done with it. I'm not thrilled with these, but they're nice.\n\nTo paraphrase a friend of mine, \"I don't know how people who can't sew manage to get through life.\"\n\n2008.01.16 at 12:00am EST\n\n\"Hoodies\" project page added\n\nI wanted to be able to make hoodies, so I got a pattern for making hoodies, and now I can make hoodies, until the end of time, or when the supply of hoodie, fabric runs out.\n\n2008.01.17 at 12:00am EST\n\nI Have Returned\n\nSpent a week on vacation, during which I decided not to post here at all. We were in a hotel with wireless, so I probably could have, but if I'd even started up my computer I would have gotten distracted ripping CDs and burning DVDs, so it's unclear I would have gotten around to posting. Was that mysterious?\n\nMost of the week was spent at Arisia. It's been a while since I've been to Boston, so we made time for socializing and visiting family. At Arisia, I spent a bunch of time helping my friend Eric with his 'Fan performance Guest of Honor' duties, but I found some time for doing regular Con stuff and relaxing at parties.\n\n(Private to MC: Chaya says hello. Full conversation included obligatory \"Do you know\", \"Of course I know\" sequence familiar to Pittsburghers on vacation but always so surprising to outsiders.)\n\nAnyway, rent a copy of \"Jadesoturi\" (aka: Jade Warrior) if you're looking for a good Finnish kung-fu film. I'm not kidding. This film is more \"thinking person's wuxia\" that some people can't stand, but of course I thought it was great.\n\nI shot about five hours of video for Eric to edit, so fans of his \"Eric in the Elevator\" talk show have quite a bit to look forward to.\n\n2008.01.24 at 12:00pm EST\n\nFriday Ericblogging\n\nEric interviews Art GoH Marrus\n\nThe elevators at the Hyatt where Arisia is held are too narrow and fragile for extended filming, so the convention built Eric an \"Elevator\" set in the lobby just behind the elevators themselves. In this picture, Eric finally gets to interview the real Marrus following a practical joke. The cue card chick requests applause.\n\n2008.01.25 at 10:30am EST\n\nBest Laid Plans\n\nPittsburgh's curbside recycling program employs a \"blue bag\" system. Supermarkets bag your groceries with blue plastic bags, and you put your recyclables in these bags and leave them out at the curb every other trash day to be picked up by a separate recycling crew.\n\nThis January, the recycling program was greatly expanded in our part of the city. Instead of just accepting newspaper, cans, and plastics 1-5; we can recycle cardboard, office paper, catalogs, and paperboard. This is all \"single stream\" and doesn't have to be separated (which is convenient), and can just all be shoved together in the same blue bags.\n\nThe difficulty comes in that we already have a small problem with recyclables piling up in our home. Recycling collection is still every two weeks, so with this expansion of the program our storage requirements have also increased. Typically, by the end of a two week period our recycling bin was already overflowing w with bottles and cans.\n\nWe worried about this for a bit until we noticed that the brochure for the program [PDF] said, \"Place in blue bags only (or Place in bright blue containers clearly marked 'Recycling').\" We could get a blue recycling can, and store recyclables in the garage instead of the kitchen, then just wheel the bin outside on recycling day.\n\nSo of course the regular trash guys, who go through the neighborhood before the recycling crew, just dumped our big bin of recyclables into the garbage truck. Yay environmentalism! I called the recycling Division of the Bureau of Environmental Services to ask about this, and was told the blue container mention in the brochure was a red herring. All recyclables should be placed outside in blue bags, except for cardboard which can be simply flattened and tied with string (not simple, by the way). We could use a blue container to store full blue bags, and could possibly put a blue container full of blue bags out for the recycling crew to empty, but the person on the phone wouldn't recommend it.\n\nSo yay. Yay for people who don't mean what they write, and yay for people who don't tell anybody what they mean. Yay for people who don't know what they're supposed to do, and yay for people who don't do what they're supposed to. Yay for people who clearly mean well but have a hard time figuring out how to actually accomplish things. Yay.\n\n2008.01.28 at 11:00am EST\n\nInquiring Minds\n\nAccording to my http access logs, 7% of the visitors who are directed to my web site by search engines only want to know one thing: How to play Sorry.\n\n2008.01.29 at 11:59pm EST\n\nPower\n\nSo I woke up this morning at about 5am to a loud clunk outside, and I noticed the power was out. High winds here in Pittsburgh today. (It was supposed to be snowy, so I'll take it.)\n\nAnyway, luckily we have a gas-powered hot water heater, a gas stove, a stove-top coffee maker, and battery-powered alarm clocks. I also liked having a battery powered radio for my morning news and liked having the big flashlight so she could see. (I can see in very dim light.)\n\n2008.01.30 at 10:00am EST\n\nAmazed\n\nI'm always amazed when I say something that I think is mildly amusing, and the people I'm talking to erupt with wild laughter.\n\n2008.01.31 at 12:00am EST\n\nShredding\n\nOver the weekend, I turned another pile of old documents into confetti as part of my continuing efforts to pare down my files from eight drawers to four. The question that ran through my mind most often was not, \"Why do I still have this stuff?\" but, \"Why did I ever keep this stuff?\"\n\nI actually shredded a stack of statements from a checking account that I not only closed more than a dozen years ago, but was at a bank that no longer exists. Good riddance!\n\nMy new method for storing files has a two step approach. Step one is scan all bills and statements into my computer. Step two is place scanned documents into yearly folders. If I need to look something up, the scans are named for searchability. When it's time to destroy old documents I can pull a single folder for shredding instead of having to dig through a dozen account-specific folders.\n\nMy biggest problem now is going through the 10 inches or so of stuff that has stacked up in my desktop letter tray. Most of it is packed into a big box at this point, but I really need to sit down and go through it to figure out what needs to stay and what needs to go.\n\nFinally, if you're looking for a good shredder, I'm liking my Fellowes DS-1. It's shredded everything I've run through it, and has some style to it. A big bonus is that the output bin can be emptied without having to lift the shredding unit off the top of it like my old shredder. That old one's dead by the way. The moral of that story is that even if the envelope says \"blessings of Jesus on whoever opens this envelope\" on the outside, feeding the entire envelope (unopened) through the shredder is probably an overreaction.\n\n2008.02.04 at 11:00am EST\n\nNeologism\n\nSyllotape - A notional adhesive tape, used for joining two or more apparently separate arguments or lines of logical thinking, or for patching a flawed argument.\n\nThis joke (like \"Spellotape\" in Harry Potter) is funnier if you know that \"Sellotape\" is the most popular brand of transparent adhesive tape in the United Kingdom.\n\n2008.02.04 at 1:30pm EST\n\nYesterday's Lesson\n\nJust because your fully loaded trailer slid into the loading bay no problem (when it was fully loaded) doesn't mean that (after unloading) it won't break the head off a fire sprinkler on the way out.\n\nThose who know me well know that this is the second time I've had to evacuate a building due to somebody breaking the head off a fire sprinkler. At least this time I was dressed.\n\n2008.02.05 at 1:00pm EST\n\nMore Politics\n\nLook, I already voted for Hillary Clinton once, and I wasn't happy with the way it turned out. I remember saying to somebody in 1992, \"If the only way to get a smart woman into the White House is to vote for her slimy husband, I'm all for it.\" The next eight years were pretty good economically, and very exciting technologically, but politically they kinda sucked. Bill Clinton signed more crappy laws (DMCA, NAFTA, CDA) than I like to think about, and I remember him specifically declining to veto them, regardless of the fact he disagreed with them. Political mishandling set back progressive causes (like health care and workers rights) for more than a decade instead of moving them forward.\n\nThis is not to say I would vote for any of the people the Republicans are proposing to run, but I really would prefer to not vote for Hillary again.\n\n2008.02.00 at 12:00am EST\n\nTEH AWSUM!\n\nI don't do a lot of linking on this blog, but this image is teh awsum!\n\nA candidate both LOLpublicicans and LOLocrats can be proud of.\n\n2008.02.07 at 10:00am EST\n\nVideo List\n\nWinter.

Oh no, it looks like I need a new house key.\n\nYesterday, I noticed that my key ring sounds different. I never noticed that I'd gotten used to the way my key ring sounds, but it makes sense, I guess. I makes me wonder how many key ring \"signatures\" my brain has memorized, and how many I could identify just from the sound.\n\n2008.02.12 at 12:00am EST\n\n100\n\nThis is the 100th post to this blog.

For those of you not familiar with this work, Dhalgren is one of those famously difficult pieces of fiction loosely labelled as SF, and often called a masterpiece. It seems like very few people have the patience to work their way through the 890 pages of writing to form an opinion. I've gotten pretty good at grinding my way through difficult works (loved Neal Stephenson's \"Baroque Cycle\"), so I thought I'd give it a shot. I don't yet have an opinion. Usually, it takes me a few weeks to completely digest a work of this type, read some criticism and commentary, and formulate a conclusion. Right now I don't know if it's a masterpiece, and can't say for sure it's fiction let alone SF.\n\nIt is, I am confident in saying, a remarkably effective book. By this, I mean it affects the reader. It stimulates moods and thought patterns in a way most fiction does not, at least not in me. Fear, confusion, lust, horror, anger, fondness, sorrow, were all clearly communicated to me and caused to form in me. This can be good and exciting, or troubling. Regardless, it is impressive. What's lacking right now is understanding.\n\nWhat is Delany trying to say with this work? Is it fiction, or an extensive riff on the theme of identity? If it's fiction, what is the story \"about\"? For that matter, what is \"the story\"?\n\nA friend of mine who's had his literary abilities all-but-documented by the academy referred to Delany as \"apparently the real thing\", so I'm willing to trust the both of them far enough to say Dleany is clearly doing something deliberate here. I guess it's my job to figure out what. Difficult works demand more from the reader. It's one of the reasons I enjoy reading them. Sure is hard work, though.\n\n2008.02.13 at 12:00am EST\n\nSnow Rant #2\n\nIt's time for my other annual rant on the topic of snow. Once again, it's all about being considerate to other people.\n\nParking between the lines is one of the things that separates us from the animals. Even during the LA riots in 1992, when people would drive to a store in order to loot it, they parked between the lines in the parking lot. Why you feel a little snow should give you just cause to park like a barbarian is totally beyond me.\n\nHere's what I do: before I pull into a spot, I put my car in park and get out. Then, I use the heel of my shoe to scrape a trench in the snow until I find two lines that define a parking spot. Then, I park between those lines. Thus, even during an extreme weather event, I maintain my humanity.\n\nAgain, this is about consideration to other people who have to use the same parking lot. People who know me know that (in general) I am not a \"law and order\" type, so this insistence on rigidly following the imposed grid system might seem contradictory, but it is not about obeying commands, but observing the social contract and being efficient in the use of resources.\n\nIn a civil society, we try to be fair to our fellows. Parking in more than one spot signifies that your convenience (parking quickly and without having to spend extra time in the cold) is worth more to you than mine (I have to park farther away because all the closer spots are occupied by randomly parked cars).\n\nIn a rational society, we try to make efficient use of our resources. If there are 100 convenient parking spaces, filling them with fewer than 100 cars is a waste. If everybody parked randomly we'd need bigger parking lots, and have fewer grassy meadows.\n\nPlease, think of others and think of the world when it's snowing and you pull into a parking lot. I know it's probably taken you twice as long to get there in the first place, but spend a little more time and be kind. thanks.\n\n2008.02.14 at 12:00am EST\n\n\"Atonement\" & \"No Country for Old Men\"\n\nDid some catching up on the movies-in-theatres front this week as well, seeing two very interesting and disquieting movies.\n\nThe first was Atonement, a film set just before and during World War II that details the disruption of life caused by a girl misunderstanding everal things at once. It is essentially a disquisition on the subject of storytelling. The purpose of storytelling is being explored, and how this purpose can be revealed or obscured by the style the storyteller uses. Sometimes, a film will be criticised with the instruction, \"Show me, don't tell me.\" People who don't understand that criticism should be forced to watch this film. It is at once stark and lush. It is sparse and economical in its dialog and exposition, but lavish in its use of symbolism, visuals, and editing. I can see myself watching this movie at least three more times, trying to dig further into it, not because it is confusing (the story is simple and told clearly) but because it is told so well I want to be sure I'm seeing every aspect of it I'm supposed to see.\n\nThe second was No Country for Old Men, a Coen brothers film set (inexplicably and unexplainedly) in 1980. Again, there's plenty of symbolism here I just don't understand, but it's almost incidental. The chief trick the Coens pull on the viewer is that despite who the story begins and ends with, and despite who it mostly follows, the story is about the man in the middle. I have to admire Tommy Lee Jones for his work on this role. His job here was to portray a man who is starting to feel \"too old\", and he allows the filmmakers to show his face in such close ups and with so little concealement that he looks \"too old\". The film treats the landscape and other settings with the same uncompromising glare as it treats that face. Age, dirt, wear, and clutter are shown in sharp lines and colors. Really, the story here is not as pointed. There's a short voice-over at one point that explains it, but you won't remember what he said by the time the end comes. Look it up on the IMDB quotes page.\n\n2008.02.15 at 11:00am EST\n\nQuote from \"Dhalgren\"\n\n\"[ ]You know the world is round, and that the moon is a small world circling it. But you live in a world of up and down, where the land is a surface. But for me, just the visual continuity from that flat surface to a height where the edge of the earth develops a curve, to where that curve is a complete circle, to where the little soap-colored circle hanging in front of you enlarges to the size the Earth was, and then you come down. And suddenly that circle is a surface -- but up and down is already not quite the same thing. We danced when we got out on the moon. What else could we do with that lightness? You know, seeing a film backward isn't the same experience as seeing it forward in reverse. It's a new experience, still happening forward in time. What falls out is all its own. Returning from the moon was not the same as going, played backward. We Arrived at a place where no one had walked; we left a place where we had danced. The earth we left was peopled by a race that had never sent emissaries to another cosmological body. We returned to a people who had. I really feel that what we did was important--folks starving in India not withstanding; and if there's a real threat of world starvation, technology will have to be used to avoid it; and I can't think of a better way to let people know just how far technology can take us.[ ]\"\n\n-- Captain Kamp in Dhalgren by Samuel R.

It's a professional level package for document production the way Photoshop is the professional level package for imageediting. There are others, but this one is still the best. It has its problems, but it is still the best.\n\nOne of it's problems (in my opinion) is that it saves the zoom level you've selected in the file. This is handy if you're the sole person working on the file, but since FrameMaker actually facilitates group work it's more common that somebody else will have to see this file at some point. Saving it at 120% zoom so you can read it while leaving back in your chair or saving it at 75% so you can see the whole page are both pains for the next person if their favored zoom is different.\n\nSo here's my tip. FrameMaker has a setting for \"Monitor Size\" in its General Preferences. This preference is used to scale the document so that when documents are viewed on the screen at 100%, one inch on the screen is actually one inch long. This is nice, but essentially useless for most people since if you really care about dimensions you'll be looking at the numbers for those dimensions, and not measuring with a ruler. This preference is saved for the user, not in the file. What I recommend is that you always work and save at 100% zoom, then set the Monitor Size preference so that documents zoomed to 100% display at the size at which you like to work. In this case, smaller monitor size settings yield higher zoom levels.\n\nThis method has its problems too, but it should resolve the \"zoom wars\" issue some work groups have when using FrameMaker.\n\n2008.02.19 at 12:00am EST\n\nStephen Brust's \"My Own Kind of Freedom\"\n\nStephen Brust, author of two dozen novels or so, including the long running Dragaera series that includes the Vlad Taltos novels, has written a novel that's a Firefly fanfic. If you're a Brust fan and a Firefly fan you must read this. If you're a Brust fan but not a Firefly fan you should probably skip this. If you're a Firefly fan but have no idea who Brust is, you should pretend it says Joss Whedon or Keith DeCandido (who did a good job on the Serenity novelization, I thought) and read this.\n\nThe story occurs after the series as it appears on DVD, but before the events of the film. Inara and Book have already left the ship. Whedon had envisioned several seasons worth of stories like this one occuring, so there's plenty of room. Brust manages to capture the rhythm of dialog, and the internal motivations of the characters. Maybe I'm just bringing that with me, but he manages not to jar my expectations.\n\nMany of the episodes were quality TV in that you could evaluate them not as individual works, but in their importance to the series. This novel isn't a 10.0 on that scale, but it establishes some good material for Mal, and deepens his character considerably. It also also establishes that the crew trust and follow Mal, but they do no idolize him and will disobey when they think he's wrong.\n\nAlso, Brust provides plenty of geek-out fodder, throwing in details and trivia as dialog.\n\nWhat the heck, it's free. Download and enjoy.\n\n2008.02.20 at 12:00am EST\n\nCan't Say I Never Win Anything\n\nThe little cafe down on the ground floor of the building in which I'm currently working on contract has a monthly drawing for a covered parking spot in the garage under the building. Every time you receipt totals $4 or more you can drop it in the bin, then every two weeks the previous winner draws a new receipt.\n\nAfter being here nearly six months and having lunch down in the cafe an average of about three times a week, my name was finally drawn. Starting Monday I get to park in a super-convenient covered spot for two weeks, which is just in time because starting Monday I only have two weeks left on my contract. (Employers in the Pittsburgh area please take note.)\n\n2008.02.21 at 12:00am EST\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nMischa the Bandit\n\nMischa Bandito, the bandit cat\n\nHe thinks that chicken is where it's at\n\nHe says he wants some, and that is that\n\nMischa the bandit cat\n\n(A week or so ago, Mischa got into a tussle with one of the other cats (most probably Tashi) and wound up with a big chunk of fur missing from his neck. Of course, he can't leave it alone and he scratches it bloody. Sharon tied this bandanna around his neck to keep him from doing so. It seems to be working. The bandanna is actually loose enough that he could pull it off if he really wanted to, but he's left it on for days. His neck is finally healing nicely.)\n\n2008.02.22 at 12:00am EST\n\nRudest Parker Ever\n\nOver the weekend, I saw the rudest parking job ever. Somebody at the Monroeville Office Depot (the one where the Sears Homelife used to be, next to the Gabe's where the Food4Less used to be) parked\n\nan H2\n\ncrooked\n\n3/4 of the way into\n\na handicap spot.\n\nThe only thing that kept me from having the store call the police was the extremely off chance that it was just somebody who had forgotten to put up their placard. I couldn't even take a picture of it because I didn't even want to have a reminder.\n\n2008.02.25 at 10:30am EST\n\nPoliTuesday: Senator Clinton\n\nI admire Senator Hillary Clinton greatly. I believe she's made some mistakes in the political process of attempting to effect progressive change in this country, but it's a difficult and expensive process, and plenty of people have made worse mistakes along it. I admire her dedication to pursuing the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, regardless of my voting plans. I believe that voting is about choice. I want to be forced to make a choice when I enter the voting booth, and too often all the candidates but one have dropped out by the time Pennsylvania gets to vote. Thank you, Senator Clinton for staying in the race and providing us all with a choice.\n\nIf Senator Clinton wants me to vote for her in April however, she is going to have to give me reasons to vote for her, not reasons why I should not vote for another. In my opinion, candidates should spend their time building up their own candidacy, not knocking down the candidacies of others. Senator Clinton has a lot to be proud of, and I have no problem with her reminding me of those things and telling me about the things she's like to accomplish in the future. However, I don't like seeing her belittling the accomplishments of others, and denigrating their expressions of hope.\n\nMy vote is something a politician must win from me, not drag away from another.\n\n2008.02.26 at 12:00am EST\n\nSick\n\nAgain.\n\n2008.02.27 at 9:00am EST\n\nConsolation\n\nMy Consolation\n\nStill sick, but being able to park under cover right next to the door into the ground floor lobby of the building is sure a consolation.\n\n2008.02.28 at 12:00pm EST\n\nFriday Catblogging\n\nDodger and Ethel\n\nThe truth is, Ethel is not Sharon's cat.

We have stairs at home, and I skip the elevator at work as a matter of principle. On the theory that repetition (\"reps\") promotes tone and endurance while exertion promotes strength, when I'm climbing I tend to go two steps at a time.\n\nIn addition to making the work harder, this produces a more normal walking pace, instead of the \"fast march\" of single step climbing. It's more of a glide up the stairs instead of a staccato dance. After a while, maybe ten years, double-stepping during ascension becomes natural and easy. (Double stepp"
