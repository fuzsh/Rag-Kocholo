        "text": "A trip from the capital to resort in the Carpathians, in \"Voevodyno\" takes about 8 hours. Of course, during this time you will want to rest, have a snack, and somehow distract yourself from the road. And why not combine all this with sightseeing? Many travelers like to get the most out of one trip and see as many interesting places as possible. If you are one of those tourists, then the road from Kyiv to Voevodyno will be to your liking!\n\nKorostyshiv canyon, Korostyshiv, Zhytomyr region\n\n50.314993 | 29.093094\n\nPhoto: Andrey Kosenko\n\nWe suggest making your first stop in one of the oldest Ukrainian cities. But one of the most beautiful local sights appeared here as a result of mineral development. It is about \"Granite Canyon\" - an artificial lake surrounded by rocky shores and a coniferous forest. The water here is incredibly clean due to the absence of sand. This place is so beautiful that many films and series were shot here, including the famous \"Storozhav Zastava\". All in all, a perfect place to stop.\n\nRuins of the Zviagel fortress, Novohrad-Volynskyi, Zhytomyr region\n\n50.593262 | 27.624367\n\nPhoto: Andrej Ter\n\nThis is the next interesting city on your trip. The ruins of the fortress, founded by Prince Ostrozki in the 16th century, have been preserved here. Most likely, by this point the children will be quite bored, but here they can have fun and come up with an exciting story about this fortress.\n\nKoretsky castle, Korets, Rivne region\n\n50.617384 | 27.156405\n\nPhoto: Andrij Pogrebnjak\n\nMost likely, you have not heard about the small town of Korets, and meanwhile it is included in the List of Historical Cities of Ukraine. You will see the tower of the Koret Castle from afar, at the entrance to the city. At first, the defensive structure was built of wood, and only in 1780 was it turned into a real fortress. The town also attracts tourists with a large number of ancient temples and churches.\n\nRivne Zoo, Rivne\n\n50.610273 | 26.330312\n\nPhoto: Taras Luschak\n\nThe zoo is located at the entrance to the city from the Kyiv side, so we couldn't help but include it in this list. The main part of its large area is the remains of an old orchard, so the place is very beautiful. Children will be delighted by more than 150 species of animals that live here, and parents will appreciate the opportunity to relax after several hours of driving.\n\nDubno castle, Dubno, Rivne region\n\n50.419301 | 25.74811\n\nPhoto: Alexander Korsar\n\nOnce this castle was considered one of the richest in all of Europe. Today, its wealth lies elsewhere - in history, culture and architecture. Unlike the previous locations, this castle is in excellent condition. Interesting excursions and exhibitions are held here. There is even a cinema and a cafe on the territory. You will definitely like the latter after a long drive.\n\nTyshkevych Palace, Brody, Lviv region\n\n50.086449 | 25.136633\n\nPhoto: Ira Kratiuk\n\nThe first place we recommend visiting in the Lviv region is Brody. Despite the small size of the settlement, there are many sights here: Brodiv Castle, the Church of the Holy Trinity, and the Church of St. George. But we especially recommend visiting the Tyshkevych Palace. This cute building is made in the style of classicism. There is a cozy square around, there is a pond. An excellent place for a short vacation.\n\nPidhoretski castle, Pidhortsi, Lviv region\n\n49.9429749 | 24.9835619\n\nPhoto: Yura Rommanyuk\n\nWelcome to the \"Golden Horseshoe\" of Lviv Oblast! A combination of a Renaissance palace with bastion fortifications, a breathtaking landscape and amazing architecture. As with any ancient building, the castle has a telling legend about the alchemist Severyn Zhevusky. It is said that he hid countless treasures in dungeons. Will you try to find it?\n\nOlesky castle, Olesko, Lviv region\n\n49.9683756 | 24.9008778\n\nPhoto: Vasyl Pavlenko\n\nThere is nothing to go from the previous place to it. The castle was built at the beginning of the 14th century, and was located on the then borders of Poland and Lithuania. Despite numerous conquests and battles, it was preserved in excellent condition. Be sure to go inside - you will definitely be impressed by the luxurious interior and priceless exhibits of the museum."
