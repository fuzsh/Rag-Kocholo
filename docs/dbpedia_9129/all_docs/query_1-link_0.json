        "text": "1795–1925 unit of Russia\n\nGovernorate in Southwestern, Russian Empire\n\nVolhynia Governorate, also known as Volyn Governorate,[a] was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) of the Southwestern Krai of the Russian Empire. It consisted of an area of 71,736 square kilometres (27,697 sq mi) and a population of 2,989,482 inhabitants. The governorate bordered Grodno and Minsk Governorates to the north, Kiev Governorate to the east, Podolia Governorate to the south, Lublin and Siedlce Governorates, and after 1912, Kholm Governorate and Austria to the west. Its capital was in Novograd-Volynsky until 1804, and then Zhitomir. It corresponded to most of modern-day Volyn, Rivne and Zhytomyr Oblasts of Ukraine and some parts of Brest and Gomel Regions of Belarus.\n\nIt was created at the end of 1796 after the Third Partition of Poland from the territory of the short-lived Volhynian Vice-royalty and Wołyń Voivodeship. After the Peace of Riga, part of the governorate became the new Wołyń Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic,[1] while the other part stayed as a part of the Ukrainian SSR until 1925 when it was abolished on resolution of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee and Counsel of People's Commissars.[2]\n\nUntil 1796, the guberniya was administered as a Viceroyalty (namestnichestvo). It was initially centred in Izyaslav and was called the Izyaslav Viceroyalty. It was primarily created from the Kiev Voivodeship and the eastern part of the Wolyn Voivodeship.\n\nOn 24 October 1795, the Third Partition of Poland was imposed by Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy, and the Russian Empire.\n\nThen, on 12 December 1796, Volhynia Governorate was established, encompassing the remaining territory of the Wolyn Voivodeship and the Kowel Voivodeship.\n\nIn 1796, the administration moved to Novograd-Volynsky. However, due to the lack of suitable buildings for administrative purposes, the capital was moved once again to Zhitomir (Zhytomyr).\n\nIn 1802, Zhitomir was purchased the properties of Prince Ilyinsky, and in 1804, it officially became the seat of Volhynia Governorate.\n\nFrom 1832 to 1915, Volhynia Governorate, along with Kiev Governorate and Podolia Governorate, formed part of the Southwestern Krai General-Governorate–a militarized administrative-territorial unit.\n\nIn the 1880s, the general-governorate was extended to include other governorates.\n\nIn 1897, the population of the guberniya was 2,989,482 and by 1905, it had grown to 3,920,400. The majority of the population in the governorate spoke the Ukrainian language with slight variety of dialects.\n\nDuring the Ukrainian–Soviet War Zhitomir served as the provisional capital of Ukraine in 1918.\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet war in 1920, and according to the Peace of Riga (1921) most of the territory became part of the Second Polish Republic and transformed into the Wołyń Voivodeship, with the capital in Łuck (Lutsk). The eastern portion existed until 1925 and was later split into three okruhas: Shepetivka Okruha, Zhytomyr Okruha, and Korosten Okruha.\n\nRevkom\n\n1919 Mikhail Kruchinskiy (concurrently the head of Volyn Cheka)\n\nVolyn Executive Committee\n\n1920 Oleksandr Shumsky\n\n1920 Vasiliy Averin\n\n– 1921 Danylevych\n\n1921–1922 Ivan Nikolayenko\n\nCheka\n\n1919 Vasyl Viliavko\n\n1919 M.Shuf\n\n1919 Mikhail Kruchinskiy\n\nNovember 1919 – December 1919 Vsevolod Balytsky\n\nDecember 1919 Vasyl Levotsky (acting)\n\n– 2 November 1921 Semen Kesselman (Zapadny)\n\nJanuary 1922 – 2 June 1922 Janis Biksons\n\nGPU\n\n-1923 Pavel Ivonin\n\nMarch 1923 – October 1923 Foma Leoniuk\n\n1 July 1923 – 1 September 1924 Symon Dukelsky\n\n1924 – 1925 Aleksandr Safes (Grozny)\n\nRussian Census of 1897\n\nZhytomir – 65 895 (Jewish – 30 572, Russian – 16 944, Ukrainian – 9 152)\n\nRovno – 24 573 (Jewish – 13 704, Russian – 4 278, Ukrainian – 4 071)\n\nKremenets – 17 704 (Ukrainian – 8 322, Jewish – 6 476, Russian – 1 863)\n\nKovel – 17 697 (Jewish – 8 502, Russian – 4 828, Ukrainian – 2 093)\n\nNovograd-Volynsky – 16 904 (Jewish – 9 363, Russian – 2 939, Ukrainian – 2 662)\n\nStarokonstantinov – 16 377 (Jewish – 9 164, Ukrainian – 4 886, Russian – 1 402)\n\nLutsk – 15 804 (Jewish – 9 396, Russian – 2 830, Ukrainian – 1 478)\n\nOstrog – 14 749 (Jewish – 9 185, Ukrainian – 2 446, Russian – 2 199)\n\nDubno – 14 257 (Jewish – 7 096, Russian – 2 962, Ukrainian – 2 474)\n\nZaslavl – 12 611 (Jewish – 5 991, Ukrainian – 3 990, Russian – 1 722)\n\nCounty Capital Arms of capital Area Population\n\n(1897 census) Transliteration name Russian Cyrillic Vladimir-Volynsky Владиміро-Волынскій Vladimir-Volynsky 6,482.1 km2\n\n(2,502.8 sq mi) 198,688 Dubensky Дубенскій Dubno 3,963.8 km2\n\n(1,530.4 sq mi) 158,734 Zhitomirsky Житомірскій Zhitomir 7,670.5 km2\n\n(2,961.6 sq mi) 281,387 Zaslavsky Заславскій Zaslavl 3,476.7 km2\n\n(1,342.4 sq mi) 93,381 Kovelsky Ковельскій Kovel 7,656.8 km2\n\n(2,956.3 sq mi) 121,326 Kremenetsky Кременецкій Kremenets 3,460.8 km2\n\n(1,336.2 sq mi) 196,751 Lutsky Луцкій Lutsk 7,540.8 km2\n\n(2,911.5 sq mi) 203,761 Novograd-Volynsky Новоградъ-Волынскій Novograd-Volynsky 7,205 km2\n\n(2,782 sq mi) 273,123 Ovruchsky Овручскій Ovruch 10,616.9 km2\n\n(4,099.2 sq mi) 194,796 Ostrozhsky Острожскій Ostrog 3,065.9 km2\n\n(1,183.8 sq mi) 166,882 Rovensky Ровенскій Rovno 8,568.4 km2\n\n(3,308.3 sq mi) 275,119 Starokonstantinovsky Староконстантиновскій Starokostiantinov 2,560.4 km2\n\n(988.6 sq mi) 211,768\n\nAccording to the Russian Empire Census on 28 January [O.S. 1897] 15 January, the Volhynian Governorate had a population of 2,982,482, including 1,502,803 men and 1,486,679 women.
