He was undersecretary of state for foreign affairs in the first two cabinets of Iuliu Maniu (1928-30 and 1932-33) and minister of industry and trade in the short-lived third (1933). After Maniu's final quarrel with King Carol II, Gafencu went back to journalism and founded Timpul, which became the best Bucharest daily.

He won an international reputation as one of the leading novelists of South America. Pres. Juan Vicente Gómez offered him a seat in the Senate, but Gallegos was unwilling to serve the dictator. In 1931 he left Venezuela for a voluntary exile of four years, until the death of Gómez. In 1936 he began a political career, serving briefly as minister of education, but his attempts to ban foreign mission schools in Venezuela forced his ouster. He helped found the Democratic Action party in 1941 and was the party's unsuccessful nominee against Isaías Medina Angarita later in the year. Gallegos was again the leftist party's candidate for president in elections held in December 1947 and won; he was inaugurated in February 1948. His liberalism displeased the military and certain powerful elements in the United States, and his government was overthrown by a military coup in November 1948. He was exiled to Cuba the following month and subsequently traveled to Mexico, where he remained until the ouster of the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958.

Jan. 12, 2003, Buenos Aires), president of Argentina (1981-82). He rose steadily through the ranks of the Army and became Army chief in 1981. His two visits to Washington in that year were successful in achieving understanding between the U.S. and Argentina on foreign policy and economic planning. As Army commander, he was a member of the three-man junta under the presidency of Gen. Roberto Viola. Viola's ill health and the armed forces' dissatisfaction with his administration's policies led to his removal. Galtieri, with the support of newly promoted generals, was sworn in as president on Dec. 22, 1981. For the first time since 1978 the posts of president and Army commander were united. He made a number of statements on the need for a gradual return to civilian participation in government. This gained him some popular support, and that support grew enormously when, on April 2, 1982, he and his fellow junta members decided on the invasion of the Falkland Islands. It was a national ambition to make the islands a part of Argentina. To some extent, the invasion also diverted attention away from widespread anger over the military's handling of the economy and its refusal to provide information on thousands of desaparecidos, victims of the 1976-79 suppression of opposition. But the war with Britain ended with the surrender of Galtieri's forces on June 14, and he resigned as Army commander on June 17. He was soon replaced as president by Reynaldo Bignone. In his wake he left much recrimination and further instability within the ruling armed forces. He served four years of a life sentence but was freed in 1989 by a pardon from Pres. Carlos Menem; he was again arrested on July 11, 2002, on the basis that the amnesty was unconstitutional.\n\nGalup (y Valdivieso), Manuel (b. 1833?, Lima, Peru - d.

Dec. 31, 1882, Ville-d'Avray, Seine-et-Oise [now in Hauts-de-Seine], France), French politician. In 1868, in a political case known as the Affaire Baudin, he delivered an extremely forceful speech in which he indicted the imperial regime. Press reports of his speech made his political fortune, and almost overnight he became an acknowledged leader of the Republican Party. In 1869 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly. He opposed the steps that led to the outbreak of the Franco-German War in July 1870, but, once it had begun, he urged the quickest possible victory over the Germans. He played a principal role in proclaiming the republic and forming a provisional government of national defense, in which he became interior minister. He began to arouse unoccupied France for the defense of the entire country. He became war minister as well, assuming virtually unlimited powers. Though he wished to continue fighting, the country was tired of war, and the provisional government signed an armistice on Jan. 18, 1871. The armistice convention provided for the election of a National Assembly, which met at Bordeaux in March 1871 to ratify the peace terms. He was elected a deputy for Strasbourg, in Alsace, but, after the ratification of the peace, which yielded most of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany, he lost his seat and retired for a short time to Spain. In by-elections in July 1871, he was elected to the National Assembly by the Seine département. With supreme skill, he managed to push ratification of the republic through a weary assembly.

March 31, 1939, Tbilisi, Georgian S.S.R. - d. Dec. 31, 1993, Jikhashkari village?, Tsalenjikha district, Samegrelo region, western Georgia), president of Georgia (1991-92). A prominent dissident in Soviet times, he was arrested on April 7, 1977, and, on May 19, 1978, sentenced in Tbilisi to three years in a labour camp and two years' internal exile for \"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.\" After a public confession he was released from the labour camp in 1979. In November 1990 elections to the Georgian Supreme Council were won by nationalists and he became its chairman. In April 1991 independence was declared and he was given the new post of president. In May he won 87% of the vote in direct presidential elections. An armed rebellion began in September, and he was overthrown in January 1992. He escaped with members of his government first to Armenia (Jan. 6-15, 1992) and then to Chechnya, until he was able to move to Zugdidi, western Georgia, on Sept. 24, 1993. His supporters had started a rebellion in that region in August and made increasing territorial gains. With Russian aid, however, the Tbilisi government of Eduard Shevardnadze defeated Gamsakhurdia's forces, Zugdidi being taken on November 6. On December 31 he died under circumstances that are still unclear. The body was found with a single bullet wound to the head. The Russian agency Interfax reported his wife as saying that he had committed suicide to evade capture by pro-government forces. On Feb. 24, 1994, his body was reburied in the Chechen capital Grozny but on Jan. 26, 2004, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili rehabilitated him and promulgated a decree granting permission for Gamsakhurdia's body to be reburied in Tbilisi. He praised him as a \"great statesman and patriot.\"\n\nGamurari, Boris (b. Dec. 1, 1946, Vascauti, Moldavian S.S.R.), defense minister of Moldova (1999-2001).

Gandhi\n\nGandhi, Indira (Priyadarshini), née Nehru (b. Nov. 19, 1917, Allahabad [now Prayagraj], India - d. Oct. 31, 1984, New Delhi, India), prime minister (1966-77, 1980-84) and foreign minister (1967-69, 1984) of India; daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. She was married to politician Feroze Gandhi (1912-1960). In 1964 Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri named her minister of information and broadcasting in his government. On Shastri's death in 1966, she became leader of the Congress party and thus also prime minister. She was also minister of atomic energy (1967-77), finance (1969-70), home affairs (1970-73), information and broadcasting (1971-74), space (1972-77), electronics (1973-77), planning (1975-77) and defense (1975, 1980-82). After the March 1972 elections, her defeated Socialist opponent charged that she had violated the election laws. In June 1975 the High Court of Allahabad ruled against her, which meant that she would be deprived of her seat in parliament and would have to stay out of politics for six years. In response, she declared a state of emergency, imprisoned her opponents, and assumed emergency powers, passing many laws limiting personal freedoms. When long-postponed elections were held in 1977, she and her party were soundly defeated. Early in 1978 her supporters split from the Congress party and formed the Congress (I) - I for Indira - party. She was briefly imprisoned (October 1977 and December 1978) on charges of official corruption, but she won a new seat in parliament in November 1978 and Congress (I) began to gather strength. When new elections were held in January 1980, she was swept back into power in a landslide victory. All legal cases against her were withdrawn. When Sikh extremists in the Punjab used violence to assert their demands for an autonomous state, Gandhi ordered an army attack in June 1984 on the Golden Temple of Amritsar, the Sikhs' holiest shrine, which led to the deaths of more than 450 Sikhs. Five months later Gandhi was killed in her garden by a fusillade of bullets fired by two of her own Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the attack on the Golden Temple.\n\nGandhi, Maneka (b. Aug. 26, 1956, New Delhi, India), Indian politician; widow of Sanjay Gandhi. She was minister of state (independent charge) for environment and forests (1989-91), programme implementation (1990, 2001-02), social justice and empowerment (1998-99, 1999-2001), culture (2001), animal care (2001-02), and statistics (2001-02) and minister of women and child development (2014-19).\n\nMohandas Gandhi\n\nGandhi, Mohandas (Karamchand), byname Mahatma Gandhi (b. Oct. 2, 1869, Porbandar [now in Gujarat], India - d. Jan. 30, 1948, Delhi, India), Indian political leader. While as a lawyer in South Africa, he witnessed the daily humiliations of Indians there and took up the fight on their behalf. In 1894 he founded the Natal Indian Congress and flooded the government, the legislature, and the press with closely reasoned statements of Indian grievances. He left South Africa in July 1914. In 1919 he launched a campaign of nonviolent struggle in India. He refashioned the old Indian National Congress into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism. He was arrested on March 10, 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in February 1924. One of his most spectacular and successful campaigns was directed against a salt tax (1930); it resulted in the imprisonment of more than 60,000 persons. A new chapter in Indo-British relations opened with the victory of the Labour Party in 1945. Prolonged triangular negotiations between leaders of the Congress and the Muslim League and the British government culminated in the formation of the two new dominions of India and Pakistan in August 1947. In 1946-47, the outbreak of communal riots between Hindus and Muslims unhappily created a climate in which Gandhi's appeals to reason and justice had little chance. When persuasion failed, he went on a fast. In September 1947 his fasting stopped the rioting in Calcutta, and in January 1948, he shamed the city of Delhi into a communal truce. A few days later, while he was on his way to his evening prayer meeting in Delhi, he was shot down by Nathuram Godse, a young Hindu fanatic.\n\nGandhi, Rahul (b. June 19, 1970, Delhi, India), Indian politician; son of Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. He was leader of the Congress party in 2017-19.\n\nRajiv Gandhi\n\nGandhi, Rajiv (b. Aug. 20, 1944, Bombay [now Mumbai], India - d. May 21, 1991, Sriperumbudur, near Madras [now Chennai], Tamil Nadu, India), prime minister of India (1984-89); son of Indira Gandhi. At first, Rajiv largely stayed out of politics, while his brother Sanjay, a vigorous political figure, was viewed as the heir apparent to the political dynasty that was founded by his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. But after Sanjay suddenly died in an airplane crash on June 23, 1980, Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, anxious to groom a successor, persuaded a reluctant Rajiv to enter the political arena. On June 15, 1981, he was elected in a by-election to the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) from Amethi. In the same month he became a member of the national executive of the Youth Congress. During the following two years he became more deeply involved in and apparently more enamoured of politics. In February 1983 Indira appointed Rajiv party secretary. When his mother was killed on Oct. 31, 1984, he was sworn in as prime minister that same day. On November 12 he was unanimously named president of the Congress (I) Party. The December 1984 elections returned him to power in a landslide dwarfing any experienced by his mother or his grandfather. Gandhi's attempts to discourage separatist movements in Punjab and Kashmir backfired, however, and his government became embroiled in several financial scandals. In the November 1989 elections Congress (I) lost control of the Lok Sabha. Gandhi was campaigning in Tamil Nadu for upcoming elections in which he hoped to regain the prime ministership when he was killed by a bomb carried by a woman who may have been associated with Tamil separatists. The chief suspect and six associates killed themselves to avoid capture.\n\nGandhi, Sanjay (b. Dec. 14, 1946, New Delhi, India - d. June 23, 1980, New Delhi), Indian politician; son of Indira Gandhi; brother of Rajiv Gandhi. Heir apparent of India's leading political family, he began to play an increasing role behind the scenes when his mother used her power as prime minister to declare a state of emergency in 1975. He was widely thought to be a powerful but negative influence on his mother's policies. His campaigns for birth control and slum clearance aroused hostility, mainly because of the harsh methods he used to implement them. But his ruthless and willful approach was combined with undoubted political acumen, and he was responsible for many of the electoral gains of his mother's Congress (I) Party and his own Youth Congress early in 1980. There were serious doubts, however, about his respect for democratic institutions and the use he would make of the power he seemed certain to acquire. Gandhi died when the light aircraft in which he was flying crashed.\n\nSonia Gandhi\n\nGandhi, Sonia, née Maino (b. Dec. 9, 1946, Lusiana, Vicenza province, Italy), Indian politician. She met Rajiv Gandhi in 1965 and they married in 1968. She became an Indian citizen in 1983. Though she campaigned for him during his years in politics, Sonia chose to remain in the background. When Rajiv was assassinated in 1991, Sonia was seen by many as the natural heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, and she was offered the leadership of the Congress (I) party. The party's elders had concluded that the right to assume responsibility for the party - and by implication India - was hers. She rejected the offer and remained at home in New Delhi, seldom appearing in public and refusing to discuss politics publicly. She did not visit Rajiv's former constituency in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, until 1993 - but the crowds cheered her. Subsequently, she traveled throughout the country on behalf of trusts and committees devoted to Indian public life. In May 1995 she finally broke her long silence and telephoned Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to urge him to allow two leading dissidents back into the party in time for the 1996 elections. In August she and her daughter, Priyanka, went to rural Amethi to dedicate a medical camp. There Sonia delivered an eight-minute address in which she praised Rajiv's dedication to the welfare of the people and expressed her anguish over the lack of progress into the investigation of his assassination. Resounding applause and shouts of anti-government slogans greeted this apparent criticism of Rao's leadership. In 1998 she agreed to enter politics and became president of the Congress party. She was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1999. After her party won elections in 2004, she refused to take the post of prime minister, but did take over the ruling coalition. In 2006 she resigned as MP and as head of the National Advisory Council, a body set up to oversee the government's development program, after accusations that the two functions are incompatible under a 1959 law. In 2017 she passed the party leadership to her son Rahul, but took over again in 2019-22.\n\nGane, Nicolae (b. Feb. 1, 1838, Falticeni, Moldavia [now in Romania] - d.

March 11, 2007, Palangkaraya, Kalimantan Tengah), governor of Kalimantan Tengah (1978-83).\n\nGaraikoetxea Urriza, Carlos (b. June 2, 1938, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain), Spanish politician. As leader of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), the leading Basque Christian Democrat party, he was one of the principal negotiators of the Basque autonomy statute signed with the central Spanish government in July 1979. The agreement provided for measures of home rule on such matters as education, justice, taxation, and finance and was greeted with widespread relief by Spain's politicians. The PNV acknowledged that the new agreement was better than the 1936 Basque autonomy statute but had to accept that the Basque provinces would remain under Spanish sovereignty - an essential precondition for its approval by the Army and right-wing legislators in Madrid. The PNV also endorsed plans for a special referendum to decide the status of Navarre, where loyalists to the Basques, the province, and Spain as a whole were deeply divided. Garaikoetxea's election as head of the Basque government was a virtual certainty following massive Basque acceptance of the autonomy statute in an October 25 referendum. Garaikoetxea announced his intention of negotiating with the militant Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) and its political ally, Herri Batasuna. Both of these advocated violence until the Basques attained complete independence. To be successful he would have to show that the central government in Madrid had transferred real power to the Consejo General Vasco; local control of the police force and courts were powerful symbols in his struggle to convince his opponents that their way forward lay in negotiations leading to a peaceful transfer of power. He was replaced as head of government in 1985 after a long-standing dispute with the PNV directorate over policy.\n\nGarami, Ernö (b. Dec. 13, 1876, Budapest, Hungary - d. May 28, 1935, Budapest), justice minister of Hungary (1919). He was also trade minister (1918-19).\n\nGarang\n\nGarang (de Mabior), John (b. June 23, 1945, Wagkulei village, near Bor, Upper Nile region, Sudan [now in Jonglei state, South Sudan] - d. July 30, 2005, near New Cush, Eastern Equatoria state, Sudan [now in Namorunyang state, South Sudan]), Sudanese rebel leader and politician. He joined the Anya Nya rebellion, which had been started by the non-Muslim southerners at the time of Sudanese independence in 1956. They sought the secession of the non-Islamic southern provinces from the Islamic north. After the fighting ended in 1972, Garang joined the national Army and was later promoted to chief of the Military Research Center with the rank of lieutenant colonel. The imposition of Shari`ah (Islamic law) in The Sudan by Pres. Gaafar Nimeiry in September 1983 proved the focus of major discontent in the south of the country. Shortly afterward Garang formed the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in opposition to Nimeiry's rule and to the introduction of Shari`ah in particular. The SPLM manifesto declared its opposition to all forms of military rule and its support of democratic parliamentary government. The movement did not call for secession of the south but favoured a unified country with a non-military government and sought the support of both Muslims and Christians in the war against Nimeiry. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the military wing of the SPLM, was welcomed by two of Nimeiry's most hostile neighbours, Libya and Ethiopia, which gave it arms and allowed SPLA bases on their territories. When Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985, however, Garang refused to end his fight and join the interim government because of its military involvement. For the same reason, he refused to allow the SPLM to participate in the 1986 elections for a new civilian government. He insisted on the abolition of Shari`ah as a prerequisite for a ceasefire. His forces gathered strength throughout the south. In 2005 he signed a peace agreement by which he became first vice president (the first southern Sudanese to hold this position since independence) and also president of a newly-created Government of Southern Sudan. Only three weeks after assuming those positions he was killed in a helicopter crash.\n\nGarango, Tiémoko Marc (b. July 27, 1927, Gaoua, Upper Volta [now Burkina Faso] - d.

He was president of the Senate (1876), governor of Antioquia (1892-93), and minister to Venezuela (1896-97).\n\nAlan García\n\nGarcía (Pérez), Alan (Gabriel Ludwig) (b. May 23, 1949, Lima, Peru - d. April 17, 2019, Lima), president of Peru (1985-90, 2006-11). He won his first political victory in 1980 when he gained a seat in the lower house of Congress. Two years later he became general secretary of the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA). In the 1985 presidential election, his opponents criticized his lack of political experience, and certainly he had no experience of governing. To his supporters, however, this very weakness became a strength, and certainly he did not bow to the customary pressures of the military and (more recently) the international bankers. He won a conclusive victory in the April 14 election. He narrowly missed winning outright with 48% of the vote, but the runner-up, Alfonso Barrantes Lingán of the Marxist Izquierda Unida party, conceded defeat, thus saving a second round of voting. García, who was sworn in on July 28, became the first elected president to succeed another democratically chosen candidate in Peru in more than 40 years. He was also the first APRA leader to take office as president, despite APRA's being the country's oldest political party. After taking office García became extremely visible both at home and abroad. García turned Peru into an international financial pariah with galloping hyperinflation of 7,650%, challenged the International Monetary Fund, and announced he would limit Peru's debt payments to 10% of exports. He scored 80% popularity ratings before slumping to rank as one of the country's least-loved leaders by the time he left office with the economy in a shambles and Shining Path guerrillas on the rampage. After spending much of his time since 1992 in Bogotá, Colombia, he returned to Peru in January 2001 to launch a reelection bid which he lost to Alejandro Toledo. He won, however, in 2006, defeating Ollanta Humala in a runoff. Running again in 2016, he only came fifth. He shot himself in 2019 when police came to arrest him in connection with corruption allegations.\n\nGarcia, Carlos P(olestico) (b. Nov. 4, 1896, Talibon, Philippines - d. June 14, 1971, Quezon City, Philippines), president of the Philippines (1957-61). He was a representative in the Philippine Congress, governor of his province (Bohol), and then (1941-53) senator. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Garcia was active in the resistance movement. He was elected vice president on the ticket of the Nacionalista Party in 1953 and was also minister of foreign affairs (1953-57). As foreign minister he presided over the Manila conference of 1954, which produced the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and later led the Filipino delegation to three succeeding SEATO meetings in Bangkok, Karachi, and Canberra. He became president of the Philippines in March 1957, upon the death of Pres. Ramon Magsaysay, and was elected to a full four-year term the same year. He maintained the strong traditional ties with the United States and sought closer relations with non-Communist Asian countries. His greatest claim to fame was his championing of the nationalistic \"Filipino first\" policy, which sought to transfer control of the country's economy from foreign to Filipino hands. In the election of November 1961 he was defeated by Vice Pres. Diosdado Macapagal. In 1971 he was elected president of the constitutional convention, but died three days later.\n\nGarcía (Estrada), Francisco E(spartaco) (b. July 4, 1920, Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico - d.
