KYIV, THE CAPITAL OF UKRAINE, AND THE KYIV REGION\n\nWith the founding of Kyivan Rus' in the second half of the 9th century, Kyiv became its capital and the heart of this first state to arise among the Eastern Slavs. From the 9th to the 14th centuries today's Kyiv region constituted parts of two major principalities of Kyivan Rus': Kyiv principality and Pereiaslav principality. At that time, Kyiv was the religious center of Eastern Europe. A metropolitan's see, it had numerous churches and monasteries (the most famous being the Kyivan Cave Monastery). It was also a center of learning, writing, book transcribing, and painting. The first Rus' chronicles were written there. The Saint Sophia Cathedral housed the prince's library--the first library in Ukraine. However, the richness and fame of Kyiv attracted many plunderers, and the city sustained numerous attacks and ruin as a result of foreign invasions and the internecine struggle between Rus' princes. In 1240, Kyiv was sacked by the Mongol-Tatar army of Batu Khan, which decimated its population. In 1362-3 Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania annexed the Kyiv land to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an appanage principality. In 1497 the entire city received the rights of Magdeburg law. In 1569, in keeping with the provisions of the Union of Lublin, Kyiv and Kyiv voivodeship came under Polish rule and cultural influence as part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During Cossack period, in the early 17th century, Kyiv underwent a renaissance, becoming the political, religious, and cultural center of Ukraine. The Cossack hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny (ca 1610-22) resided there and belonged to the Kyiv Epiphany Brotherhood. In 1620 Patriarch Theophanes III of Jerusalem restored the Ukrainian Orthodox church hierarchy and Kyiv metropoly. The school founded by Metropolitan Petro Mohyla at the Kyivan Cave Monastery was amalgamated with the brotherhood school in 1633 to form the famous Kyivan Mohyla College (renamed the Kyivan Mohyla Academy in 1701). During the Cossack-Polish War, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and his army triumphantly entered Kyiv in December 1648. His army cleared the city of Polish forces, and Kyiv became the capital of Kyiv regiment. However, after the Pereiaslav Treaty of 1654, a Muscovite fortress was built in the upper city. In the 1830s and 1840s, after the suppression of the Polish Insurrection of 1830-1, intensive government-directed Russification of the city occurred. In 1835 Kyiv's rights of Magdeburg law was officially rescinded. Despite Russification and repression, a Ukrainian national movement arose in Kyiv. The secret Society of United Slavs (1823-5) and the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood (1845-7) were based there. The Ukrainophile student society, which later became the famous Hromada of Kyiv in 1859, had among its members many figures who came to play leading roles in the development of modern Ukrainian life...

THE LANDSCAPES AND PEOPLE OF THE UKRAINIAN CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS\n\nThe Ukrainian Carpathians are mountains of medium height with rock of low resistance. Gentle and broad ridges and parallel valleys contrast with the deeply incised (up to 1,000 m) transverse valleys with steep slopes. Only the highest parts of the Carpathians--mainly the Hutsul Alps and Chornohora--display a high-mountain landscape. The Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains are known for its beautiful landscapes and unique flora and fauna. Because of the abundance of mineral springs, a healthy climate, and natural beauty, they are the main resort and recreation area in Ukraine after the Crimea. At the same time, they represent an ethnographic region rich in history and cultural heritage and include such subregions as the Hutsul region, Boiko region, Lemko region, as well as parts of Bukovyna and Transcarpathia. Learn more about this natural jewel of Ukraine by visiting the following entries:\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries dedicated to the Carpathian Mountains region were made possible by a generous donation from TEOFIL SUDOMLAK of Renown Park, S.A., Australia.\n\nIII. NATURAL TREASURES OF THE UKRAINIAN CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS\n\nThe Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains constitute one of the most important and unique ecoregions in Europe. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) recognized the Carpathians as a natural treasure of global importance and included it in its \"Global 200\" list of the most significant ecosystems on our planet. The rich and unique flora and fauna of the region is being preserved within a network of national parks and nature preserves established with the specific aim of protecting the biological and landscape diversity of the Ukrainian Carpathians. Because two-thirds of Ukraine?s territory lies within the steppe and forest-steppe zones, characterized by lowland landscapes and steppe flora and fauna, the Carpathian Mountains have a particular significance for Ukraine and are considered part of the national heritage. While protected areas occupy about 4 percent of Ukraine?s entire territory, in the Ukrainian Carpathians they occupy 8 percent, and in Transcarpathia oblast over 13 percent.

THE CHERKASY REGION: THE HEARTLAND OF UKRAINE\n\nLocated at the very centre of Ukraine, the Cherkasy region has a particularly ancient and rich history. Archeological excavations have shown that more than 40 thousand years ago primitive inhabitants of the region used flint and bones of gigantic animals (mammoths, fleecy rhinoceroses, and bisons) as tools for land-tilling and bunting. More than six thousand years ago, very large Trypilian culture settlements (the largest of them was home to 15-20 thousand inhabitants) were established in the western part of the region. Scythians, Sarmatians, and later Antes and Polianians inhabited these fertile lands along the Dnipro River during the subsequent centuries. During the times of Kievan Rus', the region played the role of an important military forepost against the steppe nomads and it controlled a vital part of the Varangian trade route to Constantinople. The Cherkasy region gained paricular importance during the Cossack era. In the 16th cetury such Cherkasy starostas as Ostafii Dashkevych and Prince Dmytro Vyshnevetsky established the Cossack military force in the region to fend off Tatar incursions. During the Cossack Polish War of 1648-1657 the Cherkasy region was one of the most vital Cossack strongholds and Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky's capital of the Cossack Hetman state was located there in the town of Chyhyryn. The region is also famous as a birthplace of Ukraine's national poet Taras Shevchenko, who was buried at the city of Kaniv...

THE ANCIENT CITY OF CHERNIHIV AND THE CHERNIHIV REGION\n\nThe Chernihiv region in northeastern Ukraine has been inhabited since the middle Paleolithic Period (ca 40,000 BC). Some of the earliest examples in Ukraine of art (ornamented jewellry) and architecture (dwellings constructed out of mammoth bones), dating back to 18,000 BC, have been discovered in the region (the Mizyn archeological site). Relicts from the Tripillian culture of the Neolithic Period (ca 4,000 BC) as well as later remains of Scythian fortified settlements (5th century BC) have also been discovered. In the 7th-8th century the tribe of Siverianians settled on the Desna, Seim, and Sula rivers and made Chernihiv their center. In the 9th century the region became a part of Kyivan Rus', and Chernihiv became an important political, cultural, and economic center in the new state, the capital of Chernihiv principality. Devastated by the Mongol invasion in the mid 13th century, the city of Chernihiv and the region recovered in the mid-14th century, after Algirdas, the grand duke of Lithuania, defeated the Tatars and gained control of the region. At first Lithuania respected the autonomy of the appanage principalities, leaving them in the hands of local princes. At the beginning of the 15th century, however, the small principalities were abolished, and administrators were appointed. In the war of 1500-3 Lithuania lost the region to Muscovy. Poland obtained the territory by the Truce of Deulino in 1618. The Polish administration exploited the local population, and the Polish nobility seized lands belonging to Ukrainian peasants or burghers. Hence the population of the region took part in the Cossack uprisings of Pavlo Pavliuk (1637) and Yakiv Ostrianyn (1638) against the Poles. At the end of 1648, during Bohdan Khmelnytsky's uprising (the Cossack-Polish War), the Chernihiv, Starodub, Nizhyn, and Pryluky regiments were formed and incorporated into the Hetman state. The Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation under Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky (Treaty of Hadiach) led to the Ukrainian-Muscovite war, in which the tsar's army was crushed at Konotop on 8 July 1659. The Treaty of Andrusovo, signed on 30 January 1667, divided Ukraine between Poland and Russia. The Chernihiv region, along with the rest of Left-Bank Ukraine, was annexed by Russia. The capitals of the Russian-ruled Hetman state were Baturyn (1669-1708 and 1750-64) and Hlukhiv (1708-50). In the 17th-18th century the region played a leading cultural role in Left-Bank Ukraine, and indeed the whole of Ukraine. Such cultural and religious leaders as Lazar Baranovych, Ioanikii Galiatovsky, and Ioan Maksymovych lived and worked there. In 1700 Ioan Maksymovych founded Chernihiv College on the model of the Kyivan Mohyla Academy. Printing was an important factor in the growth of culture and education: in 1675 a printing press was established in Novhorod-Siverskyi and was later transferred to Chernihiv. During the Hetman period and at the end of the 18th century architecture in the Chernihiv region attained a high degree of development. Monuments of the Princely era were restored, and new architectural ensembles in the style of the Cossack baroque were erected...

THE CITY OF CHERNIVTSI AND THE NORTHERN BUKOVYNA REGION\n\nLocated in southwestern Ukraine, between the middle Dniester River and the main range of the Carpathian Mountains, Bukovyna is a transitional land between Ukraine and Romania. The name of this territory is derived from its great beech (buk) forests and dates back to the late 14th century when it designated the lands on the Moldavian-Polish border. From a historical perspective it is a strategically important border area between Galicia and Moldavia. Bukovyna's transitional location influenced its history; it belonged to the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia, then to Moldavia. Polish and Hungarian influences intersected here in the 14th and 15th centuries. Between 1774 and 1918 Bukovyna was under Habsburg rule within the Austrian Empire. In 1919-40 and 1941-4 all of Bukovyna belonged to Romania. It was only in 1940 that Bukovyna was divided, roughly along ethnic lines, between Ukraine and Romania. Today Chernivtsi oblast or most of northern Bukovyna is located in Ukraine, while most of the Suceava region or southern Bukovyna belongs to Romania. The present political border does not exactly coincide with the ethnic border: Romania contains the southern part of the Ukrainian ethnic peninsula with Seret and a string of mountain villages, while Ukraine contains the Romanian ethnic wedge that extends to Chernivtsi. Chernivtsi is Bukovyna's capital and the region's largest city...

THE CRIMEA (1): THE SOUTHERNMOST REGION OF UKRAINE\n\nThe Crimean Peninsula, which forms the southernmost tip of Ukraine (and is currently illegally occupied by the Russian Federation), was, throughout its history, often dominated politically and culturally by southern states and, at the same time, influenced by governments that controlled the Ukrainian mainland. The peninsula itself was too small to organize a strong, independent state. The earliest historical population in the Crimea was the Cimmerians, of Iranian descent, who arrived there around 10,000 BC. They were forced out by the Scythians in the 7th century BC. In the 6th century BC the Greeks began to establish colonies on the Crimean coast. The most successful colonies were Chersonese Taurica (now Sevastopol), Panticapaeum (now Kerch), and Teodosiia. From the 5th century BC until the 4th century AD the Bosporan Kingdom, with Panticapaeum as capital, controlled the eastern Crimea. At the end of the 5th century AD the Crimean coast came under the rule of Byzantium. For a time the Crimea mediated between Kyivan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. Prince Volodymyr the Great of Kyiv captured Chersonese Taurica in 988 and in the 10th-12th century the eastern part of the Crimea belonged to Tmutorokan principality, which was part of the Kyivan Rus' state. When the Crusaders took Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire lost its influence in the Crimea. In the mid-13th century Venetian and, more importantly, Genoese trade colonies were established there. From the mid-13th century the Crimea, except for the Italian colonies, was seized by the Tatars of the Golden Horde who eventually organized a separate state known as the Crimean Khanate. In 1474 Turkey captured the Italian colonies in the southern Crimea, and in 1478 the Crimean Khanate recognized the supremacy of the Ottoman Empire. Tatar forces invaded the Ukrainian lands almost annually, destroying the towns and villages and seizing inhabitants, whom they later sold at slave markets. In the 16th century the Ukrainian Cossacks came to the defense of the population, and by the beginning of the 17th century they took the offensive against the Tatars. In the 18th century the Cossacks helped the Russian Empire wrest control of the Black Sea coast from Turkey and the Crimean Khanate. The Russo-Turkish peace treaty of 1774 led to Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 1783. In 1775 the population of the Crimea consisted primarily of Crimean Tatars (200,000 or 80 percent of the population). However, following the Russian annexation, the number of Tatars declined continuously in absolute and relative terms: in 1897 there were 194,000 or 35.5 percent; in 1926 there were 179,000 or 25.1 percent. After the Second World War, in 1944, the Soviet authorities forcefully deported the entire Crimean Tatar population from the Crimea to the Soviet interior...

THE CRIMEA (2): CRIMEAN MOUNTAINS AND CRIMEAN SOUTHERN SHORE\n\nThe exotically picturesque Crimean Mountains lie in the southernmost part of Ukraine, in the southern part of the Crimean Peninsula. Their highest range, the Yaila, forms a large, high plateau, which drops suddenly several hundred meters to the Black Sea coast. The original flora and fauna of the region are preserved best at the Crimean Game Preserve. In the west the Crimean Mountains descend directly into the Black Sea. East of Foros the mountains recede from the sea for a few kilometers and create a sheltered shore. This narrow (2?12 km) coastal lowland, known as the Crimean southern shore or the Crimean Riviera, has a subtropical Mediterranean climate and vegetation. Composed of the low-resistance schist, susceptible to abrasive activity, the mountains on the Black Sea shore form numerous cliffs and caves above and below water. Owing to its mild climate, the curative powers of the sea, salt lakes, and curative muds, and its natural beauty, the Crimean southern shore constitutes the principal resort and tourist area of Ukraine and one of the most important ones in Eastern Europe...

THE DNIPRO, THE DNISTER, AND OTHER RIVERS OF UKRAINE\n\nFrom the dawn of history the Dnipro River has been closely bound up with the life of the Ukrainian people. It is the ?holy river' of Ukraine. It was known as the Borysthenes to the ancient Greeks and Romans (Herodotus first used the name in the 5th century BC). All the important towns of Kyivan Rus' (except those of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia) were located on the Dnipro or in its vicinity. In the 16th?17th century the Zaporozhian Sich arose on the lower Dnipro and became the nucleus of the second Ukrainian state. The river became the Cossack route to the Black Sea. During the hetmancy of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, it became the principal river of the Cossack state. Today the Dnipro is the main river network of Ukraine. Half of Ukraine's waterways belong to this system. Ukraine's second-largest river, the Dniester, is the main river in Galicia. For this reason Galicia is sometimes called Naddnistrianshchyna (Land by the Dniester). Other large rivers of Ukraine?the Donets in the east, the Boh in the southwest, and the Desna in the north?have had and continue to have a profound influence on the history of Ukraine and the life of its people. Learn more about the rivers of Ukraine by visiting the following entries:\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries dedicated to the Dnipro and other rivers of Ukraine were made possible by the financial support of the FOUNDATION OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF UKRAINE (Toronto, ON, Canada).\n\nX. THE DNIPRO INDUSTRIAL REGION\n\nAfter the Donets Basin (Donbas), the Dnipro Industrial Region is the second-largest concentration of heavy industry in Ukraine. It is located in the central part of the steppe (in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia oblasts, and parts of Kirovohrad and Poltava oblasts), at the bend of the Dnipro River, and covers 16,900 sq km and has a population of about 3,250,000. The industry of the region is grouped into several heavily populated centers, which contain 90 percent of the region's population. The largest and most important center is the Dnipro Industrial Region proper, which consists of the city of Dnipro (2018 pop 1,000,506) and its neighboring cities--Kamianske, Novomoskovsk, and Verkhnodniprovsk. Another center, the city of Zaporizhia (2016 pop 754,619) and its suburbs, and the smallest center, Nikopol (2018 pop 112,102), lie on the Dnipro River. The industrial development of the Dnipro region is the result of the mining of large deposits in the Kryvyi Rih Iron-ore Basin and the Nikopol Manganese Basin (and, partially, the Dnipro Lignite Coal Basin), the proximity of the Donets Basin and its huge deposits of coal, the region's convenient geographical location at the intersection of north-south and east-west transportation routes, and the availability of industrial water, river transportation, and hydroelectric power from the Dnipro River (the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station of the Dnipro Cascade of Hydroelectric Stations). Among the natural resources of the region are building materials, refractory clays, and clayey soil. At the end of the 19th century (1897) the population of the Dnipro Industrial Region was about 700,000 (estimate), 27 percent of which (186,000) lived in towns. The population was 950,000 in 1914 (estimate), 1,100,000 in 1926, and 3,250,000 in 1978. Thus, in 52 years the population tripled. Prior to industrialization, almost 90 percent of the region's population consisted of Ukrainians, if one excludes the cities, particularly Katerynoslav, which had a mixed population of Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, and some Germans. Industrialization stimulated the in-migration of Russians: insignificant at first, it increased in the 1930s and continued to increase until the 1990s. After 1950 the population of the region increased more rapidly than that of the Donbas, and the populations of Dnipropetrovsk (now Dnipro), Dniprodzerzhynsk (now Kamianske), and Zaporizhia grew more rapidly than that of any other Ukrainian city except Kyiv...

THE FAUNA OF UKRAINE AND WILDLIFE PRESERVATION\n\nZoogeographically, the fauna of Ukraine belongs to the Euro-Siberian zone. Only the Crimean Mountains belong to the Mediterranean subzone. Because of Ukraine's border locations and the absence of natural barriers, its fauna is intermediate between the fauna of Europe and Central Asia, and between the fauna of the forest belt and the steppe belt and that of the subtropics. The western boundaries of the habitats of many eastern animal species run through Ukraine; similarly, the eastern and northern limits of the habitats of many western European and Mediterranean species are found in Ukraine. The Dnipro River is an important natural barrier to the east-west distribution of animals. In general, there are about 28,000 animal species on the territory of Ukraine, among them more than 690 species of vertebrates (101 mammal, 350 bird, 21 reptile, 19 amphibian, and over 200 fish, 110 of which are freshwater species). The widespread and increasingly intensive use of land for agriculture, the growth of large-scale exploitation of forests and minerals, and rapid industrialization and urbanization resulted in the need to protect what remains of the rich flora and fauna of Ukraine from extinction through a network of nature preserves that provide full protection to wildlife as well as wildlife refuges that provide partial protection...

THE FLORA OF UKRAINE: FORESTS, FOREST-STEPPE, AND STEPPES\n\nUkraine, like any other world region, is shaped by and fully dependent on its vegetation. The plants support critical functions in the biosphere, at all possible levels. They regulate the flow of numerous biogeochemical cycles; they influence the climate and affect soil characteristics; they serve as wildlife habitat and the energy source for animals and humans; they are also critically important to the national and world economy. In Ukraine, the close relation between vegetation and climate, relief, humidity, and soil is apparent in the organization of plant life into wide meridional belts stretching from the southwest to the northeast. Moving from north to south the belts are forest, forest-steppe, steppe, and the zone of Mediterranean vegetation. Human agricultural activity greatly altered the original vegetation of Ukraine. Almost all the steppe is under cultivation and devoted to agricultural species. Large areas of the forest belt have also been converted to agricultural use. Intense long-term logging in the Carpathian Mountains has diminished the protective influence of the forests, as frequent floods and increasing erosion have shown. Between 1814 and 1914 the forest area in Ukraine diminished by 30.5 percent. Only a few ancient tracts remain untouched by humans, and for their preservation they have been placed under state protection...

THE CITY OF LVIV AND THE HISTORIC REGION OF GALICIA\n\nAfter the death of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise in 1054, Kyivan Rus' began to fall apart into its component principalities. From 1084 Yaroslav's great-grandsons, Riuryk, Volodar, and Vasylko Rostyslavych, ruled the lands of Peremyshl, Zvenyhorod, and Terebovlia in the western regions of the Rus' state. Volodar's son, Volodymyrko made princely Halych his capital, and his son, Yaroslav Osmomysl, enlarged Halych principality during his reign (1153-87) to encompass all the lands between the Carpathian Mountains and the Dnister River as far south as the lower Danube River. This region assumed the historic name of Galicia. Prince Roman Mstyslavych united Galicia with Volhynia and thus created the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia, which fourished during the reign of Prince (and later King) Danylo Romanovych (1238-64). In 1272 Lviv became the capital, and in 1303 Halych metropoly was founded. But resurgent boyar defiance, the Mongol invasion, and the territorial ambitions of Poland and Hungary took their toll. In 1349 King Casimir III the Great of Poland invaded Galicia and progressively occupied it. The entire region remained under Polish rule until 1772 when it was annexed by the Ausrian Empire. All this time, however, Galicia was a very important centre of Ukrainian national, cultural, and religious life. The defence of Ukrainian interests in the face of strong Polish pressures was assumed by the Orthodox brotherhoods. One of the first was the Lviv Dormition Brotherhood, which existed as early as 1463, but which became most active after the 1580s. However, it was only under Austrian rule in the 18th and 19th centuries that Galicia found favorable conditions to the Ukrainians' religious life and education. Under the impact of Romanticism and developments in central and eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian cultural and national renaissance began in Galicia in the 1820s. This renaissance reached it apogee in the Revolution of 1848-9 in the Habsburg monarchy when the Supreme Ruthenian Council was founded to represent Galician Ukrainian national aspirations. In the period 1867-1914, Ukrainian cultural and, to some extent, political life in Galicia underwent a remarkable growth. After the Ems Ukase prohibited Ukrainian publications in Russian-ruled Ukraine in 1876, Galicia became the 'Piedmont' of the Ukrainian movement. When the First World War broke out, the Ukrainian parties founded the Supreme Ukrainian Council in August 1914 in Lviv. Before the collapse of the Habsburg state, Galician and Bukovynian political leaders met in Lviv and proclaimed a Ukrainian state on the territories of Galicia, northern Bukovyna, and Ukrainian Transcarpathia--the Western Ukrainian National Republic (ZUNR). On 3 January 1919 the ZUNR officially united with the Ukrainian National Republic, creating thus a unified independent Ukrainian state...

IVANO-FRANKIVSK AND THE CENTRAL SUBCARPATHIA AND POKUTIA REGIONS\n\nThe picturesque region of Subcarpathia, spreading to the east of the Carpathian Mountains, and the region of Pokutia, located still further to the east, belong to the most densely populated parts of Ukraine. The average population density in these regions approaches 220 persons (including 80 rural residents) per sq km. The central Subcarpathia with its main city of Ivano-Frankivsk (formerly Stanyslaviv) and Pokutia with its main city of Kolomyia, are also among the most ethnically homogeneous regions in Ukraine, with ethnic Ukrainians constituting over 90% of the population (over 97% in Pokutia), while Russians, Poles, and Jews represent the most numerous national minorities. During the Middle Ages these regions formed the centre of the Halych Principality in Kyivan Rus' and subsequently, of the Galician-Volhynian state. Controlled by Poland for several centuries and then ruled by the Austrian Empire until 1918, these regions constituted a vital part of the short-lived Western Ukrainian National Republic with Stanyslaviv (now Ivano-Frankivsk) serving as the republic's capital from December 1918 to May 1919. Today Ivano-Frankivsk oblast is one of the most vibrant cultural and economic region of western Ukraine...

THE CITY OF KHARKIV AND THE HISTORIC SLOBIDSKA UKRAINE\n\nThe territories in northeastern Ukraine centered today on the city of Kharkiv once belonged to the Kyiv and Chernihiv principalities of Kyivan Rus'. With the Mongol invasions of the 13th century they were largely unsettled and constituted part of the so-called Dyke Pole, a wild steppe dominated by nomadic tribes. In the 16th century Ukrainian Cossacks and Russian peasants began settling there, and they became part of Slobidska Ukraine, a region of self-governing settlements called slobody. The generally accepted date of Kharkiv's founding is 1654/5, when Ukrainian Cossacks built a fortified settlement on the plateau surrounded by the Kharkiv River and the Lopan River. A fortress was completed in 1659. Today Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city and a bustling industrial and cultural center. From 1920 to 1934 it was the capital of Soviet Ukraine...

VINNYTSIA, KHMELNYTSKYI, AND THE LAND OF MIDDLE AND EASTERN PODILIA\n\nThe history of Podilia--the land located between Galicia and Subcarpathia in the west and the Dnipro Upland of central Ukraine in the east--was strongly influenced by its proximity to the steppe. According to the Primary Chronicle Podilia was settled by several Ukrainian tribes, and during the reign of Prince Oleh and Prince Ihor it became part of the Kyivan Rus' state. As the power of Kyivan Rus' waned under pressure from the Mongols, it lost interest in eastern Podilia, and the region became a marchland of Galicia. Western Podilia (today's Ternopil oblast) along with Galicia remained under the Romanovych dynasty, and middle and eastern Podilia was administered directly by the Tatar Golden Horde. The political situation changed in the mid-14th century when the Lithuanians defeated the Tatars at Syni Vody (1363) and captured middle Podilia. From the mid-15th century Podilia was the favorite target of Tatar raids. When they diminished, the fertile region attracted Polish colonists from the northwest, who filled the political power vacuum. Later middle and eastern Podilia played an important role in the Cossack Hetman state set up by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and was the seat of two Cossack regiments: Bratslav regiment and Vinnytsia regiment. In 1699 Podilia was taken by Poland. In 1712, after an unsuccessful rebellion, the Cossack regiments were disbanded. With the Second Partition of Poland (1793) middle and eastern Podilia was transferred to Russia. Kamianets-Podilskyi became the administrative center of Podilia gubernia and Podilia eparchy. The Ukrainian national and cultural movement developed slowly in Podilia, mainly at the end of the 19th century. Its centers were Kamianets-Podilskyi and Vinnytsia...

THE TERNOPIL REGION AND WESTERN PODILIA\n\nWith the First Partition of Poland (1772) western Podilia, east to the Zbruch River, was annexed by Austria, and with the Second Partition (1793) eastern Podilia was transferred to Russia. After this division each part of Podilia developed differently. Eastern Podilia saw the intensification of serfdom under Russian rule. In western Podilia centered around Ternopil, as in all Galicia, the Polish population continued to dominate the administration of the land. Nevertheless western Podilia, along with the rest of Galicia and Bukovyna, became the base of the modern Ukrainian national and political movement. Ternopil was the only major city in Western Ukraine in which Ukrainians outnumbered the Poles and Ukrainian burghers had attained substantial wealth and influence. During the Ukrainian struggle for independence (1917-20) western Podilia was part of the Western Ukrainian National Republic, and from 21 November 1918 to 2 January 1919 Ternopil served as the republic's provisional capital. In the interwar period western Podilia was ruled by Poland, but after the Second World War ir became part of the Ukrainian SSR as Ternopil oblast. Main cities of the region include Berezhany, Buchach, Chortkiv, Terebovilia, and Kremenets (which historically belonged to Volhynia)...

THE QUINTESSENTIALLY UKRAINIAN POLTAVA REGION\n\nA historical-geographic territory in Left-Bank Ukraine, the Poltava region played a crucial role in the history of the Ukrainian nation in its modern formative period of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The former land of the Cossack Hetman state, from 1825 the Poltava region took the lead in Ukrainian civic affairs away from the Chernihiv region, which had been the culturally and politically dominant region in the 18th century. The economic security and estate privileges enjoyed by the local landowners and the presence of a number of Cossack officer families afforded them the independence to preserve Ukrainian traditions in ideology and everyday life and to preserve the Ukrainian character of the people who lived on their estates. Among other prominent cultural leaders, Ivan Kotliarevsky, the founder of modern Ukrainian literature, was born and worked in Poltava. In addition to Poltava itself the regional cultural and political centers included cities such as Hadiach, Lubny, Myrhorod, and Pryluky, as well as the estates of such nobles as Dmytro Troshchynsky, Vasyl Kapnist, the Galagans, the Tarnovskys, and others. The society of these families proved to be receptive to the ideas of Taras Shevchenko and the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood. It also helped to establish the Ukrainophile nature of the region's zemstvo administration, which until 1917 was perhaps the most nationally conscious and active body in community and cultural life in central and eastern Ukraine. The Poltava region was also vitally important to the new Ukrainian state during Ukraine's struggle for independence in 1917-20. Many of the state's governmental leaders (Symon Petliura, Andrii Livytsky, Borys Martos, Mykola Porsh) were born there and became active there...

SOUTHCENTRAL UKRAINE (1): THE CITY OF KROPYVNYTSKYI AND ITS REGION\n\nFrom the 9th to 14th centuries, the region in southcentral Ukraine around today's city of Kropyvnytskyi, especially the region's northern parts, belonged to Kyivan Rus'. Then the territory came under Lithuanian rule in 1362 and Polish rule in 1569. By and large it was wild, unpopulated steppe. From the late 16th to the mid-18th centuries it was part of the lands of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and Ukrainian peasants began settling there. At the beginning of the Cossack-Polish War, in 1648, the Battle of Zhovti Vody took place in this region in which the Cossack forces surrounded and defeated the Polish army. In 1739 Russia acquired nominal rule over the territory and in 1752 created a region called New Serbia for Balkan military settlers. In 1754 the Saint Elizabeth Fortress was built to serve as the administrative center of the territory and in 1775 the fortress became the center of the new town of Yelysavethrad (today's Kropyvnytskyi). During the revolutionary years of 1918-20 various armed conflicts took place on the territory, involving, at various times, Ukrainian National Republic and German troops, the Bolsheviks, Nykyfor Hryhoriiv's partisans, Nestor Makhno's partisans, and the Denikin army. Under Soviet rule, in 1939, the territory was incoprporated into a new administrative unit: Kirovohrad oblast...

SOUTHCENTRAL UKRAINE (2): THE CITY OF DNIPRO AND ITS REGION\n\nAs part of southcentral Ukraine, also known as Steppe Ukraine, the region of today's city of Dnipro (formerly Katerynoslav and later Dnipropetrovsk) was permanently and conclusively settled by Ukrainians only in the second half of the 18th century. From the end of the 18th century until 1917 that area, as part of the Russian Empire, was known as New Russia. The history of the Dnipro region and the ethnic composition of its population were influenced by its location adjacent to the Asiatic steppes (the steppes of Southern Ukraine are their western extension). Throughout its history the region was repeatedly invaded by hordes of nomads from Asia, who severed the main territory of Ukraine and its inhabitants from the Black Sea. The emergence of the Cossacks around the Zaporozhian Sich in the mid-16th century resulted in a protracted struggle for control of the steppes. The matter was resolved only in the late 18th century, after Turkey's defeats in the Russo-Turkish wars created the conditions for permanent Ukrainian settlement in the steppes and their unification with the rest of Ukraine. Southern Ukraine thus joined Ukraine, which by that time had been incorporated within the Russian Empire. Since the late 19th century the region around today's city of Dnipro has developwd into one of the most industrialized areas in Ukraine, containing large urban clusters. The largest of them are Dnipro-Kamianske and Kryvyi Rih. Industry in the region is based on the large local deposits of iron ore in the Kryvyi Rih Iron-ore Basin and manganese ore in Nikopol raion (Nikopol Manganese Basin, one of the largest deposits in the world--1.1 billion tonnes), and on deposits (five billion tonnes) of coal near Pavlohrad...

THE SOUTHEASTERN UKRAINE (1): DONETSK OBLAST\n\nIn antiquity, the territory of today's Donetsk oblast was part of the domain of the Cimmerians (8th century BC), the Scythians (7th-3rd centuries BC), the Sarmatians (3rd century BC-230 AD), and the Alans (200-550 AD). In the 8th century it was controlled by the Khazar Kaganate. After the princes of Kyivan Rus' (most notably, Sviatoslav I Ihorovych) suppressed the Khazar domination of this region, this territory was taken over by the invading Pechenegs (9th-11th centuries), then the Polovtsians or Cumans (11th-13th centuries), and the Mongol-Tatars of the Golden Horde (13th-15th centuries). In the mid-15th century the Crimean Khanate, having separated from the Golden Horde, initially claimed the southwestern half of this depopulated territory. The Kyiv principality, at that time part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, claimed the northwestern part of this region. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, on their Azov campaigns (1570, 1637) to the Don River, penetrated this contested, dangerous borderland. In the mid-17th century, they began to colonize this area, creating the Kalmiius Cossack Sloboda. The colonization of this territory accelerated after the region was captured by the Russian Empire in the 18th century. Apart from the Cossacks, the colonists included invited Serbs, Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Wallachians from the Austrian Empire, Russian gentry, German colonists, and the Greeks forcibly resettled from the Crimea. The discovery of coal (1723) and exploration of the Donets Coal Basin (Donbas) led to coal mining and the development of metallurgy. Rapid industrial growth of the region in the late 19th century increased the demand for labor and most of the migrant workers arrived from Russia rather than Ukraine. As a result of this migration, the region became the most Russified part of Ukraine. During Ukraine's struggle for independence (1917-20) the territory was claimed as part of the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR), but was contested among the UNR Army, the Red Army, the Ukrainian anarchists (such as Nestor Makhno), and the anti-Bolshevik Russian 'White' Army. In 1920 the region came under Soviet control. Established in 1932, Donetsk oblast was an administrative unit in the Ukrainian SSR and after 1991, has been an integral part of independent Ukraine. But following the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in the Donbas in 2014, one part of Donetsk oblast--the self-proclaimed and Russia-controlled 'Donetsk People's Republic'--has been separated from the Ukraine-controlled Donetsk oblast by an active front that has severed links in transport, water supply, and power infrastructure...

THE SOUTHEASTERN UKRAINE (2): LUHANSK OBLAST\n\nThe territory of today's Luhansk oblast has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Period. In antiquity, it was part of the domain of the Cimmerians (8th century BC), the Scythians (7th-3rd centuries BC), the Sarmatians (3rd century BC-230 AD), and the Alans (a Sarmatian tribe, 200-550 AD). The territory was part of the Khazar Kaganate in the 8th century. When the Kyivan Rus' princes (most notably, Sviatoslav I Ihorovych) ended the Khazar domination and tried to control the area, the territory was invaded by the nomad Pechenegs (9th-11th centuries), then the Polovtsians or Cumans (11th-13th centuries), and then the Mongol-Tatars of the Golden Horde (13th-15th centuries). From the late 16th century there were two contending streams of colonizers in this area: from the north came Muscovite service personnel for the construction of defense lines against invaders from the Crimean Khanate; from the west came Ukrainian agricultural settlers. In the 1630s and 1650s a large influx of Zaporozhian Cossacks resulted in establishing settlements there as part of their territory known as Slobidska Ukraine. In the 18th century colonization accelerated. Imperial Russia invited Serbs, Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Wallachians from the Austrian Empire to form a belt of settlements on the lands of the Zaporozhian Cossacks south of the Donets River called Sloviano-Serbia. In 1764 Sloviano-Serbia was combined with other military belts of settlement to form the New Russia gubernia. In-migration and rural population in the region continued to grow throughout the 19th century. In the last third of the 19th century the southern part of this region, being part of the Donets Basin, experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization, accompanied by a large influx of Russian workers and administrators. This development continued throughout the 20th century. Luhansk oblast has a slight majority of Ukrainians in its population and, after the Crimea, the second highest proportion of Russians among the regions of Ukraine...

SOUTHERN UKRAINE (1), WESTERN PART: THE ODESA REGION\n\nThe history of Southern Ukraine and the ethnic composition of its population were influenced by its location on the littoral of the Black Sea (into which flow all the major rivers of Ukraine) adjacent to the Asiatic steppes (the steppes of Southern Ukraine are their western extension). Throughout its history the region was repeatedly invaded by hordes of nomads from Asia, who severed the main territory of Ukraine and its inhabitants from the Black Sea. At the same time the Mediterranean seafaring powers tried to establish colonies and extend their influence on the northern littoral of the Black Sea, and the peoples inhabiting the main territory of Ukraine also tried to reach the Black Sea shore. In antiquity the Greeks established ancient states on the northern Black Sea coast, some of which were later incorporated into the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The influences of the highly developed Mediterranean cultures contributed to the growth of the Kyivan Rus' state. The latter state's link with the south became tenuous in the 10th to 12th centuries, when the Pechenegs and then the Cumans invaded Southern Ukraine, and was almost completely severed in the 13th century after the Mongol invasion. The collapse of Byzantium and the occupation of Southern Ukraine at the end of the 15th century by Turkey through its vassal, the Crimean Khanate, converted Southern Ukraine into a depopulated steppe controlled by the nomads. The emergence of the Cossacks around the Zaporozhian Sich in the mid-16th century resulted in a protracted struggle for control of the steppes. The matter was resolved only in the late 18th century, after Turkey's defeats in the Russo-Turkish wars created the conditions for permanent Ukrainian settlement in the steppes and their unification with the rest of Ukraine...

SOUTHERN UKRAINE (2), CENTRAL PART: THE KHERSON AND MYKOLAIV REGIONS\n\nAccording to archeological evidence the central regions of Southern Ukraine, today's Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts, have been inhabited since the Paleolithic Period, as early as the 15th millennium BC. In the 8th to 3rd centuries BC the area was settled by Scythians and Sarmatians. The first Greek settlement on the northern Black Sea coast was established on Berezan Island (near today's Ochakiv) in the 7th century BC. Later this sparsely populated territory belonged nominally to Kyivan Rus', the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Crimean Khanate. It was captured by Turkey in 1475. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74 the region was annexed by Russia. Turkey's defeat and Russian annexation of these lands created the conditions for permanent Ukrainian settlement in the steppes and their unification with the rest of Ukraine, which by that time had been incorporated within the Russian Empire. The territory of the present Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts was a part of New Russia gubernia (1774-95, 1796-1803), Kherson gubernia (1803-1920), Mykolaiv gubernia (1921), and Odesa gubernia (after 1922). Eventually, Mykolaiv oblast was created in 1937 and Kherson oblast in 1944...

SOUTHERN UKRAINE (3), EASTERN PART: THE ZAPORIZHIA REGION\n\nThe territory of the today's Zaporizhia region in southern Ukraine was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic period. The most remarkable prehistoric site in the region is Kamiana Mohyla that contains ancient petroglyphs, the oldest of which are dated to 22nd millennium BC. From the 7th century BC the territory was controlled by the Scythians. They were forced by the Sarmatians to retreat southward in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. After the Sarmatians the Huns, Avars, and Khazars dominated the steppes. Kyivan Rus' was unable to establish effective control of the region after it vanquished the Khazars in 965. Control fell to the Pechenegs and Cumans and then the Tatars and the Crimean Khanate. In the 16th century the Zaporozhian Cossacks established themselves in the region along the Dnipro Rapids and for centuries resisted Turkish and Polish attacks. By the end of the 18th century Russia, with the help of the Cossacks, defeated the Turks and Tatars. It then promptly crushed the Zaporozhian Sich. It annexed the territory and assigned it to New Russia gubernia (1797-1802) and then divided it between Katerynoslav gubernia and Tavriia gubernia. In the revolutionary period the territory was divided among many local otamans, including the most prominent of them, Nestor Makhno, and witnessed much violence before Soviet rule was entrenched there in the early 1920s. According to the 2001 census, Ukrainians accounted for 70.8 percent of the region's population, Russians for 24.74 percent, Bulgarians for 1.44 percent, and Belarusians for 0.66 percent. The largest cities are Zaporizhia, Melitopol, and Berdiansk... Learn more about the Zaporizhia region in southern Ukraine by visiting the following entries:\n\nZAPORIZHIA. A city (2016 pop 754,619) on the Dnipro River and the administrative center of Zaporizhia oblast and raion. It is a river port, a railway junction, and the second-largest industrial city in the Dnipro Industrial Region. Until 1921 the city was called Oleksandrivske. The city grew up around Oleksandrivske fortress, which was built in 1770, and which formed a link in the defensive front (the Dnipro Line) against the Crimean Khanate. The Zaporizhia Cossack stronghold of Khortytsia Island had been located on the island opposite the new settlement. After Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 1783, the fortress lost its military importance. Many of its demobilized soldiers settled in or around Oleksandrivske, which became a small administrative-commercial town. From 1806 it was a county center in Katerynoslav gubernia. Oleksandrivske's rapid growth did not begin until the 1870s. After being linked by railroad transportation to Moscow in 1873 and Sevastopol in 1875, the town became a major transfer point, at which commodities (notably grain) were transferred from rail to river barges for shipment downriver to the seaports. At the same time its own industry, particularly agricultural machine building, developed. By 1910 there were three large machine-building plants in Oleksandrivske. The completion of a railway line from the Donbas to Kryvyi Rih in 1902 stimulated the growth of metallurgy. The city's population grew from approximately 7,000 in 1885 to 19,000 in 1897 and 38,000 in 1910. The city in 1897 was 43 percent Ukrainian, 28 percent Jewish, and 25 percent Russian... Today Zaporizhia is the sixth-largest city in Ukraine...\n\nZaporizhia\n\nKHORTYTSIA ISLAND. The largest island in the Dnipro River, situated south of the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station and now a part of the city of Zaporizhia. It is 12 km long and 2.5 km wide, and covers an area of over 3,000 ha. The island was located on 'the route from the Varangians to the Greeks' and was first mentioned as Saint Gregory's Island in the mid-10th century. In 972 Prince Sviatoslav I Ihorovych died in battle against the Pechenegs at the nearby Dnipro Rapids. The princes of Kyivan Rus' under Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych gathered on the island in 1103 to begin their campaign against the Cumans. In 1224 the Kyivan Rus' princes conferred there before engaging the Tatars in battle. The island played an important role in the Cossack wars with the Tatars and Poles. In the 1550s Prince Dmytro Vyshnevetsky built a Cossack fortress 10 km north on Mala Khortytsia Island, which served as a bulwark against various invaders. With brief intervals, a garrison of registered Cossacks was stationed on Khortytsia Island between 1596 and 1648. In the 1660s and 1670s the Zaporozhian kish otaman Ivan Sirko used the island as his military base. The island was part of the territory held by the Zaporozhian Sich until its destruction in 1775. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1735-9 a fortress and shipyard were built there in 1737... In 1965 the island was designated to be a historical-cultural preserve. In 2007 the Zaporozhian Sich historical complex was built there. Several health resorts and sanatoriums are located on the island which today is used primarily for recreational purposes...\n\nKhortytsia Island\n\nBERDIANSK. A city (2016 pop 114,205) in Zaporizhia oblast, raion center and port on the northern shore of the Sea of Azov. From 1939 to 1958 it was called Osypenko. Berdiansk was founded in 1827 on the site of the Nogay-Tatar village of Kutur-Ohla near the Berda River. A port from 1836, in 1842 it became a county town of Tavriia gubernia. As a result of trade (it became an important wheat-exporting port), it grew considerably--from a population of 10,100 in 1860 to 26,500 in 1897. After a decline during the revolution (1926 pop 26,400, of which 63 percent were Russians and 22 percent Ukrainians), there was a period of significant growth in the 1930s as a result of industrialization (1939 pop 52,000, 1959 pop 65,000, and 1970 pop 100,000). The city has a cable factory (the Azovkabel factory), an agricultural machine plant, a construction and road-building machine plant, a hydraulic machinery plant, a petroleum byproducts and petrochemical plant; as well as a shoe, a clothing, and a food-processing (specializing in seafood) plant. It also has a pedagogical university (founded in 1932) and an university of business and management; an airport; machine-building, grape-growing and winemaking, and medical tekhnikums; a regional museum (founded in 1930); and an art museum.

A city (2016 pop 13,994) on the Haichur River and a raion center in Zaporizhia oblast. It was founded in the 1770s as a military outpost in a defensive line against the Crimean Khanate. In 1785 it was expanded into a military settlement. From 1859 annual fairs were taking part in Huliai-Pole and the village developed into a small town, a local trade and manufacturing center. From 1917 to 1921 Huliai-Pole was the center of Nestor Makhno's anarchist activity (see Partisan movement in Ukraine, 1918-22). It was granted city status in 1938 and became a raion center. The city has agricultural-machinery, automobile-repair, paint, consumer-products, food-processing, mixed-feed, and shoe plants. It also has a regional studies museum the largest exposition in which is dedicated to Nestor Makhno and his partisan movement...\n\nHuliaipole\n\nMELITOPOL or MELITOPIL. A city (2016 pop 155,595) on the Molochna River and raion center in Zaporizhia oblast. A frontier settlement was established at the site in 1784. In 1816 it was named Novooleksandrivka, and in 1841 renamed Melitopol. From 1841 to 1923 Melitopol was a county center in Tavriia gubernia and then Zaporizhia gubernia. On 18 June 1918 the Army of the Ukrainian National Republic defeated the Red Army near the town. During the Soviet period Melitopol developed into an industrial city. Its chief industries are machine building (automobile engines, refrigerators, tractor parts), metalworking, light industry, and the food industry. Its institutions of higher education are the Tavriia State Agrotechnological University and the Melitopol State Pedagogical University (est 1922). It has a regional museum.

A knoll of sandstone deposits from the Miocene epoch resembling a large kurhan, situated near Terpinnia, Melitopol raion, Zaporizhia oblast. Beneath it 65 caves have been discovered to date containing ancient petroglyphs of wild bulls, wolves, horses, and other animals, human beings, and geometric patterns dating back to the Upper Paleolithic Period, the Mesolithic Period, and the Bronze Age, when this was a site of religious worship. The first caves were discovered by Nikolai Veselovsky in 1890 and were investigated in 19368, the 1950s, the 1970s. Between 1983 and 2006 extensive excavations of the site were conducted by archeologist Borys Mykhailov who discovered numerous new caves and grottos. It is estimated that the oldest petroglyphs in Kamiana Mohyla date back to 22nd millennium BC.

UKRAINE'S SOUTHERN BOUNDARY: THE BLACK SEA AND THE SEA OF AZOV\n\nThe coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov form the natural boundary of the Ukrainian territories in the south. These seas link Ukraine with the world. Since ancient times economic, political, and cultural influences from the south have reached Ukraine via the Black Sea. They easily penetrated to the interior of Ukrainian territory along the rivers that flow into the sea: the Danube River, Dnister River, Boh River, and particularly Dnipro River. For many centuries three expansion routes intersected on the north coast of the Black Sea. The peoples that inhabited Ukraine tried to reach the Black Sea, while the Mediterranean peoples--Greeks, Byzantines, Italians--strove to occupy its most northerly coast. But the steppes along the northern coast were continually invaded by nomadic hordes from Asia. The struggle for the northern coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov lasted for centuries, and the Ukrainian people established a permanent boundary on the Black Sea only at the close of the 18th century... Learn more about the history, nature, and geopolitical importance of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov by visiting the following entries:\n\nBLACK SEA. An interior sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean by several straits and the Aegean and Mediterranean seas. It lies between the East European massif in the north and Asia Minor in the south, between Caucasia in the east and the Balkan Peninsula in the west. Today the Black Sea coast is divided among Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania. The Black Sea was known under various names in the past. The ancient Greeks called it at one time Pontos Axeinos (the Hostile Sea), because of its storminess and lack of islands. After colonizing its coast, the Greeks renamed it Pontos Euxeinos (the Hospitable Sea). Arab travelers and writers called it the Rus' Sea. The Kyiv Chronicle referred to it as the Pontic or Ponetian Sea. Eventually, various nations adopted the name Black Sea...\n\nBlack Sea\n\nBLACK SEA NATURE RESERVE. A state preserve located on the sandy banks of the lower Dnipro River and the coast and the islands of the Tendriv Bay and Yahorlyk Bay of the Black Sea. The preserve was established in 1927. It covers 9,421 ha of dry land and 24,700 ha of water (in 1976, 64,806 ha). It was created to protect nesting, wintering, and migrating birds and to preserve the natural environment. The steppe section of the preserve?the Yahorlyk Kut Peninsula and Potiivka?consists of the remains of the Black Sea steppes and is inhabited by such rare birds as the great bustard, the little bustard, and the white-tailed eagle and smaller animals such as the acclimatized bobac. In the forest-steppe sections are found the remains of island forests and small groves of oak, birch, and willow trees...\n\nBlack Sea Nature Reserve\n\nSEA OF AZOV. A shallow branch of the Black Sea, connected to it by the Kerch Strait. It covers a part of the Black Sea Depression lying between the Donets Ridge and the Azov Upland in the north and the foothills of the Crimean Mountains and the Caucasus Mountains in the south. It is located between mainland Ukraine in the north, the Crimea in the west, and the Kuban region in the east. The Sea of Azov was important in ancient times when Greek colonies were founded on its shores. These city-states belonged to the Bosporan Kingdom, which eventually gained control of the entire Azov coast. The ancient city-states on the Azov coast fell to the invading Huns in the 4th century. The Antes were the first Slavic people to settle in the Azov area (4th?7th century). Later a Slavic tribe, the Siverianians, occupied this land...\n\nSea of Azov\n\nAZOV-SYVASH GAME PRESERVE. Located in the area of the Sea of Azov and Syvash Lake, the preserve covers an area of 6,850 ha including sandy Byriuchyi Island and the loess islands of Kuiuk-Tuk and Churiuk. The preserve was formed in 1957 out of a reservation established in 1927. The steppe vegetation includes about 240 species. The red deer and the pheasant have been acclimatized on Byriuchyi Island, and the buck and the wild goat have been reacclimatized. The purpose of the preserve is to protect the steppe and coastal flora, particularly waterfowl during their southward migration and wintering...\n\nAzov-Syvash Game Preserve\n\nTAHANRIH BAY.

THE SUMY REGION AND ITS RICH HISTORICAL HERITAGE\n\nThe territory of the present-day Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine was settled as early as the Paleolithic period. In the 9th to 11th centuries it belonged to Kyivan Rus', and in the 11th to 13th centuries, to Chernihiv and Siversk principalities. It was under Tatar control until the mid-14th century, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into the region. In the 16th century the southern and western parts of the region came under Polish control, and the northern parts (notably Putyvl) fell under Russian control. After Bohdan Khmelnytsky's uprising and the Cossack-Polish War of 1648-57 the northern and western reaches of the Sumy region became part of the Hetman state, and the southern and eastern areas became part of Slobidska Ukraine. It was in the 18th century that this region gained a particular importance in Ukrainian history when Hlukhiv became the capital of the Left-Bank hetmans and one of the important centres of Ukrainian political and cultural life... Learn more about the Sumy region and its historical heritage by visiting the following entries:\n\nSUMY. A city (2011 pop 270,039) at the confluence of the Psol River and the Sumka River and an oblast center. It was founded in 1652 by peasants and Cossacks from Bila Tserkva regiment in Right-Bank Ukraine led by Colonel Herasym Kondratiev. The new settlement was soon fortified to protect the territory from the Tatars. Located on the Putyvl-Moscow trade route, the town prospered. In 1660-1732 its population grew from 2,700 to 7,700. It was the center of Sumy regiment (1658-1765) and the seat of administration for all the regiments of Slobidska Ukraine (1732-43). Then it became the center of Sumy province of Slobidska Ukraine gubernia (1765-80) and a county center in Kharkiv vicegerency (1780-96), Slobidska Ukraine gubernia (1796-1835), and Kharkiv gubernia (1835-1923). By the mid-19th century Sumy was a well-established industrial and trading town: it had a glass factory (est 1710), three tanneries, a coach works, four brick factories, four candle works, a soap factory, and four major fairs a year. In 1732 it had five schools...\n\nSumy\n\nHLUKHIV. City (2001 pop 35,800) on the Yesman River and a raion center in Sumy oblast. Mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle under the year 1152 as a city in Chernihiv principality, in the 13th and 14th centuries it was the capital of an appanage principality. In the mid 13th century Hlukhiv was captured by the Mongols. In the 1350s the region came under Lithuanian rule; it was annexed by Muscovy in 1503 and by Poland in 1618 at which time the city was granted the rights of Magdeburg law. Part of the Hetman state from 1648 on, Hlukhiv was an important trade center and a company town in the Nizhyn regiment. The Hlukhiv Articles were signed here in 1669. After the destruction of Baturyn, Hlukhiv was (during the years 1708-22 and 1727-64) the capital of the Left-Bank hetmans. The city underwent periods of particularly rapid growth under the rule of Hetman Danylo Apostol (1727-34) and Hetman Kyrylo Rozumovsky (1750-64), elected at the Hlukhiv Council of 1750. The renown Hlukhiv Singing School was established there in 1738...\n\nHlukhiv\n\nPUTYVL (or PUTYVEL). A town (2011 pop 16,329) on the Seim River and a raion center in Sumy oblast. It was first mentioned, as a fortress, in the Hypatian Chronicle under the year 1146. Putyvl was established in 988 at the crossroads of several trade routes. From the 12th century until 1523 Putyvl was the center of an appanage principality, which was part of Kyivan Rus', the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1356-1503), and Muscovy. The town, which is described in Slovo o polku Ihorevi, withstood a Cuman siege in 1186. In 1239 it was destroyed by Batu Khan's horde. In 1618 it was captured by Hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny. As Slobidska Ukraine became colonized in the 17th century, Putyvl lost its strategic importance. In the 19th century it was a county center of Kursk gubernia. In 1926 it became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Today Putyvl's main industries are food processing and tourism. In 1988 Putyvl, with its numerous architectural monuments, was declared a historical and cultural reserve...\n\nPutyvl (or Putyvel)\n\nKONOTOP (or KONOTIP). City (2011 pop 93,377) and raion center in Sumy oblast under oblast jurisdiction, situated on the Yezuch River. Konotop was first mentioned in a historical document in 1634. From 1654 to 1781 it was a fortified company town in Nizhyn regiment. In the summer of 1659 during the Ukrainian-Muscovite War, it was besieged for three months by Prince A. Trubetskoi's army and defended by Colonel Hryhorii Hulianytsky. On 8 July 1659 Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky, who came to the town's aid, scored his first great victory known as the Battle of Konotop, killing or scattering 30,000 Russians and capturing 5,000. In 1664 Konotop was destroyed by the Poles. From 1782 to the early 1920s it was a county town, from 1802 in Chernihiv gubernia. From 1923 to 1932 it was an okruha center, and from 1932 to 1939 a raion center, in Chernihiv oblast. Its development began only after it became a junction on the Kyiv-Voronezh railway in the mid 19th century. Its major industries are machine building industry and metalworking industry...\n\nKonotop (or Konotip)\n\nROMNY (or ROMEN). A city (2011 pop 43,937) at the junction of the Romen River and the Sula River and a raion center in Sumy oblast.

The territory of this regiment suffered extensive damage during the Russo-Swedish conflict of 1708-9 and the Russo-Turkish war of 1735-9. Following the abolition of the Hetman state and the Cossack order, the Okhtyrka Cossack regiment was transformed into a hussar regiment and the territory became part of Slobidska Ukraine gubernia. In 1835, after the dissolution of this gubernia, Okhtyrka became part of Kharkiv gubernia. Starting from the early 18th century Okhtyrka became a regional center of crafts and industry. In 1718 the first tobacco manufacture in Ukraine (and the Russian Empire) was established there. Today it has a machine building industry, a petroleum industry, a light industry, and a food industry.

THE PICTURESQUE TRANSCARPATHIA: THE WESTERNMOST REGION OF UKRAINE\n\nTranscarpathia is the only part of Ukraine situated beyond the Carpathian Mountains. Accessible to the main territory of Ukraine through numerous mountain passes, it joins Ukraine with the core of East-Central Europe. Transcarpathia encompasses two different natural regions, the Tysa Lowland and the picturesque southern watershed of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. The Slavic colonization of Transcarpathia began in the 2nd century, with migration from the north across the mountain passes. By the 8th and 9th centuries the lowlands of Transcarpathia were fairly densely peopled by White Croatians (at the time inhabiting both the north and the south side of the Carpathians). In the 10th century, Transcarpathia came under the sphere of influence of Kyivan Rus'. Following its incorporation by Prince Volodymyr the Great into his realm, the name Rus' or Ruthenia became entrenched in Transcarpathia. In the 11th century most of Transcarpathia came under Hungarian rule. Ukrainians constituted the majority of the region's population, but they were a minority element among its aristocracy. Deprived of a political structure and social elite the Transcarpathian Ukrainians preserved their ethnic identity principally through their religious distinction. Mukachevo was the seat of an Orthodox Mukachevo eparchy (first mentioned in 1491), the religion of which was merely tolerated in Hungary, and the clergy and monasteries of which were dependent on the goodwill of the local gentry. Despite its political separation the spiritual contacts of Transcarpathia with other Ukrainian lands were close. Liturgical and theological books published in Kyiv and Lviv were used widely in Transcarpathia and in the 17th and 18th centuries a local religious literature developed there, resembling in character Ukrainian baroque literature, with minor Hungarian and Slovak influences. It was not until the early 1920s that Transcarpathia was established as a separate administrative region. The Ukrainians' struggle for self-rule resulted in the creation of the autonomous Carpatho-Ukraine on 11 October 1938. On 12 February 1939, elections to the first parliament of Carpatho-Ukraine took place in which the Ukrainian National Alliance won a resounding victory. However, on 14 March 1939, Adolf Hitler entrusted Hungary with the occupation of Transcarpathia which marked the actual beginning of the Second World War... Learn more about Transcarpathia, its history, cities, inhabitants, and natural resources by visiting the following entries:\n\nTRANSCARPATHIA. A historical-geographic region in southwestern Ukraine, incorporating the southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains and a portion of the adjoining Tysa Lowland. Until 1919 Transcarpathia denoted that part of Hungary where Ukrainians lived, and the synonymous terms Hungarian Ruthenia (Uhorska Rus') and Hungarian Ukraine (Uhorska Ukraina) were widely used. Bounded by the ethnographic boundary with Romanians and Hungarians in the south and Slovaks in the west, the region encompassed 15,600 sq km. After the First World War Transcarpathia was separated from Hungary, and the bulk of its territory was formed into an autonomous region within Czechoslovakia called Subcarpathian Ruthenia (Pidkarpatska Rus') or Carpatho-Ukraine. A small part of Transcarpathia, located south of the Tysa River became part of Romania (Maramures region); in Transcarpathia's western reaches, the Presov region was allocated to Slovakia. A narrow strip of Hungarian ethnographic territory was added to Carpatho-Ukraine. Within Czechoslovakia Transcarpathia played an important geopolitical role as the bridge linking Czechoslovakia with Romania. At the same time it separated Hungary from its traditional ally, Poland. Later, Transcarpathia provided the USSR with a foothold in the Pannonian Plain. Beginning in 1938 the borders of Carpatho-Ukraine underwent a number of changes. After the Vienna Arbitration, Carpatho-Ukraine was transferred as a dependency to Hungary. Within the borders of Ukraine Transcarpathia occupies almost the same territory as it did within prewar Czechoslovakia, with a slight increase in the southwest around Chop. It constitutes a separate administrative unit, Transcarpathia oblast, with a territory of 12,800 sq km and a population of 1,258,155 (2018)...\n\nTranscarpathia\n\nUZHHOROD. A city (2019 pop 114,897) on the Uzh River and the capital of Transcarpathia oblast. According to the archeological evidence the site was inhabited as early as the Stone Age. A Slavic tribe of White Croatians founded a fortified settlement there in the 8th or 9th century. Early in the 10th century it was controlled by the Hungarians and then by Kyivan Rus'. Hungary regained control of the town in the 11th century and remained the dominant influence there until the 20th century. Uzhhorod was sacked by the Tatars in 1242, and its fortress was destroyed. Its economy was initially based on wine-making industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Trade and manufacturing, stimulated by the town's military and administrative needs, developed through the 15th to 18th centuries. The religious struggle of the 17th century culminated in the Uzhhorod Union of 1646. The Austrian Habsburg dynasty won control of Uzhhorod in 1691, and the city became involved in Hungarian attempts to throw off Austrian rule--in the Rakoczi uprising of 1703-11 and the Revolution of 1848-9. With the defeat of the revolution the Ukrainian cultural movement in Uzhhorod gained strength for a time. The Society of Saint Basil the Great, the Uniia publishing society, and Ukrainian schools were established. In 1848 the city was granted self-government, and began the process of modernization. With Transcarpathia's incorporation into Czechoslovakia after the First World War, Uzhhorod became the capital of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, the seat of the governor and the administration, and a center of Ukrainian life...\n\nUzhhorod\n\nMUKACHEVO. A city (2019 pop 85,881) on the Liatorytsia River and a raion center in Transcarpathia oblast. The site has been settled since prehistoric times. Archeologists have discovered settlements in the vicinity from the Neolithic Period, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and the Slavic period (8th-9th century AD). In the 10th century Mukachevo belonged to Kyivan Rus', and in the 11th century, to Hungary. The fortress, rising high above the town, was destroyed by the Cumans in 1086 and by the Tatars in 1241. It was rebuilt by Prince Fedir Koriiatovych, who also built Mukachevo Saint Nicholas's Monastery. By the end of the 14th century Mukachevo was an important manufacturing and trading center on a trade route between Hungary and Galicia. In 1445 it was granted the rights of Magdeburg law. Because of the monastery the town became a cultural and religious center in the 15th century, and until the end of the 18th century it was the seat of the Mukachevo eparchy. Owing to its strategic location Mukachevo was contested frequently by the Habsburg dynasty and Transylvanian dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries. At the end of the 17th century the town was annexed by Austria. It flourished in the 18th century and became the chief trade center in Transcarpathia. Mukachevo played an important role in the revolutionary movement of 1848-9. After the First World War the city belonged to Czechoslovakia. Its importance diminished whereas that of Uzhhorod grew. In 1938 Mukachevo came under Hungarian rule. By a Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty of June 1945 Transcarpathia became part of Soviet Ukraine...\n\nMukachevo\n\nKHUST. City (2017 pop 28,473) and raion center in Transcarpathia oblast, situated on the Khustets River in the Maramures Basin. It arose in the 10th century at the foot of a mountain of volcanic origin, on which a Hungarian castle was built from 1090 to 1191 to control access to salt mines 50 km away near the future town of Solotvyna. It was razed by the Mongols in 1242 but was soon rebuilt. Khust belonged to the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia from 1281. In 1321 Hungarian rule was restored. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Habsburg dynasty and the Transylvanian princes fought each other for control of the town and its castle. It was besieged by the Crimean Tatars in 1594, 1659, and 1717, the Poles in 1657, and the Turks in 1661-2. Prince Ferenc II Rakoczi took the town in 1703 and convened a Transylvanian diet there in 1709. The castle burned down after lightning hit its gunpowder tower in 1766. A Ukrainian People's Council was founded there in November 1918. On 21 January 1919 the 425 delegates of the All-People's Congress of Hungarian Ruthenians in Khust created the Central Ruthenian People's Council and voted to unite Transcarpathia with Ukraine. From 1919 to 1938 the city belonged to Czechoslovakia, from 1928 as a county center. Branches of the Prosvita society and Dukhnovych Society were established there. After Hungary occupied southwestern Transcarpathia, in November 1938, the autonomous Carpatho-Ukrainian government headed by Avhustyn Voloshyn was evacuated from Uzhhorod to Khust, which became the capital of Carpatho-Ukraine...\n\nKhust\n\nBEREHOVE or Berehovo. A city (2019 pop 23,732, with a substantial Hungarian population), located in the Tysa Lowland; raion center in Transcarpathia oblast. Founded as a Saxon colony in the 11th century AD, Berehove is situated in Hungarian ethnic territory (before the Second World War Ukrainians constituted 10 percent of the population in Bereg komitat [Berehove county]). Under Czechoslovak rule it was a center of Ukrainian cultural life in southern Transcarpathia. A Ukrainian gymnasium was situated here. Berehove has furniture, clothing, brick-and-tile, and ceramics plants and a wine and food industry. Vineyards are located nearby. A 15th-century Gothic Roman Catholic church is located in the city. Berehove is a centre of cultural life of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. A Hungarian pedagogical institute, the Transcarpathian Hungarian Institute--the only institution of this kind in Ukraine--is located in Berehove...\n\nBerehove\n\nVYNOHRADIV. A city (2018 pop 25,462) on the Tysa River and a raion center in Transcarpathia oblast. Until 1946 it was known as Sevliush or Sevlus. The settlement originated in the 9th century around the Slavic fortress of Kanko. At the end of the 11th century it came under Hungarian rule and was renamed Sevliush. At the end of the 17th century it was annexed by Austria, and in 1919 it was awarded to Czechoslovakia. Officially part of Ukraine since 1945, it was granted city status in 1946. Today the city is an industrial and communications center. It is the home of the Elektron Manufacturing Consortium, a plastic sanitary-products plant, and sewing, footwear, canning, and cheese factories. Its architectural monuments include the remains of the medieval castle, the Perenyi palace (15th century), a Franciscan church (14th-15th century), and a 16th-century Church of the Elevation of the Cross...\n\nVynohradiv\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries dealing with the history, cities, and natural resources of Transcarpathia were made possible by the financial support of the CANADIAN FOUNDATION FOR UKRAINIAN STUDIES.\n\nXXIX. THE HISTORICAL REGION OF VOLHYNIA IN NORTHWESTERN UKRAINE\n\nThe name of Volhynia (Volyn), a historical region in northwestern Ukraine, probably comes from a fortified town from before the 10th century, located at the confluence of the Buh River and the Huchva River. The first historical name of the people of Volhynia was Dulibians. In the 10th century that name was replaced by Buzhanians and Volhynians. In 981 and 993 Prince Volodymyr the Great of Kyiv secured the lands along the Sian River and beyond the Buh River and built Volodymyr-Volynskyi (988), which he gave to his son, Vsevolod. In the 990s a Volhynian eparchy was established. From 1015 to 1030 Volhynia was the battleground of Polish-Rus' wars. In the late 12th century Prince Roman Mstyslavych established a large state encompassing Volhynia, Galicia, and Kyiv and known as the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. In 1349 this state was partitioned, and Volhynia fell under the control of Prince Liubartas and became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 15th and 16th centuries the Orthodox princely and noble families (most notably, the Ostrozky princes) consolidated their privileged positions in Volhynia. After the Union of Lublin (1569) Volhynia became a Polish crown voivodeship without losing its internal autonomy and Ukrainian character. The union, however, accelerated the Polonization of the administration and the upper estates of Volhynia. The struggle against Roman Catholicism and the Ukrainian national-cultural movement at the beginning of the 17th century was expressed in the writings of the opponents and the supporters of the Church Union of Berestia (1596). During Bohdan Khmelnytsky's uprising some of the battles of the Cossack-Polish War of 1648-57 took place in Volhynia. Nevertheless Volhynia never became part of the Hetman state but remained a province of Poland. After Bohdan Khmelnytsky's death heavy Polish oppression and Tatar raids forced much of the Ukrainian population to emigrate to Left-Bank Ukraine. The Ukrainian nobility in Volhynia lost its political significance. After the partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, and 1795) Volhynia, with the exception of the southern part of Kremianets county, became part of the Russian Empire. The process of the Ukrainian national rebirth began in Volhynia only during the Ukrainian struggle for independence in 1917-21, but in 1921 the region was partitioned according to the Peace Treaty of Riga: the eastern part was annexed by the Ukrainian SSR, the western part by Poland. After 1945 practically the entire region of Volhynia was united within the borders of the Ukrainian SSR...

A historical region of northwestern Ukraine, located north of Podilia, south of Polisia, east of the Buh River, and west of the upper parts of the Teteriv River and the Uzh River. Its area is approximately 70,000 sq km, and its population exceeds 4 million. Volhynia's borders have changed considerably over the centuries, shifting consistently from west to east. In the 12th century the Volhynia principality was larger than the present region. It extended to the Wieprz River in the west and to the Narev River and the Yaselda River in the northwest and thus encompassed the present Kholm region and Podlachia. Until 1170 it also encompassed the Belz land in the south. Under Poland the smaller Volhynia voivodeship (1569-1793) did not reach west beyond the Buh River, but included new territory to the east and southeast. Within the Russian Empire Volhynia gubernia consisted approximately of the same territory, except for the Zbarazh region, but expanded east to the upper Teteriv and the Uzh rivers. Even its capital, Zhytomyr, belonged once to Kyiv principality, not Volhynia principality. Today Volhynia encompasses most of Volhynia oblast, Rivne oblast, and Zhytomyr oblast, and parts of the former Volhynia gubernia belong to other oblasts--the Kremianets region, to Ternopil oblast, and the Iziaslav (Zaslav) and the Starokostiantyniv regions, to Khmelnytskyi oblast...\n\nVolhynia\n\nLUTSK. A city (2013 pop 215,624) on the Styr River and the center of Volhynia oblast. It is first mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle under the year 1085, but it was probably a tribal center of the Luchanians as early as the 10th century. There is evidence that the area was settled in the Neolithic Period. Lutsk was the capital of an independent principality from 1154. In 1225 it belonged to Volodymyr principality and later to Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. In 1340 it was annexed by Liubartas, who built a castle there and established Lutsk as the capital of an appanage principality within the Lithuanian-Ruthenian state. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the city came under Polish rule and served as a center of Volhynia voivodeship. In the 15th and 16th centuries it was one of the main trade centers in Ukraine because of its location at the crossroads of major trade routes. The city was also an important Ukrainian religious and cultural center. In 1617 the Lutsk Brotherhood of the Elevation of the Cross was founded, and in 1621 it set up a school. Later in the 17th century Lutsk declined. It was annexed by Russia in 1795, and became a county center. Today the city's most important historic monument is Liubartas's castle, the baroque Roman Catholic church built in 1619-20, the Church of the Holy Protectress, reconstructed from its 15th-century ruins, and the Church of the Elevation of the Cross, rebuilt in 1890 from the remains of the brotherhood's church (1619-20)...\n\nLutsk\n\nRIVNE. A city (2013 pop 250,333) on the Ustia River and the administrative center of Rivne oblast. The town developed out of a settlement around a fortress in the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. It is first mentioned in historical documents in 1282. In the second half of the 14th century it became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and by the end of the century it had been granted the rights of Magdeburg law. Because of its convenient location on the Kyiv--Volodymyr-Volynskyi trade route the town prospered as a commercial center. In 1518-1621 it was owned by the Ostrozky princes. With the Union of Lublin (1569) Rivne became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. With the partitioning of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by Russia. Toward the end of the 19th century Rivne developed from a small administrative and trading town into a major railway junction. Its population jumped from 6,300 in 1870 to 24,600 in 1897 and 33,700 in 1911. From the 1890s over half the population was Jewish. In 1941 the city was captured by the Germans and turned into the administrative center for Reichskommissariat Ukraine. In 1941 and 1942 the Germans killed the majority of local Jews. Soviet troops reoccupied Rivne in 1944. Since the 1950s Rivne has developed rapidly as an industrial center and the city remains an important railway junction. Its chief architectural monuments are the Dormition Church and belfry (1756), the gymnasium building (1839), and the Resurrection Cathedral (1890)...\n\nRivne\n\nVOLODYMYR-VOLYNSKYI. A city (2013 pop 38,894) on the Luha River and a raion center in Volhynia oblast. One of Ukraine's oldest cities, it is first mentioned in the chronicles under the year 988, as the fortified trading town of Volodymyr and the seat of an eparchy. In the 12th century it was the center of Volodymyr principality, and in 1199 it became part of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. Frequent Tatar attacks (1240, 1260, 1491, and 1500) brought about its decline. In the late 14th century it came under Lithuanian rule, and in 1431 it obtained the rights of Magdeburg law. From 1569 the town belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Prince Kostiantyn Vasyl Ostrozky set up a school there in 1577, and a Basilian college operated there in the 18th century. In 1795 the town was annexed by the Russian Empire. It was renamed Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and served as a county center in Volhynia gubernia. During the First World War the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen opened the first Ukrainian school there, in 1916. In the interwar period Volodymyr-Volynskyi was a county center under Polish rule. Today the city is an industrial and communications center. Its chief architectural monuments are the remains of the 12th- to 13th-century fortifications, the foundations of 10th- to 14th-century residential buildings, the Dormition Cathedral in Volodymyr-Volynskyi (1160), Saint Basil's Church (13th-14th century), and the Renaissance bishops' palace (16th century)...\n\nVolodymyr-Volynskyi\n\nOSTROH or OSTRIH. A city (2013 pop 16,658) at the junction of the Viliia River and the Horyn River and a raion center in Rivne oblast. It is first mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle under the year 1100. In the second half of the 14th century it came under Lithuanian rule. From 1386 Ostroh belonged to the Ostrozky family, who built a castle and the Church of the Epiphany and established Ostroh as an important cultural, religious, and economic center. Until 1630 the town was a leading center of Ukrainian Orthodoxy: in the 1570s an academy and a printing press were set up, and in 1581 an improved translation of the Bible was published there. As the Roman Catholic movement and the state's policy of Polonization increased in strength, Ostroh lost its cultural and religious role. It was captured by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1648, and the castle and church were destroyed in the process. In the second half of the 17th century Ostroh became the property of the Zaslawski family, the Wisniowiecki family (in 1673), and finally the Sanguszko family (in 1700). In 1793, with the partition of Poland, it was transferred to Russia, and became a county center in Volhynia gubernia. Today the town's architectural monuments include the remains of the castle (14th-16th century), the 15th-century Church of the Epiphany, a 17th-century synagogue, and a 19th-century academy complex. In 1994, the Ostroh Academy was reestablished and in 2000 it was renamed the Ostroh Academy National University...\n\nOstroh or Ostrih\n\nDUBNO. City (2013 pop 38,035) on the Ikva River in western Volhynia; raion center in Rivne oblast. It was first mentioned in 1100 as the village of Duben. In 1498 Dubno received Magdeburg law and came under the control of the Ostrozky princes. In the 15th century a fortress was built there that played an important role during the Cossack-Polish War in mid 17th century and survived until the First World War. The Dubno Monastery was founded by Prince Kostiantyn Ostrozky in the late 16th century. Yov Zalizo was the monastery's first hegumen (from 1584 to 1597). Originally an Orthodox monastery, it was taken over by the Catholic church in 1700, but reverted to Orthodox control in the 19th century. Because of its fairs Dubno was a trade center, particularly from 1774 to 1797 when the famous Lviv contract fair was transferred to Dubno. Under Polish and Russian rule the town was a county center known for its trade in hops and cultural activities. Today it has some small industry: a food industry, a woolen-cloth industry, a furniture factory, and a foundry-machinery plant. It has a regional studies museum. Among its architectural monuments are the castle of the Ostrozky princes (16th century), the Lutsk Gate (15th and 16th centuries), the Transfiguration Church (16th century), Saint Nicholas's Church (17th century), Saint George's Church (1700), Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos (17th century)...\n\nDubno\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries about the historical region of Volhynia in northwestern Ukraine were made possible by the financial support of the PETER SALYGA ENDOWMENT FUND at the CANADIAN INSTITUTE OF UKRAINIAN STUDIES (Edmonton, AB, Canada).\n\nXXX. THE ZHYTOMYR REGION AND CENTRAL POLISIA\n\nThe territory of central Polisia, also known as Zhytomyr Polisia, in northern Ukraine was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic Period (10,000-8000 BC). Toward the end of the 1st century AD it was occupied by the tribe of Derevlianians. They lived to the southeast and south of the Prypiat River and their main towns were Korosten and Ovruch. In fact, the Yaselda-Prypiat line, which now forms the ethnic border between Ukrainians and Belarusians, marked off tribal territories long ago. In the 10th to 12th centuries central Polisia was part of Kyivan Rus' and then of Volodymyr-Volynskyi principality and the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. After the collapse of the Galician-Volhynian state the whole of Polisia became part of Lithuania. In the middle of the 15th century most of the region was administered by the Olelkovych princes of Kyiv. After the Union of Lublin in 1569 Polisia was divided: the northern part remained in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, whereas the southern part was acquired by Poland. Polisia gained importance in Ukraine's history during the Tatar conquest of the forest-steppe in the 13th century and the Crimean Tatar raids after the mid-15th century. A large proportion of the Ukrainian population of the forest-steppe sought refuge in Polisia, which was less vulnerable to attack. After the partitions of Poland the whole of Polisia was incorporated into the Russian Empire. This region, including central Polisia, was the most neglected and poorest part of Ukrainian territories within the Russian Empire. Expeditions which drained some parts of the region and railroad transportation brought a significant improvement in Polisia's economy in the 19th century. During Ukraine's struggle for independence in 1917-18 the whole of Ukrainian Polisia, in accordance with the Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, became part of the Ukrai"
