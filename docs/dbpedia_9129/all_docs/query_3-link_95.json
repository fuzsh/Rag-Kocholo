At the same time, it should be noted that we are constantly\n\nregistering attempts by individuals to infiltrate mainland Ukraine to engage in subversive and\n\nsabotage activities from the temporarily occupied territory (Law of Ukraine No. 1207-VII On the\n\nProtection of Rights and Freedoms of Citizens in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine,\n\nwhich took effect on May 15, 2014). We also record daily attempts to deliver means of terror,\n\nweapons, ammunition, and cash intended to fund mercenaries.\n\nThe Administration of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine would also like to remark that,\n\nunfortunately, we did not receive a single response to our letters between March 3 and May 16,\n\n2014.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, please be informed that we prepared and forwarded to you a letter of\n\nMay 15, 2014, which will be handed over to you in person by Major-General O.I.

Kulishov\n\nDear Colonel-General,\n\nYesterday the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine informed the Border Guard Service of the\n\nFederal Security Service of Russia about a possible attempt by a large number of militants to\n\nbreak through into Ukrainian territory (Letter No. 0.42-4048/0/6-14 of May 26, 2014 addressed\n\nto Colonel-General V.M. Dorokhin). Meanwhile, no response or any steps to prevent the illegal\n\ncrossing of the common state border followed.\n\nMoreover, one gets the impression that Russian border guards are facilitating the illegal\n\ncrossing of the common Ukrainian-Russian border by armed militants, thereby violating the\n\nprovisions of the August 3, 1994 Agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on\n\nCooperation and Interaction in Border-Related Issues, the May 31, 1997 Agreement on\n\nFriendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, and the\n\nrequirements of the Protocol between the Administration of the State Border Guard Service of\n\nUkraine and the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation governing the procedure for\n\nexchanging information about the situation at the state border of Ukraine and the Russian\n\nFederation dated September 26, 2008, as well as laws of the Russian Federation governing\n\nborder-related issues.\n\nFrom 10:30 p.m. on May 26 to 3:43 a.m. on May 27, Ukrainian border guards of the Biryukovo\n\nborder guard unit of the Luhansk Border Guard detachment observed the movement of vehicle\n\nconvoys on the adjoining side (in the direction of Novoprokhorovka (Russia) - Novoborovitsy\n\n(Ukraine) in the area of information post No. 68), which could not have passed unnoticed by\n\nRussian border guards. Moreover, border guard representatives of the Luhansk and Donetsk\n\nborder guard detachments informed their Russian colleagues about the movement of these\n\nvehicles through operative officers of the two sides, which was followed by a telephone\n\nconversation between the chiefs of directorates.\n\n2\n\nThe attempt to break through into Ukrainian territory began at 3:43 a.m. The militants open\n\neffective fire in response to warning shots fired by Ukrainian border patrols. The armed\n\nencounter ended at 4:22 a.m. Three passenger cars accompanying the convoy were detained,\n\nsix terrorists killed, one more wounded and taken prisoner as a result of the armed encounter.\n\nThe cars that were detained were found to contain automatic assault rifles, sniper rifles,\n\nhandheld grenade launchers, explosives and detonators.\n\nMeanwhile, six trucks and three passenger cars managed to break through in the direction of\n\nUkraine under the cover of massive fire and considering the small number of border patrols.\n\nThe militants that broke through the border are now preparing to storm the Sverdlovsk and\n\nBiryukovo border guard units of the Luhansk Border Guard detachment (as of 12:00 p.m. Kyiv\n\ntime).\n\nThe events of the past ten days, the lack of any response to our petitions, and the omission to\n\nact on the part of Russian border guards can be viewed by us as deliberate actions by the\n\nRussian side to undermine Ukraine’s efforts to deescalate the conflict in the region.\n\nWe believe that this position of the Russian side does not befit a partner but is rather a sign of\n\nRussia’s enmity.\n\nThe State Border Guard Service of Ukraine finds it possible to publish our petitions in the mass\n\nmedia, inform the border guard agencies of the CIS member states, the European Border and\n\nCoast Guard Agency (Frontex), as well as all international monitoring missions working in\n\nUkraine.\n\nBlame for possible consequences in the Ukrainian and Russia cross-border region rests with the\n\nBorder Guard Service of the Federal Security Service of Russia.\n\nChairman of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine\n\nUkrainian Army General [Signature] N.M.

They help armed individuals\n\nand military vehicles cross the border.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future, we propose joining our efforts\n\nto ensure the security of the common state border and bring to the attention of the\n\npublic in both countries, including via the mass media, the fact that any attempts to\n\ncross the border illegally will be immediately deterred by the relevant authorities of\n\nUkraine and the Russian Federation.\n\nChairman of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine\n\nUkrainian Army General [Signature] N.M.

The situation has not been contained. Instead, it has deteriorated further.\n\nThis morning, from 4:25 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. (Kyiv time), another border patrol on duty in the\n\nvicinity of Krasnaya Talovka (Ukraine) came under howitzer fire from Russian territory from an\n\narea in the vicinity of Novorusskiy (Russia).\n\nAlso, between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. in the direction of Voloshino (Russia) - Krasnaya\n\nTalovka (Ukraine), the border patrol detected an intrusion into the Ukrainian air space from the\n\nRussian Federation by a drone that flew up to 1,000 meters into Ukrainian territory directly\n\nabove the position of border patrols, which were subsequently targeted by the attack.\n\nI would yet again like to remind the Russian side that on July 14 and 28, 2014, roadside bombs\n\nand land mines were planted along routes traveled by Ukrainian border patrols near the state\n\nborder, and the border patrols came under mortar and assault rifle fire from the Russian side,\n\nwhich wounded our personnel and damaged our vehicles;\n\nOn July 5, 14 and 28, Ukrainian border guards serving both in the “green sector” of the border\n\nand at the border crossing point came under fire. The border crossing point came under fire\n\nfrom shoulder-fired missile launchers from the Russian side. Some of the border guards were\n\nseverely wounded. The infrastructure and the watch tower of the border crossing point have\n\nbeen destroyed.\n\n2\n\nWhile previously the Russian side would respond to all reports of the Ukrainian side about\n\nattacks on Ukrainian border patrols from the Russian side by saying (most recent letter No.\n\n26/929 of August 5, 2014) that the attacks did not come from Russian territory but instead\n\noriginated from the “opposing warring part” (or, in the words of the Ukrainian side, from\n\nterrorists and bandits), in this case the distance between positions of border patrols that came\n\nunder attack and positions of terrorists is more than 50 km, and any fire could possibly come\n\nonly from Russian territory.\n\nI would like to emphasize the total omission to act on the part of Russian border guards and\n\ntheir failure to defend the state "
