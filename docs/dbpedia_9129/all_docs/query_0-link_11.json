Guiteau;\n\n1901: Emma Goldman - Leon Czolgosz - Tadeusz Wolanski. 1963: George de Mohrenschildt - Lee Oswald - the Minsk province in Belarus.\n\nRussian political intelligence net and the Coup d'Etat in USA - William McKinley in September 1901 and John F. Kennedy in November 1963.\n\nCopyright by Bogdan Konstantynowicz, author, on 18th October 2019.\n\nSome quotes from studies on James Jesus Angleton (1917 - 1987):\n\nJames Jesus Angleton (1917 - 1987) was chief of CIA Counterintelligence from 1954 to 1975.\n\nAngleton grew up mostly in Italy, where his father owned the National Cash Register subsidiary. He attended an English preparatory school before entering Yale in 1937. He entered Harvard Law School and then joined the Army in 1943.\n\nAngleton was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services and first worked in the super-secret X-2 counterintelligence branch in London. In 1954, he became the head of the new Counterintelligence Staff.\n\n\"Among Mr. Petty's concerns was\n\nAngleton's once-close relationship with Kim Philby, who rose to the highest levels of the British intelligence service before he was unmasked as a Soviet mole in the early 1960s.\n\n... According to his unpublished memoir, Mr. Petty spent more than two years working secretly to investigate his supervisor. He gathered intricate details about Angleton's movements and close associates through the years, looking for - and finding, he thought -\n\nevidence that Angleton could have collaborated with the Soviets.\n\n... Mr. Petty admitted that it was a messy conclusion based largely on the circumstantial suggestion of guilt.\n\n'It was not a clear-cut case,' he told David Martin for 'Wilderness of Mirrors,' Martin's 1980 book about the Cold War-era CIA. Whatever his misgivings, Mr. Petty reported concerns about Angleton to agency superiors in 1974. He delivered several drawers full of notes and documents supporting his view, then spent at least 26 hours over the course of a week explaining his work to a senior officer in tape-recorded interviews. The price of that move was Mr. Petty's job - he retired almost immediately - and his reputation.\n\nHis accusation against Angleton was dismissed in a CIA study,\n\nand Mr. Petty remains one of the more controversial figures in the agency's history...\".\n\nJefferson Morley on the new JFK files:\n\n\"... Did you consider the possibility that Angleton himself may have been the mole as Clare Petty and Douglas Valentine suspected ...\n\nThere were at least four internal CIA studies that look at the issue of the mole after Petty made his allegation (Cram, Goodpastur, Fischer, and Hart). None came to the conclusion that Angleton was not the mole, and all came to the conclusion that there was no mole during Angleton's tenure.\n\nPetty's report has never been declassified so the details of his argument are unknown and impossible to judge. While Cleveland Cram's voluminous study of Angleton has not been made public, there is nothing in Cram's public comments to indicate that Cram saw evidence suggesting Angleton was the mole. Cram's personal papers on the subject were withdrawn from public view by the CIA when I began to research the issue. ...\n\nIn addition, I consulted the work of Christopher Andrew, semi-official historian of the British services and custodian of the Mitrokhin archive, the most complete collection of Soviet intelligence files available in the West. Andrew does not believe that Angleton was the mole. Nothing that has been published about the Mitrokhin archive supports the notion that Angleton was the mole. ...\"\n\nAngleton shaped CIA counterintelligence for 20 years from 1954 to 1974.\n\n\"... Angleton, some of them say, was a paranoid who effectively shut down Agency operations against the Soviet Union\".\n\nTennent H. Bagley insists that Nosenko's first contact with CIA in 1962 was designed to conceal\n\nthe presence of Soviet penetration agents who had been operating in US intelligence since at least the late 1950s and that his reappearance barely two months after the JFK murder was a risky change in the operation.\n\nClare Edward Petty was born 1920, in Norman, Oklahoma. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Oklahoma. Clare Edward Petty investigation of Heinz Felfe caught the attention of James Jesus Angleton, the head of the CIA's counter-intelligence unit.\n\nIn 1966 Petty joined the Special Investigations Group (SIG) and was given the task by Angleton to find the Soviet mole that Anatoli Golitsin had suggested had penetrated the CIA. Angleton suggested that Petty should take a close look at David Edmund Murphy.\n\n... Angleton's suspicions were increased by Murphy speaking fluent Russian and marrying a woman who had previously lived in the Soviet Union. Murphy had been accused of being a Soviet spy by one of his own officers, Peter Kapusta. Newton S. Miler, a member of SIG had investigated Murphy in the early 1960s.\n\nPetty concluded that a phrase in a letter from Michal Goleniewski, the Polish intelligence officer who called himself Sniper ... the KGB had advance knowledge that could only have come from a mole in the CIA.\n\nAngleton's mentor and friend, British intelligence officer Kim Philby, has been a longtime double agent for the Soviets.\n\nAs a result of this trauma, Angleton was about to become obsessed with searching for mole in the CIA itself, destroying the accomplishments and career of many agency officers.\n\nAllegedly his long-term investigations led to the paralysis of the CIA, disrupted the team and introduced general distrust, which ended with no significant successes.\n\nDavid Wise wrote:\n\n\"... Wise started a biography of Angleton ...\n\non the search for 'Sasha' - the alleged Soviet mole inside the CIA. Wise drew on many of Martin's and Mangold's sources but also turned up new information from previously silent Agency officers and in formerly classified records, including about compensation provided to victims of the molehunt. Wise also revealed details about the penetration agent, who did not damage CIA nearly as much as Angleton feared or as the molehunt itself did - although he goes well beyond the facts to claim that the search 'shattered' the Agency. ...\".\n\nAngleton died in 1987.\n\nIn later articles, Epstein did become more skeptical of the Angleton-Golitsyn interpretation of Soviet foreign policy. Most recently, he noted that the observation of Aldrich Ames's KGB handler that Angleton's suspicions about a mole inside CIA 'has the exquisite irony of a stalker following his victim in order to tell him he is not being followed'...\".\n\nDavid C. Martin does not identify where he got much of his specific information.\n\nAngleton initially cooperated with Martin but cut off contact when he learned that the author also was in touch with some of his critics. One of them was Clare Petty, an ex-CI Staff officer who had come to believe that Angleton was either a fraud or a KGB asset.\n\nFive months before landing in Normandy, Angleton's first meeting with Kim Philby came to an end.\n\nAccording to the historian Antony C. Brown \"at the meeting Angleton had ambitions, and had no appointment. It was Philby who suggested he take up the job - counter-intelligence. ... It was Kim who taught Angleton the structure of secret service, explained to him how he was intercepted. ...\n\nKim [Philby] became a mentor to James and a teacher.\n\nIf that was the case, Angleton quickly became independent ...\n\nKim was hired to work for the NKVD, and a few months later he became confident.\n\n... At the beginning of April 1944, Angleton learned that Princess Maria Pignatelli, the wife of influential politician and conspirator ... crossed the border between Allied and German troops and paid a visit to several high-ranking Wehrmacht officers. According to Angleton's informant, the duchess was to inform the Nazis of the planned Allied offensive in Italy ... the Duchess was registered by OSS as their agent. ... double agents.\n\n... Although the case came to light, and Poletti was shot by the British ...\n\nAngleton was about to use the Prince's connections. Immediately after the war he decided with Pignatelli create an organization fighting the Communist Party of Italy and supporting the right-wing forces of Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi. These actions were also supported by the British ... R5, its counterintelligence section also operating in Italy. Head of section in London was Kim Philby ...\".\n\nIn September 1945, the Consul General of the USSR Konstanty Wolkow reported to the British consul in Istanbul, offering in exchange for asylum ... information about Soviet spying in Turkey and the Middle East. ... his information showed that the Foreign Office and the SIS counter-intelligence had three NKWD agents. ... Information ... was sent to the head of the SIS \"C\", and for the hearing of ...\n\nPhilby, head of the Soviet section of counterintelligence.\n\nKim was going to Istanbul for three weeks ...\".\n\nEven without the sensational New York Times front-page story by Seymour Hersh in December 1974 about CIA domestic operations that prompted Angleton's dismissal, it was more than time for him to go, as even his longtime defender Richard Helms came to admit.\n\nPetty continued to search for the Soviet mole and eventually reached the conclusion that it was the man who had ordered the investigation, James Jesus Angleton, who had penetrated the CIA, and was in league with Anatoli Golitsin, who was not a genuine defector\n\n... PETTY:\n\nI began rethinking everything. If you turned the flip side it all made sense. Golitsin was sent to exploit Angleton. Then the next step, maybe not just an exploitation, and I had to extend it to Angleton. Golitsin might have been dispatched as the perfect man to manipulate Angleton ... Angleton was a mole, but he needed Golitsin to have a basis on which to act ... Golitsin was a support for things Angleton had wanted to do for years in terms of getting into foreign intelligence services. Golitsin's leads lent themselves to that. I concluded that logically Golitsin was the prime dispatched agent.\n\nIn 1971 Petty began \"putting stuff on index cards, formulating my theory\".\n\nPetty later told David C. Martin: The case against Angleton was a great compilation of circumstantial material. It was not a clear-cut case. ...\n\nPetty told James H. Critchfield, the CIA head of the Eastern European and Near East divisions about his theory.\n\nAs he later pointed out:\n\n\"I reviewed Angleton's entire career, going back through his relationships with Philby, his adherence to all of Golitsyn's wild theories, his false accusations against foreign services and the resulting damage to the liaison relationships, and finally his accusation against innocent Soviet Division officers.\"\n\nAs a result of his investigation, Petty concluded that there was an \"80-85 percent probability\" that Angleton was a Soviet mole.\n\nPetty decided not to tell his boss, Jean M. Evans, about his investigation. \"Petty worked in absolute secrecy, ... he was gathering information to accuse his own boss, James Angleton, as a Soviet spy.\n\nBy the spring of 1973, after toiling for some two years, Petty felt he could not develop his theory any further. He decided to retire.\"\n\nClare Edward Petty died in April, 2011.\n\nMr. Petty joined the fledgling CIA in 1947. Within a few years, he played a key role in identifying and catching Heinz Felfe, one of the most successful Soviet agents of the Cold War.\n\nDouglas Valentine (Author):\n\nValentine's research into CIA activities began when CIA Director William Colby gave him free access to interview CIA officials who had been involved in various aspects of the Phoenix program in South Vietnam. Angleton was key to understanding the CIA. Weiner hasn't detailed Angleton's relationship with the underworld through the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. ...\n\n\"Through Angleton's relationships with Italian royalty, Tibor Rosenbaum [Mossad agent], Charlie Siragusa [FBN agent], Hank Manfredi [FBN], and Mario Brod, he was certainly aware of Meyer Lansky's central role as the Mafia's banker in the Caribbean - where Lansky's mob associate from Las Vegas, Moe Dalitz, opened an account at Castle Bank - as well as in Mexico, where Angleton's friend, Winston M. Scott, was station chief, and certainly kept tabs on Lansky's associate, former Mexican president Miguel Aleman. As ever, Angleton and Lansky were the dark stars of the intelligence and financial aspects of international drug smuggling. Alan Block devotes some pages to this in his book, Masters of Paradise. ...\n\nAngleton thought William Colby might be a mole.\n\nAngleton exposed the divisions within the CIA after 1966, the Colby vs. Helms factions. He also represented the literary sensibility the CIA once had, where finding secrets was like teasing the meaning out of a poem. Now we have sledgehammer spies. ... Cord Meyer worked with Angleton and used people like labor leader Irving Brown and Jay Lovestone to travel around Europe in the early 1950s. Despite all the strum and drang about battling the Soviet Union, what the CIA was really trying to do was court Socialists away from Communists to form Social Democracy governments to counter the influence of the Soviet Union. Eventually that strategy worked. That was really what was going on behind the scenes.\n\n... Angleton ran the CIA's narcotics operation, in league with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, until 1971, when Helms put it under Tom Karamessines at operations; Karamessines was the former CIA Athens chief. I know for a fact that Angleton in the counterintelligence division of the CIA was in charge of its relations with law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, which is one of the reasons organizationally that he ended up having relations with people like Charlie Siragusa, a high ranking official in the FBN. This is how Angleton enters into relationships with Corsican drug traffickers ...\n\nSuzan Mazur: Speaking of affairs, Weiner's mention of Cord Meyer on the show had to do with Meyer's ex-wife (no name), who was one of JFK's lovers, being mysteriously murdered and Angleton turning up at her house to see if there was a diary. But as you illuminate in Strength of the Wolf, Mary Pinchot Meyer took LSD given to her by Timothy Leary and also distributed it to the Washington Establishment, possibly to JFK as well. ... You also say that Joseph Civello ran the heroin business in Dallas with John Ormento and the Magaddino family in Buffalo and that they were linked to Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, Jr. and Jimmy Hoffa ... Jackie Kennedy in a kind of premonition of Dallas wrote in one of her letters to Clark Clifford that she was concerned about the 50 businessmen in Texas who said: 'Why should we do anything to help the Kennedys?'\n\n... Valentine: First of all, I don't pretend to know who killed Kennedy. For all I know it could have been Lee Harvey Oswald. That chapter on JFK in my book is speculative...\n\nJack Ruby went to Dallas in 1948 working for White and actually infiltrated Bugsy Siegel's Mafia drug connection with the Kuomintang in Mexico. As far as I know nobody was ever arrested. Bugsy Siegel was killed because he was getting a little out of control...\".\n\nJames Angleton's supporters:\n\nFrank Gardiner Wisner (1909 - 1965)\n\nwas head of Office of Strategic Services operations in southeastern Europe in 1944-1945.\n\nHe served as the 2nd Deputy Director of Plans in charge of the Directorate of Plans of the Central Intelligence Agency from August 23, 1951 to January 1, 1959.\n\nHe was also tapped for the Seven Society.

A friend of Friedmann's in London, Edith Tudor Hart, a Soviet agent, \"...first approached Philby about the possibility of working for Soviet intelligence\" in 1934. Litzi Friedmann was \"almost certainly the person who recruited him to the Soviet cause.\" Theodore Maly / Man, Hungarian, and Anatoly Gorsky / Kap, of the OGPU in London, a German known as Reif / Mar, also co-operated with Philby. In February 1937, Philby came to Seville, Spain, but in 1938, Walter Krivitsky / Samuel Ginsberg, a former GRU officer in Paris, published an account of two Soviet intelligence agents had penetrated the British Foreign Office and a third Soviet intelligence agent had worked as a journalist for a British newspaper during the civil war in Spain.\n\nHester Marsden-Smedley introduced Kim Philby to Marjorie Maxse of the War Office.\n\nPhilby was appointed as an instructor of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in 1940 - in the Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6, the British intelligence service - with the support of his then influential father, who had sponsored him at MI6 Major General Stewart Menzies.\n\nIvan Chichayev / Vadim, re-established contact with Kim Philby.\n\nKim Philby met James Jesus Angleton, a US counter-intelligence officer working with SIS in London, Section V.\n\nAngleton \"...became suspicious of Philby when he failed to pass on information relating to a British agent executed by the Gestapo in Germany.

It was the start of a long friendship:\n\n\"Once I met Philby, the world of intelligence that had once interested me consumed me. He had taken on the Nazis and Fascists head-on and penetrated their operations in Spain and Germany. His sophistication and experience appealed to us ... Kim taught me a great deal.\"\n\nPhillip Knightley, the author of Philby: KGB Masterspy (1988), has pointed out:\n\n\"Philby was one of Angleton's instructors, his prime tutor in counter-intelligence; Angleton came to look upon him as an elder-brother figure.\"\n\nAngleton impressed his senior officers and within six months he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant and was appointed as chief of the Italian Desk for the European Theater of Operations. A colleague, John Raymond Baine, later remembered him as a well-respected officer...\".\n\nIn September 1949, Philby arrived in the United States, as First Secretary to the British Embassy and as chief British intelligence representative in Washington. 1952, Philby was working as a journalist, in 1954 a diplomatic newsletter.\n\nIn October 1955, Philby was officially cleared by Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan.\n\n\"...On the evening of 23rd January 1963, Kim Philby vanished from Beirut, ...\" either on board a ship or escaped through Syria, to Soviet Armenia.\n\nOn 1 July 1963, Philby's flight to Moscow was officially confirmed.\n\nBaliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski point out the opportunity the Soviets had at Gibraltar. \"...

In his journal, under the date of January 8, 1950, Heinrich Muller noted the conversation he had with Philby regarding what happened on Gibraltar on July 4, 1943. ... In Philby's opinion, Stalin wanted General Sikorski's death.\n\nAs the chief of the British counterespionage for the Iberian Peninsula, Philby could easily find out the date of Sikorski's visit to Gibraltar on his way from the Near East to London. In his version of events, the Soviets arranged for Maisky, their ambassador to London, to fly back via Gibraltar, and to be there at the same time as General Sikorski. Philby believed that Sikorski was dangerous for Stalin. He told the former chief of the Gestapo that Maisky's passenger list included two professional assassins.\n\nAs Muller recalls, the British, except for Philby's treasonable activities, had no direct connection with the murder of Sikorski.\n\nAccording to Philby, Churchill had been tipped off that this would happen, but he was so frightened about the possible rupture with Stalin over the death of Polish officers that he said nothing by way of warning.\n\n... On March 31, 1941, in a conversation with the Czechoslovakian legate to the Soviet Union, Zdenek Fierlinger, Maisky stated that he can guarantee that General Sikorski will never enter Warsaw again...\" - by Jozef Kazimierz Kubit with translation by Kasia Miszta.\n\nCopyright by telegraph.co.uk:\n\nStalin's accusers claim that Gen Sikorski's plane was left unguarded on the runway at Gibraltar, and could easily have been sabotaged. They also point out that on the day of the crash, July 4, 1943, a plane carrying the Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky and a small retinue of Soviet troops parked next to the doomed Polish leader's aircraft. Allegations of a plot by the Soviet Union, determined not to let Polish nationalism get in the way of communist expansion after the war, have been further fuelled by the presence on Gibraltar of Kim Philby - he was in charge of British intelligence operations in the territory from 1941 to 1944. ...\n\nClaims that a Polish government office in London received a telephone warning of Sikorski's death in Gibraltar weeks before it happened, the fact that the British spy Kim Philby had been in Gibraltar, and the lack of bodies have all fuelled conspiracy theories.\n\nKim Philby prior to that functioned as instructor specializing in sabotage behind enemy lines [an instructor with the Special Operations Executive in 1940]; then he was the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944.\n\nCopyright on October 27, 2017 by Carl Schreck, a senior correspondent for RFE/RL.:\n\n\"... The declassified document - dated November 23, 1963 - states that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald was at the Soviet Embassy on September 28, 1963 [and \"...the American had been there the previous day\" ?!].\n\n... The CIA document states that Oswald called the Soviet Embassy on October 1, 1963, \"identifying himself by name and speaking broken Russian, stating\" that he'd spoken to Kostikov \"and asking the guard who answered the phone whether there was 'anything new concerning the telegram to Washington'.\" ...\n\nthe links between Kostikov, who was serving as vice consul at the embassy as Oswald tried in vain to get a Soviet visa there in September 1963, and the KGB's \"assassination\" department appear to be far from definitively established, according to previously classified documents now available to the public.\n\n... Valery Kostikov, was identified by the CIA [on November 23rd, 1963] a day after Kennedy's assassination [in Dallas on November 22, 1963] as a KGB officer in an operation allegedly being run by the Soviet spy agency's 13th Department \"responsible for sabotage and assassination.\"\n\n... Oswald's contacts with Kostikov were previously known [before 2017]\n\n... But their interactions at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City nonetheless grabbed headlines in both Russian and Western media following the October 26 [2017], release of nearly 3,000 records on Kennedy's killing.\n\n... memo to the CIA's director in September 1964, FBI head J. Edgar Hoover said his agency's files \"do not contain any information to fully support\" the CIA's assessment that Kostikov worked for the KGB's 13th Department.\n\n... Hoover's memo also cited a letter the FBI received from the CIA's counterintelligence chief [J. ANGLETON] five months before Kennedy's killing stating that the CIA \"could locate no information in your files to indicate Kostikov was a representative\" of the KGB's assassinations department.\n\n... The CIA said in early 1964 that Oswald's contact with Kostikov and other KGB officers stationed under diplomatic cover in Mexico City \"was nothing more than a grim coincidence.\" ...\n\n[Valery Vladimirovich Kostikov was born in 1933, died in 2002, served in Spain, Mexico and Cuba; and again in Mexico City in the Soviet Embassy]. ...\n\nKostikov's appearance matched the description an \"FBI-controlled double agent\" gave of a Soviet intelligence officer he met in Mexico, the CIA memo says. That agent's Soviet handler in the United States was Oleg Brykin of the KGB's 13th Department, according to the CIA background memo.\n\n... October 26, 2017, Litman states that Kostikov was a captain in the KGB's 13th Department, which was responsible for assassinations, calling the Soviet officer a \"trained 'neutralizer'.\" ...\".\n\nNews on October 28, 2017:\n\n1. FBI informant claimed Dallas police officer was real assassin;\n\nAccording to an April 1964 note, an informant claimed to the FBI that slain Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit was the real gunman behind Kennedy's assassination. The informant also told the FBI that a week before the assassination, Tippit met with a third party - possibly gunman Lee Harvey Oswald - at Jack Ruby's nightclub.\n\nJFK files have revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald and his killer Jack Ruby / Jacob Rubenstein met in the weeks before Kennedy was assassinated. The pair were seen together at Florida's Key West airport in 1963\n\nand were overheard speaking in code about 'Big Bird', according to the documents of the airport manager George Faraldo. Oswald and nightclub owner Ruby were apparently both part of a large group of 'mostly young' people heading to Cuba. Mr Faraldo told the FBI that Ruby and Oswald were dressed casually in a sport shirts and trousers. The airport manager added that Ruby 'spent most of the time not mingling with the group but standing against the doorway that led from the waiting area to the rear plane boarding area'.\n\n2. Hoover said the public must believe Oswald acted alone:\n\n'The thing I am concerned about, and so is [Deputy Attorney General Nicholas] Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin', Hoover wrote in a November 1963 memo.\n\n3. Oswald spoke to a KGB agent in the department responsible for assassinations:\n\nA memo from Nov. 23, 1963, reveals that Oswald secretly met with Russian spies at the Soviet Embassy in MEXICO CITY, less than two months before the assassination.\n\nHe met with Valeriy Kostikov, a KGB agent the FBI said worked for the agency's 13th Department, which was 'responsible for sabotage and assassination', on Sept 28, 1963.\n\nBelow Jefferson Morley on the new JFK files wrote down on 04 November 2017:\n\n\"... The document, a CIA cable dated October 8, 1963, has been partially released before but the slugline of the cable, LCIMPROVE, has now been declassified. ... According to previously released JFK files, LCIMPROVE was the agency's code name for 'counter-espionage involving Soviet intelligence services worldwide'. That was the undisputed domain of counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton, the subject of my new book. ...\n\nThe October 8, 1963, cable, written by Mexico City station chief Winston Scott, concerned contacts between an American named Lee Oswald and a Soviet consular official named Valery Kostikov. The LCIMPROVE slugline is strong evidence that Angleton was notified about Oswald's contact with Kostikov, a presumed KGB officer. Scott and Angleton had been friends since World War II. A JFK file released last week showed that some CIA officials suspected Kostikov might work for KGB's 13th Department, which was reputedly responsible for political assassinations. ... The story of Oswald's contact with Kostikov is not new.\n\nThe Mary Ferrell Foundation has a good primer on Kostikov. ... Jim Angleton and Win Scott, CIA friends...\n\nOswald returned to Texas after his visit to Mexico City. As I recently reported for the Daily Beast,\n\na senior FBI agent reported Oswald's return to the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Angleton's office on November 15, 1963.\n\nThe Daily Beast story showed that Angleton knew, or should have known, Oswald was in Dallas. Now we know that Angleton also knew Oswald had been in contact with a KGB officer who some said was a KGB assassin. After receiving the October 8 cable, Angleton could have asked the FBI to locate and interview Oswald to explain his contacts with Kostikov. The FBI located him but Angleton is not known to have taken any action. Seven day later, President Kennedy was dead, allegedly shot dead by Oswald. ... In 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations re-opened the investigation of JFK's death. As the HSCA investigators began to review CIA records, they asked the agency to supply a list of codenames found in the documents. One of the code names they asked for was LCIMPROVE. In the CIA's response, the agency gave the definition. ...\".\n\n4. According to an FBI memo on the Soviet reaction to Kennedy?s death, Soviet spies believed President Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the assassination plot.\n\n5.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 26, 1963, memo from CIA Deputy Director James Angelton, the British newspaper the Cambridge News received a tip that a reporter 'should call the American Embassy in London for some big news, and then hung up'. According to Britain's MI5 intelligence service, the newspaper received the call 25 minutes before Kennedy was killed.\n\nThe reporter, who MI5 noted was 'sound and loyal', said he'd never received a call of that kind before.\n\nAnna Savva, a reporter at the News, told the Associated Press the paper has no record of the tip being taken.\n\nAbove acc. to 'philly.com'."
