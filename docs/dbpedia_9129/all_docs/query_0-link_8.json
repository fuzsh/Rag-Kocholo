        "text": "Citation preview\n\nFORGING A UNITARY STATE Russia’s Management of the Eurasian Space, 1650–1850\n\nCovering two centuries of Russian history, Forging a Unitary State provides a comprehensive account of the creation of what is commonly known as the “Russian Empire,” stretching from Poland to Siberia. In this book, John P. LeDonne demonstrates that the so-called Empire was, for the most part, a unitary state, defined by an obsessive emphasis on centralization and uniformity. The standardization of local administration, the judicial system, the tax regime, and commercial policy was carried out slowly but systematically over eight generations, in the hope of integrating people on the periphery into the Russian political and social hierarchy. The ultimate goal of Russian policy was to create a “Fortress Empire” consisting of a huge Russian unitary state flanked by a few peripheral territories, such as Finland, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia. Additional peripheral states like Sweden, Turkey, and Persia would guarantee the security of this “Fortress Empire” and the management of Eurasian territory. LeDonne’s provocative argument is supported by a careful comparative study of Russian expansion along Russia’s western, southern, and eastern borders, drawing on vital but under-studied administrative evidence. Forging a Unitary State is an essential resource for those interested in the long history of Russian expansionism. JOHN P. LEDONNE is a senior research associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, Harvard University.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nJOHN P.

Two of them left a mark on me as early as high school. One taught me to structure my writing in order to shape a large amount of material into a convincing story; the other insisted that one could not study history without the help of geography. Later in life, there was Marc Raeff at Columbia, who guided my first steps in the study of Russian administrative history after I completed my dissertation on the formation of economic regions after the Revolution. Later still, Edward Keenan brought me to Harvard, and at numerous lunches challenged some of my conclusions with his usual inquisitive open-mindedness. These four scholars are no longer with us, but I owe them what I later became. More recently, Serhii Plokhy supported a beginner’s work in Ukrainian history and recommended the manuscript to University of Toronto Press. I also owe a great deal to Mikhail Dolbilov’s profound knowledge of the Western Borderlands; to Erika Monahan, who taught me the difference between winter and spring wheat and many other things about Russian trade along the Irtysh River; and to Willard Sunderland, who introduced me to the vast grasslands of Siberia. My special thanks also go out to Paul Bushkovitch, who was the first to read the entire manuscript and gave it an early push; to Richard Wortman, with whom I have been exchanging books and ideas for some forty years; and to Donald Ostrowski for sharing many discussions in happier times. I am most grateful for the publication grants and support I have received from both the Davis Center and the Ukrainian Institute and their directors, Rawi Abdelal and Serhii Plokhy, as well as from Executive Director Alexandra Vacroux and the ever busy but always hopeful Maria Altamore. At the Press, Richard Ratzlaff was the first to welcome the manuscript, and his successor Stephen Shapiro piloted it with ruthless determination across all the pitfalls of the acceptance process. I am also grateful to the Academic Committee who gave its final approval. Many thanks are also due to the redoubtable but generous copy\n\nxvi Acknowledgments\n\neditor Judith Williams and to Robin Studniberg, who gently but firmly kept reminding me that there were deadlines to meet. Since I am allergic to computers, I was fortunate to find two outstanding graduate students to digitize the manuscript. Michael Smeltzer digitized a first version, and the very professional Sara Powell digitized the last version and the maps. There are also those who helped in a more personal way. I am deeply grateful to Lubomyr Hajda and Tamara Nary for their friendship and their help; to Mary Louise Corradino, who offered her time and generous support in times of great distress; to Yun Ji (Gigi), Sylvie Papazian, and Robin Yun for creating a cordial working environment, and last but not least, Penelope Skalnik, a genius with the computer and a wonderful friend.

For non-Cyrillic languages, both in the text and bibliographies, the full spelling with diacritical marks is preserved for both personal names and for toponyms/hydronyms. For Cyrillic languages in the text and notes, the simplified/modified Library of Congress Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarussian transliteration systems have been used for both personal names and toponyms/hydronyms. This system a) omits the (‘, “) primes used to transliterate the soft and hard signs (ь,ъ); b) masculine family name endings in ий (Russian/BR: іі, Ukrainian: yi) are contracted to “y” (thus Viazemsky, not Viazemskii, Khmelnytsky, not Khmel’nyts’kyi); and c) in initial positions, Ya, Yu, Ye, (for я, ю, є) are preferred to Ia, Iu, Ie (Yavorsky, Yakovlev, Yalta). For Cyrillic languages in the bibliography and bibliographic citations, the full Library of Congress transliteration system is preserved (with the exception of the above noted initial “Y” in personal names and toponyms). For toponyms and hydronyms on all territories under consideration, I have used current place and river names (followed, when first used, by the alternate historical form/s in parentheses), unless listing the historical term first made more sense. Hence, Lviv (Lwów, Lvov, Lemberg), Chernihiv (Chernigov), Hadiach (Gadiach), Myrhorod (Mirgorod), Vilnius (Vilna), but Elizavetograd (Kirovohrad, Kropyvnytsky), Ekaterinoslav (Dnipropetrovsk, Dnipro), Yurburg (Jubarkas). We have also retained a few more commonly used anglicized forms, such as Belorussia (Belarus), Kiev (Kyiv), Volhynia (Volyn), Podolia (Podilia), Polesia (Polissia), Dnieper (Dnipro), Dniester (Dnister), Odessa (Odesa). For a work of this size, the density of biographical and topographical positions in the text would ideally require an appendix. We hope, therefore, that the readers will be satisfied with the author’s choice of the key positions listed in the index.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nFORGING A UNITARY STATE\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nI offer this work as a sequel to my Absolutism and Ruling Class, published in 1990, where I discussed the public administration of what was still called “Russia” – the central provinces between the Urals and the western borderlands – from 1700 to 1825. It was my intention at the time to continue with another book to discuss the management of the borderlands, but the task proved harder than I expected. Ultimately, I decided to expand the time frame to include a longer period, from the mid-seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. One can certainly argue about when the construction of a Russian “Empire” began – during the reign of Ivan III (1462–1505), or that of Ivan IV the Terrible ­(1547–84) – but it was the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich (1645–76) that marks the beginning of sustained drive of territorial expansion that would continue with only some short interruptions until the First World War, if not even 1950. The year 1650 is of course arbitrary, but also symbolic of a first period of Russian expansion until 1800. The year 1850 marks the zenith of a second period, that of the maximization of Russian power under Nicholas I (1825–55) and the completion of a structure of territorial administration began by Alexei Mikhailovich and his son Peter I (1689–1725), and the culmination of a unitary state. After the death of Nicholas I, a third period began, lasting until the First World War and characterized by the gradual loss of legitimacy by the Romanov house and the rise of nationalism among ethnic groups of what had by then become a Russian Empire. This work focuses on the first and second periods because they are the constructive ones, and also because the enormous volume of available materials makes it impossible for a single scholar to make a detailed analysis of the increasingly complex administration of such an enormous land mass. I propose to discuss a number of topics largely ignored in most of our scholarship on the Russian Empire – focused as it is on ethnic identities, social tensions, and intellectual issues – and draw attention to what can be broadly called the history of its public administration. I mean here more specifically the policy\n\n4\n\nForging a Unitary State\n\nof harmonization and integration, aimed at imposing a uniform system of local administration, judicial procedures, tax administration, and even social and religious integration. That policy, I argue, aimed at creating not an empire, but a unitary state across the vast expanse of Eurasia, of which Russia was the indisputable core. First of all, however, I need to definite the term “Eurasia.” “Eurasia” has become fashionable, but few scholars take the risk of defining its borders, especially in the West. It is sometimes misunderstood as a single continent combining Europe and Asia as if they belonged together. I do not hesitate to say that I remain a disciple of Sir Halford Mackinder, Geoffrey Parker, and Owen Lattimore. Eurasia is indeed a huge land mass, but one only partaking of both Europe and Asia. Its core consists of what is usually called “European Russia.” Its western border follows the Scandinavian Alps separating Sweden from Norway; the Oder, the old boundary of the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary along the Morava, on the Dinaric Alps. The southern border follows the Taurus Mountains of Turkey and the Zagros of Persia; the eastern border is marked by the Hindu Kush, the Gobi Desert, and the costal ranges along the Sea of Okhotsk; the core is bounded in the west by Sweden and Poland, in the south by Turkey and Persia, in the east by Mongolia. Eurasia is thus nearly identical with Mackinder’s Heartland.1 But these territories are of two kinds. Sweden, Poland, Turkey, and Persia I call core powers, and the lands between them and the Russian core I call frontiers. These frontiers, forming an “overlapping space” (Überlappungsraum), are shaped by four river basins draining into four seas – the Baltic, Black, Caspian, and Okhosk seas. Their geography makes them into zones of contention between opposing core powers that invited Russia’s advance. These border regions I group into three theatres of Russian strategic activity: the western (the Baltic basin); the southern (the Black and Caspian basins); and the eastern (mainly Siberia and the basin of the Amur draining into the sea of Japan). I distinguish three states in the period under consideration: the creation of a unitary state in the Russian core; the integration of the frontiers into a single homogenous system; and the attempt to transform the outlying core powers into a glacis protecting the security of the imperial system, which I have called Fortress Russia, later a Fortress Empire. I discussed these stages in my Russia and the World. The expansion of the Russian core and the integration of the frontiers form the object of this work. My definition of Eurasia raises the question of the extent to which Russia was, and is, part of Europe. Like a definition of Eurasia and of the location of its orders, the question is worth asking, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. It is now taken for granted by most that Russia is indeed part of Europe, but it is my contention that it is not: it is the core of Eurasia. Carsten Goehrke, in his original and very valuable interpretation of Russian history, writes that Russia developed “the consciousness of an historical identity [Besonderheit]\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nbetween East and West resting above all upon a European but also upon an Asiatic foundation.”2 Some of the fundamental features of its political culture have exercised, and will continue to exercise, a strong impact upon its relations with its immediate peripheries. Byzantium, which did not emerge all naked from the sea like Botticelli’s Venus, belonged to the Hellenistic tradition of the East, to Eastern Christendom; Europe to Latin Christendom, shaped by Roman and Germanic influences, as Nikolai Danilevsky contended in his famous book.3 The division between Russia and Europe ran along the great and permanent fault line between the two branches of Christendom, in fact of the ancient world, between the Hellenistic and Roman worlds.4 What Galina Yemelianova calls the grassroots of the Gingissid trend of Russian historical development deserves greater attention: the story of Muscovy and the Turkic peoples, its major interlocutors for 250 years in the immense space between the Carpathians and the Volga. Similarly, Istvan Vasary is convinced that the “Turco-Mongol overlords had fundamental influence on the nascence and fate of the Russian state.”5 The obsession with Byzantium has blotted out additional influences from Armenia and Georgia, as well as Persia. But what does it mean in practical terms? Yemelianova, once again, writes that the Gengissid trend “was intertwined with the official byzantinization of the Russian state [and] that the interplay of these two cultural influences contributed to the sacerdotal make up of the tsar’s authority, the fusion of the secular and religious domains, and the ruler’s supremacy over the law.”6 The political geography of Eastern Orthodoxy shows that, in the Russian experience at least, the head of the Church nearly always resided in the political capital, and that, despite the proclaimed “symphony” between the two powers, the ecclesiastical power would inevitably fall under the control of the secular power – as happened in the seventeenth century. It means that the resulting sacralization raised the person of the monarch above all others on earth and made him unchallengeable on pain of losing all hope of salvation after death. It meant that, in sharp contrast with the Latin tradition in Europe, men could have no dual loyalty – to God and to Caesar – justifying challenge and rebellion. There could be no contest, no fruitful dialectic between Church and State, one of the defining markers of European civilization. No grand prince or tsar ever went to Canossa. Nor was he bound by his word, and here he was much like his Turkic interlocutors among the khans of the steppe, who looked upon treaties as personal arrangements without binding conditions. It follows that there could be no contract between the ruler and his subjects, and this for another reason. Despite brave attempts by Soviet scholarship to claim it for three generations, Russia did not experience feudalism and subinfeudation. Feudalism rested on a contractual relationship defining both rights and obligations between higher and lower lords, between suzerain and subject.\n\n6\n\nForging a Unitary State\n\nThe tsar-emperor (or his representative) did not take an oath before his subjects, as the Polish kings had done in the past. In 1654, when Vasilii Buturlin took the oath of allegiance from Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, he refused to take a reciprocal oath on behalf of the tsar: representatives from the other side were not true sovereigns and, if they were at times of another faith, in effect they were aliens. Likewise, when the Duchy of Kurland was incorporated into the expanding Russian core nearly 150 years later (1795), its Protestant nobles submitted a list of charters and privileges granted by the Polish king, the feudal suzerain of Kurland, but did not ask for their confirmation: they merely placed themselves “at Her Majesty’s mercy.”7 Moreover, Muscovy’s Sonderweg far from the open seas did not generate the gradual development of triangular structures between sovereign, town, and landed elites, the fertile ground for the creation of a public space and a sociopolitical dynamic conducive to the growth of democratic values. When, with the development of a money economy, serfdom was ebbing away in Europe, it spread from Poland on the edge of Eurasia into Russia to degrade even further the condition of the peasantry, deepening the chasm between Russia and Europe. Both continued to belong to two different civilizations, destined by an unchanging geopolitical situation to remain in a semi-permanent state of mutual hostility. On the other hand, the issue of Russia’s relations with Europe is linked with that of the country’s role as a modernizing force. Those who insist on Russia being part of Europe cannot shy away from their assumption that it was an “inferior” part of Europe, in matters of government (autocracy), police administration (corruption), and economy (serfdom). European apologists see the incorporation of the borderlands, especially the western ones, as a step backwards in the course of their development until then shaped by Poland and Sweden, even Persia. But if Russia is seen not within Europe but as the core of Eurasia, it can also be characterized as a modernizing force. Indeed, anyone reading documents of the period soon becomes aware that some of the borderlands needed “modernization” not so much from Europe as from the expanding Russian core. We discover, for example, that the Baltic provinces had no common system of weights and measures, that units varied not only from one district to another but even from one manor to another, a medieval situation that drove to distraction the officials of the Provision Chancery in Petersburg when it came to assessing the deliveries of grain to the capital and the army; that there existed seventeen separate taxes on trade in the small Sheki khanate of Transcaucasia alone, enough to paralyse commercial exchanges in the region; that the nomads, whose only source of wealth was in cattle, did not cultivate hay, which alone could save their animals against devastating frosts that killed most of them in winter; that the Cossacks in western Georgia had to teach the locals how to improve their diet (and their revenues) by fishing; and what are we\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nto make of those “privileges” and local laws which so enthuse the supporters of the “differences,” and which the Russian government supposedly encouraged? The Magdeburg Law in effect in the western provinces was adapted from the Sachsenspiegel of 1242; the third Lithuanian Statute of 1588, drawn up by and for the nobility, had largely become anachronistic by 1800, while the Russian Ulozhenie of 1649 (which the Statute influenced) had been amended by so much legislation as to become unrecognizable. Russian penal legislation was not much crueller than some borderland legislation,8 and indeed the cruellest punishment in the Russian army – running the gauntlet – was a Swedish import. In a word, those famous “differences” were in fact remnants of a past designed to protect the status of Polish and German nobilities. That explains why the Russians met such resistance in trying to eradicate them in pursuit of “standardization.” To champion a “Russian Empire of differences” contains the danger of supporting anachronistic backwardness.9 In the process of incorporating the peripheries, local laws and privileges were recognized only in so far as they did not deviate from the existing laws of the “empire,” but the laws were made by the monarch independently of any constitutional restraints, and it was he who determined when the divergence was becoming unacceptable. That was the case in the Baltic provinces, but in Lithuania, on the other hand, they were not recognized, then were recognized, and finally abolished. In other words, all local privileges were seen as residual – whatever Moscow–St Petersburg chose not to take upon itself. That is why one cannot claim that the government ever violated its promises: they depended from the beginning on the supra-legal will of the ruler. Alexander II (1855–81) went even farther with his decisive “No one can take upon himself to petition me about the general welfare and needs of the state.”10 There was in that statement the germ of the perception of a homogenous state. Jane Burbank may have been too forceful when she claimed there were no natural rights11 – unless she meant in the Russian core alone, where the concept of natural law was always an oxymoron – but that perception also reflected an assertive policy towards the creation of unitary state. An interesting illustration is the treatment of the monarch’s title. In 1785, for instance, the title included some thirty-seven possessions of Catherine II, including “All the Russias,” and “others.” There were sixteen “Russian” territories, four Tatar and Siberian, three Baltic and three Ukrainian, three Belorussian, and two Caucasian, all mixed together, not in accordance with their location or date of incorporation.12 The 1817 title included Poland as a tsarstvo (tsardom, not kingdom) placed between Astrakhan and Sibir’ (Siberian) among the five tsarstva (Kazan, Astrakhan, Poland, Siberian, and Tavrich). What can better explain this Russian perception of fluid homogeneity in a unitary state as a realm forming a whole (tselost’), as Richard Wortman calls it, “in which the boundaries between the metropolis and the peripheries tended to blur”?13\n\n8\n\nForging a Unitary State\n\nIf the prevailing understanding of law assumed that differences were not accepted a priori but tolerated as a temporary aberration on the way to the creation of a unitary state, what then is a unitary state? It is one in which the government creates its territorial divisions, determines their number and boundaries, their authority and the scope of their operations; it also leaves them very little decision-making power. It seeks to minimize centrifugal forces, and downgrades the importance of the regional capitals, whose locations and historical importance may rival its own. Within those tightly circumscribed jurisdictions, a highly centralized government pursues a policy of harmonization and integration of the administration of justice, of tax collection, of economic management, and even, if possible, of religious unification. During the period under study here, the Russian government pursued such a policy gradually but systematically, although hampered by enormous distances, low population density, and shortages of personnel in the counties and provinces.14 From the days of Peter I, this policy of harmonization and integration intensified to reach the first peak during the reign of Catherine II (1762–96) and a second during that of Nicholas I (1825–55). It was immensely encouraged by the creation of ministries in 1802–11, which followed that of a hierarchical and integrated fiscal structure of tax collection by Catherine’s great Procurator General Prince Alexander Viazemsky (1727–93) in the 1780s.15 Ministries, being functional rather than territorial organizations, have a powerful interest in monopolizing the management of their specific functions and their related activities throughout the entire territory. Provincial agencies were subordinated to them alone, and ministries destroyed the regional and local bodies capable of challenging the uniform operation of their own agencies.16 In the 1850s we witness the completion of the ministerial system and the apogee of the unitary state. A similar development had been taking place in France, with the pre-revolutionary intendants and the Napoleonic ministers and prefects also imbued with a military spirit and an obsession with uniformity. In Russia, as in Napoleonic France, there existed a powerful incentive to create a unitary state. Maritime powers in search of luxury goods and raw materials built commodity chains resting on traditional trade networks going back to antiquity; they built decentralized empires consisting of production and trade hubs supported by naval stations. Russia, on the other hand, hemmed in by almost internal seas cut off by nature (harsh weather, narrow straits) or geopolitical factors from the same great oceans, as well as hampered by endemic shortages of capital and labour, needed to create a continental market, and a centralized management of scarce resources on a continental scale to guarantee the often insecure functioning of a military-industrial complex: it had to be capable of sustaining an expansive policy designed to unify Eurasia under Russian leadership. Hence the importance of finance and war ministries in the management of the space occupied by the expanding core. Russia already understood the importance of an alliance between geopolitics and economic\n\nIntroduction 9\n\npower because it was so aware of the latter’s weakness; to remedy it required a polity to enforce centralization and homogeneity in a unitary state. A unitary state must not be confused with a nation state. A nation state is one in which political parties and interest groups converge to share in the political process and the elaboration of national policies. It is a state in which civil society has become strong enough to impose its views on the administrative state. The Russian unitary state could never make the transition to nation state because of the divisive influence of emerging ethnic centrifugal forces. What we call the formation of the Russian Empire was in fact a process of administrative, unitary state building from the Baltic to the Sea of Okhotsk, from the White to the Black seas. Beginning in the 1860s, however, the emerging liberal, conservative, and multi-ethnic movements acted together to undermine the administrative state, but could not create a nation state. The result was a political vacuum incapable of coping with the stresses of economic and social dislocation. A unitary state must not be confused with an empire either. It is a world in itself, while an empire is a constellation of worlds revolving around that of the unitary state in the making. Was Russia then an empire or a unitary state? It was both, but at a different time. The Russian Empire was one in which the Russian core built a unitary state until it encountered unsurmountable resistance and went on constructing an empire. The incorporation of Finland, Poland, and Transcaucasia – and later Central Asia – was by necessity a type of imperial construction because these territories represented different worlds, a constellation of contiguous territories revolving around an expanding world reaching, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the natural limits of its expansion. The expanding core sought to become largely Orthodox and Russian, a unitary confessional state and a unitary Russian society, despite the inevitable exceptions that only confirm the rule. Finland, Poland, and Transcaucasia could not possibly be integrated into the expanding core and unitary state, but the traditions of the unitary state remained so strong that the Russians persisted in seeking to integrate them while recognizing they could not (as in Poland). This dilemma would become the fundamental flaw of the Russian Empire during the last fifty years of its existence. In other words, I do not understand the words “Russian Empire” in the usual sense, but as a process begun with the systematic construction of a unitary state followed by that of an empire. I also claim that the Russians were aware of the strategic limit of their expansion. I have discussed this in The Russian Empire and the World and The Grand Strategy of the Russian Empire. Russian policy exhibited a form of “aggressive defensiveness,” perhaps unique in its kind. Spain, England, and France did not expand over long distances in order to protect the security of their homeland, but Russia did, and conceived the outer limits of its expansion to be those of Eurasia as I defined it here. As a result, we can postulate the existence of three consecutive zones of Russian activity in the three theatres: the core as a unitary\n\n10\n\nForging a Unitary State\n\nstate; the building of an empire in a first periphery; and an outer periphery encompassing Sweden, Poland, Prussia, Turkey, and Persia as satellites of the Russian empire. Thus did Russia manage the Eurasian space. After defining Eurasia, examining the position of the ruler in the system, and claiming that Russia was building a unitary state until the beginning of the nineteenth century, there remains to examine yet another process, that of social integration and the governing of the unitary state. I submit that the unitary state – the expanding core, as I call it throughout this work – was kept together not so much by a bureaucracy as by an interlocking mesh of patronage networks, combining to form a gigantic pyramid of which the tsar-emperor was the Grand Patron. Patronage networks are hierarchical rather than ideological formations, created for the purpose of sharing the spoils of office. An individual of some importance attracts a retinue of favourseeking “creatures” who enhance his prestige. He, himself, seeks to integrate into a wider network, in which the original patron becomes the creature of a more powerful individual. And on to the top of the political hierarchy, where the last patron becomes the immediate client of the Grand Patron.17 In Russia’s relations with its peripheries within the emerging unitary state, the existence of patronage networks implied the integration of local elites into the power structure of the Russian core. The process is usually called one of cooptation. I prefer to use “superstratification,” a term coined by Sinologist Wolfram Eberhard in his studies of medieval China.18 I believe it is more appropriate in a study of Russian expansion. Cooptation implies a certain equality between parties: it is mainly a process of horizontal integration. A Polish magnate of Right Bank Ukraine becomes Russia’s foreign minister or curator of a university and director of an educational region. A Baltic aristocratic German enters the Russian army alongside Russians and becomes a general, a grade giving access, as I see it, to the ruling elite. But superstratification implies something else, and especially so in the eastern theatre. As Russia expanded, it incorporated nomads and hunters who were more often than not descendants of the Turkic interlocutors of Muscovite Russia, as in the former khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Sibir’, and others beyond the Yenisei river. These societies were undergoing a process of stratification in the seventeenth century, and a top stratum was crystallizing, claiming to become the unchallengeable ruling group of its people. Here Russians were intruders, armed with superior weapons, convinced of the superiority of the settler over the nomad, and determined to assert their authority over the native society. They became a new stratum superimposed over the leading stratum of local society.19 There would inevitably be conflicts between the Russians and the native “notables,” even bloody ones, as in Bashkiria and Buriatia, but in the end, a compromise had to be negotiated between the Russians and the natives, because the Russians needed the native leaders to govern and the leaders needed the Russians to help them settle intertribal differences and put down resistance to their own\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nabuses. But that was only half the process. Russian expansion must be placed in the much larger context of a massive rollback by the settler of the nomad, who had lorded over him for so long. The nomad now had to be integrated into a rigid structure of domination prevalent in the expanding core. Once the nomad had become a settler (hopefully), he could be be incorporated into a peasantry dominated by officials and landlords. Superstratification was thus not so much a process of horizontal cooptation as a form of vertical integration into a Russiandominated social and administrative hierarchy. The native upper stratum was integrated into the lower ranks of the hierarchy, decorated with medals, and encouraged by tax exemptions to exploit their own people. The research for this work was based largely on the Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire (PSZ), first series (1649–1832) and part of the second. The first series is not, as some claim, a collection of normative acts, but one of reports and even position papers, to which the ruler appended his or her signature. Therefore, many of these documents state a policy, and it is for the scholar to trace its continuity. My intention was to discover a certain strategic vision and the means to realize it among Russian policy makers seeking hegemony over the Eurasian land mass. Besides the PSZ, I have used the valuable Review of the Interior Ministry (ZhMVD), which contains many scholarly articles based on the ministry’s archives. Many other published sources complement these basic collections. Anyone embarking on the study of a large territory faces a dilemma – to follow a territorial or topical approach. I chose the former because it makes the work more manageable, and because Russian policy makers were clearly aware – and certainly continue to be – of the existence of these three theatres. Of course, there will be a repetition of certain topics in each theatre, but a topical approach would necessitate a repetition of each theatre when discussing too many topics. The territorial approach shows much more conclusively that a policy was adapted to different theatres but had the same purpose, and was therefore consistent. I hope this work will stimulate a debate on the nature of the Russian administrative-military state. For example, it may help scholars abandon the old cliché that the Russians took part in the partitioning of “Poland” of 1772–95: they only incorporated the eastern marches of the Polish Empire (for the faint-hearted, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). We also need to reassess the reforms of Catherine II to understand her comprehensive, and perhaps unique, policy of decentralization. Much work has already been done by Nancy Kollmann on the judiciary, but I have in mind here the codification of local laws in the Baltic and western provinces. We need more work, modelled after Erika Monahan’s, on the intracontinental trade within the Russian core and its impact on the economic integration of the peripheries. Last but not least, in a country where the army has been the structural shaper of the state, its territorialization would introduce us to Russian regionalism, one of the most challenging topics in the history of Russian public administration. This work can only be a beginning. But a beginning there has to be. May it encourage others to move one.\n\nForging a Unitary State\n\nne\n\nSea of Barents\n\nMurmansk\n\nLapland\n\no\n\nly\n\narp\n\nSh\n\ne lin\n\nast\n\nCo\n\nd nte\n\nr To\n\n1. Borgå 2.

More densely settled, it formed the transition from the endless and inhospitable continental land mass to the more compact and more varied landscapes of Europe, with their indented coasts bathed in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Transitional zones partake of the two core territories and civilizations which nature has imposed upon them to join. If the western theatre can and must be seen as the northwestern end of Eurasia, it was also the northeastern end of the Atlantic basin and Latin Christian civilization. As such it was also a geopolitical frontier, where Europe and Eurasia, Latin and Orthodox Christianity, fought for hegemony for centuries. To place Sweden and Poland in Eurasia, albeit as peripheral cores, may raise eyebrows, but it is an incontrovertible fact that while both belong to Europe culturally (as members of Latin Christian civilization), they constituted the western periphery of the Eurasian land mass geologically and geopolitically. The western theatre was an oval-shaped territory centred on the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. Its western boundary was the crestline of the Scandinavian Alps separating Sweden from Norway. It crossed the Baltic to reach the Oder and followed the river to its source on the watershed separating the basin of the Baltic from that of the Danube, where Austria claimed to have an exclusive jurisdiction. It followed the Beskids past the headwaters of the San, reached the Western Bug, then followed the Pripiat, which formed the boundary with the southern theatre. It then ran along the Sozh to its headwaters near Smolensk, the strategic location controlling the watershed between the Dnieper and the Western Dvina. From there, it reached the Valdai Hills and Lake Onega, then followed the Karelian upland to Lapland on\n\n18\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nthe foothills of the Scandinavian Alps. Of the three theatres, it was the only one fully situated in the forest zone: it had no steppe land and no Cossacks. It was about three thousand kilometres long and over one thousand across between Smolensk and Stettin, a theatre of transition between the great Eurasian land mass and maritime Europe, partaking of both Eurasia and Europe, a theatre of confrontation with the eastern marches of Europe and the western marches of Eurasia. An observer situated in Moscow on the upper reaches of the Volga-­Caspian basin who looked west would see the ground rise toward the Valdai Hills ­containing – so it was believed until the nineteenth century – the highest point on the Russian plain to the Urals, as well as the watershed between the sources of the Volga, the Dnieper, and the Western Dvina. The northern extension of the Valdai Hills, Lake Onega, and the ridges of southern Finland and Karelia enclosed the basin of Lake Ladoga, the largest lake between the Atlantic and the Urals, with a basin more than twice the size of England and more than half the size of France. A lake of rough waters with a circular current driving ice floes toward the southern coast and its exit via the Neva into the Gulf of Finland, it was rich in clusters of islands in its northern section, including one on which was built, perhaps as early as the tenth century, the Valaam Transfiguration Monastery, to stand guard for Orthodoxy against the ambitions of Scandinavians and Catholics. The lake was for centuries the hub of the international trade linking the Baltic with the Black Sea and with the Caspian via the Volga. In the Middle Ages, traders brought goods from Constantinople up the Dnieper past Kiev to the Dvina. From there, they sailed down the river to Riga or down the Lovat to Lake Ilmen, where Novgorod the Great built a commercial empire based on the fur trade. From Novgorod they descended the Volkhov to Lake Ladoga – the so-called Novgorod route – and followed its southern coast to the Gulf of Finland. From the Dvina they could also go east to reach the Volga on the way to the great emporium in Kazan, the hub for the Caspian and Central Asian trade. Goods like wax, honey, and furs went the other way, to Constantinople and the Mediterranean. The creation of Arkhangelsk in 1584 and the opening up of the Russian far north lessened the importance of Lake Ladoga, but the emergence of Sweden restored its importance. The Swedes saw the incorporation of the lake and its basin as a means to control the interior, deep into the Russian land. The lake also received Lake Onega, eighteen times the size of Lake Geneva, via the Svir. With its two outstretched fingers pointing north, Lake Onega showed the way to the White Sea, as a king of Sweden would later discover and which the Soviet government would seek to develop – with disastrous results. But its importance lay in the connection it established via the Vytegra and the Kovzha with the White Lake (Belo-ozero), and south of it, via the Sheksna,\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 19\n\nwith the Volga at Rybinsk. This was the route followed by caravans from Central Asia and the Caspian on their way to Novgorod. Those lakes and rivers, connected by portages1 before the age of canals in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, were not easily navigable because of many obstacles: strong northern winds causing shipwrecks; low and swampy shores; rapids caused by glacial moraines; shallow beds with an imperceptible gradient, which froze for several months and had too little water in the summer. Nevertheless, the river beds and lake shores remained preferable to the unreliable trails across a forested land. A second waterway linked the Volga with the Baltic, also starting at Rybinsk. Here, grain, salt, and iron came from the Urals, the mid- and lower Volga region, on their way to Petersburg. It followed the Mologa, then the Charodoshcha, a few smaller rivers, and then the Tikhvinka and the Sias, which drained into Lake Ladoga, a short distance east of the Volkhov estuary. These two routes became known in the nineteenth century as the Mariinskii and Tikhvinskii waterways respectively. The age of canals may be said to have begun with Peter I, who built a third route, shorter, more dangerous, and eventually less profitable. The Tvertsa drained into the Volga at Tver. It began in a swampy depression filled by Lake Mstimo, out of which flowed the Msta, which after a long detour, made dangerous by the twenty-six Borovichi rapids, drained into Lake Ilmen, and linked up with the Novgorod route on the Volkhov. It was built by hard labourers, including fifteen thousand Little Russian Cossacks, and many more sacrificed their lives to assert Russia’s claim to hegemony in the eastern Baltic. All these waterways, linked by portages, formed a continuous system stretching from the Caspian to the Baltic. The westernmost end of the system was also the westernmost rim of the Eurasian land mass centred on the Caspian basin. Petersburg may have been a European city, its glare fixed on Europe, but its survival depended on a constant supply of all its basic necessities from the interior of Eurasia: a European city, but the capital, not of European Russia, but of a Eurasian empire. This Eurasian corridor continued westwards into Finland. Beyond Lake Ladoga the ground rose toward Lake Saimaa, draining into Lake Ladoga via the Vuoksi, a lazy river looking more like a succession of pools in an indifferent and sparsely populated landscape. The lake is at about eighty metres of elevation above sea level and is itself the drainage basin of other elongated and deeply incised lakes, stretching along the Karelian border to the east and beyond Kuopio in the north. West of this enormous waterway lay Lake Paijanne with its 640 sister lakes forming the watershed between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Bothnia. It drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Kiumenne (Kymi) at Lovitsa and Kotka. Further west lay Lake Nasi (Näsijärvi), draining into the Gulf of Bothnia at Björneborg (Pori).\n\n20\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nFinland has been called the land of the one thousand lakes; in fact, there may be more than fifty-five thousand, most of them closely packed in the central Lake Region. Its appearance suggests “a level shore, recently forsaken by the tide,”2 a striking similarity with the coast of the southern Ukraine (New Russia, Novorossiya), where inland shells remind the visitor that it once was under the waters of the Black Sea. To the south of the Lake Region, an amphitheatre of three parallel ridges of glacial mud and gravel, called the Saupasselka, separates it from the coastal strip of the Gulf of Finland. Together with the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, facing Sweden below Björneborg, the strip was the most populated part of Finland, where Swedes predominated. Only 8 per cent of Finland is arable and grassland, 46 per cent consists of forest and lakes, and the rest is largely swamp. The country’s interior, the Lake Region, is unfit for agriculture. North of it, the ground continues to rise all the way to the headwaters of the Torneo and Muonio near the Swedish and Norwegian border. But the whole of Finland beyond the basin of Lake Ladoga descends gently toward the Gulf of Bothnia, a large trough separating Finland from Sweden; at the Kvarken, it is only seventy kilometres wide and only twenty if one begins at the islands. Sweden is the land of another fifty-five thousand lakes, but many are mountain lakes.The Swedish coast rises rapidly toward the Scandinavian Alps.3 They are difficult to cross, and several heights exceed 1,800 metres. The Crestline forms the boundary of western Eurasia, and beyond it lies the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. If we look back upon the topography of this northern sector of the western theatre, we find an almost completely self-enclosed world of Sweden and Finland bowing to each other across the Gulf of Bothnia, but on the whole forming a huge extension of the basin of Lake Ladoga. Its orientation was not western, was barely southern toward Baltic shores, but definitely eastern toward the Eurasian land mass, of which it constituted the westernmost end. A short distance from the Pola descending toward Lake Ilmen and the Volga beginning its long voyage to the Caspian, the 920-kilometre-long Western Dvina turned southwest toward Beshenkovichi, from which a portage linked the river with the Dnieper. It then swerved abruptly westward toward Dünaburg (Dvinsk, Daugavpils) and then northwards toward Riga, the greatest port in the eastern Baltic from medieval days to the eighteenth century. Immense timber rafts steered by Russian Gypsies carried the products of Russian and Polish forests, and the hemp and flax so highly prized in Europe. It was a dangerous river to navigate because of its rapids, especially those between Kokenhusen (Koknese) and Jacobstadt (Ekabpils), which ranked in importance after those of the Msta and the Dnieper (Dnipro). But it had once been part of the waterway from the Black to the Baltic Seas, and Tsar Ivan IV could still say in the sixteenth century that its banks were made of silver and its bottom was made of gold.4\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 21\n\nThe Dvina was the first of a number of rivers draining toward the semicircular coast of the southeastern Baltic, each with a major port at its mouth. Beshenkovichi was near the confluence of the Ulla and the Dvina. The Ulla linked it via a portage, later a canal, with the Berezina, known in history as the river which Charles XII crossed on his way to Poltava and Napoleon crossed on his way back to France. The Berezina led to the heights of Minsk, where the Niemen began its nine-hundred-kilometre course across Lithuania to the swampy coast of the Kurisches Haff. Boats entered it to dock at Memel (Klaiped) in Prussia. Like almost all the rivers of this region, and like almost all the rivers of the Eurasian land mass, navigation on it was obstructed by rapids, low gradient, occasional boulders, dead trees, and sandbars, but the river was also the only means of communication after the thaw set in and the country became an impassable swamp. The Niemen also carried mostly timber and timber materials, typical products of Eurasia, for which there always was a great demand in the German lands. The Niemen was easily connected with the Vistula. A string of lakes forming the Augustow canal led to the Bebrza (Bobr), which flowed into the Narew, the latter into the Western Bug descending from the Volhynian upland and draining into the Vistula downstream from Warsaw. The Narew could also be reached via the Zelvianka, a tributary of the Niemen, past the famous Belovezh Pushcha, an enormous hunting preserve known for the variety and abundance of its game, including the almost extinct bison. All these rivers were insignificant. Indeed, their importance was greater in olden days, when boats were smaller and loads lighter, than in the nineteenth century, and they flowed across a desolate swampland. The triangle formed by the Narew and the Bebzha formed the Byalystok region; Prussia, which acquired it in 1795, was only too happy to turn it over to Russia in 1807. The Vistula (Wisla) was the longest (about one thousand kilometres) of all the rivers draining into the Baltic. The size of its basin, about two hundred thousand square kilometres, was almost as large as Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Vistula gathered into itself all the rivers of Poland, if we also include the Warta descending from the Czestochowa-Kraków plateau at 535 metres of elevation. The Warta once flowed into a swampy depression filled by Lake Goplo, now much smaller, which linked it with the Vistula. Some scholars still consider it reasonable to include the Warta among the tributaries of the Vistula, draining the western part of Poland to Silesia, the valley of the Oder.5 But while the Vistula was the symbol of Poland, it was not very useful as a transportation medium. It took its source in the Beskids, a northern spur of the Carpathians on the Slovak border, flowed northeastward until it received the San, which divided Galicia into two halves, the Polish and the Ukrainian. It was navigable over a very short distance and prone to devastating floods. The Przemysl Gate separated it from the headwaters of the Dniester.\n\n22\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nThe river then turned north, picked up the Wieprz, where it became navigable for more than flat-bottom boats, and entered near Warsaw a low-lying corridor, which led to the sea. Before reaching the sea, it divided into two branches, the Vistula proper and the Nogat. The latter flowed into the Frisches Haff (Zalew Wislany) past Elblag (Elbing) and entered the Baltic west of Königsberg (Kaliningrad). The Vistula proper divided again into two branches, one called the Elbing Vistula, also draining into the Frisches Haff, the other, called the Danzig Vistula, named after the port of Danzig (Gdansk). With Riga, it was the most important port of the eastern Baltic and the outlet for Polish exports of grain and timber from all the way in Volhynia sent down the Western Bug. West of the Vistula there remained only the Oder (Odra), about nine hundred kilometres long. It took its source a short distance west of the Vistula on the Czech border. It flowed northwest across Silesia, then turned sharply west and then north, to drain into the Stettin Haff, named after the port of Stettin (Szczecin), almost blocked from the sea by three large islands. A notable feature was that it received no affluents from the west: the Neisse, the presentday border between Germany and Poland, comes from the south and forms a kind of forward defence line protecting the Oder. The Oder “was a strong barrier protecting Poland against its western neighbors” (1942); it protected “Poland in the west, like a solid wall, against the Germans and other Slavs” (1803); the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (1135–90) regarded it as “the rampart of Poland.”6 Like the Scandinavian Alps in the north, it was the perfect boundary of western Eurasia in the south. From there, or at least from the Vistula, began the land of the forest – 70 per cent of Poland consisted of coniferous forests. “The prison of those Polish pines / How it shuts off from all things dear” (in Europe), bemoaned a German officer in 1915.7 These coniferous forests continued without interruption across the whole of Eurasia all the way to the Pacific. Each of the three theatres had its own sea, but if they eventually led to the great oceans, their shores were not hospitable to traders and the development of a flourishing maritime civilization. The Baltic Sea offered more favourable conditions than the Sea of Okhotsk or the Black Sea, but its major ports owed their development more to their being outlets for the raw materials of western Eurasia than to the economic growth of their local base, except for Petersburg. Shorn of its imperial attributes, however, the capital was no more than a great commercial city for the transit trade between Europe and Eurasia. The Baltic Sea was once part of the Ancylus Sea, a marshy plain extending from the Atlantic to the Urals, until the ocean drowned the western part to form the North Sea, which merges with the Atlantic Ocean.8 The remainder became the Baltic Sea, and Finland still continues to rise above its level at the rate of about ninety centimetres a century. The sea exits into the North Sea through three channels, the Sound between Sweden and Denmark, and the\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 23\n\nGreat and Little Belts of Denmark. The Sound is the major one because it is unencumbered by islands and sharp turns. Its depth does not exceed seven metres: it was used by sailing ships but can no longer be navigated by large modern ships. Baltic waters are almost entirely fresh; very little water enters from the North Sea, unlike the Black Sea where a strong Mediterranean current runs under the layer of lighter fresh water from the Dnieper and other rivers. Therefore, “the Baltic basin constitutes the selfcontained basin of a typical continental sea, almost completely cut off from other oceanic influences.”9 At least three consequences follow. Tidal movement is almost completely absent; ports freeze up for at least part of the long winters; marine life is poor: the celebrated Baltic herring of medieval days is in fact no bigger than a sardine and the cod only about one-fifth of the weight of those found on the Norway coast. The sea is 1,700 kilometres long from Kiel to Haparanda at the far end of the Gulf of Bothnia. Its largest island is Gotland, its largest archipelago, that of the Åland Islands at the entrance of the Gulf. Its greatest depth reaches 300 metres off Gotland, but most of the sea is between 25 and 100 metres deep. At about the latitude of Stockholm, it branches out into the Gulf of Bothnia, 670 kilometres long, whose northern part is under ice for from six to seven months. It separates Sweden from Finland, and the latter’s isolation did much to cultivate separatist sentiments among even the Swedes of Finland. The other branch is the Gulf of Finland, about 430 kilometres long, under ice for from five to six months, at the tip of which the Swedes built a profitable commercial outlet in the seventeenth century and the Russians a capital in the eighteenth. The northern coast is sharply indented, the southern coast is smooth The existence of a rotating current, encouraged by westerly winds, emphasizes the nearly self-enclosed nature of the sea, and explains the creation of lagoons (each called a Haff), nearly blocked by great sandspits capped by dunes, with a narrow opening through which the rivers finally reach the sea. All in all the Baltic Sea was not an open sea in the traditional sense, but a large pool draining in circular fashion all the important rivers of western Eurasia. Only beyond its western exits did Europe’s maritime civilization begin. Geopolitics The early political history of western Eurasia was marked in the thirteenth century by a concerted assault from Europe and Latin Christianity upon the Russian and Orthodox lands, the so-called Drang nach Osten. It was led mostly by German knights. Later came Polish and Swedish expansion within western Eurasia, converging on the Dvina and the Gulf of Finland, followed by a destructive war between Poland and Sweden, which opened the way for Russia’s Drang nach Westen beginning in the seventeenth century.\n\n24\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nThere were six crusades between 1095 and 1229, inspired by a Latin Christian ideal to convert schismatics and infidels to the true faith, and give employment to idle knights, together with the chance of capturing booty and creating fiefs in lands that were much richer than those of Europe. The crusaders fanned out in two directions: toward the Holy Land, occupied by Muslims, and against Orthodox Christianity, whose capital, Constantinople, the most splendid medieval city, they sacked in 1204 at the end of the fourth crusade. This need not concern us here. In the north, the crusaders focused on the southern coast of the Baltic all the way to the Gulf of Finland, in order to convert native tribes in present-day northern Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and to destroy the Orthodox stronghold in Novgorod, from where missionaries and traders were moving into the eastern Baltic and Finland.10 Germans had been coming from Westphalia (capital Münster) and Lübeck since the twelfth century via Visby on Gotland Island to trade and settle in Livonia (Livland), the land of the Latvians. The first bishop (1186–96) had his capital in Uxküll on the lower Dvina, but the third, Albrecht von Buxhoeveden (1199–1229), moved his see to Riga, which he founded in 1202.11 His descendant would command Russian troops invading Finland six hundred years later. That same year, he founded the Order of the Sword Bearers headed by a master (Meister) with a mission to convert the pagans and fight Orthodoxy; he later became the pope’s highest representative in the region with the rank of archbishop. Twelve years earlier, in 1190, the Teutonic Order was founded in Acre in the Holy Land to care for the German sick during the third crusade, but it later withdrew to Venice. It was headed by a grand master (Hochmeister), who governed with the help of commanders forming a council or chapter (kapitul). Grand Master Hermann von Salza (1210–39) saw an opportunity in 1226, when Conrad of Mazovia, the Polish lord of the middle Vistula region, asked the Order to exterminate the Prussians, who blocked Poland’s access to the Baltic. They did, settled down, founded Danzig in 1235 and Elbing in 1237, and established their capital at Marienburg (Malbork) on the Nogat. Also in 1237, they incorporated the Sword Bearers, who became the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, but the pope insisted that they must take the oath of fealty to the archbishop in Riga. The knights inaugurated a “continual crusade,” “a permanent presence with a vested interest in growth,”12 as the papacy’s strike force against Novgorod and Orthodoxy), but they were decisively beaten in 1242 on Lake Peipus (Chud) by Alexander Nevsky. The lake and the Narova River would become and remain to this day the boundary between the Russian lands and the Baltic peoples south of the Gulf of Finland. The Order, whose possessions extended from eastern Pomerania to the Gulf of Finland, formed a “state” (Ordenstaat), and imposed upon the native population an exceptionally brutal rule, especially in Livonia and Estonia (Estland), purchased from Denmark in 1347. But a triangle of rivalries soon developed\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 25\n\nbetween them and the Riga archbishop, from whom they sought their autonomy, and the merchants of Riga, who sought freedom from both Grand Master and bishop. As a result, a “state” did not truly develop in the Baltic provinces, but instead, a maze of conflicting jurisdictions which would mark the political life of those provinces until 1917. But the Order’s growth was constrained by the completion of the conversion drive, the resulting weakening of the Order’s resolve, and the growth of Polish power. The Order attempted to convert Samogitia, “the heart of ethnic Lithuania … and the last independent island separating German possessions in Prussia and in Lithuania,” but could not keep it.13 If the Order blocked Poland’s access to the sea, Poland blocked the Order’s inland expansion. Like the Little Russian Cossacks after 1775, the soldier-monks lost their raison d’être once their purpose had vanished. They began to marry – the celibacy rule had cultivated over the centuries a racism toward Slavs and others which never truly abated – had children and other heirs, and became landowners. In 1410, they were crushed by Poland at the famous battle of Tannenberg (Stetbark), and after a long war (1454–66) Poland gained West Prussia, Danzig, and Thorn (Torun). The Grand Master moved to Königsberg, but had to recognize himself a vassal of the Polish king. The territory would become known as Royal Prussia until 1772, and the remainder of the Order’s possessions, as East Prussia.14 The sixteenth century was the great turning point. Martin Luther (1483–1546) posted his ninety-five theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg on the Elbe in 1517, and the Protestant Reformation began. Like the crusaders and colonists of past centuries, Luther’s ideas quickly spread eastward and influenced Grand Master Albrecht von Hohenzollern (Brandenburg)-Ansbach (1511–68). In 1525, he transformed his lands into a secular state with himself as duke, while still recognizing the Polish king as his suzerain. He thereby seized the properties of the Catholic Church in his territory. Then Livonia fell prey to Russo-Swedish-Polish rivalries against which the Order was powerless. In 1561 the Livonian master, Gotthard Kettler, made himself Duke of Kurland, the southern rump of Livonia, and he too became a vassal of the Polish crown. The Ordenstaat had come to an end, but a new Prussia was being born, which one day would unite the lands of the German crusaders and destroy the Russian empire. While the Germans were creating a “new Germania”15 on the southern shores of the Baltic, a powerful state was emerging in Poland. The country managed to escape the German onslaught because its prince, Mieszko I (960–992), had converted to Latin Christianity in 966 and placed his lands under the protection of the Pope. Roman Catholicism had found a forward position against Russian Orthodoxy and a core area suitable for building an empire dedicated to the containment of an expanding Russian core. An archbishopric was created in Gniezno, with bishoprics in Poznan, Kraków, and Wroclaw (in Silesia) between\n\n26\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\n968 and 1000, two hundred years before the foundation of Riga. A Piast dynasty began with Mieszko’s son Boleslaw I (992–1025), which would last until 1370. It united Little Poland (the valley of the upper Vistula with Kraków) in 1305 and Great Poland (the valley of the middle Oder and the Warta with Poznan) in 1314. Casimir the Great (1333–70) founded the University of Kraków in 1364, but left no son. Fourteen years later, the Poles accepted one of his nieces, Jadwiga, as their queen (1384–98), and arranged for her to marry Jagiello, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. They founded the Jagellonian dynasty (1386–1572). Jagiello ruled as King of Poland (1386–1434) and Grand Duke (1382–1401).16 The union of Poland and Lithuania was a momentous event. Among other things, it created a mortal threat to the Teutonic Order. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had begun with Gedymin (1316–41), who resided in Vilnius. He united more closely the Lithuanian and Belorussian lands and forged a centralized military state which rapidly expanded eastward. It eventually reached the boundaries of the grand principalities of Moscow and Riazan and the republic of Novgorod. Lithuania was an overextended territorial conglomerate which needed the superior resources of Poland. When Jagiello converted to Latin Christianity, the influence of Catholicism grew exponentially. The Grand Duchy drew Poland eastward, transformed it into a crusading state, much more capable of challenging Orthodoxy than the Teutonic Knights could ever do. The emerging conflict with Russia (and Sweden) helped define the western theatre within Eurasia. Poland acquired an eastern mission, which it would retain until it turned westward during the first decade of the twenty-first century. The union of Krewo (Krevo) of 1386 was intended to be more than a personal and dynastic union; it was meant to be a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland, with Catholicism as the official religion and Lithuanian nobles enjoying the same privileges as the Polish ruling class (szlachta). But the Lithuanians had already developed a strong identity, and resentment brought about the election of Jagiello’s cousin, Witold (Vitovt), as Grand Duke of Lithuania (1401–30). The Lithuanians had carried out attacks on Russian lands, including Moscow, in 1368 and 1370, and become involved in Muscovite politics. Witold seized Smolensk in 1395 and had designs on Novgorod, but he chose to focus on the Ukrainian provinces of Lithuania. He died in 1340 before he could succeed. By that time, it seemed that the policy of “gathering the Russian lands” would be carried out not by Moscow but by Lithuania: Witold’s daughter married Vasilii I (1389–1425), who in his testament of 1423 left his wife and sons to the protection of the mighty Witold; soon afterwards, Tver and Riazan recognized Witold as their suzerain.17 But not for long. With the accession of Ivan III (1462–1505), Moscow assumed the leadership. It gathered Novgorod in 1478, Tver in 1485. Ivan’s son Vasilii III (1505–33) annexed the frontier city of Smolensk in 1514 and Riazan\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 27\n\nin 1517. Meanwhile, Ivan III had married the only niece of the last Byzantine emperor (1449–53) and become the defender of Eastern Orthodoxy against Islam and Catholicism. Since Witold’s death, the military efficiency of Lithuania had considerably declined and the natural attraction of Eastern Orthodoxy had much increased. A geopolitical rivalry between Russia and Poland over Lithuania was becoming a religious one as well. The Reformation found an echo in Lithuania, but the Catholic Church retaliated with the CounterReformation. It began with the creation of the Jesuit Order in 1540 and the summoning of the Council of Trent in 1545. The Jesuits, headed by a “general,” became the soldier-crusaders of the papacy, worthy descendants of the Teutonic Knights, but without their brutality and racism. Instead, they relied on education in various “missions,” schools and academies, which they opened in increasing numbers across Lithuania all the way to Polotsk on the Dvina facing Smolensk on the road to Moscow. The turbulence created by the Reformation and Counter-Reformation in Lithuania and Livonia, and the resulting rapprochement between the two countries, worried Moscow. When Master Kettler and the Riga archbishop accepted the incorporation of Livonia into the Polish empire in 1561, Ivan IV (1533–84) in Moscow saw this as a casus belli, bringing about a twenty-year war between 1561 and 1582. The Polish empire during the reigns of Sigismund I (1506–48) and Sigismund II August (1548–72) marked the zenith of Polish political and cultural influence, the high-water mark of Polish Protestantism, but also the appearance of the Jesuits in 1565. The Union of Lublin (1569), when Sigismund II incorporated the Volhynian and Podolian provinces of Lithuania into the Polish core (korona), created an indivisible body politic between Poland and Lithuania. It also shifted Poland’s centre of gravity eastward and brought it into direct contact with the confessional frontier between Catholicism and Orthodoxy in Belorussia.18 The stage was being set for the momentous conflict with Russia. Paradoxically, Sigismund’s death brought about the end of the Jagellonian dynasty and introduced the period of the elective kings, beginning with the “Henrician Articles” of 1573, which transformed Poland into an elective monarchy (“republic”), fated to be torn apart by internal discord until it fell prey to the ambitions of Russia and Prussia (and Austria). While these developments were taking place on the southern shores of the Baltic and the open plain between the Niemen, the Dvina, and the upper Dnieper, another conflict had been brewing for centuries between Scandinavians and Russians. Eric IX of Sweden (1150–60) launched a crusade against the pagan Finns in 1157, imposed Christianity in the Åbo region (Finnish Turku, meaning a trading place), and founded a colony. A century later, in 1240, the Swedes reached the mouth of the Neva, but were stopped by Alexander Nevsky (1220–63), prince of Novgorod. Novgorodians and Swedes became natural\n\n28\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nrivals in the basin of Lake Ladoga, where the fur trade had made the wealth of Novgorod. In 1249, the Swedes founded Tavastborg (Tavastehus) on the southern rim of the Lake Region and, in 1293, Vyborg on the Vuoksa, the centre of Finnish Karelia, where Orthodoxy had already made some inroads; they hoped to make it a springboard for the conquest of Lake Ladoga’s basin. In 1300 they built Nienshants on a stream near where Peter I would lay the foundations of Petersburg four hundred years later, but it was destroyed by the Novgorodians in 1301. In 1310 they built Keksholm, a fort which gave them a foothold on Lake Saimaa and a backup position to defend Vyborg. The Novgorodians countered by building a fort at Orekhov (Noteborg), on an island formed by the two branches of the Neva exiting Lake Ladoga, but it was taken by the Swedes in 1328. An attempt was made to reach a modus vivendi. The Treaty of Noteborg in 1323, the year the fort was built, contained a vague attempt to establish a border running from the Narova River along the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, across Kotlin Island to the Sestra stream, across the Lake Region to the end of the Gulf of Bothnia and to the Varanger fjord. Traders seem to have ignored it because the stakes were so high, but armed conflicts were avoided when both Sweden and Novgorod became torn by internal strife.19 The situation changed radically following the annexation of Novgorod by Ivan III. Muscovy inherited the city’s claims in the Baltic sector, just as it would assume the inheritance of the Kipchak Khanate in the 1550s and that of Kievan Rus’ in the 1650s. Muscovy was becoming a Eurasian power and would henceforth seek to assert its hegemony in western Eurasia. His grandson Ivan IV was drawn into the vacuum created by the secularization of the Teutonic Order and by Swedish and Polish rivalry. He invaded Livonia in 1558, but Estland placed itself under Swedish suzerainty, Livonia passed under Lithuania, Kurland became a fief of Poland, and Ösel Island went to Demark. Russia found itself at war with both Poland-Lithuania and Sweden.20 In the meantime, a Swedish nobleman, Gustav Vasa, founded a new dynasty bearing his name (1523–1818). Sweden became Lutheran. The war, which had begun well for the Russians, turned against them, especially during the reign of Stefan Batory (1575–86), who inflicted disastrous defeats on them and even almost took Pskov. Moscow had to abandon all its acquisitions in Livonia in 1582, and give up the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland from Narva to Lake Ladoga to the Swedes in 1583. Muscovy had been cut off from the Baltic, but Arkhangelsk opened a new way to Europe. The geopolitical situation became extremely confused between 1584 and 1612. Russian weakness, the end of Moscow’s Riurikid dynasty – which went back to the Scandinavian chieftain Rurik, “invited” to rule over Novgorod in 862 – and the short and disastrous reign of Boris Godunov, followed by the so-called Time of Troubles (1605–12), invited Swedish and Polish intervention, but not always military. We encounter the first projects of union between the\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 29\n\ncrowns of Poland, Sweden, and Russia, which came almost to fruition in 1809 and 1815, when the tsar-emperor became Grand Duke of Finland and King of Poland. Finland was a duchy in an emerging Swedish empire, and Gustav Vasa’s younger brother Johan became duke of that eastern land. He married Catherine, sister of Sigismund II August, and became King of Sweden as Johan III (1568–92). When Sigismund died without issue, and with him the Jagellonian dynasty in 1672, Johan inherited both crowns, creating, on paper, a formidable competitor for Russia, capable of uniting western Eurasia. The endemic rivalry with Denmark had already resulted in Sweden’s acquiring Estland in 1572. When Johan died in 1592, his son became King of Poland and Sweden: he had already succeeded Batory in Poland in 1587. But the union would not last. Sigismund III (1587–1632) was narrow-minded, obstinate, and a staunch Catholic, who antagonized his Lutheran subjects. They deposed him in 1599, but he would remain King of Poland until 1632. He was succeeded in Sweden by his uncle Charles, who became king as Charles IX, not crowned until 1607, and who died in 1611. His son, Gustav II Adolf, would become Sweden’s greatest king (1611–32).21 In 1586, Batory had sent a mission to Moscow offering a dynastic union: if he died before Fedor, Ivan IV’s son (1584–98), the latter would become King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, while remaining tsar in Moscow. If Fedor died first, the reverse would apply. Nothing came of it: Batory died that same year and Moscow refused to consider the offer,22 which was intended to harness Muscovy to fulfil one of Poland’s greatest ambitions: to lead a crusade against the Ottoman Turks under the auspices of the Pope to create a Polish empire from sea (Baltic) to sea (Black). In 1600, Sapieha, a Lithuanian grandee, went even further: Muscovy would be included into the Polish empire like another Lithuania. This may have been directed against Poland’s overbearing influence. But by 1609, when Muscovy’s disintegration was reaching its final stage, Sigismund III marched on Smolensk, where an agreement was reached in February 1610: his son Władysław would be crowned tsar in Moscow by the Orthodox patriarch, convert to Orthodoxy, and take an Orthodox bride. But Sigismund nullified it, when he announced that he himself wanted to be tsar. Muscovy would thus have a Catholic ruler, a non-negotiable position for the Russians. A foreign prince was acceptable, but not a schismatic one.23 The Poles continued their advance and entered Moscow in August 1610, but were soon expelled by a violent reaction led by the Orthodox Church, and Michael I was elected the first tsar of the new Romanov dynasty in February 1613. The opportunity had passed to unite most of western Eurasia under Polish leadership; it would never return. At first, the Russians were more successful against the Swedes. In 1590 they reoccupied the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland (Ingria), but could not\n\n30\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\ntake Narva. Charles IX too had vast ambitions: not only to keep Ingria but also to annex Novgorod and Pskov as well as Karelia and the Kola Peninsula on the White Sea. The Swedes then took both cities and entered Moscow in January 1610 – the decisive event which prompted the Poles to do the same. An agreement signed in July 1611 made Novgorod into a Swedish protectorate, and a Swedish prince would become tsar in Moscow. But Gustav Adolf, like Sigismund, overplayed his hand: he would not let his brother become tsar, but would seek the title himself. For the Novgorodians a schismatic prince from hated Latin Christendom was as unacceptable as it was for the Muscovites. He had to desist in the summer of 1612.24 And thus three centuries of rivalry, commercial, military, and diplomatic, had ended in a draw. But such a prolonged rivalry had shaped a strategic theatre in the northwestern end of Eurasia. Poles, Lithuanians, and Swedes had always moved east, Russians west, for the control of a common frontier including the basin of Lake Ladoga and the hydrographic infrastructure of Lithuania. A new phase in that never-ending rivalry was about to begin after 1613. The Russian Advance The new Russian dynamism manifested itself very quickly. By the end of 1614, there was already violent opposition to Swedish rule in Novgorod, and Gustav Adolf had to lift the siege of Pskov in the summer of 1615. In October, negotiations began at Stolbovo near Tikhvin, southeast of Lake Ladoga, but an agreement was not signed until February 1617. The Swedes abandoned Novgorod, but Russia had to cede Karelia, Ingria with the mouth of the Neva, and Kotlin Island. The country was once again cut off from the Gulf of Finland. The Swedes had created a strategic frontier running from Estland past the eastern shores of Lake Ladoga to the Karelian upland forming the watershed between the Lake Region of Finland and the basin of the White Sea. The agreement was not a disaster:25 Russia’s hold on the Neva had always been tenuous, and the circumstances in which Russia had regained it in 1590 had distinctly been unfavourable. On the other hand, Sweden was definitely on the defensive: it had not reached the White Sea and had lost Novgorod. This appears clearly from two speeches delivered by the king before the Swedish parliament. In January 1617, he was confident that Lake Ladoga, the swamps of Ingria, and the “turbulent Narova” blocked Russia’s access to the gulf, for war or trade purposes, “without our special permission.” But in August, the emphasis had changed: he had become aware of the capabilities of “our enemy the Russian,” his “appallingly large armies,” and his ability to use the hydrographic network of western Eurasia to transport them “on the Caspian and up the Volga and down the Volkhov, and along the Dvina and the Niemen to\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 31\n\nLivonia.”26 Was the king already aware that Russia was a Volga-Caspian-based power, capable of projecting great power across the whole of western Eurasia? Poland too was on the defensive. Sigismund III did not recognize the election of Michael, but was willing to settle for Władysław. The Poles moved against Moscow once again, reached it in October 1618, but could not take it. An armistice was signed for fourteen years. Sigismund died in 1632 while preparing a religious crusade against Muscovy with the help of the Catholic and Uniate churches, but his son, now Władysław IV (1632–48), could only take Smolensk. Poland’s ambitions no longer matched its capabilities. The “eternal peace” of June 1634 left Smolensk in Polish hands, but the king recognized Michael and gave up his claims to the Muscovite throne.27 The threat now came from Ukraine, where turbulence among the Cossacks announced the great uprising of 1648, in which Russia would gradually become involved to begin the dismemberment of the Polish empire. Swedish policy after Stolbovo focused on the old enemy, Denmark, and on northern Germany, where Gustav Adolf had fought to become the leader of the Protestant cause. It was there that he lost his life, at the battle of Lützen west of Leipzig in November 1632, seven months after Sigismund III. But his faithful chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, shared the same ambitions in the Baltic. Sweden must become a great naval power capable of imposing its hegemony in what must become a Swedish lake.28 But a naval policy is usually the handmaiden of a commercial policy. Sweden, with little good land and a small population, must gain control of all the estuaries of the rivers flowing into that sea and access to their hinterlands: Bremen on the Weser, Hamburg on the Elbe, Stettin on the Oder, Danzig on the Vistula, Königsberg and Memel (Klaipeda) on the Pregel and Niemen, Riga on the Dvina, and a still undeveloped location on the Neva. A Swedish merchant marine would drain the products of Muscovy and Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, and Silesia. All trade routes would lead to Swedishcontrolled ports. But such a policy contained the seeds of a permanent conflict with the Polish empire. The endemic conflict with Denmark was already consuming much of Sweden’s energy and resources. In the end, the destruction of Poland would also eliminate one of Muscovy’s major opponents and leave Sweden alone to face the rising Muscovite core, which would then destroy Sweden’s hegemony. Sweden was on the defensive during the long reign of Charles XI (1660–97). Its fifth war with Denmark was a disaster. The Danes took Wismar in 1675 and crushed the Swedish fleet off Oland Island in 1676. The Swedes lost control of the Baltic, of Wolin and Usedom, and Stettin capitulated in 1677. They lost Greifswald and Rügen Island. War on land and at sea exhausted the resources of the country, and the government had to raise the fiscal burden and, more importantly, turn against the nobility, both in Sweden and in Estland and Livland, who had encroached upon crown lands to enlarge their properties.\n\n32\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nThe so-called Reduktion antagonized the nobility as the ruling class of the provinces. The knights traced their origins to the Livonian and Teutonic Orders, and many were already anti-Swedish. By antagonizing the Baltic nobility, the Swedish government would encourage their switch of allegiance during the Northern War of 1700–21. Reducing the importance of the nobility in Sweden strengthened the monarchy; reducing it in Estland and Livland undermined the stability of the empire. Jan Sobiecki died in June 1696; Charles XI in April 1697; in May Peter I left Moscow for his grand tour of Europe. A new era was about to begin. Peter I (1689–1725) was a strong and healthy youth, curious, enamoured of the sea and, unlike his predecessors, not distrustful of foreigners. Charles XII of Sweden (1697–1718) was a gifted and precocious youth of high morality, but obstinate to the point of obduracy; no one yet guessed that he possessed military talents of the highest order. As to August II (1697–1733), elected from among eighteen candidates partly as a result of Russian pressure, the most generous thing to be said about him was that he could bend a horseshoe in his bare hands and was “one of the most unscrupulous scoundrels ever to ascend the ill-fated throne of Poland.”29 Sweden had been collecting significant revenue from its control of the Baltic ports and the channelling of the Russian trade toward Lake Ladoga and the Neva away from Arkhangelsk. There was a threat of Russia becoming economically dependent on Sweden. It had long been part of the “Great Eastern Program” of the Swedish monarchy to consolidate a Swedish takeover of the Russian trade in the region.30 Commercial rivalry with Sweden created a natural alliance between Russia and Poland, but other ambitions created a potential conflict. Augustus wanted to regain Livonia with Riga; this would also put him on a collision course with Russia. Peter had visited Kurland on his way back and had become aware of its ports such as Libava (Liepaia) and Vindava (Ventspils), as well as of its rich oak forests, so suitable for shipbuilding. The reconquest of Livonia would strengthen the king’s position in Lithuania, where the powerful Sapieha family refused to recognize him, but the Russians too had designs on Lithuania. Nevertheless, an alliance was forged in 1699 with Poland and Denmark: its major purpose was to expel the Swedes from their beachheads. The high point of the Northern War of 1700–21 came in 1709. In the summer of 1707, Charles led “his magnificent army”31 out of Saxony toward the east. The destination was Moscow. But the strategic picture had changed. The Russians had nibbled at the Swedish position. In 1703 they had taken the Neva and laid the foundation of a new capital at the site of Nien. They were once again on the Gulf of Finland. In 1704 they had retaken Narva, and they now threatened both the Baltic provinces and Finland. The king chose not to see. But the scorched-earth policy pursued by the Russians began to take its toll after the Swedes crossed the Dnieper in July 1708. Instead of moving north\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 33\n\nto find provisions and meet the Russians, who were now threatening his rear, the king turned south to winter in Little Russia with the support of Hetman Mazepa. The winter of 1708–9 was one of the coldest in living memory and inflicted more losses on the Swedes. The Russians checkmated them on the edge of the steppe. The result was the catastrophic battle of Poltava in June 1709.32 The Swedish army was annihilated and the king forced to flee into Ottoman territory. Charles XII had lost the war. The Russians then counterattacked in the north. Vyborg capitulated, then Keksholm, Reval, Riga, and Pernau, all in 1710. That same year, Peter married off his niece Anna to the Duke of Kurland and established a foothold in that Polish fief. The Danes joined the fray. The Russians built a fleet – the nightmare of Gustav Adolf – which defeated the Swedish fleet at the battle of Hangö in June 1714. The occupation of the Åland Islands brought the Russians within fifteen miles of Stockholm. Charles returned from captivity in November 1714, and turned on the Danes, who were threatening an invasion of Sweden, but he was killed, probably by one of his men, in December 1718. The Swedes still refused to surrender, despite the unravelling of their position and the loss of all their beachheads, until April 1721, when the Treaty of Nystadt gave Russia Ingria, Estonia, and Livonia, Ösel and Dagden (Khiruma) Islands, and the Vyborg district of Karelia. The Russians returned Finland, which they had occupied in 1714. Sweden would never recover from its defeat. Another war with Russia in 1742–3 resulted in another occupation of Finland, the stationing of Russian troops in Stockholm, and the annexation of another strip of Finnish territory by the Treaty of Åbo (Turku) of January 1743. Hesitant Integration Centre and Province The annexation of Estland, Livland, and Vyborg provinces presented the Russian government with unprecedented problems. The Muscovite core had been steadily expanding across the forest zone and the steppe, incorporating territories which the ruling elite assumed would eventually become fully integrated. Those territories had been conquered by force of arms, like Kazan and Bashkiria, or brought in by treaties, like Little Russia, where religion and an emerging society of landowners facilitated a growing accommodation. The Baltic provinces had also been acquired by force, and had no right to claim more than what the conqueror was willing to concede. But their societies were more pluralistic, and their “rights and privileges” formed a dense web of relationships more capable of resisting outside pressures. Moreover, they were part of a wider world of the Swedish empire, of German cities on the Baltic, and of Protestant Germany in general.\n\n34\n\nPart I: The Western Theatre\n\nSweden had pursued throughout the seventeenth century a policy of administrative centralization, which had created much resentment among the elites. For the Russians to do the same carried the risk of incurring the same resentment on the shores of an immense continent, with dangerous implications. Likewise, a policy of full integration was certain to ring many alarm bells throughout the Germanic world, with which the Russians wished to remain on friendly terms, in their own endeavour to gain hegemony in the Baltic sector of their western theatre. Such concerns dictated caution, and a policy of full integration would have to be tempered by the need to keep recognizing a special status for the provinces within the expanding core, in order to conciliate the wider world of which these provinces remained a part. Such a policy would not come until the second half of the nineteenth century when, characteristically enough, the German danger raised its head. It was in the field of territorial administration that integration became official policy from the beginning. Since the 1634 reform of the Swedish government, the Swedish kingdom, including Finland, had been divided into provinces (län). They included Estland, Livland, and Ösel Island; in Ingria, Noteborg, Kopore, Yamburg, and Narva; Karelia with Vyborg, and Kexholm, ceded by Russia in 1617, with a large Orthodox population soon forced to emigrate or convert to Lutheranism.33 When the annexation took place in 1710, the territorial reform of the expanding core had already divided it into eight provinces (gubernii) in December 1708. Narva was incorporated into Petersburg province, as well as Ingria under a separate administration. Estland, Livland, and Vyborg were later merged with it. When the second territorial reform took place in August 1719, which divided the provinces into provintsii, an enormous Petersburg province was made to consist of eleven provintsii, including Ingria, Vyborg, and Narva, as well as Pskov and Novgorod and their environs, even Tver and Yaroslavl. Estland was recognized as a separate province with Ösel Island; so was Livland, which had already become a province in 1713. Smolensk was added to it as the capital of a provintsiia, even though the two were not even contiguous.34 There was something incongruous in the long term about such territorial division, but it found its justification in current strategic considerations and the need to channel the largest amount of available resources toward the new capital. Petersburg became the capital not only of an expanding Russia but also of an immense region in need of an administrative infrastructure to link the various parts of what was essentially the basin of Lake Ladoga. But distances and the difficulty of maintaining communications convinced Peter’s successors of the need to concentrate agencies in smaller provinces. By 1727, Estland and Livland remained separate provinces, but the latter without Smolensk. A much smaller Petersburg province consisted only of Ingria, the Neva, and Karelia with Vyborg and Kexholm. The remainder, without Tver and Yaroslavl, became\n\nLaying the Foundations, 1650–1775 35\n\nNovgorod province, encompassing much of the old Novgorod territory reaching as far north as the White Sea. The only other change until the annexation of Finland in 1809 was the incorporation of additional territory in 1743. The new Russo-Finnish boundary followed the Kiumenne River from its mouth near Kotka across the Saupasselke ridges, swerved east and then north to include most of Lake Saimaa, and rejoined the 1721 border at Nyslott (Savonlinna). It was a strategic border which incorporated into the expanding core the entire Swedish defence perimeter running from Fredrikshamn (Hamina) past Villmanstrand (Lappenranta) to Nyslott. The enlarged Vyborg provintsia was transformed into a separate province. The newly annexed territory became Kiumenegorsk provintsiia of Vyborg province, its capital in Kexholm.35 The Swedish monarchy had long pursued a policy of full incorporation into the kingdom and total assimilation of the non-Swedish peoples. Its agents in the provinces were the governor (landshövding) with a small chancery. Baltic Germans usually filled the higher posts; the languages were Swedish and German. The governor was responsible for civil and fiscal affairs, even though the latter were often the responsibility of a separate Statthalter. Military affairs depended on a governor general. Finland was for long a distant backwater, cut off from Sweden during the winter months. In 1581 it was made a grand principality, and a governor general was first appointed in 1623. He resided in Åbo. It was not a permanent post at first, but became increasingly so during the reign of Charles XI. There was another in Reval, a third in "
