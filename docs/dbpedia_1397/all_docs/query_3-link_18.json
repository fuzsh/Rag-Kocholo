        "text": "Measurements differ from country to country. I used most common units for Asia (Singapore) which might not be so familiar for some western countries. Even though minor variations in measurements won’t affect your cooking, but it’s good if the recipe you like comes with measurements you are familiar with.\n\nAs a resident in Singapore, we use metric more than imperial measurement. I had a reader, Ms. Pauline Pogue aka Cheena Bukit, requested me to use imperial measurements for the benefit of US readers. I would very much like to do so, but to flow my measuring of ingredients using imperial units might be a challenge to me. What I did for imperial measurement readers here is, to have a unit converter added in my blog, you may always convert my metric measurement using the converter next to my posts. Alternately, check the conversion of units from metric to imperial listed as below, just for your reference:\n\nDry:\n\nmetric (grams) /imperial (ounces)\n\n30 g / 1 oz\n\n60 g / 2 oz\n\n90 g / 3 oz\n\n100 g / 3.5 oz\n\n125 g / 4 oz\n\n150 g / 5 oz\n\n185 g / 6 oz\n\n200 g / 7 oz\n\n250 g / 8 oz\n\n280 g / 9 0z\n\n315 g / 10 oz\n\n330 g / 11 oz\n\n370 g / 12 oz\n\n400 g / 13 oz\n\n440 g / 14 oz\n\n470 g / 15 oz\n\n500 g / 16 oz (1 lb)\n\n750 g / 24 oz (1.4 lb)\n\n1000 g / 32 oz (2 lb)\n\nLiquid:\n\nMetric (mililitres)/ Imperial (fluid ounces)\n\n30 ml / 1 fl oz\n\n60 ml / 2 fl oz\n\n90 ml / 3 fl oz\n\n100 ml / 3.5 fl oz\n\n125 ml / 4 fl oz\n\n150 ml / 5 fl oz\n\n190 ml / 6 fl oz\n\n250 ml / 8 fl oz (1 cup)\n\n300 ml / 10 fl oz\n\n500 ml / 16 fl oz (1 pint – US)\n\n600 ml / 20 fl oz (1 pint – UK)\n\n1000 ml (1 litre) / 32 fl oz (4 cups)\n\n1 teaspoon…… 5 ml\n\n1 tablespoon……20 ml\n\nSometimes, I use regular drinking cup to measure serving of cups. It’s OK, but getting a proper measurement cup does help a lot in cooking. Get yourself a few measurement cups in various sizes and units. Some indicate imperial (US or UK) units of measurements, while others indicate metric units.\n\nThose measurement cups which I got from NTUC Fairprice and Finest supermarkets cost about S$9 – 11 each. I spotted some cheaper ones in baking supplies shop, such as, Phoon Huat, where each sells at only S$3 – 4.\n\nVisited 49 times, 1 visit(s) today"
