That said, most games here in the USA seem to use inches. We've used a few rulesets that measure in cm, but those are few and far between. The only cm-based game that we regularly play that I can think off offhand is SBH, but that's simply the length of the measuring sticks the game uses. After they are made, no one thinks of them in terms of cm or inches.\n\nEven games in smaller scales such as Mech Attack, Alpha Strike, Panzer 8, and Full Thrust, use inches. IIRC, Future War Commander (a game from the UK we used to play) is a 6-15mm scale game that does use CM.\n\nAs for the availability of measurement tools, I've personally had no difficulty finding metric rulers and tape measures, even if I rarely have use for them.\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

I'd imagine that all the games developers at GW in the 80s would have been raised at home to use inches and then taught cm at school. Certainly the generation of historical war gamers before them in the 70s would have been a lot more comfortable with inches.\n\nThe Space Marine / EPIC game system was released a bit later than 40k, and the switch to cm could have happened merely because inches was found to be a bit too unwieldy for that scale.\n\nBATTLE REPORT ARCHIVE [/size]-- WEBSITE\n\nARMIES -- Chaos & Renegades -- Imperium & Arbites -- Tau\n\nSubject: Any backlash for using centimeters (or inches)?\n\nDrew_Riggio\n\nVersailles, France\n\nVertrucio wrote:\n\nAfter doing some googling, I found the odd fact that the UK still plays 40K and fantasy using inches, and that such measurements are more common than people would think.\n\nIn Europe, such as Spain or France, many measurements are converted to metric.\n\nIt depends.

All my tape measures have been dual imperial/metric. Imperial is more suited to everyday tasks, such as speed limits, food weights, beer and milk pints etc. It's easier to visualize a measurement when the scale of units is larger and the number smaller e.g. 12 stone vs 300 kg, 80mph vs 120kph, 1 pint vs 798 ml.
