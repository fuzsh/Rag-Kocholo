        "text": "Traditional system of measurement used in Vietnam\n\nVietnamese units of measurement (Vietnamese: hệ đo lường Việt Nam) are the largely decimal units of measurement traditionally used in Vietnam until metrication. The base unit of length is the thước (chữ Nôm: 𡱩; lit. \"ruler\") or xích (chữ Hán: 尺). Some of the traditional unit names have been repurposed for metric units, such as thước for the metre, while other traditional names remain in translations of imperial units, such as dặm Anh (English \"dặm\") for the mile.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally, many thước of varying lengths were in use in Vietnam, each used for different purposes. According to Hoàng Phê (1988),[1] the traditional system of units had at least two thước of different lengths before 1890,[2] the thước ta (lit. \"our ruler\") or thước mộc (\"wooden ruler\"), equal to 0.425 metres (1 ft 4.7 in), and the thước đo vải (\"ruler for measuring cloth\"), equal to 0.645 metres (2 ft 1.4 in). According to historian Nguyễn Đình Đầu,[3][4] the trường xích and điền xích were both equal to 0.4664 metres (1 ft 6.36 in), while according to Phan Thanh Hải,[5] there were three main thước: the thước đo vải, from 0.6 to 0.65 metres (2 ft 0 in to 2 ft 2 in); the thước đo đất (\"ruler for measuring land\"), at 0.47 metres (1 ft 7 in); and the thước mộc, from 0.28 to 0.5 metres (11 in to 1 ft 8 in).\n\nWith French colonization, Cochinchina converted to the metric system, the French standard, while Annam and Tonkin continued to use a thước đo đất or điền xích equal to 0.47 metres (1 ft 7 in). On June 2, 1897, Indochinese Governor-General Paul Doumer decreed that all the variations of thước (such as thước ta, thước mộc, and điền xích) would be unified at one thước ta to 0.40 metres (1 ft 4 in), effective January 1, 1898, in Tonkin. Annam retained the old standard for measuring land, so distance and area (such as sào) in Annam were 4.7/4 and (4.7/4)2 times the equivalent units in Tonkin, respectively.[6]\n\nLength\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists common units of length in Vietnam in the early 20th century, according to a United Nations Statistical Commission handbook:[7][8]\n\nEarly 20th-century units of length Name in chữ Quốc ngữ Hán/Nôm name[9][10] Traditional value Traditional conversion Modern value Modern conversion trượng 丈 4 m 2 ngũ = 10 thước ngũ 五 2 m 5 thước thước or xích 𡱩/尺 40 cm 10 tấc 1 m 10 tấc tấc 𡬷 4 cm 10 phân 10 cm 10 phân phân 分 4 mm 10 ly 1 cm 10 ly ly or li 釐 0.4 mm 10 hào 1 mm hào 毫 0.04 mm 10 ti ti 絲 4 μm 10 hốt hốt 忽 0.4 μm 10 vi vi 微 0.04 μm\n\nNotes:\n\nThe thước is also called thước ta to distinguish it from the metre (thước tây, lit. \"Western ruler\"). Other than for measuring length, the thước is also used for measuring land area (see below).\n\nAccording to the UN handbook,[7] some areas unofficially use 1 trượng = 4.7 metres (15 ft). According to Hoàng Phê (1988), the trượng has two definitions: 10 Chinese chi (about 3.33 m) or 4 thước mộc (about 1.70 m).\n\nThe tấc is also given as túc.[12] According to the UN handbook,[7] some areas unofficially use 1 tấc = 4.7 centimetres (1.9 in).\n\nMiscellaneous units:\n\nchai vai\n\n1 chai vai = 14.63 metres (48.0 ft)[13]\n\ndặm\n\nAccording to Hoàng Phê (1988), 1 dặm = 444.44 metres (1,458.1 ft). According to Vĩnh Cao and Nguyễn Phố (2001),[15] 1 dặm = 1 800 xích (Chinese chi) = 576 metres (1,890 ft)\n\nlý or lí\n\nAccording to Vĩnh Cao and Nguyễn Phố (2001),[15] there are two kinds of lý: 1 công lý = 1 km = 3 125 xích, while thị lý is a traditional unit equal to 1 562.55 xích.\n\nsải\n\nArea\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists common units of area in Vietnam in the early 20th century, according to the UN handbook:[7]\n\nEarly 20th-century units of area Name in chữ Quốc ngữ Hán/Nôm name[9] Traditional value Traditional conversion Dimensions Annamite value mẫu 畝 3 600 m2 10 sào 4 970 m2 sào 巢 360 m2 10 miếng 497 m2 miếng 36 m2 3 ngũ × 3 ngũ xích or thước 尺/𡱩 24 m2 10 tấc 33 m2 than 4 m2 1 ngũ × 1 ngũ tấc or thốn 𡬷/寸 2.4 m2 10 phân 3.313 5 m2 phân 0.24 m2 ô or ghế 0.16 m2 10 khấu 1 thước × 1 thước khấu 0.016 m2\n\nNotes:\n\nAnnamite units of area were (⁠4.7/4⁠)2 times those of other areas, due to units of length (trượng, tấc, etc.) being ⁠4.7/4⁠ times those of other areas, as explained above.\n\nAccording to the UN handbook,[7] the phân is also written phấn.\n\nThe sào is also given as cao.[16] Tonkin and Annam had different definitions of the sào.\n\nMiscellaneous units:\n\ncông or công đất\n\nThe công, used for surveying forested areas, typically in southwestern Vietnam, was equivalent to 1,000 square metres (11,000 sq ft).\n\ndặm vuông\n\nThe dặm vuông measures 1 dặm × 1 dặm.\n\nVolume\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists common units of volume in Vietnam in the early 20th century, according to the UN handbook[7] and Thiều Chửu:[9]\n\nEarly 20th-century units of volume Name in chữ Quốc ngữ Hán/Nôm name[9] Traditional value Traditional conversion Dimensions Notes hộc 斛 16 m3 10 lẻ 10 ngũ × 1 ngũ × 1 thước 1 hộc of unhusked rice ≈ 60 L miếng 14.4 m3 3 ngũ × 3 ngũ × 1 thước For buying and selling land lẻ or than 1.6 m3 1 ngũ × 1 ngũ × 1 thước 1 lẻ of husked rice ≈ 0.1 L thưng or thăng 2 L 1 000 sao đấu 1 L 2 bát = 5 cáp bát 0.5 L cáp 0.2 L 100 sao sao or (colloquially) nhắm[17] 抄 2 mL 10 toát Grain toát or (colloquially) nhón[17] 撮 0.2 mL Grain\n\nAdditionally:\n\n1 phương of husked rice = 13 thăng or 30 bát (bowls) in 1804[18]\n\n1 vuông of husked rice = 604 gr 50[19]\n\n1 phương or vuông or commonly giạ = 38.5 litres (8.5 imp gal; 10.2 US gal), though it is sometimes given as 1 phương = ½ hộc or about 30 L\n\nDuring French administration, 1 giạ was defined as 40 litres (8.8 imp gal; 11 US gal) for husked rice but only 20 litres (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 US gal) for some other goods.[20] It was commonly used for measuring rice and salt.\n\n1 túc = 3+1⁄3 microlitres (0.00020 cu in)[12]\n\n1 uyên = 1 litre (0.22 imp gal; 0.26 US gal)[21]\n\nThe following table lists units of volume in use during French administration in Cochinchina:[22]\n\nUnits of volume in Cochinchina Name in quốc ngữ Traditional conversion Traditional value Usage Weight hộc 26 thăng 71.905 L unhusked rice 1 tạ of unhusked rice = 68 kg[20] vuông 13 thăng 35.953 L, later 40 L husked rice thăng 2.766 L hiệp 0.1 thăng 0.276 L thược 0.01 thăng 0.0276 L\n\nNotes:\n\nUnhusked rice was measured in hộc while husked rice was measured in vuông because a hộc of unhusked rice becomes 1 vuông after husking.\n\n1 hộc of unhusked rice weighs 1 tạ.\n\nMiscellaneous units:\n\nthùng\n\nIn Cochinchina and Cambodia, 1 thùng (lit. \"bucket\") = 20 litres (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 US gal). The thùng is also given as tau.[23]\n\nWeight\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists common units of weight in Vietnam in the early 20th century:[24]\n\nEarly 20th-century units of weight Name in Chữ Quốc ngữ Hán/Nôm name[9][10] Traditional value Traditional conversion Modern value Modern conversion tấn 擯 604.5 kg 10 tạ 1 000 kg 10 tạ quân[17] 302.25 kg 5 tạ 500 kg obsolete tạ 榭 60.45 kg 10 yến 100 kg 10 yến bình[17] 30.225 kg 5 yến 50 kg obsolete yến 6.045 kg 10 cân 10 kg 10 cân cân 斤 604.5 g 16 lạng 1 kg 10 lạng nén 378 g 10 lạng lạng 兩 37.8 g 10 đồng 100 g đồng or tiền 錢 3.78 g 10 phân phân 分 0.38 g 10 ly ly or li 厘 37.8 mg 10 hào hào 毫 3.8 mg 10 ti ti 絲 0.4 mg 10 hốt hốt 忽 0.04 mg 10 vi vi 微 0.004 mg\n\nNotes:\n\nThe tấn in the context of ship capacity is equal to 2.8317 or 1.1327 cubic metres (100.00 or 40.00 cu ft).[25]\n\nThe cân (lit. \"scale\") is also called cân ta (\"our scale\") to distinguish it from the kilogram (cân tây, \"Western scale\").\n\nThe nén is also given in one source as 375 grams (13.2 oz),[25] but this value conflicts with the lạng from the same source at 37.8 grams (1.33 oz). The 375-gram value is consistent with the system of units for measuring precious metals.\n\nThe đồng is also called đồng cân, to distinguish it from monetary uses.[25]\n\nThe French colonial administration defined some additional units for use in trade: nén = 2 thoi = 10 đính = 10 lượng[17]\n\nUnits for measuring precious metals:\n\nThe lạng, also called cây or lượng, is equal to 10 chỉ. 1 cây = 37.50 grams (1.323 oz)\n\n1 chỉ = 3.75 grams (0.132 oz)\n\nMiscellaneous units:\n\nbinh\n\nThe binh was equivalent to 69 pounds (31 kg) in Annam.[26]\n\nTime\n\n[edit]\n\ncanh (更)\n\nThe canh or trống canh is equal to 2 hours (7,200 s).\n\ngiờ\n\nThe giờ, giờ đồng hồ, or tiếng đồng hồ is equal to 1 hour (3,600 s).\n\nCurrency\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditionally, the basic units of Vietnamese currency were quan (貫, quán), tiền, and đồng. One quan was 10 tiền, and one tiền was between 50 and 100 đồng, depending on the time period.\n\nFrom the reign of Emperor Trần Thái Tông onward, 1 tiền was 69 đồng in ordinary commercial transactions but 1 tiền was 70 đồng for official transactions.\n\nFrom the reign of Emperor Lê Lợi, 1 tiền was decreed to be 50 đồng.\n\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, beginning in 1528, coins were reduced from 24 millimetres (0.94 in) to 23 millimetres (0.91 in) in diameter and diluted with zinc and iron. The smaller coinage was called tiền gián or sử tiền, in contrast to the larger tiền quý (literally, \"valuable cash\") or cổ tiền. One quan tiền quý was equivalent to 600 đồng, while 1 quan tiền gián was only 360 đồng.[27]\n\nDuring the Later Lê dynasty, 1 tiền was 60 đồng; therefore, 600 đồng was 1 quan.\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Vietnamese traders at the border with China used the rate 1 tiền to 67 đồng.\n\nZinc coins began to appear in Dai Viet during the 18th century. One copper (đồng) coin was worth 3 zinc (kẽm) coins.\n\nBeginning with the reign of Emperor Gia Long, both copper and zinc coins were in use. Originally the two coins had equal value, but eventually a copper coin rose to double the worth of a zinc coin, then triple, then sixfold, until the reign of Emperor Thành Thái, it was worth ten times a zinc coin.\n\nUnder French colonial rule, Vietnam used the units hào, xu, chinh, and cắc. After independence, Vietnam used đồng, hào, and xu, with 1 đồng equaling 10 hào or 100 xu. After the Vietnam War, chronic inflation caused both subdivisions to fall out of use, leaving đồng as the only unit of currency. However, Overseas Vietnamese communities continue to use hào and xu to refer to the tenth and hundredth denominations, respectively, of a foreign currency, such as xu for the American cent.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHeavenly Stems & Earthly Branches\n\nUnits, Systems, & History of measurement\n\nChinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Japanese, Mongolian & Korean units of measurement"
