        "text": "Physicists throw world's smallest disco party with a levitating ball of fluorescent nanodiamond\n\nPhysicists at Purdue are throwing the world's smallest disco party. The disco ball itself is a fluorescent nanodiamond, which they have levitated and spun at incredibly high speeds. The fluorescent diamond emits and scatters ...\n\nExpansion of agricultural land threatens climate and biodiversity, land-use model finds\n\nBy 2030, global cultivation areas are expected to expand by 3.6%, increasing global agricultural production by 2%. This projection comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Organization ...\n\nModified solvents achieve vastly increased potentials for oxidation\n\nA team of scientists headed by Professor Ingo Krossing, Professor of Molecular and Coordination Chemistry at the University of Freiburg's Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, has succeeded in significantly increasing ...\n\nFirst map of vegetation across Antarctica reveals a battle for the continent's changing landscape\n\nA tiny seed is stuck between loose gravel and coarse sand. There is nothing else alive around it. All it can see is a wall of ice reaching 20 meters up into the sky. It is cold. Survival is hard around here. In winter, it ...\n\nSpectral measurements capable of estimating nutrient content of forest tree leaves\n\nThe general health of forests can be estimated by the micro- and macronutrient content of tree leaves to help inform forest management decisions in light of climate change, species loss and other variables. Traditional methods ...\n\nSea of opportunity: Protecting mangroves, seagrass could boost Indonesia's new climate targets\n\nIndonesia has signaled it could include blue carbon ecosystems—carbon-rich coastal and marine areas, like mangroves and seagrass—in its new climate targets. This shift follows years of relying heavily on the forestry ...\n\nResearchers identify seasonal sources of Beijing smog\n\nAn international study led by researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI has used a new method to identify the various sources of aerosols that create smog in Beijing.\n\nAntarctic survey of plant life to aid conservation efforts\n\nThe first continent-wide mapping study of plant life across Antarctica reveals growth in previously uncharted areas and is set to inform conservation measures across the region. The research is published in the journal Nature ...\n\nCoinfecting viruses obstruct each other's cell invasion\n\nThe process by which phages—viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria—enter cells has been studied for over 50 years. In a new study, researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Texas A&M ..."
