The light year is not accepted for use with the SI.\n\nOne light year is defined as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of one Julian year, 365.25 days, or 31 557 600 seconds.\n\nOne light year is equal to 9 460 730 472 580 800 m, or approximately 9.46 petametres. Definition c ΔνCs-1\n\nThe length in metres of one light year is calculated by multiplying the speed of light in vacuum, c, by the number of seconds in one Julian year:\n\nDefining constants\n\nThe metre is defined by the equation:\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum gives the definition for the distance travelled by light in one second. This distance is known as a light second.\n\nThe definition for the light year can then be obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation by 31 557 600, the number of seconds in a Julian year:\n\nAstronomy\n\nThe light year is used in the field of astronomy, primarily to express distances on interstellar and intergalactic scales.\n\nExamples of distances of stars from Earth\n\nName Distance in light years Distance in SI units Proxima Centauri 4.24 ly 40.1 Pm Barnard’s Star 5.96 ly 56.4 Pm Sirius 8.58 ly 81.2 Pm Tau Ceti 11.9 ly 112.5 Pm Altair 16.7 ly 158 Pm Vega 25 ly 237 Pm Arcturus 36.7 ly 347 Pm Aldebaran 65 ly 615 Pm Betelgeuse 548 ly 5187 Pm Rigel 860 ly 8136 Pm One light year is equal to approximately 9.46 petametres.\n\nExamples of distances of galaxies from Earth\n\nName Distance in millions of light years Distance in SI units Andromeda Galaxy (M31) 2.54 Mly 24.0 Zm Triangulum Galaxy (M33) 2.64 Mly 25.0 Zm Messier 83 (NGC 5236) 14.7 Mly 139 Zm Messier 63 (M63) 29.3 Mly 277 Zm Sombrero Galaxy (M104) 31.1 Mly 294 Zm Cartwheel Galaxy (PGC 2248) 500 Mly 4730 Zm One million light years is equal to approximately 9.46 zettametres.\n\nThe radius of the observable universe is approximately 440 000 zettametres, or 440 yottametres."
