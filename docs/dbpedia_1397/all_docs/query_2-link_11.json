        "text": "The Engineering Garage, located at 1960 Arthur St. on the northeast side of Belknap Campus, spans 7,500 square feet, serving as a dynamic makerspace dedicated to experiential education and hands-on learning across all engineering disciplines. This open environment offers students invaluable opportunities to gain practical experience beyond traditional classroom settings.\n\nWithin the garage, dedicated spaces are allocated for engineering competition teams, fostering collaboration and innovation. Additionally, a 1,200 square-foot machine shop equipped with training and essential equipment is readily accessible to all students, providing the tools necessary to bring their ideas to life.\n\nMore than just a physical space, the Engineering Garage serves as a hub where students from various engineering disciplines converge to collaborate on projects. Whether it’s class assignments, personal endeavors, or team-based competitions, this facility encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and empowers students to explore their passions and drive innovation forward.\n\nThe EG is adjacent to the Louisville Automation & Robotics Research Institute (LARRI) and GE’s FirstBuild.\n\nAn imposing shiny black granite sculpture entitled Integrity has stood vigil upon its foundation in front of the J.B. Speed School of Engineering building for the last 10 years. But for 95 years, since Speed School’s inception, the value of integrity has always been a rock-solid foundation for the engineers there.\n\nIn fact, ethics in engineering was the original inspiration for the late Bernie Dahlem, the Speed School alumnus who gifted the statue. According to Larry Tyler, Speed School Professor of Engineering Fundamentals, it was an editorial that sparked the idea that led to the sculpture’s fabrication.\n\nIn the Spring 2004 issue of the BENT, the magazine of Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society, then-Tau Beta Pi CEO Jim Froula, had written an editorial “A Matter of Ethics,” a topic that resonated with and caught the attention of alumnus Bernie Dahlem, who said he believed “integrity was sorely lacking in today’s world.” So moved by Froula’s words, Dahlem proposed the creation of a monument to then-Dean of Speed School Mickey Wilhelm to serve as a daily reminder for engineers to exercise integrity in their studies and future careers.\n\nThe sculpture Integrity is a physical fabrication of “The Bent,” designed after the trestle, the load-bearing part of a bridge, and represents the official emblem of Tau Beta Pi, and stands for the principle of integrity and excellence in engineering. The one-of-a-kind sculpture, completed and dedicated in 2009, was hand carved from Indian black granite, and measures more than six feet wide, eight feet tall, and weighs more than 21,000 lbs.\n\nEtched on the opposite side of the sculpture are words suggested by Bernie Dahlem from the Eligibility Code of Tau Beta Pi. Dahlem intended the words not only as a visible daily reminder, but to inspire graduating engineers as the last thing they will see as they walk down the steps of Speed School from academia into professional life. It reads:\n\nWe consider that integrity is the sine qua non for membership in Tau Beta Pi; that it transcends in importance scholarship, activity and every other qualification. Without private and public integrity, we believe that no organization is worthy of existence. Under integrity, we include honor and high standards of truth and justice.\n\nFrom Bernie Dahlem’s vision in 2014 to bringing the project to fruition took five years and a virtual “village” of engineers and related professionals. Geoffrey Atherton, an architectural designer with UofL’s Office of Planning, Design and Construction, designed the sculpture, with Cubist abstract influences in mind. An artist at heart, Atherton said he believes that engineering is art, and he was thrilled to play a creative role in the project. “Art is my passion and it was tremendously exciting for me. To have an opportunity to do something with my ideas for this was amazing,” he said.\n\nIn addition to the original vision of Dahlem and creative artistry of Atherton, J.P. Mohsen and Mark McGinley of the civil engineering faculty helped with the design work, and were aided by the valuable contributions of Tim Gornet, Joe Vicars and Damon Stacy from Additive Manufacturing Institute of Science and Technology (AMIST), who developed a 3-D model to better visualize and analyze the design.\n\nAfter considering numerous different materials, project leaders determined that granite was the most workable material for the statue and contacted Terry Fewell of Fewell Monument Co., in Scottsburg, Indiana.\n\nAtherton and Fewell worked with a group in India to get the granite cut and shipped. Fewell Monument assembled the piece in Scottsburg and then installed it, using a special ice process — that was itself a minor feat in engineering.\n\n“Because of the enormous weight of the art — 6.5 tons — it needed to be lowered very slowly into place so the pins and holes would line up,” explained Atherton.\n\nTo do this, Fewell Monument positioned the sculpture on a large piece of dry ice, which is frozen carbon dioxide. It doesn’t melt, but goes straight from solid form to gas, and as the dry ice turned to gas, the sculpture slowly lowered onto the base.\n\nThe teamwork of the entire sculpture project was paid for through donations, anchored by a large gift from Dahlem. Brasch-Barry General Contractors, which 1971 Speed grad John Brasch owns, donated and installed the brick sidewalk around the sculpture. Henderson Services, owned by 1973 Speed alumnus Bruce Henderson and 1969 UofL business graduate Rodney Henderson, donated the lighting.\n\n“The value of integrity is enmeshed in every part of the Speed School academic experience,” said current Speed School Dean Emmanuel Collins. “There could be no more fitting name and message for this monument that our students see every day,” he said.\n\nBernie Dahlem\n\nBernie Dahlem, who died in 2018, gifted more than $2 million to UofL Speed School over his lifetime. He obtained his BS in Civil Engineering In 1951, and MS in Civil Engineering in 1972 from UofL. He was a member of Board of Overseers and past president of Speed School Alumni Foundation. He received SS’s Professional Award for Engineering and was recognized for career accomplishment with the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1988, and was honored by UofL with an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1996. In 1994, he made a $1 million gift to Speed School to establish the Dr. John E. Heer, Jr. Faculty Scholar Fund. Bernie credited Dr. Heer for having a great influence on his life."
