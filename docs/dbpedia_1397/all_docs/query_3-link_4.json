This is interesting considering that 40K was created and based in England. Spelling is predominantly English not American in the rulebooks and novels. So why Imperial? E.g. A 6' x 4' battlefield etc. Only 3 countries in the entire world use Imperial.\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nBrainy Zoanthrope\n\n... Why have I not thought about this before? I've complained so much about 5th's LoS but I never once thought about this. Huh...\n\nIt could be because they know that Americans are basically the only ones who won't just suck it up and use the opposite system.\n\nWH40k is also pretty huge in America, and they need to appeal to their most stubborn audience. I personally like the metric system better because base 12 is stupid and we use base 10 for everything but time.\n\nTyranids - Main Army about 2000 pts Draconians, a BA successor chapter - around 1000 pts still calculating Other armies:\n\nDC:90SG+MB--I+Pw40k11+D+A++/fWD-R++T(Pic)DM+ [\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nHallowed Canoness\n\nIreland\n\nBecause it's called the Imperium of Man.

GW started with Imperial measurements so they stick with Imperial measurements. Otherwise they'd have to spend time reworking everything to Cm. Besides, 6\" movement is much cleaner sounding than \"15.24 centimeters\".\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

From what I understand all their road signs are still in miles as well. Apparently all their craftsmen such as carpenters etc still use the imperial system as well.\n\nThis is America, and England's special relationship, the rest of the world gets to deal with it.\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nDakka Veteran\n\nIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\n\nThe plural of codex is codexes.\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nSlippery Scout Biker\n\nBecause it is more simple in terms of tabletop gaming and better for the scale\n\nEven though I only use metric and hate imperial, I think imperial is great for tabletop games like 40K. I'd rather calculate distances with inches than centimeters, which are fairly tiny.\n\nWouldn't mind if 40K was in metric though.\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nThe Conquerer\n\nWaiting for my shill money from Spiral Arm Studios\n\nBFG uses metric. I think it works good for games with smaller increments.\n\nImperial may not be the best form of measurement, but it has the most in common with the first forms of measurement(body parts).\n\nAnd really, measurements only need to be standardized to be useful. If everyone on the planet used Imperial instead of Metric things would still work just fine. It would just be a little harder to convert units.\n\nSelf-proclaimed evil Cat-person.

That's coming from a resident and not a Wikipedia article.\n\nIf you ask someone their height and weight, they'll likely respond in Imperial and, yes, even if they are only young. Clothes are all measured in Imperial, so you'd buy trousers with a 32 inch waist. Pretty much anything to do with distance is Imperial. Road Signs are all imperial and our speed limits are in miles per hour and on a motorway, you're alerted to a junction by signs 300, 200 and 100 yards away from it. Beer and milk is still sold in pints, and cars tell you how efficient they are using miles to the gallon. And land is measured in acres/hectares.\n\nMetric is starting to creep in in some places, but back when Warhammer was conceived, there was even less metric - it was probably an obvious choice to use inches. And, from a practicality point of view, inches are bigger, so it's a lot easier and quicker to measure.\n\nDT:90S+++G++MB++IPwhfb06#+++D+A+++/eWD309R+T(T)DM+\n\n9th Age Fantasy Rules\n\nSubject: Re:Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nBrigadier General\n\nThe new Sick Man of Europe\n\nI think it's becuase imperial works better with dice-decided movements.\n\nDevastating Dark Reaper\n\nBecause when Games Workshop started we still had the emperical system in the UK and most people in this country were still more comfortable using that than metric system until the turn of the last century.\n\nDecrepit Dakkanaut\n\nVallejo, CA\n\nYeah, it's from England, and England doesn't use the metric system.\n\nEnglish people are generally fluent in metric units, but every English person knows their weight in stones and ounces, and drives their cars in miles per hour.

And to counter your assertion, I haven't got the foggiest idea what my weight is in imperial The exception is pounds as most food is sold by the pound (although quoted as the equivalent weight in grams).\n\n- Larger weights are easier as tons and tonnes are almost the same, you only need to specify which you're using for technical applications.\n\n- Long distances are in miles (speed limits are in MpH), although younger people will be perfectly happy to work in metres and kilometres.\n\n- Petrol is sold in gallons and everyone knows how much a pint is, but younger people can picture a litre much more easily and don't have any idea how a gallon or fl. oz. relates to pints.\n\nI've been brought up using metric, and I'm entirely happy with it. It's worth noting that where imperial measurements are still used in the UK, they're usually 'stand alone' measurements that don't require conversion up or down - for example with miles on roads you don't need to convert them to yards or cables using some crazy multiplier / divisor. The main exceptions are feet / inches (very easy) and stone / pounds / ounces, which is dying out.\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

I imagine other companies designing games these days stick with the Imperial measurements because Warhammer 40k being the most popular people are already used to the idea measuring in inches for tabletop games.\n\nDouble Fine Adventure, Wasteland 2, Nekro, Shadowrun Returns, Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, Planetary Annihilation, Project Eternity, Distance, Dreamfall Chapters, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Consortium, Divinity: Original Sin, Smart Guys, Raging Heroes - The Toughest Girls of the Galaxy, Armikrog, Massive Chalice, Satellite Reign, Cthulhu Wars, Warmachine: Tactics, Game Loading: Rise Of The Indies, Indie Statik, Awesomenauts: Starstorm, Cosmic Star Heroine, THE LONG DARK, The Mandate, Stasis, Hand of Fate, Upcycled Machined Dice, Legend of Grimrock: The Series, Unsung Story: Tale of the Guardians, Cyberpunk Soundtracks, Darkest Dungeon, Starcrawlers\n\nI have a KickStarter problem.\n\nSubject: Why Imperial and not Metric?\n\nDakka Veteran\n\nWell if your talking about the size of your manhood.
