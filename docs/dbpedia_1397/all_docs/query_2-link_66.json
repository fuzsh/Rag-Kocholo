        "text": "Eight Pueblos North of Santa Fe\n\nNAMBÉ PUEBLO\n\nNambe (Tewa)\n\n\"People Of The Round Earth\"\n\nNambé Pueblo history dates back to the 1300s, when it played a pivotal role as a center of culture and religion. Because of its importance as a social and economic hub, the Spanish conquerors that began arriving in the late 16th century tried to destroy it and nearly succeeded. Today, Nambé is known for traditional micaceous pottery, jewelry and sculpture and also for its beautiful location in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains where a spectacular double-drop waterfall, a lake, and a campground make up the popular Nambé Pueblo Recreation Area.\n\nThe Rio Nambé, whose headwaters begin high in the mountains and flows through the Pueblo, which is heavily forested in areas, and eventually feeds into the Rio Grande. The Pueblo has strong agricultural traditions, a buffalo range, and offers tours arranged in advance.\n\nAnnual events include a 4th of July weekend celebration at Nambé Falls, Easter Sunday Dances, October 3 (Evening Firelight Vespers), St. Francis de Assisi Annual Feast Day, October 4, and December 24 (Buffalo Dance Following Christmas Eve Mass).\n\nDirections and Contact Info\n\n18 miles north of Santa Fe, off U.S. 84/285 and N.M. 503\n\n(505) 455-2036\n\nwww.nambepueblo.org\n\nOHKAY OWINGEH\n\nFormerly San Juan Pueblo (Tewa)\n\n\"Place of the Strong People\"\n\nWhen Juan de Oñate established the first Spanish capital city in New Mexico in 1598, it was on the land of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, formerly San Juan Pueblo, where there stands a plaque to denote this today. Po'Pay, a medicine man who lived at Taos Pueblo when he led the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, was born at Ohkay Owingeh. The people of this Pueblo possessed such strength that only those born there could declare war for all the Pueblo Indians.Today, Ohkay Owingeh is home to San Juan Lakes, a popular fishing spot, the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council, and the Arts and Farmers Market where art from the eight northern pueblos is exhibited every Saturday, July-October. Pueblo artists primarily produce redware pottery, jewelry, painting, weaving, embroidery, and willow baskets. The Rio Grande runs through the Pueblo, which is surrounded by unusually tall trees. During the summer this is a very lush area.\n\nVisit the Native Arts of the Rio Grande Gallery & Cooperative where you can see and buy works from local Pueblo artists. Ohkay Owingeh also operates the Ohkay Casino, Resort and Hotel. Annual events include Ohkay Owingeh St. John's Feast Day with Comanche and Buffalo Dances held June 23-24, the famous Indian-Spanish hybrid Matachines Dance on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and the beloved Turtle Dance on December 25, which ushers in the new year for tribal members.\n\nDirections and Contact Info\n\nLocated 25 miles north of Santa Fe on U.S. 84/285 then five miles north of Espanola off N.M. 68.\n\n(505) 852-4400\n\nwww.ohkay.com\n\nPICURIS PUEBLO\n\nPinguiltha (Tiwa)\n\n“Mountain Warrior Place”\n\nWhen Spanish colonist Juan de Oñate encountered the residents of this Pueblo more than 400 years ago, he named the pueblo Pikuria, for \"those who paint.\" Artistic traditions still flourish at Picuris, which is famous for micaceous pottery. Picuris Pueblo is nestled on the banks of the Rio Pueblo River where it sits in a serene spot known locally as \"the hidden valley.\" Residents recently completed a major restoration by hand of their beautiful and historic 200-year-old adobe mission church, San Lorenzo de Picuris.

Due to drought conditions, they relocated to their current location near the Rio Grande and towering Black Mesa in the late 1500s or early 1600s—and it was from this mesa top that Pueblo residents fought Spanish solders during the Spanish re-conquest of New Mexico in 1694.\n\nSan Ildefonso is home to many well-known artists, including the late renowned potter Maria Martinez and her husband, Julian. They developed their famous black-on-black polished and matte pottery introduced to the world by Maria at the 1904 World Fair in St. Louis. Many potters continue to create the black-on-black and also red style. San Ildefonso today remains a major arts community where visitors can purchase work directly from artists' homes in this flourishing community.\n\nVisitors can explore the San Ildefonso Museum & Visitor Center and the Than Povi Fine Arts Gallery, formerly Cottonwood Trading Post, which feature crafts and fine art from major Native American artists, at affordable prices.
