Based on the correlation between the two τ's produced at a symmetric e^+e^- collider, the 3DIP method relies on the three-dimensional information from a double-sided vertex detector and on kinematic constraints for the precise measurement of the τ decay angles.\n\nThe lifetime of the Bs0 meson is measured in approximately 3 million hadronic Z decays accumulated using the ALEPH detector at LEP from 1991 to 1994. Seven different Ds− decay modes were reconstructed and combined with an opposite sign lepton as evidence of semileptonic Bs0 decays. Two hundred and eight Ds− ℓ+ candidates satisfy selection criteria designed to ensure precise proper time reconstruction and yield a measured Bs0 lifetime of τ (Bs0)= 1.59− 0.15+ 0.17 (stat)±0.03 (syst) ps."
