        "text": "Discussion\n\nWe found that CSF Aβ1-42 and amyloid PET imaging measurements were inversely associated in the majority of subjects, and that dichotomous classification was in substantial agreement. There was no evidence from cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses that abnormal CSF Aβ precedes abnormal florbetapir early in the course of disease.\n\nWe observed good agreement between CSF Aβ and amyloid PET measurements across several comparisons: with continuous or dichotomous forms of the variables, using cross-sectional and longitudinal CSF measurements, and across diagnostic groups. Overall, the association between CSF Aβ and florbetapir explains approximately 55% of the variance in these measurements, which is comparable to previous studies with PiB2–7. As expected, the proportion of subjects who were abnormal on both markers increased with severity of diagnosis, but the overall proportions of subjects who had concordant (both normal or both abnormal) and discordant Aβ measurements was stable across diagnostic groups (83–91% concordant, 9–17% discordant). In the longitudinal CSF sample, there was considerable change in CSF Aβ from the beginning to end of the followup period for some subjects, with most change occurring in a decreasing direction. Consistent with the cross-sectional sample, there was good agreement between the final CSF Aβ and the subsequent florbetapir measurement.\n\nOur data did not support the hypothesis that a decline in CSF Aβ precedes aggregation of fibrillar Aβ2, 8. In fact, among discordant subjects whose measurements were not close to the cutoffs, normal and EMCI subjects made up 100% of the CSF Aβ−/florbetapir+ group but only 29% of the CSF Aβ+/florbetapir− group ( ). Because active accumulation of amyloid is most likely to occur prior to the onset of significant cognitive decline22, 23, our findings support the possibility that fibrillar Aβ can be detected first in some individuals, which has been reported6, 10, or that there is a complex relationship between different species of Aβ and the progression of disease. For example, although decreasing CSF Aβ measurements in AD are generally thought to reflect the accumulation of soluble forms of Aβ in neuritic plaques 24, 25, this process may be altered by comorbid pathology or other etiologies that influence the production or clearance of different Aβ species. Specifically, low CSF Aβ in the absence of neuritic plaques has been reported in other disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Creuzfeldt-Jacob syndrome 26. Detection may play an important role as well; a recent case study reported low CSF Aβ in the presence of diffuse plaques detected at autopsy but not with PiB-PET imaging27. Although more longitudinal studies are needed, the existing evidence suggests that there may be considerable variability in the temporal dynamics and pattern of soluble and fibrillar Aβ.\n\nNonetheless, the combination of florbetapir and CSF marker information provided useful insight into diagnostic status for some subjects. For example, 3/22 subjects in the cross-sectional sample were diagnosed with AD at enrollment but were negative for both markers, indicating that their dementia is likely due to non-AD pathology. Similarly, in the longitudinal sample, 4/31 MCI subjects converted to AD during the followup period but were negative for both markers ( ; one was borderline positive for CSF Aβ). Misdiagnosis in AD patients with normal CSF Aβ and amyloid PET has been suggested previously28 and may account for some amyloid negative AD subjects in this study. Furthermore, comorbidities may have influenced the accuracy of the biomarker cutoffs themselves, and may account for inaccuracies in both clinical diagnoses and biomarker classifications. Of subjects who have come to autopsy, 5/9 ADNI MCI and AD subjects (not in this study) had comorbid pathologies such as alpha-synuclein pathology and tauopathy29. Furthermore, in a recent study of dementia patients that included individuals with comorbidities, the sensitivity and specificity of CSF biomarker measurements was lower for clinical compared with neuropathological diagnosis30, providing additional evidence that both misdiagnosis and non-AD pathology influence biomarker accuracy.\n\nThe longitudinal sample provided additional insight into the relationship between the two markers and the time course of the accumulation of amyloid pathology. While minimal longitudinal change in serial CSF Aβ measurements in normal or AD individuals has been reported previously1, 31, we observed a combination of stable trajectories and considerable variability and declines for some individuals. CSF Aβ trajectories were variable over time for those who were florbetapir negative at the end of followup, but there was minimal net change. Among those who were ultimately florbetapir positive, we observed several individuals whose CSF Aβ actively declined throughout the 5 to 6 year followup period to levels that were abnormal or close to abnormal, and this status was ultimately reflected by their abnormal florbetapir scan as well. We note that there is ambiguity about whether CSF Aβ became abnormal before florbetapir or vice versa due to the approximately one year delay between the final CSF measurement and the florbetapir scan; however, the downward trajectory of CSF measurement appears to be informative.\n\nOlder age in our sample may account for why we did not find evidence that CSF Aβ becomes abnormal prior to amyloid PET measurements. Previous cross-sectional PiB studies suggesting a possible offset in the time course of Aβ abnormality had subjects as young as 43 (and a mean age in the mid 60s)2, 8. Studies that did not report a pattern that was consistent with CSF Aβ becoming abnormal prior to amyloid PET had mean ages of approximately 6510 and 716, while the subjects in the current study had a mean age of 73. Since Aβ aggregation may begin earlier than 50 years of age32, our subjects may have passed a critical time period where the offset would be most clearly observed. Older age in our population may also explain why we did not find any evidence for an initial increase in CSF Aβ followed by a subsequent decline, although to our knowledge this has only been reported in autosomal dominant AD22, 33 and not in late-onset AD34.\n\nSeveral other methodological factors may have contributed to our findings. Although we had a large sample overall, the relatively small numbers of discordant subjects (particularly in the longitudinal sample) made it difficult to draw conclusions about the cause of the discordance. Disagreement between CSF Aβ and florbetapir measurements may have been due to measurement problems such as errors introduced by PET image processing, the use of cutoffs with differing sensitivities and specificities, and standardizing CSF assays to the same set of cutoffs. Establishing standardization across laboratories for LP collection and CSF assay analysis is a significant challenge that is currently being addressed18, 35. In addition, the cutoffs and distributions CSF Aβ and florbetapir differ in a way that influences the shape and linearity of their association. Both markers have an approximately bimodal distribution across the entire sample, but for florbetapir the broadest part of the distribution relative to the cutoff is in the abnormal range of values, whereas for CSF Aβ the broadest part of the distribution is in the normal range of values, resulting in a nonlinear inverse relationship when they are plotted against each other."
