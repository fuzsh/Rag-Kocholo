        "text": "Textiles weave through our everyday lives yet remain one of the most underexamined mediums in art history and contemporary practice. The universality of fabric has made it a potent messenger across global contexts – whether communicating personal stories or conveying hidden messages. Embedded in a single thread is the material history of the medium, revealing ideas relating to gender, labour, value, ecology, ancestral knowledge, and histories of oppression, extraction and trade.\n\nParticipating artists:\n\nPacita Abad (The Philippines), Magdalena Abakanowicz (Poland), Igshaan Adams (South Africa), Ghada Amer (Egypt/France), Arpilleristas (Chile), Mercedes Azpilicueta (Argentina), Yto Barrada (Morocco), Kevin Beasley (USA), Sanford Biggers (USA), Louise Bourgeois (France / USA), Diedrick Brackens (USA), Jagoda Buić (Croatia), Margarita Cabrera (Mexico / USA), Feliciano Centurión (Paraguay), Judy Chicago (USA), Myrlande Constant (Haiti), Cian Dayrit (The Philippines), Tracey Emin (UK), Jeffrey Gibson (USA), Antonio Jose Guzman and Iva Jankovic (The Netherlands / Panama and The Netherlands / Yugoslavia), Harmony Hammond (USA), Sheila Hicks (USA), Nicholas Hlobo (South Africa), Yee I-Lann (Malaysia), Kimsooja (South Korea), Acaye Kerunen (Uganda), José Leonilson (Brazil), Tau Lewis (Canada), Ibrahim Mahama (Ghana), Teresa Margolles (Mexico), Georgina Maxim (Zimbabwe), Małgorzata Mirga-Tas (Poland), Mrinalini Mukherjee (India), Violeta Parra (Chile), Solange Pessoa (Brazil), Loretta Pettway (Gee’s Bend) (USA), Antonio Pichillá (Guatemala), Faith Ringgold (USA), LJ Roberts (USA), Zamthingla Ruivah (India), Hannah Ryggen (Norway), Tschabalala Self (USA), Yinka Shonibare CBE RA (UK), Mounira Al Solh (Lebanon), Angela Su (Hong Kong), Lenore Tawney (USA), T. Vinoja (Sri Lanka), Cecilia Vicuña (Chile), Billie Zangewa (Malawi / South Africa), and Sarah Zapata (Peru / USA).\n\nOpening on 13 February 2024, Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art will shine a light on artists from the 1960s to today who have explored the transformative and subversive potential of textiles, harnessing the medium to ask charged questions about power: who holds it, and how can it be challenged and reclaimed? Spanning intimate hand-crafted pieces to large-scale sculptural installations, this major exhibition will bring together over 100 artworks by 50 international practitioners. Drawn to the tactile processes of stitching, weaving, braiding, beading and knotting, these artists have embraced fibre and thread to tell stories that challenge power structures, transgress boundaries and reimagine the world around them.\n\nOrganised thematically, with artists placed in intergenerational and transcultural dialogues, Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art considers the various ways in which artists have used textiles to speak to stories of marginalisation and exclusion, as well as emancipatory joy and transcendence. The show’s earliest works were created in the 1960s, when many artists were pushing the sculptural boundaries of the medium and challenging the limiting parameters of fine art and craft. Expanding across both time and geography, the exhibition will present six themes – Subversive Stitch, Fabric of Everyday Life, Borderlands, Bearing Witness, Wound and Repair and Ancestral Threads – which together explore the role of textiles in artistic practices that challenge dominant narratives, push up against regimes of power, and manifest an enduring spirit of hope.\n\nGuided by artworks that are radical in their form and their politics, the exhibition sets out to ask why textiles are a particularly resonant medium to address ideas of gender and sexuality, the movement and displacement of people, and histories of extraction and violence, as well as understanding the world through connecting with ancestral practices and communing with nature. The exhibited artworks encompass a wide range of forms, scales and techniques, drawing on historic forms of making as well as new and experimental processes.\n\nWorks on display include:\n\nEmbroidered blankets by Feliciano Centurión who – harnessing the association of textile as a gendered, feminine craft – embroidered poetic reflections onto found fabrics to process his HIV diagnosis in 1993.\n\nAn intimate installation of 64 items of clothing wrapped in unspooled yarn by Sheila Hicks, a leader of the fibre art movement in the 1960s whose work challenged the prevailing hierarchy between art and craft at the time.\n\nT. Vinoja’s delicately handstitched aerial landscapes inspired by testimonies from the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983-2009) that use the language of maps and borders to explore ideas such as loss, mourning and forced displacement.\n\nTwo tapestries and films by Teresa Margolles whose collaboratively-made, handstitched works commemorate the lives of individuals – Eric Garner in Staten Island and Jadeth Rosano López in Panama City – who were brutally killed. Each work was placed in contact with the body of the deceased, harnessing the ability of textiles to carry memory.\n\nHarmony Hammond’s large-scale work Bandaged Grid #9 in which cloths and rags are applied to the surface of reclaimed canvas to suggest bandages over seeping wounds, reflecting on the way artists have used textiles to express healing and reparation.\n\nYinka Shonibare CBE RA’s figurative sculpture Boy On A Globe which, using his signature Dutch Wax fabrics, addresses race, class and the legacy of imperialism by reflecting on colonial trade and the entangled economic histories embedded within fabrics.\n\nLarger-than-life, deity-like macramé sculptures by Mrinalini Mukherjee, which surge up from the ground as though organic beings. Drawing on nature and myriad artistic references, their knotted, rippling forms confound expectations of textiles as two-dimensional.\n\nCecilia Vicuña’s spatial installation Quipu Austral which, drawing on the history of textiles as ancient systems of communication, links the oppression of pre-colonial cultures to the devastation of the earth’s natural resources\n\nThis exhibition is co-curated by the Barbican, London and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, where it will be on show from 14 September 2024 to 5 January 2025."
