        "text": "All but three countries - Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States - have adopted the metric system as their primary system of measurement. Last year, Myanmar's Ministry of Commerce announced that Myanmar is switching to the metric system. That leaves me with the question... Why are Americans so stubbornly refusing to adopt the metric system?\n\nI was educated in both US units and metric units. I can switch between the two systems with little effort, and often speak in metric units - I use centimeters and millimeters (sorry, US spelling) rather than inches/fractions of an inch, milliliters and liters instead of fluid ounces and gallons, and grams/kilograms instead of ounces/pounds. Hell, I have my GPS set to give me distance in kilometers rather than miles! I found that the US system was rather difficult to learn while I understood the metric system instantaneously.\n\nThe metric system is easier to learn and undeniably better than US units. So... Why are Americans so stubborn? Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, which ultimately failed. As of now, politicians are not willing to try again (though there is a bill in Hawaii which, if passed, would mandate use of the metric system in Hawaii by 2018, but this seems unlikely to pass given how Americans are in general.)\n\nIt seems to me that the vast majority of Americans are simply too lazy to learn a new system of measurements/are used to US units/tradition bullshit. Issues with cost are also brought up, but I find that they focus solely on the up-front costs of metrication. We essentially have to work in metric units for trade, but we also have to use US units for the domestic market, which is really quite inefficient. It also led to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in September 1999. Expensive mistake there!\n\nThis PDF discusses this issue of inefficient use of two measurement systems and more. I'll bring the exact quote here:\n\n\"During conversion to the metric system, U.S. companies are able simultaneously to streamline their operations, eliminate inefficiencies, and reduce their inventories. Because products destined for\n\nboth foreign and domestic markets can be designed and manufactured to the same (metric) specifications, overlapping product lines can be eliminated. The standardization of fasteners, components, and sub-assemblies increases the efficiency and productivity of all manufacturing processes. When firms convert fully to the metric system, they are often surprised to discover how much the conversion has increased their profits. “Converted” firms frequently report finding new customers for their new metric products and services.\"\n\nSo, you're probably wondering, \"LucaroarkZ, why the hell are you making this thread?\" Well, I want to know a few things:\n\n-What are your views on America's refusal to adopt the metric system as its primary system of measurement?\n\n-If you are not from America, how did your country go about metrication? Was cost a major issue? Was opposition to metrication similar to opposition to metrication in America? Do you think America could go about metrication similarly to how your country did it? If not, how do you think they could do it, if at all?\n\n-If you are from America, what are your views on metrication? If the US were to mandate full metrication, how do you think they should go about doing so?\n\nSo I'm curious, why/how did you find the metric system easier to learn? To me, it's more of a perspective of whichever one you are exposed to and grow up around is the one you end up learning better; I take one look at the metric system and pretty much give up and use an internet calculator to try turning anything in it to something easier to read for me because I'm only exposed to US measurements on a daily basis. And while the US is the last industrialized country not using it, other countries like Britain still keep imperial units alive as well even if they're officially metric.\n\nDon't get me wrong, a universal system in general is probably better and would lead to less confusion/errors, and going into cooperation at an international level, they probably already use metric or at least try to communicate in it. But as for why it's not adopted in the US at large, the way I look at it anyways, that's still some billions or more dollars to covert everything to it (we're talking signage, education/books, reprograming computers and other technology that uses US measurements here, etc), not to mention the man hours as well to do it. And this is all for a \"benefit\" that most of the population in the US aren't going to ever see value in and don't care about to begin with since it's a boring math problem to many at worst for conversion. In a way, it's a \"if it's not broken, why fix it?\" kind of scenario here.\n\nSo I'm curious, why/how did you find the metric system easier to learn?

In a way, it's a \"if it's not broken, why fix it?\" kind of scenario here.\n\nWell in my case, I was learning both systems at the same time, so it's just that I grew up around both and found one easier to learn and understand. I just ended up preferring metric units, that's all.\n\nIt definitely does seem like most of the population doesn't see the value in metrication. I'm definitely looking at it more from a perspective regarding the benefits for industry/business and not really looking much at what it means for America as a whole. It's certainly not easy to learn a new system of measurement when you're used to one of them. Cost of changing signage and whatnot is an issue too; I think the estimated cost of changing signs from US units to metric is something like 400 million dollars? I need to find that article... Of course, if we decided to go metric, we could just do what Britain did and keep road signs in mph and miles instead of changing them to km/h and kilometers.\n\nBut your post does highlight some issues towards metrication in the US. The way I see it, the cost is a one-time issue and just using metric would be more beneficial in the long run. Then again, I grew up around the metric system, so I do have a hard time seeing it from the perspective of someone who grew up around the US system.\n\nAmericans? Gee, that's a lot of countries, two continents worth, after all... Most of them use the metric system, you know!\n\nNah, kidding, that's another thing that bothers me, but it's for another time.\n\nAs a Canadian, we're more or less sandwiched in as this weird bastard baby between the USA and Britain in the sense that both are actually used commonly and fairly interchangeably - though, yes, it's probably more because of the relations with Britain before metrication. Distance is measured in kilometres and metres [actually, it's measured by most in time, but I digress], and temperatures are measured in Celsius, but height and weight are measured in feet and pounds, and Canadian penises are Imperial penises, conquering vaginas the world over!\n\nMy bro [I summon kutsui in Attack Mode!] knows a great deal more about the subject than I, having lived in the US his entire life and having started a petition to get the US government to look at the subject again - though it did fail as most of these things do. As for it \"not killing people,\" vonFiedler, apparently it actually does, but hopefully my bro'll come back today or tomorrow to talk about that in more detail.\n\nThat said, I'll use the knowledge that I have about the perspective of your fabulous neighbours to the north.\n\nCanada's anglophone demographics are quite similar to those of the United States, in particular the western provinces [British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, maybe Manitoba], which can be especially noticed considering the west's lack of \"Canadian accents,\" as well as their more conservative tendencies [bar BC], with the Maritime provinces having their accents being comparatively strong overall, and the east generally electing more liberal-minded parties and politicians. My home province of Alberta has been [not wrongly] dubbed \"Canadian Texas\" as it's not only [I believe] the most conservative province, having elected conservatives into power for ~40 years in a row, a fairly large \"redneck\" population [Calgary's annual celebration is the Stampede, for Christ's sake], and because there were some stirrings of \"muh independence\" when the issue of whether the oil in Alberta belonged to the provincial or federal government. Anyway, because the demographics are very similar, among other reasons, US products are often delivered directly to Canada with little to no changes if they can allow for it. While metric labelling is required on food and such, other items like books and television shows aren't subject to this - books being a big reason why Imperial is huge in cooking, due to recipes being written in Imperial measurements. As for television shows... I always wondered why everyone in Spongebob paid only with twenty dollar bills.\n\nKeep in mind that this is more of a Western Canadian perspective, not having spent enough time in the East outside of family [my family there actually uses Fahrenheit, but they spend a lot of time in the states], and I'm not even going to attempt to speak for Quebec.\n\nCanada's generally been ahead in a lot of \"social issues\" in comparison to the US before; I'm not trying to brag, it's just true. Gay marriage, universal healthcare, freeing the slaves [though that was more the north in general], things like that - so, we essentially went through the bitchiness that they are/will be going through. Yes, Canadians bitched at the socialization of healthcare at first - Tommy Douglas [the guy who introduced it] was an unpopular guy before, and now he's a national hero. Yes, Canadians also bitched at the metrication process, \"Trudeau come West\" comics were apparently pretty popular - these comics involved the Prime Minister at the time [who pushed for metrication + official bilingualism] with a noose around his neck. He made third on the list, right behind a cool guy named Terry Fox who ran for cancer awareness.\n\nThat said, when the dust settled, did the country implode? Did all of our children spontaneously combust? Did Godzilla rise from the depths of the sea to squish the Quebecois? Sadly, no, all we got was a new official measurement system and some shitty t-shirt. Oh, and maybe some healthcare, too. Whatever.\n\nActually, they're probably only easy to remember because you grew up with them. There's nothing that intrinsically makes Imperial more easy to remember than Metric; quite contrary, as Imperial is based on arbitrary numbers, while Metric is based on neat groups of ten.\n\nDaylight savings time both kills and saves people. When people get more sleep, heart attacks are about 10% less common, while they are 10% more common when they lose that hour of sleep. This troubles health professionals due to making it even more clear that people need more sleep than they actually get, which is a shame. Sleep's fucking awesome."
