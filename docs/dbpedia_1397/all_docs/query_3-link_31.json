        "meta_description": "6-(fluoro-18F)-3-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)isoquinolin-5-amine ([18F]MK6240) has high affinity and selectivity for hyperphosphorylated tau and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. This study investigated whether the early phase of [18F]MK6240 can be used to provide a surrogate index of cerebral perfusion. Methods: Forty-nine subjects who were cognitively normal (CN), had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or had Alzheimer’s disease (AD) underwent paired dynamic [18F]MK6240 and [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET, as well as structural MRI to obtain anatomic information. Arterial blood samples were collected in a subset of 24 subjects for [18F]MK6240 scans to derive metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Regional time–activity curves were extracted using atlases available in the Montreal Neurologic Institute template space and using FreeSurfer. The early phase of brain time–activity curves was analyzed using a 1-tissue-compartment model to obtain a robust estimate of the rate of transfer from plasma to brain tissue, K 1 (mL⋅cm−3⋅min−1), and the simplified reference tissue model 2 was investigated for noninvasive estimation of the relative delivery rate, R 1 (unitless). A head-to-head comparison with R 1 derived from [11C]PiB scans was performed. Grouped differences in R 1 were evaluated among CN, MCI, and AD subjects. Results: Regional K 1 values suggested a relatively high extraction fraction. R 1 estimated noninvasively from simplified reference tissue model 2 agreed well with R 1 calculated indirectly from the blood-based compartment modeling ( r = 0.99; mean difference, 0.024 ± 0.027), suggesting that robust estimates were obtained. R 1 measurements obtained with [18F]MK6240 correlated strongly and overall agreed well with those obtained from [11C]PiB ( r = 0.93; mean difference, −0.001 ± 0.068). Statistically significant differences were observed in regional R 1 measurements among CN, MCI, and AD subjects, notably in the temporal and parietal cortices. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that the early phase of [18F]MK6240 images may be used to derive a useful index of cerebral perfusion. The early and late phases of a [18F]MK6240 dynamic acquisition may thus offer complementary information about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disease.",

        "text": "RESULTS\n\nParticipants\n\nSubject demographics are summarized in Table 1. All CN subjects (n = 25) had a Mini-Mental State Examination result of at least 25. Other participants met the National Institute of Aging research criteria for MCI or for AD dementia. Twenty-five subjects (8 CNs, 10 MCIs, and all 7 ADs) were amyloid-β–positive as defined by a distribution volume ratio of more than 1.2 calculated in a large cortical ROI that included the frontal, lateral temporal, and retrosplenial cortices (45). The CN and MCI/AD groups were well matched in age (68.7 ± 12.5 y vs. 69.8 ± 11.0 y, P = 0.7513; unpaired 2-sample t test). The time between [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans was variable between subjects: 29 subjects had their [11C]PiB and [18F]MK6240 scans performed within 2 wk of each other (18 of which had them on the same day), and for the remaining subjects the 2 scans were separated by up to several months. Thirty-five subjects had their [11C]PiB scan performed before their [18F]MK6240 scan, and the remaining subjects had their [18F]MK6240 scan performed first.\n\nBlood-Based Compartmental Analysis\n\nThe K1 estimates obtained from the 1T2kv model were stable while using 5 or 10 min of data, indicating the robustness of these measurements and thus demonstrating that the estimation of K1 is sufficiently decoupled from the estimation of the parameter k2. The total-least-square regression and Bland–Altman plots demonstrated a good correlation and agreement, respectively (y = 1.02x − 0.01, r = 0.99, P < 0.0001; mean difference, 0.000 ± 0.009 mL⋅cm−3⋅min−1; P = 0.9521) and also highlight the relatively broad range of K1 values measured across subjects and brain regions (Supplemental Fig. 1). Similar levels of correlation and agreement were observed when comparing corresponding R1 estimates (y = 1.01x − 0.01, r = 0.99, P < 0.0001; mean difference, −0.004 ± 0.019; P = 0.8026). On average, cerebellar K1 values were lower in the MCI/AD group than in the CN group (0.326 ± 0.066 mL⋅cm−3⋅min−1 vs. 0.391 ± 0.094 mL⋅cm−3⋅min−1); however, these differences were not statistically significant as assessed by a 2-tailed unpaired t test (P = 0.0767).\n\nSimulations at Different Levels of Specific Binding\n\nSupplemental Table 1 shows the results of the simulation study performed for 3 different R1 values (0.4, 0.85, and 1.3) at increasing levels of specific binding in the target region as indicated by the simulated range of distribution volume ratios. When only the first 5 min of simulated time–activity curves were fitted, the bias in the estimated K1 and corresponding R1 in the target region was well below 2% for all levels of specific binding. When the first 10 min of time–activity curves were fitted, the bias in K1 and R1 estimates in the target region increased with the level of specific binding and was higher for larger simulated values of R1 (−7.06% and −6.12%, respectively, at R1 = 1.3). The measured bias on estimated K1 in the reference region was 0.04% and 1% when using 5 min and 10 min of data, respectively.\n\nReference Region Model-Based Analysis\n\nDirect estimates of R1 obtained from SRTM2 showed a strong correlation and good agreement (y = 0.95x + 0.07, r = 0.99, P < 0.0001; mean difference, 0.024 ± 0.027; P = 0.1261) with those obtained indirectly from the blood-based compartmental analysis using the first 5 min of PET data for each method (Fig. 1). The mean subject-specific median value across subjects was 0.084 ± 0.049 min−1 (range, 0.022–0.270 min−1). Fixing to a population-based value determined from SRTM ( ) had a negligible effect on R1 estimates in comparison to using subject-specific median values (mean difference across all subjects and brain regions, −0.06% ± 0.40%). Likewise, fixing to blood-based (the average cerebellar blood-based estimates, with blood-based = 0.062 ± 0.014 min−1 and range = 0.040–0.088 min−1) led to similar R1 estimates in comparison to using subject-specific median values (mean difference across all subjects and brain regions, −0.08% ± 0.33%). Therefore, for all SRTM2 analyses performed with [18F]MK6240 in this work, we used . The SRTM2 R1 estimates were also stable when using 10 min of data compared with using only 5 min (y = 1.00x − 0.02, r = 0.99, P < 0.0001; mean difference, −0.013 ± 0.019; P = 0.2522).\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison Between R1 Estimates Obtained from [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB\n\nFigure 2 shows a direct comparison between R1 estimates obtained from [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans. When all 49 paired scans were included in the analysis, the overall correlation and agreement were good despite some variability (Figs. 2A and 2B: y = 0.97x + 0.03, r = 0.93, P < 0.0001; mean difference, −0.001 ± 0.068; P = 0.9242). When the analysis was restricted to pairs of [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans acquired within 2 wk, the correlation and agreement were slightly better (Figs. 2C and 2D: y = 0.99x + 0.00, r = 0.95, P < 0.0001; mean difference, −0.003 ± 0.059; P = 0.8623), possibly reflecting daily variations in CBF. Restricting the analysis to pairs of scans acquired the same day further reduced the variability (Figs. 2E and 2F: y = 0.99x + 0.00, r = 0.97, P < 0.0001; mean difference, −0.010 ± 0.043; P = 0.6273).\n\nRegional differences in R1 estimates obtained from [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans for the FreeSurfer analysis are presented in Supplemental Table 2. After Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, none of the observed differences were statistically significant when grouping all subjects together or when considering CN subjects only. In the MCI/AD group, only differences in the inferior temporal cortex survived the Bonferroni adjustment. Overall, these results demonstrate that similar R1 estimates were obtained from [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans.\n\nRegional Analysis of R1 Among Groups\n\nFigure 3 shows the average regional R1 values measured in each group for regions of interest derived from the FreeSurfer parcellation. All P values for regional comparisons can be found in Supplemental Table 3. Figure 3A shows bar plots with CN, MCI, and AD groups presented separately. When MCI and CN subjects or MCI and AD subjects were compared, none of the measured differences that were below a P value of 0.05 survived Bonferroni adjustment. When AD and CN subjects were compared, only the inferior-temporal cortex, middle-temporal cortex, and inferior-parietal cortex were still statistically significant after Bonferroni adjustment. Finally, when MCI and AD subjects were grouped and compared with CN subjects, only differences in the middle-temporal cortex survived Bonferroni adjustment (Fig. 3B).\n\nParametric Imaging\n\nFigure 4 shows parametric images of R1 computed with SRTM2 using 10 min of dynamic data, along with the structural MRI for anatomic reference, the [11C]PiB distribution volume ratio images showing amyloid burden, and the late [18F]MK6240 SUV ratio for images from 90 to 120 min showing tau pathology. The figure shows a side-by-side comparison between a CN subject and a subject with AD of similar age. Although the CN subject showed relatively homogeneous perfusion in the cortical and subcortical areas, the AD subject showed marked hypoperfusion in the temporal and parietal cortices, which were also areas showing tau pathology. Group-average images of [18F]MK6240 R1 are shown in Figure 5. Visually, a reduction in R1 was apparent on the AD-average images as compared with CN and MCI subjects.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we investigated the use of early-phase [18F]MK6240 dynamic images to derive an index of relative perfusion by tracer kinetic modeling. We chose to fit only the first few minutes of PET measurements since this early phase after tracer injection is the most sensitive part of the scan to changes in perfusion. Mathematically, this can be demonstrated by plotting the sensitivity curves of the model parameters (Supplemental Fig. 2). Our simulation results demonstrated that fitting the first 5 min of PET data with a simple 1-tissue-compartment model provided K1 and R1 estimates within 2% of ground truth, suggesting that neglecting specific binding does not introduce noticeable bias or variability. Using 10 min of data, however, resulted in a slightly higher bias that increased with increasing level of specific binding (i.e., increasing distribution volume ratios) and with simulated R1 values. Nevertheless, we generated R1 parametric images using 10 min of data because the quality of the parametric maps was higher than when using only 5 min after tracer injection (Supplemental Fig. 3), thus accepting a tradeoff between bias and image quality. Overall, our findings from simulations and experimental data suggest that [18F]MK6240 can provide robust surrogate measurements of relative perfusion. We found good agreement between direct estimates of R1 obtained by SRTM2 and indirect R1 estimates from blood-based compartment modeling, as well as good agreement between [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB R1 estimates.\n\nQuantitative measurements of perfusion derived from the early phase of [11C]PiB have previously been compared with the gold standard, [15O]H2O, by several investigators who reported relatively high values of the K1 rate constant and subsequently proposed that [11C]PiB might also be used to deduce changes in blood flow (17,18,46). Gjedde et al. previously presented evidence that the early phase of [11C]PiB is not completely flow-limited, with significant but not unlimited permeability, and reported an average extraction fraction of 0.53 by comparing K1 with CBF as measured by [15O]H2O in different brain regions of AD and CN subjects (17). Subsequent work by Chen et al. reported that R1 derived from SRTM2 correlated strongly with regional relative [15O]H2O CBF measurements (18), and more recently, Heeman et al. demonstrated excellent test–retest reproducibility of R1 measurement with [11C]PiB, suggesting suitability for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (47). Of note, the regional K1 estimates and dynamic range of values measured in CN subjects in the present work with [18F]MK6240 were about 20%–25% higher than those previously reported for [11C]PiB in healthy volunteers of comparable age (18), suggesting that [18F]MK6240 may possess a higher extraction fraction and therefore may be more sensitive to changes in CBF—although data were acquired on different scanners, using different reconstruction algorithms and different brain atlases for time–activity curve extraction, thus precluding a definitive conclusion. When we normalized by the gray cerebellum, R1 values derived by [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans were similar, suggesting comparability of R1 measurements between these 2 tracers for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. In light of these findings and previous work with [11C]PiB, future studies including head-to-head comparisons between [18F]MK6240 and [15O]H2O with arterial blood sampling would be necessary to determine the extraction fraction of [18F]MK6240 and to evaluate its actual sensitivity to small changes in CBF by direct comparison of regional K1 values between the 2 tracers and across CN, MCI, and AD subjects.\n\nIn the present work, we performed a group comparison of R1 among CN, MCI, and AD subjects using regions of interest derived from the parcellation provided by FreeSurfer. The differences between groups were generally consistent with perfusion deficits generally reported by previous work using reference techniques (6), although some discrepancies exist in the literature possibly due to differences in methodology and cohorts across studies.\n\nAlthough a full 120-min dynamic PET acquisition is ideal for providing fully quantitative measurements of tau pathology and indices of cerebral perfusion by tracer kinetic modeling, such a long dynamic scanning protocol is impractical in a clinical setting and typically results in patient discomfort and reduced scanning efficiency compared with shorter static scans. To address this limitation, and similarly to what was previously proposed for amyloid imaging (48), Kolinger et al. recently proposed a dual-time-window acquisition protocol for accurate quantitative measurements of longitudinal changes in tau load for [18F]MK6240 studies (49). Such a protocol would be particularly suited to allow for both quantification of tau pathology—either using kinetic analysis to derive a quantitative distribution volume ratio or using a semiquantitative late SUV ratio—and derivation of an index of cerebral perfusion such as proposed in the current study.\n\nOne of the limitations of the present work is the relatively small sample size for the AD group. For this reason, in our group analyses we also presented results grouping MCI and AD subjects and comparing them with CN subjects. Our data were also acquired on 2 different systems. Although both scanners possess a similar intrinsic spatial resolution (2) and were calibrated and validated for absolute quantification, no further efforts were made to specifically harmonize the 2 scanners to each other. However, for each participant, paired [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB scans were performed on the same scanner and reconstructed with the same reconstruction algorithm; therefore, our results comparing the R1 for [18F]MK6240 and [11C]PiB should be largely unaffected by the type of scanner. Another limitation relates to the use of a reference tissue model for deriving R1. Although reference region techniques present the advantage of being noninvasive, that is, not requiring arterial cannulation and blood sampling, they provide a measure of only relative perfusion and cannot capture global changes in perfusion. In the present work, we used the gray cerebellum as a reference region, and although we did not find statistically significant differences in cerebellar K1 at the group level among CN, MCI, and AD subjects, there were nonetheless some differences among subjects. Consequently, after normalization by cerebellar K1, some group differences between the CN and MCI/AD groups that were due to global changes in perfusion (as observed in Supplemental Figs. 1A and 1B) were not apparent in R1 estimates (Supplemental Figs. 1C and 1D). This is, however, consistent with the observation from previous studies that AD is associated with both global and regional cerebral hypoperfusion (6)."
