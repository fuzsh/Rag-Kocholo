        "text": "AnthropologyÂ is the study of the origin and development of human societies and cultures.Â CultureÂ is the learned behavior of people, including their languages, belief systems, social structures, institutions, and material goods. Anthropologists study theÂ characteristics of past and present human communities through a variety of techniques. In doing so, they investigate and describe how different peoples of our world lived throughout history.\n\nAnthropologists aim to study and present their human subjects in a clear and unbiased way. They attempt to achieve this by observing subjects in their local environment. Anthropologists then describe interactions and customs, a process known asÂ ethnography. By participating in the everyday life of their subjects, anthropologists can better understand and explain the purpose of local institutions, culture, and practices. This process is known asÂ participant-observation.\n\nAs anthropologists study societies and cultures different from their own, they must evaluate their interpretations to make sure they arenât biased. ThisÂ biasÂ is known asÂ ethnocentrism, or the habit of viewing all groups as inferior to another, usually their own, cultural group.\n\nTaken as a whole, these steps enable anthropologists to describe people through the people's own terms.\n\nSubdisciplines of Anthropology\n\nAnthropologyâs diverse topics of study are generally categorized in four subdisciplines. AÂ subdisciplineÂ is a specialized field of study within a broader subject or discipline. Anthropologists specialize in cultural or social anthropology,Â linguistic anthropology, biological or physical anthropology, and archaeology. While subdisciplines can overlap and are not always seen byÂ scholars asÂ distinct, each tends to use different techniques and methods.\n\nCultural Anthropology\n\nCultural anthropology, also known as social anthropology, is the study of the learned behavior of groups of people in specific environments. Cultural anthropologists base their work in ethnography, a research method that usesÂ field workÂ and participant-observation to study individual cultures and customs.\n\nElizabeth Kapu'uwailani Lindsey is a National Geographic Fellow in anthropology. As a doctoral student, she documented rare and nearly lost traditions of theÂ palu, Micronesian navigators who donât use maps or instruments. Among the traditions she studied were the chants and practices of the Satawalese, a tiny cultural group native to a single coralÂ atollÂ in the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nCultural anthropologists who analyze and compare different cultures are known as ethnologists. Ethnologists may observe how specific customs develop differently in different cultures and interpret why these differences exist.\n\nNational Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Wade Davis is an ethnobotanist. He spent more than three years in Latin America, collecting and studying plants that different indigenous groups use in their daily lives. His work compares how these groups understand and use plants as food, medicine, and in religious ceremonies.\n\nLinguistic Anthropology\n\nLinguistic anthropologyÂ is the study of how language influences social life. Linguistic anthropologists say language provides people with the intellectual tools for thinking and acting in the world. Linguistic anthropologists focus on how language shapes societies and their social networks, cultural beliefs, and understanding of themselves and their environments.\n\nTo understand how people use language for social and cultural purposes, linguistic anthropologists closely document what people say as they engage in daily social activities. This documentation relies on participant-observation and other methods, including audiovisual recording and interviews with participants.\n\nLera Boroditsky, aÂ cognitive scientist, studies forms of communication among the Pormpuraaw, an Aboriginal community in Australia. Boroditsky found that almost all daily activities and conversations were placed within the context ofÂ cardinal directions. For example, when greeting someone in Pormpuraaw, one asks, âWhere are you going?â A response may be: âA long way to the south-southwest.â A person might warn another, âThere is a snake near your northwest foot.â This language enables the Pormpuraaw to locate and navigate themselves in landscapes with extreme precision, but makes communication nearly impossible for those without an absolute knowledge of cardinal directions.\n\nLinguistic anthropologists may document native languages that are in danger ofÂ extinction. The Enduring Voices Project at National Geographic aimed to prevent language extinction by embarking on expeditions that create textual, visual, and auditory records of threatened languages. The project also assisted indigenous communities in their efforts to revitalize and maintain their languages. Enduring Voices has documented the Chipaya language of Bolivia, the Yshyr Chamacoco language of Paraguay, and the Matugar Panau language of Papua New Guinea, among many others.\n\nBiological Anthropology\n\nBiological anthropology, also known as physical anthropology, is the study of theÂ evolutionÂ of human beings and their living andÂ fossilÂ relatives. Biological anthropology places human evolution within the context of human culture and behavior. This means biological anthropologists look at how physical developments, such as changes in our skeletal or genetic makeup, are interconnected with social and cultural behaviors throughout history.\n\nTo understand how humans evolved from earlier life forms, some biological anthropologists studyÂ primates, such as monkeys and apes. Primates are considered our closest living relatives. Analyzing the similarities and differences between human beings and the âgreat apesâ helps biological anthropologists understand human evolution.\n\nJane Goodall, a primatologist, has studied wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Tanzania for more than 40 years. By living with these primates for extended periods of time, Goodall discovered a number of similarities between humans and chimpanzees.\n\nOne of the most notable of Goodallâs discoveries was that chimpanzees use basic tools, such as sticks. Toolmaking is considered a key juncture in human evolution. Biological anthropologists link the evolution of the human hand, with a longer thumb and stronger gripping muscles, to our ancient ancestorsâ focus on toolmaking.\n\nOther biological anthropologists examine the skeletal remains of our human ancestors to see how we have adapted to different physical environments and social structures over time. This specialty is known as human paleontology, orÂ paleoanthropology.\n\nZeresenay Alemseged, a National Geographic Explorer, examinesÂ hominidÂ fossils found at the Busidima-Dikika anthropological site in Ethiopia. Alemsegedâs work aims to prove that a wide diversity of early hominid species existed three million to four million years ago. Paleoanthropologists study why some hominid species were able to survive for thousands of years, while others were not.\n\nBiological anthropology may focus on how the biological characteristics of living people are related to their social or cultural practices. The Ju/âhoansi, a foraging society of Namibia, for example, have developed unique physical characteristics in response to cold weather and a lack of high-calorie foods. A thick layer of fat protects vital organs of the chest and abdomen, and veins shrink at night. This reduces the Ju/âhoansiâs heat loss and keeps their core body temperature at normal levels.\n\nArchaeology\n\nArchaeologyÂ is the study of the human past using material remains. These remains can be any objects that people created, modified, or used. Archaeologists carefully uncover and examine these objects in order to interpret the experiences and activities of peoples andÂ civilizations throughout history.\n\nArchaeologists often focus their work on a specific period of history. Archaeologists may studyÂ prehistoricÂ culturesâcultures that existed before the invention of writing. These studies are important because reconstructing a prehistoric cultureâs way of life can only be done through interpreting theÂ artifacts they left behind. For example, macaw eggshells, skeletal remains, and ceramic imagery recovered at archaeological sites in the United States Southwest suggest the important role macaws played as exotic trade items and objects of worship for prehistoric peoples in that area.\n\nOther archaeologists may focus their studies on a specific culture or aspect of cultural life. Constanza Ceruti, a National Geographic Emerging Explorer, is a high-altitude archaeologist specializing in artifacts and features of the Incan Empire. Along with archaeological evidence, Ceruti analyzes historical sources and traditional Andean beliefs. These data help her reconstruct what ancient sites looked like, the symbolic meaning behind each artifact, and how ceremonies took place.\n\nHistory of Anthropology\n\nThroughout history, the study of anthropology has reflected our evolving relationships with other people and cultures. These relationships are deeply connected to political,Â economic, and social forces present at different points in history.\n\nThe study of history was an important aspect of ancient Greek and Roman cultures, which focused on using reason andÂ inquiryÂ to understand and create just societies.Â Herodotus, a Greek historian, traveled through regions as far-flung as present-day Libya, Ukraine, Egypt, and Syria during the fifth century B.C.E. Herodotus traveled to these places to understand the origins of conflict between Greeks and Persians. Along with historical accounts, Herodotus described the customs and social structures of the peoples he visited. These detailed observations are considered one of the worldâs first exercises in ethnography.\n\nThe establishment of exchange routes was also an important development in expanding an interest in societies and cultures. Zhang Qian was a diplomat who negotiated trade agreements and treaties between China and communities throughout Central Asia, for instance. ZhangâsÂ diplomacyÂ and interest in Central Asia helped spur the development of theÂ Silk Road, one of historyâs greatest networks for trade, communication, and exchange. The Silk Road provided a vital link between Asia, East Africa, and Eastern Europe for thousands of years.\n\nMedieval scholars and explorers, who traveled the world to develop new trading partnerships, continued to keep accounts of cultures they encountered. Marco Polo, a VenetianÂ merchant, wrote the first detailed descriptions of Central Asia and China, where he traveled for 24 years. Poloâs writings greatly elaborated Europeâs early understandings of Asia, its peoples, and practices.\n\nIbn Battuta traveled much more extensively than Marco Polo. Battuta was a Moroccan scholar who regularly traveled throughout North Africa and the Middle East. His expeditions, as far east as India and China, and as far south as Kenya, are recorded in his memoir, theÂ Rihla."
