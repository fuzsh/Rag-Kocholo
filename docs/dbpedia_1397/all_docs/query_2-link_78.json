It is situated near the tip of an 11-mile- (18-km-) long projection into the South China Sea, which trends southwest and partially encloses Ganh Rai Bay. The bay receives the Saigon River on the northeastern Mekong River delta. The port of Vung Tau has a pilot station, fuel depot, and sea harbour to serve vessels using the port of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), 45 miles (72 km) up the Soirap River. It also has a government training centre for rural workers. The port was traditionally a seaside resort with several hotels. On one of the granite hills overlooking the port is a well-known shrine to the Buddha. Pop. (1999) 196,754; (2009) 282,415."
