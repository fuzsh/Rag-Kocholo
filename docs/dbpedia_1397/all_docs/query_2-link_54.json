        "text": "Tarek Atoui (b. 1980, Beirut) is a composer and sound artist who works with innovative electroacoustic instruments. These are activated as part of installations to explore different methods of listening, composition, and performance. Atoui often develops projects over many years within different cultural contexts, and with a vast range of collaborators. Sound is translated into energy, light and electricity, becoming an agent to play the instruments, inviting performers and audiences to tune into the spaces and the listening possibilities they offer.\n\nFor Yorkshire Sculpture International, Atoui will present The Shuffle Orchestra, a series of performances in which the artist will activate instruments newly made by a growing international network of instrument-makers. Each performance will focus on the work of one of Atouiâ€™s close collaborators, and will involve people, artists and members of the sound community across Leeds and Wakefield. The first public performance will be held at Wakefield Cathedral on Sat 20 July. Click here to book."
