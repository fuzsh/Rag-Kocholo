        "text": "Originally formulated to assess the stability of oscillators in atomic clocks, Allan variance provides a robust measure of frequency stability over varying timescales, which statistics such as standard deviation do not take into account. In this white paper, we review the mathematical foundation of Allan variance, and share how Allan variance and its related quantities serve as helpful tools for the precise analysis of time series data in practical applications such as oscillator characterization.\n\nAllan variance can be performed using the Moku, an FPGA-based device that houses a reconfigurable suite of test and measurement instruments. Leveraging the unique Phasemeter instrument, one can record ultra-precise phase, frequency, and amplitude data of an incoming periodic signal, as well as calculate and plot statistics such as Allan variance in real time.\n\nA brief history of Allan variance\n\nHow stable is your system? There are many tools available to answer this question. In the 1960s, while working on optical clocks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (then known as the National Bureau of Standards), David W. Allan invented a new one [1].\n\nAllan found that existing statistical measures such as standard deviation diverged for particular noise sources as the number of samples increased. This motivated him to develop a new time-domain metric, which today bears his name.\n\nAs Allan was then working on optical clocks, Allan variance was developed for the field of atomic frequency standards. As a result, discussion of the topic is often relegated to the vernacular of the field, especially with regard to characterizing the frequency stability of an oscillator.\n\nHowever, Allan variance can be computed for any time series. This series could represent the signal itself, such as the output of a temperature sensor, or any of its properties (frequency, phase, amplitude etc.), evaluated at a constant rate. As a result, Allan variance has found favor in diverse applications from communications [2] to navigation [3].\n\nThe Moku Phasemeter instrument offers Allan variance as one of the available post-processing options, shown on the Moku:Pro in Figure 1 below. This note provides a primer on the statistic aimed at users encountering it for the first time.\n\nFigure 1: To display Allan deviation (the square root of Allan variance) in the Phasemeter instrument, first display the data visualization panel. Then select “Allan deviation” from the drop-down menu.\n\nThe mathematics of Allan variance\n\nThe basic principle of Allan variance is to divide a time series into sections of equal duration and consider how the time average of each section differs from that of the previous section. If these differences, taken over the dataset as a whole, are small, then the system is stable on this timescale.\n\nFigure 2: The first step in the computation of is to segment the data into stretches of length τ and compute the time average, , of over each stretch. We then subtract consecutive averages and compute the RMS value of these differences. Dividing the result by yields the Allan variance for observation time τ.\n\nMore concretely, suppose we have a continuous time series , its Allan variance, , is defined as\n\nwhere denotes the expectation value (average) and is the ith sample of the average of y over observation time τ (Figure 2). Allan deviation is then simply the square root of Allan variance, or . One can evaluate this expression for a series of observation times τ to gain insight into how self-similar (i.e., stable) the data is over different timescales.\n\nAs can be inferred from equation (1), the dimension of matches that of y. We interpret the value to be the expected root mean square difference between two τ-second-long measurements of y taken τ seconds apart.\n\nFor example, consider a clock oscillating at . If the Allan variance of its fractional frequency difference, Y, defined as\n\nis 1.23×10-10 for a 10-second observation (τ = 10 s), then we would expect that two randomly chosen, consecutive, 10-second measurements of Y would differ by 1.23×10-10 RMS. Given the definition of fractional frequency difference, this is equivalent to an expected absolute frequency difference of RMS.\n\nConsider now the case of a real, finite, dataset of length M, sampled with period (Figure 3). In a sampled system we cannot choose the total time τ freely, so we divide the set into K segments of length for some . The Allan variance may be approximated as\n\nVery roughly, the uncertainty in is . A full treatment of measurement uncertainty is beyond the scope of this work, so see Ref [4] for more detail. To improve confidence in the results, and make more efficient use of valuable data, one can partition the data into overlapping segments (Figure 4). This yields pairs of consecutive segments, as opposed to previously. This overlapping Allan deviation is given by\n\nBeyond Allan variance\n\nJust as limitations were found with standard deviation, Allan deviation, too, is not the ideal statistic in all cases. Two commonly used derivatives of Allan deviation, offering improved performance in certain circumstances, are briefly discussed here for completeness.\n\nModified Allan deviation\n\nWe noted above the possibility of identifying noise sources based on the gradient traced on a plot of Allan deviation (Figure 6). Yet multiple noise sources present identical slopes. In particular, oscillator white phase modulation (WPM) noise and flicker phase modulation (FPM) noise both generate a slope of (see Table 1). However, WPM is sensitive to measurement bandwidth whereas FPM is not. By implementing an additional averaging over n adjacent measurements, where , this modified Allan deviation, , yields an effective bandwidth that narrows linearly with τ and enables these noise sources to be differentiated [7]. The modified Allan variance is given by\n\nor, more practically,\n\nwith\n\nTime deviation\n\nA further metric, based on the modified Allan deviation, is the time deviation, or time Allan deviation , defined by\n\nNote that this is nothing other than a “tilted” version of the modified Allan deviation (all slopes on a log-log plot will be reduced by one power of τ). The normalization factor is chosen such that agrees with the standard deviation for white phase modulation (WPM) noise when n = 1.\n\nTDEV is also often denoted by , making explicit the fact that it describes the stability of x (rather than y), due to the additional factor of τ.\n\nAs the name suggests, this measure is useful in the characterization of distributed timing signals, where it is used to describe the phase variation of a clock as a function of averaging time.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] D.
