        "text": "Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Damien Hirst. Our region is associated with some very famous names in the art world – artists who created some of their most groundbreaking and iconic work in sculpture.\n\nThis week the University of Leeds celebrates its role in Yorkshire Sculpture International (YSI), an exciting 100 days that will build on this legacy and provide a platform for contemporary artists from around the world. The event will be the biggest dedicated sculpture festival in the UK.\n\nWe have teamed up with four major art organisations in the region – the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds Art Gallery, The Hepworth Wakefield and Yorkshire Sculpture Park – to take part in the event, running from 22 June-29 September.\n\nAs well as a series of public exhibitions, international commissions, events and learning programmes, YSI has created more than 200 opportunities for our students.\n\nJane Bhoyroo, Yorkshire Sculpture International Producer, says: \"We are really excited to be working with the University of Leeds. This collaboration is a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with academic staff and students to bring fresh skills and expertise into the art sector.\n\n\"The University also brings something unique to our programme of events: a chance to explore sculpture from different perspectives such as material engineering, or virtual reality.\"\n\nThe University also brings something unique to our programme of events: a chance to explore sculpture from different perspectives such as material engineering, or virtual reality.\n\nJane Bhoyroo, Yorkshire Sculpture International Producer\n\nThe University already has its own fascinating connections with sculpture, making it an interesting setting for the YSI programme.\n\nA walk through campus, with its eclectic architecture and outdoor spaces, offers a journey where something creative is revealed on almost every corner. There are pieces of modern and contemporary sculpture that span decades, movements and materials, by creators from across the globe.\n\nDuring YSI, visitors are invited to explore these works and more with a walking tour – featuring our Public Art Trail - but they can also delve deeper into the genre through a series of academic-led discussions: Sculpture in the Round: Conversations about public art.\n\nThe conversations have been coordinated by the University’s Cultural Institute and are free and open to all. Further information and booking details are below.\n\nProfessor Frank Finlay, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Cultures, and Director of the Cultural Institute, says: \"Yorkshire Sculpture International is a fantastic and ambitious opportunity to build on our strong tradition of partnership with all four of the great Yorkshire arts institutions involved, creating exciting opportunities for our students, showcasing our impressive public art collection, including two new additions, and enabling the University to engage with the wider public.\"\n\nYorkshire Sculpture International is a fantastic and ambitious opportunity to build on our strong tradition of partnership with all four of the great Yorkshire arts institutions.\n\nProfessor Frank Finlay, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Cultures, and Director of the Cultural Institute\n\nTwo exciting artworks arrive on campus this summer to coincide with the event.\n\nHenry Moore’s Three Piece Reclining Figure No.2: Bridge Prop arrived on campus on 11 June on loan from Leeds Art Fund, via Leeds Museums and Galleries. The bronze sculpture piece, which weighs almost 900 kilos and evokes a reclining figure in abstract form, has taken up a long-term residency in our iconic Parkinson Building.\n\nOn 3 July, British-American artist Liliane Lijn will unveil Converse Column, a specially-commissioned piece sited at the entrance to our new innovation hub Nexus.\n\nLijn works with kinetic – moving – text, and is a pioneer in the interaction of art, science, technology and language. The work is a 9 metre-high revolving column of transforming words designed to represent communication and inspire collaboration.\n\nStaff and students have contributed ideas for the text. Lijn will be discussing her work and influences directly afterwards in her Sculpture in the Round event (details following).\n\nFrances Dee is one of seven students from our MA programmes in Art Gallery & Museum Studies and Arts Management & Heritage Studies who completed placements in the run-up to the festival. Mostly based at the Henry Moore Institute, she worked with its engagement team, running college art sessions as part of the YSI programme. It was an experience she loved.\n\nFrancis says: \"I gained experience that will help hugely in my own career plans to work in arts engagement and was taken on as an official YSI volunteer for the summer, which I am very pleased about.\"\n\nI gained experience that will help hugely in my own career plans to work in arts engagement and was taken on as an official YSI volunteer for the summer, which I am very pleased about.\n\nFrances Dee, MA Art Gallery & Museum Studies and Arts Management & Heritage Studies\n\nCurators from the Yorkshire Sculpture International programme have also delivered guest lectures for students including a two-day insight into curating. The partnership has offered training, too, for student ambassadors to assist with cultural events, improving skills and opportunities.\n\nProfessor Abigail Harrison Moore, Head of the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies, says: \"Yorkshire Sculpture International has offered our students an invaluable insight into career options in the thriving arts sector within our city and wider region.\n\n\"We have recently been ranked in the top five for Art and Design in the Complete University Guide and we work in partnership with our students to develop their skills and employability as well as academic excellence.\n\n\"We have also really enjoyed working with the YSI Team to nurture the next generation of artists through the National Saturday Club, and on our residential programme for art teachers, ‘Plan, Prepare, Provide’, especially at a time when opportunities to study the arts in schools are being reduced nationally.\"\n\nWe have also really enjoyed working with the YSI Team to nurture the next generation of artists through the National Saturday Club, and on our residential programme for art teachers, ‘Plan, Prepare, Provide’,\n\nProfessor Abigail Harrison Moore, Head of the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies\n\nNational Saturday Club is a weekly group for young people aged 13 to 16 run by our School of Fine Art, History of Art & Cultural Studies. The group have been visiting YSI’s partner galleries to explore sculpture and talk to staff about careers in the sector, and are joining artists on campus for a sculpture collaboration.\n\nYSI is also on the programme at the Plan, Prepare, Provide: Art Teachers Residential, an annual event organised by the University of Leeds which brings teachers from secondary schools and further education colleges together with art academics and professionals to share ideas and insight.\n\nDelegates will be able to learn about YSI first hand as part of the event, which will be hosted at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.\n\nThese events have been coordinated by the University’s Cultural Institute and are free and open to the public.

Bhabha’s approach is unconventional and cross-cultural, making connections between histories, languages and civilisations. This conversation will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about sculpture and place, chaired by University of Leeds Associate Professor Dr Joanne Crawford from the School of Fine Art, History of Art & Cultural Studies.\n\nLiliane Lijn in Conversation\n\nWednesday 3 July, 4.20-6.30pm\n\nNexus, University of Leeds\n\nBe part of the unveiling of Liliane Lijn’s new work ‘Converse Column’ on campus, then join the conversation to hear about her work and influences.
