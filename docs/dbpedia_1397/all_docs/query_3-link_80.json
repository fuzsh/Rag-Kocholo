A positive result, defined as pTau-181/Abeta42 ratio value above cutoff, is consistent with a positive amyloid PET scan result. A positive result does not establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder. The pTau-181/Abeta42 ratio result is used as an adjunct to other clinical diagnostic evaluations.\n\nThe use of AD biomarkers has been included in the new consensus research diagnostic criteria for AD, MCI and preclinical AD, proposed by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer’s Association. These new criteria take into account that AD dementia is part of a continuum of clinical and biological phenomena.4,5 The new International Working Group 2 (IWG2) criteria recommend the use of either CSF biomarker or amyloid PET imaging for evaluation of AD patients.6 In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) published a number of positive opinions on the use of biomarkers in the context of AD for enrichment of clinical trials in pre‑dementia and mild to moderate AD.\n\nClinical relevance of Abeta42\n\nThe Elecsys β-Amyloid (1-42) CSF II assay is designed to quantify the concentration of Abeta42 in CSF. The Abeta42 peptide is a small, 4 kDa protein of about 40 amino acids that is formed following proteolytic cleavage of a transmembrane protein known as amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cleavage of APP occurs via two events: cleavage by β‑secretase within the extracellular domain and cleavage by γ‑secretase in the transmembrane region. Due to its hydrophobic nature, the Abeta42 peptide has the propensity to form aggregates and oligomers. Oligomers of higher order form fibrils that accumulate into β‑Amyloid plaques.12\n\nAbeta42 peptide deposition in the brain is considered as one of the two hallmarks of AD, besides neurofibrillary tangles. It can be detected by several methods: (a) histopathological staining of Abeta42 deposits in post mortem brain tissue; (b) use of radiolabeled tracers that bind to β-Amyloid deposits in the brain and can then be detected in vivo using amyloid PET scan; (c) measuring the Abeta42 level in CSF because lower titers in CSF are believed to reflect accumulation of this molecule in the brain.13,14\n\nPathological changes in the β-Amyloid metabolism are the earliest alterations during AD development known so far that can be utilized diagnostically. They are reflected by the decrease in the CSF concentration of Abeta42 as well as by the increase in the brain uptake of the specific tracers on the amyloid PET.15 Current clinical diagnostic criteria for AD require a patient to have dementia before a diagnosis of AD can be made and are largely based on the exclusion of other disorders. No clinical method is available for identifying prodromal AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as such individuals have only mild disturbances in episodic memory.16\n\nNumerous studies show that while Abeta42 levels in CSF decrease to around half the level in controls, pTau-181 levels in CSF increase around two-to-three-fold in mild to moderate AD patients compared to age-matched controls.17,18 The pTau-181 levels in CSF are also associated with a faster progression from MCI to AD with more rapid cognitive decline in AD patients19 as well as in very mild AD dementia cases. The pTau-181 biomarker in CSF has the highest power when used in combination with Abeta42 in CSF for detecting the likely progression of subjects with MCI to AD.20\n\nClinical relevance of tTau\n\nTau (tubulin‑associated unit) protein is found as six molecular isoforms in the human brain. These isoforms are coded by a single gene on chromosome 17 and generated by alternative splicing of its pre‑mRNA. The Tau from all these isoforms is called total Tau (tTau). The Elecsys Total‑Tau CSF assay is designed to detect the six human brain Tau isoforms or soluble aggregates and fragments thereof in human CSF.\n\nIn AD, numerous studies show that while CSF β‑Amyloid (1‑42) levels decrease to around half the level in controls, CSF tTau levels increase around two-to-three-fold in mild to moderate AD patients compared to age‑matched controls.17,18 CSF tTau has been shown to reflect the intensity of the neuronal and axonal damage and degeneration. High CSF tTau is also associated with a faster progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.21 CSF tTau biomarker might be useful in detecting the likely progression of MCI to AD6 and has most power when used in combination with CSF β‑Amyloid (1‑42).22\n\nClinical relevance of pTau-181\n\nThe most common post‑translational modification of Tau proteins is phosphorylation. Phosphorylation changes the shape of the Tau molecule and regulates its biological activity. During neurodegeneration, abnormal phosphorylation leads to formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of the Tau protein that has undergone hyper‑phosphorylation and developed aggregates of hyper‑phosphorylated Tau proteins called Phospho‑Tau (pTau).22,23\n\nIn AD, numerous studies show that while Abeta42 levels in CSF decrease to around half the level in controls, CSF pTau-181 levels increase around two-to-three-fold in mild‑moderate AD patients compared to age‑matched controls.17,18 High CSF pTau-181 levels are also associated with a faster progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD with more rapid cognitive decline in AD patients20 and in mild AD dementia cases.24 6 pTau-181 as a biomarker in CSF might be useful in detecting the likely progression of MCI to AD25 and has most power when used in combination with Abeta42 in CSF."
