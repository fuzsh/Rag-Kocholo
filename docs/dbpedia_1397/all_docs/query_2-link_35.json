        "text": "Sigma Tau Delta is the international English honor society. Its purpose is to foster the discipline of English, including the celebration of creative and critical writing and the promotion of social interaction among its members. The organization encourages service and honors high standards of academic excellence.\n\nThe Alpha Beta Xi Chapter at Luther College was chartered in 1992, and initiations are held every spring. Marie Drews, associate professor of English, serves as the chapter’s sponsor.\n\nLuther’s Sigma Tau Delta chapter has been especially active in attending the organization’s annual convention, where students from across the U.S. present their critical and creative writing. Luther members have also been recognized by the society with scholarships and awards.\n\nEnglish department students excel at Sigma Tau Delta Conference\n\nLuther College senior Clara Wodny wins Sigma Tau Delta Study Abroad Scholarship\n\nMembers must have a minimum grade point average of a B (3.00) in English courses, rank in the highest 35 percent of their class, and have completed at least three semesters and have six credit hours in English beyond Paideia 111 and 112. Eligible students interested in membership may contact Marie Drews at any time. Membership incurs a small chapter dues fee and a one-time (larger) international chapter membership fee.\n\nMost meetings and functions sponsored by the society are open to all interested students, regardless of their academic standing or major/minor. Sigma Tau Delta hosts lectures and receptions for visiting writers, as well as festive occasions for students and faculty, such as the English Department’s welcome picnic and the holiday party.\n\nWould you like to see your work in print? Luther’s literary magazine, with an unbroken history of publication, accepts submissions each spring. Editors look forward to receiving poetry, flash fiction, nonfiction, photography, sculpture, painting, and music. All work received is evaluated anonymously; as you’re preparing your submissions, please make sure any documents, images of art work, or other media do not have your name on them. Calls for submissions are generally announced in January.\n\nAre you interested in serving on the editorial board of The Oneota Review? The student-run magazine regularly invites new members to join the editorial team that reviews submissions and offers feedback.\n\nTo inquire about submission deadlines or joining the editorial board, contact oneotareview@luther.edu.\n\nHanna Dodd\n\nWhen: February – May, 2021\n\nWhere: 1517 Media, Sparkhouse Imprint, Minneapolis, MN (but working remotely from Luther)\n\nMajor: English\n\nThroughout the spring of 2021, Hanna worked as an editorial intern at 1517 Media in the Sparkhouse division. During her internship, she helped create content for children ages preschool through high school in the form of crafts and activities, reading guides for Sparkhouse books, and worksheets to engage in Sparkhouse curriculum. She participated in meetings with the entire Sparkhouse department and got to see how a publishing company functions – from shipment and printing, to development and creating mock-ups of new products. Hanna had the pleasure of working with several Luther alumni, including her supervisor, Erin Gibbons ’08. This internship gave Hanna insight into the publishing industry, as well as experience to propel her career ambitions forward.\n\nEmma Schlabach\n\nWhen: January 2017\n\nWhere: Lanesboro Arts in Lanesboro, MN\n\nMajor: English\n\nIn January, Emma worked as an administrative intern at Lanesboro Arts. During her internship she reorganized the office filing system, helped maintain the website, wrote press releases, scheduled posts on social media, aided in grant writing, and helped install the Smithsonian Water/Ways exhibit. One of her projects was writing content for the website on the history of the organization. This involved interviewing staff as well as reading through old newspaper articles. An important skill Emma learned through this process was how to communicate in a variety of mediums, with an emphasis on clarity. Another rewarding part of her internship was working with so many great people, particularly alumna Kara Maloney ’16. Kara was Emma’s supervisor for this internship, and served as a supportive mentor. Lanesboro is a small, tight-knit community, so Emma was able to make many other wonderful connections. This experience shaped her post-graduation ambitions.\n\nJane Peña\n\nWhen: Summer 2016\n\nWhere: Playwrights’ Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nMajor: English\n\nJane spent this past summer working as an artistic intern for the Playwrights’ Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The nonprofit organization helps playwrights around the country develop new projects by hosting workshops, seminars, master classes, and providing other writing resources. Jane’s main duties included stage managing and researching playwriting opportunities for the Center to promote to its members. Through this experience, Jane gained experience in management and organization, as well as familiarity with the collaborative writing process. She felt that the opportunity to witness the creation of art and process of artistic discovery firsthand was especially rewarding. Jane enjoyed spending every day among people who are even more passionate about theatre than she is, and seeing new stories and ideas take shape. Working at the Playwrights’ Center helped Jane discover that there is an abundance of unique ways she could use her major beyond just teaching or writing, all of which would allow her to continue expressing her creativity and contributing to the world artistically.\n\nU.S. News and World Report ranks Luther College #2 for the highest percentage (82%) of graduates who studied abroad during college. The English faculty strongly encourage study abroad and in fact lead many of the college’s study abroad courses and programs, including popular study abroad offerings during January Term (J-Term), such as “In Frankenstein’s Footsteps: The Keats-Shelley Circle in London, Geneva, and Italy.” English and Paideia 450 courses led by English faculty in J-Term–such as “English Theatre”–have included travel to England, Ireland, Norway, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Ghana, and South Africa. Check out Luther’s current January term offerings.\n\nSemester and year-long study abroad opportunities are also popular with English majors. Most popular is the year-long program in Nottingham, England, which is often led by English faculty. The spring semester program in Malta also attracts many of our majors. As a member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM), Luther is also able to offer semester-long opportunities based in Chicago’s Newberry Library or other sites.\n\nLearn more about these opportunities and Luther’s flexible course transfer policy:\n\nNottingham (England) Year\n\nMalta and the Mediterranean\n\nAssociated Colleges of the Midwest’s Off-Campus Study Programs\n\nOther Luther Partner Programs"
