        "text": "BRACY HALL OF SCIENCE (2003)\n\nThis four-story natural sciences facility houses the departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Physics. Made possible through a lead gift from Jim and Vanita (Bauknight '63) Oelschlager, the facility is named for Dr. Carl C. Bracy, sixth president of Mount Union. The 87,000-square-foot structure includes 22 laboratories of various types and sizes, three lecture halls, two classrooms, and 21 faculty offices\n\nBracy Hall is home to the Clarke Astronomical Observatory (1968). Moved in May 2003 to the south end of Bracy Hall, it was previously located at the south end of East Hall. It is the second such building to honor the memory of Dr. George Washington Clarke, professor of natural philosophy at Mount Union. The first observatory, erected in 1924, served until it was razed to make room for the Timken Physical Education Building. The instruments, used in both observatories, are the gifts of Elmer E. Harrold of Leetonia, Ohio.\n\nCOPE MUSIC HALL (1964)\n\nCope Music Hall, part of the Giese Center for the Performing Arts, is named in memory of the late Kenneth B. Cope ’20, alumnus, trustee, and churchman. Principal donors to the building were his widow, Lela (Stoffer ’21) Cope, and family.\n\nThe building contains the offices and teaching studios of faculty members in the Department of Performing Arts. A dedicated instrumental rehearsal room, 30 practice rooms of various sizes, and three classrooms are on the east side of the building. In addition, a complete keyboard laboratory of 12 Roland electronic pianos is located in the music theory area, adjacent to a computer laboratory.\n\nThe facility includes Presser Recital Hall, which is dedicated to Theodore Presser, a former Mount Union student and professor. The three-manual organ in the recital hall is the gift of the Kulas Foundation.\n\nAlso located in this area is the Sturgeon Music Library, given in memory of Bertha Fogg Sturgeon and her parents, by Samuel Sturgeon. The collection of books, scores, and recordings was begun by a generous donation by Mrs. Ella Wilcox Peasley and the Carnegie Corporation. Presently, there are more than 7,000 recordings in LP and CD formats, more than 10,000 music scores, a music reference collection, and approximately 60 music periodical titles in the library. The facilities include four listening stations, an A-V room with stereo equipment, a TV and VCR, and a computer workstation with access to the campus network, the library system, and the Internet.\n\nGIESE CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS (2015)\n\nThe Performing Arts Center is named in honor of Dr. Richard F. and Sandra L. Giese in recognition of their exceptional service to the University from 2005 to 2015, during which time Dr. Giese served as president of the institution. The Gieses were at the forefront of the effort to provide enhanced and expanded space for the performing arts at Mount Union and were instrumental in making the dream of a center for the performing arts a reality.\n\nThe center houses the Department of Performing Arts and includes the Sally Otto Art Gallery, Gallaher Theatre, and Brush Performance Hall in addition to a choral room, green room, scene shop, costume shop, and dressing rooms.\n\nThe Sally Otto Art Gallery features exhibitions of work by students, faculty, and professionals throughout the academic year.\n\nThe Gallaher Theatre, a black box multipurpose space can host an array of events including improv theatre, theatre in the round, small music ensemble recitals, dance performances, and other entertainment events as well as banquets and receptions.\n\nThe proscenium-style Brush Performance Hall offers seating for 450 on its lower level and on its balcony. The acoustically significant, state-of-the-art space can host events of varied natures including vocal, instrumental, and theatrical performances.\n\nKOLENBRANDER-HARTER INFORMATION CENTER (2000) AND LIBRARY (1950)\n\nThe Kolenbrander-Harter Information Center provides 45,912 square feet of technology and learning space, which is directly linked to the traditional library space. It houses the Digital, Written, and Oral Communication Studio, PC labs, a Macintosh lab, a computer science lab, a language lab, several multimedia classrooms, 24-hour access to study space, computer labs, and vending. It also contains classrooms and office space for the School of Education and Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. The facility was made possible through a lead gift from Steve '84 and Suzanne (Spisak '84) Harter.\n\nOriginally built in 1950 and expanded in 1975, the University Library is located within the Kolenbrander-Harter Information Center. The library offers more than 230,000 books in open stacks, more than 900 current journal titles, back years of journals in both bound and microform format, and more than 350,000 federal government publications. Access to a wide range of computer databases and electronic full-text products is available via campus networked access to the Internet. Library collections are accessed through the OPAL catalog. Mount Union is part of a 19 library catalog consortium that uses the Innovative Interfaces software system. As part of the OhioLINK system, our users may borrow materials directly from all OPAL libraries as well as any of the 74 OhioLINK libraries throughout the state of Ohio. In addition to the OPAL catalog, the Mount Union library home page on the Internet offers access to more than 200 periodical indexes in a wide array of subject areas, more than 5,000 full-text periodical titles, a range of encyclopedias and dictionaries, and several gateways to federal government document resources. Special collections are located in the Rare Books Room and the Historical Room, which houses the University's archives and a local history collection. The estate of Louis H. Brush makes annual grants to purchase books and periodicals in memory of James Alpheus Brush, the first Librarian of the University, and his wife. The Thomas S. Brush Foundation, Inc. made a gift of approximately $500,000 in 1971 to the Endowment Fund of the University with the income to be used for the purchase of books and periodicals in memory of Mr. Brush's grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Louis H. Brush.\n\nVAN DEN EYNDEN HALL (1928)\n\nLocated at 136 Hartshorn St. and formerly known as the Administration Annex, the building was named in 1990 in recognition of the late Howard and Kathryn van den Eynden of Shaker Heights, Ohio. The building was the gift of an anonymous donor in 1940. Prior to that time, it housed the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, and from 1942-1962 it served as the College Student Union and a residence hall. In the years following through 2009, the facility housed a number of administrative offices and academic departments, including those dedicated to public relations and marketing, alumni, advancement, annual giving, religion and philosophy, and sociology. The building, renovated in 2018, now houses offices for the Regula Center and the Department of Social Sciences.\n\nMcPHERSON ACADEMIC AND ATHLETIC COMPLEX (2009)\n\nThe McPherson Academic and Athletic Complex (MAAC), opened on campus in 2009, is Mount Union’s primary health and wellness complex and an extremely popular gathering spot for students. The facility is named in honor of Richard ’50 and Dorothy (Werstler ’49) McPherson, whose generosity provided for the McPherson Center for Human Performance in 1996, as well as for this latest addition and renovation. In addition to a wrestling room, exercise science center and laboratory, athletic training facility, classrooms, laboratories, office spaces, and an area dedicated to student recruitment, the complex includes the McPherson Center for Human Performance (1996), Timken Physical Educational Building (1970), and Peterson Field House (1981). Within this latest addition, you'll find the Cicchinelli Fitness Center, and the Sweeney Auxiliary Gymnasium.\n\nThe Cicchinelli Fitness Center was made possible by Christopher Chicchinelli ’98 and his mother, Patricia Brisben. A two-story atrium takes you into a fitness center that has two floors housing free weights and cardiovascular and weight training machines.\n\nThe Sweeney Auxiliary Gymnasium provides additional practice space for Mount Union’s intramural program and recreational activities. The facility was made possible through the generosity of Sean ’79 and Caroline Sweeney.\n\nTIMKEN PHYSICAL EDUCATION BUILDING (1970)\n\nBuilt in 1970, the Timken Physical Education Building, part of the McPherson Academic and Athletic Complex (MAAC), includes a performance arena with three full-size basketball and volleyball courts with a seating capacity of 3,000. Also housed in the facility is a state-of-the-art sports medicine center that includes an athletic training room, offices, rehabilitation center, and hydrotherapy facilities. The Office of Athletics is located here along with classrooms, the M Club meeting room, and an interactive kiosk that includes the M Club Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Hammond Natatorium, renovated in 2009, includes a pool and diving area for recreation and varsity athletic competition. This home of the varsity swimming and diving team includes office space, storage, a scoreboard, and seating for 1,000 spectators. Hammond Construction generously provided the lead gift for this facility.\n\nBROWN VILLAGE (2007)\n\nThe Brown Village apartment community consists of three large manor houses – Clutter Manor, Jae Manor, and Keller Manor. Each manor house is three stories (equipped with an elevator), and each has three apartments per floor. These manors have common entrances for all residents in the facility and apartment (flat) with entrances off a common corridor.

This village community consists of three rows of houses, each with its own exterior entrance. The townhouse style of these structures gives students a real feeling of independence as they walk through their very own front door. These two-story houses have an open floor plan with a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and one bedroom on the first floor. The second floor consists of three bedrooms and a bathroom.
