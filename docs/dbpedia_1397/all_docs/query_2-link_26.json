        "text": "Large bronze statue of Buddha\n\nThe Big BuddhaTraditional Chinese天壇大佛Simplified Chinese天坛大佛\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinTiāntán Dà FóYue: CantoneseYale RomanizationTīn tàahn daaih fahtJyutpingTin1 taan4 daai6 fat6\n\nThe Big Buddha is a large bronze statue of Buddha, completed in 1993, and located at Ngong Ping, Lantau Island, in Hong Kong. The statue, located near the Po Lin Monastery which built it, is a tourist attraction.[1]\n\nConstruction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe statue's base is a model of the one in the United Kingdom. One of the five large Buddha statues in China, it is enthroned on a lotus on top of a three-platform altar.[2] Surrounding it are six smaller bronze statues known as \"The Offering of the Six Devas\" that are posed offering flowers, incense, lamp, ointment, fruit, and music to the Buddha, representing the Six Perfections of generosity, morality, patience, zeal, meditation, and wisdom, necessary for Enlightenment in Buddhism.[citation needed]\n\nThe 34 m (112 ft) tall statue weighs over 250 metric tons (280 short tons), and was constructed from 202 bronze pieces. In addition to the exterior components, there is a strong steel framework inside to support the heavy load. Visitors have to climb 268 steps to reach the Buddha,[2] though the site also features a small winding road for vehicles to provide access for disabled people. The Buddha's right hand is raised, representing the removal of affliction, while the left rests open on his lap in a gesture of generosity.\n\nThe monument also features three internal exhibit floors beneath the statue: the halls of the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned features inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha,[3] consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Big Buddha was constructed beginning in 1990, and was finished on 29 December 1993, which the Chinese reckon as the day of the Buddha's enlightenment. When the statue was completed, monks from around the world were invited to the opening ceremony. Distinguished visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United States all took part in the proceedings.[4]\n\nOn 18 October 1999, the Hong Kong Post Office issued a definitive issue of landmark stamps, of which the HK$2.50 value depicts The Big Buddha.[5] On 22 May 2012, it was also featured on the HK$3 value of the Five Festival set, this one celebrating the birth of Sakyamuni Buddha.\n\nVisiting and access\n\n[edit]\n\nPo Lin Monastery and the Buddha are open to the public between 10:00 and 17:30. Access to the outside of the Buddha is free of charge, but there is an admission fee to go inside the Buddha.\n\nVisitors can reach the site by bus or taxi, travelling first to Mui Wo (also known as \"Silvermine Bay\") via ferry from the Outlying Islands piers in Central (pier No. 6) or to Tung Chung station via the MTR, or cable car. Visitors may then travel to and from the Buddha via the following bus routes:\n\nMui Wo ↔ Ngong Ping — NLB No. 2\n\nTung Chung ↔ Ngong Ping – NLB No. 23\n\nThe Ngong Ping 360 gondola lift between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping (25 minutes).[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLaykyun Sekkya\n\nGreat Buddha of Thailand\n\nBuddha Dordenma statue\n\nGreat Buddha\n\nBuddhist art\n\nChinese Buddhism\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
