        "text": "The Mini-tau is an ultra-compact, low cost, filter-based dedicated fluorescence lifetime spectrometer. Using the Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) technique, the Mini-tau can measure fluorescence lifetimes ranging from 25 ps to 10 Î¼s*. It can also be equipped with Multi-Channel Scaling (MCS) electronics for long-range photoluminescence from 10 ns to 10 s.\n\nWhether you need to measure fluorescence lifetimes or time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy for research, quality assurance or teaching applications, the Mini-tau is the ideal all-inclusive, fully-integrated solution. The Mini-tau measures fluorescence lifetimes after numerical reconvolution based on the established Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.\n\nThe Fluoracle Software supplied with the Mini-tau has an easy-to-use interface and allows users to comprehensively record data and accurately analyse complex decay kinetics of up to 4 lifetimes.\n\n*Minimal lifetime resolution is laser dependent.\n\nFor more information, or to enquire, please contact a member of our sales team at sales@edinst.com.\n\nFluoracle spectrometer operating software is at the heart of all our fluorescence spectrometers and is a fully comprehensive, user-friendly data analysis software package. Irrespective of system configurations, this software provides the user with complete control of the instrument and of most third-party accessories.\n\nFluoracle is Windows compatible and is based on a data centred design that enables the user to focus on their measurement. This guarantees ease-of-use in the operation of a modular and potentially complex spectrometer.\n\nMeasurement set-up and data acquisition is made through an intuitive menu system. Key spectroscopic parameters are easily accessed through functional groupings, while common measurement routines can be saved as method files to allow previous experiments to be easily repeated. Tabbed dialogue boxes and particular scan parameters are always visible during set-up. The current status of the instrument is also continuously displayed.\n\nFluoracle offers the FAST add on for the advanced analysis of fluorescence and phosphorescence decay kinetics."
