        "text": "Quick and easy: Coupled with the user-friendly on-board app, DYNAMICS Touch™, quick and robust results are just a few clicks away.\n\nMaximum power: Paired with the full power of PC-based DYNAMICS™, the ZetaStar can determine extended solution properties including:\n\nColloidal stability: second virial coefficient (A2 or B22) and diffusion interaction parameter (kD), turbidity or opalescence\n\nThermal stability: temperature of protein melting or aggregation onset (Tm, Tonset, Tagg)\n\nAccelerate degradation kinetics: the evolution of size and molar mass with time at elevated temperature.\n\nMinimum downtime: Constructed of a set of field-replaceable modules with no need for optical alignment, the ZetaStar need never leave your lab for maintenance. A Wyatt technician can make most repairs on-site.\n\nAutosampler operation\n\nThe ZetaStar flow cell enables automated sample handling with an Arc™ HPLC autosampler. An autosampler and pump are controlled directly by DYNAMICS™ and HPLC CONNECT™ software to flush the system, inject sample, perform the measurement, and repeat with the next sample. DYNAMICS can be programmed to run an entire sequence, with solvent flushes between samples to prevent carryover.\n\nAutomating buffer conditions\n\nDo you need to measure zeta potential or net molecular charge as a function of concentration, pH, ionic strength or excipient? The autosampler can be used to run pre-prepared samples at varying buffer conditions, saving you the time required to run each set individually.\n\nAutomation not for you?\n\nIf automation is not required, several convenient options are available for manual operation: samples may be injected directly into the flow cell (with or without the Atlas™) or measured by means of quartz or single-use cuvettes, and dip electrodes for ELS.\n\nDLS/SLS/ELS\n\nIf a sample must be analyzed by all three techniques, it’s easy to run through them with a quartz cell. First, measure DLS & SLS in the quartz cuvette for size, particle concentration, molar mass and/or turbidity. Then insert the dip electrodes and measure DLS & ELS for particle size and zeta potential.\n\nOn-line MALS and DLS in a shared flow cell\n\nFor heterogeneous nanoparticles or macromolecules samples, measurements in batch (i.e., without fractionation and automated loading) can only go so far in terms of resolution and depth of analysis. For higher resolution and deeper understanding, upstream separation—usually by size—is needed.\n\nWyatt offers two primary analytical separation methods for use with light scattering: size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and field-flow fractionation (FFF).\n\nA DAWN™ multi-angle light scattering (MALS) instrument, often along with other detectors like UV/Vis, refractive index and/or differential viscosity, receives the separated analytes and analyzes nearly homogeneous fractions to characterize distributions of molar mass, size, conformation, composition and more.\n\nSEC-MALS is primarily applied to macromolecules, while\n\nFFF-MALS is primarily for nanoparticles, though there is overlap between these techniques.\n\nFor smaller molecules such as proteins, MALS cannot measure size directly via the angular dependence and so DLS is an important complementary technique. For nanoparticles, the shape factor Rg:Rh determined by MALS (Rg) and DLS (Rh) is a useful indicator of conformation.\n\nInstead of adding another detector in-line, with the associated band broadening, dilution, signal misalignment and loss of resolution, Wyatt's innovative solution is to share the MALS laser and flow cell with a DLS detector.\n\nWith the online DLS option, a ZetaStar can be coupled to a MALS flow cell and switch automatically between on-line and native batch (cuvette) modes. In on-line mode, the ASTRA™ chromatography software connects to the ZetaStar to acquire DLS data for its analyses.\n\nDYNAMICS™ - Software for electrophoretic, dynamic and static light scattering measurements in the ZetaStar. Calculates:\n\nsize and size distributions\n\nelectrophoretic mobility, zeta potential, and effective charge\n\nmolecular weight\n\nparticle concentration\n\nthermal stability via thermal ramps as temperature of protein melting or aggregation onset (Tm, Tonset, Tagg)\n\ncolloidal stability via second virial coefficient (A2 or B22) or diffusion interaction parameter (kD)\n\nturbidity/opalescence\n\nkinetics from the evolution of size and molar mass with time\n\nDYNAMICS enables comparison of multiple samples and measurements, even if taken on different days or with different instruments. It supports Wyatt’s NanoStar™ and DynaPro™ Plate Reader DLS/SLS instruments as well as the ZetaStar and legacy DLS and ELS instruments. DYNAMICS also controls autosamplers and pumps for hands-off analyses of dozens of samples per day.\n\nDYNAMICS is offered with a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant Security Pack option, enabling the use of the ZetaStar, NanoStar and DynaPro Plate Reader in a GMP environment.\n\nDynaPro™ NanoStar™ - Like the ZetaStar, the NanoStar DLS/SLS instrument offers walk-up convenience with the DYNAMICS Touch™ on-board app, alongside comprehensive analysis using DYNAMICS™ on a PC. Measure size, polydispersity, particle concentration, turbidity and molar mass (but not zeta potential or charge). With sample volumes as small as 2 µL and temperature control spanning -10 °C to +120 °C, the NanoStar goes above and beyond traditional cuvette-based DLS instruments. It offers an optimized static light scattering detector in parallel to the DLS detection system in order to determine true molar mass and reliable particle concentrations."
