        "text": "How is torque measured?\n\nThe SI unit for torque is the Newton-meter.\n\nIn imperial units, the Foot-pound is often used. This is confusing because colloquially the pound is sometimes used as a unit of mass and sometimes force. What is meant here is pound-force, the force due to earth gravity on a one-pound object. The magnitude of these units is often similar as 1Nm≃1.74ft⋅lbs‍.\n\nMeasuring a static torque in a non-rotating system is usually quite easy, and done by measuring a force. Given the length of the moment arm, the torque can be found directly. Measuring torque in a rotating system is considerably more difficult. One method works by measuring strain within the metal of a drive shaft which is transmitting torque and sending this information wirelessly.\n\nWhat is rotational equilibrium?\n\nThe concept of rotational equilibrium is an equivalent to Newton’s 1ˢᵗ law for a rotational system. An object which is not rotating remains not rotating unless acted on by an external torque. Similarly, an object rotating at constant angular velocity remains rotating unless acted on by an external torque.\n\nThe concept of rotational equilibrium is particularly useful in problems involving multiple torques acting on a rotatable object. In this case it is the net torque which is important. If the net torque on a rotatable object is zero then it will be in rotational equilibrium and not able to acquire angular acceleration.\n\nExercise 1:\n\nConsider the wheel shown in Figure 3, acted on by two forces. What magnitude of the force F2‍ will be required for the wheel to be in rotational equilibrium?\n\nSolution:\n\nWe begin by finding the torque τ1‍ due to F1‍.\n\nτ1=Frsin⁡(θ)=(5N)⋅(0.075m)sin⁡(135∘)≃+0.265Nm‍\n\nNote that here we are defining positive torque in the direction out of the page. We know that in rotational equilibrium\n\nτ1+τ2=0‍\n\nso\n\nτ2=−F2⋅0.1m⋅sin⁡(90∘)‍ and therefore F2≃2.65N‍"
