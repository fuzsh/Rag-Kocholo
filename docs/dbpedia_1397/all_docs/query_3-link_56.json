The energy asymmetries for the decays tau..--> nu../sub tau/enu-bar/sub e/, tau..--> nu../sub tau/..mu..nu-bar/sub ..mu../, tau..--> nu../sub tau/..pi.., and tau..--> nu../sub tau/rho are interpreted as effects caused by the combination of maximally parity-violating weak tau decays and a longitudinal polarization produced by the interference of electromagnetic and weak processes. From the forward-backward polarization asymmetry A/sub P/ = (0.06 +- 0.07) x (1 +- 0.011), we determine the coupling-constant product g/sub a//sup e/g/sub v//sup tau/ = (0.26 +- 0.31) x (1 +- 0.011). Assuming g/sub a//sup e/ = -(1/2 as expected, we find g/sup tau//sub v/ = (-0.52 +- 0.62) x (1 +- 0.011), consistent with the prediction of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model of electroweak interactions. Alternatively, assuming the standard-model prediction of negligible polarization in tau-pair production, the leptonic energy spectra are used to measure the Michel parameter to be 0.79 +- 0.10 +- 0.10, consistent with the V-A hypothesis for the taunu-bar/sub tau/-W vertex.},\n\ndoi = {10.1103/PhysRevD.36.1971},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6146262}, journal = {Phys.
