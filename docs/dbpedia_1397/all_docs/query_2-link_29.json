        "text": "Kristen Kautz\n\nWinter Carnival Royal Majesty\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nHello! I am thrilled to introduce myself as the Winter Carnival Royalty representative for Phi Kappa Tau. My name is Kristen Kautz, I am from Lapeer, Michigan and came to Michigan Tech to study Chemical Engineering. I graduate this spring. After graduation, I will work for Marathon Petroleum in St. Paul, Minnesota. During my time at Michigan Tech, I have been actively involved on and off campus to contribute to our unique community. I am mostly involved with my sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta, which has allowed me to participate in philanthropic events and personally develop. I contribute to the Alternative Energy Enterprise where I work with Dr. Shonnard and Dr. Kulas in their laboratory to convert waste plastics into diesel fuel. I am passionate about sustainability and looking for innovative ways to paint a greener future. I enjoy activities such as knitting, traveling, and being outside. Winter Carnival holds a special place in my heart because of its traditions and cherished memories I have made during my time at Michigan Tech. I am honored to carry on these traditions and create more memories by being a candidate for Winter Carnival Royalty this year!\n\nEliya Huebner\n\n1st Runner Up\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nHi everyone! I am Eliya Huebner, this year's Guardians of the North Winter Carnival Royalty representative, sponsored by the best breakfast in Houghton - Suomi's Home Bakery and Restaurant! I am a fourth-year Biochemistry and Molecular Biology student and I am also a cadet in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program. Once I graduate this spring, I will commission as a second lieutenant into the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Aside from being a student and cadet, I am the National Vice Commander of the professional service organization, Arnold Air Society (AAS), and a regular volunteer at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFWs) here in the Keweenaw. In my free time, you can find me cruising through powder at Mt. Bohemia, ripping down the Tech trails on my mountain bike, pumping some iron in the SDC, and hiking a local trail to some waterfalls! Winter is my favorite season, and I'm thrilled to be a Royalty candidate this year to represent my love of snow, Michigan Tech, and the Upper Peninsula. I look forward to bringing this love and my Husky tenacity with me out West to my first Air Force base assignment this spring!\n\nSamantha Ludwick\n\n2nd Runner Up\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nHey everyone, I'm Samantha Ludwick and I'm the Royalty candidate representing Delta Zeta Sorority and Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity! I'm in my fourth year at Tech and will be graduating with a bachelor's in Medicinal Chemistry this semester. My hometown is Midland, Michigan and I plan to work for Dow as a Sales Specialist after graduation. Outside of classes I enjoy volunteering, staying involved with my sorority, and being an active member in the Chemistry Department. In my time in Houghton, I've picked up a few winter hobbies, so don't be afraid to say hello if you see me on the Tech Trails or at Mont Ripley. Winter Carnival is my favorite tech tradition, and I'm incredibly excited to compete in the Royalty Competition this year. Wishing everyone the best of luck, and happy Carny!\n\nEvelyn James\n\nAudience Choice Award\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nI'm Evelyn James, a third-year mechanical engineering student. Originally from southeast Wisconsin, Houghton brought me north! I'm representing St. Albert the Great Catholic Campus Ministries in this year's Winter Royalty Competition. Here at MTU I've enjoyed a plethora of opportunities. In the past two years I've been an LEAP Leader, Maker Space Coach, and delved into the Winter Carnival festivities (proud human bowling ball in snow bowling!). This year I joined Dr. Malladi in the VITALS research group, where I've been able to apply myself to complete our research goals in acoustics and vibrations. I was also an Engineering Learning Center coach this fall semester where I got to help students. At St. Albert the Great Catholic Campus Ministries I lead a Bible study with 15 (and growing) amazing women. I have countless hobbies, but I group them into three categories: creating, absorbing, and destroying. I like to create with any medium. I enjoy absorbing knowledge through reading and learning. I like to destroy through dismantling items and kickboxing. I'm now excited to create memories, absorb knowledge, and destroy my minor stage fright through participating in the Winter Royalty Competition this year!\n\nMary Christine Stevens\n\nCongeniality Award\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nMary Christine Stevens (she/her) is a third-year Marketing/English major with a French minor. Mary enjoys hiking, reading, crocheting, and spending time outdoors with her family. She's interested in politics, journalism, and squishmallows. Mary is a Senior Resident Assistant, a Lead Writing Center Coach, and holds several positions in the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, including social events coordinator and Stage Revue coordinator. Mary has several articles published with Trill Magazine, and is working on getting her first book published. Her biggest inspiration is her uncle, who was born with an extremely rare disability. He shows her how life can still be full of love and joy, even if things don't work out quite how one planned. Her favorite thing to do at Tech is go on volunteer trips during Alternative Spring Break and go for walks in the snow. She spends a significant amount of her paycheck on Biggby coffee and sushi. After college, Mary plans to pursue a career in journalism, with a focus on politics and international affairs. She would also like to extend a thank-you to Roy's Pasties for sponsoring her.\n\nVanessa Dulong\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nFrom forests to shores, we love the outdoors. Happy Winter Carnival, I hope you enjoy yours! I'm Vanessa Dulong, the royalty representative for SoundGirls! SoundGirls is a national organization whose mission is to empower the next generation of women and minorities in the audio industry. I'm the current MTU chapter president. I'm a fourth-year Sound Design major with a minor in Media Production. I'll be continuing my education at Michigan Tech next year to pursue an additional minor in Business. While attending MTU, I've become an active member of the CinOptic Media and Communication Enterprise and have had the opportunity to work on numerous productions with the Visual and Performing Arts program. I was born and raised in Hancock, Michigan, and grew up annually attending Winter Carnival. I've always enjoyed checking out the snow statues and cheering on Husky hockey. Now as a student, I've had the best time participating in the all-nighter with my organization and can't wait to make my DJing debut on the ice speakers this year. My experience and local roots introduce a unique outlook on Winter Carnival, and I'm thrilled to represent another side of Michigan Tech as a candidate for Winter Carnival Royalty!\n\nAva Farquhar\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nHello! I am Ava Farquhar, representing Alpha Sigma Tau in this year's Winter Carnival Royalty event. I was born in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and have three siblings: two older sisters, and one younger puppy named Mabel. I am a Chemical Engineering student starting a career as a Process Engineer after graduation. As a Husky, I've been involved on campus with many clubs such as my sorority, fishing club, and Women's Leadership Council. I love to take road trips and have traveled across the country for work and fun, but the Copper Country is always my favorite place to be. Outside of work and school, I like to volunteer with Keweenaw Wild Ones where I planted and maintained a native plant garden in Hancock, and Omega House, a local hospice organization. I love giving back to the community that has given me so much. In my spare time, I like to backpack the Porkies and the Pictured Rocks, hike and bike the Keweenaw trails, draw, and identify the plants and mushrooms I find on my adventures. I'm so thankful to share the nomination with such inspirational and incredible people for this year's Winter Carnival Royalty event.\n\nMacKenzie Stevens\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nHello everyone! My name is MacKenzie Stevens and I am the Winter Carnival Royalty representative for Alpha Gamma Delta and Beta Sigma Theta. I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student with a minor in Polymer Science and Engineering. Ever since I visited Michigan Tech during my senior year of high school I have been in love with the Keweenaw! There are so many wonderful things that I have had the privilege to experience during my time here at Michigan Tech like being able to serve my sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta, as VP of Campus Relations, VP of Marketing, and volunteering with 31 Backpacks and of course during Make A Difference Day. Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are to play sports like softball, tennis, and rock climbing.
