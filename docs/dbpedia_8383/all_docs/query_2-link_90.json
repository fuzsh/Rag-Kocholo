Dear Colleagues: The United States must revive its global and moral leadership to address the urgent plight of millions of people forced to flee their homes due to conflict, violence, persecution, and severe climate-related events. This global forced migration crisis is one of the most profound and least understood challenges of our time. More than ever before, conflict and violence are driving people from their homes and forcing them to live decades in displacement. Warring parties are consistently ignoring humanitarian laws designed to protect civilians during conflict, leading to civilian casualties, the destruction of critical infrastructure, and mass displacement. Other drivers of forced migration, including generalized violence and severe climate-related events, such as droughts, flooding, extreme weather, and rising sea levels, show no signs of abating. Meanwhile, the global response has not kept pace with the enormity of need. The international community and national authorities have failed to address these causes of displacement. International organizations and host countries are struggling to protect and facilitate solutions for a growing population of forced migrants. More than ever before, U.S. leadership is needed to foster and catalyze a global coalition to address this crisis. Since its founding, the United States has offered freedom and opportunity to people around the world fleeing danger. Our history of welcoming desperate people with open arms--from European Jews following World War II to Indochinese boat people to Kosovar victims of ethnic cleansing--has reinforced our reputation as a place of refuge. Many of those who originally came to the United States seeking protection have gone on to become shining beacons for our nation--artists, innovators, public servants, and even representatives of the U.S. government. The Trump administration, however, has departed sharply from this historical precedent, abdicating U.S. leadership and undermining a global response. Available legal pathways for asylum, refugee resettlement, and protection in the United States have been severed. Refugees from Muslim- majority countries, including those fleeing atrocities in Syria, have been barred. Small children have been forcibly separated from their families and held in detention centers. Migrants fleeing violence and threats to their lives have been returned by the United States to dangerous border encampments in Mexico, waiting for decisions on their applications for months or even years. (v) Given this challenging landscape, I directed my senior Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff member for Migration & Human Rights, Charlotte Oldham-Moore, and SFRC Democratic Staff to prepare a comprehensive report on the global forced migration crisis. In conducting research for this report, SFRC Democratic Staff interviewed dozens of migration and humanitarian experts, analyzed key documents and reports, and carried out research trips to Colombia, Tunisia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Mexico, and Ethiopia, meeting with U.S. and national, provincial, and municipal government officials, United Nations and international nongovernmental organization representatives, as well as forced migrants and their host communities. I also want to thank Marisa Lowe, Judith Williams, and the SFRC Democratic Staff for their work on this report. The result of this research is a comprehensive report that lays bare the facts of today's global forced migration crisis, the drivers of displacement, the trends impacting the situations of forced migrants, the international community's response, and the Trump administration's retreat. It describes a global forced migration crisis that is, at its crux, a political crisis requiring political solutions to confront the drivers of forced migration, as well as address the large numbers living in displacement. This report makes the case for urgent and sweeping action on the global forced migration crisis and argues the need for the United States to make a dramatic course correction in leading this global response. The report also makes timely recommendations for Congress, the Executive Branch, the United Nations, and other stakeholders to improve policies on forced migration. Today, there must be a bipartisan sense of urgency for renewed U.S. efforts to reform our domestic policies and international engagement relating to migration. Ignoring the plight of millions of forced migrants worldwide will only ensure that our future--the world's and the United States'-- will be far less secure and far bleaker. As the world grapples with global crisis, we must come together in global solidarity and remember those among us who have experienced the utmost dangers and require protection. Sincerely, Robert Menendez, Ranking Member.

Matthew Stroup, 130209-N-LR347-329, U.S. Navy, Feb. 9, 2013. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---------- A girl born in a refugee camp lives her whole life in a temporary shelter, waiting to return home to a community she has never known, a community repeatedly ravaged by war. A farmer leaves his village when insurgents arrive, then searches and fails to find shelter, water, and food. He is told to return home and is then displaced again by conflict, cycling back and forth in continuous, destitute movement. A nurse, terrorized by gang violence outside her home and domestic violence inside her home, fears for her and her daughter's lives and leaves. They are turned away at the border, forced to wait, living in perilous tent encampments on the border, and finally deported back to danger. A fisherman is forced from their coastal community due to rising sea levels--they are no longer able to find sufficient potable water for their family to drink. They move to an urban slum to live amongst thousands of others who have suffered the same plight. A local official is forced to leave her island after tropical storm after tropical storm forces her to come to terms with the fact that her home is no longer inhabitable. She struggles to not only find somewhere for herself and her family, but for her whole island's population--now forced to flee. No one is willing to provide them safe haven. The rich countries have closed their borders and erected walls that thousands of individuals attempt to circumvent daily. The poorer countries are inundated, less stable, and unable to provide services or safety. Thousands die each year attempting to find some place that will accept them. Millions are subjected to violence and abuse. Millions of children go uneducated. These are the stories of forced migrants today. The exponentially increasing number of men, women, and children forced from their homes due to conflict, persecution, and severe climate-related weather events is one of the most profound and least understood challenges facing the world. Despite the global upheaval this crisis presents, too few political leaders, policymakers, and members of the public are aware of the facts. By the end of 2018, 70.8 million people were forcibly displaced across the world, including 25.9 million refugees, 41.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), and 3.5 million asylum seekers.\\1\\ These figures may not include, however, forced migrants who are not recognized under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its accompanying international legal framework, such as those fleeing generalized violence or severe climate-related events. The forced migrant crisis will continue to swell as existing conflicts continue, new conflicts arise, and the impacts of climate change spur new conflicts, render communities uninhabitable, and cause severe weather events. In the absence of swift, effective action, the number of forced migrants could climb to more than 300 million over the next decade--a population nearly equal to that of the entire United States.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018, at 2, 65-66, 68-69 (June 2019).

The loss of support from key world leaders has dealt a startling blow to an international community already struggling to address the drivers of forced migration, and to protect and find permanent solutions for forced migrants. Without a significant course correction towards robust U.S. leadership and an engaged international community, the global forced migration challenges we face today will compound in coming decades. If we fail to act, the crisis will not only pose serious risks to the many million forced migrant lives at stake, but will inevitably challenge global stability, economic growth, and U.S. national security. Today's forced migration crisis is driven by several factors, including increasingly frequent and intense conflict, as well as climate change. From 2013 to 2018, the number of active conflicts worldwide increased by 53 percent from 34 to 52 conflicts.\\3\\ As of 2013, the average length of conflict was 37 years.\\4\\ State and non-state actors alike are more blatantly violating international humanitarian law and deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, such as medical facilities and schools.\\5\\ In 2018, a record- breaking 12,000-plus children were killed or maimed by conflict.\\6\\ Nearly 31 million children were displaced at the end of 2017.\\7\\ Furthermore, the effects of climate change, including more frequent and severe natural disasters, are increasingly forcing people to flee their homes.\\8\\ In 2016, 24 million people were newly displaced due to sudden-onset natural disasters--outnumbering new displacement associated with conflict and violence by 3 to 1.\\9\\ Unfortunately, there is no clear end or reversal in sight for any of these trends. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Scott Gates et al., Trends in Armed Conflict, 1946-2014, Peace Research Institute Oslo, at 2 (2016).

Despite specific conventions affording refugees international protection, refugees are frequently denied access to rights and services.\\11\\ Without international accountability, the situation of vulnerable refugees continues to deteriorate.\\12\\ Yet the circumstances are far worse for those without formal international protections, including those forcibly displaced within their countries (IDPs), as well as those forced to flee due to severe climate change-related events and generalized violence.\\13\\ Although some countries and regions have taken steps to provide IDPs with protection, many still, including the United States, have yet to recognize and address these vulnerable populations.\\14\\ Moreover, the traditional solutions for refugees--voluntary return, resettlement in a third country, or integration into their host country--are proving difficult to achieve, with voluntary returns and resettlement at historic lows.\\15\\ Without drastic international coordination and action, the magnitude of need will continue to swell. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Council on Foreign Relations, ``No Refuge: Why the World's Swelling Refugee Population Has Shrinking Options,'' Feb. 12, 2019; World Refugee Council, Centre for International Governance Innovative, A Call to Action: Transforming the Global Refugee System, at 2-3 (2019). \\11\\ See, e.g., Asylum Access & the Refugee Work Rights Coalition, Global Refugee Work Rights Report 2014 (Sep. 2014); Amnesty International, Fears and Fences: Europe's Approach to Keeping Refugees at Bay (Nov. 2015). \\12\\ World Refugee Council, Centre for International Governance Innovative, A Call to Action: Transforming the Global Refugee System, at 10, 27 (2019). \\13\\ Kathleen Newland, Rethinking Global Protection: New Channels, New Tools, Transatlantic Council on Migration & Migration Policy Institute (Apr. 2015). \\14\\ World Refugee Council, Centre for International Governance Innovative, A Call to Action: Transforming the Global Refugee System, at 10 (2019). \\15\\ Danish Refugee Council et al., Joint NGO Recommendations on Durable Solutions for the Global Compact on Refugees' Programme of Action, at 3 (Dec. 12, 2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At this critical moment, the United States has deliberately turned its back on those seeking refuge. The Trump administration has crippled the United States' refugee resettlement, asylum, and temporary protection systems, and even closed our borders to those with legitimate asylum claims and protection needs. After resettling over 207,000 refugees in 1980, we resettled just 30,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2019.\\16\\ For Fiscal Year 2020, the Trump administration's refugee ceiling is 18,000--the lowest in U.S. history at a time when the number of forced migrants has reached its highest in recorded history.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Migration Policy Institute, ``U.S. Annual Refugee Resettlement Ceilings and Number of Refugees Admitted, 1980-Present,'' https:// www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/us-annual-refugee- resettlement-ceilings-and-number-refugees-admitted-united (last visited Aug. 27, 2019); U.S. Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration Refugee Processing Center, ``Historical Arrivals Broken Down by Region (1975-Present),'' https:// www.wrapsnet.org/documents/ Refugee%20Admissions%20by%20Region%20since%201975%20as%20of%204-9- 20.pdf (last visited Apr. 13, 2020). \\17\\ Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2020, Presidential Determination No. 2020-04, Nov. 1, 2019; UNHCR, Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018, at 2 (June 2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These regressive actions have damaged the United States' moral leadership, demonstrated a retreat from global leadership in responding to crises, and compromised our ability to forge cooperative relationships with our international partners. The administration's ``Zero Tolerance Policy'' separated terrified migrant children, including infants, from their parents, and drew criticism from Congress, the United Nations, religious leaders, and medical professionals, among many others.\\18\\ The decimation of U.S. refugee resettlement has left refugee- hosting countries like Jordan, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Turkey in a bind with fewer opportunities for resolution.\\19\\ While the United States previously led the charge on championing refugee resettlement and human rights, the Trump administration has actively hindered international efforts to respond to the forced migration crisis. By damaging our global reputation and relationships with other countries, the United States' actions towards forced migrants impair our ability to effectively rally international cooperation, including in situations where our own security and stability is threatened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Kevin D.

Such efforts are game-changing, but nascent. The World Bank has partnered with the United Nations and others to extend concessional financing and grants to low- and middle-income countries struggling with the fiscal impact of hosting large refugee populations.\\20\\ There is also growing use of technology and private sector engagement working to better serve forced migrant populations.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ World Bank Group International Development Association, ``IDA18 Regional Sub-Window for Refugees and Host Communities,'' http:/ /ida.worldbank.org/replenishments/ida-18replenishments/ida18-regional- sub-window-for-refugees-host-communities (last visited Aug. 27, 2019); Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), 2017-2018 Annual Report, at 5-6 (Dec. 2018). Concessional financing can be in the form of grants, or loans. Concessional loans have more generous terms than market loans. They generally include below-market interest rates, grace periods in which the recipient is not required to make debt payments for several years or a combination of low interest rates/grace periods.

While funding for humanitarian responses has increased, exponentially increasing needs have created a wider gap. In 2007, the United Nations reported a 2 percent or approximately 2 billion dollar shortfall on its appeals for humanitarian response funding.\\22\\ As of 2018, the number has risen to an appalling shortfall of 39 percent, or approximately 10 billion dollars in unmet needs.\\23\\ At the same time, vulnerable groups remain in limbo while solutions to their plight cannot keep pace. In 2018, for example, there was a more than 99 percent gap between the number of refugees worldwide and global resettlement spaces.\\24\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ UNOCHA, Financial Tracking Service, ``Appeals and response plans 2007,'' https://fts.unocha.org/appeals/overview/2007 (last visited June 5, 2020).

The fates of millions of desperate and suffering forced migrants cannot be ignored--at the very least, because their susceptibility to the virus represents a potential obstacle in the global fight against the pandemic. The path to solving global crises is forged through international cooperation and commitments--not cowardice. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ Refugees International, COVID-19 and the Displaced: Addressing the Threat of the Novel Coronavirus in Humanitarian Emergencies (Mar. 30, 2020); International Rescue Committee, COVID-19 in Humanitarian Crises: A Double Emergency (Apr. 2020); Andrej Mahecic, ``Displaced people urgently need aid and access to social safety nets as coronavirus causes severe hardship,'' UNHCR, May 1, 2020; UNOCHA, Global Humanitarian Response Plan: COVID-19, at 13-16 (Mar. 2020). \\26\\ Mauro Testaverde, ``Social protection for migrants during the COVID-19 crisis: The right and smart choice,'' World Bank Blogs, Apr. 28, 2020.

Current trends, including the challenge of climate change, will force more people to flee their homes, be on the move, and live in displacement. As the number of those forcibly displaced continues to balloon, the need for innovative and comprehensive international responses is imperative. Under the Trump administration, the United States has responded to the forced migration crisis with fear and regressive policies. In order to mitigate global instability and regain our standing as a nation committed to principled leadership in the world, the United States must reverse course and lead the charge in securing international cooperation and new solutions for today's forced migrants. How the United States chooses to respond to these events will define the world we will live in, and the role the United States plays in it. Defining Forced Migration For the purposes of this report, we use the term ``forced migration'' to refer to the movement of people in which the drivers involve force, compulsion, or coercion. This includes those forcibly displaced by persecution and conflict across country borders (refugees and asylum seekers) and within country borders (IDPs), and additionally seeks to encompass people who migrate due to other situations of violence, severe climate-related events, trafficking, as well as a range of potentially overlapping causes. The term ``forced migration'' is not meant to take a stand in ongoing debates regarding protections under international law and the concept of agency in relation to a distinction between ``forced'' and ``voluntary.''\\28\\ ``Forced migration'' is not used in defiance or to criticize the various terms that have been adopted to describe these populations, but aspires to capture the pressing and diverse needs and realities of those forced to flee their homes today. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ International Organization for Migration (IOM), Glossary on Migration, at 77 (2019). ``While not an international legal concept, this term has been used to describe the movements of refugees, displaced persons (including those displaced by disasters or development projects), and, in some instances, victims of trafficking. At the international level the use of this term is debated because of the widespread recognition that a continuum of agency exists rather than a voluntary/forced dichotomy and that it might undermine the existing legal international protection regime.'' Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Methodology In conducting research for this report, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Staff interviewed dozens of migration and humanitarian experts, analyzed key documents and reports, and carried out research trips to Colombia, Tunisia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Mexico, and Ethiopia. In each country, staff met with U.S. and national, provincial, and municipal government officials, UN and international nongovernmental organization (NGO) representatives, as well as forced migrants and their host communities. In Colombia, staff focused on the plight of Venezuelan refugees, and in Tunisia, staff focused on forced migrants in and traveling through Libya.\\29\\ Egypt is host to Syrian, Palestinian, and African refugees.\\30\\ Bangladesh hosts over 900,000 stateless Rohingya refugees from Burma.\\31\\ Ethiopia is not only one of the largest refugee- hosting countries in Africa, but also has over 3 million IDPs.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ In the absence of a U.S. embassy in Tripoli, the U.S. Libya External Liaison Office is based in Tunis. \\30\\ UNHCR, Egypt Fact Sheet, at 1 (May 2019). \\31\\ UNHCR, Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018, at 22 (June 2019). \\32\\ UNOCHA, Ethiopia Situation Report No. 23, at 1 (June 2019); UNHCR, ``Ethiopia,'' https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/ethiopia.html (last visited June 9, 2020). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary of Report This report provides an analysis of the present global forced migration crisis, the challenges it presents to local communities, national governments, the international system, and to the vulnerable men, women, and children themselves who are forced to migrate. Taken together, these facts represent a clarion call urging for strong leadership, international solidarity, and innovation to reduce the suffering of forced migrants and effectively address the sheer magnitude of the crisis. Chapter One lays out the magnitude of today's global forced migration crisis. Chapter Two explores the global trends catalyzing the forced migration of people and the characteristics of their displacement. Chapter Three examines the systematic denial of forced migrants' fundamental human rights across all phases of their forced migration. Chapter Four outlines international efforts to address forced migration, including diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and international legal frameworks. The chapter also highlights regional and country efforts to more adequately address forced migration, as well as dramatic inconsistencies in country-level responses. Chapter Five details the Trump administration's domestic policies and practices towards forced migrants, with particular attention to refugees and asylum seekers. Chapter Six describes the administration's erosion of U.S. diplomatic engagement and international leadership in addressing forced migration and humanitarian crises. Chapter Seven examines the urgent need for new, innovative solutions as traditional responses have proven inadequate to address the scale and complexity of forced migration today. Finally, the Findings and Recommendations outline necessary actions needed to respond to the current forced migration crisis in order to prevent and mitigate disastrous global effects. Below, we have summarized the principal findings and principal recommendations of this report. More detailed Findings & Recommendations can be found beginning on page 137. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Through expert interviews, observations from the field, and research of current policies and best practices to date, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Staff found the following: The scale of today's forced migration crisis is unprecedented and, if left unaddressed, will grow in size and complexity. A confluence of factors, including persistent climate-related shocks and increasingly frequent, highly violent, and protracted conflicts impacting civilians have resulted in a record number of people forced to flee their homes around the globe. By the end of 2018, there were over 70 million refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs worldwide. Many forced migrants are unable to return home for decades, often live in urban environments in developing countries, and face severe restrictions to and violations of their human rights. The COVID-19 pandemic has only magnified the extreme vulnerabilities of forced migrant populations, highlighted by dangerously overcrowded settings and inadequate access to basic healthcare. The international community has struggled to address drivers of forced migration and support the growing number of forced migrants worldwide. Armed actors have increasingly failed to adhere to international law, attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure, and interfering with humanitarian aid with impunity. The UN Security Council, largely due to vetoes by its permanent members, has struggled to uphold its core mandate of maintaining peace and security, and has failed to hold violators of international law accountable. Despite specific international legal conventions affording refugees protection, some countries have denied refugees basic rights and services. The situation is often much worse for those without pathways for national and international protection, including IDPs and those displaced by severe climate-related events. The United States' retreat from humanitarian obligations and international cooperation under the Trump administration has dealt a grave blow to the international system. The United States has historically served as a global leader in humanitarian response, humanitarian diplomacy, and refugee resettlement. The Trump administration, by contrast, has used every mechanism at its disposal to block legal pathways for refuge, undermining longstanding U.S. policies. As global need continues to grow, major donors such as the United States have reduced humanitarian financing, and the scale of need is far outpacing available assistance. Furthermore, the United States' regressive leadership has emboldened other countries to abandon their responsibilities to protect refugees and other forced migrants, and has impaired an already-weakened system of international cooperation for responding to global crises like forced migration. A dramatic change in course is needed to address the drivers of forced migration and adequately meet the needs of today's forced migrants. Recent efforts in humanitarian financing, aid, diplomacy, and the private sector highlight opportunities to reinvigorate forced migration responses, although greater support is needed to drive these innovations. These initiatives include new international and national compacts on refugees, the World Bank's concessional financing, and a myriad of private partnerships aimed at providing services and opportunities to forced migrants. Given the scale of today's forced migration crisis, these efforts also underscore a need for collaborative action and widespread rethinking across all sectors--government, finance, and private companies--in order to comprehensively address the crisis. ---------- PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS Forced migration will fuel future destabilization if not addressed and managed appropriately. While President Trump has repeatedly requested severe cuts to the humanitarian assistance budget, Congress has consistently appropriated funds well above the presidential request. The needs, however, remain enormous, and more must be done to increase resources, encourage innovation, empower policy leadership, and address root causes diplomatically. To these ends, this report recommends the following actions be undertaken by Congress, the Executive Branch, and the United Nations: The United States Government must reinvigorate efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and resolve conflict, a primary driver of forced migration. Congress should authorize the expanded use of sanctions and other tools against perpetrators of international humanitarian law violations and those who deny aid access for life-saving assistance. The Executive Branch, including the Departments of State and Defense, should ensure U.S. military assistance, such as arms sales, military training, and other defense services, is contingent on the implementation of civilian harm mitigation policies and adherence to international humanitarian law. The United States must pursue protection for all forced migrants worldwide. Both Congress and the Executive Branch must ensure that protections afforded to refugees, IDPs, and other forced migrants by international and national laws are upheld within, at, and outside our borders. Congress should mandate regular reports from the State Department and USAID on the rights and situations of forced migrant populations, including refugees and IDPs. The United States must reform and improve upon domestic efforts to address forced migration by restoring the U.S. refugee resettlement program and creating complementary pathways for protection. Harmful Trump administration policies towards forced migrants, including the Remain in Mexico policy and ``safe third country'' agreements, must be terminated. Both Congress and the Executive Branch must take steps to ensure that the U.S. refugee ceiling is increased in line with global need. Both branches should also work to expand our understanding of U.S. refugee law based on current realities and create complementary pathways to protect other forced migrant populations. By reclaiming our reputation as a place of refuge, the United States can lead on securing global solutions. The United States must promote global cooperation efforts to address the forced migration crisis. The Executive Branch should join the Global Compact for Refugees, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration, and the Paris Climate Agreement. Reinvigorating the momentum behind the 2016 New York Declaration, the United States should lead efforts convening host governments, donors, the private sector, civil society, and forced migrant representatives to form a new compact supporting the inclusion of forced migrant populations in host countries. The United Nations should take further action to enforce international humanitarian law and improve protections for forced migrants. The UN's role in responding to and alleviating the forced migration crisis has never been more important. The UN must use its tools, including Boards of Inquiry, Commissions of Inquiry, and the International Court of Justice, to enforce international law and end rampant impunity, including by publishing findings and identifying perpetrators of violations of international law. The UN Secretary- General should call on host countries to incorporate forced migrant populations into their national action plans. Moreover, the UN Secretary-General should promote awareness and renewed responses for IDP populations by elevating the role of Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of IDPs to Special Representative on IDPs and encouraging the implementation and ratification of the UN's Guiding Principles on International Displacement.

CHAPTER ONE The Scale of Today's Forced Migration Crisis ---------- While forced migration is not a new phenomenon, the magnitude and complexity of today's global forced migration crisis is unprecedented.\\33\\ Media images and daily news from all over the world shed light on the plight of desperate civilians on the move. The haunting photo of a drowned three- year old Syrian boy on the beach in Turkey.\\34\\ Reports of mass rape, executions, torture, and burning villages in Burma, driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from their homes.\\35\\ These are just snapshots in time. To properly understand the scale of today's forced migration crisis, the overarching facts and figures need to be laid bare: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ There is some debate over whether the number of forced migrants today is truly ``unprecedented'' given there has not been accurate global data collected on forced migration for much of the world's history. In addition to its scale, however, the current crisis is unprecedented due to the protracted nature of displacement, the atrocities driving displacement, and the incredibly vulnerable situations of forced migrants. See Benjamin Thomas White, ``Talk of an `unprecedented' number of refugees is wrong--and dangerous,'' The New Humanitarian, Oct. 3, 2019; Elizabeth Ferris, ``Unpacking the numbers on global refugees,'' Brookings Institution, June 20, 2017; UN News Services, ``UN, humanitarian community struggling to meet unprecedented needs of refugees,'' Oct. 5, 2015; See also Chapters 2 and 3 for further details. \\34\\ See Diane Cole, ``Study: What Was The Impact Of The Iconic Photo Of The Syrian Boy?,'' NPR, Jan. 13, 2017. \\35\\ See, e.g., ``Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know about the crisis,'' BBC, Jan. 23, 2020; Human Rights Watch, ``Rohingya Crisis,'' https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya-crisis (last visited May 27, 2020).

Just a handful of crises have caused massive forced migration, and their effects are felt far beyond their borders. Violence in Burma, Syria, South Sudan, and Venezuela has generated massive spillover effects to neighboring countries.\\43\\ As these contexts have also demonstrated, significant surges in forced migration can exacerbate fragile situations in impacted countries and destabilize entire regions.\\44\\ Many such countries are not prepared for large influxes of forced migrants and are unable to meet basic humanitarian needs.\\45\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ See ``MSF estimates more than 6,700 Rohingya killed in Myanmar,'' BBC, Dec. 14, 2017; UNHCR, ``Operational Portal: South Sudan,'' https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/southsudan (last visited May 27, 2020); UNHCR, ``Syria emergency,'' https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/ syria-emergency.html (last visited May 27, 2020); Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, ``Response for Venezuelans,'' https://r4v.info/ en/situations/platform (last visited May 27, 2020). \\44\\ Uri Dadush & Mona Niebuhr, ``The Economic Impact of Forced Migration,'' Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Apr. 22, 2016. \\45\\ Susan Fratzke & Camille Le Coz, Strengthening Refugee Protection in Low-and Middle-Income Countries, Migration Policy Institute (Feb. 2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An exhaustive review of ongoing conflicts and humanitarian emergencies is not necessary to begin appreciating the horrors that civilians experience in times of crisis. Still, it is worthwhile to outline some contemporary examples of conflict-- resulting in forced migration populations Committee staff met with in-person--that continue to challenge the humanitarian community and the existing political and legal frameworks intended to support vulnerable forced migrants. Burma: In August 2017, a brutal military campaign in Rakhine, Burma triggered the flight of an estimated 745,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh, including more than 400,000 children.\\46\\ In Burma, entire villages were burned to the ground, thousands were killed, families were separated, and women and girls were raped. The massive influx of refugees quickly overwhelmed Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh and led to the growth of the world's largest refugee camp.\\47\\ Prior to the crisis in 2017, thousands of Rohingya refugees already resided in this region of Bangladesh after fleeing earlier episodes of violence and, to this day, the root causes for their flight from Rakhine, Burma have not been resolved.\\48\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ UNOCHA, ``Rohingya Refugee Crisis,'' https://www.unocha.org/ rohingya-refugee-crisis (last visited June 8, 2020). \\47\\ Id.; ``Former UN Chief Says Bangladesh Cannot Continue Hosting Rohingya,'' Al Jazeera, July 10, 2019. \\48\\ Medecins Sans Frontieres, ``Timeline: A Visual History of the Rohingya Refugee Crisis,'' Aug. 23, 2019. Syria: Since the conflict in Syria began in 2011, more than half of Syria's population of 21 million has been displaced, including 6.6 million who are internally displaced and 5.6 million refugees who fled to and are still residing in neighboring countries.\\49\\ At least 13 million who remain inside Syria need basic humanitarian assistance.\\50\\ In 2018, an average 4,477 civilians were displaced each day, a figure which increased dramatically in early 2020 during the military offensive in northwest Syria, when nearly one million people were displaced within three months.\\51\\ From December 2019 to February 2020, more than 11,000 Syrians were displaced from their homes each day.\\52\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ UNHCR, ``Syria emergency,'' https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/syria- emergency.html (last visited June 8, 2020); World Bank, ``Population, total--Syrian Arab Republic,'' https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ SP.POP.TOTL?locations=SY (last visited June 8, 2020). \\50\\ UNHCR, ``Syria Emergency,'' https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/syria- emergency.html (last visited June 8, 2020). \\51\\ UNOCHA, ``Humanitarian Needs Overview 2019,'' https://hno- syria.org/#key-figures (last visited May 27, 2020); UNOCHA, Syrian Arab Republic: Recent Developments in Northwest Syria (Mar. 5, 2020). \\52\\ `` `A horrifying new level': UN says 900,000 displaced in Northwest Syria since December,'' France24, Feb. 17, 2020.

CHAPTER TWO Trends in Forced Migration ---------- Today, more men, women, and children are forced to flee their homes than ever before. Conflicts across the globe have increased in frequency and intensity. Furthermore, the rise of non-state armed actors like terrorists and violent gangs, urban conflict, restrictions on humanitarian access, violations of international humanitarian law, and climate change have exacerbated migration trends and complicated the international community's ability to respond. New trends, such as protracted displacement and urbanization, have challenged many of the available tools to support forced migrants. As these developments continue, protecting the human rights and meeting the basic needs of forced migrant populations will be increasingly challenging. Why More People Are Fleeing: The Changing Nature of Conflict & Violence Libya. South Sudan. Cameroon. Syria. Democratic Republic of Congo. Burma. Mali. The list of countries plagued by conflict goes on and on. The number of conflicts occurring worldwide is more than 60 percent greater than it was a decade ago.\\61\\ The characteristics of conflict have changed as well--conflicts last longer, are more likely to be within states rather than between states, are increasingly urban, and are more frequently involving non-state actors. These changes have taken place amidst major socio-economic and political changes around the globe, including a rise in populist nationalist governments, a weakened United Nations (UN) Security Council, and the absence of a single superpower willing to call for principled action. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\61\\ Emma Samman et al., SDG Progress: Fragility, crisis and leaving no one behind, Overseas Development Institute, at 13 (Sept. 2018). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2019, conflict remained the primary driver of global humanitarian need.\\62\\ By the end of 2018, at least 70.8 million people were forcibly displaced, primarily due to conflict and generalized violence, as well as persecution and human rights violations.\\63\\ Around 30 million children were displaced by conflict alone.\\64\\ These figures are the highest on record and represent dramatic increases over the past decade.\\65\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ UNOCHA, Global Humanitarian Overview 2019, at 5-6 (2019). \\63\\ UNHCR, Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018, at 2-3 (June 2019); Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), Global Report on Internal Displacement 2019 Summary, at 6 (May 2019). \\64\\ Press Release, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Around 30 million children displaced by conflict need protection now and sustainable solutions over the long term, June 20, 2018. \\65\\ UNHCR, Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018, at 5 (June 2019); UNHCR, 2008 Global Trends: Refugees, Asylum-seekers, Returnees, Internally Displaced and Stateless Persons, at 2 (June 16, 2009). UNHCR identified 42 million forcibly displaced persons at the end of 2008 compared to over 70 million in 2018. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Increasingly Frequent & Prolonged Conflicts In 2013, there were 34 active conflicts globally.\\66\\ Just five years later, in 2018, there were 52.\\67\\ The world is not only seeing more outbreaks of conflict, but also conflicts that last longer than ever before. From 1990 to 2013, the average length of conflict nearly doubled--from 19 to 37 years.\\68\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\66\\ Scott Gates et al., Trends in Armed Conflict, 1946-2014, Peace Research Institute Oslo, at 2 (2016). \\67\\ Harvard Strand et al., Trends in Armed Conflict, 1946-2018, Peace Research Institute Oslo, at 2 (2019). \\68\\ Christina Bennett et al., Time to let go: Remaking humanitarian action for the modern era, Overseas Development Institute, at 29 (Apr. 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Today, conflict is the main driver of humanitarian need-- accounting for 80 percent of global humanitarian assistance-- whereas ten years ago, the same percentage of humanitarian assistance went to victims of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods.\\69\\ In 2019, the UN estimated that just six conflict-driven humanitarian emergencies would be responsible for more than half of all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection: Yemen, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Sudan.\\70\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\69\\ Statement of Nancy Lindborg, President of the United States Institute of Peace, Hearing on Flashing Red: The State of Global Humanitarian Affairs, Hearing before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mar. 22, 2017, at 5. \\70\\ UNOCHA, Global Humanitarian Overview 2019, at 4-5, 26 (2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Non-Traditional Warring Parties & Proxy Warfare The characteristics of contemporary armed conflicts are vastly different from traditional wars. First, the parties to conflict have changed--they are more likely to be non-state actors, such as ethnic and religious groups, terrorist organizations, and criminal enterprises.\\71\\ These parties increasingly target civilian populations to further their political ambitions, create chaos to destabilize governments, and generally assert power.\\72\\ From gangs in Central America to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, civilians increasingly flee from persecution and violence resulting from these groups' brutal tactics to conquer territory and assert control over the populace.\\73\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\71\\ Harvard Strand et al., Trends in Armed Conflict, 1946-2018, Peace Research Institute Oslo, at 2 (2019). \\72\\ United Nations Security Council, Report of the Secretary General: Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict, at 6 (2019). \\73\\ David James Cantor & Malte Plewa, Forced displacement and violent crime: a humanitarian crisis in Central America?, Overseas Development Institute (June 2017); International Crisis Group,`Averting an ISIS Resurgence in Iraq and Syria, at 14 (Oct. 2019).' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accordingly, conflicts are increasingly within countries (intrastate) as opposed to between countries (interstate).\\74\\ However, the rise of great power competition has led to increased proxy warfare and internationalized civil conflict, where external actors are involved in intrastate conflicts.\\75\\ Over the past decade, internationalized civil conflict has grown to make up almost 40 percent of conflicts today.\\76\\ In Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya, the influx of material support from external powers has increased the lethality and duration of these conflicts.\\77\\ Furthermore, external nations' military support has weakened the effectiveness of humanitarian diplomacy and relief. In the case of Yemen, the United States is uniquely positioned to be a force for de-escalation in the conflict, but humanitarian diplomacy efforts have been undermined by U.S. military support for one side of the conflict.\\78\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\74\\ Harvard Strand et al., Trends in Armed Conflict, 1946-2018, Peace Research Institute Oslo, at 2 (2019). \\75\\ ``Proxy war,'' Cambridge Dictionary (2011).

In Central America, for instance, the recent surge of displacement due to violence and insecurity has reached levels not seen since the 1980s, when the region was suffering from widespread armed conflict.\\79\\ The violence--largely perpetrated by organized gangs--is targeted against civilians and is more deadly than many conflicts taking place across the globe, leaving millions in need of basic humanitarian assistance.\\80\\ However, generally this type of violence is not officially recognized under international humanitarian law (the International Committee of the Red Cross categorizes it as ``other situations of violence''), and challenges traditional criteria for refugee status and international protection.\\81\\ Nevertheless, the rapidly growing number of individuals from the region who are considered asylum seekers and refugees underscores the urgent need to address this trend.\\82\\ As of June 2020, there were 400,200 recognized refugees and asylum seekers from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras--a figure increasing at an annual rate of 13 percent.\\83\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\79\\ Nora Sturm, ``UNHCR calls for urgent action as Central America asylum claims soar,'' UNHCR News, Apr. 5, 2016. \\80\\ Press Release, Norwegian Refugee Council et al., A Regional Humanitarian Response Plan for an Intensifying Humanitarian Crisis in the North of Central America, June 28, 2019. \\81\\ Marguerite Cawley, ``Is Central America's Gang Violence A Humanitarians Crisis?,'' Insight Crime, July 18, 2014; International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Characteristics of Armed Conflicts & Other Situations of Violence (Oct. 2017). \\82\\ UNHCR, ``Displacement in Central America,'' https:// www.unhcr.org/en-us/displacement-in-central-america.html (last visited June 5, 2020). \\83\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Urbanization of Conflict The rise of urban warfare in places like Syria, Yemen, and Libya presents a complex set of challenges for the humanitarian community.
