        "text": "In the midst of the booming creator economy, we often celebrate how creators have harnessed their passions and garnered dedicated followings. It's incredible to watch them empower one another and showcase their talents, insights and experiences. Yet, in this celebration, an unconventional thought arises‚Äîare we fully tapping into the symbiotic potential between founders and creators? Creators are skillful storytellers, architects of engagement, and masters of building personal connections. On the flip side, founders hold the keys to business fundamentals, operational grit, and scaling expertise. There is a plethora of knowledge available for mutual exchange. Creators can benefit from embracing proven business strategies, while founders can gain by embodying creators' authenticity and sense of community. Are we already witnessing this collaborative growth? If so, drop some stories below! ‚¨áÔ∏è If not, how can we ignite this sharing of expertise? Which skills do you believe creators can exchange with founders, and vice versa?

Meanwhile, the practical business of running a sustainable and profitable enterprise is largely left to creators to figure out for themselves. Independent research shows that revealing that 73% of creators want fast-track, affordable access to business coaches and consultancy, while half of all creators also want to attend creator-centric events. Today Billion Dollar Boy is launching FiveTwoNine, The Creator Club, a private membership community empowering creators in the business of being a creator. FiveTwoNine operates as a global platform providing educational resources and as physical spaces for key stakeholders in the creator economy to network and collaborate. Our London flagship opens in May 2024, with a New York branch coming soon. The name 'FiveTwoNine' represents those early morning or late night hours that many creators dedicate to pursuing their passions outside of their traditional 9-to-5 jobs. Launching with the help of LIPTON Teas and Infusions and incredible creator entrepreneurs including Lucy Edwards, BOSH! by Henry Firth & Ian Theasby, Joshua Temple - Slogo, Sophie Butler, Jack Henderson, Emanuel Wallace -Big Manny, the funding model is designed to optimise price fairness for increased creator accessibility. FiveTwoNine walks the talk on supporting the lifeblood of the creator economy to help make their businesses a lasting success. Huge congratulations to Becky Owen and Sophie Crowther for leading the charge on a venture that's been over a year in the making.

Our goal is to change the existing media landscape for independent creative professionals into something that works better for the people making what we watch, read, listen to, and enjoy. This came into being after years at Meta, Google and Atavist, working on media products for people creating so they can continue to make and ultimately profit from the work they put online. While there's been an explosion of creative storytelling, the prospects for the vast majority of individual creators to survive independently have never been murkier. Despite the attention that platform funds or conveniently named trends like #creatoreconomy receive, the reality is more complicated for both the individuals and organizations creating our #media. And while the tools we‚Äôre talking about are different, this is a media industry story as old as our modern media landscape ‚Äì even as far back as Hollywood in the 1920s. Like today, a few large companies controlled most of the creative output and exerted enormous control over the individuals who made that work. The companies have changed (but not entirely) and the forms of media have changed (but not entirely) but we are once again in a situation in which a dominant few control the creative potential of so many. One answer that emerged a hundred years ago was that the four most famous people in the world at the time ‚Äì Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, DW Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks ‚Äì created United Artists, fueled by a frustration with this level of control by the studios. These first movie stars hoped this enterprise owned and controlled by its creators would guarantee them both artistic control and sustainable economics. It was a declaration of independence by the most creative people in America. Inspired by this, Artnership enables connection and collaboration between people who create professionally. Our mission is to enable this enormous group to find one another, work together better, and forge new possibilities for collaboration and creativity. From supportive conversations to creative co-production to a re-imagining of what media companies can be. Our site www.artnership.co is now live in preparation for the first product to launch in the coming weeks. If you‚Äôre a #writer, a #podcaster, a #creator, a #YouTuber, #Tiktoker, or whatever you call yourself when you‚Äôre creating something, sign up and follow along to learn more. We‚Äôre starting to accept a small group to test prior to launch. If you have thoughts or questions, please reach out! We‚Äôd love to talk.\n\nimagine trying to launch something out of thin air - talk about a wild ride! in a sea of competitive talent agencies all singing the same tune, it seems like everyone's playing copycat. --who says we can't shake things up? according to a recent scoop from CreatorIQ, creators are itching to break free from quick transactional deals and dive into long-lasting partnerships. a fresh wave is coming, promising to open up a whole new world of opportunities for creators, brands, and operators ready to bring more value to creators. (no more red ocean) the secret sauce? helping creators shape their brands or even snap up existing businesses. (boomers are ready to retire) sure, there are a few trailblazers like Prime Drink and Feastibles out there, but we're just scratching the surface of what could be if more dreamers had a chance to chat with the right folks. this is the gap I want to bridge.\n\nüåü Inspiring Women Taking Their Seats at the Table üåü Not sure why this hasn't been posted everywhere (it should be in a lot more media outlets), because its more than worth celebrating! üöÄ Breaking Barriers and Leading the Way üöÄ We're thrilled to share a remarkable article from Variety highlighting the incredible achievements of Eunice Kim and Elizabeth Stone at Netflix. These phenomenal women are not just taking their seats at the table, but they're leading the way in the tech industry. üí™ ‚úÖ Why is this important? ü§î Did you know that women make up only around 27% of the tech workforce, and women of color represent an even smaller fraction of leadership positions? The tech industry has been lacking in diversity for far too long. Eunice and Elizabeth's journey to the top is an inspiration to us all. They've overcome challenges, shattered glass ceilings, and paved the way for more women and women of color to excel in tech. It's a powerful reminder that representation matters, and it's a testament to their resilience and determination. ‚úÖ Key Takeaways: üìö üåü The Power of Mentorship: Both Eunice and Elizabeth credit their success to having mentors who guided them along the way. Mentorship is not just valuable; it's essential. Seek out mentors who can help you navigate your career path. üåü Continuous Growth: They didn't stop learning and growing. In the tech industry, staying curious and adapting to change is key. Embrace lifelong learning to stay ahead. üåü Embrace Challenges: Both women faced challenges, but they didn't let them deter their ambition. Challenges are opportunities for growth. Embrace them fearlessly. ‚úÖ How Can We Leverage Their Success? üåç Let's take inspiration from Eunice Kim and Elizabeth Stone's journey and use it as a catalyst for our own success. Share this article with others, especially young women of color interested in tech. Mentorship is vital and supporting one another is the key to breaking down barriers.
