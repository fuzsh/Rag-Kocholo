        "text": "Location scouts are always interesting, but yesterday’s VIP tour of iconic Fenway Park was a ‘monster’ of a time. Ten-year-old fanboy Tim would be ‘green’ with envy, let me tell you. ⚾ Bad puns aside, I tell people all the time that a career in video marketing is second to none because most days, it’s like having an all-access, unfiltered, behind-the-scenes pass into the inner workings of industry masters. Just like Dorothy in the Land of Oz, we get to peek behind the curtain and witness how innovations are concocted, technologies are forged, and champions are bred. We're in the board room, the locker room, and everywhere in between… Capturing the essence of brand journeys Telling the stories of leaders shaping our future Showcasing the human side of corporate giants In what other career field do you get to hang with the C-Suite, brainstorm with visionaries, and be a part of strategic brand discussions? Or in the case of yesterday, literally stand in Red Sox manager Alex Cora’s office, stroll along center field, and explore the backstage halls of baseball legends. And the best part? Every day is a new adventure, every project a new creative opportunity. It's more than a job; it's a front-row seat to the world's most exciting stories.\n\nSomething many people don’t know about me is that my role at Riipen isn’t my first role in sales. When I was in college and graduate school I sold meal plans at college freshman orientations! Yep, for three summers, I was the queen of the cafeteria, selling the convenience of campus dining to wide-eyed students and their even wider-eyed parents. Did I love it? You bet your bottom dollar (which, ironically, the meal plan helped me save!). As a four-year meal plan veteran myself, I shared genuine enthusiasm for the product. But beyond that, I thrived on the human connection. Guiding nervous freshmen and their families through the college transition, sharing tips on surviving freshman year, and helping them navigate the expansive campus– it was more than just sales, it was empowerment. Free food all summer? A bonus. The swag? A backpack embroidered with the University of Central Florida logo? Teenage me thought I was living the dream. But the real thrill came from closing deals, exceeding targets, and proving I had a natural talent for connecting with people and understanding their needs. Graduation took me down a different career path in higher education, and those summers spent selling meal plans became a distant, albeit fond, memory. \"Maybe sales would have been cool,\" I'd think occasionally, but the thought quickly faded – surely it was too late to switch gears, right? Wrong. Fast forward a decade, and here I am, two years strong as an Account Executive, selling directly to the higher education sector. Talk about a full circle moment! This role allows me to combine my passion for education with the sales skills I honed in those unexpected summer gigs. It's a perfect blend of my strengths, and a constant reminder that life's path can be delightfully surprising. So, if you're feeling stuck in a career rut, wrestling with the \"what-ifs\" of a different path, take heart! My story is a testament to the fact that it's never too late to take a chance on yourself and pursue your dreams. And hey, if you ever need someone to talk to about navigating a career change, or just want to hear some epic tales of dorm food conquests, feel free to reach out! Thank you Aramark for helping me get my start in sales (and for keeping me fed and fueled on campus)!\n\nI can't think of many more important decisions I made in my life than where I began my career journey. I kicked off as a Saturday lad at JJB Sports, Parkgate, Rotherham. Stacking shelves, stock room runs to grab trainers and the most thrilling part, learning how to use the Football shirt number/name printing machine! - Once in '94 I put \"9 - Shearer\" on the back of a Man Utd home shirt, when he looked nailed on to go there...bet that jersey didn't get much airtime ;-) Anyway, this job set me up with a love for all things retail. I learned how to interact with customers, built communication skills and understood the importance of listening. Ami Rowe and her team create these opportunities across a Global estate for us here at Frasers Group. It genuinely excites and amazes me at how many of these stories we are able to kick-off every single day. If you, your friends, siblings, children even Grandchildren, are looking for a role to kick start something, even just to get a little pocket money; it all starts with an application.
