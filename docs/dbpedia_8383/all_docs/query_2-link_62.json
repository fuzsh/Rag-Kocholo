In the battles that follow, the Daemons of Chaos slaughter their way into the legends of this new realm. Ultimately, Jarl's victory is cheated only by Sigmar's tireless courage and peerless battle-skill, and by the fact that the Chaos Gods grow bored on the very eve of victory, and recall their minions to more exciting conflicts within the Realm of Chaos. As the Dark Brothers cannot agree who has greatest claim on Jarl's black soul, they quarter the traitor; an equal share is thus apportioned to each benefactor.[6a] At the same time there is an invasion by the forces of Chaos led by the all-conquering Morkar.

Always the same, these nightmares have him striding eternally across a blasted and twisted landscape, populated by creatures much like those he had vanquished.

After a long and uneventful siege, the King of Bretonnia treats for peace on behalf of Parravon with Emperor Magnus I.[13c][13d] However, following the Empire's victory, a battalion of Nordlanders are mistakenly attacked by a relief army of over-eager Stirlanders who have heard tales of brightly clothed foreigners with funny accents invading their lands.[10a]\n\nca. 2312 IC - Waaagh!

With the artillery destroyed, the doors of Brass Keep grind open and a tide of frenzied warriors charge out, butchering the Empire's soldiers to a man.[8a]\n\n2371 IC - Gunthar von Bildhofen's granddaughter marries Boris Todbringer, and their son becomes the first Todbringer Graf of Middenheim.[2b]\n\n2378 IC - Marienburg's merchant fleets and militia conduct a highly successful campaign against the pirates.[2b]\n\n2383 IC - Children report visions of Shallya in a grove outside Pfeildorf.

Gutstompa.[6e]\n\n2402-2405 IC - The Duchy of Parravon invades Reikland a second time over Grey Lady Pass. Twice the Bretonnians lay siege to Ubersreik, but it does not fall. The Fourth Parravon War is ended when Dieter IV pays a very large sum of money in return for the Bretonnian retreat.[13d]\n\nca. 2410 IC - In exchange for twelve dozen wagon-loads of gold, Dwarf craftsmen build Fortress Kreighof for the Elector Count of Ostermark. However, when the Dwarfs received their payment, they discover they have been short-changed by a measly two and a half pennies. They return to Kreighof with a sizeable army from Karak Kadrin and raze the fortress to the ground.[10b]\n\n2415 IC - The Night of a Thousand Arcane Duels. Rivalries between the Colleges of Magic turn into outright violence, and for a single night, the sky above Altdorf is lit with fireballs, lightning bolts and multicoloured flashes of light as wizards turn their powers and war machines upon each other. Order is restored after a magical backlash kills six of the eight Patriarchs in a variety of gruesome and horrific ways.[10b] Following this, the Cult of Sigmar pressures Emperor Dieter IV to disestablish the colleges and outlaw wizardry. Eventually, he bows to this pressure.[13d]\n\n2420 IC - The Goblin Warlord Grom the Paunch leads a Waaagh! of Orc and Goblin tribes into the World's Edge Mountains.[2b] The lack of battle wizards is widely blamed for many of the Imperial forces defeats during this campaign.[13d]\n\n2424 IC - After defeating the Dwarfs at the Battle of Iron Gate, Grom's army moves into the Empire. Much of the north and east is devastated and parts of Nuln are burnt to the ground. Grom leads his army to the sea where he builds a huge fleet and sails into the west, never to be seen again in the Old World.[2b]\n\n2429 IC - Marienburg secedes from the Empire after the Burgomeisters collude with Emperor Dieter IV to secure their independence in return for Marienburger gold. When the scandal comes to light, the Electors invoke anti-corruption laws from the era of Magnus the Pious and depose Dieter. Wilhelm III takes the throne. The crown passes to the Elector Counts of Reikland. A daring trio of illusionists attached to a prestigious theatre company staying in the Imperial Palace in Altdorf make off with a fine selection of treasure from Emperor Wilhelm III’s collection. Wilhelm III orders a mass trial for wizards on charges of witchcraft and consorting with Chaos. The Battle of Grootscher Marsh is fought when the Electors pressure the newly-elected Wilhelm to retake Marienburg. In late autumn, battle is engaged, and Empire forces are defeated soundly. After the battle, Wilhelm verbally acknowledges the Wasteland's secession, but he never officially regonized their independence with a treaty. Meanwhile, Duke Frederik turns Tarhelm's Keep into a prison.[2b][13d]\n\n2430 IC - In frustration over his defeat at Grootscher Marsh, Wilhelm III reinstates the Colleges of Magica. Significant resources are also invested in shipbuilding.[13d]\n\n2431 IC - An accident at the newly reestablished Bright College leads to the Great Fire of Altdorf.

The Vloedmuur defences are extended and the drainage system improved.[2b]\n\n2449 IC - In Marienburg, rioting spreads from the Suiddock throughout the city in response to anti-Labour Guild laws passed by the City Council.[2b]\n\n2453 IC - At the Fourth Siege of Altdorf, the Liche King, Arkhan the Black, rides at the head of a vast army of skeletal warriors directly towards the gates of Altdorf. However, the bold frontal assault is a fiendish diversion. As the city's state troops defiantly hold back the Undead legions at Altdorf's walls, Arkhan uses magic to break into the catacombs beneath the Temple of Sigmar and steal the dreaded Liber Mortis. As soon as he escapes with the tome, his army collapses once more, leaving the Empire soldiers standing in bewilderment.[10b][13d]\n\n2457 IC - Egrimm van Horstmann, High Luminary of the College of Light Magic, is finally beguiled by the whispered promises of Tzeentch.

Ricart Drallborg, aspirant wizard of the Gold Order, summons the Daemon-hound to eliminate his rivals. Alas for Drallborg his enchantments cannot cage Karanak and the Gold Wizard is the first to feel the beast's jaws.

Shortly after, King Louen of Bretonnia is granted a vision of prophecy by the Lady of the Lake. He sees the Old World in ruins, with the Ruinous Powers reigning supreme. He understands that Bretonnia needs an equally strong neighbour to form a bulwark against the predations of the Dark Gods. The Empire however, has been left weak, and only stands a chance with Emperor Karl Franz on the throne. Meeting with the King at Axe Bite Pass, Franz is informed of this prophecy. He is told to return to his homeland and secure the throne, not for himself, or for Louen, but for the entire Old World. Shortly after his return to Altdorf, Karl Franz is elected by a close margin and crowned in the High Temple of Sigmar. His first act is to lead an army to aid the Elector Count of Nordland to repel a massive invasion of Norse barbarians. Aided by the wizards and war machines of the Celestial College, Karl Franz predicts where and when the northern marauders plan to attack. With this knowledge, he prepares a well-executed ambush that devastates the Norse forces before they even realise they are under attack. The Emperor personally leads the Reiksguard in the final charge against the Norse shield wall, and in doing so, establishes a reputation as a brilliant and courageous military leader.[10b][13d][18]\n\n2503 IC - The army of Wissenland, led by Karl Franz, allies with a host of Wood Elves to defeat a horde of minotaurs that threatens to cross the Grey Mountains into Athel Loren. A month after this, an Asrai emmissary appears in Altdorf bearing a griffon egg and a message: \"We will be watching.\"[19a]\n\n2505 IC - The Battle of Stuttburg.[12a] Meanwhile, the playwright Detlef Sierck is appointed by the crown to stage an amibitious play in Castle Drachenfels. The performance goes horribly wrong.[13d]\n\n2505 to Present IC - The Emperor dispatches the Reikmarshal, Kurt Helborg, to lead his armies in battle against numerous foes; the Ogre reavers of Gutlord Breaskus, the Orcs of the Blighted Towers and many others. Kurt Helborg leads the Empire's armies to victory after victory, establishing his name as one of the greatest generals and tacticians of his age.[10b]\n\n2507 IC - A severe outbreak of the Dancing Malady afflicts several villages south of the Midden Moors, causing hundreds of peasants to jig madly towards Carroburg. An imperial army led by General von Rau marches out to meet what they believe is a peasant uprising. Only when an impetuous unit of Outriders join the dance do the commanders identify the throng for what it is. A continget of Shallyans from Altdorf, led by Anja Gustavson are immediately sent for. Finally, the priestesses muster enough faith to summon a miracle from Shallya—a white light that instantaneously puts the peasants to sleep. Von Rau, however, believes that the peasants are still tainted by Chaos, and has his army slay them all as they lie.[21a]\n\n2508 IC - Malathrax the Mighty, a massive Doomfire Dragon, terrorises Reikland. Several villages are razed, and the Dragon single-handedly destroys the Knightly Order of the Ebon Sword. Malathrax is tracked down by the Huntsmarshal, Markus Wulfhart, and his regiment of monster hunters, and ambushed whilst resting on the banks of the River Reik. The Dragon is slain before it can reach the opposite river bank after the Huntsmarshal shoots not one, but three arrows through its heart.[10b][13d]\n\n2509 – 2511 IC - Tamurkhan the Maggot Lord, body-thief and favoured of Nurgle, leads a mighty incursion of Chaos in a great scything arc down the Mountains of Mourn and sweeping across the Dark Lands, laying all desolate in his wake. With the Chaos Dwarfs and a horde of nightmarish beasts as his allies, he lays waste to the Border Princes and strikes at the Empire's underbelly.[8a] In ca. 2511, he is finally defeated at the gates of Nuln.[10b]\n\n2512 IC - A scandal involving a Chaos Cult leads to the fall of the house of Teugen in Bögenhafen. Also in this year, a brief civil war that would later be called the Turmoil of 2512 takes place, followed by reorganisation of the Empire and establishment of new Electors and provinces. In addition, Baugard the Rash, of Bretonnia, launches an attack upon the Empire to avenge an insult done to his infamously ugly wife by the visiting Elector Count of Averland, Marius Leitdorf. The short-lived crusade is ended before the walls of Helmgart when the knights are bloodily repulsed by the keep's massed Helblaster Volley Gun batteries.[10b] Meanwhile, a cabal of Chaos Sorcerers in the Middle Mountains summon a horde of Daemons which ravages the Ostland countryside. Captain Octavius Grauff leads a unit of thirty veteran huntsmen to the cabal's cave and assassinates them. The Daemons are thus banished to the Realm of Chaos.[20c]\n\n2512 to 2515 IC - Azhag the Slaughterer leads a huge army of Orcs and Night Goblins into the northern Empire, burning and pillaging vast swathes of land.[10b]\n\n2515 IC - Slaughter at Volganof.

The Emperor asks Balthasar Gelt to intervene on his behalf, and the Supreme Patriarch travels to Nordland's capital of Castle Salzenmund. Though ostensibly there as an ambassador, Gelt secretly transmutes the gold earmarked for Theoderic's armies and mercenaries into worthless bars of lead before returning to Altdorf on the back of a Pegasus. The hired swords refuse to fight without payment and the looming threat of civil war is narrowly averted. In revenge, Thoederic swears he will have Gelt's head.[10c] Meanwhile, the son of Aldebrand Ludenhof, Elector Count of Hochland, falls ill with a mysterious illness. He is treated by a cloaked doctor who instructs him to drink a potion should the symptoms return. Upon drinking the tainted elixir, he is transformed into a hideous mutant that slaughters a dozen of the Count's most trusted advisors before sloping off to the north to obey its new master, Festus the Leechlord.[8a]\n\n2516 to 2517 IC - The Beastlord Graktar is defeated in a challenge by Khazrak who embarks on a series of raids across Drakwald, sacking Jagerhausen, Immelscheld, and Arenburg.[2b]\n\n2517 IC - The Battle of Bones.

The Empire forces, hard pressed to hold back the terrifying hordes, believe they are doomed when a second Undead host approaches from the south to surround them.

In Reikland, Karl Franz personally leads an army into Bloodpine Woods to purge its Forest Goblin threat. At the Battle of Bloodpine Woods, the Empire is victorious and the Spiderclaw Tribe is eradicated.[10b]\n\n2518 IC - Boris Todbringer II purges Drakwald of Beastmen and personally takes the eye of Khazrak at the Battle of Elsterweld.[2b] Meanwhile, the chaos incursion of Grakthor Flameaxe is vanquished by a host of Flagellants led by Grand Theogonist Volkmar himself. At the end of the battle, known as the Martyrs of Taalfjord, only Volkmar and a score of flagellants are left standing.[10b]\n\n2519 IC - Khazrak takes out Todbringer's right eye in an ambush outside Norderingen. The Count offers a 10,000-crown reward on Khazrak's head.[2b] Meanwhile, the Battle of Six Spikes is won when Balthasar Gelt harnesses the rampant Storm of Magic to turn the entire Chaos army into a forest of golden statues.[10b]\n\n2520 IC - The Third Battle of Black Fire Pass, and the Siege of Middendorf. Festus the Leechlord continues to blight the Empire with his dark experiments, unleashing a strain of Eyeslime Fever so virulent that the death it causes allows a horde of Daemons to manifest within the Empire, laying siege to the city of Middendorf. However, the defenders are rallied to victory by Luthor Huss.[8a][10b] Meanwhile, Baron Otto Krieglitz leads a mercenary army to reclaim his ancestral castle in the Black Mountains from Greenskins. He is initially successful, but his army hasn't been seen since its first battle.[20d]\n\n2521 IC - The Imperial School of Engineers claim that their ingenuity surpasses that of their Dwarf allies, leading to raging arguments. The resultant \"field testing contest\" escalates when each side decides to demonstrate their superiority in the field of counter-battery fire. Before long the air is filled with silvered shot, runic cannonballs, flaming naptha and helstorm rockets, whilst exploding flying machines and clockwork angels duel with steel zeppelins and Gyrocopter squadrons in the skies above.[15a]\n\nStorm of Chaos[]\n\n2521 – 2522 IC - United by the Lord of the End Times, Archaon, marauders from the Chaos Wastes pour southwards in ever greater numbers. Luthor Huss discovers the youth Valten and claims he is Sigmar Reborn. Emperor Karl Franz convenes the Conclave of Light to discuss the growing threat from the north. Dubbed the Storm of Chaos, the northmen invasion sweeps through Kislev and into the Empire. Huss and Valten meet Karl Franz. The Emperor gifts Valten with Ghal-Maraz and dubs him the Champion of Sigmar, but retains rule of the Empire. Archaon is intent on defiling the Flame of Ulric in Middenheim. The combined forces of Middenland, Ostland, and Hochland slow the attack. A force led by Karl Franz containing Teclis and Valten drives the remnants of Archaon's force from Middenheim. Valten is grievously wounded in the fighting. After the defeat of the Chaos horde, the Empire is riven by a religious schism. Valten is initially found murdered in the Temple of Shallya, but his body disappears. It is claimed that he will return again when he is needed.[2b]\n\nSources[]\n\n1: Warhammer Armies: Empire (4th Edition)\n\n1a: pg. 11\n\n2: Warhammer Fantasy RPG 2nd Edition - Sigmar's Heirs (RPG)\n\n2a: pg. 20\n\n2b: pg. 21\n\n2c: pg. 14\n\n2d: pg. 102\n\n3: Warhammer Armies: Empire (7th Edition)\n\n3a: pg. 203\n\n4: Warhammer Armies: Vampire Counts (7th Edition)\n\n4a: pg. 17\n\n5: Warhammer Fantasy Armies: Core (7th Edition)\n\n5a: pg. 207\n\n6: Warhammer Armies: Daemons of Chaos (8th Edition)\n\n6a: pg. 17\n\n6b: pg. 18\n\n6c: pg. 19\n\n6d: pg. 21\n\n6e: pg. 22\n\n6f: pg. 23\n\n7: Warhammer Fantasy RPG 2nd Edition - Shades of the Empire\n\n7a: pg. 114\n\n8: Warhammer Armies: Warriors of Chaos (8th Edition)\n\n8a: pg. 15\n\n9: Warhammer Armies: Tomb Kings (8th Edition)\n\n9a: pg. 21\n\n9b: pg. 59\n\n10: Warhammer Armies: Empire (8th Edition)\n\n10a: pg. 16\n\n10b: pg. 17\n\n10c: pg. 33\n\n11: Knight of the Blazing Sun (Novel) by Josh Reynolds\n\n11a: ch. 2\n\n12: White Dwarf #243 (US)\n\n12a: pg. 31\n\n13: Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition: Core Rulebook (RPG)\n\n13a: pg. 272\n\n13b: pg. 273\n\n13c: pg. 274\n\n13d: pg. 275\n\n14: Time of Legends: Empire (Novel) by Graham McNeill\n\n14a: Chapter 11: \"The Mountains of Fear\"\n\n14b: Chapter 13: \"A Warning Unheeded\"\n\n15: Warhammer Core Rulebook (8th Edition)\n\n15a: pg. 177\n\n16: Dead Winter (Novel) by ca.
