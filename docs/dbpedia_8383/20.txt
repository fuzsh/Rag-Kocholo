The Amsterdam publishing house Allert de Lange established an independent German-language department in 1933 on the initiative of journalist Hilda van Praag-Sanders. The German-language department, along with Querido Verlag, was one of the preeminent publishers of German exile literature in the Netherlands. Walter Landauer and Hermann Kesten led the department.

Allert de Lange published, among others, Bertolt Brecht, Max Brod, Sigmund Freud, Siegfried Kracauer and Stefan Zweig. Unlike Querido, Allert de Lange made efforts to avoid direct political confrontation with the Nazi regime, although the publishing house was still liquidated after the German invasion of the Netherlands.

Both Kesten and Landauer had emigrated from Germany after the Machtergreifung. During the German invasion of the Netherlands, Kesten was in France and was able to escape to the United States. Landauer was captured attempting to flee to Switzerland and was interned at Bergen-Belsen, where he was murdered.
