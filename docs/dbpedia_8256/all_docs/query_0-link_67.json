        "text": "By Since66\n\nJune 12 2011\n\nThe final part of season 2010/11 review sees Chelsea travel to Liverpool, hardly a happy hunting ground. Chelsea lost to two Fernando Torres goals, then a hard fought 1-0 victory over neighbours Fulham followed a few days later and then the very next next day, assistant coach Ray Wilkins was dramatically sacked.\n\nWilkins was in attendance at Cobham watching the reserves alongside Ancelotti. At half-time he disappeared and never returned.\n\nHis departure caused a dramatic collapse in Chelsea fortunes.\n\nInjuries and illness to key players - JT, Super Frank, Essien, Alex, Benayoun, Drogba etc - didn't help Chelsea's cause and by the the beginning of January, Chelsea had slipped right out of the title race and into 5th place.\n\nChelsea produced their worst home performance for many a year losing 3-0 to Sunderland. The following week, another defeat against Birmingham, 1-0.\n\nThree 1-1 draws against Newcastle, Everton and Tottenham followed, before Chelsea travelled back to North London only to get 'bashed' by Arsenal, 3-1.\n\nChelsea's only league win in December was another difficult 1-0 at home to Bolton.\n\nChelsea's terrible run also included a 1-0 defeat to Marseille in the final round of group games in the Champions League.\n\nThe beginning of January didn't fair any better.\n\nMore points were dropped: 3-3 at home to Villa described as 'excellent s**t' by my boss and then Chelsea were shockingly beaten away at Wolves, 1-0.\n\nChelsea began their defence of the FA Cup with a comprehensive 7-0 defeat of Ipswich Town. By the middle of February, Chelsea were out of the competition beaten on penalties by Everton in a Stamford Bridge replay, after the hard work was completed at Goodison Park, three weeks before in a 1-1 draw.\n\nThe end of January saw two new signings: Fernando Torres and David Luiz and it was Luiz who made the immediate impact scoring against Man Utd in the 2-1 win at The Bridge, followed quickly by another goal against Money Citeh as Chelsea won 2-0.\n\nTorres, unfortunately struggled to live up to his Â£50m price tag. His only goal came against West Ham in April.\n\nWins against Blackburn and Bolton gave hope that Chelsea were on the way, but a 1-0 defeat at home to Liverpool (on Torres' poor debut), reduced the optimism amongst the faithful.\n\nLuiz immediate impact began with conceding a penalty in the 0-0 draw at Craven Cottage in one of three league games that saw Chelsea win one, lose one and draw one.\n\nAt the end of February Chelsea were stilll in fifth place.\n\nThe Champions League resumed after the winter break and Chelsea took full advantage of FC Copenhagen's lack of match practice, beating the Danes at the Bridge 2-0 - Anelka scoring both goals.\n\nMarch proved to be more profitable - three league wins from three - Man Utd 2-1, Blackpool 3-1 and Money Citeh 2-0, putting Chelsea into third place.\n\nThe Champions League 2nd leg against FC Copenhagen ended 0-0 and then Chelsea were drawn against Man Utd in the quarter-finals.\n\nApril was a busy month. Eight games in total. The month began with a 1-1 draw away to Stoke, then came Man Utd in the Champions League 1st leg at The Bridge, Man Utd winning 1-0.\n\nWigan were next on the agenda. There was to be no repeat of the previous two meetings goal-fest as Chelsea struggled to win 1-0.\n\nThe Champions League campaign came to an end for the season as Chelsea lost 2-1 at Old Trafford in the 2nd leg, 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nStill as I always say not only do Chelsea have to beat the teams put in front of them, they have to beat UEFA. Fortunately both games past without major controversey.\n\nWith the League just about in touching distance Chelsea won four games on the spin beating WBA 3-1, Birmingham City 3-1, West Ham 3-0 and Tottenham 2-1 - scoring eleven goals, conceding only three.\n\nA win at Old Trafford would put Chelsea in pole position for the title.\n\nToo much, too little, too late and a David Luiz mistake inside 30 seconds put Chelsea on the back foot in an extremely disappointing performance which saw the Champions elect win 2-1.\n\nWith 2nd place and Champions League qualification secured for next season, Chelsea's season fizzled out with two more disappointing displays and results - Newcastle at The Bridge finished 2-2 (Newcastle equalising in the dying seconds) and a defeat at Goodison Park against Everton (Chelsea's new nemesis), 1-0.\n\nNo sooner had the final whistle blew at Goodison Park, those in control at The Bridge decided to Carlo Ancelotti's time at The Bridge.\n\nStill there was time for silverware to arrive at The Bridge.\n\nThe reserves won the Barclays Reserves Premier League South, overhauling Arsenal at the top and then in the National Play-Off, the reserves beat Blackburn Rovers.\n\nHere's to season 2011/12.\n\nKTBFFH"
