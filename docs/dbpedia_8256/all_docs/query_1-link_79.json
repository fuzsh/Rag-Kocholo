        "text": "FC Barcelona and Arsenal FC have reached an agreement for the transfer of Belgian player Thomas Vermaelen. He joins the Catalans on a five-year deal after Arsenal accepted a ¤19m bid from the Catalan giants.\n\nHe has been at the Gunners for six seasons, but came up through the ranks at Ajax Amsterdam, as well as spending one year on loan to RKC Waalwijk.\n\nThe 28-year-old's arrival will be a boon to Luis Enrique, who had asked for another centre-back to be recruited to compete with Gerard Piqué, Jérémy Mathieu and Marc Bartra.\n\nVermaelen has already posed in his new shirt and will put pen to paper on Sunday at around 11:30 am at the Camp Nou, after which he will be unveiled out on the pitch.\n\nBarça put the former Arsenal and Ajax captain through an exhaustive medical prior to rubber-stamping the deal, as the defender has been plagued by injuries throughout his career and the 'Azulgranas' were keen to avoid getting their fingers burnt.\n\nLast season alone Vermaelen was sidelined twice. First he suffered a stress fracture to his lower back which forced him to miss the Gunners' pre-season preparations and the first five competitive games of the campaign, and then a knee injury sustained in January kept him out for a further two months.\n\nOn top of that, two years ago the Belgian underwent Achilles surgery in an attempt to resolve a niggling issue that he had been carrying for over a year, on account of which he had sat out over six months of the 2010-11 season.\n\nThomas Vermaelen is a natural leader who has already captained both Ajax and Arsenal despite being a relative youngster. He plays at centre back, and as well as having an impressive physique he is excellent with the ball at his feet and reads the game well. He turned pro at Ajax when he was just 19, and after winning several major honours in Holland, he then made the move to the English Premiership."
