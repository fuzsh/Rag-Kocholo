        "text": "Vice Chairman\n\nJosh Kroenke begins his 11th season as team President/Governor for the Denver Nuggets and Governor of the Avalanche, as he was named to those positions in the summer of 2010. He assumed the additional title of Avalanche team President in 2013, making the upcoming 2020-21 campaign his eighth in that role. Kroenke was also promoted to Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment in the summer of 2018.\n\nOver the past several seasons, Kroenke has ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey. The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core in 2013 by hiring first-year General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly (now President of Basketball Operations) and in 2015 Kroenke and Connelly hired Michael Malone to be the franchise's new head coach who finished third in the NBA Coach of the Year voting in 2018-19. The summer of 2017 saw Kroenke and company land one of the largest free agents in the organization's history by inking four-time All-Star Paul Millsap to a multi-year contract. He recently extended the contracts of franchise cornerstones Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic, the latter who was named an All-Star each of the last two seasons and First Team All-NBA in 2018-19 and Second Team in 2019-20.\n\nDuring Kroenke's tenure with the Nuggets they have registered six 50+ win seasons, two Western Conference Finals appearances and three Northwest Division titles. He has overseen two NBA Executive of the Year awards, one NBA Coach of the Year award, seven All-Star selections, five All-NBA selections and five players selected to All-Rookie teams. During the 2010-11 season, Kroenke helped orchestrate one of the biggest trades in league history, completing a three-team, 13-player deal with the New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves on Feb. 22, 2011, retooling the Nuggets roster that went on to win a team-record 57 games during the 2012-13 season.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Kroenke named Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President/General Manager/Alternate Governor of the Avalanche. The Avalanche responded by winning the Central Division and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010. The past three seasons have seen the Avalanche make three consecutive postseason appearances for the first time in 14 years and advance to the second round in each of the last two years.\n\nKroenke, in conjunction with the National Hockey League, was instrumental in bringing the 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game to Denver. The event, which featured the Avalanche and the Red Wings playing at Coors Field on Feb. 27, 2016, was the first ever NHL outdoor game in the State of Colorado. The 2019-20 season saw the Avalanche host its second outdoor game in four years, this time at the U.S. Air Force Academy on Feb. 15, 2020 against the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nIn November 2017, the Avalanche was selected by the NHL to participate in the 2017 SAP NHL Global Series, which featured a pair of regular-season games against the Ottawa Senators in Stockholm, Sweden. These were the first regular-season games ever played by the Avs in Europe.\n\nIn addition to his responsibilities with the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke, 40, serves as Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (Major League Soccer) and is on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club (English Premier League) in London. In his role as Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, he works closely with KSE executives on multiple business operation issues, ranging from finance to marketing.\n\nIn 2014, Kroenke was named to the SportsBusiness Daily's prestigious \"Forty Under 40\" list. The annual list honors the most promising young executives in sports business under the age of 40.\n\nAdditionally, Kroenke has spearheaded numerous business initiatives throughout Ball Arena and the Nuggets and Avalanche organizations. In 2013 he oversaw the installation of a multimillion-dollar 4,400 square foot HD center-hung scoreboard, one of the largest and most technologically advanced scoreboards in a professional sports arena. In just the past two years he has unveiled new home, road and alternate jerseys for the Nuggets, overseen the complete redesign of the Nuggets' locker room, training room and players' lounge, and introduced the multimillion-dollar Club Lexus, offering exclusive amenities and services to Nuggets and Avalanche ticketholders.\n\nKroenke is also leading KSE into the fast-growing area of eSports. He was instrumental in the decision to create KSE eSports and acquire an inaugural franchise in Activision/Blizzard's Overwatch league, now known as the Los Angeles Gladiators. As co-founder of KSE eSports with his father Stan, Josh has helped guide all elements of the operation including branding and launch of the team in January 2018.\n\nAthletic competition has always been a passion for Kroenke, who attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship. He was a contributor during Missouri's trip to the Elite Eight as a sophomore in 2002, and he earned Academic All-Big XII First Team honors while serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons. After graduating with a degree in financial management, Kroenke completed a six-month internship with the NBA's League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked on Wall Street where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions.\n\nAway from the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke serves on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club in London and on the Board of Strategic Development for the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri. Kroenke is an active supporter of Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. He is involved in several other charitable endeavors, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which was co-founded by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide by building schools that specialize in teaching music and arts."
