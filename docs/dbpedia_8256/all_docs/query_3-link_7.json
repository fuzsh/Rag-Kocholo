        "text": "Phil Cole/Getty Images\n\nMany fans thought Arsenal would break its trophy-less jinx this season.\n\nArsenal reached the Carling Cup Final, when a quadruple was a possibility, but March seemed to be the month that spelled doom for the Gunners, as they were knocked out of the Champions League and the F.A. Cup following their shocking defeat at the hands of Birmingham City, leaving only the Premier League title left to fight for.\n\nThe Gunners came close to Manchester United in the points table and were provided with opportunities to overtake them, but they failed to seize the opportunity.\n\nThough Arsenal played well against the top clubs of the Premier League, it failed to dominate certain clubs, and this cost them the Premier League title.\n\nHere are the teams that haunted Arsenal in 2010-11.\n\nMike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nThe Gunners had to visit the Stadium of Light in their first meeting against Sunderland. Since the Black Cats had an impressive home record, a draw was a good result for the Gunners, who were without Van Persie and Thomas Vermaelan.\n\nThe Gunners gained the lead in their 12th minute from a Cesc Fabregas goal (one of the weirdest goals all year in the Premier League).\n\nAfter that the Gunners captain had to be substituted due to injury, and Tomas Rosicky came on for him. Rosicky squandered a great chance to seal the points when he skied a penalty with 17 minutes left.\n\nThe match ended with Bent netting in the equalizer in injury time to deny the Gunners two valuable points.\n\nThough the result was quite expected, Arsenal had a great chance to win the game. Hence, it was a disappointment.\n\nThe second meeting between Arsenal and Sunderland at the Emirates was even worse for the Gunners.\n\nPoor refereeing cost the Gunners two points as an Arshavin goal was controversially, and wrongly, ruled offside, and the linesman did not see a poor challenge by Bramble on Arshavin in Sunderland's D-box, which should have been a penalty.\n\nScott Heavey/Getty Images\n\nIn the first meeting at the Emirates, WBA emerged as the top team when they took a three-goal lead over the Gunners.\n\nNasri was able to score two goals after that, but it was not enough to salvage a point.\n\nThis match led to the saying, \"If Nasri is able to find 1,000 ways to score goals, then Almunia will be able to find 1,001 ways to let goals.\"\n\nAlmunia was eventually removed from the first squad.\n\nThe second meeting, at the Hawthorns, ended in a draw. In this match it was again Almunia who was responsible for losing two points.\n\nWBA quickly went up 2-0 with a Reid header and then a Odemwingie goal. Though Arsenal was able to get back two goals through Arshavin and Van Persie, this game should have been Arsenal's revenge for losing at the Emirates.\n\nThe second goal at the Hawthorns was a huge blunder made by Almunia that saw him removed from the first team for the remainder of the season.\n\nEveryone would be surprised if Wenger still had Almunia on his squad next season.\n\nLaurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe North London Derby is always exciting, and the buildup to this season's derby was true to form.\n\nIn the first game at the Emirates, the Gunners took a two-goal lead at halftime.\n\nEveryone expected Arsenal to win, but the Spurs had other plans.\n\nBale started the scoring for the Spurs in the 50th minute. A handball by Fabregas in Arsenal's D-box lead to a penalty, through which Van Der Vaart scored the equalizer.\n\nIn the last few minutes, Kaboul headed the ball into the nets, helping Tottenham win all three points. Tottenham recorded their first victory on Arsenal territory in 17 years.\n\nThe second North London Derby at White Hart Lane was equally exciting, with the game ending in a 3-3 draw. In this game also, Arsenal went up 3-1 then let go of a two-goal advantage, managing this time to salvage a draw.\n\nRichard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nThe first match at the Emirates ended with a defeat to the Gunners, with Andy Carroll scoring the only goal by means of a header.\n\nThis was a home match which everyone expected Arsenal to win, but it did not happen.\n\nEven though the Gunners lost this game, it was their next meeting that made news.\n\nThe second match at St. James Park turned out to be the real nightmare for the Gunners. Arsenal were 4-0 up within the first half hour of the game, with Walcott, Djourou and van Persie (twice) netting the ball.\n\nIt was the last half hour of the game that truly mattered.\n\nDiaby was sent off before the hour mark and the Gunners gave away two penalties, through which Barton scored. Best added to the score 15 minutes from full time, and Tiote equalized in the 87th minute. The Magpies could have almost won the game when a goal was ruled out offside by the linesman.\n\nThe Gunners were unhappy with the referee with Wenger stating \"It was a completely unnecessary sending-off, and I believe Joey Barton was very lucky to stay on the pitch for the tackle on Diaby\"."
