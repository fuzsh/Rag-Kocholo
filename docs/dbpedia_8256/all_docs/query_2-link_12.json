        "text": "Everton are flying high at the top of the Premier League and will look to use that confidence when aiming to end their miserable run against Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nFour wins from a possible four places Carlo Ancelotti’s side first in the table, three points and four positions above Liverpool after the champions were humiliated 7-2 at Aston Villa before the international break.\n\nNow the two sides collide for the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Saturday, with plenty on the line as Liverpool look to bounce back from their humbling defeat and Everton bid to build a six-point lead over their local rivals.\n\nEverton are enjoying their best start to a season since 1894 and, with an action-packed campaign so far producing unprecedented results, it is time to see what the Toffees are made of as some quarters moot the possibility of an unlikely league win to follow in Leicester’s title-winning footsteps from four years ago.\n\nThe problem for Everton is they have not won a Merseyside derby for a decade, but perhaps they have never been better placed to lift the hex cast over them in recent years.\n\nEverton’s last win against Liverpool\n\nThe Saturday lunchtime match at Goodison Park will mark exactly 10 years to the day since Everton last claimed victory over Liverpool – a 2-0 win.\n\nIt is a remarkably long time given both sides remain Premier League ever-presents, with 22 meetings since resulting in 11 draws and 11 victories for Liverpool.\n\nYou need only look back at the names in the starting line-ups to recognise this was a time when Liverpool were struggling to reach the top four, with Everton just outside the European places themselves.\n\nTim Cahill and Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta were on target either side of half-time for an Everton side captained by Phil Neville, with Yakubu leading the line, Leighton Baines at left-back and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov among those coming off the bench.\n\nLiverpool meanwhile boasted a back four of Jamie Carragher, Martin Skrtel, Sotiris Kyrgiakos and Paul Konchesky, with Joe Cole and Maxi Rodriguez in a line-up also featuring Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres.\n\nEverton’s record since 2010 win\n\nA miserable 11 losses and 11 defeats to Liverpool. There have been some resounding losses at Anfield, 5-2 in 2019, 4-0 in both 2014 and 2016, while the last three Premier League matches at Goodison Park have ended 0-0.\n\nResults since Everton’s 2-0 win (Premier League unless stated)\n\n16 Jan 2011: Liverpool 2-2 Everton\n\n1 Oct 2011: Everton 0-2 Liverpool\n\n13 Mar 2012: Liverpool 3-0 Everton\n\n14 Apr 2012: Everton 1-2 Liverpool (FA Cup)\n\n28 Oct 2012: Everton 2-2 Liverpool\n\n5 May 2013: Liverpool 0-0 Everton\n\n23 Nov 2013: Everton 3-3 Liverpool\n\n28 Jan 2014: Liverpool 4-0 Everton\n\n27 Sep 2014: Liverpool 1-1 Everton\n\n7 Feb 2015: Everton 0-0 Liverpool\n\n4 Oct 2015: Everton 1-1 Liverpool\n\n20 Apr 2016: Liverpool 4-0 Everton\n\n19 Dec 2016: Everton 0-1 Liverpool\n\n1 Apr 2017: Liverpool 3-1 Everton\n\n10 Dec 2017: Liverpool 1-1 Everton\n\n5 Jan 2018: Liverpool 2-1 Everton (FA Cup)\n\n7 Apr 2018: Everton 0-0 Liverpool\n\n2 Dec 2018: Liverpool 1-0 Everton\n\n3 Mar 2019: Everton 0-0 Liverpool\n\n4 Dec 2019: Liverpool 5-2 Everton\n\n5 Jan 2020: Liverpool 1-0 Everton (FA Cup)\n\n21 Jun 2020: Everton 0-0 Liverpool\n\nIn fact, the last six league matches at Everton have produced just three goals between them. Before that, a 3-3 which saw Daniel Sturridge’s 89th-minute equaliser deny the hosts.\n\nTheir most recent meeting back in June saw Alisson Becker come to Liverpool’s rescue, with the goalkeeper denying Dominic Calvert-Lewin late on before Tom Davies hit the post in the goalless draw.\n\nEverton’s win in 2010 was a result which left Liverpool in the relegation zone after eight matches, and was the first game since John W Henry bought the club for £300m.\n\nNot even three months later, Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson was dismissed with Kenny Dalglish placed in charge. The Reds would go on to finish sixth, with eighth and seventh-place finishes following before they were runners-up in 2013-14.\n\nA decade on, owner Henry has seen his Liverpool side become Champions League and then Premier League winners, and he will watch this Merseyside derby fresh from a failed bid to reform English football.\n\nEverton meanwhile finished the 2010-11 season seventh, and having last finished fourth in 2004-05 the early signs this year are that a push for the Champions League places is more than realistic.\n\n23rd time lucky?\n\nTo end this 22-game run without a victory against Liverpool, Ancelotti will simply urge his Everton side to replicate the form that has propelled them to the top of the table.\n\nThe international break will have somewhat halted this momentum, but in Calvert-Lewin Everton have a striker returning in buoyant mood after scoring on his England debut against Wales.\n\nWith two goals and one assist in his last Premier League game, James Rodriguez will look to have a telling influence once more, but with the match falling just three days after the Colombian played all 90 minutes against Chile in Santiago, just how fresh the midfielder exactly is following that trip to South America could have a bearing on his club’s fortunes on Saturday.\n\nLiverpool meanwhile will look to benefit from the fact Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Thiago Alcantara were not on international duty, but still Everton will be confident of exploiting a side that shipped in seven at Villa Park.\n\nTo say Liverpool were off-colour against Villa is an understatement, and though a repeat showing is unlikely, Everton will know that attacking with speed is the best way of inflicting another defeat on Jurgen Klopp’s side.\n\nIt all means the ingredients are in place for this three-game run of goalless draws between the two sides at Goodison Park to come to an end, what with Everton on a roll, the recent high-scoring affairs in the Premier League, and Alisson still out for Liverpool.\n\nBlame us if it ends up being the first 0-0 of the Premier League season…"
