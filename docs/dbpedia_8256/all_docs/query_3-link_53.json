        "text": "By Bulldog Drummond\n\nMuch has been made in terms of three league defeats at the start of the season, and as we’ve noted off and on in recent weeks this is indeed unusual for Arsenal. Not unique, but unusual.\n\nBut a defeat in August or September counts exactly the same as a defeat in November, so I wondered how often we’ve had three defeats in a row at any time of the campaign. Or come to that any other bad runs.\n\nPart of my point is that much has been made of the fact that we have lost three league games at the start of the season – although three defeats in the league, be they in a row or not, be they at the start of the season or not, always lose us the same number of points.\n\nAnd what is particularly interesting is that for many of these runs – the majority in fact – Untold Arsenal had people writing in saying this is the worst run ever and that Wenger should resign.\n\nBut it turns out that one win in seven can still leave us runners’ up in the league!\n\n2018/19: position 5th, runners up in Europa League\n\nThree league defeats in a row.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 21 Apr 2019 Arsenal v Crystal Palace L 2-3 Premier League 24 Apr 2019 Wolverhampton Wanderers v Arsenal L 3-1 Premier League 28 Apr 2019 Leicester City v Arsenal L 3-0 Premier League\n\n2017/18: position 6th, runners up in the League cup.\n\nFive defeats in six, three league defeats in a row.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 10 Feb 2018 Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal L 1-0 Premier League 15 Feb 2018 Östersunds FK v Arsenal W 0-3 Europa League 22 Feb 2018 Arsenal v Östersunds FK L 1-2 Europa League 25 Feb 2018 Arsenal v Manchester City L 0-3 League Cup 1 Mar 2018 Arsenal v Manchester City L 0-3 Premier League 4 Mar 2018 Brighton and Hove Albion v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League\n\n2013/14: position 4th, winners of the FA Cup.\n\nTwo draws, two defeats in the league in a row scoring 3 conceding 12.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 22 Mar 2014 Chelsea v Arsenal L 6-0 Premier League 25 Mar 2014 Arsenal v Swansea City D 2-2 Premier League 29 Mar 2014 Arsenal v Manchester City D 1-1 Premier League 6 Apr 2014 Everton v Arsenal L 3-0 Premier League\n\n2011/12: final position third.\n\nThree league defeats in a row\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 2 Jan 2012 Fulham v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League 15 Jan 2012 Swansea City v Arsenal L 3-2 Premier League 22 Jan 2012 Arsenal v Manchester United L 1-2 Premier League\n\n2010/11 Final position 4th, runners up in the league cup.\n\nOne win in seven in the league.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 17 Apr 2011 Arsenal v Liverpool D 1-1 Premier League 20 Apr 2011 Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal D 3-3 Premier League 24 Apr 2011 Bolton Wanderers v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League 1 May 2011 Arsenal v Manchester United W 1-0 Premier League 08 May 2011 Stoke City v Arsenal L 3-1 Premier League 15 May 2011 Arsenal v Aston Villa L 1-2 Premier League 22 May 2011 Fulham v Arsenal D 2-2 Premier League\n\n2009/2010: Final position 3rd.\n\nThree defeats and a draw in four consecutive league games.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 14 Apr 2010 Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League 18 Apr 2010 Wigan Athletic v Arsenal L 3-2 Premier League 24 Apr 2010 Arsenal v Manchester City D 0-0 Premier League 3 May 2010 Blackburn Rovers v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League\n\n2007/8 Final position 3rd\n\nNo wins in five league games.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 23 Feb 2008 Birmingham City v Arsenal D 2-2 Premier League 1 Mar 2008 Arsenal v Aston Villa D 1-1 Premier League 9 Mar 2008 Wigan Athletic v Arsenal D 0-0 Premier League 15 Mar 2008 Arsenal v Middlesbrough D 1-1 Premier League 23 Mar 2008 Chelsea v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League\n\n2006/07 Final position 4th\n\nThree defeats in a row in different competitions.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 20 Feb 2007 PSV Eindhoven v Arsenal L 1-0 Champions League 25 Feb 2007 Arsenal v Chelsea L 1-2 League Cup 28 Feb 2007 Blackburn Rovers v Arsenal L 1-0 FA Cup\n\nAnd again in the same season, three league defeats in a row.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 18 Mar 2007 Everton v Arsenal L 1-0 Premier League 31 Mar 2007 Liverpool v Arsenal L 4-1 Premier League 7 Apr 2007 Arsenal v West Ham United L 0-1 Premier League\n\n2005/06. Final position 4th\n\nFour defeats and two wins in six consecutive games, including a 7-0 victory in the league.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 10 Jan 2006 Wigan Athletic v Arsenal L 1-0 League Cup 14 Jan 2006 Arsenal v Middlesbrough W 7-0 Premier League 21 Jan 2006 Everton v Arsenal L 1-0 Premier League 24 Jan 2006 Arsenal v Wigan Athletic W 2-1 League Cup 28 Jan 2006 Bolton Wanderers v Arsenal L 1-0 FA Cup 1 Feb 2006 Arsenal v West Ham United L 2-3 Premier League\n\n2005/6 Final position 4th\n\nThree league defeats in a row, plus a goalless draw in the Champs League\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 3 Dec 2005 Bolton Wanderers v Arsenal L 2-0 Premier League 7 Dec 2005 Arsenal v Ajax D 0-0 Champions League 10 Dec 2005 Newcastle United v Arsenal L 1-0 Premier League 18 Dec 2005 Arsenal v Chelsea L 0-2 Premier League\n\n2002/3 Final position 2nd and winners of FA Cup\n\nFour defeats in a row in League and Champs League.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 19 Oct 2002 Everton v Arsenal L 2-1 Premier League 22 Oct 2002 Arsenal v Auxerre L 1-2 Champions League 26 Oct 2002 Arsenal v Blackburn Rovers L 1-2 Premier League 30 Oct 2002 Borussia Dortmund v Arsenal L 2-1 Champions League\n\n2000/01: Final position 2nd and runners up in FA Cup\n\nOne win in seven in all competitions.\n\nDate Match Res Score Competition 1 Nov 2000 Arsenal v Ipswich Town L 1-2 League Cup 4 Nov 2000 Middlesbrough v Arsenal W 0-1 Premier League 7 Nov 2000 Shakhtar Donetsk v Arsenal L 3-0 Champions League 11 Nov 2000 Arsenal v Derby County D 0-0 Premier League 18 Nov 2000 Everton v Arsenal L 2-0 Premier League 22 Nov 2000 Spartak Moskva v Arsenal L 4-1 Champions League 26 Nov 2000 Leeds United v Arsenal L 1-0 Premier League\n\nMy conclusion is simple: three defeats in a row tells us little, except that several members of the team were suffering from the virus at the start, and two of the games were against two of last season’s top clubs.\n\nUnderstanding Arsenal’s start to the 2021/22 season"
