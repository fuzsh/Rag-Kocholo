        "text": "Morgan Gautrat (née Brian)\n\nBefore joining the U.S. Women’s National Team, Gautrat competed with Ponte Vedra Storm (FL) in the National League and US Youth Soccer National Championship Series. Following her youth career, she starred at the University of Virginia, where she captured back-to-back MAC Hermann Trophies before being selected No. 1 overall by the Houston Dash in the 2015 NWSL Draft. Gautrat was a key part of the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup Champion U.S. Women’s National Team and the youngest member of the squad at just 22 years of age. She became a two-time World Cup champion while part of the winning U.S. team in 2019.\n\nDanielle Colaprico\n\nColaprico was a member of the PDA Tsunami (NJ) side that competed in the inaugural National League season. She went on to have a standout career at the University of Virginia, where she finished as the Cavalier’s all-time leader in assists and appearances. After being selected with the ninth pick in the 2015 NWSL Draft, Colaprico led the Chicago Red Stars in minutes played during her first season and was selected as the 2015 NWSL Rookie of the Year. She earned her first cap for the U.S. Women’s National Team in 2018.\n\nRose Lavelle\n\nLavelle played in multiple National League seasons with CUP Crew Jrs. 94/95 (OH-S), tallying a single goal in each of the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. The skillful midfielder played collegiately at Wisconsin, where she earned Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors, was twice named Big Ten Midfielder of the Year and garnered First-Team All-American recognition. In 2014, she earned tournament MVP while helping the U.S. Under-20 Women’s National Team win the CONCACAF U-20 Women’s Championship. The Boston Breakers selected Lavelle with the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NWSL Draft, and she earned her first cap with the U.S. Women’s National Team a couple months later. In 2019, Lavelle earned Bronze Ball honors while helping the U.S. win its second straight FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n\nSamantha Mewis\n\nBefore a standout college career at UCLA, Mewis competed in the National League as a member of Scorpions Elite (MA). A two-time team captain at UCLA, she helped the Bruins to the 2013 NCAA National Championship, finished sixth in program history with 94 career points and captured Pac-12 Player of the Year honors as a senior. While in college, Mewis earned her first caps with the U.S. Women’s National Team. The Western New York Flash selected Mewis fourth overall in the 2015 NWSL Draft, and she was a finalist for 2015 Rookie of the Year honors.

Sonnett continued on to the University of Virginia, where she garnered numerous honors, including 2014 College Cup Most Outstanding Defensive Player, 2015 ACC Defensive Player of the Year and 2015 ESPNW National Player of the Year. During her senior season at Virginia, Sonnett earned her first cap for the U.S. Women’s National Team and has been a regular contributor since that time — winning the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup with the U.S. At the 2016 NWSL Draft, Portland Thorns FC selected Sonnett with the No. 1 overall pick, and she became a regular starter during Portland’s run as one of the most successful teams in the NWSL.\n\nSam Staab\n\nStaab helped anchor the back line for DMCV Sharks Elite (CA-S) — one of the most successful girls teams in US Youth Soccer history. In addition to two National League division titles (2012-13 and 2013-14), DMCV won back-to-back National Championships in 2013 and 2014 and advanced to the championship game in 2015. Staab enjoyed a standout college career at Clemson before being drafted by the Washington Spirit with the No. 4 pick in the 2019 NWSL Draft. Staab became a mainstay in starting lineups and set the NWSL record for consecutive starts before earning her first caps with the U.S. Women’s National Team in 2024.\n\nJack Harrison\n\nHarrison played in the 2013-14 National League season with Manhattan SC PSG 96 (NY-E), as the New York side narrowly missed out on a top-two finish in the league. Manhattan later qualified for the 2014 National Championships, and Harrison won the Golden Ball while helping his side claim the National title. Following a standout freshman season at Wake Forest that included ACC Offensive Player of the Year honors, Harrison was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 MLS SuperDraft. After a move to Manchester City, and while on loan to Leeds United, Harrison became the first National League alum to play in the English Premier League and scored in his debut.\n\nJordan Morris\n\nTwice among the leading scorers in the National League, Morris helped Eastside FC 94 Red (WA) succeed at the regional and national levels during his youth career. At Stanford, Morris was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team in both 2013 and 2014. As a junior at Stanford, he won the MAC Hermann Trophy while helping the Cardinal to the National Championship. In 2014, Morris became the first college player in 19 years to earn a cap with the U.S. Men’s National Team, and he scored in his first international start against Mexico in 2015. Morris signed with Seattle Sounders FC prior to a 2016 Rookie of the Year season and has helped the club to multiple MLS Cups.\n\nKeegan Rosenberry\n\nFor two straight years, Rosenberry competed in the National League with Penn Fusion Celtic (PA-E). Playing as a midfielder, he scored multiple goals in each season and helped Penn Fusion finish second in 2010-11. Rosenberry continued his playing career at Georgetown, where he made 90 appearances and twice earned Second-Team All-Big East Conference honors. Selected No. 3 overall by the Philadelphia Union in the 2016 MLS SuperDraft, Rosenberry played every minute of all 34 matches in his first campaign while finishing second in MLS Rookie of the Year voting. The defender earned the MLS Individual Fair Play Award in his first season by receiving zero bookings despite being the lone field player in the league to play every minute of the season.\n\nGedion Zelalem\n\nZelalem was part of an OBGC Rangers (MD) team that compiled some of the most potent offensive seasons in the National League’s history. His standout play with Rangers helped Zelalem land a spot with Arsenal FC in London, England. As a 16-year-old, Zelalem made his debut with the Arsenal senior side — coming on as a substitute in a 4-0 FA Cup victory in January 2014. He later saw action with Arsenal in a 4-1 win against Galatasaray in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nWalker Zimmerman\n\nA talented defender, Zimmerman helped GSA Phoenix Red (GA) to a rare 7-0-0 record during the 2009-10 National League season — tallying three goals along the way to finish among the Top 10 scorers. He was named All-Southern Conference First Team in each of his two seasons at Furman University, where the defender totaled 11 goals and five assists as a freshman and sophomore. Zimmerman was selected by FC Dallas with the seventh overall pick in the 2013 MLS SuperDraft and recorded a pair of goals during his rookie season in 2013. Zimmerman debuted with the U.S. Men’s National Team in 2017 and competed in the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup."
