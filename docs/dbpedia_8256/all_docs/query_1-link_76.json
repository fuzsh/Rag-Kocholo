        "text": "Arsenal are set for a busy summer transfer window after enduring a torrid 2020/21 campaign.\n\nThe Gunners finished eighth in the Premier League and were defeated by former boss Unai Emery's Villarreal side in the semi-finals of the Europa League.\n\nTherefore, Mikel Arteta is reportedly willing to be ruthless in the market, readying to offload several underperforming senior players in an attempt to raise funds for new signings in the coming weeks.\n\nfootball.london understands that chief executive Edu Gaspar is hoping to bring in at least five new faces this summer, with moves for two fullbacks, two midfielders and a centre-back all potentially touted.\n\nThe Brazilian will be hoping to bring in young players with sky-high potential, as well as some Premier League proven players - with the likes of Brighton duo Yves Bissouma and Ben White both touted as targets.\n\nThe North London club have enjoyed a topsy-turvy time since the turn of the Millenium, clinching two Premier League titles as well as seven FA Cups but also experienced Champions League final heartbreak followed by recent years of mediocrity.\n\nOne of the forefront reasons for their recent struggles has been poor performance in the transfer market, often paying over the odds for players who eventually turn out to be flops.\n\nHere we take a look at the 11 biggest duds in the past 20 years of the Gunners' incoming transfers.\n\n11. Granit Xhaka\n\nIt may seem harsh to include Granit Xhaka on this list given he has put in several quality performances in an Arsenal shirt but a combination between his hefty transfer fee and numerous costly errors make him the best of a bad bunch.\n\nThe Swiss midfielder was favoured to then-Leicester stalwart N'Golo Kante in the summer of 2016 by Arsene Wenger for £37million, a decision that has proven to be a costly error by the Frenchman.\n\nXhaka has consistently made some horrific blunders while in an Arsenal shirt, conceding five penalties and eight errors leading to goals, three more than any other outfield player in the Premier League since his arrival.\n\nFurthermore, he boasts a poor disciplinary record, receiving a whopping three red and 42 yellow cards in just five seasons at the Emirates.\n\nXhaka looks all but set for a move to Italian side AS Roma in the coming months, with a fee in the region of £17million reportedly agreed.\n\n10. Sokratis\n\nGreek defender Sokratis was one of Unai Emery's first singings as Gunners boss in the summer of 2018, joining from Borussia Dortmund for a reported £17.6million, a hefty fee for a 30-year-old who was clearly on the decline.\n\nThe signing seemed an odd one from the get-go to Arsenal fans and they were immediately proven right as the centre-back looked completely off the pace during a pre-season friendly fixture against Boreham Wood, a side that plays four divisions below Arsenal.\n\nThe former Werder Bremen defender quickly proved that his pre-season performance was not just a one-off as he consistently gave away needless fouls in dangerous areas and would often over-commit in an attempt to aggressively win the ball back after a sloppy mistake.\n\nEventually, Arsenal lost their patience with Sokratis and he was shipped to Olympiakos in January after his contract was cancelled by 'mutual consent'.\n\n9. Andre Santos\n\nFrench left-back Gael Clichy left Arsenal for Manchester City in the summer of 2011 for £7million and was replaced by Brazilian defender Andre Santos for the same price.\n\nClichy had been a reliable fullback for the Gunners, making the 2008 PFA Team of the Year after consistent performances down the left flank but Santos was the polar opposite of his predecessor.\n\nHe consistently found himself out of position, often bombing down the wing, only to jog back in position as an impending opposition counter-attack ensued.\n\nArsenal fans completely lost patience with the former Fenerbahce fullback after he swapped shirts with former Gunner Robin van Persie at half-time of a loss to Manchester United in November 2012.\n\nHe eventually moved back to Brazil in July 2013, joining Flamengo for free after his deal in North London expired.\n\n8. Lucas Perez\n\nSpanish striker Lucas Perez was reportedly a signing identified by Arsenal's infamous StatDNA analytics after he bagged 17 goals for Deportivo La Coruna in the 2015/16 season.\n\nPerez joined Wenger's side for a reported £18million in August 2016 but failed to ever establish himself as a first-team regular.\n\nDespite occasional flashes in front of goal, including a hat-trick against Basel in the Champions League, the speedy frontman scored just seven times for the Gunners and was eventually offloaded to West Ham for just £4million in 2018, a poor return considering what they paid for him just two years prior.\n\n7. Marouane Chamakh\n\nWith Dutch forward, Robin van Persie consistently struggling with a multitude of injury issues in 2010, Wenger decided it was time to add reinforcements in the striker department and opted to sign Bordeaux frontman Marouane Chamakh on a free transfer.\n\nThe Moroccan international was highly regarded in France after scoring 16 goals during the 2008/09 season across all competitions, helping fire Les Girondins to their only Ligue 1 title this century.\n\nChamakh started his debut campaign brightly, bagging seven goals and four assists in his first 15 Premier League games.\n\nHowever, his form began to falter and van Persie then was handed the reigns when he returned from injury, something Chamakh never recovered from.\n\nThe gangly centre-forward netted just 14 goals in 67 appearances for the North Londoners before he was shipped off to Crystal Palace in 2013.\n\n6. Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nWhen Arsenal acquire players from Premier League top-four rivals it never seems to go well and the swap deal between Alexis Sanchez and Henrikh Mkhitaryan was no different.\n\nSanchez had been a consistently performing world-class frontman for the Gunners, bagging 80 goals 45 assists across 166 games for the club before deciding that he wanted to leave in an attempt to compete for silverware.\n\nArsenal received a £60million bid for the Chilean in the summer of 2018 but then bizarrely swapped him with Mkhitaryan, worth much less than that fee, just six months later\n\nThe Armenian flattered to deceive at the Emirates, registering three assists on his Gunners debut in a 5-1 rout of Everton before notching just nine goals and 10 assists in his following 58 games.\n\nMkhitaryan's contract was eventually cancelled last summer, allowing him to join AS Roma, who he had spent the previous season on loan with.\n\n5. Lucas Torreira\n\nUruguayan international Torreira joined the Unai Emery revolution from Sampdoria three years ago after a stellar 2018 World Cup campaign.\n\nMany Italian footballing experts thought it was a shrewd piece of business to bring Torreira to the Emirates for £24million, lauding him as the exact type of tough-tackling midfielder that Arsenal had been calling out for.\n\nIt seemed like he was beginning to prove everyone right, winning the man of the match award three times in a four-game stretch with excellent displays against Spurs, Bournemouth and Liverpool as the Gunners picked up seven points from a possible nine.\n\nHowever, Torreira began to fall out of favour with Emery, who began utilising the 25-year-old as a No.10, a position he clearly was not suitable for and his form dropped.\n\nWhen Mikel Arteta arrived as the new head coach in December 2019 he initially played Torreira before eventually favouring Spanish playmaker Dani Ceballos alongside Granit Xhaka in the centre of the park.\n\nTorreira then moved to Atletico Madrid on loan last summer but struggled to get in Diego Simeone's side, starting just three league matches during his stint in the Spanish capital.\n\nThe gritty midfielder will likely be shown the door this summer, with a move back to Italy seemingly on the cards.\n\n4. Sebastien Squillaci\n\nFrench centre-back Sebastian Squillaci was brought in from Sevilla in the summer of 2010 for a fee believed to be £6.5million.\n\nHe was brought in to replace Tottenham-bound William Gallas but it quickly became apparent Squillaci was a lot worse than his countryman.\n\nThe former Lyon defender looked completely out of his depth at the Emirates and didn't possess the pace or strength required to play in the Premier League.\n\nSeasoned German centre-half Per Mertesacker came in just 12 months after Squillaci signed for Arsenal, resulting in him falling down the pecking order before he was released in 2013.\n\n3. Willian\n\nIt might seem harsh to have a player who didn't even cost Arsenal anything in transfer fees so high up the list but that is testament to how disappointing Willian's brief stint in North London has been.\n\nThe Brazilian winger joined from Chelsea last summer after Mikel Arteta had made it clear how badly he wanted the seasoned veteran in his squad.\n\nDespite his astronomical reported £180,000 a week wages, Willian failed to live up to the hype, scoring a measly one goal across 37 games last season.\n\nNot only were his performances extremely lacklustre but he also ate into the minutes of youth prospects Reiss Nelson and Gabriel Martinelli, another reason for his high. ranking.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not he will even continue at the Emirates next season as Sky Sports reported that a number of sides across Europe, as well as MLS side Inter Miami, are interested in acquiring his services this summer.\n\n2. Francis Jeffers\n\nArsenal purchased Jeffers from Everton in 2001 for £8million, a handsome fee back in the early 2000s.\n\nThe English striker was signed to help Thierry Henry with the goalscoring burden but all he did was get in the Frenchman's way, scoring just eight goals in 38 games for the Gunners before he was loaned back to the Toffees in 2003.\n\nTo add insult to injury Wenger revealed that he chose to sign Jeffers over Dutch frontman Ruud van Nistelrooy, who eventually signed for Manchester United that same summer.\n\n\"We were considering him (Ruud van Nistelrooy) and Francis Jeffers and, in the end, we went for Jeffers,\" Wenger revealed.\n\n1. Shkodran Mustafi\n\nGerman defender Mustafi arrived in North London in the summer of 2016 for a cool £35million, making him the fourth most expensive signing in Arsenal's history, at the time.\n\nThe deal was one that was generally thought of as a positive one at the time given Mustafi had been instrumental in Germany's 2014 World Cup win two years prior and had also formed an excellent partnership with Nicolas Otamendi during his stint with Valencia.\n\nFurthermore, the former Everton centre-back hit the ground running at the Emirates, remaining unbeaten in his first 22 matches in an Arsenal shirt - including an impressive display during the Gunners 3-0 victory over Chelsea when he kept Spanish frontman Diego Costa quiet for 90 minutes.\n\nHowever, the feel-good factor soon wore off as Mustafi began making numerous high-profile mistakes.\n\nArsenal fans had already begun to lose faith in the calamitous centre-half during Arsene Wenger's final campaign but it was the 2018/19 season that the Gunners faithful turned on him.\n\nMustafi gave away a penalty in the 82nd minute against Crystal Palace in November, squandering a 2-1 late which cost Arsenal crucial points in their bid for Champions League football.\n\nHe then did the same again in March's North London derby, conceding a penalty late on to hand Tottenham a draw after needlessly bringing Harry Kane down in the box, a result that ended up costing the Gunners a spot in the top flour."
