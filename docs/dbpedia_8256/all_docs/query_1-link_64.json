        "text": "5. Matt Le Tissier, Southampton v Newcastle United, 1993-94\n\nOne of the most gifted players of his generation, Matt Le Tissier’s goals from open play were often a joy to watch, and his goal against Newcastle in the 1990s was a strong candidate for the best Premier League goal ever. Flicking the ball away from two Newcastle defenders in succession, Le Tissier then calmly stroked the ball into the net. The bemused look on the Newcastle ‘keeper’s face subsequently told its own story!\n\n4. Thierry Henry, Arsenal v Manchester United, 2000-01\n\nPerhaps better known for scoring goals at the end of brilliant runs, this goal at Highbury showed that the Frenchman could score special goals of different types. Against Manchester United in 2000, Henry turned to smash in an unstoppable volley from outside the United penalty area.\n\n3. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United v Manchester City, 2010-11\n\nSpectacular goals tend to be even more memorable when they come in big games, and Wayne Rooney’s bicycle kick against local rivals City definitely was unforgettable. In even his great career it would be hard to think of Wayne Rooney ever having scored a better goal.\n\n2. Tony Yeboah, Leeds United v Wimbledon, 1995-96\n\nA scorer of stunning goals on a regular basis, Tony Yeboah’s strike against Wimbledon was outstanding even by his standards. Juggling the ball, Yeboah then waltzed past the Wimbledon defence before unleashing a vicious right foot shot from the edge of the area. Yeboah scored a hat-trick in this game, and his performance showed just why he was was one of the best Premier League strikers of the 1990s.\n\n1. David Beckham, Manchester United v Wimbledon, 1996-97\n\nDavid Beckham’s lofted strike from the halfway line was pretty much unprecedented in the top flight of English football. While, though Wayne Rooney for Manchester United and Charlie Adam for Stoke City have scored goals from the halfway line in the Premier League since it’s the Beckham effort that really stays in one’s memory. With Wimbledon ‘keeper Neil Sullivan off his line, Beckham effectively chipped him from the halfway line for possibly the best goal in Premier League history.\n\nThough the country is best known for being pretty amazing at rugby, football in Wales is also kind of a big deal, with its teams making waves outside of Wales and football mania out in force, picking up all over the country.\n\nSome of its teams, like Cardiff City, have strong reputations across the footballing world, and their national football team, who represent Wales in big tournaments, are becoming increasingly competitive after a slight lull in performance. Want the low down on Welsh football and the country’s unique scene? Keep reading for our informative, definitive guide to all things Pêl-droed.\n\nThe Welsh Cup\n\nThe Welsh Cup is the pinnacle of Welsh football and is one of its most prized and celebrated sport institutions. Founded in 1877, it is also one of the oldest surviving football competitions not just in Wales, but in the world. Every year, the cup sends everyone in Wales into football crazy mode as they get their flags out and don their football jerseys in support of their local or favourite team. Wrexham currently hold the record for most wins in the cup, with Cardiff City coming in very close second at just one win behind.\n\nFamous Welsh players\n\nWales has birthed a whole host of talented players who have now achieved worldwide fame, many of them playing for big international teams while also being key players in the Wales national team. Amongst them are Gareth Bale, who is now playing for Real Madrid, Ryan Giggs, who has enjoyed a lengthy and successful football career in the UK, veteran Manchester United player Mark Hughes. The late great Trevor Ford and Aaron, Ramsey who is fast becoming one of the biggest names to come out of Wales.\n\nCardiff City F.C.\n\nOne of the most popular professional team in all of Wales, Cardiff City, are the only non-English club to have succeeded in winning the FA Cup. They have played in an array of championships and national cup finals in the United Kingdom. The team is adored by those in Cardiff and has accumulated a number of supporters outside of Wales as it has played continually impressive matches all over the UK.\n\nThe Premier League was officially founded in 1992, after all clubs in the old First Division resigned from the Football League and joined the breakaway division. Since that time, the Premier League has functioned as the highest level of professional football in England.\n\nOne of the main reasons behind the new league was commercial independence from the Football Association. This allowed the Premier League to negotiate its own television and sponsorship deals, providing more money for clubs to compete with the biggest teams in Europe.\n\nInitially, 22 clubs competed in the Premier League, although this was reduced to 20 teams ahead of the 1995-96 campaign.\n\nManchester United were crowned as the first Premier League champions in the 1992-93 season and they are the most successful team in the league’s history, winning it a total of 13 times.\n\nIn 2003-04, Arsenal made history, becoming the first team to complete an entire Premier League season without losing a match. The following year, Chelsea were crowned as champions and set various records, including the highest points total and the fewest goals conceded.\n\nFounded in 1899, Cardiff City FC began life as Riverside AFC until a name change in 1908. They moved into their famous ground Ninian Park in 1910 and began a gradual development.\n\nIn 1927, Cardiff City won the FA Cup, becoming the only side outside England to do so. However, this was their crowning achievement and the club slipped into a period of decline.\n\nFollowing the war, they spent many decades struggling in the lower divisions, with relegation a constant struggle. There were some high points though, mainly due to qualification to Europe and a semi-final place in the Cup Winners Cup.\n\nIn recent years, Cardiff have been resurgent with a new stadium, an FA Cup final place, Championship victory and promotion to the Premier League being the high points. A rebrand, which saw the traditional kit colour of blue changing to red, has caused some fan discontent, but overall the future for Cardiff City looks to be bright."
