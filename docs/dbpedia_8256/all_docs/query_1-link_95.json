        "text": "Using data compiled by dirtyplayers.co.uk, we reveal the top-flight footballers who have found themselves in the most hot water since 1992.\n\n10. Kevin Davies\n\nThe former Southampton, Blackburn and Bolton target man often felt he was hard done by when it came to refereesâ decisions, with Davies regularly penalised for flailing arms (or elbows, depending on your interpretation) when competing for aerial challenges. Despite his protestations, the one-time England international was booked 99 times and given his marching orders twice.\n\nTotal dirty points: 545\n\n9. George Boateng\n\nIn 384 Premier League appearances for Coventry, Middlesbrough, Aston Villa and Hull, defensive midfielder Boateng had his name taken 85 times. He was also sent off on five occasions, although he did win an appeal after being unfairly shown a red card following a clash of heads with Blackburnâs Morten Gamst Pedersen in 2010.\n\nTotal dirty points: 550\n\n8. Wayne Rooney\n\nEngland fans will remember Rooneyâs sendings-off against Portugal (for stamping on Ricardo Carvalhoâs unmentionables) and Montenegro (for kicking out at Miodrag Dzudovic), but heâs also suffered disciplinary problems in the Premier League. Indeed, in 469 top-flight games for Everton and Manchester United, Rooney has been hit with 100 cards â 97 yellows and three reds.\n\nTotal dirty points: 560\n\n7. Lee Cattermole\n\nHaving accumulated 565 dirty points in just 271 appearances, Cattermole possesses the worst point-to-game ratio in Premier League history. The Sunderland midfielder, who also played for Middlesbrough and Wigan in the top flight, is something of a throwback with his black boots and no-nonsense attitude, while some of his tackling â which has brought five red cards and 88 yellows â is rather old-school too.\n\nTotal dirty points: 565\n\n6. Richard Dunne\n\nYouâve got to feel sorry for Dunne, the Premier Leagueâs record own-goalscorer who also features prominently in this list. The Irish centre-back played for Everton, Manchester City, Aston Villa and QPR in the first division, collecting eight red cards â another record, albeit shared by two others â and 74 yellows.\n\nTotal dirty points: 570\n\n5. Patrick Vieira\n\nVieira was the driving force behind Arsenalâs most successful period in the Premier League, starring in the title triumphs of 1998, 2002 and 2004. It wasnât all pretty football, however: the Frenchman was sent off eight times â nobody has been given their marching orders more often â and picked up 76 cautions for the Gunners and Manchester City, with whom he spent the 2010/11 season.\n\nTotal dirty points: 580\n\n4. Paul Scholes\n\nAn extremely gifted creator, the Manchester United man was never afraid to get involved with the dirty work â the only problem was that he was extremely bad at it. Many chuckled at Scholesâ persistent failure to time his tackles, a defect which earned him 97 yellows and four reds, but Arsene Wenger wasnât quite so kind, arguing there was a âdarker sideâ to the 11-time Premier League champion.\n\nTotal dirty points: 585\n\n3. Scott Parker\n\nBorn and bred in London, Parker went on to play for no fewer than five of the capitalâs clubs â Charlton, Chelsea, West Ham, Tottenham and Fulham â in the Premier League, while also enjoying a two-year spell at Newcastle between 2005 and 2007. The midfielder was sent off five times in his 368 outings, with his name featuring in the refereeâs notebook on a further 92 occasions.\n\nTotal dirty points: 585\n\n2. Lee Bowyer\n\nBowyer infamously had a scrap with Newcastle team-mate Kieron Dyer during a home defeat by Aston Villa in 2005, so itâs no surprise he ranks higher in this list than all but one Premier League player. The ex-Leeds, West Ham and Birmingham midfielder was sent off a further three times, while also collecting 99 bookings during his time in the Premier League.\n\nTotal dirty points: 595\n\n1. Gareth Barry\n\nNo player has made more Premier League appearances than Barry; equally, no player has been quite as dirty as the current West Brom midfielder, whoâs also represented Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton at this level. Barryâs 119 cautions give him a 20-card lead on second-placed Lee Bowyer and Kevin Davies, while heâs also been sent off six times since 1998.\n\nTotal dirty points: 745"
