        "text": "The coldest man in all of West London was at it again on Monday night, scoring not once, not twice, but ... four (4!) times in our 6-0 laugher of a win against Everton at Stamford Bridge — including the fastest “perfect” hat-trick in Premier League history in just 29 minutes (left foot, header, right foot).\n\nHe’s now tied with Erling Haaland at the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts, with 20.\n\nAnd the records just keep falling.\n\nThat’s just the seven (7!) goals then in his last two Premier League games at the Bridge and he’s now scored in seven (7!) consecutive home games. Only the great Didier Drogba can claim similar feats: though even he only managed six home games in a row with a goal, and his back-to-back hat-tricks stretched across two seasons (last game of the 2009-10 season and the first game of the 2010-11 season).\n\nPalmer has also joined Drogba in becoming the fifth player in club history to reach 20 Premier League goals in a campaign, and the first since Diego Costa did it in 2016-17. The others are Frank Lampard and Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink, who was on hand to witness in person Palmer’s latest impressive exploits. (Incidentally, Nicolas Anelka led the league in scoring in 2008-09, but fell just shy of 20 with 19).\n\nPalmer’s also the first Chelsea player to reach 20 goals in all competitions since Eden Hazard did it in 2018-19. Plus, he’s the first player to score four in a game since Oliver Giroud did it in 2020-21, and only the fourth player to do so in a Premier League match for us, after Lampard (twice), Hasselbaink, and the late, great Gianluca Vialli.\n\nAnd presumably, he’s still only just getting started!\n\nHere are the last 15 Chelsea hat-tricks, since 2016, which is when I started keeping this list. It’s the 157th hat-trick in club history, with Palmer the 77th different player to get one for us. (The indispensable Chelsea: The Complete Record has the list of the first 142, from 1905 to 2014.)\n\nJan 2016 — Oscar: 3 vs. MK Dons (a) 5-1 — FA Cup\n\nSep 2017 — Batshuayi: 3 vs. Nottingham Forest (h) 5-1 — League Cup\n\nSep 2017 — Morata: 3 vs. Stoke City (a) 4-0 — Premier League\n\nSep 2018 — Hazard: 3 vs. Cardiff City (h) 4-1 — Premier League\n\nOct 2018 — Loftus-Cheek: 3 vs. BATE (h) 3-1 — Europa League\n\nMar 2019 — Giroud: 3 vs. Dynamo Kiev (a) 5-0 — Europa League\n\nSep 2019 — Abraham: 3 vs. Wolves (a) 5-2 — Premier League\n\nOct 2019 — Pulisic: 3 vs. Burnley (a) 4-2 — Premier League\n\nSep 2020 — Havertz: 3 vs. Barnsley (h) 6-0 — League Cup\n\nDec 2020 — Giroud: 4 vs. Sevilla (a) 4-0 — Champions League\n\nJan 2021 — Abraham: 3 vs. Luton Town (h) 3-1 — FA Cup\n\nOct 2021 — Mount: 3 vs. Norwich City (h) 7-0 — Premier League\n\nNov 2023 — Jackson: 3 vs. Tottenham (a) 4-1 — Premier League\n\nApr 2024 — Palmer: 3 vs. Manchester United (h) 4-3 — Premier League\n\nApri 2024 — Palmer: 4 vs. Everton (h) 6-0 — Premier League"
