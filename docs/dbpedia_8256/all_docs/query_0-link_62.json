        "text": "The young Blues have just been crowned champions - here is an update on the last title-winning U18 squad\n\nThe future’s bright and the future’s Blue.\n\nRoberto Martinez has given English football a meteoric lift with the faith he has shown in youth.\n\n‌\n\nUnder the Blues boss, the likes of 20-year-old Ross Barkley and 19-year-old John Stones have become influential performers\n\nNurturing this young and exciting talent has not only benefited club but also country in both the short and long term.\n\nAnd, with European football back on the map next season, the Catalan has spoken of the scouting mission he will embark on over the summer to look at the current crop of talent at the Blues.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nHaving just last week been crowned Barclays U18 Premier League champions it is clear to see there are some diamonds waiting to be unearthed.\n\nIndeed, U18s boss Kevin Sheedy believes there is potential for some top Premier League players to emerge from his title-winning side.\n\nBut this isn’t the first time a young Blues squad has tasted success.\n\n‌\n\nIn the 2010/11 season another U18s side swept to the same achievement.\n\nTo try and gauge the potential success of the recent winners, here’s a look at where some of the squad members from the last success are now.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Goalkeeper Age: 21 Birthplace: Rheinstein British Military Camp, Germany Current Club: Sheffield Wednesday\n\nNicknamed Big Bad Ad, the shot stopper was ever present for the Blues during the title triumph having made 12 appearances during the season. Having initially joined the Toffees academy set-up when he was 14 the commanding and confident keeper was considered a competent leader.\n\nBut injuries hampered his career at the Blues and despite travelling to the USA with the first team on a pre-season tour in 2011 he failed to make a single competitive appearance. Following his release a year later, Davies was signed by Sheffield Wednesday on a month-by-month contract.\n\n‌\n\nA string of impressive performances for the reserve side earned him a two-year contract, but he has found first team opportunities limited, operating as understudy to former Liverpool goalkeeper Chris Kirkland.\n\nPosition: Right Back/Central Defence Age: 19 Birthplace: Liverpool Current Club: Everton\n\n‌\n\nQuick, physical and with the right mental attitude to boot, Tyias Browning is one of the few survivors from that U18s who remains with the Blues – and for good reason. Eligible for both England and China, through his grandfather, Browning is considered a hot prospect at Everton.\n\nBlues boss Roberto Martinez recently singled out the youngster as one player who could feature in the first team next term. A talented right-back who can also operate comfortably in the heart of the defence, the 19-year-old made nine appearances for the young Blues side in that 2011 success. Browning is yet to make his first team bow, though, he impressed on a short loan spell at Wigan last season.\n\nLatics boss Uwe Rossler was even quoted as saying “Tyias came here highly recommended and he has definitely impressed me”. At the end of season awards evening Browning was awarded U21s Player of the Season – an indication of his rapid progress. And having made his debut for the England U21 set-up in the prestigious Toulon Tournament last week, his 80 minute performance is just another sign of the rapid development this young star is making.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Left Back Age: 21 Birthplace: Harrogate Current Club: Everton\n\nAnother talent to not just survive but also thrive following the U18s triumph, Luke Garbutt is another young prospect earmarked for first team opportunities next season. Initially signed from Leeds United in 2009, the highly rated defender is a rare talent. Utilised mainly at left-back, the 21-year-old is also adept in central defence and in midfield.\n\n‌\n\nGarbutt has made two first team appearances but it was during loan spells at Cheltenham Town and Colchester United that the youngster excelled. After turning out 36 times for Town in the 2011/12 campaign, Garbutt (left) was instrumental in guiding the Robins to the League Two play-off final. Last term he switched to United and during 20 appearances he was booked four times.\n\nMartinez said of this: “the yellow cards show you he has been getting really stuck into his defensive duties”. It doesn’t end there, though, as just last week Garbutt put in a gallant display on his England U21 debut in a 3-1 European qualifier win against Wales.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Left Back Age: 21 Birthplace: Southport Current Club: Brentford\n\nConsidering Jake Bidwell started out as a goalkeeper, he has made the transition to playing at left back relatively simple. Having joined the Blues academy aged 11 as a keeper, he left two-years later before rejoining soon afterwards as an outfield player.\n\nTransition completed, Bidwell captained the young Blues to the national title making a total of 19 appearances and his displays - said to show a maturity beyond his years – earned him the title honour of Academy Player of the Year in 2011. There was much promise surrounding Bidwell, who became the Blues youngest ever player in Europe at 16 years and 271 days in a dead rubber against FC Bate Borisov in 2009.\n\n‌\n\nThat, however, was to be his only first team appearance and toward the end of 2011, Bidwell was shipped out on loan to Brentford. The Former England youth international went on to play 25 games for the Bees before another successful loan spell led to a permanent switch to Griffin Park where he signed permanently last summer.\n\nPosition: Central Defence Age: 20 Birthplace: Cheltenham Current Club: Sporting Lisbon\n\n‌\n\nEric Dier is a product of Sporting Lisbon’s academy in Portugal. Cheltenham born, Dier moved over there when he was seven. He is what you would call a traditional English centre back. Competitive, a good reader of the game and comfortable on the ball, he has become a mainstay in a side that brought Cristiano Ronaldo to the global stage.\n\nDier was moved on loan to the Blues in 2010 to grow in a more competitive and demanding environment. Under David Moyes, he had been expected to force his way into the first team but didn’t make a single appearance. He did, however, represent the U18s side on ten occasions, scoring against Liverpool in a 4-0 win, before cutting short what ultimately proved to be a frustrating loan spell.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Attacking Midfielder Age: 22 Birthplace: Bootle Current Club: Sheffield United\n\nThe intriguing case of Jose Baxter – one tale that still seems to bemuse many Blues supporters. From teenage sensation to unemployed footballer, it’s been quite a journey for the man once dubbed the ‘New Wayne Rooney’. And Baxter is something of a warning. Having broken almost every club record at youth level much was promised of the young striker.\n\n‌\n\nAlthough he only made one appearance in that triumphant title-winning season, it produced a goal and stark example of the quality he possessed. But in the following year a blossoming career came to a grinding halt.\n\nThe decision to reject David Moyes’ offer to stay at the Blues looked like backfiring as the first eight weeks of the campaign went by as he sat slumped on his parents’ sofa. However, after a helping hand from his old reserve boss Alan Stubbs, he was able to kick start his career, first at Oldham and now at Sheffield United – a side he guided to the FA Cup semi-final this season.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Midfield Age: 21 Birthplace: London Current Club: AFC United (Sweden)\n\nThe then 15-year-old Femi Orenuga became the youngest player ever to play for Southend – granted it was for a single minute coming on as a substitute but it was enough to alert David Moyes. In 2009 a fee of around £30,000 was agreed between the two clubs and he promptly went into the U18s team.\n\nMuch was being made of his prospects but at 18 there were worrying signs when Orenuga failed to breakthrough to the reserves when a certain 17-year-old Ross Barkley was on the fringes of the senior side. He made 11 appearances for the young Blues in the title-winning campaign and a loan spell at Notts County was next up for the youngster.\n\n‌\n\nHe only made two substitute appearances during a month long loan and was then released from Everton. Another promising star had faded and Orenuga now plays for Stockholm side AFC United.\n\nPosition: Central Midfield Age: 22 Birthplace: Liverpool Current Club: Fleetwood (Suspended)\n\n‌\n\nBanned for two years for testing positive for anabolic steroids, Gerard Kinsella’s professional career is hanging by a thread. In June 2013, Kinsella was handed the suspension after admitting to having been administered two injections of what was, unbeknown to him, Nandrolone.\n\nThe banned substance was given to him by his cousin Neil Kinsella to help with a catalogue of shoulder injuries that drove the 22-year-old to depression. Kinsella’s injury woes began after he was given a professional contract with the Blues at the age of 16. A chipped ankle bone and torn ankle ligaments in 2007 kept him out for six months, a broken metatarsal and three left shoulder dislocations between 2009 and 2011 caused him to miss 10 months.\n\nHe was able to make ten appearances for the young Blues during the title success, but he was released by the Toffees a year later and then suffered a knee injury while on trial at Plymouth, leaving him out of work for the whole of the 2011/12 season and in the grip of depression. He secured a trial at Fleetwood and signed a two-year- contract but has yet to play for them and dislocated his shoulder twice more before he was handed the suspension.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Central Midfield Age: 19 Birthplace: Ormskirk Current Club: Rhyl\n\nTom Molyneux featured just once for the U18s side in the title-winning season but his story is an interesting one nonetheless. Now at Welsh club Rhyl, Molyneux was considered a promising young midfielder for the Blues.\n\n‌\n\nHis leadership qualities earned him the captaincy for the youth team for the 2012/13 season before he was released. But at the backend of 2012, Molyneux was involved in a car crash while making his way to the club’s training ground, Finch Farm. The car was a write off but luckily the then academy coach and Blues legend, Duncan Ferguson, who was also making his way to the training ground, stopped at the scene.\n\n‘Big Dunc’ stopped to see if he could help and he stayed with the teenager while the ambulance arrived and went to hospital with him. Fortunately, the young player escaped with minor injuries.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Striker Age: 21 Birthplace: Liverpool Current Club: Everton\n\nInjuries have plagued this young man’s promising career so far. McAleny has been with the Blues since the age of 11 and played an integral role in the U18s success. In 12 appearances for the side that season, the striker notched four crucial goals, including a last minute winner against Aston Villa in the League Play-Off semi-final.\n\nTwo first team appearances followed with his debut coming off the bench against Arsenal in the 2011/12 season. In the dying moments of that game he came close to becoming an instant hero, striking an impressive half-volley just wide of the post. A couple of minutes against Norwich the next weekend followed but McAleny found his opportunities limited as David Moyes preferred to use experience rather than youth.\n\n‌\n\nA loan spell at League One side Scunthorpe United brought more first team football but that was cut short by a season ending knee injury. An ankle injury at the beginning of the next season restricted him further but despite a scoring comeback for the U21s in a 5-2 win over Bolton it would not be enough to put him back in touch with the senior side.\n\nLoaned out to Brentford for the the new League One campaign, he broke his leg after a heavy challenge from Walsall’s Adam Chambers four games in, but he marked his return to fitness by being named as an unused substitute for an FA Cup tie at Stevenage in late January.\n\n‌\n\nPosition: Striker Age: 20 Birthplace: Liverpool Current Club: Blackburn\n\nTony Montana, as he was nicknamed at Everton, was the second top goalscorer for the young Blues in the 2010/11 season notching eight goals in 24 appearances. Forrester was tipped to make a break into the senior squad. But with other talented forwards at the club, Forrester never got his opportunity.\n\nA successful trial at Blackburn Rovers in 2013 led to the striker making a permanent switch that year. He went on to score four goals in his first four reserve-team outings for Rovers and a first team debut soon followed. Last season he turned out for League Two side Bury on loan and scored six goals in 28 appearances.\n\n‌\n\nMore on EFC today:\n\nEverton keen on Cleverley but will not sell McCarthy to clinch any deal\n\nRoyal Blue: Season to forget but don't write off Pienaar"
