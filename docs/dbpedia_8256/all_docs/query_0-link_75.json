        "text": "Dominic Fifield\n\nBest goal Nedum Onuoha's solo effort for Sunderland at Stamford Bridge, so unlikely both in its source and its clinical execution. Chelsea's campaign did not recover from the shock for almost two months.\n\nBest match Either of the north London derbies, though probably Spurs' 3-2 win at the Emirates felt the more jaw-dropping.\n\nBest player Edwin van der Sar, a 40-year-old who will be sorely missed at Manchester United. Consistently excellent.\n\nBest manager Roy Hodgson at West Bromwich Albion, overseeing safe passage into mid-table when they had appeared to be unravelling under the previous regime. Hodgson at Liverpool probably wouldn't warrant quite as much praise.\n\nBest signing Javier Hernández. His impact, both in terms of his own goals and the partnership he struck with Wayne Rooney, injected momentum into Manchester United's campaign while the other contenders faltered.\n\nBiggest flop Joe Cole, Liverpool, if largely as I tipped him to be the bargain of the season. He may have been free but he was sent off on debut, with missed penalties and injuries contributing to a negligible impact: he is synonymous with Hodgson's all too brief tenure at Anfield.\n\nBest pundit David Pleat for all-round knowledge and Pat Nevin for some sense of perspective.\n\nMain gripe Chelsea's willingness to discard Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season A clampdown on clubs being able to subsidise the wages of players loaned out. The club doing the borrowing should pay the full wage package. Inevitably, that will not be possible in many cases and may see Premier League sides reconsider before stockpiling players.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? The fact that the quality at the top end may have slipped slightly has actually improved competition, so yes.\n\nBarry Glendenning\n\nBest goal Nedum Onuoha's twinkle-toed solo effort for Sunderland in their shock win over Chelsea. Not bad for a defender.\n\nBest match Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal. Few things are more amusing than seeing Newcastle go 4-0 down inside half an hour. Watching Arsenal blow a four-goal lead is one of them.\n\nBest player Luka Modric, Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBest manager Ian Holloway, for keeping Blackpool in with a decent chance of staying up until the last 15 minutes of the season.\n\nBest signing Amid all the entirely justified praise for Javier Hernández, it's easy to forget that West Bromwich striker Peter Odemwingie cost £5m less and has scored more goals for a considerably poorer team.\n\nBiggest flop Joe Cole, Liverpool.\n\nBest pundit Pat Nevin, Five and Radio Five Live.\n\nMain gripe Whether they're targeting players, managers, match officials, pundits, presenters, journalists or fellow fans, the amount of football-related poison posted anonymously on the internet by mouth-foaming keyboard warriors with no sense of perspective has become as tedious as it used to be amusing.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season Introduce a winter break. Players aren't the only people who could do with a two-week mid-season breather.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Depends on your definition of the word \"best\". In terms of excitement and unpredictability, it's not even the best league in England.\n\nAndy Hunter\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney's overhead kick against Manchester City. In execution, timing, occasion and significance it was a goal you dreamt about as a kid. And still do as an adult.\n\nBest match Wigan 3-2 West Ham. More at stake for both teams than Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal and, as Roberto Martínez said afterwards, it felt like giving birth.\n\nBest player Nemanja Vidic, Manchester United. The most consistent and influential defender in the division.\n\nBest manager Would have been nice to say Ian Holloway for keeping Blackpool up but has to be Sir Alex Ferguson instead.\n\nBest signing Javier Hernández. Under-the-radar signing who was instrumental in the destiny of the title. Edges out Luis Suárez on that basis.\n\nBiggest flop Fernando Torres. £50m move to Chelsea revealed he wasn't sulking at Liverpool. He was shot.\n\nBest pundit Graeme Souness, now that he has brought his RTE game to these shores.\n\nMain gripe How the grubby scramble for the money that determines a club's Premier League position leads to reputations, loyalty and the interests of supporters falling by the wayside. Thinking Blackburn, John Williams and Venky's here.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season Interpol taking an interest in Fifa.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Yes, but then I don't watch the other 200-plus leagues in the world. A daft question.\n\nDavid Hytner\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney's derby winner had the lot, not least that jaw-dropping quality of all great goals.\n\nBest match Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal. Teams simply do not come back from four-goal deficits, particularly against Big Four members. Arsenal's capitulation advertised their brittleness.\n\nBest player Luka Modric. Gareth Bale was not even Tottenham's player of the season so it was mystifying how Modric could miss out on the short lists for the individual awards. The Croat is a joy to watch every week.\n\nBest manager Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nBest signing Luis Suárez. The Uruguayan already looks a bargain and has allowed Liverpool fans to dream of a challenge next season.\n\nBiggest flop Sébastien Squillaci. When he plays, Arsenal's defence is always liable to do something stupid.\n\nBest pundit Graeme Souness. Hard to fault his logic.\n\nMain gripe Why, oh why, can referees not go public to explain their controversial decisions? It would surely dilute much of the hand-wringing that can go on for days.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season Goalline technology needs to come in. It would only take 10 seconds.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Yes. Be honest, how much of La Liga, when Barcelona or Real Madrid are not involved, do you actually see? And does it really stir your passions? The Premier League holds me in thrall, more than its chief rival in Spain.\n\nJamie Jackson\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney, v Manchester City. After 78 minutes United's No10 floated into the air to unload a devastating scissor-kick that was a sensual experience for scorer and all witnesses.\n\nBest match Blackpool 4-3 Bolton Wanderers. 2-2 after 24 minutes, this late season epic ended with Charlie Adam's killer left foot grabbing an exhilarating win.\n\nBest player Jack Wilshere. From the moment he entered at half-time for England under-21s against Lithuania last September to turn the game, the midfield prodigy kept on getting better. And better.\n\nBest manager Ian Holloway. The Jackson Pollock witterings can be one-note but always worth a listen for that one nugget of counter-intuitive back-street wisdom.\n\nBest signing Rafael van der Vaart. Harry Redknapp detests his reputation as a crafty transfer trader. But after picking up a Dutch maestro who scored 13 goals in 28 league appearances for only £8m, who cares?\n\nBiggest flop Fernando Torres. Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, has displayed a lighter touch than a striker who has scored once since costing Chelsea £50m in January: just not good enough.\n\nBest pundit Robbie Savage. Can be particularly annoying yet \"Lily\" genuinely seems not give a flying throw-in who he upsets.\n\nMain gripe Cosying up to Sir Alex Ferguson. The Scot is a genius with players but it has become an unfortunate habit of his managerial rivals to overdo the deferential stuff.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season One more team in the Premier League. The entertainment never stops so can we have an extra team promoted please to extend the value?\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Yes. A compelling soap opera that is as fun off the pitch as on. A league that rocks.\n\nStuart James\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney's brilliantly executed overhead kick against Manchester City. Made an incredibly difficult skill look effortlessly easy.\n\nBest match Newcastle United 4-4 Arsenal. Cheik Tioté's superb goal capped the mother of all comebacks.\n\nBest player Charlie Adam. To score 12 goals from midfield in a relegated team is a remarkable achievement. Where Blackpool's talisman goes next and how he fares will be fascinating to follow.\n\nBest manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Didier Deschamps was right about United lacking \"fantasy\", which makes Ferguson's achievement this season even greater.\n\nBest signing Peter Odemwingie. The Albion striker was signed for £2.5m or, to put it another way, 5% of the cost of Fernando Torres, yet he finished as the fifth highest scorer in the Premier League with 15 goals.\n\nBiggest flop Fernando Torres. What on earth was Roman Abramovich thinking of paying such a ridiculous sum of money for a player who had looked out of form and out of sorts long before he showed up at Stamford Bridge?\n\nBest pundit Graeme Souness. Offers decent analysis as well as an opinion, which is more than can be said for the humdrum rubbish served up on the Match of the Day sofa most of the time.\n\nMain gripe See above. When will Match of the Day enter the 21st century?\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season More teams playing like Blackpool.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? It should be, given the amount of money pumped into it.\n\nKevin McCarra\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney's overhead kick for the winner in the Manchester derby when he had to adjust to Nani's deflected cross.\n\nBest match Arsenal's 3-3 draw at a raucous White Hart Lane felt like the death of their title bid, but it was a thrilling way to go.\n\nBest player Edwin van der Sar, Manchester United. His retirement comes while he is still at his peak.\n\nBest manager David Moyes. Everton have finished in the top half of the table for the fifth year in a row.\n\nBest signing Javier Hernández, Manchester United. He cost only £7m and has 20 goals in all competitions, with a Champions League final to come.\n\nBiggest flop Joe Cole, Liverpool. His start in Sunday's defeat to Aston Villa was his first in the Premier League since the sacking of Roy Hodgson.\n\nBest pundit Gordon Strachan. He has an original mind and looks beyond the obvious.\n\nMain gripe Luddite refusal to give officials even the option of using technology when they have not had a perfect view of an incident.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season Play-off for the last Champions League place. A guaranteed spot in the qualifying round is too great a prize just for coming fourth.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? No. Germany has both a strong fan culture and the variety that has now seen four clubs win the Bundesliga in the last five seasons.\n\nScott Murray\n\nBest goal Against Blackburn, Dimitar Berbatov set off a move in the left-back position with an insouciant flick of his boot, ambled upfield stopping only to run his fingers through his hair and stimp out a cigarette, then bashed the ball home like a film-noir private dick slugging the bad guy. The soundtrack was of ambient crowd noises, but you can bet this was playing in his head.\n\nBest match The Carling Cup final, a throwback to the 1980s when the big boys were usurped on a regular basis. When the Premier League bluster subsides, Birmingham fans will recall this season fondly for ever, having something tangible to remember it by as they do.\n\nBest player Charlie Adam, Blackpool. Not since the days of Jan Molby and Gazza has a player looked like he's put down his pie, vaulted the hoardings and pulled on his boots. A tubby genius giving hope to every dreamer in the crowd.\n\nBest manager Carlo Ancelotti took all the indignities visited upon him with grace and class. A four-time European Cup winner sacked in a corridor, for shame.\n\nBest signing Against Villa, Luis Suárez sent two players skittering off the pitch on their buttocks with one turn, a Double Puskas. His twists are giving Liverpool a sense of wonder they've been missing for years.\n\nBiggest flop Oh Fernando!\n\nBest pundit Alan Shearer. His continued employment teaches kids, teaches us all, that anything in life is possible.\n\nMain gripe It doesn't matter who's playing, Howard Webb has to be the star.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season No more demands for video technology. Moaning about poor decisions is part of the fun. The referee's supposed to be a wanker.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Ha ha ha ha.\n\nDavid Pleat\n\nBest goal Bolton's American midfielder Stuart Holden, who subsequently broke a leg, getting his reward for a lung-bursting run in the last few seconds to score after his team had apparently been deflated by a Blackburn equaliser three minutes from time.\n\nBest match Tottenham 3-3 Arsenal. Great quality amid bitter rivalry, a seesaw of emotions as Arsenal are pegged back. Harry Redknapp has helped close the gap on his neighbours with adventurous width and Luka Modric.\n\nBest player The evergreen Ryan Giggs, consistently producing high-class performances and defying his age. His 12th championship medal was a true reward for ability and dedication.\n\nBest manager \"Wrong profile\" Roy Hodgson. He coped with humbling disappointment at Liverpool amid unfair pressures to bounce back and re-emerge as a respected leader at West Bromwich Albion. Boing boing indeed.\n\nBest signing Sharp as a tack with brilliant movement to disturb much bigger defenders, Javier Hernández was an elusive scorer for the champions.\n\nBiggest flop With the burden of a £50m price tag and difficulties adjusting to a different system and new surroundings, Fernando Torres struggled to impress. But it remains early days.\n\nBest pundit Graeme Souness on Sky clearly expresses his knowledge and understanding, derived from his experiences as both a player and a manager. Aspiring pundits should listen carefully. He knows the game.\n\nMain gripe(s) Managers who continually gesture theatrically in the technical area; media programmes and pundits who trivialise the game; supporters who don't know the laws of the game.\n\nChange(s) I'd like to see for next season Review the loan system; FA must use experienced elder statesmen who have lived in the dressing room and the boardroom; and the Premier League should subsidise ticket prices: where is the next generation of players and supporters coming from?\n\nIs it the best league in the world? La Liga is us and them (Barcelona and Real Madrid). Serie A is over-praised and boring. England is so dramatic and unpredictable, it is the best and remains brilliant.\n\nRob Smyth\n\nBest goal Moments of pure Berbarotica against Everton, Liverpool and Blackburn were personal favourites, but the best is probably Johan Elmander's outrageous Kick Off 2-style turn against Wolves, which evoked the very best of Romario.\n\nBest match Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal, a deranged, once-in-a-generation classic.\n\nBest player Luka Modric, one of the most charming footballers around and that rarest of species: the box-to-box playmaker.\n\nBest manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Nobody else in football would have won the league with that squad. You'd have to be a serious plonker to write him off.\n\nBest signing Javier Hernández. Eerily mature, and with the sharpest off-the-ball movement in English football since Andy Cole.\n\nBiggest flop Stephen Ireland. A delightful footballer whose career sadly seems to be drifting away.\n\nBest pundit Marcel Desailly. He basically says nothing, but he does so with such earnest enthusiasm that you can't take your eyes off him.\n\nMain gripe The often vicious abuse of football writers on the internet is tedious and shows a sad lack of perspective.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season Increase the minimum pitch size.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? It depends how you qualify the best league. Personally, I don't think it is. The standard is higher at the top end of La Liga, while the Bundesliga is more competitive, more atmospheric, more attacking, more authentic, and more fun.\n\nDaniel Taylor\n\nBest goal Wayne Rooney's bicycle kick against Manchester City. One of those rare moments when you know you had seen something that would stay with you forever.\n\nBest match Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal. The game that can be wheeled out as Exhibit A in the argument about Arsenal not having the mental strength and know-how to win championships.\n\nBest player Charlie Adam, Blackpool\n\nBest manager Sir Alex Ferguson's a bit useful isn't he? But he always wins so, just to be adventurous/controversial, I'll nominate Roberto Mancini, for Manchester City's first trophy since 1976 and their first Champions League finish.\n\nBest signing Javier Hernández, Manchester United. Twenty goals in a debut season, with only 26 starts, all for £6m.\n\nBiggest flop Bébé (Manchester United). Someone posted on Twitter recently that he's the younger brother of Hehe, just even funnier.\n\nBest pundit Lee Dixon, Match of the Day.\n\nMain gripe Musical instruments at grounds. And those jingly-jangly themes at some grounds after goals have been scored. It's a football match, not a fairground.\n\nChange I'd like to see for next season The Premier League to come good with their promise to enforce post-match press conferences at Manchester United. But they won't.\n\nIs it the best league in the world? Yes, but I don't think this has been a classic season.\n\nLouise Taylor\n\nBest goal Cheik Tioté; stupendous long-range volley for Newcastle in 4-4 draw with Arsenal at St James' Park.\n\nBest match Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal. At one point Alan Pardew's side were 4-0 down; then came one of the great comebacks.\n\nBest player Luka Modric, Tottenham. Restores your faith in football, reminds everyone that the game really can be beautiful.\n\nBest manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Would anyone else have extracted as much from United's current squad or compensated for its deficiencies so well?\n\nBest signing Cheik Tioté: £3.5m to Newcastle from FC Twente last summer, just edges out Javier Hernández and Peter Odemwingie.\n\nBiggest flop Aleksandar Kolarov, Manchester City. Did he really cost £17m?\n\nBest pundit Garth Crooks. Combines detailed knowledge and strong opinion with burning enthusiasm.\n\nMain gripe Officials still turn far too much of a blind eye to shirt pulling, can't they see it's cheating?"
