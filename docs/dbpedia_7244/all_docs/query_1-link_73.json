        "text": "An opening onscreen credit reads: \"Associate producer Herbert G. Gelbspan, Hal Roach Studios.\" According to DV and LAEx reviews, the film was culled from 2,000 reels of Mack Sennett and Hal Roach short film comedies. The film was divided into eight acts with a prologue and finale which provided a loose chronicle of silent film comedy. The acts include the following films: Prologue: Super-Hooper-Dyne Lizzies (1925), Remember When? (1925), Angora Love (1929); Act I: The Laugh Factory: Hollywood Kid (1924), The Daredevil (1923), Wandering Willies (1926), Muscle Bound Music (1926), Wall Street Blues (1924), Circus Today (1926); Act II: Nobody Liked Them but the Public: Habeas Corpus (1928), The Second Hundred Years (1927), We Faw Down (1928), Battle of the Century (1927); Act III: The Cowboy Who Became a Legend: Going to Congress (1924), Uncensored Movies (1923), Big Moments from Little Pictures (1924); Act IV: Two Unforgettable Girls: Run, Girl, Run (1928), Double Whoopee (1929); Act V: The Great Actor: The Jolly Jilter (1927), A Harem Knight (1926), Yukon Jake (1924), Ten Dollars or Ten Days (1924), The Prodigal Bridegroom (1926); Act VI: A Comedy Classic: Two Tars (1928); Act VII: So Funny, So Sad: Luck o' the Foolish (1924); Act VIII: Animal Comedy: The Sting of Stings (1927), His Unlucky Night (1928), Nip and Tuck (1923); Finale: Two Men on a Street: You're Darn Tootin' (1927).\n\nStan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's onscreen credit reads \"Laurel and Hardy.\" The NYT review praised the release of the compilation film noting: \"Anyone who gives the public the chance to view these old movies again -- and as a consequence revives interest in the problem of saving them -- deserves an automatic debt of gratitude.\"\n\nLess\n\nThe film chronicles the variety of comedic styles and talent at the height of Hollywood’s silent era.

Act Three presents Will Rogers, who went from cowboy to philosopher and became legendary for his ability to poke fun at anyone without giving offense. In the early 1920s Rogers filmed several of his most famous skits featuring his great talent for parody. Rogers successfully mimicked the athletic Douglas Fairbanks, the daring horseback riding feats of Tom Mix and the antics of Keystone Kop Ford Sterling. Act Four reveals that two of Hollywood’s later leading ladies and deft comedians, Carole Lomabrd and Jean Harlow, got their start in comedy shorts. The young, energetic Lombard represented the flapper and youth craze of the day. A sultry, teenage Harlow made a brief but memorable appearance in a Laurel and Hardy short well before her own successful career as a screen comedian and sensational “bombshell.” Act Five shows how Sennett took advantage of the versatility of Ben Turpin and created a number of personalities for the comic, including a sophisticated playboy and a fearless stuntman. Many times Sennett and other comedy producers took advantage of real-life activities, such as fires, to film footage; Turpin proved to be at ease with the off-the-cuff improvisation these situations often required from actors. Act Six details that two future directors, Leo McCarey and George Stevens, worked on a Roach production of a Laurel and Hardy classic in which the pair, as sailors on leave, turned a country road into a massive traffic pile-up. Described as having the face of a “fiendish baby,” the funny but melancholy Harry Langdon soared to popularity in the mid-1920s with his low-key but hilarious clowning, as chronicled in Act Seven. Sadly, by the end of the silent era, Langdon’s style became passé and the actor faded into obscurity and died young. In Act Eight, Sennett is shown as recognizing the innate humor in animal behavior, especially when people and animals come together. In addition to poking fun at human-animal encounters in unusual circumstances, Sennett made a star of a terrier mix mutt named Cameo, who with Billy Bevan rose to success in exciting adventures that often included the famous Keystone Kops. The Finale is a salute to an era that utilized physical, slapstick comedy and split-second timing. The film closes with another example of Laurel and Hardy’s simple but witty tribute to the perils of everyday life.\n\nLess"
