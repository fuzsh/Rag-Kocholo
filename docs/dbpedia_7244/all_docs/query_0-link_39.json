Cast: Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Sharon Lynne, James Finlayson, Rosina Lawrence. 35mm, b/w, 65 min.\n\nIn this Academy Award-winning short, Stan and Ollie strive valiantly to deliver a piano to a home at the top of an impossibly long staircase.\n\nDirector: James Parrott. Screenwriter: H.M. Walker.
