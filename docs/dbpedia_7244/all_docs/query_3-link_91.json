Harris made a proposition to his friend Irving Berlin: if the popular songwriter would devise a musical revue, Harris would find a theatre for it. Berlin responded with The Music Box Revue and in 1920 the Music Box Theatre was built to house the show. The Shuberts began acquiring shares of the venue from Harris in the 1920s. When Harris died in 1941, his wife sold half the shares in the theatre to the Shuberts, and half to Berlin. From that point on, Berlin and Shubert became equal partners in the ownership of the house. In 2007, the Berlin share of the theatre was sold to Shubert, now the sole owner of the theatre. Because of its dainty, jewel-like qualities, the Music Box Theatre is aptly named. Designed by architect Charles Howard Crane in collaboration with E. George Kiehler, it was built in the neo-Georgian style, more in the manner of a dignified manor or country home than in the typical theatrical style of most other Broadway playhouses.\n\nThe theatre housed only musicals until 1925 when it presented its first play - Cradle Snatchers, starring Humphrey Bogart. In 1926, the Maurine Dallas Watkins play 'Chicago', which the musical was based off of, opened at the theatre. The Music Box Theatre then presented a series of hits by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart from Once in a Lifetime to The Man Who Came to Dinner.\n\nMany shows from the Music Box Theatre have also had well-known film adaptations! Les Liaisons dangereuses (on Broadway in 1987) was adapted for the screen multiple times including a Dangerous Liaisons (1988) starring Glenn Close, Keanu Reeves and Uma Thurman, and Cruel Intentions (1999) starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Philippe, and Reese Witherspoon. A Few Good Men (on Broadway in 1989) was adapted for the screen in 1992 featuring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, and Demi Moore. August: Osage County (on Broadway in 2008) was adapted for the screen in 2013. And most recently Dear Evan Hansen (now at the Music Box Theatre) was adapted for the screen in 2021.\n\nShows at the Music Box Theatre (Broadway)\n\nDATESPRODUCTION4/18/2024-Suffs (2024)9/7/2023-2/4/2024Purlie Victorious (2023)3/2/2023-5/14/2023Bob Fosse's Dancin' (2023)10/18/2022-11/20/2022Gabriel Byrne: Walking with Ghosts (2022)11/14/2016-9/18/2022Dear Evan Hansen (2016)3/15/2016-7/24/2016Shuffle Along Or The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed (2016)10/10/2015-1/31/2016King Charles III (2015)2/23/2015-5/3/2015The Heidi Chronicles (2015)5/16/2013-6/23/2013Reasons to be Happy (2013)4/10/2013-5/4/2013The Dance of Death (2013)3/23/2013-1/4/2015Pippin (2013)11/27/2012-12/23/2012Volpone (2012)11/5/2012-1/6/2013Dead Accounts (2012)4/6/2012-9/2/2012One Man, Two Guvnors (2012)2/14/2012-3/4/2012Shatner's World: We Just Live In It (2012)1/31/2012-4/22/2012Carrie (2012)11/6/2011-12/31/2011Private Lives (2011)9/8/2011-10/22/2011The Submission (2011)4/2/2011-8/21/2011Jerusalem (2011)3/11/2011-4/24/2011The Other Place (2011)1/6/2011-2/26/2011The New York Idea (2011)10/28/2010-12/22/2010The Break of Noon (2010)9/23/2010-1/9/2011La Bete (2010)7/8/2010-8/13/2010We the People: America Rocks!
