        "text": "Thanks to film archivist Michael Agee, fans of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy can enjoy the legendary comedy team getting themselves into more fine messes.\n\nThe two-reelers (Oscar-winning Leo McCarey was the supervising director on most) are hysterically funny. The prints are of good-to-excellent quality and each comedy features the original sound effects and music.Agee, who restored the Laurel and Hardy talkies that are on video, has spent the past two years restoring 24 more Laurel and Hardy films produced by Hal Roach Studios in the late 1920s. The \"lost\" films - 22 of which are silents - haven't been seen in more than 60 years.\n\nEight titles - \"That's My Wife,\" \"Their Purple Moment,\" \"They Go Boom!,\" \"Big Business,\" \"Liberty,\" \"You're Darn Tootin',\" \"Two Tars\" and \"Double Whoopee\" - are available from Fast Forward Video ($10 each). Eight more comedies, plus several compilation videos ($20 each) will be available Sept. 15. Included in that batch will be \"Unaccustomed as We Are,\" their first talkie.\n\nThe highlights:\n\n- \"Their Purple Moment\": The boys play hen-pecked hubbies who decide to have a night on the town and go to a \"bowling alley,\" only to end up at a fancy restaurant with two good-time gals. Watch the expression on Laurel's face when he realizes he has no money.\n\n- \"Double Whoopee\": Laurel and Hardy play a hotel's footman and doorman who accidentally rip off the dress of a society woman (an 18-year-old Jean Harlow).\n\n- \"That's My Wife\": Laurel must pretend to be Hardy's husband to appease Hardy's rich uncle. A slapstick gem.\n\nThe only disappointment is \"They Go Boom!\": An early talkie in which Laurel and Hardy seem encumbered by the dialogue.\n\n\"It's as if Laurel and Hardy came back and made 24 films,\" said Agee, president of Nostalgia Archive LTD.\n\n\"Once sound came in (these movies) were pretty much forgotten,\" Agee explained. \"When Hal Roach Studios sold them (in the late '60s) to the person I finally acquired them from, there weren't any intact elements. There were pieces of them.\"\n\nAfter Agee acquired the rights two years ago, he went on a search to restore the films. \"There's a man named Robert Youngson who made a series of really fine compilation features during the '50s and '60s like `The Golden Age of Comedy,' \" Agee says. \"I managed to track down the contents of Robert Youngson's vault. What Youngson did was copy sections of the original camera negative in the '50s and '60s, but it was extremely irritating because he copied maybe 85 percent of the title.\"\n\nThe Library of Congress also housed some elements from the Hal Roach collection. \"They had been preserving portions throughout the years,\" Agee says. \"They had preserved enough. I was able to take that with things I was able to get through collections from the country and around the world.\"\n\nVIDEO QUESTION\n\nQuestion: Sometimes when I use the still frame on my VCR, the picture is clear, but at other times there are wide white horizontal bars. Why is this happening and is there something wrong with my VCR?\n\nAnswer: It's doubtful there is anything wrong. The bands occur because of size differences between the video heads of your VCR and the video heads that made the original recording. For example, narrow heads create narrow video tracks. When played back by wider heads, the \"overlap\" appears as bars of static. You've probably noticed that on tapes you've made yourself, the still frame is clearer. That's because the tracks are being read by the same heads that recorded them, a perfect match.\n\n- Andy Wickstrom\n\n(Knight-Ridder)\n\n- Do you have a question you'd like answered?

Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron play an American painter and a French shop assistant who fall in love despite romantic attachments with other people. While the story is decidedly commonplace, director Vincente Minnelli and producer Arthur Freed decked it out with a meticulously filmed scenic design, superb George Gershwin music and a remarkably ambitious production number that brings the picture to a delicious conclusion while showcasing the versatility of its balletically talented stars. Screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner. Winner of six Academy Awards for 1951. Not rated, MGM/UA Home Video.\n\n- David Sterritt\n\n(Christian Science Monitor)\n\nTHE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 - Paramount's \"Big Broadcast\" musical-comedy revue series, scattered through the Depression years, are always a delight to rediscover, but this one is a standout. The feature-film debut of Bob Hope, it also catches W.C. Fields approaching the peak of artistry he would reach with \"Never Give a Sucker an Even Break\" in 1941. Hope had already begun moving from radio onto the screen as a short-subject star, but \"Broadcast '38\" captured ideally his gimmick of firing off glib wisecracks while caught in dodgy situations. Here is the origin of the classic Hope-in-Hollywood personality, with a jim-dandy rendition of \"Thanks for the Memory,\" his signature tune. Long unavailable except in broadcast or bootleg form, \"Broadcast '38\" looks as though it just popped out of the lab, thanks to a primary-source digital remastering job by MCA/Universal Home Video.\n\n- Michael H. Price\n\n(Fort Worth Star-Telegram)\n\nZOOMAN - Playwright Charles Fuller (\"A Soldier's Story\") and director Leon Ichaso (\"Sugar Hill\") deliver a way-above-average social-justice thriller about a Brooklynite (Louis Gossett Jr.) who mounts a campaign to drive his daughter's killer out of hiding. Originally made for the Showtime cable-TV network. R.\n\n- Michael H. Price\n\n(Fort Worth Star-Telegram)\n\nTHE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET - Released just after the end of World War II, this 1945 thriller - about an undercover agent helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation crack a German spy ring - was one of the first movies to combine documentary-style realism with \"film noir,\" complete with authentic locations and real G-men as extras. The result is crisply entertaining, if not always as credible as director Henry Hathaway tried to make it. Not rated, Fox Video.\n\n- David Sterritt\n\n(Christian Science Monitor)"
