        "text": "FOR SOME CHILDREN, THE question is as innocent as the birds and the bees: ''What did you do in the war, Daddy?'' But for the American writer Joe Eszterhas, that question was never innocent. It was one of the central terrors of his childhood, of growing up in the shadow of the Holocaust.\n\n''I was born in a little village in Hungary toward the end of the war, and I spent the first six years of my life in British and American refugee camps,'' Mr. Eszterhas explains. ''My dad told me stories, from the time I was young, about what happened in Hungary during the war and what the Arrow Cross did. ''\n\nThe Arrow Cross was a powerful pro-Hitler Hungarian political party that collaborated with the Nazis during their occupation of Hungary in World War II, often working in tandem with the feared local gendarmes known as Csendors. Together with the Nazis, according to Mr. Eszterhas, the two groups plunged the country into a Gestapo-like reign of terror, often sweeping up Hungarian civilians and soldiers into their wave of fanaticism, anti-Semitism and mass murder, Hungary's own domestic version of Adolf Hitler's Final Solution.\n\nMr. Eszterhas is not Jewish, and he was too young to see with his own eyes what the Arrow Cross and the Csendors did. But the pain he saw in the refugee camps, plus the stories he heard from his father, were burned into his consciousness as a kind of litany: The Arrow Cross, the Csendors, the Holocaust. Long afterward, just the sound of a siren, or the mention of the Hungarian word Nyilas, meaning Arrow Cross, would make him tremble with fear. And even long after his family had moved to Ohio to start a new life in America, young Joe Eszterhas was tormented by feelings of shame and guilt, by fears that his very own flesh and blood might have committed war crimes:\n\n''For my generation of Hungarian kids,'' he recalls, ''for kids with the sensibility and sensitivity, the question 'What did you do in the war, Daddy?' was potentially the worst possible personal nightmare.''"
