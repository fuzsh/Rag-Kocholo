        "text": "The producer-director Hal Roach has been voted an hononary Academy Award for lifetime achievement, and the producer M. J. (Mike) Frankovich the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Tuesday.\n\nBoth men are scheduled to receive their awards on April 9 at the 56th annual Academy Awards ceremony at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center.\n\nMr. Roach, who is 92 years old, has won previous Oscars for his 1932 comedy short, ''The Music Box,'' and for the 1936 movie, ''Bored of Education.'' He is perhaps best known for teaming Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and for creating ''Our Gang.'' His Hal Roach Studios worked with such stars as Harold Lloyd, Harry Pollard, Will Rogers, Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts, Charlie Chase and Edgar Kennedy.\n\nMr. Frankovich's record of humanitarian activities is varied and extensive."
