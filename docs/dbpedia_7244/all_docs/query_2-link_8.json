        "text": "Harry Eugene Roach Snr. (January 14, 1892 – November 2, 1992) was an American film and television producer, director, and actor who is best known today for producing the Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang film comedy series. I am indebted to Richard W Bann for his significant input into this article . Mike Jones\n\nHal Roach was born in Elmira, New York, the grandson of Irish immigrants. Randy Skretvedt tells us ”His mother wanted a girl and was going to name her Harriet, in honor of her own mother. After the boy was born, she still wanted to name him Harriet, but cooler heads prevailed and he was named Harry. Young Roach didn’t care for this and later had it legally changed to Hal.”\n\nHe both knew and was inspired by American humourist Mark Twain as a young grade school student, for whom he made deliveries.\n\nAfter working all over the U.S., including Alaska, Roach arrived in Hollywood in 1912 seeking work as an extra in silent films, realising quite quickly that this new medium was what he wanted to be involved in. Using a small inheritance, he began producing short film comedies in 1915 with his friend Harold Lloyd, who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke.\n\nRoach married actress Marguerite Nichols in September 1916 and two children followed: Hal Jnr. on June 15, 1918 and Margaret M. Roach on March 15, 1921. Both would predecease their father by many years; Hal Jnr died on March 29, 1972 and Margaret on November 22, 1964. Sadly, after almost 25 years of marriage Marguerite died in March 1941.\n\nHe married for a second time on September 1 1942, to Lucille Prin, a Los Angeles secretary, at Wright-Patterson Airfield in Dayton, Ohio, where Roach was stationed while serving as a major in the United States Army Air Corps. Roach and Lucille had four children, Elizabeth Carson Roach on December 26, 1945, Maria May Roach on April 14, 1947, Jeanne Alice Roach on October 7, 1949, and Kathleen Bridget Roach on January 29, 1951. Tragically, Elizabeth lived for less than a year.\n\nFounded in 1914 and originally based in studios in Downtown Los Angeles, the original name for Roach’s company was ‘Rolin’, named for ROach and his financial backer Dan LINthicum.\n\nAfter a number of profitable years, Hal Roach purchased the land on Washington Blvd, Culver City from Harry Culver on which his new studio would be built in 1919. Changing the name of the company to ‘The Hal Roach Studios’, he continued to employ Harold Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923) as well as Will Rogers, Max Davidson, the Our Gang kids, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts, Lupe Vélez, Patsy Kelly and most famously, Laurel and Hardy.\n\nIn 1920, as noted Roach formed a new company called “Hal Roach Studios” and a new era began. his newly built studio consisted of the administration building, a large open stage and an enclosed stage, a storage building for sets and costumes, a film laboratory and department bungalows. There was also a back lot with various types of sets that would be used over and over again.\n\nIn May 1920, a water tank was installed along with some other departmental buildings. This tank would be named ‘Lake Laurel and Hardy’ in December 1954.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Roach’s biggest rival was producer Mack Sennett, however, in what would prove a masterstroke, Roach poached Sennett’s supervising director F. Richard ‘Dick’ Jones in 1925.\n\nIn May of 1923, Hal Roach purchased a 10-acre ranch near the to studio, at what is now Robertson Blvd, where he shot films ‘on location’, including Way Out West.\n\nSound Arrives\n\nReleasing his films through Pathé Exchange until 1927, he then moved distribution to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The Roach studio was converted to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. Laurel and Hardy’s Unaccustomed as We Are being the first.\n\nForeign language versions of some Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film variously in Spanish, French, and occasionally Italian and German. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase and even the Our Gang kids – some of whom had barely started school – read the foreign dialogue phonetically, usually from cue cards held out of sight of the cameras.\n\nWhile many silent stars didn’t make the transition from silent to sound movies, most – if not all – at the ‘Lot of Fun’ did so as the studio adopted the medium relatively early and understood how to optimise the new opportunity to thrill their audience. Laurel and Hardy positively thrived with the introduction of sound with their work going from strength to strength as they very quickly understood how to maximise laughs using careful editing and clever sound effects.\n\nIn 1931, Roach began producing occasional full-length sound features, the first being the Laurel & Hardy film Pardon Us, while continuing with short films too. One of these, Laurel and Hardy’s The Music Box, won an Academy Award for best short subject of 1932.\n\nShort subjects became less profitable though, and were pretty much phased out by 1936, other than the Our Gang series. Laurel and Hardy’s last short for Roach was Thicker than Water (1935).\n\nIts interesting to note that Roach had no interest in the past – as soon as a picture was complete he moved on to the next one. When asked to discuss a specific entry in later years, he would not be able to remember it by its title, though he would recall the production from the plot!\n\nStan and Hal Roach often fell out, initially at the time of Babes in Toyland when they disagreed over the script. Roach largely agreed with what Stan wanted, but he was of course beholding to his distributor. One thing that rankled was that Stan and Babe had signed for Roach at different times so they were on separate contracts. These invariably ran over different timescales, so they were never able to negotiate as ‘Laurel and Hardy’ and strike a deal that would deliver a larger slice of the revenue that their work was generating (despite the fact that Roach was paying Stan more than he paid himself!)\n\nRichard W Bann covers their relationship between Stan and Hal Roach in detail in the wonderful Podcast in the Laurel an Hardy Blog on Their Purple Moment which you can access here.\n\nIn order to placate Stan, Roach would occasionally give him sweeteners such as producer – ‘A Stan Laurel Production’ – which he did for both Our Relations and Way Out West. While merely a title – Stan was always involved in virtually every aspect of his pictures – is of no real surprise that both of these features are arguably among the best made by Laurel and Hardy.\n\nControversially, in 1937, Roach started a joint business venture with Vittorio Mussolini, son of fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, forming a production company called ‘R.A.M’ (Roach and Mussolini), though it is apparent that Mussolini was the main initiator, and the deal was signed off by MGM representative in Europe, Laudy Lawrence. Roach actually thought he was acting in a fashion that would benefit MGM, understanding the venture involved Italian bankers providing $6m that would enable him to produce a series of 12 films, eight for Italian screening and the other four for worldwide distribution. The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera Rigoletto.\n\nHowever, head of Loew’s, Nick Schenk, who controlled MGM at the time was less than happy with this and demanded Roach pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, along with the poor performance of much of his new feature output (Laurel & Hardy films aside), ultimately led to the end of the relationship with MGM. In May 1938, Roach sold MGM the production rights and actors’ contracts for Our Gang in the process. He then signed with United Artists who would distribute his future productions.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Roach focussed on producing glossy features, abandoning his area of expertise – simple comedy – instead making sophisticated farces (like Topper, 1937, and The Housekeeper’s Daughter, 1939) or action fare (like Captain Fury, 1939, and One Million B.C., 1940). Roach’s one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed Of Mice and Men in 1939 in which actors Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jnr. played the leading roles.\n\nLaurel and Hardy comedies, for years the studio’s biggest income stream, were becoming the studio’s least important production and the last one – Saps at Sea was released in May 1940.\n\nRoach then experimented with medium-length featurettes, running 40 – 50 minutes. ‘Streamliners’, as he called them, were used in double-feature presentations and distributors also used these to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach’s streamliners through to 1943. By this time though, Roach no longer had a resident ‘stock’ company’ and was forced to cast his films with unfamiliar and often unknown featured players.\n\nWorld War II\n\nHal Roach had joined the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927 and was called back to active military duty in June 1942, at age 50. The ‘Lot of Fun’ began producing military training films and was leased to the U.S. Army Air Forces, making 400 training, morale and propaganda films at ‘Fort Roach’. Members of the unit included Ronald W. Reagan and Alan Ladd. After the war, the government returned the studio to Roach with millions of dollars worth of apparent ‘improvements’ that Roach was not at all pleased about.\n\nIn 1943, he approved licensing revivals of his sound-era productions though was unaware of the details of the contract as he was serving at the time. The contract was not as good a deal that Roach himself would have negotiated and this ended in litigation. Both theatrical and home-movie distribution channels were exploited and the Roach back catalogue was also an early arrival on television.\n\nTelevision\n\nIn 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, where he was the first Hollywood producer to exclusively produce in colour. However, this did not lead to increased revenue despite the increased production costs. In 1948, now deeply in debt, Roach turned to television production with son Hal Roach Jnr. Ironically producing series such as The Abbott and Costello Show, who had followed on the coat-tails of Laurel and Hardy, but with much less finesse or subtlety. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year.\n\nIn 1954, Hal Jr offered Laurel and Hardy Feature productions the opportunity to make a series of hour long specials to be known ad Laurel and Hardy’s Fabulous fables. Just before filming was to commence, Stan suffered a stroke (from which he would make a full recovery). During his convalescence, however Babe also became seriously ill and the plans were shelved and ultimately cancelled.\n\nThe Laurel and Hardy sound catalogue was a big success in television syndication, as were the Our Gang comedies originally produced from 1927-1938. Roach had bought back the rights for the latter from MGM in 1949 and renamed them as ‘The Little Rascals’ for the television audience.\n\nIn 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, Hal Roach Jnr., and essentially retired. Unfortunately, the younger Roach lacked much of his father’s business skills, the studios struggled and in April of 1959, the Hal Roach Studios became insolvent and were forced to close. Hal Snr. came back to try and get the studio up and running again but by December of 1962 the studio was permanently closed.\n\nThe 92-year-old Roach was presented with an honorary Academy Award in 1984, presented by former Our Gang members Jackie Cooper and George “Spanky” McFarland. He continued to work as a consultant on projects related to his past work, even contemplating a comedy comeback at 96. On 21 January 1992, just days after his 100th birthday, Roach was a guest on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show, where he recounted experiences with such stars as Stan Laurel and Jean Harlow; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance.\n\nAt the 64th Academy Awards ceremony on March 30, 1992 hosted by Billy Crystal, Roach was in the audience. When he rose to acknowledge a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone. Crystal remarked “I think that’s appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.”\n\nHal Eugene Roach Snr. died at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, from pneumonia on November 2, 1992, at the age of 100 years. He married twice, had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. He survived three of his children: (Hal Jnr. died in 1972, Margaret in 1964, and Elizabeth in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films. Roach is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York, where he grew up.\n\nHe left us a legacy of some of the finest comedy films ever made, both in the silent and sound eras. Hal E Roach was and will be remembered as a true Hollywood giant.\n\nHal Roach Studios\n\nThe 14.5 acre studio that would become known as ‘The Lot of Fun’, began construction in early 1919 on land Roach purchased from Harry Culver at 8822 West Washington Blvd, Culver City, Los Angeles. The studio ultimately had 55 buildings, and was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as “Landmark Studios”),\n\nThe Roach Studios continued making feature films into the 1940s until the take-over by the Army-Air Force, nicknaming it ‘Fort Roach’ making training and propaganda films.\n\nFollowing the war, the Roach Studios resumed its feature film production activity with the construction of new stages and facilities but, in April of 1959, under the management of Hal Jnr, the Hal Roach Studios was closed due to bankruptcy. Hal, Snr. came back to try and get the studio rolling again, but by December of 1962, the studio was permanently closed. In August 1963, the studio was finally demolished after several auctions and sales of the company’s assets.\n\nMost of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that maintained the “Hal Roach Studios” name where in 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of film ‘colorization’. It began creating digitally coloured versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the first being Way Out West.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times and in that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios was established, though Hal himself had no involvement since he sold his stake in 1971. This new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from the original Roach archive, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available 35 mm elements.\n\nToday, Culver City’s Landmark Street runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot; the two original sound stages were located on the north side of what is now Landmark Street, and the backlot of street sets were at the eastern end of Landmark Street. As noted, the plaque was unveiled in 1980 by The Sons of the Desert in a small park across from the studio’s location in the shadow of a metroliner train track."
