        "text": "For whatever reason, there was a one-night-only screening at the Alamo Drafthouse last Tuesday of a 4K restoration of Hong Kong filmmaker Ann Hui’s 2002 drama July Rhapsody. My husband is an especially great admirer of Hui’s films, and I’m always eager to see more of them, so to the Drafthouse we went.\n\nThe film has Hui’s characteristically quiet grace as it follows a schoolteacher, Lam, who, in the throes of a midlife crisis, develops feelings for a student. But there’s more than meets the eye to this almost peculiarly unassuming family drama. Lam is a teacher of ancient Chinese literature with a personal interest in poetry, and it’s this passion that underlies the otherwise prosaic and potentially sensationalistic happenings—and Hui balances these conflicting modes exquisitely. To convey all of this, Hui employs a delicate flashback structure that evokes the past and present concurrently. There’s also an element of national identity that makes this deceptively plain film a multilayered consideration of everyday life and the various elements—the poetry, essentially—that suffuse it.\n\nOn Wednesday, I went to see the Highs & Lows revenge-driven double feature of Abel Ferrara’s Ms. 45 (1981) and Jack Hill’s Blaxploitation classic Coffy (1973) at the Music Box Theatre. Ms. 45 stars Zoë Tamerlis Lund as a mute New York City garment worker who’s raped twice in one day, after which she goes on an all-male killing spree. It’s decidedly sinister and intense—though both in a “good” way, as it’s a masterwork of a film and a high point of exploitation cinema in particular—while Coffy is somewhat lighter, owing to Pam Grier’s “kick ass, take names, and look amazing while doing so” character. Thus, the Coffy chaser was much needed after the particular brutality of Ms. 45, but both are visions to behold on the big screen, and the connection between them leaves much to consider long after viewing.\n\nI was again taken with a film by Agnieszka Holland—A Woman Alone (1981, sometimes translated as A Lonely Woman), which screened at Doc Films on Saturday. Going back to my assertion last week that Holland’s films are brutal, this may be even more so than Ms. 45 or Coffy, as it follows a single mother in communist Poland whose myriad problems are relentless. There’s no revenge to be had here, just bitter acceptance of life’s cruelty. These three films track the plight of women in oppressive circumstances, and while it can be cathartic and even fun to watch them get revenge, it’s all the more sobering to realize those scenarios are often based solely in the alternate reality afforded by cinematic invention.\n\nI watched another Polish film, Krzysztof Zanussi’s The Structure of Crystal (1969), before it expired on Mubi; like July Rhapsody, it’s more cerebral than reactive. In the film, two friends, both physicists, reunite after a time apart at the rural cottage of one of the men, where he works as a local meteorologist. The other is more of a hotshot and is visiting partly as a ploy to get his friend back into the more glamorous world of Big Science.\n\nThe Structure of Crystal predates the cinema of moral concern that defined the most potent of Polish films starting in 1976. Its considerations, then, are less explicitly morality focused in that it’s centered on the idea of vocation and what makes for a meaningful life. That’s definitely something this writer can relate to, as I just recently crossed into the second half of my 30s and am wondering what the future holds. Whatever it is, I’m sure it will include cinema.\n\nUntil next time, moviegoers."
