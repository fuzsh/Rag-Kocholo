        "text": "As the Academy Awards, the Super Bowl for film lovers, takes place tonight, it only fitting that today’s short is a past Oscar winner. The very first film to win an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film, The Music Box, is a nice reminder of how far short films, and comedy in general, has evolved over the years. Directed by James Parrott, this 1932 comedic gem involves two deliverymen struggling to push a large crated piano up a seemingly insurmountable flight of stairs. The Music Box not only propelled Laurel and Hardy into stardom, but the film was also selected for preservation in the prestigious United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1997.\n\nThe Music Box\n\nDirector: James Parrott / USA/ 1932 /28 minutes\n\nStarring: Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy"
