        "text": "I bought this set about a year and a half ago. Reading this thread has reminded me that I need to dig this out and do some binge-watching!\n\nIIRC, for some reason \"We Faw Down\" had the original Victor score (not included on the US Lost Films version), and \"The Chimp\" had original titles, in both cases on the German release but not the UK one (which had a Beau Hunks score and Film Classics titles respectively). Other than that, I think they were mostly the same, though I think the German set had more various \"pre-team\" Roach silents with Stan or Babe in them (Charley Chase and others) than the UK set.\n\nBy the way -- I note a lot of the silents on the European releases seem to have \"recreated\" opening titles -- like for instance \"You're Darn Tootin\" and \"The Finishing Touch\" are two that had the original title cards on the US releases (so they can be compared), but the German and UK releases appear to have remade titles, but very close if not identical to the originals. (I would guess they did this because the original footage was in such a bad state of preservation.) The European DVDs included a version of \"Brats\" with the original music score, and what looked like original titles (with original audio including both the circa 1930 musical fanfare and the audio of the roaring lion simultaneously, which seems like an oddity for shorts of this era) but then the \"target practice\" introductory title looked like it was remade (as were many \"The End\" titles on various shorts). The later US box set has a choice for either the familiar \"reissue soundtrack\" or original audio for \"Brats,\" but both versions have identical visuals (and therefore both have the picture portion of the reissue titles). I wonder if the European \"original 1930\" title sequence for \"Brats\" could actually be a very good recreation? I note the US set also has the 1929 audio track for \"Perfect Day\" with no musical score, and the video portion is also identical to the one with the reissue audio (that way they don't have to author two separate video files of the entire short) but I suspect (especially in the case of \"Perfect Day\") maybe they only found the sound discs for the 1929 version, which would have been distributed separately anyway.\n\nThe German sets had more extras, while the UK set has colorized versions of the films. There used to be a website that went into detail about the differences between the various European sets, but I can't seem to find it anymore. However, I did find a similar site that has quite a bit of info, summed up as follows:\n\nMuch more at http://www.inthebalcony.com/shorts/page6.html . Incidentally, they only mention two 10-disc German box sets (which are the two I have), and five separate, additional DVDs, but I could swear that Kinowelt released a third box set comprised of the five individual DVDs plus five additional DVDs of other films."
