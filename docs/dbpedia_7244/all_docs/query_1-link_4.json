        "text": "full name: Harry Eugene Roach\n\nfirst name legally changed to Hal during the 1910s\n\nborn Jan. 14, 1892, in Elmira, NY\n\ndied Nov. 2, 1992, in Bel Air, CA, of pneumonia\n\nThis filmography attempts to include all of the films that Hal Roach worked on, including those not made by his studio. It also attempts to include all of the films made by Hal E. Roach Studios, whether or not Roach himself was involved. The filmography is nearly complete up through the mid 1940s, thanks mostly to Rob Stone, who let me utilize his impressive list, and Richard Lewis Ward, who wrote A History Of The Hal Roach Studios, which includes an extensive filmography. I've also received quite a lot of help from Joe Moore, who has filled in some gaps and provided clarification for some of the information. The list below is the most complete that I've seen so far. It should be noted, however, that the TV era (from the late '40s into the early '60s) is far from complete. For some shows, I've been able to find a list of all the episodes, but not for others. Also, it isn't always clear whether a show was actually made by Roach's company, or simply renting studio space. For the purposes of this filmography, rental situations are not included, other than being briefly mentioned when known.\n\n1913\n\nRoach started as an extra with Universal in early 1913. He frequently appeared in westerns starring J. Warren Kerrigan. It was during this period that he met Harold Lloyd.\n\nRealizing that his acting abilities were limited, Roach began to take various non-acting assignments, and eventually served as assistant director on the Jeanie McPherson series of shorts.\n\nPresumably, Roach didn't limit his options to Universal, and turned up at a number of other studios.\n\nunspecified title (technical advisor/extra role)\n\n1913 - Universal\n\nRoach advised on how the game of roulette was played, so as to make it realistic in the film. He remembered this as his first film.\n\n1914\n\nRoach continued to work as an extra for Universal and other studios, as well as occasional work behind the cameras.\n\nOn July 23rd, Roach formed the Rolin Film Company with partner Dan Linthicum (combining their names to form the company name), and a third partner, I. H. Nance. Roach was elected president of the company. They hired Harold Lloyd to play the lead in the one-reel Willie Work series, with Jane Novak as his leading lady and Roy Stewart as the heavy. They also filmed two-reel dramas, with Stewart in the lead and Lloyd and Novak in support.\n\nOn August 17th, Nance was replaced by Dwight Whiting.\n\nAfter several films had been made in the late summer and early fall, Lloyd defected to Keystone over a pay dispute. Roach briefly tried another comedian, but production ceased when funds ran dry, with the company still lacking a distributor.\n\nRoach then began directing comedies for Essanay, featuring such players as Bud Jamison and Snub Pollard.\n\nThe Squaw Man (presumed bit role)\n\nFeb. 23, 1914 - Lasky - 6 reels\n\nAlso listed as Feb. 15, 1914.

Pathé distributed only one Willie Work short, \"Just Nuts,\" and wanted Rolin to reunite the three principles, but only Harold Lloyd was available. Pathé was able to pick and choose which films they distributed, with Rolin turning over the rest to Motion Picture Specialties Corporation, which found other distribution for a handful of the remaining films.\n\nDuring the summer, the company leased facilities owned by Norbig Film Manufacturing Company at 1745-51 Alessandro Street in Edendale.\n\nLloyd developed the Lonesome Luke character during the course of the year, and was joined in July by Bebe Daniels and Snub Pollard.\n\nDee Lampton joined the Roach stock company late in the year.\n\nIn October, Pathé committed to a long-term contract to distribute the Lonesome Luke series. It should be noted that Pathé released four films in 1915, \"Lonesome Luke\" (June 7), \"Once Every Ten Minutes\" (July 12), \"Soaking The Clothes\" (Aug. 9) and \"Pressing His Suit\" (Aug. 23) that were not made by Rolin Film Company, even though they've been long attributed to the Lonesome Luke series. IMDb corrects this error, but credits Roach as an 'unconfirmed' director.\n\nWillie Runs The Pack aka Willie Runs The Park (producer/director)\n\nJan. 2, 1915 - Rollin/Warner's - 1 reel - prod. #13 - Willie Work series\n\nAlso listed as Feb. 1915.

These comedies initially starred Snub Pollard, but over the years, they included most of the one-reelers made by the company, regardless of the star. Pollard's sidekick in these initial comedies was child actor Ernie \"Sunshine Sammy\" Morrison, who had arrived at the studio shortly before the accident.\n\nOn September 1st, Ernie Morrison was signed to a long-term contract. Correspondence between Roach and Pathé executive Fred Quimby during this period reveals that Roach wanted to start a series of 'coon' pictures, no doubt starring Morrison. The head of Pathé in the US, Paul Brunet, vetoed this idea on the premise that 'kid' series were generally not successful. Roach had to content himself with featuring Morrison in the Pollard series, which was advertised as though the two were a comedy team.\n\nOn September 2nd, tragedy struck again when Dee Lampton, who had previously starred in his own series, died of a ruptured appendix.\n\nIn November, construction began on Hal E. Roach Studios in Culver City. The land was provided for free by Harry Culver, who was trying to attract movie studios to his city. One contemporary publication places the beginning of the Roach studio on November 8th, which may or may not have been the first day of construction.\n\nHarold Lloyd returned to work at the end of the year.\n\nDo You Love Your Wife?

This series was incorporated into the Rolin Comedies.\n\nIn February, production units began to use the new Culver City studio, which hadn't reached its completion date.\n\nIn April, the Beatrice La Plante series ended.\n\nOn April 20th, the Roach studio in Culver City was officially completed.\n\nIn June, a series of one-reelers called Vanity Fair Maids went into production. It quickly became Vanity Fair Girls, and starred Eddie Boland. This series was considered separate from the Rolin Comedies.\n\nThe July 3rd issue of Motion Picture News announced that a \"three cornered deal\" was struck between Roach, Pathé and Associated Exhibitors, Inc., whereby Harold Lloyd would make more than a million and a half dollars during the first year. This deal took effect after Lloyd's final release of 1920.\n\nLloyd's meteoric rise in popularity during this year led to a reissuing of the Lonesome Luke comedies.\n\nOn August 16th, Rolin Film Company was officially renamed Hal E. Roach Studios. With this name-change, the one-reelers produced by the company were renamed the Hal Roach Comedies.\n\nIMDb includes \"Nomads Of The North\" among the films Roach produced during this year, but they simultaneously attribute it to another company, so it's doubtful that Roach was involved.\n\nRed Hot Hottentots (producer/author)\n\nJan. 4, 1920 - Rolin/Pathé - 1 reel - prod.

The author credit is according to the copyright deposit.\n\n1921\n\nIn January of this year, the Vanity Fair Girls were retired, and their series became a solo vehicle called the Eddie Boland Comedies.\n\nIn February, Charles Parrott (later known as Charley Chase) joined Roach to direct the Snub Pollard series.\n\nOn February 28th, Ernie Morrison's contract was renewed.\n\nIn March, Gaylord Lloyd (the brother of Harold), was featured in a handful of the Hal Roach Comedies. These were intially meant to be a revival of the Lonesome Luke comedies, and Lloyd's physical appearance in the films bears this out to some extent.\n\nEarly in the year, the Harold Lloyd series began to be funded by Associated Exhibitors.\n\nOn April 17th, Roach contracted with the Ruth Roland company to make a serial in conjunction with his company.\n\nIn August, the Hal Roach Comedies started to feature Paul Parrott (actually Charles' brother, James), who replaced the departing Eddie Boland. There was also a George Rowe pilot produced for this series the same month.\n\nOn September 20th, Roach signed a contract with Pathé for the release of a Sunshine Sammy two-reeler that failed to achieve series status.\n\nLate in the year, the Ruth Roland serial \"White Eagle\" was produced by her own company in conjunction with Roach.\n\nWith the release of the Harold Lloyd mini-feature \"A Sailor-Made Man,\" his unit switched exclusively to feature production.\n\nIn December, Charles Parrott (aka Chase) was appointed director-general of the studio. This gave him supervisory status over all of the non-Lloyd films.\n\nSpecial note: In his book, Richard Ward lists a one-reeler entitled \"One-Quarter Inch,\" which was part of the Lloyd reissue series and released on September 11th. This was either a retitled film, a previously unreleased film, or a mistake in the source material.\n\nThe Morning After (producer/writer)\n\nJan. 9, 1921 - Roach/Pathé - 1 reel - prod.

The author credit is according to the copyright deposit.\n\n1922\n\nIn January of this year, the first film starring Hal Roach's Rascals was shot and titled \"Our Gang,\" a name that soon became an alternate title for the series.\n\nThe January 14th issue of Motion Picture News reported that Roach was in New York visiting the offices of Pathé, along with Mrs. Roach, Harold Lloyd, Mildred Davis, and Mildred's mother. During this visit, Roach and Pathé signed a new 3-year deal covering all of the Roach product (according to the Feb. 18th issue). They were due to return by February 1st (according to the Jan. 28th issue).\n\nOn January 19th, Roach and Pathé signed into a distribution deal for Hal Roach's Rascals.\n\nOn January 31st, Harold Lloyd signed a new contract with Pathé.\n\nIn March, the Snub Pollard series graduated to 2-reel status, but this turned out to be a bad idea and they soon reverted back to the one-reel format.\n\nA second Ruth Roland serial, entitled \"The Timber Queen,\" was produced this year.\n\nThe April 2nd issue of Motion Picture News announced that Roach had given up producing serials and would concentrate solely on comedies going forward.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Jobyna Ralston replaced Mildred Davis as Harold Lloyd's leading lady.\n\nIt appears that Charles Parrott (aka Chase) resigned as director-general in December to concentrate on acting.\n\nThe Will Rogers films \"The Ropin' Fool\" and \"Fruits Of Faith\" are listed in IMDb as Roach films, but were almost certainly produced elsewhere.\n\nWhite Eagle - chapter 1: The Sign Of The Trident (producer)\n\nJan. 1, 1922 - Roland/Roach/Pathé - 2 reels - prod.
