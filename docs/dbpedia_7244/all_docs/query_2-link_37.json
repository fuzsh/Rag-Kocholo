        "text": "Tim L'Amoureux's recollections of Laurel and Hardy's run-in with a player piano are basically correct. The film was not entitled \"The Piano Movers\" but is in fact called \"The Music Box\". The three-reeler was written and filmed 78 years ago right now, in mid-to-late December of 1931, and released on April 16, 1932. The piano used in the opening of the film may well have been an Ampico upright reproducer, but the piano that Stan and Ollie have just delivered to a hilltop home up an enormous flight of stairs was \"an old broken-down upright... made so it could be chopped to pieces easily,\" according to T. Marvin Hatley. Hatley was the music director at the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California. He provided the music for the piano just out of camera range, playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" which was the first tune of what the piano roll leader calls \"Patriotic Medley\". \"I played with lots of tremolos, like a player piano,\" Hatley said, adding that as actor Billy Gilbert smashed the piano with an axe, he watched Gilbert's actions \"trying to catch all of his axe hits.\" The piano demonstrated at the beginning of the film was playing \"The King's Horses (and the King's Men),\" and may well have been an actual piano roll rather than Hatley playing. The Academy Award-nominated composer Hatley wrote Laurel and Hardy's theme song, \"The Cuckoo Song\" (often called \"Ku Ku\"), and was a musician who could play any instrument, \"except the harp,\" he told me in 1979. The breakaway piano was rigged by Roach prop man Thomas Benton Roberts, who told me in 1986 that an actual piano was in the shipping case that the boys carry up the stairs, \"to give it weight and authenticity, that the boys were actually working with a heavy object.\" I doubt his memory a bit as at one point in the action, the shipment ends up in a large fountain and the case floats. \"Professor Theodore von Schwarzenhoffen, MD, AD, DDS, FLD, FFF und F\", played by Billy Gilbert, is the reluctant recipient of Laurel and Hardy's delivery. They have managed to wreck half of his house in their duties, and as they clean up their mess, they start the piano, performing a dance of sorts as they retrieve debris from the von Schwarzenhoffen living room. When the homeowner arrives, he proclaims his disdain for pianos (\"I hate and detest pianos, they are mechanical blunderbusses!\"), and he chops the instrument into kindling. When Billy Gilbert tears the front off the instrument, it is obvious that the spool box is merely a box affixed to the front. There is no air motor or pneumatic stack in evidence. There are real piano action parts inside -- hammers and piano wire, etc. -- but the entire instrument is reduced to a shambles in very short order. When the patriotic medley goes into \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" Stan and Ollie face forward and salute. Professor von Schwarzenhoffen momentarily ceases his hacking as he does likewise. He snaps out of his temporary calm and shuts the roll off, resuming his destruction. The film concludes when Mrs. von Schwarzenhoffen arrives and informs her husband that she bought the piano to surprise him on his birthday! He apologizes profusely to Stan and Ollie, asking \"What can I do to show you how sorry I am?\" Ollie asks for his signature on the bill of lading, snapping his fingers to gain his partner's attention and saying, \"Stanley, the pen.\" Gilbert opens the pen only to prove the writing implement is certainly a fountain pen as it sprays its ink directly in his face as the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company make a hasty exit. On November 18, 1932, \"The Music Box\" won the Academy Award for \"Best Short Subject (Comedy)\" of 1931-32. The monumental flight of stairs used in the film is a public alley way between 923 and 937 Vendome Street (at Del Monte) in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, and the stairs appear now very much as they did in 1931, although a hand rail and street lights have been added. Neighboring homes are virtually identical to their 1931 appearance! Incidentally, there are 131 steps in the stairway. The stairs were used by the Hal Roach Studios in other films, including 1925's \"Isn't Life Terrible?\", a Charley Chase silent film which co-starred Oliver Hardy, and again in July of 1927 in \"Hats Off\", a lost Laurel and Hardy silent comedy wherein the boys are door-to-door washing machine salesmen who climb the steps repeatedly carrying the heavy appliance. \"Hats Off\", the 'Holy Grail' of lost comedy films, was reworked into \"The Music Box\" four years later for what is now considered one of Laurel and Hardy's best comedies in their 106-film partnership. \"The Music Box\" is not the only film where Laurel and Hardy have an encounter with automatic music. Among the numerous \"musical\" comedies are the following: In \"Night Owls\" (1930), newly-recruited cat burglars Stan and Ollie accidentally start a reproducing grand piano that bursts into a spirited, up-tempo rendition of \"Under the Anheiser Busch\" as the boys stuff cushions and whatnot under the lid to muffle the commotion! A coin-operated piano is seen and heard in \"The Live Ghost\" (1934), and an organ grinder (with a gorilla instead of a monkey!) plays for donations in the feature \"Swiss Miss\" (1938). Non-automatic musical interludes in Laurel and Hardy films include \"Beau Hunks\" (1931) when Oliver plays a baby upright piano which is soon reduced to scrap when he falls on the instrument; \"Dirty Work\" (1933) when chimney sweeps Laurel and Hardy smash the broom extensions into an upright piano; in \"Way Out West\" (1937) Stan and Ollie hide inside a grand piano to evade the villain (mustachioed, squint-eyed James Finlayson), who slams the lid on the boys, breaking the bottom out of the instrument. \"Below Zero\" (1930) finds Stan playing \"In the Good Old Summertime\" on a portable melodeon accompanied by Ollie on string bass. It's snowing in the dead of winter! Both instruments are soon flattened; the silent short \"Wrong Again\" (1929) finds Laurel and Hardy returning the stolen \"Blue Boy\" to its owner, who tells them to put \"him\" on top of the piano -- he always keeps him there! The owner was expecting the Gainsborough painting, but stable hands Laurel and Hardy were returning a same-named race horse, which they eventually do manage to get atop a grand piano! Stan and Ollie's epic battle delivering a player piano in \"The Music Box\" inspired an event at the 6th International Convention of the Sons of the Desert which our local Laurel and Hardy club and I hosted in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1988. Contacting a piano tuner friend of mine, I obtained five old upright pianos which we intended to smash to smithereens in our \"Professor Theodore von Schwarzenhoffen, MD, AD, DDS, FLD, FFF und F 'I Hate and Detest Pianos' Piano Demolition.\" The tuner assured me that the instruments were beyond repair. In a public park overlooking the Mississippi River and across the street from our convention hotel, a pair of L&H look-alikes moved one piano into position as I played the irate professor. As local television cameras rolled, I single-handedly reduced an upright piano to a fairly flat pile of kindling using a sledge hammer. Then it was the conventioneers' turn. The four remaining pianos were systematically bashed into oblivion, with each participant getting three whacks at the instruments. One piano actually looked pretty nice and a talented conventioneer played ragtime on it until it was the last piano standing. This particular piano seemed to defy the assault and refused to fall. After considerable bashing, the instrument finally met the same fate as its predecessors. All this action took place July 15, 1988, during a heat wave that sent the day's temperature to 103 degrees F (with a 114 degree heat index!). Laurel and Hardy buffs retrieved pieces of the pianos as souvenirs of their part of the event. (Participants received a \"Certificate of Musical Depreciation\" signed by Professor von Schwarzenhoffen.) The only drawback to the occasion was that the refuse company we had hired to bring a dumpster to the site for the disposal of the remains neglected to open the end of the receptacle. Our clean up crew had to hoist the heavy sounding board and harp assemblies over the five-foot high sides of the dumpster in that searing heat! Besides having a great interest in automatic musical instruments, I am the \"Grand Sheik\" (president) of the Twin Cities Block-Heads tent of the Sons of the Desert, the international Laurel and Hardy club.
