Cheeseman, 14, of Nashville passed away Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2006 at Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor, after a courageous battle with aplastic anemia. Andrew was born in Hastings on Dec. 26, 1991, the son of Kevin Cheeseman and Miriam Schantz (Raines).\n\nAndrew was raised in the Nashville area and attended Maple Valley Schools, where he was currently in the 8th grade. One of Andrew's favorite school activities was playing in the youth hockey league at Maple Valley, which he participated in from 4th through 6th grade.\n\nAt a very young age, Andrew developed a love for spending time on Grandpa Schantz's dairy farm. It was not uncommon for Andrew to pass up a night out for dinner just to hang out on the farm. At the age of 9, Andrew began to explore his love of animals and farming by joining 4-H. Over the years he has participated by raising and showing rabbits, goats, and his true love, dairy cows. His desire to be involved in farming didn't stop at Grandpa's farm; when visiting the local stockyards in Battle Creek and Lake Odessa, Andrew would jump right in and begin lending a hand, and over the years became very skilled.\n\nAndrew was also captivated by the large semi trucks his father drove. When asked, \"What would you like to be when you grow up?\" Andrew's quick wit and perfect knack for logic led him to the perfect career: Driving a cattle truck, of course. After all, it was the best of both worlds  driving big trucks with cattle inside; what could be better?\n\nSpending much of his spare time on the farm, Andrew developed a passion for exploring nature. Andrew loved to spend time outdoors whenever possible. He enjoyed deer hunting and was especially looking forward to his first firearm deer season and his second full season bow hunting. During the summer months, he loved to spend time fishing and especially enjoyed his fishing trips with his dad.\n\nAndrew's interests extended well beyond farming and spending time outdoors. He was also an avid University of Michigan fan, and enjoyed playing football. Recently Andrew began to study karate and was working through his various belts, most recently achieving the level of Purple Belt.\n\nThrough a close family friend, Andrew was introduced to the game of golf. Within a very short period of time, the family's back yard was expanded by changing fence lines and making their pasture smaller to create a perfect place to practice his newfound sporting passion. Andrew truly enjoyed keeping his practice course mowed, which he did twice per week. He took great joy in making fancy designs with the lawn mower before hitting golf balls. Andrew especially loved to play a round of golf with his mom at Twin Brook Golf Course in Charlotte, and often began their conversations with a smiling, \"Well, how'd you do?\"\n\nAndrew also enjoyed riding his dirt bike up and down Grandpa's lanes. The entire family got involved and helped make trails through the woods and hayfields and down the lane so Andrew could get anywhere on his bike or quad.\n\nWhen Andrew could not be outside, he enjoyed watching college football, NASCAR (Go Dale Earnhardt Jr.), Michigan Outdoors and golf. He also loved a good movie; he especially enjoyed the entire Star Wars series, the Harry Potter Collection, the \"Fast and the Furious\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" The Lord of the Rings series was a favorite, which he would always watch with Grandma Cheeseman.\n\nIt was Andrew's passion for adventure and his go-anywhere, try-anything attitude that allowed Andrew to expand his horizons well beyond Barry County. With his Grandma and Grandpa Cheeseman as companions, Andrew's love of travel took him from one side of the United States to the other, and even into Canada. It was during many of these adventures that Andrew fostered an appreciation for theater. In his travels he has attended the theatrical performances of some the most acclaimed shows such as \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Phantom of the Opera,\" \"The Lion King,\" \"Chicago\" and several others.\n\nAndrew embodied the all-American boy, and was truly a friend's friend. It didn't matter to Andrew where you grew up, what type of clothes you wore or what crowd you hung out with. It was his ability to look beyond the outside and befriend the inside that has endeared him to everyone he called his friend.\n\nAndrew is survived by his father, Kevin Cheeseman; his mother and step father, Miriam and Todd Raines; step brother, Jordon Raines; beloved grandparents, Homer Schantz, Carol and Elmer Cheeseman and Christy Newland; aunts and uncles, Michael (Rexanne) Cheeseman, Rachelle (David) Gorton, Levi (Tara) Schantz, Michael Schantz and Austin Schantz; his cousins, Jessica, Jessa, Katie and Michaela Cheeseman, Gabe and Ben Gorton and Adam and Dillon Schantz.\n\nFuneral services were held at the Nashville Baptist Church Monday, Oct. 16 with Pastor Karl Strenge officiating.
