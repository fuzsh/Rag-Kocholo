        "text": "Characteristics:\n\n-Attitude\n\n-Rebel\n\n-Passion\n\n-Aggression\n\n-Energy\n\n-Proving a point/rebelling\n\nPolitics/Riots (Punk Rock began riots with politics etc due to its aggressive and political lyrics. In a way in my opinion I think Punk helped people within society speak their minds. Encouraging people to rebel)\n\nInstrumentation:\n\n-Vocals\n\n-Drums\n\n-Guitar\n\n-Bass\n\nKey Artists:\n\n–Sex Pistols\n\n-Ramones\n\n-The Clash\n\n-The Buzzcocks\n\nPlaces of origin:\n\n–UK\n\nIn my own opinion I think Punk originated and was more influenced by Sex Pistols. Yes they weren’t the first punk band, but they were the punk band which made the genre more recognisable and got people to rebel. Punk is aggressive genre which has a lot of passion.\n\nSex Pistols\n\nRamones\n\nThe Buzzcocks\n\nThe Clash\n\nMusic clips for sound collage\n\nOne of the Sex Pistols songs I want to use is called Bodies, which is in their album ‘Never mind the Buzzcocks’. Annoyingly I can’t find it on Youtube. I have the audio due to having the album, but couldn’t upload it on to Soundcloud due to copyright. Therefore into google I researched ‘sex pistols bodies mp3 online’ and found a site called ‘musicmp3’ where they have all the sex pistols songs.\n\nAbout My Composition/Mashup\n\nThese audio tracks were used in my punk composition mashup. This was my 3rd attempt of making a compisition, as when we had first started this task I found it very difficult. I originially wanted to make a composition of new wave/post punk songs, but when the task was assigned we did get mislead and think we had to make an actual mashup. So for that I got the songs, Joy Division ‘love will tear us apart’, Cocteau twins- pearly dew drops drop & martha & the muffins- Echo Beach. I got an instrumnetal of love will tear us a part and was gonna do a sort of mashup/remix of it and martha & the muffins. It was very difficult and just didn’t go together. Another mashup I done was of alternative rock, which is another main genre I love. Songs I put in the composition were ‘Radiohead- Nude’, PJ Harvey- The Devil, Soundgarden-Pretty Noose, Soma- Smashing Pumpkins. It was my first attempt of a composition, but it still wasn’t right. Also the genres weren’t all the same, as I guess Soundgarden is more grunge than alt rock.\n\nFor my actual composotion I chose Punk Rock, a genre I am quite knowelgeable of.\n\nThe songs I used in it were, Sex Pistols- Bodies, Ramones, The Clash- Police & Thieves, Bikini Kill- Rebel Girl, The Stooges- I wanna be your dog, The Undertones- Teenage Kicks, Buzzcocks-Bordeom, The Runaways-Cherry Bomb, Slaves-Debbie Where’s Your Car?\n\nBibliography\n\nJoel Gustafsson.
