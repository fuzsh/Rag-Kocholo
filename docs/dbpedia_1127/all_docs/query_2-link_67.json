        "text": "Teenage Kicks.\n\nTeenage Kicks\n\nBrighton\n\nWe are Teenage Kicks. A 3-piece party function band based in Brighton and available to hire for your events UK wide! We've got years of experience playing gigs all over the world, from tiny clubs to massive venues. We're a 3-piece band, but because we have keyboards and we all sing backing vocals, we're able to sound like a much bigger band. We perform a huge variety of musical styles from rock and roll classics by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks and Otis Redding to modern indie and pop hits by artists as diverse as Kings Of Leon, Arctic Monkeys, Muse, Oasis, Blur, The Killers and Kasabian to Amy Winehouse, Bruno Mars, Take That, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. We have a genuine love of classic rock and roll but we also thrive on recreating the festival vibes of bands like Kings of Leon, The Foo Fighters and The Killers. We've been living and breathing music for the past 15 years and have been entertaining audiences at private events across the length and breadth of the UK since 2010. Not only have we performed for a number of prestigious corporate clients (ING Insurance, RAF Benson, medical research charity Action for A-T) but we have also taken to the stage at some of the UK's top private event venues such as Stanmer House, Brighton, RAF Benson, The Walled Garden, Cowdray, Blackstock Farm, Hellingly, Walton Castle, Somerset, East Quay Resturant, Whitstable Harbour. Lastest Music Bar, Brighton, Little Ship Club, London.\n\nTeenage Kicks.âs tracks\n\nDo I Wanna Know? - Arctic Monkeys by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-09-30T21:53:48Z\n\nHappy - Pharrell Williams by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-09-23T22:01:43Z\n\nRock The Casbah - The Clash by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-09-23T22:01:41Z\n\nThis Charming Man - The Smiths by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-09-23T22:01:38Z\n\nSuspicious Minds - Elvis Presley by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:14:34Z\n\nTeenage Kicks - The Undertones by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:09:29Z\n\nMessage In A Bottle - The Police by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:09:07Z\n\nGo Your Own Way - Fleetwood Mac by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:09:00Z\n\nGet Lucky - Daft Punk by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:08:52Z\n\nDon't Look Back Into The Sun - The Libertines by Teenage Kicks.\n\npublished on 2014-01-29T11:08:44Z"
