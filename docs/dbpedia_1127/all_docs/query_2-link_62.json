        "text": "Was being a teen in the 1960s really all miniskirts and pop music?\n\nTeenage Kicks challenges the stereotypes around growing up in the 60s and 70s through the stories of eight women, now in their 70s and 80s, who were teenagers between 1956 and 1974. This eye-opening exhibition spotlights Andrea’s personal story.\n\nGrowing up in a small Gloucestershire village, Andrea’s formative years revolved around church and her youth club and, though academically gifted, she faced bullying for not conforming to makeup and boy-crazed norms.\n\nHer scholastic achievements earned her the rare opportunity to attend university in London and there she blossomed – exploring student activism and her sexuality in an era of significant social change.\n\nBased on University of Manchester research interviews, Andrea’s compelling narrative provides a candid window into the nuanced realities of 1960s teenagers – life beyond the stereotypes.\n\nWhether you lived it or not, her story is sure to resonate."
