        "text": "Nothing will ever touch the unique energy of 1970s punk rock music. Bands like Sex Pistols, The Ramones, and New York Dolls dominated the genre and delivered some pretty memorable hits. But even those trailblazers of punk have a few underrated songs from the 1970s that fans should appreciate. Let’s dive into six different songs every good-for-nothing punk should at least hear once!\n\n1. “Neat Neat Neat” by The Damned\n\nThis underrated punk song from the 1970s was released ahead of The Damned’s debut 1977 album Damned Damned Damned. It’s a punk rock classic, complete with high-energy guitar, speeding drums, and notably sharp vocals. The song captures the uniquely rebellious vibe of early punk music quite beautifully.\n\n2. “Blitzkrieg Bop” by The Ramones\n\nAny lover of classic punk music worth their salt has likely heard “Blitzkrieg Bop” by The Ramones, but we’d argue it’s still kind of underrated. It’s a legendary 1976 song that kicked off the band’s debut self-titled album. It’s been used for movie soundtracks and commercials alike, but the song deserves a little more respect for how iconic it was at the time of its release.\n\n3. “Anarchy In The UK” by Sex Pistols\n\nThis 1976 song by Sex Pistols is one of the most influential songs of the British punk rock movement. Still, some listeners across the pond may not be familiar with it. It’s a politically critical song about anarchism and personal freedom, complete with the Pistols’ notably aggressive sound.\n\n4. “Personality Crisis” by New York Dolls\n\nOne of the greatest American punk bands of all time, New York Dolls released quite a few addictive punk tracks during their heyday. “Personality Crisis” is one of the best off of the band’s debut 1973 album. It’s a catchier, more melodic example of punk rock at its finest.\n\n5. “Sonic Reducer” by The Dead Boys\n\n“Sonic Reducer” is featured on The Dead Boys’ 1977 album Young, Loud and Snotty. It’s an anthemic punk rock treat that has since been covered by everyone from Guns N’ Roses to Pearl Jam to Bad Religion.\n\n[Get Tickets To See The Dead Boys Live On Tour In 2024]\n\n6. “Teenage Kicks” by The Undertones\n\nThe Undertones are pretty underrated when it comes to punk rock bands of the 1970s. Their 1978 track “Teenage Kicks” is a catchy delight. It’s quite a bright, vibrant song that contrasts a bit with the darker tunes penned by The Undertones’ contemporaries. The whole of their debut self-titled album is essential listening.\n\nPhoto by Michael Ochs Archives\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission."
