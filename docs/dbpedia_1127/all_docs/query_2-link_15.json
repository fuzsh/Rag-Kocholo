        "text": "A big weekend ahead at Target Field! Green Day, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Rancid on Saturday, and Def Leppard and Journey on Monday! Plus the anniversary of the recording of one of the most iconic music videos of all time.\n\nThis week on Teenage Kicks, we’re keeping it simple and keeping it fun! We will be playing 26 songs from 26 artists, in alphabetical order.\n\nThis Saturday is the 45th anniversary of Talking Heads’ Fear of Music – there is a fan theory that many of the song titles can be prefaced by “Fear Of” – e.g. Fear of Cities, Fear of Air, Fear of Animals, making it literal “Fear Of” music – although as Steve Seel once said, “so where does that leave I Zimbra??”\n\nA massive day in music history, as Saturday marks the 40th anniversary of the film Purple Rain, the 51st anniversary of New York Dolls’ debut album, birthdays including Juliana Hatfield, the late Karl Mueller of Soul Asylum, Rex Brown of Pantera, plus history highlights that will include the first time ever that John Denver and Metallica will be played side-by-side on The Current.\n\nThis week on Teenage Kicks, we’ll be listening to artists that participated in Live Aid on July 13, 1985. Live Aid was a music-based fundraising initiative to raise funds for relief of the famine in Ethiopia.\n\nThis week on Teenage Kicks, we will be highlighting the anniversaries of Joy Division and Nirvana debuts, coincidentally released exactly 10 years apart. We will also be talking about a handful of upcoming shows, including Pixies, and check out some songs that have been covered by Iron & Wine ahead of his show at the Palace Theater on Saturday night."
