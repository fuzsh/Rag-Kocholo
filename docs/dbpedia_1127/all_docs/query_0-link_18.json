        "text": "If you came to power pop through the punk rock door, as I did, distinctions between the two genres can get a little blurry. I’m sure I heard power-pop first—mostly thanks to the radio—but I didn’t really encounter the term until well after discovering punk.\n\nBy that point, I was exploring bands like Ramones, the Clash, Generation X, the Replacements, Buzzcocks, Hüsker Dü, and the Damned. Closer to home, I was drawn to SoCal bands like X, the Dickies, Redd Kross, Social Distortion, Agent Orange, and Descendents.\n\nAll of those bands were undoubtedly punk rock, especially early on in their careers, but looking back it’s obvious I liked my punk energy with a dose of hooks. The pop thrills weren’t pronounced in every one of their songs, just consistent enough to sweeten the aggressive onslaught."
