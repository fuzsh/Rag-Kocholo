        "text": "The Balboas The Pandemic Singles LP\n\nHorror-themed surf punk from Ohio that delivers dueling reverbed VENTURES-style guitars over ten songs with some notable guests like East Bay Ray, surf icon Dave Wronski, and fucking Dez Cadena (more on him in a second). The accomplished musicianship is impressive, especially on the instrumental tracks. Inventive leads intertwine through propulsive bass and drums, and although very polished, they sound gritty, inspired, and fun. The band has a very specific time-capsule niche—maybe like 1995? We have press photos of the members dressed in Tarantino-esque black suits and shades, kitschy references to Planet of the Apes, Don Ho, and Pat Boone, and that godawful cover art that recalls mid-’90s melodic hardcore. The vocal tracks adhere to this shtick and ruin the rest of the record for me. The spoken/sung lyrics come off as smarmy and goofy coffee shop poetry. Take “Karrot Water Mind Control”: “I have a scratch in my skull that never heals / I got an itch in my head I only scratch from inside / Your solution is toxic and caustic pollution,” delivered in a kind of condescending sing-song. I cringed a little hearing it. Even worse is the cover of BIG BLACK’s “Bad Penny.” Without the dripping menace of Steve Albini’s vocal approach, it comes across as a novelty cover, which is risky when you’re messing with one of punk’s sacred texts. Now back to Dez—when I saw his name, I assumed the track would highlight his broken-glass-gargling rasp, one of the most incredible voices in hardcore history, arguably the best singer of BLACK FLAG. Nope, he doesn’t sing. I guess he’s playing guitar somewhere in the background. WTF?\n\nReviewer Nick Odorizzi\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nBöset Sista Varningen LP\n\nSwedish mangel from the same town as legendary D-beaters SKITSYSTEM and SHITLICKERS (something must be in the water)—BÖSET carries on the tradition of fast and loud raw punk on their new LP Sista Varningen, with twelve politically-charged heaters that will leave fans of the genre with little to be desired. Opening track “Rasera Deras Borg” is a strong start, showcasing the band’s ability to touch on every hallmark of this style, including a nice shift into rock’n’roll at the one-and-a-half-minute mark, a move I’m always a sucker for. Throughout the album BÖSET does a nice job keeping things from getting stale, like on the ripped-from-’82 “Vi är Långt Förbi Sista Varningen” and the neat spoken word breakdown on “E Ni Goa i Hövvet Eller?” Lyrically, the band is pissed about shitty jobs (“Avskaffa Arbetslinjen”) and not buying into excessive consumerism (“Krossa Konsumismen”) amongst other things, and while I don’t speak or understand the language, I can pick up what they’re putting down. Overall, a solid album that keeps Gothenburg’s impressive track record intact.\n\nReviewer Eric Anderson\n\nLabel Flyktsoda\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nFlower Hell of the Next / Physical God 7″\n\nFLOWER is old school. They walk the walk, and it feels good to have a band that values the proper anarcho-punk lifestyle and politics over Instagramability. Speaking of which, we should all be grateful no one has come up with a crust filter yet. That would just be the official end of punk. The first album of these New Yorkers, Hardly a Dream, took our microcosm by surprise and by storm. Was a band ever quite as bombarded with NAUSEA comparisons? Probably not, but then there are much worse bands to be compared to. Anticipation and expectations were quite high regarding the follow-up and, where most bands would have gone for a cleaner, rounder sound, which would be a logical step, a conventional progression, FLOWER decided to go crustier and rawer. That’s probably a poor career choice, but one that I salute solemnly. The basis of the music remains the same, rooted in dirty, old school metallic crust with Danny’s half-shouted, half-spoken vocals conveying a serious anarcho-punk vibe—I am reminded of NAUSEA obviously, and of ’90s crusty anarcho bands like RESIST AND EXIST or HOMOMILITIA at times, at least in terms of intent—giving FLOWER an original edge and emphasizing the political nature of their lyrics, which you can actually understand (you won’t need a Grizzli dictionary here). Musically, this is pretty much heaven for me, if angels wore crust pants. The late ANTISECT influence prevails here, and FLOWER manages to recreate that primitive, dark metal punk vibe with ease. The production is raw but still highlights the interplay of the instruments, and the music is not lacking in aggression. There is a cracking atmospheric introduction on “Physical God,” top chugging riffs, and some creepy bass lines that make me think that early EXTINCTION OF MANKIND, SKAVEN, and weed must have been involved in the creative process. The 7” has one long crust song on each side, rather traditionally, and comes in an impressive foldout cover (drawn by guitar hero Willow) displaying in great details a nightmarish and demented (post)modern war-obsessed dystopia, full of dark symbolism befitting a tortured and abused world. Both the music and the visuals complement one another, expand the meaning and contribute to telling a great punk story. A very strong and cohesive single.\n\nReviewer Romain Basset\n\nLabel Fight For Your Mind / Peace of Mind\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nGuiding Light Guiding Light cassette\n\nFirst recorded outing from this new group of Austin punk provocateurs, with five tracks whipping by in a flurry of jangly hyper-strummed guitar (bordering on early WEDDING PRESENT velocity), incessantly bobbing bass, breakneck drumming, and mile-a-minute bilingual German/English femme vocals—it’s the dream world collision of BIG FLAME and HANS-A-PLAST that I never knew that I needed! I’m especially partial to ”Lost in Voices,” which careens for a minute-and-a-half like KLEENEX if they’d existed in the age of Lumpy Records, so restless and wired that it’s almost easy to overlook how intricate and complex the songwriting truly is, as well as the dusty lo-fi tumble of “Spiegelbild,” where GUIDING LIGHT ties knots in the loose threads left hanging by the two-headed dog of 2010s Lone Star art-damage excellence (VIVIENNE STYG/BLUE DOLPHIN) with the addition of some highly Neue Deutsche Welle-inspired off-kilter melodies and warbling synth. Get on it, mess(thetics) with Texas.\n\nReviewer Erika Elizabeth\n\nLabel Down South\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nHall Last Days of Youth LP\n\nGothic, dark garage rock by a three-piece from Berlin. Hall sounds as if BAUHAUS and the ORWELLS had a baby; they utilize a variety of tempos, mostly midrange, in combination with haunting vocals. The instrumentals didn’t “wow” me, as they mostly seemed to be in support of the vocals rather than standing on their own, and some of the songs seemed a bit repetitive in terms of melody. However, the songs overall are all very catchy and slightly off-putting, in a great way. The standout track on this album to me is “Last Days of Youth,” as it has a stronger presence than some of the other songs and delves into a slightly heavier vibe.\n\nReviewer Emma Miller\n\nLabel Alien Snatch\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nNeutrals New Town Dream LP\n\nNEUTRALS follow up their awesome 2022 EP Bus Stop Nights with their second full-length, New Town Dream. Picking up right where that EP left off, we’re treated to thirteen tracks filled to the brim with wonderful pop tunes in the lineage of TELEVISION PERSONALITIES, classic-era Sarah Records, and early Creation Records. All that is to say, an absolute no-brainer for the mighty Slumberland Records to have put out in the US. Throughout the record, there is plenty of variety to keep your ears tuned in and the volume set high. Tracks like “Travel Agent’s Windows” and “Substitute Teacher” detail the humdrum lives of these new town inhabitants so clearly that the mundane transcends to humor—“He was a triumph in the Scottish play / He’s only here for a day.” These details throughout the album make for a truly satisfying listen that will have you returning to check in on the new town’s population again and again.\n\nReviewer D. Gregory\n\nLabel Slumberland / Static Shock\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nPoison Idea Feel the Darkness 2xLP reissue\n\nPOISON IDEA from Portland, Oregon are the kings of punk, and this is what many consider to be their best album. This is an all-time classic record, and when you add in that the sound on this reissue is bigger and fuller-sounding, you can’t go wrong buying this! You can hear POISON IDEA’s influence in bands like LONG KNIFE and SPAZM 151, just to name a couple that wear their POISON IDEA influence on their sleeves. The truth is that they influenced too many bands to name. POISON IDEA is equally at home playing a fast hardcore song or adding some steamroller rock to their sound. One of the best guitar sounds I have ever heard. The bonus LP includes remixes, alternate mixes, original mixes, and 7″ tracks, and it comes in a really nice gatefold jacket. This is an amazing record by an amazing band.\n\nReviewer Bill Chamberlain\n\nLabel American Leather / TKO\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nRotura Al Otro Lado LP\n\nThe Oi! label is predisposed to a certain musical monotony, despite being formed against the status quo, which infects this LP. While melodic and political, each song on Al Otro Lado is punctuated by nothing, it all sounds the same. Listen to “Al Otro Lado,” followed by “Nadie Escucha” to understand my point. Spain-based ROTURA is idyllic in theory, with fast-paced instrumental pop energy and a powerful vocalist, Silvia, yet they fall flat in practice. The frenetic drums were enjoyable on most tracks, but it’s hard to appreciate them between the guitar’s almost-buzzing quality and the one-note vocals. I applaud the album’s production and creativity and perhaps others will enjoy it, but Al Otro Lado, translating “to the other side,” may just have to stay on that side.\n\nReviewer Fiona Rae\n\nLabel A-Z / Discos Enfermos / Distribuidora Soroll / El Lokal / Exabrupto / Gritaomuere / Kink / Nunchakupunk / Vapaa Paiva\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nTeen Cobra Buzzkill LP\n\nThis is right up my alley. It’s a husband-and-wife rock’n’roll duo on a budget, with crunchy guitars and primal drums. This formula can become one-note very quickly, but they’re able to switch up the pace very nicely, like the slow stomp of the intro to “Closer (Satan’s Watching)” and the upbeat chorus of “I Don’t Wanna Walk Alone.” I love the female backing vocals, they almost remind me of BEAT HAPPENING and they add a lot to the music. I don’t think the LP would be what it is without them, because it would be harder to ignore the fact that the singer sounds a lot like KING KHAN. They don’t reinvent the wheel, but this group is very good at taking the limited skills they have musically and just playing with as much energy as possible. Good LP, but I bet they sound even better live.\n\nReviewer Neal Ray\n\nLabel Big Neck\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nThe Vamps Used to Be Cool LP\n\nA glaring omission in typical proto-punk conversations, the VAMPS began penning their original jams in the early ’70s and are regarded by some as “the first punk band from San Antonio, Texas.” Playing a soulful take on ’60s garage, classic R&B, and looser rock’n’roll acts of the era, the band’s music was adept but delivered with a marked irreverence for critical expectations. These early-to-the-game dudes left us with the eight smooth tracks on this archival LP collecting their four 7” releases. Fusing smoky blues (“I Need Somebody”) and CHUCK BERRY-style piano jump (“Nowhere to Go”) into their world-weary and organic rock stylings, they forged a compelling sound that has aged particularly well. Whether intentional or not, singer Frank Pugliese’s vocal intonation is strikingly Johanasen-ian, making the NEW YORK DOLLS one of the group’s most apt comparisons, though the STOOGES influence is also particularly obvious. Cementing their relevance in the history of the burgeoning punk movement, they landed a gig as the sole opener at one of the SEX PISTOLS few US gigs at San Antonio’s Randy’s Rodeo venue in 1978—the stuff of legends. Standout songs on this comprehensive compilation include the wildly catchy title track (whose sentiments are all-too-relatable for myself and most others who would be interested in this record) and the scathing cool of “What’s Your Excuse,” but every tune here is solid, and I can safely deem this an excellent and essential slab for fans of the oldies.\n\nReviewer Jason Harding\n\nLabel Midnight Cruiser\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nV/A All Hell Breaks Loose: A Tribute to the Misfits LP\n\nThis record raises the age-old question: do we really need another MISFITS tribute comp? Does that band, who long ago moved from cult favorite to Hot Topic mainstay, truly warrant more attention? I mean, we’re talking about a band whose “crimson ghost” shirt became so ubiquitous by 2010 that it threatened to undercut the value of the North American Punk Point. Well, whatever your view, it exists, so let’s deal. A lot of these songs play it straight, so if you enjoy a loving rendition of a popular standard, you will find it here. There’s an acoustic take on “Some Kind of Hate,” which will remind you, as if you needed it, just what a remarkable ear for melody these guys had. There are also some truly head-turning interpretations by the LOST LOVES and ST. DIGUE which I will not soon forget. So, like it or not, the MISFITS and their legacy will continue to lurch through the subculture like the living dead.\n\nReviewer Dov Malzberg\n\nLabel Elektriske Plader / Midnat\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\n(+39) 375-649-94-64 My Telephone Number Demo #01 cassette\n\nLo-fi, garage-infused pop duo from Brescia, Italy, a self-described “hardcore techno” band. To me, the cassette is half anthemic garage punk bops and half mid-tempo dancy art-punk. However you choose to categorize them, (+39) 375-649-94-64 MY TELEPHONE NUMBER is sure to become a household name. That is, if it can be figured out exactly what the band name is. I have seen it listed by the Italian label that released it locally, Pollice Di Fuoco, as being (+39) 375-649-94-64, the release by US label Knuckles On Stun lists the band as simply MY TELEPHONE NUMBER, and the band’s official Bandcamp page has it listed as the combination of the two. Confuse me all you want, Wilson and Dany, just keep putting out these wacky, zany, catchy punk tunes!\n\nReviewer Biff Bifaro\n\nLabel Knuckles on Stun / Pollice Di Fuoco\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nBuio Omega I Wanna Crash My Car (On Purpose) / Highway Star cassette\n\nThis is some rockin’ hardcore here out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. My first thought was a slightly more punk version of ANNIHILATION TIME. The first song gives me that vibe, along with reminding me of SCREAMER from England. When the second and final song came on, I was surprised since it is a cover of DEEP PURPLE’s “Highway Star.” I figured there was no way this band was going to be able to pull off that guitar solo, but they really did a fine job; I was legitimately excited by how well they did it. Nice job! Two songs, they are both fun to listen to and I can’t wait to hear more.\n\nReviewer Bill Chamberlain\n\nLabel Bellicose\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nClickbait At Your Leisure LP\n\nAt Your Leisure is the debut record from Chicago’s CLICKBAIT, a self-contained minimal DIY disco dance party to heat up even the chilliest Midwestern basement. These thirteen songs are all unwavering testaments to rhythm, propelled by roundabout, ESG-descended bass lines and four-on-the-floor, hi-hat-rattling beats, with sparse shocks of single-note guitar dropping in judiciously alongside equally concise lyrical missives from vocalist Sandra, whose matter-of-fact deadpan delivery periodically slips into more animated shrieks. The neo-no-wave needling of “Audacity” leaves plenty of negative space for posing rhetorical questions (“What do I want? / Do I need it?”), while the GAUCHE-like “So-So” digs deep into a perpetual motion groove as Sandra’s coolly detached speak-sing gets increasingly intense, ultimately breaking into a pointed, impassioned wail (“Being a woman is not a competition / That I want to play in”). The dry, frills-free recording imparts the LP with a certain out-of-time feeling, like listening to a years-weathered cassette capture of a clandestine PYLON rehearsal in the studio art building of a state college circa 1980—there’s a scribbled precariousness and sense of spontaneity in CLICKBAIT’s wound-up sound that’s particularly refreshing in a modern world of BODEGAs and GUSTAFs sanitizing this sort of funky art-punk for IPA-drinkers at gentrifying rock clubs; bless them for that.\n\nReviewer Erika Elizabeth\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nDeef Real Control LP\n\nReal Control is DEEF’s second individual release, originally put out on tape in 1984. They started as teenagers, a time when within a short period, significant changes can happen within your taste of music. Luckily, they did not approach songwriting drastically differently. It is still aggressive, exciting punk, in its most raw and primitive way without being overly noisy or filthy. Again, it’s speed that introduces most of the vehemence, but intensity is present in slower jams such as “We Kill All Punk Rock Heroes.” The same info sheet that is included for the Nou reissue is also present here, mentioning DEEF’s isolation. Sonically, this makes them rootless in the sense that it’s so visceral that sometimes it sounds as if they have only read about hardcore punk and tried to reproduce it from imagination, not that it is so out-of-place or sort of avant garde, and it’s rarely reusing lifted gimmicks from other classic records. This is why these reissues are relevant and still sound fresh, because the music on them, even if heard many times, remains new because teenagers made it without having a clue or caring too much about whatever things current bands consider when playing music. The bass sound is more meaty; the distortion has been turned up on the guitars yet they are at the back of the mix, so you have to pay attention to get the real noise-punk element. I like the mid-tempo evil songs and the overdriven vocals, but it is still very rock’n’roll. It’s not only an interesting artifact from an old scene, but this record would be a hit even today. The goal of today’s bands would be to make something this fresh after having heard this record, too. The LP includes an info sheet, a photo booklet of the era, a postcard, and a sticker. One of the great second acts of hardcore punk is the possibility that decades after your existence, maniacs like General Speech could re-release your stuff.\n\nReviewer Viktor Vargyai\n\nLabel General Speech\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nDrug Czars Compendium CD\n\nWith nineteen studio tracks and eight live cuts, this CD compiles what I believe is the entire recorded output of ’90s South Florida weirdos DRUG CZARS. Commandeered by former members of the EAT and ROACH MOTEL, the band played punchy outsider rock with indie and pseudo-country inflections. The tunes cover a wide spectrum of energies. Some display a driving kind of post-punk, but then they’ll break out into the rootsy hardcore of “God’s Got a Gun,” slip into a sordid din like on “Let’s Go Satan,” or reveal a Doc Dart-esque sinister side on “Someday I’ll Crush Them All Like Bugs.” They also do some covers ranging from JEFFERSON AIRPLANE to WIRE, and some of the best songs here are buried in the raw sound of the live recordings. It’s dank and infectious stuff, a strangely compelling soup that may appeal to fans of later-era GUN CLUB and THOMAS JEFFERSON SLAVE APARTMENTS.\n\nReviewer Jason Harding\n\nLabel Tequesta\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nEasy Kill What a Blow! cassette\n\nNot awful. Though it does seem like the production is the only thing to phone home about, the short length saves me from completely eviscerating it. I kind of had fun listening to it. The vocalist has some lines that made me laugh, and the guitar tone is nice and clear. I think if they work on it, they could be something special. However, some of the drum parts felt out of place, and I just don’t find anything super engaging going on here. It’s a decent listen if you just have it playing in the background, though.\n\nReviewer Neal Ray\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nFuckcrusher / Penny split LP\n\nListen, I’m a huge fan of unique vocalists, especially in a genre like punk music which requires you to think outside the box if you ever plan to shine among the crowd. And I’m really sorry here because, again, I absolutely love when bands try something different, but both of these acts are marred with grating and unlistenable singers, which is a real shame because the music is fantastic. FUCKCRUSHER plays classic multi-vocal powerviolence akin to MAN IS THE BASTARD. One of the singers sounds fine, but the other one loves to hit this piercing shrill that I cannot handle. Maybe I’m just getting old? It seems like they’re trying to go for an ULTIMATE WARRIORS vibe, but it just sounds like they’re blowing a referee whistle. PENNY plays sloppy punk rock that I was pretty excited about at first, but their singer sounds like Mickey Mouse on a bender. You know what though? The more I listen to this, the more I kinda like it. It’s oddly wholesome and charming. The whole band joins in on gang-vocal duties for their track “Tree,” and it’s truly the breakout single of this whole ordeal. Fuck it, this album is an experience, and I recommend you listen to it at least once. Maybe there is a little bit of shine here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Humdinger / Starcleaner\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nHayes Noble As It Was, As We Were CD\n\nThere’s a generally believed legend that the best punk-inspired music, in its heyday, came from Washington. HAYES NOBLE has proved this tale extends past the ’90s on his sophomore album, As It Was, As We Were. Upon listening, the album cordially invites you to a marriage between wonderfully layered shoegaze soundscapes and the hurried noise of post-hardcore. HAYES NOBLE provides the vocal hallmark of any indie band, singing of young, sultry summers and dreamy disillusionment with reality. There are many great details in the album’s composition, such as the smooth transition from the opener “Escape” to “In Search Of,” or the lovely scenic imagery evoked by “On Montrose.” The album is peppered with magic moments of gritty feedback, auric revivals of MY BLOODY VALENTINE, and an atmosphere of bedroom danceability. As for musicianship, solid bass by Everett Noble and catchy drums by Brett Noble excel on tracks like, “Blue To Grey” and “The End.” I wonder if they’re a family-comprised band, which would be cool. This June release is a definite addition to my summer soundtrack.\n\nReviewer Fiona Rae\n\nLabel Two Two One Press\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nOsbo Say It to My Face EP\n\nUSHC-inspired downer punk from Down Under. Sydney has cultivated a reputation for producing eclectic acts, and OSBO maintains that tradition in a wholly distinct way. Following up their 2020 demo, the band has honed their sound some, but make no mistake, this is just as heavy, noisy, and unhinged. They eschew the standard hardcore formula in a way that has me imagining what PISSED JEANS would sound like covering NO TREND. There is a tension arising from their oscillating tempos, where just when it seems like things have gone completely off the rails, the meandering instrumentation will snap back into a focused assault. Atop it all, the snot-addled, back-of-throat vocals propel the songs forward. OSBO pulls off the rare feat of being frenetic, unpredictable, and tight all at once. An ample reminder that it pays to keep it freaky.\n\nReviewer Matt Casteel\n\nLabel Blow Blood\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nPershing Boys Versteckt EP\n\nIt is always very tricky to review a band like PERSHING BOYS. I assume that because of their longevity and because they formed in 1985, they must have an aura locally that cannot quite be grasped from the outside, and therefore the perspective that someone familiar with their status holds is necessarily different to mine. I had never heard of the band and was never much of a Deutschpunk expert, so here we go. They are from Konstanz, South Germany, and this is their new EP, with four songs of beefy hardcore punk with lyrics in German. The production is probably too polished and clean for its own good and is lacking in aggression, especially in the band’s faster moments. However, the clever songwriting highlights the band’s energy, reminiscent of the classic German punk bands that combined melodies with direct angry punk. PERSHING BOYS manage to remain quite catchy, whether through dark choruses or epic guitar leads (there are quite a few of them, be prepared), and the songs are never dull—overall, the mood is quite dark and the EP works. I love the introduction to the last song “Fortschritt” that sounds incredibly epic and triumphant and could have been lifted from a legendary Japanese hardcore record. I suspect fans of Deutschpunk, those who have a genuine connection with the genre, will enjoy this, because it is objectively a fine EP.\n\nReviewer Romain Basset\n\nLabel Kink / Rinderherz\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nThe Pox Graveyards I Have Robbed cassette\n\nFour songs of spooky-themed, garage-tinged rock’n’roll from Montreal. A blown-out recording done “in glorious mono,” with long “scary sounds” clips between songs. This is super fun and seems like it would be an absolute blast to see performed live, especially if the POX really ham up the horror-loving aspect in their live show. An incredibly low number of these seem to have been made; mine is number 15 of 23, and while I am stoked to have a copy, I can’t help but be a little jealous that a deluxe edition of the cassette exists, which includes a bunch of different inserts as well as a “suspicious bag of dirt” all packaged within a plastic VHS clamshell case.\n\nReviewer Biff Bifaro\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nShop Regulars Shop Regulars LP\n\nWith seven self-released cassettes and six years behind them, Portland, Oregon’s SHOP REGULARS now put out their first LP. I hear vocals akin to the dourest moments of a STROKES song, and tricky rhythms that rattle on and on like White Light/White Heat-era VELVET UNDERGROUND. The latter comparison comes to mind with song length—at the shortest, “Off Season Walker” comes in at 2:22, while the B-side opens with the 11:09-long “Emerson Run Down” that jangles and ker-lumps along, dismissive of harmony, all the while lead-line side bars and quirks sun-flare over an uncompromised rhythm guitar and drum repetition that sounds like the dogma of the band: repeat, repeat, skew/deliver, repeat. Founder, guitarist, and vocalist Matt Radosevich fronts this experimental band, with drummer Patrick Barret being the only other constant since the group’s inception. Seven other musicians are credited in the notes, lending themselves (in a sound and structure) to the sort of freewheeling hippie punk thing of FAMILY FODDER. Comparisons aside, SHOP REGULARS have created their own mélange of art, oddball, electric, irreverent, and at times irksome music, in the best way possible. I’m feeling a little wobbly after so many listens, and to lift a line from the LP jacket, “it can happen to you.”\n\nReviewer Willis Schenk\n\nLabel Merrie Melodies\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nTension Pets Cubey CD\n\nSix tracks of synth-accompanied punk from this Chicago band that nestles close to the DEVO tentpole of the egg-punk umbrella. These songs are fairly traditional in their careful and accomplished arrangements, not unlike the hook-laden garage punk of TEE VEE REPAIRMANN with added interlocking synth and guitar lines. Whereas some of this genre can head down a noisy, buzzing nerdcore path, TENSION PETS deliver melodic verse-chorus-verse songs with backing vocals and quick solos. The only slight exception is the near-hardcore stomping beat of “Mansion,” although it too is catchy. It’s all very accessible and likeable, if you don’t mind some sugar in your punk. Enter the heart-tugging “Magnolia (She’s Back),” a never-was new wave classic that sounds like the CARS in the best way. Had it come out in the ’80s, its sweet melodies and lost-love lyrics would have played in every car and over countless romcom movie trailers. Total melodic gem. Check it out if you like bands like CHERRY CHEEKS and have some romance hiding out in your jaded punk heart.\n\nReviewer Nick Odorizzi\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nUltra Lights Nostalgia / Clockin Out 7″\n\nI was driving around with my wife the other day, listening to a playlist of my MRR review assignments, when this release came on. It followed up the latest album from FEN FEN, and the transition from tight, unhinged hardcore punk to languid power pop apparently got my wife’s attention, because she blurted out “What is this? It sounds like the STROKES.” She wasn’t wrong. The two tracks on this Atlanta four-piece’s debut don’t sound a million miles away from what you got on Is This It. Maybe mix that with an extremely sanitized version of the EXPLODING HEARTS, and you’ll probably get a good enough picture. In any event, it’s much less contrived-sounding than anything you’d associate with the indie sleaze set, and these are two genuinely catchy numbers. I don’t know that I’ll be dipping back into this, but I’d still be interested to see where they take things.\n\nReviewer Alex Howell\n\nLabel Chunklet Industries\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024"
