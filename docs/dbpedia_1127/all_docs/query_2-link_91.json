I would recommend this book as it is a comprehensive overview of the music industry over several decades - very interesting. Library Member\n\nGreat for music lovers The whole pack is well put together with a great selection of music and descriptions. Rose\n\nRecommended for anyone that loves Music! This book is great for teenagers that love music. I really enjoyed listening to the audio files and exploring the images provided. This book is really enjoyable and will definitely brighten up your day as well as give you useful information that you did not know.\n\nThe book explores different genres of music from the 1950s to the present day. It really does fit all tastes of music. Also, if you are studying music possibly for GCSE or A-level you might find this book especially useful, I know I would have done whilst studying music at both levels throughout my education.\n\nThey really grab the listeners imagination and gain your interest. The book is really easy to listen to as well which is an added bonus. The book is split into audio guides, with each decade of music having its own audio file so listeners can pick and choose what they listen to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this book for any teen that loves music or wants to widen their knowledge on different genres of music! Library Member\n\nSee more reviews"
