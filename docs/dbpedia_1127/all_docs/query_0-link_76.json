The album was recorded in January 2010 and released on April 13th 2010 through Red Scare Industries (often times referred to as Red Scare Records).\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nWhat, or should I say who was the first band you trusted? One of the first bands I ever trusted was the Foo Fighters. So what does that have to do with today’s album? Well developing trust in a band is huge and an incredibly joyful moment in your life. You know that, for you, there are some bands that will produce songs and albums that the moment you listen to it, you’ll undoubtedly fall in love with it. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the vocal style, the energy the band gives/brings, or maybe even the consistency… you know which bands that can do no wrong in your eyes (or ears for that matter). This is why I’m always wary of new songs/albums/bands I listen to. However with Chamberlain Waits, the Scranton, Pennsylvania native punk rockers, The Menzingers eschewed this. As soon as I heard Who’s Your Partner? I wanted more and needed to dive into this album. And sure enough The Menzingers created an easily accessible piece of punk rock beauty that has undoubtedly earned my trust.\n\nI’m going to be quite honest with you: there is nothing special about Chamberlain Waits. No grandiose intros, no blazing, face-melting guitar solos, nothing pretentious or reoccurring. It’s basic and straightforward punk rock in 12 easily accessible songs. Where as some albums grow on you, this album is a stickler. It sticks and stays with you. Your first listen of this album is the same as your last. And maybe that is what makes this album special. I mean, it’s album that doesn’t try to wow you with clever track placement or witty names. It’s just, “here it is, take it or leave it”. Nothing flashy, just pure and simple punk rock.\n\nAlbum opener, Who’s Your Partner? doesn’t even bother with the long-winded intros or the high elaborate solos. It just right down to business with simple, driving guitar riffs. It’s an overall solid song where the age old mantra of “less is more” works perfectly. Frontman and lead guitarist Tom May channels his inner Billy Bragg with the vocals. It’s throaty and guttural and powerful. Who’s Your Partner just lets energy flow and allows the drums and power chords to fire the open salvos right into I Was Born. I Was Born highlights one of the The Menzingers strongest traits: just how easy it is for anyone to enjoy their unique brand of youthful punk.\n\nThis band and album is catchy and I don’t mean like “oh hey this song is catchy”. It’s well past the category of “be wary” and into the category of “you’ll need a vaccine”, that’s how catchy they are. The Menzingers have a unique ability to write catchy, soaring, and beautiful choruses. But unlike most bands that drive these types of beautifully catchy choruses into the dirt, The Menzingers make sure to have the right amount and balance. Take for example So It Goes. So It Goes has an incredibly catchy chorus that plays twice, but it leaves you feeling like it could have been played just one more time. I think it’s one of those, teaser things to make you come back to again for more. One of my favorite songs on the album happens to be Tasker-Morris Station. It’s 2 minutes of pure east coast punk. Fast paced and gritty. The drum work powers the track and leaves you nodding along once the guitars kick in.\n\nConclusion\n\nSometimes, no, all of the time, less is more. Chamberlain Waits follows this mantra right to a “T”. It also follows the “K.I.S.S.” method. Keeping it simple, stupid. I said earlier in this post that there’s nothing special about Chamberlain Waits. That’s true, but it’s also not true. While there’s nothing special about this album, that’s what makes it special. It’s an excellent diversion from the grandiose introductions of songs, the three minute solos, and screaming vocal bridges. It’s a straightforward album that’ll have you singing along to it upon first strum of guitar. Chamberlain Waits by The Menzingers is a work of art that should stand up decades, fi not centuries from now. Though my understanding of art is probably a lot different than most.\n\nPunk rock is dead, but no one told The Menzingers.\n\n(Next Post – Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on July 24th 2001 through DreamWorks Records. The album spawned four singles, all of which reached the top twenty in the United States. The Middle reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album peaked at number 31 on the Billboard 200. The album is certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nAs we wind down the project, I have some great albums left in the tank for this year. Now then. The late 1990’s and early 2000’s was a boom or bust period for alternative rock. The market became over-saturated with bands sounding the same and failing to produce albums with individuality and uniqueness. Then you come across Jimmy Eat World, a band that was dropped by their label (Capitol Records) and had something prove. What they created with Bleed American was an incredibly cohesive, consistent, and accessible album.\n\nThere are no 16 minute long jam sessions, instead, there are straight forward rock tracks that have the energy of punk and smarts of alternative rock. The titular track, Bleed American, sets the tone for the album with aggressive and blistering vocals and guitar riffs. It has an incessant pace about it combined with an upbeat tempo and said aggressiveness. As the first single, it provided an opportunity for the band to show off that they could make a memorable and catchy song. The lyrics threw me for a loop, but the vocals are otherwise tremendous and sensational.\n\nThe Middle offers a simplistic formula that builds off of Bleed American. With a simple and excellent message about self-worth and believing in one’s self, takes the album into the mainstream. With a infectious riffs and hooks and soaring chorus, it’s easy to see why this one of the biggest hits of the band. It’s a song that builds off of Bleed American and A Praise Chorus, and adds on to it. It’s a song that is easy to jam out to and sing along to. The guitar riff is arguably one of the most recognizable riffs of the last two decades.\n\nA Praise Chorus brings the pop-rock sound with alt-rock smarts… and metric crap ton of hooks. A Praise Chorus also highlights on the strengths of Jimmy Eat World, their lyrics. All whilst using the basic of rock emotions to power the song. It’s pop rock, but it takes so much from alternative that it’s almost pop punk. Sweetness, is another track like The Middle, in that it’s incredibly anthemic. It’s hooks are hella catchy and infectious, and you will find yourself singing along to it. The lyrics are alright, nothing to write home about. But the instrumentation and vocals are crisp and sharp overall.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was an album I wore out in middle school and high school. It’s got incredibly catchy hooks combined with just as strong harmonies and melodies. None of the hooks on the album seem forced and the songs flow naturally. What this album is, is enjoyable and catchy mainstream rock that combines alternative rock with pop punk influences. Jimmy Eat World utilized powerful songwriting, emotional vocals, and driving riffs to create their own niche within a crowded music scene. Bleed American is another classic album that has withstood the test of time.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was recorded from November to December 2014 and released on March 15th 2015 through 8123 Records. The album debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200, number three on the Billboard Independent Albums, and number nine on the Billboard Top Rock Albums charts.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nYou know, modern rock, much like pop-punk and alternative rock, are crowded genres in today’s music scene. In order to separate yourself from everyone else, you have to create something that no one has heard before. That’s where The Maine come in. The Maine are a testament to how they have succeeded in the genres of alternative and modern rock since 2007 when compared to their counterparts. Since then they grown (and grown up) and matured their sound without compromising their core values, and adapted their sound to an ever shifting music scene. And thus you have one of their most well rounded albums to date, American Candy.\n\nThe album starts off the laid back, barn-burning opener, Miles Away. It’s got an air of Americana and heartland rock. The chorus soars and is immensely catchy, as you will find yourself singing along. I can see myself cruising friends down the Turnpike or some other highway singing along to this jam. It is an anthem, and pays homage to all of the homes away from home while on the road. Another track that found in the same vein as Miles Away, is English Girls. It’s a track with another infectiously catchy chorus that packs punch. English Girls seems to channel a very 90’s rock feel to it with it’s guitar riffs and chords. The song is a clear winner from the album.\n\nThe second track, Same Suit, Different Tie is a perfect compliment to Miles Away and provides for a great transition to My Hair. My Hair, is the first track to take risks and experiment on the album. My Hair has slow churning verses that just give way to a jam session of a chorus. It provides variety and diversity, keeping the pace on the album; all while keeping the album’s first half from becoming too congested. 24 Floors is easily one of the most lyrically intense songs on the album. It is a poignant and sincere track. Probably my favorite track from the album, just for how beautiful it is.\n\nThe entire lynch pin of the album rests with the eponymous track, American Candy. A track that is explosive. It pulls out all of the stops as it represents the band’s ability to continue to push their sound to the next level. The album closes with a massive sing-a-long in Another Night on Mars. Another Night on Mars reminds a lot of the closing track on their album, Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, We’ll All Be… a strong end to an incredibly strong album.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Maine are one of the hardest working bands in the music industry. Yet despite being one of the hardest working bands in the industry, they are still vastly underrated. American Candy is an incredibly strong, refreshing, and clever album. It may not pack as much punch as previous releases from the band, it is consistent throughout and stays relatively true to their signature sound. There are many catchy and carefree jams on this album that’ll have you singing along to them. It’s an album that despite the simplicity of the individual parts, it’s more than just that; more than just a sum of it’s parts. As the band states in Am I Pretty?…\n\nThere’s beauty and grace, in the flaws of your face.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on July 15th 2016 through their own label 18th & Addison LLC.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nI remember creating a playlist on Spotify and coming across recommended songs to add. One of the songs to add to said playlist was Like Porcelain by 18th & Addison. Skeptical, I clicked play and was immediately blown away by the production value and the sound. It was crisp, but raw. It was so melodic and catchy, I listened to it about five more times before checking out the band’s Little Parasites EP. From there, liking what I heard, I moved on to today’s album, Makeshift Monster.\n\nHere’s the thing: anyone can make pop-punk. Anyone. But not everyone can make GOOD/GREAT/EXCELLENT pop-punk. That my friends, is an art form. It’s an art form that 18th & Addison painted perfectly with this album. Every song has such rich and lush melodies that just catapult you into every song. I’ve found that dual vocals rarely seem to work, but the dual vocals on this album are both wonderful, but are blended seamlessly throughout. I feel like an excellent example can heard on the tenth track, Fix Me Again. Both voices compliment each other perfectly on the this track (and throughout the rest of the album). I think one of the reasons why I loved Fix Me Again, isn’t because its an acoustic number, but because it offers contrast. It’s a softer, lighter track that provides some levity. It provides some contrast when paired up with the preceding track, Little Secrets.\n\nWar, the lead single of the album, is probably one of the more “heavier” tracks on the album, and has serious power pop tone to it. It’s complete with some rather striking riffs that back the song with some high octane energy. I feel like War and the follow up track Moving Mountains would’ve fit on a radio station like Y-100. But since Y-100 (rest in peace) is no longer around, I feel like both of those track should receive airplay on Radio 104.5. One of the other standouts is All & Everything. It is a lyrically fantastic song.\n\nConclusion\n\nGreat pop-punk is an art form. It’s an art form that 18th & Addison almost mastered already with Makeshift Monster. A lyrically strong album that boast excellent dual vocals. Not only are the lyrics and vocals strong, but the music is strong as well. At no point on the album do the songs break away from the formula that Kait DiBenedetto and Tom Kunzman created. The melodies are rich and lush. The hooks are infectious. The production is sharp and crisp. There is no doubt that the duo of DiBenedetto and Kunzman have talent; Makeshift Monster is their self-released, “Welcome to the party” moment. It’s an album that takes the best of alternative rock, modern rock, power pop, and pop punk and combines them into one extremely enjoyable album.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was recorded during 2010 and released on February 15th, 2011 through Clear Entertainment/Capitol Records. Clear Enterainment is the record label of David Letterman. The album peaked at 185 on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number three on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Lead single So Obvious, peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Pop Songs chart.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nToday I figured, “hey… let’s go with something that’s generally easier on the ears. Something that’s more modern and mainstream rock sounding.” And so I scoured my music library and found this hidden gem from 2011. Runner Runner‘s self-titled debut album. The band itself is a reinvention of the successful pop-punk band, Over It. The main drawback of the album (and arguably the band,) is that it sounds too much like other modern rock albums. The production of the album is sharp and clean with pop sheen flowing throughout. While some of the songs are kinda forgettable, over-produced and somewhat auto-tuned, for the genre of pop-rock/power pop, it’s top notch.\n\nThe album opens with the the lead single So Obvious. The song was originally off a 2008 EP, that had been reworked. The result is a song that lost some production from it’s predecessor. The subtleties added to the album version of So Obvious make it a much stronger, catchier, and much fuller song. What you get are effects that play off of both the instrumentation and the lyrics… which for example is the soft heartbeat heard at the end of the song and during the breakdown.\n\nUnstoppable brings the power-pop to the album. Previously released as a single, the song received some more production. The hooks are catchier and will have you singing a long after a minute or two into. However the some slight auto-tune in the song is a drawback, but not one big enough to take down the song. She’s My Kinda Girl is another track in the vein of So Obvious. It’s a track that’ll have you singing and dancing along.\n\nI Can’t Wait is a beautiful track that is stripped down. An acoustic number that while light, it soulful and heartfelt without being too cheesy and cliched. Hey Alli, is one of the band’s previously released songs. Much like the songs on the album that were previously released, it gets an update and that update helps the song overall.\n\nConclusion\n\nRunner Runner brings together some of the bigger and biggest elements in pop, rock, and power pop. While the album has flaws, none of them are big enough drawbacks that distract the listener. The album brings together easily accessible pop rock that will have you dancing and singing along to it and more emotional elements that’ll pull at your emotions. This is pure, unadulterated mainstream rock at it’s finest.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

Welcome back to the Broad Playlist Recap for the week of March 26th. Click on the following link to go to last week’s recap! Let’s just get right down to it, here is your weekly recap!\n\nMonday, March 20th 2017\n\nOn Monday, we discussed Hall and Oates’ self-titled release, Daryl Hall & John Oates. Everyone has a favorite Hall and Oates song. Don’t lie, you know you do. It was an album that was a turning point for the duo as the album while maintaining it’s blue collar, Philadelphia blue-eyed soul, added an element of pop. The production is quite crisp and sharp.Containing the breakthrough smash hit, Sara Smile, this album is a remarkably consistent one. Click here to read about Daryl Hall & John Oates!\n\nTuesday, March 21st 2017\n\nOn Tuesday we took a trip to 1980’s West Germany and West Berlin for Die Toten Hosen‘s concept album… Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorschau. Considered to be the band’s best album to date, and one can see why. Containing their trademark style of hardcore punk, the album is musical version of the movie A Clockwork Orange, which is based off the dystopian fiction novel of the same name. Combining elements of Beethoven‘s 9th Symphony, the music delves deep into life of Alex DeLarge, the main character of the movie/novel. It’s the German version of Pink Floyd‘s The Wall. Click here to read about Ein Kleinese Bisschen Horrorschau!\n\nWednesday, March 22nd 2017\n\nFrom the 1980s German punk scene to the 1990s Seattle music scene, we took a look at Pearl Jam‘s Ten. Pearl Jam’s best selling album and most successful album to date, brought grunge rock to the mainstream. A classic album that made grunge music easily accessible to the masses. Ten is an album that help propel grunge and eventually alternative rock into the mainstream. An album that you feel the catharsis with every riff, howl, and drum hit. Click here to read more about Ten!\n\nThursday, March 23rd 2017\n\nOn the halfway point of the project, we went from the birth of alternative rock to the mid-2000s pop punk classic from Mayday Parade. A Lesson In Romantics, is an album that doesn’t try to change the world or save pop punk. Nope. What it does do is follow a formula that produces heavy catchy hooks. Chock full of sing-a-long choruses and magnificently catchy guitar riffs, A Lesson In Romantics, is an album that has the hooks, the heart, and the style that blows competitors and fellow pop-punk albums out of the water. Click here to read about A Lesson In Romantics!\n\nFriday, March 24th 2017\n\nOn Friday, we stopped the clocks with German punk band, the Donots. Coma Chameleon is an album that is caught in between albums. It’s got a more mature sound to it, but tries to cling to the old in-your-face, lightning paced riffs. It’s album that marked an evolution into a more alternative rock sound. It’s a good album that has it’s flaws, it endears itself to the listener. This one is definitely for the do-it-yourself(er), click here to read about Coma Chameleon!\n\nSaturday, March 25th 2017\n\nOn Saturday, we looked at and listened to Metallica‘s self-titled album, otherwise known as The Black Album. Metallica‘s most successful album, marked a maturation in their heavy metal. Gone were the blistering thrash metal riffs and in were the heavy, powerful, and thunderous power chords and riffs. An album that contains at least three of the band’s most easily recognizable songs, it’s no wonder why the band’s popularity exploded.

But with 2008’s Coma Chameleon, it marked a departure from the high flying, blistering, loud, and in-your-face punk rock to a more melancholic alternative rock. The album is a much more darker sound than that of their previous six albums. For those that enjoyed their previous six albums, this one may sound jarring, but that’s alright. The sound is much more mature and “grown up”. At some point a band needs to experiment with different sounds and styles to find out what works.\n\nThe album isn’t as much pop-punk as it is an evolution into alternative rock. While the catchy sing-along choruses aren’t as prevalent, they are still found on the album, especially with the singles Stop the Clocks and The Right Kind of Wrong. But from the lead single, Break My Stride, you develop a floating stream of consciousness that climaxes with Stop the Clocks. Break My Stride is a fast paced rocking track that channels the band’s previous work. Stop the Clocks, however is a more of an arena rocker and traverses into ballad territory. From there you have the punk rocker, Pick Up the Pieces and the hip hop influenced Headphones. The latter of which has a strong electric bass beat.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Coma Chameleon is a heck of a transitional album. While it moves on from the loud and proud punk of Got the Noise and eventually improves into the anthemic The Long Way Home, Coma Chameleon holds it’s own. It’s not a bad album, but it’s not great. It’s good. It has it’s flaws and turn some hardcore punk rockers off, but it does have appeal to it. It’s an album whose lyrics are nearly “universal” to the point in which everyone can understand and will relate to them. Coma Chameleon is the definition of a DIY, do-it-yourself effort. Definitely worthy of the effort.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was recorded in January of 2007 and released on July 10th, 2007 through Fearless Records. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart and at number 31 on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nThere is something you need to understand about pop-punk. A single, deep, and underlying premise: pop-punk isn’t trying to change music or the world. Nope. The earlier you understand that premise, the sooner you can appreciate and enjoy the music. That said, today’s album, Mayday Parade‘s A Lesson in Romantics, is like most pop-punk albums… except a hell of a lot better.\n\nFrom the first listen the album is chock- full of heavy hooks. That is something that A Lesson in Romantics does excellently. Catchiness is the name of the game. The mainstay of this album are it’s memorable hooks. Words to describe said hooks: breathless, melodic, and rhythmically brilliant. Not on song on the album will escape from your grasp. A prime example of this is with the opening track Jamie All Over. The track is cover, with the original song from a band by the name of Kid Named Chicago. Jamie All Over, instantly got stuck in my head. The passionate howls combined with broken guitar riffs and pounding drums work extremely well when merged together. Jamie All Over serves as one of the two end brackets with the album closer You Be the Anchor…. You Be the Anchor has some soft-speak and melodramatic vocals.It’s a track that hangs on the border of being pretentious, but manages to stay on the right side of that fine line. The soft-spoken verses give away to choruses that are buoyed by arpeggiated guitar riffs that can be heard elsewhere on the album.\n\nWhat keeps this album from going into mediocrity you may ask? It’s keeping it simple methodology. Simple sing-a-long vocals and riffs keep this album afloat. Black Cat is a prime example of this.It is a song that has nothing about it. It’s pretty bland. But the hook is what saves the song… which is a rarity.\n\nThe album follows a formula and sticks to the formula most of the time. The drumming makes sure that the emotion matches track for track. The drumming makes sure the angry songs sound angry and desperate (If You Wanted A Song…) and the contemplative songs stay on their feet and always compelling (I’d Hate to Be You…).The vocals don’t sound too over-produced, with a quality about them, that even when shouted, are some of the most convincing lyrics and vocals of the decade.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a 45 minute album, A Lesson in Romantics powers through those 45 minutes. Never does it drag along or lose it’s pace. The hooks, the heart, and everything else about this album are so well executed, it blows competitors out of the water. The is enough variety to keep this from becoming an album that sounds the same. Mayday Parade and A Lesson in Romantics sets the bar (incredibly) high for a genre where millions are trying to do the same thing.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was recorded early in 1979 and released on May 13th 1979 through Sire Records. Numerous polls in 1979 that were conducted placed The Undertones as one of (if not) the greatest albums of the 1970s and one of the Top 40 Punk/New Wave albums of all time.\n\nThoughts on the album\n\nHappy Saint Patrick’s Day everyone! While looking for an Irish band to feature today, I had to dig deep through my music library and even my dad’s music library for something to feature. Lo and behold, I found a classic. A gem. A diamond in the rough. You get it. Today’s album is the legendary, The Undertones by none other than, The Undertones. Now I know I say “legendary” or “quintessential” or “genre-defining” a lot. I get it. But this album is a classic, given the time period it was released and the war in it genre of music that was going on.\n\nThe Undertones as an album, musically, could have traveled down a couple paths. One path being influenced by disco, and becoming a mishmash of punk/new wave. Another path the band could have taken with their sound was into a hardcore punk a la The Sex Pistols. Or they could have went the route of The Jam and fused a version of the mod movement into their punk sound. With this album, you get an excellent showcase of The Undertones‘ sound, style, and conviction. The album itself is the definition of what modern pop-punk is: three chord power pop… except in this case it is crammed into lightning fast two minute songs. The songs are unapologetic on their worldview, of course that should be a given considering the songwriters weren’t even out of their teens yet! The Undertones highlights the influences that The Clash, The Ramones, and the Buzzcocks had on the band.\n\nThe Undertones scored massive success with their first single, Teenage Kicks, which I would describe as a precursor to a modern day punk rock anthem. It’s fast, loud, and carries some serious clout with a massive sing-a-long chorus. Most importantly, having heard a lot of punk bands of this time period, I can say one thing: it’s a fun song. Instead of criticizing the government or talking shop about politics or whatever the bands of the era did, they went the opposite direction and talked about teenage love and wanting to hold the hand of the girl you love. Aww…. how sweet. Ironic that this topic would be picked (back) up by pop-punk bands of the 2000s. The singles Get Over You and Jimmy Jimmy are equally as fast and fun. Jimmy Jimmy, despite being a fast paced and fun song tackles serious subject matter in suicide and depression, though it does deliver a message of optimism that their contemporaries did not.\n\nPerhaps, it is because of Feargal Sharkey’s quivering whine that makes Get Over You and Teenage Kicks less Neanderthal and more cute and fun. Or maybe it could be because of the O’Neill brother’s chipper schoolboy-like harmonies. Either way, this is a album that has aged incredibly well and it’s formula is very simple: easy four chord punk tracks all executed with enthusiasm. The album is lightning paced and finishes at around roughly 30 minutes long with the longest track being 2 minutes and 45 seconds long. There is no variation or variety, but is to be expected. The lyrics aren’t anything grandiose, complex, or heady. Sometimes, simple is better and it works here.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Undertones follow a simple methodology with The Undertones, their self-titled debut album: K.I.S.S. or Keep It Simple Stupid. The eternally youthful single, Teenage Kicks transcends time as it continues to be model for simple three/four chord pop-punk tracks of today. You arguably thank the punk movement for the return of the three minute track! Some tracks on the album may just be cheesy as hell, but it works. The album continues to stand the test of time and serve as a veteran vanguard for those who venture into the realm of three/four chord pop-punk.\n\n(Next post – Previous post)\n\nGot Social Media?

They album was released on July 26th 2005 through Fueled By Ramen. The album, while failing hit the Billboard 200, reached number 30 on the Billboard Heatseekers, as well as number four on the UK Rock Chart. The Album has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nAs a few of teenagers in my youth group know, I have a soft spot in my music library (and heart) for Paramore. I can’t begin to say enough great (and amazing things) about Hayley Williams‘ voice. As I’ve stated before, they are a fun band to listen to… and I have zero shame or guilt about listening to them. Fun (and unrelated) fact: if you’ve sung vocals on the video Rock Band or it’s many sequels, it can be awkward to sing along to a Paramore song.\n\nAnyway… if you’ve never heard Hayley Williams sing before, you should. Her voice is powerful. So powerful it can carry an album, and this power is on display with Paramore‘s debut album, All We Know Is Falling. Williams is one of the few dynamic frontwomen that can command and captivate a live audience. While it is easy to dismiss All We Know Is Falling as just another album in emo emo genre, it’s more than that. It is also easy to dismiss this album, period, but the album was an indicator of future success as they debuted a certain type/formula of pop-punk that fused angst with catchy and memorable hooks that would be developed on RIOT! and brand new eyes.\n\nWhat surprised me about this album, is just how polished it sounds considering the ages of Williams and the Farro brothers at the time of the album’s release in 2005. Hayley Williams was 17 and Zack Farro was just 15. Man… I don’t remember doing anything that memorable at those ages. I digress. Given the ages of the member of the band, it is remarkable how polished this album is.\n\nThe songs Pressure and Emergency are powered by Williams’ string and dynamic vocals along with hard rock guitar riffs. The riffs and vocals give these two songs life. These two tracks feature the band at it’s most confident and best. The differences between Emergency and Pressure are slight, but noticeable. Emergency, which I consider the best song on the album, has more attitude and atmosphere about it than Pressure or even All We Know. It’s a track that easily switches between being subdued and vicious at what I can only describe as “breakneck speed”. The melodies are more solid and sound and the chorus is absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe album opens with three songs (All We Know, Emergency, and Pressure) while it closes with three of the more interesting and different sounding songs (Conspiracy, Franklin, and My Heart). For example, All We Know is arguably the hardest and heaviest track on the album. It’s immediately noticeable from the crunch of the guitars in the intro. This is eschewed by Franklin, which is the most delicate track on the album. That delicate melody of Franklin is almost obliterated by the borderline metal of My Heart, which is complete with distorted riffs and screamed vocals.\n\nWhile my main qualms about the album is its pacing and track selection. Some tracks seem out of place, but not so much were it distracts you from listening. Each song has something that saves it from being forgettable or distracting. For example, Never Let This Go has an incredibly triumphant bridge and solo. Most likely, the album focuses too much on Hayley Williams’ voice and puts too much on it.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a debut album, it’s great, but like most debut albums it’s not the best. But it is certainly not the worst. Given the ages of the band members at the time, they’ve written a great debut album filled with angst-ridden lyrics and catchy pop-punk hooks. It’s album that’ll appeal to the core listeners while appealing to a wider audience. While it’s Paramore‘s how to say it, least amazing album, it’s worth a listen. All We Know Is Falling gives away hints of future greatness from Williams and company.\n\n(Next Post – Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?
