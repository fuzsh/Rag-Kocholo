I copy below a part of the song for the context:\n\nAre teenage dreams so hard to beat\n\nEverytime she walks down the street\n\nAnother girl in the neighbourhood\n\nWish she was mine, she looks so good\n\nI wanna hold her wanna hold her tight\n\nGet teenage kicks right through the night\n\nI think it could be something like \"adolescentada\" in spanish - although this is a non-existent word\n\nPlease, can you help me with this?\n\nCheers!\n\nHi Patrice\n\nThe expression \"to get your kicks (out of something)\" is to get extreme enjoyment/pleasure (out of/from that action).\n\nfor example,\n\n\"I get my kicks out of going to the cinema during the last showing when there is hardly anyone in the theater.\"\n\nIf you are familiar with the famous Route 66 in the USA, there is a song whose chorus is \"I get my kicks from Route 66\".\n\nHope this helps you!\n\nSo,\n\nI can say \"I get kicks of/from listening to music\", can't I?\n\nBut... Can I say \"I get kicks through listening to music\"?\n\nIt sounds good but, is it correct?\n\nThanks a lot again!\n\nPat."
