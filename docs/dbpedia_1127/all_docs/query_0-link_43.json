        "text": "There's nothing I love more in music than a perfect single. Give me an A-side I want to play over and over with another hit on the flip, and I'm a happy camper. I was a very happy camper the moment I first experienced The Lemon Drop Gang's new Rum Bar Records release \"Sweetie Pie.\" I played the lead track four times in a row because I couldn't get enough! While the format is not vinyl but rather compact disc, the effect is the same. This is a bite-sized piece of punky pop goodness from one of the best bands out there. These are the first new tunes from The Lemon Drop Gang since they unveiled their debut long player I'm Not the One! seven years ago (Rum Bar released the album on CD in 2020). And they do not disappoint! \"Sweetie Pie\" and \"The Party's Over\" will delight anyone craving more of The Lemon Drop Gang's wonderfully weird, fiercely original, and intoxicatingly tuneful desert garage pop.\n\n\"Sweetie Pie\" is vintage Lemon Drop Gang fare. It will make you want to dance and sing along even as it brandishes a sharp knife's edge. In this disdainful kiss-off of a jerky suitor, dynamic lead singer Steph O'Halloran holds back nothing. Both her lyrics and the way she chooses to emphasize them are pure gold. I love that the song is sharply humorous but also deeply profound in what it has to say about gender inequality. In typical Lemon Drop Gang fashion, this tune brings together all the best elements of garage rock, girl groups, '60s pop, and punk rock in a novel and unique way. Johnny O'Halloran's guitar playing is a true thing of beauty! On the virtual B-side, \"The Party's Over\" feels like a requiem for pre-pandemic times. The song reflects on our collective loss of innocence in a way that's truthful yet not entirely hopeless. I'm struck by the perfect harmony between Johnny O'Halloran's melodic guitar and Danny Walker's dancing bass. Steph O'Halloran, who has a gift for taking a classic pop song and twisting it into something truly haunting, is in top form on this track. Once the music stops, I find the song's melody and vocal lingering in my head.\n\nThe first great single of 2023 comes from The Lemon Drop Gang! I can think of few bands with a better grasp on how to accentuate the contrast between a pure pop melody and a classic punk rock vocal. Then again, there just aren't many living punk singers who can match the guts, power, and sheer personality of Steph O'Halloran. If these tracks are a sign of what's to come from The Lemon Drop Gang, we are definitely in for a treat with the next album. This single was recorded by Matt Rendon, and I don't think there's ever been a more perfect marriage of a band and a recording engineer. For a while, I've considered The Lemon Drop Gang one of the most underrated bands on the Rum Bar roster. If you find \"Sweetie Pie\" to your liking, do yourself a favor and acquire I'm Not The One! ASAP!\n\nSweetie Pie by The Lemon Drop Gang\n\nOne of the real bright spots in the dumpster fire of a year that was 2020 was the wonderful debut album from teenage singer Juniper. In collaboration with her dad (the veteran singer/songwriter and esteemed WFMU radio host Michael Shelley) and a star-studded cast of musicians, Juniper gifted the world with one of the most joyful guitar pop albums of recent memory. I named Juniper a top ten album for 2020, and in retrospect I wonder if I should have rated it even higher. I suppose the only downside of such an auspicious debut is that it creates very high expectations for the encore. How do you follow up a perfect pop album? Well, if you're Juniper and Michael Shelley, you just go out and make another one!\n\nShe Steals Candy is no mere copy of its predecessor, but it repeats all the core ingredients of a winning recipe. Again, Michael Shelley produces and enlists the contributions of all sorts of talented friends. Notable guest players on this album include Greg Townson (Los Straitjackets), Chris Geddes (Belle and Sebastian), Steve Goulding (Mekons), John Perrin (NRBQ), Alex Hall (J.D McPherson), Dennis Diken (The Smithereens), April March, Megan Reilly, Rebecca Turner, Karen Basset (The Pandoras), Barbara Endes (Girls On Grass), Ira Kaplan (Yo La Tengo), Page Burkum (The Cactus Blossoms), Kurt Baker, and Jon Grabo (Ryan Adams). The album mixes in a handful of original songs with an extraordinary selection of covers. While contemporary in every respect, She Steals Candy recalls the golden age of pop music — when there was no shame in working with stellar session musicians or interpreting someone else's songs. A lot of incredibly talented people had a hand in the creation of this record, and what results is something truly special.\n\nWhile still a teen, Juniper is a young adult now. Her vocal tone now carries more richness and gravity while still retaining the likeable, down to earth quality that made her an instant sensation. She gives The Sails' Brit-pop smash \"BANG!\" an added touch of melancholy — taking a great song and fully making it her own. Her interpretation of Amy Rigby's \"Baby Doll\" just about gives me chills. Without over-singing, she brings the hurt, sadness, and ultimate strength of the song's lyrics to life in a way that will be relatable to any young woman her age. She applies a similar magic touch to The Bangles' \"James\" and The Go-Go's' \"Turn To You\" — a couple of songs that were ripe for a reinterpretation after nearly four decades. Elsewhere, the Shelleys dig really deep, unearthing such forgotten gems as David \"Del Ashley\" Gates' 1965 single \"Little Miss Stuck Up\" and Johnny Fortune's 1964 track \"Don Stole My Girl\" (re-worked here as \"Dawn Stole My Guy\") along with four songs originally recorded by The Ron-Dels — Delbert McClinton's marvelous mid-'60s rootsy rock and roll band. Also delightful are a Latin-flavored arrangement of the Lisa Marr/Kim Shattuck number \"Taste the Soup\" and a bossa nova version of the Gene Simmons song \"See You Tonight\" (yeah, really!). Album closer \"I've Gotta Boy\" is a cover of First Base's modern punk-pop gem \"I've Got a Girl.\" Guitarist Tallulah Buscher plays on the track — using the same guitar, amp, and pedal that her mom Melanie Vammen used on the first Muffs album! The songs written for the album fit in splendidly. The title track, which is full of warm '70s vibes, celebrates a kinship with one's far-cooler alter ego. \"Alone with You,\" co-written by the famed writer Dawn Eden Goldstein & Peter Horvath from The Anderson Council, is a perfect power pop song. \"Ride Between the Cars\" hits quickly with a melody that I can't get out of my head.\n\nWe didn't have to wait very long for the first great album of 2023. If melody-driven guitar pop is your thing, She Steals Candy is the album for you. And if you liked the first Juniper album, you are certain to like this one even more. From the vocals to the musicianship to the production to the arrangements, everything about this album hits the spot. At a time when we're conditioned to think of cover songs as filler, it's a joy to come across a record like this that celebrates great songs. Juniper and Michael Shelley chose to record all these songs because they love them, and they'd be the first people to encourage you to seek out the original versions. I also like that if you didn't already know that most of these songs were covers, you'd probably mistake them for originals. All these tracks fit together perfectly. Even as it finds Juniper stretching herself genre-wise, She Steals Candy at its core is an indie power pop fan's delight. Singing along is both unavoidable and good for the soul. The album is out today on Confidential Recordings and Fabcom Records!\n\nShe Steals Candy by JuniperShe Steals Candy by Juniper"
