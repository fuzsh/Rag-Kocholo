It’ll make life a lot easier in the long run.\n\nCool.\n\nOnce again, thanks everyone for your feedback.\n\nI have taken the advice of some of you and had another go at playing this song to a backing track, all of the way through, minus the solo which I still have to learn.\n\nAfter a few attempts I managed it without messing up, although I did mess up the ending here, I just couldn’t change chords quickly enough.\n\nIn answer to another comment that a few of you have made, sorry, but you won’t be getting any Feargal style vocals from me. If I tried to sing John Peel really would be turning in his grave!!!\n\nHi @laser_171825\n\nGood vibes and kudos for posting yourself punk-rocking out.\n\nYou have had very encouraging comment and support and rightly so.\n\nSomeone must do it and so I guess it falls to me to be the bad cop.\n\nLook at your strumming hand. What is it doing? Or, should I ask, what is it not doing?\n\nDown, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd the movement needs to be fast… You need to aim to be playing this with a fast movement of your hand so you can strum the 8ths in the correct direction, with small wrist arcs, not big swinging motions of your forearm.\n\nJustin teaches a Down / Up then an all Down option in the song video lessons. You choose. This is the basic strum pattern / count you want to aim for if going with the Down / Up approach…\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard"
