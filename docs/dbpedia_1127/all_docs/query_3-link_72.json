        "text": "Stewart Copeland, longtime drummer of The Police, is one of the most unique drummers to come out of popular music in the last several decades.\n\nHis sound is often instantly recognizable between his diverse rhythmic influences, the way he creatively orchestrates patterns, and how he incorporates modern technology into his drum parts.\n\nLet’s talk about Stewart Copeland, and why he’s one of the greatest drummers of all time.\n\nWhy is Stewart Copeland a good drummer?\n\nThe Police drummer has a distinct style because of his motley influences (Middle Eastern music, punk rock and jazz keep things interesting). Fans know him when they hear him. His high-tuned drums were also one of multiple components that gave The Police their reggae-rock sound.\n\nWhy do people love Stewart Copeland? Let’s break it down with some of his best drum parts:\n\n1. His signature style combines unexpected influences\n\nBorn in the U.S. to a classical-loving mother and a jazz-loving father combined with a childhood spent in Egypt, Lebanon and England, Copeland grew up with many different influences.\n\nHis style combines reggae, jazz, Arabic music, Latin, and punk rock, which gives him a unique rhythmic sound. For example, unlike most pop or rock drummers, he won’t wait until the end of 8 or 16 bars to add in a fill or chop.\n\nCheck out how he adds the kick only on the ‘and’ of beats 1 and 2 in “Roxanne” by The Police:\n\nYou’ll also hear some cool syncopation in the chorus of “Next To You”:\n\nAnd the bridge of “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic”:\n\nCopeland is also known for his hi-hat work, sometimes even grooving on a hi-hat part without a backbeat in songs like “Bring On The Night” and “Darkness”.\n\nDid you know Copeland is a left-handed drummer who plays on a right-handed setup? This could explain why he often opts for busier patterns on the left side of the kit (like in “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic”).\n\n“Driven To Tears” also features some cool ride and hi-hat parts:\n\nHe incorporates toms in a unique way during the intro and first verse of “Next To You”:\n\nHe’s also taken influence from Arabic Baladi rhythms and reggae, where the bass drum emphasizes beat 3. Listen to the one drop feel in “Don’t Stand So Close To Me” and “The Bed’s Too Big Without You”:\n\nCopeland often omits the bass drum on the downbeat, which you can hear in songs like “Behind My Camel”, “King Of Pain”, and “Spirits In A Material World”.\n\nListen to how the heavy punk groove changes to a reggae groove in the chorus of “Message In A Bottle”:\n\nAnd check out the cool syncopation in “There’s A Spy In The House Of Love” by Animal Logic, one of Copeland’s other projects.\n\n2. His gear choices make his sound recognizable\n\nHis unique sound comes in part from his regular use of ice bells and Octobans. Copeland has been a consistent TAMA player with the exception of his high-tuned Pearl snare drum.\n\nDuring a time where other drummers were going for a deep, heavy sound, the Police drummer typically tuned his snare and toms up high (one exception is his work with the band Oysterhead, where he opted for a deeper tom sound).\n\nHis cross-stick work in the intro of “Reggatta De Blanc” and the verse of “Wrapped Around Your Finger” adds nice percussive elements to each respective song:\n\nListen to how he’d add delay and other effects to the drums, like in “Walking On The Moon” and “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic”.\n\n3. He thinks like a composer\n\n…because he is one. His compositions are layered and each part is carefully orchestrated. Copeland has worked on soundtracks for movies like Wall Street and We Are Your Friends, shows like The Equalizer and The Amanda Show, games like the Spyro series and Alone In The Dark, and composed music for huge orchestras.\n\nThis composer’s mindset has resulted in cool overdubs, like the tom dubs in the verse of “Message In A Bottle”.\n\nIf you listen to Copeland’s solo album The Rhythmatist, you’ll hear a unique blend of acoustic and electronic sounds from the studio with raw recordings from his time in Africa.\n\nFor more sheet music and a deep dive into the entire Police discography, you can find note-for-note transcriptions, drumless play-along tracks and helpful practice tools (among thousands of other resources) in the Drumeo members area.

Focus on maintaining steady control and smooth transitions between dynamic levels.\n\nSyncopation workout: Play a basic rock beat on the drum kit and introduce syncopated accents on the snare drum or toms. Explore different syncopated patterns and incorporate them into fills to add excitement and unpredictability to your drumming.\n\nOctoban exploration: If you have octobans or additional toms, experiment with playing melodic patterns using different tom sizes. Create short melodic phrases and incorporate them into your drumming, enhancing your playing with musical motifs.\n\nThis drum solo by Styx’s drummer, Todd Sucherman, is a great example to follow:\n\nEmbrace experimentation and explore different musical influences to unlock your creativity and become a versatile and innovative drummer, just like Mr. Copeland himself.\n\nLegacy and influence\n\nStewart Copeland is a trailblazer who has had a major impact on the world of music.
