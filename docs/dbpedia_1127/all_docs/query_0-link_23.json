        "text": "As a child growing up in an Irish household, Irish music was part of my upbringing. Which meant there was a plethora of Irish compilation CDs. One of my favorites was Tom Dunne’s 30 best Irish Hits, and once I got an iPod it was one of the first CDs to be uploaded. Some of my favorite songs are featured on this album, such as Horslips (1973) “Dearg Doom,” The Undertones (1978) “Teenage Kicks,” and The Boomtown Rats (1979) “I Don’t Like Mondays.” While the album has them all under the category of rock, they are all part of different genres of rock. Horslips were Celtic Rock, The Undertones were punk rock, and The Boomtown Rats were considered New Wave. I couldn’t decide which one to share so I thought I’d share all three. Between the years of 1973 and 1979 these three songs show a shift in music genres and influences between Celtic rock, punk rock, and new wave.\n\nAren’t those ‘70s jumpsuits something?\n\n“Dearg Doom” is based on Irish mythology and legend. The lyrics reflect the story of Dearg Doom or the “Red Destroyer,” which is part of The Táin. It begins with a simple cymbal and a count in, you then hear the guitar riff that will play for most of the song but is only dropped out when the uilleann pipes are introduced. It’s not until the halfway through the song you really hear the Celtic/Irish influence with the use of these pipes (similar to a bagpipe but you don’t blow into them, you use your elbow).I never really understood the lyrics but he is definitely someone you wanted to steer clear of.\n\nInstead of focusing on the political uneasiness in Ireland in their music The Undertones turned their focus on teenage angst and heartache. Their single “Teenage Kicks” is a punk rock song that embodies that message of teenage life. It reverted back to the whole teenage rebellion idea of the ‘50s. While in England this summer I attended a concert where one of the openers was a young British band called The Vamps, I guess I should have suspected it (being in the UK and all) but I almost jumped out of my seat when they started to cover this song.\n\nI think I was singing this song before I really understand it. “I Don’t Like Mondays” by The Boomtown Rats, was written about a shooting spree in San Diego, California. The Boomtown Rats are considered New Wave. The song is mostly keys, claps, and harmonies. Simple yet startling, the music moves with the lyrics and follows the story from beginning to end.\n\nThese genres all influenced each other; Celtic Rock shifted traditional Irish music to rock, while rock shifted to punk rock, and punk rock shifted to New Wave. The three Irish Artists are some of my favorites and show how earlier music influences newer music."
