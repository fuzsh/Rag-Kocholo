        "text": "The End of the Beginning\n\n(Or, Bitte, Kann ich haben eine Fribble?)\n\nAs discussed in Part 1, the first generation of New York City Hardcore Punk bands (1980 â â82) were essentially musicians trying to reclaim punk and post-punk for a younger audience. Most of the contributors to the budding hardcore scene had been 12 â 16 years old when the Pistols and Ramones emerged, and had therefore been too young to actively participate in that âfirst wave.â But circa 1980, these same people (now in their late teens and early 20s) were very eager to create their âownâ punk rock and post-punk, informed by the earlier music yet inclusive of a musical and iconographic style that reflected a changing social and creative environment.\n\nFew of those â80 â â82 NYHC bands played music that would now be recognized as pure hardcore, and nor did they want to. I believe they considered themselves punk acts, post-punk acts, art-rock acts, activist rock acts, funny-rock acts, etcetera, but as they were swept away by the momentum of an exciting national movement, virtually all of them adopted some aspect of the iconography, lyrical harangue, and hyper-kinetic rhythm that was characteristically hardcore. In some ways, it is unfortunate that virtually every American âthird waveâ punk band (the first wave being the initial â75 â â77 explosion, and the second wave being the â78 â â80 group, typified by Stiff Little Fingers, Undertones, Ruts, et al.) were engulfed, to some greater or lesser degree, by the hardcore thing; ideally, a âpureâ punk third wave should have been allowed to flourish in America, as it did (to a certain degree) in the U.K. (and although much of the U.K. âthird waveâ was lumped under the Oi Movement, in general there was more of stylistic and philosophical continuum between first/second wave punk and Oi then there was in the U.S. between first/second wave punk and hardcore. Now, that sentence sounded a bit academic, but if you stuck with me, Iâll buy you a Fribble one day).\n\nFalse Prophets, Even Worse, the Undead, and Stimulators (to name four) were pretty much straight punk rock acts, each with differing stylistic and ideological accents; Reagan Youth, AOD, and Kraut were more-or-less straight-up punk bands, too, but they occasionally integrated double and quadruple-timed hardcore rhythms; and the wonderful Nihilistics seemed on one hand to borrow from Crass and on the other anticipate the Swans. In fact, in this âfirstâ generation of New York Hardcore, the only acts I would label as being (more or less) âpureâ hardcore would be Heart Attack, the Mob, and the Beastie Boys (let me note here that Heart Attack were a blunt, often stunning group, shattering and direct, and theyâve never quite gotten their due; after Misfits and Bad Brains, they were probably the best band on the scene).\n\n(Itâs important to note that the groups who are most frequently identified as being âearlyâ NYHC bands â say, Murphyâs Law, Cro-Mags, Agnostic Front â evolved after this first wave. Those bands were a distinct and very powerful second generation of NYHC…but right now, we are discussing the diverse and occasionally shambholic first generation.)\n\nOut of this small list, the clear leader was the Bad Brains; none of these groups could ever hope to hold a candle to the explosive, radical, original genius and nearly miraculous level of craftsmanship and showmanship the Bad Brains brought to every gig during this time.\n\nThe Bad Brains constant gigging provided the centerpiece for the first eraâs socializing (and band forming), and the Bad Brains were also extremely supportive of the scene growing up around them. Although New York also laid a somewhat tenuous claim to New Jerseyâs Misfits (who were also very damn fierce in terms of performance, songwriting, and iconography), the Misfits more or less abdicated as potential scene-leaders, choosing instead to focus on a more global and long-term game plan.\n\nIt is also very important to note that the Bad Brains changed radically towards the end of this first era; by the end of 1982, their gigs were largely oriented towards their reggae compositions, and by mid-1983 they had made a more-or-less full transition to reggae. I could theorize that the Bad Brains absolutely unchallenged musical superiority intimidated this first generation of bands from playing pure hardcore (and itâs true that the explosion of area bands playing music clearly identifiable as hardcore happened only after the Bad Brains stopped playing so damn fast); but I donât think thatâs true.\n\nI think itâs far more likely that the â80 â â82 NYC scene bands played a more âtraditionalâ form of punk simply because a) they wanted to, b) their prime desire was to interpret â75 â â79 punk in their own Lower East Side way, and c) their main interest was in the teen empowerment and generationally distinctive inconography implied by hardcore, not in the caricature hardcore sound itself.\n\nBy mid and late 1982, the next generation of New York hardcore was becoming established. This would be the generation that would perform music immediately identifiable as hardcore, and would later be more firmly identified with the story of NYHC. Personally, I lost interest; by late 1982, the on-stage efforts of any band you saw — even if it was a well known national or international act — were overshadowed by the antics of the audience, and personally, I couldnât quite make sense of a musical scene where the moshpit and the stage-divers seemed more important than the music itself. I am not looking down my nose at that behavior, Iâm really not; itâs just that not my, uh, thing. Circa â82 I had also noted that some of the first-generation hardcore bands were trying to take steps away from their original sound, and were being (at best) ignored, and more frequently ridiculed; a perfect example of this was TSOL, whose outstanding, pre-goth, keyboard-driven second album, Beneath the Shadows, was largely ignored; similarly, Bad Religionâs second album, the synth-heavy, slower-rhythmâd Into the Unknown was subject to so much ridicule that the band later virtually denied that it had ever existed. A scene in which an act was prohibited from growing creatively was of little or no interest to me.\n\nNow, none of this is to denigrate the next (post â82) generation of New York-based âpureâ hardcore bands; not only did these groups contains some mighty players and some extraordinary characters (John Joseph of the Cro-Mags is one of the great frontmen in New York rock history), but the ultimate success and staying power of speed metal and death metal has validated these groups hunches and innovations.\n\nLooking back, I recognize that the first generation of NYHC was, to a great degree, hardcore only in name. We had a tremendous desire to link the new âthird waveâ punk coming out of the East Village with the maelstrom of new punk (labeled as hardcore) coming out of the rest of the country. Ultimately, I believe that it may have been unfortunate that we had to âtag alongâ on a national movement (as ferocious as that movement was); itâs very interesting to consider what would have happened if we had allowed this ânewâ third-wave New York punk to assert itself without the stylistic and ideological limitations of hardcore and without having to be tagged with the label of a movement that ultimately became creatively restrictive.\n\nFinally, Sting is a tool, and we warm ourselves with the salty tears he sheds over the failure of Come Sail Away or Shipâs Ahoy or Capeman, or whatever that musical he wrote was called.\n\nIn Part 3: New York Hardcore and My Part in it’s Upfall\n\nFrom the Web\n\nI have just learned of the death of Jochen HÃ¼lder, who passed about three weeks ago.Â I ask for your patience as I write a few words about the passing of a man youâve likely never heard of, who managed a band whose name probably only a few of you will know.\n\nJochen HÃ¼lder managed a band called Die Toten Hosen.Â Die Toten Hosen are likely the biggest band youâve never heard of.\n\nUnder HÃ¼lderâs extraordinary, creative, inventive guidance, Die Toten Hosen (who formed in DÃ¼sseldorf in 1982) grew to become (by far) the biggest rock act in German history, and one of the most successful rock acts in the non-English speaking world.Â And it isnât just that DTH were/are big (and they are really, really big; it would be safe to say that in Germany, they are bigger than U2 and the Foo Fighters combined, and when it comes to their place in German rock culture, perhaps the only effective comparisons would be Queen or the Stones); it is how they are big.\n\nDie Toten Hosen (which translates as The Dead Pants) were The Clash who became the Beatles, and under HÃ¼lderâs guidance, they never forgot, not for one moment, the musical, political, social, economic, cultural, and stylistic values that lay at their origin.Â Back in the 1970s and â80s, those of us who supported punk rock knew a secret:Â that if the world could actually hear the music un-adulterated, they would really like it.Â It often seemed there was an active conspiracy to prevent a large-scale American audience from hearing the beautiful, powerful, melodic, passionate, meaningful music of America (and Britainâs) punk bands; it was taken for granted that Joe Plumber and the programmer at Joe Plumberâs radio station would never play true punk rock.Â Nirvana, amongst others, changed that perception dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nYou will dig this. I promise.\n\nHÃ¼lder and Die Toten Hosen took the logic of the mass acceptance of punk rock for granted.Â They accepted as fact the idea that every rock fan in the country would want to hear the sound of classic UK/U.S. punk rock, and they took it for granted that including advocacy, charity, and compassion in that mission was an absolutely requirement; they also embraced the controversy that their left-wing and pro-immigrant positions engendered not only without fear, but with joy.\n\nHÃ¼lder took a band whose primary musical models was Sham 69, Johnny Thunderâs Heartbreakers, the U.K. Subs, etcetera and not only said âThis band can be bigger than Led Zeppelin,â he actually made it happen (note:Â Johnny Thundersâ last performance was as a guest on DTHâs version of âBorn To Loseâ).Â He did this via remarkable, corny, aggressive, and sometime ridiculous marketing tricks, all based on the idea that everyone in Germany needed this music and this message in their home.Â Some might compare HÃ¼lder to Malcolm McLaren, except we must recall that McLaren was a charlatan and a thief who ultimately cared far more about his own self-promotion and his own sense of concept than he cared about the success or well-being of his artists, and the last thing McLaren cared about was using his music to effective positive social, economic, and cultural change.Â HÃ¼lder never forgot the big picture.\n\nNow, Iâm not going to pretend that DTHâs music was pure as the driven snow â ultimately it evolved, quite effectively, into a high-quality and ballad-laden punk/pop/classic rock hybrid that (to American ears) might sound like Bon Jovi guesting with the Real McKenzies and playing Vibrators and Lurkers songs â but they did it the right way, they were a punk rock band that took over the world (at least the considerable parts of it that spoke German), and never sacrificed the values and joy that made them start off in the first place, and they recognized that an essential part of being a punk rocker was standing up for the oppressed.Â Oh, and some of their best songs are just the kind of extreme, riotous, fist-in-air singalong drinking songs you always hoped a German punk rock band would play.\n\nI have written, on a number of different occasions, of how completely and utterly important it is to make this extraordinary cultural meme called rock mean something; about how obscene it is to appropriate the clothes and words of the disenfranchised, without actually working for the disenfranchised; about how rockânâroll is the almost magical distillation of the artistic, melodic, and rhythmic innovations of people who had nothing, who were the utter dregs of society, and how we must honor that legacy.\n\nDie Toten Hosen actually pulled this off.Â And we have to recognize Jochen HÃ¼lder as one of the greatest rock managers of all time.\n\nFrom the Web\n\nI understand that Tom DeLonge of Blink-182 has written a long and heartfelt letter to his fans, explaining and apologizing for his groupâs dysfunction and inactivity.Â I respect that kind of outreach.Â In fact, I respect it so much I thought I would write my own letter to Blink-182âs fans.\n\nDear Blink-182 Fans:Â\n\nI have never really listened to Blink-182, but I respect them.\n\nMaybe that surprises you.Â Well, a long time ago, I learned there was an unspoken brotherhood amongst musicians and music geeks.Â Whether you are a member of Bon Jovi or Lightning Bolt, chances are you were the guy or girl in your high school who had the coolest record collection, who new insane and arcane details about your favorite musicians, who followed about fourteen weird bands for every one group in the pop charts.Â Seriously, itâs an odd secret, but I guarantee itâs true: Pretty much anyone whoâs put the time and effort into learning an instrument, pursuing a career, and putting up with all the bullshit surrounding the music business is bound to be a serious lover and student of music. So, regardless of any personal relationship I may or may nor have with Blink-182âs music, I respect them as brothers, people who cared deeply about music, and who made that obsession into a lifelong career.\n\nAnd I respect their fans.\n\nSee, I am not going to play that game where I look down on you because you like Blink 182 but donât like hipper, older, more obscure, or more credible bands.Â For instance, I enjoy 20th Century neo-classical music; I like, oh, Aaron Copland, Krzysztof Penederecki, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Iannis Xenakis, etcetera.Â But thereâs definitely someone out there who will go âThat guy is a douche!Â He doesnât know any Morton Gould or Benjamin Britten!Â What a Neanderthal that Sommer cat is!âÂ Now, the fact that I canât name any compositions by Benjamin Britten doesnât mean I love or enjoy Terry Riley any less.Â And the same goes for you.Â Just because you canât name any songs by, oh, the Dils or Crass or the Weirdos or the Pointed Sticks doesnât mean that you arenât as moved when you hear a song by Blink-182.Â If a song reached your heart, if you heard something and thought âI cannot wait to share that with my best friend!â or âLooking forward to hearing that song got me through class today,â thatâs all that matters! What possible difference does it make how famous or how obscure it is.Â Shit, I spend a lot of my time listening to music you probably couldnât even spell, but it still makes me deliriously happy to hear âRay of Lightâ by Madonna, and I have no trouble screaming that fact to the world.\n\nI am not going to look down on anything that moves anyone, provided it doesnât espouse any hurtful or hateful bullshit or dogma.\n\nSee, thereâs nothing wrong with popularity, nothing wrong with liking the popular. Â Regardless of whether you listen to the most obscure noise from Brooklyn or the most mainstream pop, you probably listen to it for the same reason:Â it moves you, it distracts you, it makes your day better, it gives you something to talk about with your friends or the people you want to be friends with, it says something for you that you cannot say yourself.Â I feel that way when listening to âFiery Jackâ by the Fall or âBrandoâ by Scott Walker; someone else may feel the exact same thing when listening to Nickelback or Darius Rucker.Â The messenger may change, but the listenerâs motivation and heart stays the same.Â A song that creates an amazing shared memory for someone is a spectacular gift, and I am not going to ridicule it, whether itâs by the Mekons or Miley Cyrus.\n\nNow, as long as I have your attention, let me tell you a little about punk rock.\n\nTo me, more than anything else, punk rock means the freedom to be yourself and have your own opinion, and dream big dreams and love those dreams with all your heart, despite the naysayers; I believe punk rock is literally the opposite of conformity and bending to peer pressure.Â More than a âsound,â it is just the idea of an unfettered, un-tethered imagination.Â I also believe it is essentially a simple art form, where you discover and express beautiful, strong, powerful, intensely creative dreams that others might say are âtoo obviousâ to express; in other words, people looked at the work of Picasso, Mondrian, and Pollock and said âMy kid could do that,â or they heard the Ramones and said âShit, anyone could play like that.âÂ But NO ONE had painted like that, no one had played like that. If you could do it, why didnât you do it?Â If your kid could have done it, why didnât you encourage him or her to do so? Â Often, beauty, genius, and invention are as obvious as the air we breathe. Punk Rock artists discover a new country, the one that was in front of us and under our feet and in our dreams the whole time; the one whose beauty and power was so obvious, it was like discovering a delicious, nutritious fruit just sitting there hanging from a low branch of a tree, and everyone else said âIf itâs that easy to pick, why hasnât someone already eaten it?Â It must suck.â\n\nHaving said that, consider your love for Blink 182 a doorway.Â Let that door lead you to the soul, spirit, joy, compassion, simplicity, artistic adventure and discovery, and immediate magic of Punk Rock.Â Donât mourn the demise of your favorite band; instead, celebrate what you loved about them and let that door lead youâ¦\n\nTo the truth:Â Punk rock, first and foremost, is an expression of what moves you, without the shadow of peer pressure.\n\nTo the visceral:Â punk rock is about discovering the beauty and power of the obvious and everyday; the hum of a refrigerator can be punk rock; the ticking of a signal indicator can be punk rock; the one-chord passion of an old rockabilly song can be punk rock.\n\nTo the adventurous:Â blow it all up and put it back together any damn way you want, any goddamn way that has the power to move you; and if it moves you, thereâs a very good chance it will move someone else. That strange sound you want to hear over and over?Â I bet someone else wants to hear it, too. Trust your ears and heart.\n\nPerhaps you have the desire to be a ârealâ punk.Â If so, please note:Â A lot of the visual and iconic language of your âmovementâ is borrowed from the language of rebel politics and the battles of the disenfranchised to gain equality and socio-economic power.Â Go to the roots of this iconography:Â Donât just âsayâ fight for your rights; actually fight for your rights, and other peoples. Literally nothing is âmoreâ punk rock then helping those who have less, those who have no power, and protecting those who are in harms way. Itâs not enough to âgive the wrong time/stop a traffic lineâ as the brilliant Johnny Rotten wrote in âAnarchy in the U.K.âÂ Ideally, a punk should give the right time to someone who canât afford a watch, and clear traffic in front of an abortion clinic.\n\nOhâ¦if a band you like has ever done anything intentionally racist, sexist, homophobic, or refused to condemn any section of their fans that have done the same, then none of this applies.Â Any band that doesnât defend the disenfranchised, that is the artistically, economically, socially, sexually, politically disenfranchised, are just posers.\n\nGood luck to you.Â Timothy A. Sommer\n\nP.S. Here are some records you might like:Â âTeenage Kicksâ or âMy Perfect Cousinâ by the Undertones; âWhere Were Youâ and âMemphis, Egyptâ by the Mekons; âInto the Valleyâ and âThe Saints are Comingâ by the Skids; âBabylonâs Burning,â âStaring at the Rude Boysâ and âWest Oneâ by the Ruts; âHurry Up Harryâ and âHersham Boysâ by Sham 69; âEndangered Speciesâ and âNew Barbariansâ by the UK Subs; anything at all off of the albums Damned Damned Damned, Machine Gun Etiquette, The Black Album, or Strawberries by the Damned; âNobodys Heroâ or âAlternative Ulsterâ by Stiff Little Fingers; âOne Chord Wondersâ by the Adverts; âThe World the Day Turned Day-Gloâ by X-Ray Spex; the entire Pink Flag and Chairs Missing albums by Wire; âThis is the Modern Worldâ by the Jam; and a thousand and eight more, especially the Metal Box/Second Edition album by Public Image Limited, the greatest and most creatively brave punk rock record of all time.\n\nFrom the Web"
