        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – We’re in the midst of a pop-punk revival. And everyone seems to be moshing like it’s 2004.\n\nThe acts pushing this new renaissance are just as unlikely as the revival itself, from British musician Yungblud to rapper-turned-rocker Machine Gun Kelly to Roc Nation signee Willow. Yet, the one thing they all have in common is that they borrow from the acts that made pop punk a mainstream commodity in the first place.\n\nAs the name suggests, pop punk has its roots in punk rock. The genre, which took punk’s aggressive sound and dressed it up in pop melodies, rose to prominence in the 1990s and then exploded to the masses in the 2000s. But pop punk has its roots in the 1970s when bands like Ramones, Buzzcocks and The Undertones laid the groundwork for a new scene and sound.\n\nBands like wendents, Green Day, Blink-182 and Paramore took pop-punk to different places in different eras. But just like today, it all comes back to the core elements of fast tempos, loud guitars, power chord changes and pop melodies.\n\nThe result is a tremendous feeling of nostalgia that we haven’t had since the glory days of the Warped Tour. Just look at the buzz generated by the When We Were Young festival taking place this fall in Las Vegas, which boasts a who’s who of pop-punk, emo and post-hardcore bands from years past.\n\nIn honor of pop-punk’s latest surge into the mainstream, we’re counting down the 100 greatest pop-punk songs of all time. The list includes the biggest and best hits the genre has seen as well as the songs that influenced the sound in the first place.\n\n100. Lustra - “Scotty Doesn’t Know” (2004)\n\nBoston-born band Lustra was formed under the name Seventeen during the late 1990s. Despite showing promise in the alt-rock scene, the band’s rise was slowed by a legal battle with “Seventeen” magazine. Once the band changed its name to Lustra, things picked up. Much of that is owed to “Scotty Doesn’t Know” a raucous pop-punk anthem about a girl cheating on her boyfriend. The lyrics pull no punches when it comes to being crude (“I did it on his birthday)”. The inclusion of “Scotty Doesn’t Know” on the soundtrack for the film “EuroTrip” (with an hilarious performance by Matt Damon) cemented its status as a hit.\n\n99. All - “She’s My Ex” (1989)\n\nFormed by three members of the Descendents, All would take its predecessor’s pioneering sound to more emotional levels with songs about love and heartbreak. Nothing shows this more than “She’s My Ex,” which infuses pop punk with new wave and power pop. That style would prove highly influential when it came time for pop-punk to reach for the mainstream in the 1990s. It’s hard to envision a song like Green Day’s “When I Come Around” or Blink-182′s “Josie” ever happening without “She’s My Ex” arriving years earlier.\n\n98. Midtown - “Just Rock and Roll” (2000)\n\nBefore he became an entrepreneur and before he was scoring top-10 hits with Cobra Starship, Gabe Saporta was a pop-punk kid at heart. His band Midtown didn’t reach the heights of the genre’s other early 2000s bands. But Midtown still holds a special place in fans’ hearts. “Just Rock and Roll,” the opening track from Midtown’s debut album “Save the World, Lose the Girl,” shows off Saporta’s punk influences and his ability to write a catchy hook early on in his career. Whenever Saporta is asked to list his favorite songs, he always includes “Just Rock and Roll” -- his first significant turn as a songwriter.\n\n97. Smoking Popes - “Need You Around” (1995)\n\nSmoking Popes brought genuine emotion to pop-punk in the early 1990s, peaking in 1995 with the unforgettable “Need You Around.” Lead singer, guitarist and chief songwriter Josh Caterer had a voice that sounded more in line with The Smiths or Joy Division. It became one of Smoking Pope’s definite weapons alongside Caterer’s introspective lyrics about love. “Need You Around” was a precursor to just about every song Fall Out Boy wrote during the early 2000s.\n\n96. Hey Monday - “Homecoming” (2008)\n\nIf the opening chords to Hey Monday’s “Homecoming” sound eerily familiar to 2000s pop-punk fans, they should. The song was included on Fall Out Boy’s mixtape “Welcome to the New Administration” in 2008 (the band was signed to Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz’s label Decaydance). Hey Monday was being hailed as the genre’s next big thing but never fulfilled the hype. Still, frontwoman Cassadee Pope did go onto bigger things as the first female winner of “The Voice” in 2012.\n\n95. Real Friends - “Late Nights in My Car” (2013)\n\nReal Friends became a mainstay on the pop-punk scene in the mid-2010s with songs like “I Don’t Love You Anymore” and “Empty Picture Frames.” But to trace the band’s ascension, you have to go back to 2013′s “Put Yourself Back Together” and its standout, emo nostalgia trip “Late Nights in My Car.” Real Friends toured with a loaded collective of other bands in the 2010s. But nothing brought the crowd to a roar quite like “Late Nights in My Car.”\n\n94. Green Day - “Welcome to Paradise” (1994)\n\n“Welcome to Paradise” has about as rich a history as any Green Day song. It was first featured on Green Day’s influential Lookout! Records album “Kerplunk.” The band and producer Rob Cavallo thought enough of its potential to give it a refined sound for 1994′s landmark “Dookie.”\n\n93. Sum 41 - “In Too Deep” (2001)\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how huge Sum 41 was. No pop-punk band has ever written catchier choruses. Sum 41 followed up its breakthrough “Fat Lip” with “In Too Deep,” another infectious anthem leaning even more to the pop side of things. “In Too Deep” went platinum and cemented Sum 41 as not just one of the biggest acts in pop punk, but one of the biggest bands in the world.\n\n92. Man Overboard – “Dead End Dreams” (2011)\n\nIt’s not hard to identify Man Overboard’s influences. The band fully embraces the emo side of pop punk once ruled over by bands like New Found Glory and Saves the Day. Man Overboard’s best song, “Dead End Dreams” is on par with some of the best material from those pop punk legends. The band’s self-titled sophomore album was produced by NFG co-founder Steve Klein, who knew how to give fantastic songs like “Dead End Dreams” emotionally charged polish.\n\n91. Fenix TX - “All My Fault” (2000)\n\nFenix TX released just three studio albums. But the band made its mark on the pop-punk scene of the early 2000s. The catchy “All My Fault” became a radio hit and earned a spot in the 2000 TV movie “Jailbait.” The movie isn’t all that memorable. But a deeper look at Fenix TX’s catalog shows a handful of very catching tunes from that time (including “Threesome” and “Phoebe Cates”). And a song like “All My Fault” stands as an essential part of any playlist attempting to capture pop punk’s 21st-century rise.\n\n90. Paramore - “That’s What You Get” (2008)\n\nParamore was always pointing toward the dance-pop that’s taken the band to new heights in the 2010s. “That’s What You Get’s” is just as much a pop-punk song as it is influenced by genres like disco, funk and power-pop vibes. The song was the emotional tour de force from Paramore’s “Riot!” that fans continue to go back to, for good reason. More than any song on that album, “That’s What You Get” foreshadows Paramore’s consistent ability to write stellar pop tunes.\n\n89. Good Charlotte - “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” (2002)\n\nGood Charlotte released three singles from its self-titled debut in 2000. They went nowhere. It wasn’t until the band hit on something more universal that things took off. “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” was something everyone could relate to -- Ragging on rich people. And it came with all the snark pop-punk fans could handle. Of course, there’s always a certain level of irony in a case like this. “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” was a top 20 hit that would make Good Charlotte a lot of money.\n\n88. The Academy Is... - “Checkmarks” (2006)\n\nEvery band has that one song that hooked you. For The Academy Is... that track is “Checkmarks.” The song comes with a fiery punch most of the other bands on the Fueled by Ramen label were lacking, making The Academy Is... an act both pop and rock fans could love. The Chicago outfit benefitted from tours with Fueled by Ramen’s biggest bands. But “Checkmarks” remains a pop-punk favorite.\n\n87. Knuckle Puck - “Disdain” (2015)\n\nKnuckle Puck didn’t waste any time endearing itself to fans. A series of EP’s laid the groundwork before the band even released a proper album. But 2015′s “Copacetic” marked a new peak for the current pop-punk era with the epic lead single “Disdain” at the forefront. Knucklepuck’s music is heartfelt and catchy, with songs like “Disdain” helping keep pop punk alive during the mid-2010s.\n\n86. Goldfinger - “Here in Your Bedroom” (1996)\n\nThe intersection between pop-punk and ska-punk was prevalent in the mid-1990s. So, it wasn’t surprising to see ska newbies Goldfinger get in on the action. The band’s catchy single “Here in Your Bedroom” doesn’t sound anything like a pop-punk song during its first minute or so, remaining true to the band’s ska origins. But the explosive chorus is a pop-punk tornado that would serve as a blueprint for hw bands meshed the two genres moving forward.\n\n85. American Hi-Fi - “Flavor of the Weak” (2001)\n\nAmerican Hi-Fi may be a one-hit-wonder in mainstream music circles. But it’s one heck of a hit. Capitalizing on the rise of pop-punk in a new century, American Hi-Fi turned up the bounce and playful riffs on “Flavor of the Weak,” a song that top-40 radio couldn’t get enough of.\n\n84. Machine Gun Kelly feat. Blackbear - “My Ex’s Best Friend” (2020)\n\nIf someone told you just three years ago that rapper-turned-rocker Machine Gun Kelly would be the face of pop punk’s revival, you’d call them crazy. It’s something that probably still makes a few people roll their eyes. But it’s impossible to deny his impact on the genre’s resurgence. When MGK announced he’d be releasing a pop-punk album, few knew what to expect. Then the album’s third single “My Ex’s Best Friend” hit and MGK was suddenly the face of pop punk’s revival. Who saw that coming? Well, maybe Travis Barker, who produced the song/album. The two are hard at work on MGK’s next pop-punk opus.\n\n83. Against Me! – “Thrash Unreal” (2007)\n\nAgainst Me!’s 2007 album “New Wave” was both a commercial and creative breakthrough for the punk band. Some fans would scream sellout for the move to Sire Records. But the music proved exceptional. The album’s second single “Thrash Unreal” is not a thrash song. It finds Against Me! dabbling in pop-punk on a melodic and jarringly honest song about drug addiction.\n\n82. The Dickies - “Banana Splits” (1979)\n\nPop-punk pioneers The Dickies were about as influential on the genre as any act not named Ramones of Buzzcocks. The California punk band’s ability to incorporate catchy melodies and bright harmonies into their songs made them a playful alternative to hardcore music. “Banana Splits” is The Dickies’ best-known song and their most influential. It helped inject life into a California scene that would eventually push pop-punk to mainstream heights.\n\n81. Screeching Weasel - “Hey Suburbia” (1988)\n\nName a 1990s pop-punk band that wasn’t influenced by Screeching Weasel...Yeah, good luck with that. Screeching Weasel was the definition of punk mentality meets melodic, catchy rock. On “Hey Suburbia,” the band plays the role of “lazy bums” to perfection, tackling a top -- boring suburban life -- that would become a hallmark top of the pop punk genre. One listen and you’ll realize how Screeching Weasel gave Green Day, Blink-182, All-American Rejects and more their style.\n\n80. Blink-182 - “The Rock Show” (2001)\n\nLove and rock music. They’ve always gone hand in hand. But it was Blink-182 (because, of course, it was) that crafted the ultimate song about going to a rock club and falling in love with a girl. In doing so, “The Rock Show” became a quintessential pop-punk anthem that any band can cover at any time and save their setlist.\n\n79. Story of the Year - “Until the Day I Die” (2003)\n\nNot every 2000s pop-punk fan is a diehard fan of Story of the Year. But they all (yes, all of them) know the words to “Until the Day I Die.” Story of the Year’s mix of pop-punk, post-hardcore and emo goes for broke with its heart-pounding sentiment and epic chorus that was unforgettable.\n\n78. State Champs - “Elevated” (2013)\n\nNo current act in pop-punk crafts more sincere and well-rounded tunes on a more consistent basis than State Champs. And it’s been that way since the very first song on the band’s very first album. “Elevated” is the kind of precise pop-punk anthem that feels like it could be a massive hit during any pop-punk era.\n\n77. Descendents - “Silly Girl” (1985)\n\nDescendents stand as one of pop punk’s true pioneers. After laying the groundwork for the pop-punk of the 1990s with 1982′s “Milo Goes to College,” Descendents expanded their sound and subject matter for the follow-up, “I Don’t Want to Grow Up.” The standout track “Silly Girl” wasn’t just a breakout moment for the band. It was also a signal that it was okay for punk rock guys to shamelessly sing about girls.\n\n76. Sugarcult - “Bouncing Off the Walls” (2002)\n\nPop punk’s emergence coincided with an increase in raunchy teen-driven comedies (the ones you would sneak into if you weren’t 17) during the late 1990s and early 2000s. That was the case for Sugarcult, whose songs seemed to play in every Tara Reid movie. That included the endlessly catchy “Bouncing Off the Walls,” which was featured in the Ryan Reynolds (and, yes, Tara Reid) led movie “Van Wilder.”\n\n75. Panic! at the Disco - “Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off” (2006)\n\nPanic! at the Disco is the most difficult of the iconic 2000s pop-punk bands to critique on a list like this. The band moved on from the genre fairly quickly. But it kind of doesn’t matter. Panic!’s debut album, “A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out,” is loaded with enough gems to fill pop-punk playlists for years to come. “Lying Is the Most Fun...” is one of the most memorable songs from the album and a standout moment at any live show the band put on.\n\n74. Allister - “Somewhere on Fullerton” (2002)\n\nYou could argue very few pop-punk bands knew how to capture suburban life on record quite like Allister, as evident by the band’s third album “Last Stop Suburbia.” “Somewhere on Fullerton” is the kind of nostalgic song meant to capture a feeling and time you never want to fully let go. It’s a definitive precursor to a song like Yellowcard’s “Ocean Avenue” and one of the key tracks to come from influential label Drive-Thru Records.\n\n73. SR-71 – “Right Now” (2000)\n\nYou know the opening guitar riff to SR-71′s “Right Now.” Trust me, even if you don’t think you do...You. Know. It. If for nothing else than the it scored your favorite video game, commercial or movie trailer (including “Dude, Where’s My Car,” “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle” and “Old School”) in the early 2000s. “Right Now” became a mainstream hit for SR-71, but it wasn’t the only pop-punk anthem the group wrote. Bowling for Soup’s biggest hit “1985″ was a cover of an SR-71 song that failed to take off upon its initial release.\n\n72. MxPx – “Chick Magnet” (1996)\n\nMxPx began its run as a more straightforward punk rock band, drawing influence from artists like The Clash, Sex Pistols and Bad Religion. However, soon enough (and in time for the band’s third album “Life in General”), MxPx was crafting some of the catchiest pop-punk songs of the mid-1990s. “Chick Magnet” was really the first song to start making waves outside of diehard pop-punk circles and it’s easy to see why. Just about every band who could claim pop-punk as a genre in the late 1990s sounded like they’d listened to “Chick Magnet” a dozen times. Who didn’t?\n\n71. Fall Out Boy - “Dance, Dance” (2005)\n\nFew pop-punk songs can rival the catchy bass lines of Green Day’s “Dookie.” But Fall Out Boy’s “Dance, Dance” is one of them. Patrick Stump originally wrote the rhythmic bass line on an acoustic guitar. It hooks you within the first few seconds of the song. It’s no surprise that “Dance, Dance” became one of FOB’s biggest hits and a showcase of pop punk at its peak powers in the mid-2000s.\n\n70. My Chemical Romance - “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” (2004)\n\nYou likely remember where you were the first time you heard My Chemical Romance’s breakthrough “I’m Not Okay” and then again when you saw the amazing video on MTV. Gerard Way’s performance on the verses is enough to give you chills. But it’s his emotional screams on the hook that make you sing along to every single line. The repeat value on “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” is off the charts.\n\n69. Boys Like Girls - “The Great Escape” (2007)\n\nYou could argue that Boys Like Girls’ big moment came in 2009 when the band joined forces with Taylor Swift for the top-20 hit “Two Is Better Than One” (No matter what, these guys can say they did a song with T-Swift). But two years prior, the band had already proven itself capable of crafting an infectious hit. Carried by its massive hook, 2007′s “The Great Escape” became one of the most played pop-punk songs on the radio. It’s hook still rings in your ears 15 years later.\n\n68. New Found Glory - “Hit or Miss” (2000)\n\n“Hit or Miss” was the first song on New Found Glory’s first album. The band had been influenced by everyone from Green Day and Blink-182 to The Get Up Kids and The Promise Ring. But NFG was developing its own blueprint. The group’s playful songs and aggressive riffs would serve as the perfect backdrop for singer Jordan Pundik. Shortly after his vocals arrived on “Hit or Miss,” Pundik became the archetype for the 21st century pop-punk singer.\n\n67. Taking Back Sunday - “MakeDamnSure” (2005)\n\nTaking Back Sunday was always a different kind of band. Its merger of emo and pop-punk went against the origins of the latter which demanded things not be all that serious. And yet, it worked. “MakeDamnSure” stands as a fan favorite because of the song’s conviction with a massive chorus to back it up. Taking Back Sunday was never about restraint and the payoff on a song like “MakeDamnSure” is huge.\n\n66. Mayday Parade - “Jamie All Over” (2007)\n\n“I had a dream last night we. Drove out to see Las Vegas. We lost ourselves in the bright lights...” Pop-punk can be playful and rebellious. But Mayday Parade has always capitalized on listeners’ desire for romance. “Jamie All Over” paints a vivid picture of true love and where it can take you, equipped with one of the best hooks in modern pop-punk.\n\n65. Olivia Rodrigo - “good 4 u” (2021)\n\nIt was only a matter of time until Hayley Williams and Paramore became a chief influence for a new generation of female pop stars. It’s safe to say that Olivia Rodrigo introduced a new generation to pop-punk with her big hit “good 4 u,” which is one of the best “Misery Business” knockoffs (Williams and Josh Farro wound up getting co-writing credits due to the track’s similarity) you’ll ever hear. Rodrigo may not be a “pop-punk artist” but she showed the genre’s modern-day power with this massive hit.\n\n64. Motion City Soundtrack – “Everything Is Alright” (2005)\n\nEven before its guitars kick in, Motion City Soundtrack’s “Everything Is Alright” sounds like a massive pop hit. The band mix of synthesizers, killer guitar riffs and melody made “Everything Is Alright” sound quite different from most pop-punk songs at a time when the format was surging. When a genre goes mainstream, it can fall into complacency. But Motion City Soundtrack was still being inventive.\n\n63. No Use for Name - “Soulmate” (1995)\n\nNo Use for Name was one of the signature acts in the development of the Fat Wreck Chords’ sound, which automatically makes the California band one of the most influential pop-punk acts of all time. No Use for Name’s biggest single “Soulmate” was responsible for putting the label on the map in mainstream circles thanks to solid airplay on MTV. No Use for Name became one of the first true pop-punk bands not named Green Day to make its mark on the channel.\n\n62. Jawbreaker - “Want” (1990)\n\nFor much of the 1980s, punk-rock scenes were split between punk, hardcore, pop-punk and emo. But that all changed with Jawbreaker’s first album. The song “Want” became one of the first memorable examples of all those genres merging to create something you couldn’t get enough of.\n\n61. Bowling for Soup - “Girl All the Bad Guys Want” (2002)\n\nFew pop-punk bands have ever had a run of singles as impressive as Bowling for Soup did from the early-to-mid 2000s. That all starts with ‘Girl All the Bad Guys Want,” one of the catchiest songs from any genre during that era. It was a huge moment for “Bowling for Soup,” saving the band’s career and even earning the Texas pop-punkers a Grammy nomination.\n\n60. We the Kings - “Check Yes Juliet” (2008)\n\nWe the Kings weren’t treading new waters on “Check Yes Juliet.” They were just very smart when capitalizing on pop punk’s boom. “Check Yes Juliet” is a clever play on the greatest love story of all time that comes loaded with heavy guitars and an amazing chorus that still gets the crowd going nearly 15 years after the song first came out.\n\n59. A Day to Remember - “All Signs Point to Lauderdale” (2010)\n\nNo band is better at merging the elements of metalcore and pop-punk than A Day to Remember. Still, 2010′s “What Separates Me from You” and its emphasis on the pop side of things was divisive upon its release. In retrospect, the album shows ADTR at its songwriting peak. The standout and fan favorite “All Signs Point to Lauderdale” is the most pop-savvy thing the band has ever released with lyrics that demand a chant: “I hate this town, it’s so washed up, and all my friends don’t give a f**k...”\n\n58. Less Than Jake - “All My Friends are Metalheads” (2000)\n\nThe 1990s saw several bands merging the elements of ska and pop-punk. It could often be hit or miss. But by the start of the 21st century, Less Than Jake had perfected it on “All My Friends are Metalhead.” One could argue ska-punk peaked in the mid-to-late 1990s. Don’t count LTJ fans among them. Songs like “All MY Friends are Metalheads” and explosive chorus filled the seats on multiple Warped Tours.\n\n57. Bouncing Souls - “True Believers” (2001)\n\nBouncing Souls had been producing stellar, romanticized punk rock since the early 1990s, helping shape the New Jersey scene with its batch of light-hearted tunes. However, it was the band’s pop-punk anthem “True Believers” that finally drew mainstream attention as pop-punk took off. Fans began discovering Bouncing Souls’ back catalog. But Bouncing Soulds remained true to its roots, filming the video for “True Believers” at CBGB in New York.\n\n56. Bad Religion - “Suffer” (1988)\n\nThough Descendents had created the sound that would become modern pop-punk in the early 1980s, the genre didn’t get much attention in the California punk rock scene until Bad Religion, a respected punk and hardcore act, embraced it. That came about on 1998′s “Suffer” when the title track smoothed out the band’s rough sound, giving it the playful charge of pop-punk. Bad Religion may not go down as a “pop-punk” band per se. But its huge impact on the genre was tremendous.\n\n55. Relient K - “Be My Escape” (2004)\n\nCompared to just about any other song on this list, the guitars on “Be My Escape” are quite mild. But there was a certain beauty to Relient K’s sound and how it put emphasis on Matthew Thiessen’s blissful lyrics (“I am a hostage to my own humanity / Self-detained and forced to live in this mess I made”). Relient K wasn’t the hardest pop-punk band around. But they knew how to make you swoon.\n\n54. The Wonder Years – “Came Out Swinging” (2011)\n\nThe Wonder Years’ 2011 album “Suburbia I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing” is part of the trilogy that began with 2010′s “The Upsides.” But the former’s opening track “Came Out Swinging” is the moment where just about everyone realized The Wonder Years were one of, if not the best band in pop-punk.\n\n53. Green Day - “Jesus of Suburbia” (2005)\n\nIt’s probably an exaggeration to say Green Day had been written off by the time the band released 2004′s “American Idiot.” But Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool were a decade removed from the groundbreaking “Dookie.” Virtually every song on “American Idiot” signaled that Green Day was far from done. But “Jesus of Suburbia” was special. The first half of the song is pop-punk gold, before morning into a progressive-rock jam that would serve as a new generation’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.”\n\n52. Something Corporate - “Punk Rock Princess” (2003)\n\nAs the title suggests, “Punk Rock Princess” is a quintessential pop-punk love song. You can certainly give Something Corporate credit for making the piano an integral part of pop-punk. “Punk Rock Princess” is one of the band’s songs that plays it more straightforward rock and roll. But Andrew McMahon knew how to bring in the keys to accent the song’s seductive nature.\n\n51. Blink-182 - “All the Small Things” (2000)\n\nIf “All the Small Things” feels like less of a pop-punk song than Blink-182′s other work, it’s because it marked the first time the genre found itself competing with the biggest pop stars in the world. “All the Small Things” was so catchy, it demanded airplay on pop radio. And its success can’t be separated from the landmark music video that found Blink parodying the very boy bands and pop stars the band was now competing with. Brilliant.\n\n50. My Chemical Romance - “Helena” (2005)\n\nHeartbreak isn’t always about romantic relationships. After My Chemical Romance members, Gerard and Mikey Way’s grandmother passed away the group channeled all the pain into “Helena,” a raw, emotional anthem about loss that would help cement the band as a powerhouse of the emo and pop-punk genres.\n\n49. The Undertones - “Teenage Kicks” (1978)\n\nThree-chord pop-punk can be a thing of beauty when done the right way. And Northern Ireland’s The Undertones were doing it to perfection before just about anyone. To this day, the band’s landmark debut single “Teenage Kicks” feels like the sounds of pop-punk being born with The Undertones taking their pop influences (they began as a band covering pop-rock songs) and merging it with the punk rock sound that was growing in popularity in Europe.\n\n48. Lagwagon - “May 16″ (1998)\n\nAnother one of the key acts from Fat Wreck Chords, Lagwagon held to its punk and skate punk origins during the first part of its career. Then came 1998′s “Let’s Talk About Feelings.” The pop-savvy “May 16″ was a breakthrough for the band, becoming the head-turning standout from the soundtrack to “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2.”\n\n47. Paramore – “Crushcrushcrush” (2007)\n\nLook around these days and the pop-punk band with the most influence on mainstream music isn’t Green Day, Blink-182, Fall Out Boy or All Time Low. It’s Paramore. Why is that? First off, Paramore always felt like something more than pop-punk. “Crushcrushcrush,” the best song from Paramore’s breakthrough “Riot!” is loaded with a big chorus, typical pop-punk riffs and a shameless breakdown. But there’s something sinister to it, courtesy of frontwoman Hayley Williams. She always had more charisma than any pop-punk frontman. “Crushcrushcrush” is a full-on rock song. But it wouldn’t be a stretch to hear Kelly Clarkson or Olivia Rodrigo sing it.\n\n46. Brand New - “Jude Law and a Semester Abroad” (2002)\n\nBrand New would get more progressive on its proceeding releases. But the band was straight-on pop-punk with its 2001 debut “Your Favorite Weapon.” The lead single “Jude Law and a Semester Abroad” is a vengeful takedown by a guy who got dumped that builds from a playful chorus to a thrilling hook.\n\n45. AFI - “Miss Murder” (2006)\n\nThis is the point where hardcore AFI fans roll their eyes and scream the band has better songs than “Miss Murder.” But they shouldn’t. AFI carried the torch for horror punk passed on by Misfits and Alkaline Trio, and “Miss Murder” was its magnum opus. Backed by its memorable bassline and chorus chant, “Miss Murder” would propel AFI to superstar status.\n\n44. The Ataris - “San Dimas High School Rules” (1999)\n\nBefore The Ataris were making mainstream waves with an awesome cover of a Don Henley song, the band was creating the ultimate anthem about longing for the girl of your dreams. The classic “San Dimas High School Rules” contains some of the best lyrics of any fast-paced, pop-punk love song you’ll hear: “I only wish that this could be. Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me. I swear I’d treat you like a queen.” It’s a sentiment that would get echoed time and time again throughout the 2000s.\n\n43. Face to Face - “Disconnected” (1993)\n\nFace to Face never made it big in mainstream circles. But its bandmembers would eventually spread out into other projects such as The Offspring, Saves the Day and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Yet, Face to Face’s legacy isn’t just about what the members did after the fact. The band delivered one radio hit with “Disconnected,” which Los Angeles radio station KROQ ate up. And who could blame them? “Disconnected” boasts one of the best pop-punk choruses of the 1990s and influenced bands who wanted to dabble in melodic riffs while still holding true to their punk roots.\n\n42. Motion City Soundtrack - “The Future Freaks Me Out” (2003)\n\nMotion City’s use of synthesizers set the band apart from other pop-punk acts during the genre’s peak. But there was also a neurotic element to frontman Justin Courtney Pierre’s lyrics that brought a smile to your face. On the fan-favorite “The Future Freaks Me Out,” he wasn’t afraid to admit his insecurities while injecting numerous nuggets of pop culture. There’s a reason it’s a standout at live shows with fans singing every single word.\n\n41. The Mr. T Experience, “Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba” (1996)\n\nThe Mr. T Experience was one of the essential bands that emerged from Lookout! Records in the mid-1990s (alongside Green Day, The Queers and Screeching Weasel). MTX may be the least known of the bunch in mainstream circles. And yet, the band is responsible for the quintessential Lookout! song in the amazing “Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba.” It’s a brilliant expression of everything that defined pop-punk at that time.\n\n40. The All-American Rejects - “Dirty Little Secret” (2005)\n\nThe All-American Rejects felt like everyone’s favorite little underdog with its 2002 self-titled debut album. Then came “Dirty Little Secret,” the lead single from 2005′s “Move Along.” Suddenly they were one of the biggest bands in the world. There was no helping it, considering you’d be hard-pressed to find too many choruses bigger or better than the one of “Dirty Little Secret.”\n\n39. Say Anything - “Alive with the Glory of Love” (2006)\n\nMax Bemis is a strange dude. Where every other band was crafting pop-punk songs around themes like heartbreak and rebellion, Bemis’ Say Anything would unleash its greatest song, “Alive with the Glory of Love,” about Bemis’ grandparents, both of whom were Holocaust survivors. The storytelling is rich and the imagery packs a wallop. Not only is “Alive with the Glory of Love” catchy as heck, but it’s also one of the greatest love stories the genre has ever told.\n\n38. Good Charlotte - “The Anthem” (2003)\n\nGood Charlotte was a sign of just how massive pop-punk had become. The Madden brothers looked like the dudes in a popular rap-rock band. Their punchy hit “The Anthem” even starts like it is going to be a Linkin Park song before quickly turning into a pop-punk rager. Good Charlotte had an edge that other pop-punk bands lacked and on “The Anthem” they just seem cooler and more rebellious than everyone else.\n\n37. The Queers - “Love Love Love” (1990)\n\nIt can be easy to forget where you came from, which is why a band like The Queers was so important. The band’s catchiest song “Love Love Love” from its debut album “Grow Up,” carried the torch of the Ramones, THE pop-punk architects who merged punk rock and bubblegum pop. As you can tell from “Love Love Love,” The Queers were worthy descendants, crafting a love song with a punchy punk mentality.\n\n36. MxPx - “Punk Rawk Show” (1995)\n\nYears before Blink-182 captured the vibes of going to “The Rock Show,” it was MxPx who truly summed up the relatable feeling of heading out to see your favorite band spectacularly: “There’s no use in TV shows, radio, or rodeo. I wanna get into the crowd. I wanna hear it played real loud!” Damn right.\n\n35. Alkaline Trio - “Stupid Kid” (2002)\n\nAlkaline Trio wasn’t your ordinary pop-punk band. The band was rooted in the horror punk of the Misfits. And yet, Matt Skiba and company could do pop-punk with the best of them. The perfect example is “Stupid Kid,” the song from “From Here to Infirmary” that introduced Alkaline Trio to an entirely different audience and cemented Skiba as one of the finest songwriters in the scene.\n\n34. Screeching Weasel - “What We Hate” (1991)\n\nThe things you look for in a great Ben Weasel song include something catchy, nihilistic and lights a fire under your skin. It’s all there in on “Why We Hate” from Screeching Weasel’s 1991 album “My Brain Hurts.” It’s a spark plug of a song that comes with a sense of rebellion and understanding. Its influence on the pop-punk that would go mainstream in the mid-1990s is immeasurable.\n\n33. The Starting Line - “Best of Me” (2003)\n\nThe Starting Line’s signature song starts as a fake-out. An acoustic guitar plays as singer Kenny Vasoli goes into emo mode: “‘Tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone. The worst is over. You can have the best of me...” The song then transforms into full-on pop-punk anthem. “Best of Me” is a hybrid of pop-punk and emo that’s perfect for retrospective late nights on the couch or a trip to the mosh pit.\n\n32. Misfits - “Astro Zombies” (1982)\n\nTo avoid upsetting Misfits fans, we wouldn’t dare call the legendary punk act “pop-punk.” But there’s no denying the band’s influence on the genre, specifically starting with 1982′s “Walk Among Us.” Listen to “Astro Zombies” and you have a blueprint for what would come, blending elements of 1960s pop with the driving punk sound. That mix (along with Misfits’ style) would serve as the primary influence on acts like Alkaline Trio, AFI and My Chemical Romance.\n\n31. Simple Plan - “I’d Do Anything” (2002)\n\nJust like New Found Glory, Canadian rock band Simple Plan found itself laying the blueprint for 21st-century pop-punk with boisterous anthems and nasally vocals on songs like “I’m Just a Kid,” “Addicted” and “Perfect.” But it’s “I’d Do Anything” that’s endured most because of its relatable sentiment about true love: “I’d do anything just to hold you in my arms...” Who wouldn’t melt to that?\n\n30. Pennywise - “Bro Hymn” (1991)\n\nPennywise was one of those credible punk rock bands founded in the late 1980s that made it okay to dabble in pop. The soaring “Bro Hymn” was a somewhat shocking closer on Pennywise’s aggressive debut, incorporating a catchy “whoa” chant found that brought the pop-punk out.\n\n29. All Time Low – “Dear Maria, Count Me In” (2008)\n\nAll Time Low was the face of the next wave of pop-punk bands during the second half of the 2000s. The band even took its name from a New Found Glory song. All Time Low certainly followed the sound bands like Fall Out Boy and Paramore road to fame, but also modernized it a bit. ATL’s finest song, “Dear Maria, Count Me In” is a clear indication as the hook goes beyond pop-punk and is on par with the finest pop songs on the radio during that time.\n\n28. Blink-182 - “Dammit” (1997)\n\nBlink-182 would go on to have bigger hits than “Dammit.” But for many fans, it’s still Blink at its peak. Heck, to this day the band still closes out most of its shows with. That’s because “Dammit” and its signature line “I guess this is growing up” would come to embody the spirit of pop-punk heading into a new millennium where it would become a genre played all over MTV.\n\n27. Fall Out Boy - “Sugar, We’re Goin Down” (2005)\n\nNo song embodies the peak, mainstream run pop-punk had in the mid-2000s more than “Sugar, We’re Goin Down.” To call Fall Out Boy’s anthem catchy would be an understatement. It was so infectious and popular it catapulted the entire pop-punk genre to the pop spotlight. Like most bands that reached such heights, Fall Out Boy would move on from pop punk to bigger rock and roll territory. But nothing the band has done hit quite as hard as “Sugar, WE’re Going Down.”\n\n26. Green Day – “Longview” (1994)\n\nIt seems so long ago that Green Day’s debut single “Longview” arrived. It was 1994 to be exact and it was a game-changer. To the people in the punk scene in Green Day’s native California, the band had sold out. To everyone else in the world, Billie Joe Armstrong and company were introducing us to the contemporary sounds of pop-punk draped around lyrics about masturbation as means of escape. The world would never be the same.\n\n25. Avril Lavigne - “Sk8er Boi” (2002)\n\nAvril Lavigne didn’t start as a pop-punk icon. Her massively popular debut single “Complicated” sounded like something Britney Spears could get down with. But then came “Sk8er Boi” and its powerful and scene-centric hook. The bouncy pop-punk anthem gave Lavigne the punk-cred that allowed her to hang with the boys while standing out among them as the “queen” of pop punk.\n\n24. Taking Back Sunday - “Cute Without the ‘E’” (Cut from the Team)” (2002)\n\nI would classify most Taking Back Sunday songs as emo, through and through. Based on the title alone “Cute Without the ‘E’” is about as emo as it gets. But Taking Back Sunday wasn’t above capitalizing on the surge pop-punk was experiencing at the time. The charging guitars, ballistic drums and soaring hook on “Cute” are pop-punk perfection.\n\n23. NOFX - “Linoleum” (1994)\n\nNOFX often seemed annoyed at the more stereotypical aspects of pop-punk, which allowed the band to carve out its niche in the genre that was rooted in skate punk. Bassist and lead vocalist Fat Mike’s legacy is directly tied to his founding of Fat Wreck Chords. But the accomplishments of NOFX shouldn’t be understated. The band’s in-your-face, aggressive sound that remained true to punk takes center stage on “Linoleum,” a song that would become an integral part of pop punk’s first boom and a major influence on the likes of Sum 41 and Good Charlotte.\n\n22. Lit – “My Own Worst Enemy” (1999)\n\nYou’ll find that many of the catchiest pop-punk songs of the late 1990s built their hooks around power-pop. Lit’s “My Own Worst Enemy” is no exception. Everything else about the song sounds like pop-punk. Yet, that massive hook soars like a power-pop anthem. Lit leans into it. Go to any bar full of Millennials and witness the singalong of your life when “My Own Worst Enemy” comes on to this day.\n\n21. Rancid - “Ruby Soho” (1995)\n\nIf Operation Ivy was a raw, punk-driven band, Rancid (the group its members would go on to form after) found the perfect balance between punk and pop. Tim Armstrong was a heck of a lyric writer who had a knack for melody. “Ruby Soho” doesn’t immediately sound like it should be a hit. But it grows on you about as much as any song on this list thanks to Armstrong’s heartfelt vocals and a singalong chorus the Ramones could be proud of.\n\n20. Saves the Day - “Shoulder the Wheel” (1999)\n\nMore than 20 years on, it’s still impossible to measure the impact Saves the Day’s “Through Being Cool” had on the future of pop-punk and emo, other than to try and count the numerous bands who sound like they formed after listening to “Shoulder the Wheel.” The song’s merger of pop-punk and emo would become the norm for so many bands that would take the stages at Warped Tour in the 2000s.\n\n19. Yellowcard - “Ocean Avenue” (2003)\n\n“Ocean Avenue” is about a time and a place, and its kick of nostalgia was everything back in 2003. Specifically, the song references a place in Jacksonville, Fla. The members of Yellowcard used to hang out before moving to California. But for listeners, Ocean Avenue is a stand-in for that special coming of age moment where you leave the place that made you follow your dreams. It’s the pop-punk “Thunder Road.”\n\n18. Panic! at the Disco - “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” (2006)\n\nIt seems like forever ago Panic! at the Disco sounded like this. Before the band discovered The Beatles on its sophomore album and then singer Brandon Urie took over the creative reins, Panic! was merging elements of pop-punk, baroque pop and alternative music on “I Write Sins Not Tragedies,” one of the biggest pop-punk breakthrough anthems in history. The video would become a mainstay on MTV and earn the group Video of the Year at the 2006 VMAs.\n\n17. Neck Deep – “In Bloom” (2017)\n\nDoing a list like this you come across every kind of pop-punk song. And even going over 45 years of music, I’m not sure a better song in the genre has been written than Neck Deep’s “In Bloom.” Some songs on this list earn points for their influence and impact on the evolution of pop-punk or how popular they were. Neck Deep’s “In Bloom” is just a great, great tune. The 2018 Kerrang! award winner for Best Song has a hook that will give you chills. It’s not just one of the best pop-punk songs of the past 10 years but one of the best tracks in any genre during that period.\n\n16. Jawbreaker - “Chesterfield King” (1994)\n\n“Chesterfield King” is the stuff of legend -- a brilliant showcase in storytelling about a chance encounter with a homeless woman and the cigarette shared. Jawbreaker’s legacy lies in the band serving as a bridge from the hardcore music that ruled over punk in the late 1980s to the more emo-driven songs of the 1990s. You can feel all of that in “Chesterfield King.”\n\n15. No Doubt – “Just A Girl” (1995)\n\nGwen Stefani got so big it’s hard to remember when she was, well, just a girl breaking boundaries in punk music. When No Doubt hit the mainstream, the ska-punk band had toyed around with a different sound. But realizing Gwen needed to be at the forefront was key. Women had been in punk rock since the 1980s. But No Doubt’s pop-punk anthem “Just a Girl” and its mainstream appeal gave women a seat at the table as the genre was taking off, paving the way for Avril Lavigne, Paramore and so many more.\n\n14. My Chemical Romance - “Welcome to the Black Parade” (2006)\n\nGreen Day’s “American Idiot” came out two years before My Chemical Romance’s” “The Black Parade,” technically giving pop-punk its first rock opera. But Green Day was so big at that point, the band might as well have been The Who. Thus, when MCR’s “Welcome to the Black Parade” was unleashed as a single, its impact was profound. The track’s emo-drenched first half knocks you off your feet before the pop-punk guitars and drums ring in. “The Black Parade” sent shockwaves through the genre, pushing the boundaries of what pop-punk acts could do.\n\n13. Descendents – “Suburban Home” (1982)\n\n“I want to be stereotyped, I want to be classified...” As you’ve probably heard before, Descendents created the blueprint for modern pop-punk with their 1982 debut album “Milo Goes to College.” And it’s all about youthful frustration. Descendents gave hardcore punk a more melodic sound on songs that too simple topics and made them seem profound and urgent. The sarcasm on “Suburban Home” is biting. But it’s also relatable. Go ahead and leave your band to become the thing you’ve rebelled against. Better yet, sing about it.\n\n12. New Found Glory - “My Friends Over You” (2002)\n\nNew Found Glory had already built a solid fanbase with its 2000 debut. But when “My Friends Over You,” the lead single from 2002′s “Sticks and Stones” hit, the band became a true sensation. The record sales may not have matched. But walking the halls of high school at the time, you’d find just as many New Found Glory fans as that of Nickelback, Nelly or Eminem. The impact on the pop-punk genre was huge. “My Friends Over You” made it so you had to be more than just a talented pop-punk band. You needed the show-stopping anthem to back it up.\n\n11. Bad Religion - “American Jesus” (1993)\n\nA political spark plug of a song, Bad Religion’s “American Jesus” held to the band’s punk and hardcore roots while also featuring a catchy pop-punk sound that would earn the video airplay on MTV. The song was the first single from “Recipe for Hate” and marked Bad Religion’s move to Atlantic Records, which marked a huge moment for pop punk’s ascension to major labels, setting the stage for bands like Green Day and The Offspring to sell millions of records a few years later.\n\n10. Buzzcocks - “Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)” (1978)\n\nBuzzcocks are unquestionably one of the forefathers of pop-punk. The band all but invented it on 1977′s “Another Music in a Different Kitchen” before perfecting it with its follow-up, “Love Bites,” a year later. “Ever Fallen in Love” is such an important track. If other bands had beat Buzzcocks to the pop-punk punch, the British band certainly showed everyone how a love song should be crafted in the genre.\n\n9. Fall Out Boy - “Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy” (2003)\n\nIn 2003, a band from Wilmette, Ill. released a lo-fi collection of simple pop-punk songs that barely charted. That band, named after a character on “The Simpsons,” would eventually become the biggest pop-punk band in the world. Clearly, a generation of pop-punk artists was paying attention. Fall Out Boy’s second single “Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy” is the blueprint for everything that would come after, including FOB’s 2005 major label breakthrough “From Under the Cork Tree.” And to this day, you don’t hear younger bands trying to emulate “Sugar, We’re Going Down.” Nope. They go back to the roots of great pop-punk songwriting and the infectious love songs perfected in the early 2000s.\n\n8. The Offspring - “Self Esteem” (1994)\n\nGreen Day’s “Dookie” gets a lot of credit for pop punk’s mainstream surge in the mid-1990s. But The Offspring’s fellow 1994 album “Smash” was just a monster if not bigger, becoming the biggest album ever released by an independent record label at that time. The lead single “Come Out Play” was the precise pop-punk jab. But “Self Esteem” and those opening chants were the knockout punch. The track holds true to the concept of punk rock getting a catchy facelift. “Self Esteem” was pop punk’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” merging two genres – pop-punk and grunge – that would come to define 1990s alternative rock.\n\n7. Sum 41 - “Fat Lip” (2001)\n\nFew things...Check that. NOTHING in the history of pop-punk is more recognizable and more likely to insight a mosh pit than the opening guitar riff on Sum 41′s “Fat Lip.” It’s that good. And when it comes to pop-punk hooks, it gets no bigger and better than “I don’t wanna waste my time...” Two decades after its release and “Fat Lip” is still the ultimate pop-punk party starter. When it comes to 21st-century pop-punk songs, you won’t find one more enduring than this.\n\n6. Operation Ivy - “Knowledge” (1989)\n\nA lot of attention is paid to how the punk rock of the Ramones was turned into pop-punk. But Operation Ivy presented a different bridge, taking ska and punk, and essentially the sound of The Clash, and bringing it into pop-punk, which was just as important. Operation Ivy was only together for three years. Yet, every pop-punk band has a favorite Operation Ivy song and for many (probably most) it’s “Knowledge.” Like most Operation Ivy songs, its rough edges don’t immediately scream pop-punk. But once the guitars take hold, you hear all you need to hear. And odds are you’ve heard the chorus “All I know is that I don’t know. All I know is that I don’t know nothing” uttered before even if it wasn’t from Operation Ivy, considering the song has been covered by so many pop-punk artists.\n\n5. Ramones - “Blitzkrieg Bop” (1976)\n\nMost historians will agree, pop-punk begins with Ramones’ self-titled debut album. You can argue all day about which songs are punk or pop-punk. But there’s no dispute when it comes to “Blitzkrieg Bop.” The track’s charging guitars, pop sensibilities and unforgettable chant all come together for a historic moment where pop and punk fully merged. When it comes to historical impact, no song on this list even comes close.\n\n4. Jimmy Eat World - “The Middle” (2001)\n\nGreen Day and Blink-182 were already doing their things when Jimmy Eat World arrived. But the former two bands were still snot-nosed punks to most of the mainstream public. Jimmy Eat World was something different -- an emo band that blended in perfectly with alternative rock. The members looked like the guys you met in college and, more importantly, the type of bands that got played on Top 40 radio. That’s what made Jimmy Eat World’s foray into pop punk, “The Middle,” so important. Pop-punk may have already been a force among America’s youth. But “The Middle” truly brought it to the masses at the start of the 21st century.\n\n3. Paramore - “Misery Business” (2007)\n\nWhat to do with a problematic song that the songwriter herself has all written off. If it were up to Paramore’s Hayley Williams, “Misery Business” would be removed from playlists (and probably this list) as she regrets it as a form of slut-shaming. However, it’s hard for anyone to ignore what may be the biggest bop in pop-punk history and one of the genre’s most influential songs. “Misery Business” was a force of nature at pop punk’s peak that has been covered to death, inspiring legions of bands that mimicked Paramore’s style and Williams’ swagger. Its sentiment might be regrettable, but its impact was profound.\n\n2. Blink-182 - “What’s My Age Again?” (1999)\n\nThe idea of grown men writing about immature antics and self-loathing is weird. But rather than pretend its not, Blink-182 leaned into it on “What’s My Age Again?,” the song that would propel pop-punk into a new century. What was pop-punk before the members of Blink-182 were running naked down the street on MTV? Honestly, it’s hard to remember. Pop-punk was a genre long before Blink-182 became popular. But “What’s My Age Again?” signified the genre becoming a force in pop culture.\n\n1. Green Day - “Basket Case” (1994)"
