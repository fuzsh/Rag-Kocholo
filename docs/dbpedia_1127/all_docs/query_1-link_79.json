        "text": "Last weekend, country fans descended upon the Soo Pass Ranch in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota for another year of WE Fest, one of the premiere country music festivals in the region.\n\nThe headliners for WE Fest this year were Jelly Roll, Park McCollum, and Eric Church, with each day providing a nice variety of country music stars.\n\nI spoke to friends who attended the event and despite some storms early on, all said they enjoyed the weekend and there was debate over who was the best performer, with most choosing either Jelly Roll on Thursday night, or Eric Church on Saturday.\n\nHowever, everyone was talking about what went down Friday during the Carly Pearce performance.\n\nCarly Pearce Gets Feisty On August 2 In Minnesota\n\nCarly was scheduled to appear at 8:15 p.m., just after Trace Adkins and ahead of Parker McCollum, giving her the chance to sing her hits and her new single \"Truck On Fire\", which I've mentioned on the air is a song that has her feeling feisty.\n\nThe song is about a scorned woman who gets revenge by setting her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend's truck on fire. In the song, she sings \"Liar, liar, truck on fire, flames rolling off of your Goodyear tires. Burn, burn, you're gonna learn, never should've put your lips on her.\"\n\nCarly's feisty spirit was with her in full force at WE Fest, which a man who heckled her found out. While she didn't set his truck on fire, she did get him kicked out.\n\nWhile I wasn't there, from what I've heard from others was that Carly began to open up to the crowd to talk about her personal life, when the man yelled something along the lines of \"We don't care!\" That turned out to be a big mistake.\n\nCarly took exception to the comment and yelled \"If you're gonna be an a--hole, then you're gonna have to say it to me and get the f--k out of my show.\"\n\nShe then had the man removed while adding, \"I do not have time for di--s. See ya later!\" You can see the tense moment in the NSFW video below.\n\nBased on social media comments, some observers thought that she should've just ignored the guy and that she overreacted, most seem to be in full support of Carly Pearce and how she handled herself in the moment. What do you think?\n\nSEE NOW: Amazing $2.3 Million Lake Property Now Available In Duluth\n\nMinnesotans will have another chance to see Carly next year as she brings her Hummingbird Tour to Treasure Island Resort & Casino in March."
