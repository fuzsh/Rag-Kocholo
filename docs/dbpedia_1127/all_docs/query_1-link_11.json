        "text": "Post by ~ / % ? * on\n\nGot my copy of the e.p. through my cousin Pedar, who kept going on on and on about them having seen them locally.\n\nSept 2, 1978\n\nIt may be one of the most cherished recordings ever, but the story behind the release of The Undertones’ Teenage Kicks in 1978 is long on happy accidents. Derry’s only punk band didn’t originally plan it to be the lead track on their debut EP (a record that itself was intended solely as an epitaph) and they even had to persuade their singer to rejoin the band just to do the recording. But when DJ John Peel got to hear it, everything went a bit mad. Not that it turned the heads of our heroes. Famously ambivalent to rock-star behaviour and the trappings of fashion – “You wore what your ma bought you back then” – they would be together for a brief but fertile four-album, five-year career.\n\nThey weren’t always popular. If you inspect the back cover of Teenage Kicks you’ll find a photo of some arcane Derry graffiti: ‘Undertones – shit, pish, counts, wankers’.\n\nwww.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-teenage-kicks-by-the-undertones-1\n\nTeenage Kicks\n\nSmarter Than U\n\nTrue Confessions\n\nEmergency Cases\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIt’s a bit boring. The Peel thing became tedious after a while.\n\nBless’em though. Enthusiasm regains them a point or two.\n\nYeah I kind of agree, the riff isn't as durable as other classic garage or punk tracks. I still love their other tracks of the era though."
