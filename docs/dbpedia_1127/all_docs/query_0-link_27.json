I’m nowhere near triple digits, and this project is both rewarding and intimidating, equally. As a self described “Music Nerd”, I’m starting to realize that I’m more nerd and less knowledgeable. If you asked me to guess how many of these 1001 albums that I would know before buying this damn book, I’d confidently guess at least sixty percent. What a fool I was 18 days ago. Todays selection is the debut and self titled album from a Punk Rock slash Pop group called the Undertones. This is a great album to put on while you have a shower beer or two. It is fast paced, it’s uplifting, and the simple lyrics about girls and doing hood rat shit with your friends is enough to set the mood. Honestly though, Undertones debut album is largely forgettable. I can’t really explain it, I love these songs when they’re playing, but as soon as they’re over, I barely remember them. Bands like The Ramones sound very similar and are from the same era, yet had more lasting impressions with their compositions. I’m sure many bands took note of this band and built their craft on top of The Undertones established foundation in music, like, say, Green Day or maybe even Soundgarden. I appreciate this album, it is fun and youthful, it sounds great, it just didn’t leave a lasting impression on me. I’m sure it left enough of a lasting impression on other artists to follow their lead. Please feel free to share your thoughts, opinions and memories!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\n16 tracks? I don’t want the deluxe version, I thought. But wait! This is the original version! This will take ages to listen to. But wait again! The album clocks in at a concise 35 minutes! Now that’s an album that breaks down the door, pushes you about for a bit and then gets the hell out of there! Punky, prickly, full of teenage hormones (Teenage Kicks a perfect pop song?), high energy, a really enjoyable album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nSo-called pop punk was a necessary tweak to keep punk going. You can only make angry, face spitting music for so long. The mid 70s recession had gone and by 1979 Thatcher was Prime Minister and the weary Sex Pistols fans stopped hitting the streets to burn shit and started to pop pills instead. The time was right for pop punk! This sub-genre of punk is probably the one I know best. A lot of my favourite bands like The Police, The Jam, The Pretenders, Joe Jackson were part of this and were getting traction in 1979. The Clash had been around for the angry years but they were getting more traction than ever as they embraced pop punk. I like the Undertones and the genre but the bands I note above will get the 4s and 5s. The Undertones are a few floors below.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nHoly hell 16 tracks and 34 minutes! I take longer pisses than some of these songs. Some pretty similar sounding pop punk songs to me. Nothing special or crazy to me though. Heard better punk.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nThe Undertones? More like the Underwhelmings. Straight forward early British punk but basically the same song 16 times on one album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nI was running late for my eldest daughter's parents evening a few years ago and didn't have time to change, so was wearing football shorts. As her geography teacher was talking some shit about how well she was doing, I felt a twinge in my stomach. I knew I was in trouble, but tried to stay composed. I'm sat there like \"yeah, yeah, she knows all the capital cities of europe because of her years of child trafficking.\" We all laughed...but then, just as I was standing up to leave, my explosive diahorrea kicked in and launched a splurge of hearty brown liquid, splashing it all across a map of Africa. We all laughed. The Undertones were on in the car on the way home.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nListening to this album made me imagine my Dad careering around the streets of suburbia in his Vauxhall Viva modified with twin carbs; me in the back seat barely secured to the hot, faux leather vinyl that passed as a bench seat, him with his brown Aviators, 'tash, flared trousers and mop of hair blowing in the wind. Then I remembered he was more into Meat Loaf at the time and the daydream was shattered. Although lyrically, teenage kicks is still relevant today and the album as a whole was not unenjoyable if a little repetitive towards the end, I think this will end up forgotton, like a rusting car with Teenage Kicks as the singular component rescued and remembered in a museum of classics.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nvery enjoyable. norn iron doing a good.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\ni'm smarter than you\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOk, I consider myself a bit of a New Wave/Punk aficionado and I knew NOTHING about this group. Never heard of them. BLOWN. AWAY. This is what I love about this list. This. So obsessed.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nBut of a wild album. Sounds like if the Dead Kennedy's made an album in the style of Rocky Horror Picture Show. And I've got absolutely no complaints. Big thumbs up from this guy.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nupbeat energetic old school punk. nice and melodic. its short enough so as not to get repetitive. really good album\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIncredibly punchy proto pop punk. This is concise, lean, and full of fun.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nSometimes the lyrics are a little problematic but overall I really like the album. High energy, I like the backup vocals being quite present, good performance, no lazy band members, singer is decent. Quantity over quality is a little issue, with most of the music being pretty simplistic, but does a great job as punk rock music. Does have a bit of variety but they mostly stick to fast-paced jams. Want to see their later stuff as apparently they change their style up.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nOne of the earliest pop-punk records, and it goes hard! The hooks are catchy with lots of energy, while still staying true to it's punk roots. Much less far removed than later pop-punk records, but all music evolves in some way. With all the songs on here, some of them don't stand too well, but the general tone of the record supports the lesser songs by keeping things moving.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThis is a new band for me. Although not usually my style, The Undertones have produced a fairly decent album. It is an upbeat, simple and enjoyable album. With so many songs on the album, however, towards the end, they become a bit muddled and you kind of forget that they are separate songs. A good album but sadly I feel a forgettable one too.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nI don’t know if it’s writers block, but I’ve started, stopped and restarted writing this review at least three times. I’ve tried a few different approaches so far, but, really, it just boils down to this: This is my type of punk. Give me a record like this over anything by the Clash or Pistols any day of the week.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nJohn Peel's wet dream. I could only just about muster a semi.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nFeargal Sharkey has such a great voice, and a great name for a rock star. The lyrics make you ask \"Wow how young are these guys?\" The songs are kind of throw-away, yet more complex and melodic that the 2-minute ditties we've received by American hardcore bans, with a few hit worthy like Teenage Kicks and Jimmy Jimmy.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nMeh, I guess you had to have been there.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nOut of all of the British punk albums we have listened to that was definitely one of them.

Легко могу представить его в саундтреке Тони Хоука, хотя он, вероятно, там уже есть. Очень классные песни, сразу хочется и танцевать и подпевать. И тут есть тинейдж кикс!!!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nNever heard of this band before. Catchy… really fun! Favorite track: Get Over You. But I enjoyed the whole album. This sounds more modern to me than 1979. Lots of little musical surprises scattered throughout. Love the lead singer’s vocals. Definitely adding this to my library!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic, crisp and snappy punk tunes with witty lyrics.

An amazing band I’ve never heard of, becoming something I want to listen to repeatedly\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLet's go baby. The drums on Family Entertainment is the big hook. A collection of grooving, uptempo old school Brit punk.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIt was fun\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOh, every different flavour of yes! So this is a brilliant album. Northern Irish. Equally angry as joyful. An almost perfect rock album. The only criticism I could level at it is that it doesn't include \"It's going to happen\".\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI really enjoyed this one!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI've only been doing this for a few days and this is the first album I've heard that made me say, \"Holy shit, how did I not know about this band?\" \"Teenage Kicks\" is a great song but this album is full of catchy hooks and fun, upbeat pop punk that will make you thing of The Clash, The Ramones, and Dead Kennedys. I love it, and I will definitely be adding The Undertones to my library.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThrow the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Clash into a blender, add a dash of Bryan Ferry's vibrato, then blend away, and I'm pretty sure the resulting concoction will be the Undertones. I don't know how this is the first time I've run across them, as this album is fantastic. This is top-notch old school punk*, and the last time I was this excited about a new (to me) band was when Roxy Music's debut album popped up a few weeks ago. I found a 26-track version of the album on YouTube, and there's a lot to love here. It starts off strong with \"Family Entertainment,\" and while \"The Girls Don't Like It,\" I sure do. \"Teenage Kicks,\" \"Get Over You,\" \"Listening in,\" \"Emergency Cases\" ... So many good tracks. And a special shout-out to \"Mars Bars,\" which is quite funny. Honestly, 26 tracks and I had no desire to skip any of them. That's the dream right there. *Except for \"True Confessions,\" which starts with the line \"Don't look so surprised,\" which amused me because it *was* a surprise, and came out of left field with a Devo-like new wave flavor that caught me completely off guard.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nepic, a must own.. 5 stars is not enough.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nDang I liked this album. I hadn’t heard of them. After finishing the album I listened to it again and then looked at their other stuff. Kind of a rocking poppy punky style that was light and fun.

This has quite a few solid hits and one of the greatest songs of all time (Teenage Kicks). Although I prefer the later albums this is where it began and even the cover is a bold statement. Simply one of the best.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nYes one of the crown jewels of punk pop. Very little to add to this which is an album I originally got on a cheap portugese grey import market vinyl and has been a joy ever since. While Teenage Kicks might not be the best song ever (in that vein I would go for Another Girl, Another Planet by The Only Ones) it is definitely top ten.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n9/10 simple, but that’s the way fun, punky brit-pop goes\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFinally a song for me, Jimmy Jimmy.

Peel was right about Teenage kicks, remains one of the most perfect songs of all time.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nJ'ai le CD, j'ai souvent écouté Teenage Kicks, mais je n'avais jamais été beaucoup plus loin et c'est pourtant un album très cool. Quelque part entre la pop et le punk, assez The Strokes alors qu'ils étaient à peine nés. 16 titres pour 35 minutes pied au plancher. Des riffs de guitares qui s'entrecroise, une voix assez unique et écorchée. Validé !\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic punk rock with a lot of energy. Liked it quite a lot.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWhat a brilliant album, thoroughly enjoyed listening to it\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis was really fun. It reminded me of 90s pop punk.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAn important album in both punk history and Irish music history. Teenage kicks is one of the most flawless pop punk songs ever written and the rest of the album is just as strong!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFun pop-punk from back in the day. This is how it's done, Green Day!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nslay\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic punk rock record. The difference between this album and The Buzzcocks is that The Undertones seem to be having fun and have zero pretension in their view of the world. Not sure there's a single bad track on this record.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nDoes it deserve the 5 stars I’m going to give it? Maybe not quite. It’s a solid 4.5 but I’m a sucker for punk and pop-punk so it gets bumped up.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nA straight forward 70s punk album. Enjoyable. Five stars because it was refreshing after the last album i listened to.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFun music and lyrics!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nPunky with a definite rock and roll influence, I only knew a couple of tracks but had to give this a second listen.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWas really good as well, kinda reminds me of those old high school movies 5/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nTeenage Kicks! What a damn classic. Love this whole record. The blueprint for teenage angst punk rock.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nNever heard of this band before today and I regret it. This is a really fun album and I will be adding this to the list of albums I will listen to. What I love about this project is finding new bands such as this.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nTracklist: \"Family Entertainment\" \"Girls Don't Like It\" \"Male Model\" \"I Gotta Getta\" \"Teenage Kicks\" \"Wrong Way\" \"Jump Boys\" \"Here Comes the Summer\" \"Get Over You\" \"Billy's Third\" \"Jimmy Jimmy\" \"True Confessions\" Musical Style and Production: \"The Undertones\" is known for its raw, unpolished, and stripped-down punk sound. The album was produced by Roger Bechirian, who did an excellent job of capturing the band's frenetic energy. The music is characterized by fast tempos, simple but infectious guitar riffs, and John O'Neill's distinctive, melodic guitar work. The simplicity of the instrumentation is a testament to the band's DIY ethos and their ability to make something great with limited resources. Lyrics and Themes: The Undertones' lyrics often revolve around the themes of adolescent angst, the frustrations of youth, and the awkwardness of teenage romance. \"Teenage Kicks,\" one of the album's standout tracks, is a perfect example of this, with its infectious refrain, \"Teenage dreams, so hard to beat.\" Other tracks like \"Get Over You\" and \"Male Model\" reflect the band's humorous and sometimes sardonic take on these themes. Standout Tracks: \"Teenage Kicks\": A timeless punk anthem, the song's simple but unforgettable melody and relatable lyrics have made it an enduring classic. \"Get Over You\": This track is another highlight, featuring a catchy chorus and an infectious, punky energy. \"Jimmy Jimmy\": Known for its upbeat tempo and clever lyrics, it's another fan favorite. \"Here Comes the Summer\": A contrast to the typical punk sound, this song exudes a carefree, summery vibe. Impact and Legacy: \"The Undertones\" had a significant influence on the punk and new wave movements. \"Teenage Kicks\" is often regarded as one of the greatest punk rock singles ever recorded. The Undertones' knack for writing infectious pop-punk melodies with punk sensibilities helped shape the genre's evolution. The album is a blueprint for countless bands that followed. Overall Evaluation: \"The Undertones\" is a classic punk album that has stood the test of time. It's a concise and energetic collection of songs that perfectly captures the spirit of youth and rebellion. While it may not be the most groundbreaking or experimental punk album, its simple and effective approach to songwriting and performance is its strength. The Undertones' debut remains a must-listen for anyone interested in the punk and new wave genres, offering an engaging snapshot of the late 1970s music scene. In summary, \"The Undertones\" is a landmark album that showcases the band's ability to craft memorable pop-punk tunes with an irreverent edge. It's an essential addition to any punk or new wave music collection and a testament to the enduring power of youthful energy and rebellion in music.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFour stars for Teenage Kicks alone. Plus one for Jimmy Jimmy. The rest is a bonus. But WHAT a bonus. You can see where Supergrass lifted their best ideas from.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis band (and Buzzcocks) convinced me to persevere with punk. I realised it could be fun and playful and smart, and didn't always have to be so serious. There is a bit of filler here (Billy's Third, for example) and I have heard Teenage Kicks too many times to even know if I actually like it any more, but any album that has Here Comes The Summer, Get Over You and Jimmy Jimmy on it has to get 5 stars.

Get over you (el segundo single del disco), True confessions o Listening in, también. Teenage kicks, Jimmy Jimmy y Here comes the summer son las más conocidas y brillantes pero el resto conforman un debut histórico. Male model presenta unos coros que resuenan a lo mismo que los Ramones: el pop de los 60. Los mismo sucede con I gotta getta con ese órgano surfero. También es evidente la influencia de The Buzzcocks (otro grupo fundamental). Wrong way podría ser un temazo de los B-52´s. Canciones de apenas dos minutos, ritmos y construcciones sencillas pero con un gran sentido melódico. Todas son tarareables y disfrutables. Pero todo se minimiza cuando llega una de las mejores canciones de la historia: Teenage kicks. No está en absoluto nada mal para una banda que empezó alrededor de 1975, pero tardó tres años en grabar porque tenían que aprender a escribir y a tocar la guitarra...
