        "text": "In this edition of The Out Door, we explore the idea of music connected by something other than genre, and talk to three artists who have carved out categories of their own through their many projects and endeavors: Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist Steven R. Smith, Dublin-born guitarist Cian Nugent, and New Orleans-residing cellist and singer Leyla McCalla. (Follow The Out Door on Twitter and Tumblr for all types of experimental music news and information.)\n\nI: Genres of One\n\nEva Van Deuran, aka Orphan Fairytale\n\nThere are so many musical categories, even the biggest genre-head would likely admit it’s easy to tire of them all. Recently NPR’s Bob Boilen posited an alternative: “Can you imagine a world where we describe music more for its emotional context than its origin or instrumentation?”\n\nIn practical terms, I think Boilen’s proposition isn’t feasible, since it would make something that is already pretty subjective hopelessly so. It’s hard enough to say what jazz is, but at least you can point to somewhat objective elements like song structure or approach to tempo. Replace that with immeasurable “emotional context” and genres would only mean something to the person describing them.\n\nPersonally, though, I like Boilen’s idea, because I often find myself having a similar response to disparate music. Often it’s simply that I’m reminded of one record when I hear another, because of the state both put me in. To figure out how and why that happens would require solving something far more complex, like the problem of consciousness. Still, it’s fun to contemplate these intuitive groupings, and think about what glues music in brains beyond stylistic cues.\n\nLately, some new records have aligned for me this way, and though no one thing connects them all, I can think of a few commonalities: many are long-form and free-form; sound open to any noises that may come along; mix the abstract and concrete such that no single meaning is clear, but many are suggested; dip in and out of rhythm at will; and conjure vivid images in my head as I listen.\n\nThe first record that sent me down this blurry path is Shareek Hayaat, the latest LP from the duo Safiyya. It’s a collaboration between Brad Rose of the North Sea/Charlatan (and the stellar Digitalis label) and Pat Murano, longtime member of No-Neck Blues Band who records solo as Decimus. It’s a varied record, but its two side-long tracks melt into each other so naturally, the diversity is almost invisible. It’s more like the duo is telling a complex story and need lots of ways to build sets and structure scenes without ever losing the plot. As drones drift around and shards of beat pass by, Shareek Hayat conveys an overwhelming sense of openness—of sound as an infinite space-field to fly around in.\n\nMike Bullock\n\nI hear similar openness in Boston sound artist Mike Bullock's Figures Without Ground. Its two 20-minute pieces are more minimal and distant, at times seemingly content with a single tone. Yet Bullock still sounds ready to take on anything, equally capable of receding into the horizon or blasting noise toward he sky. Baltimore-based Max Eilbacher evokes a similar stretched-out feeling with a more electronic, synthy pallete on his full-length debut Red Anxiety Tracers. He sometimes even bleeds into New Age ambience, but periodically cuts his clouds with lightning-like bursts.\n\nThe Danish duo Age Coin create their expanding sonic universe on Perceptions with the big bang of throbbing beats, albeit ones wrapped in echo and sonic debris. It’s a single-minded sound, hurtling through two 14-minute tracks with stubborn insistence on rhythmic regularity, yet somehow still creating the feeling that anything could happen. Perceptions is out on Alter Stock, the label run by Luke Younger of Helm, whose new EP The Hollow Organ also has a deep-space vibe, but a sharper one. At times Younger’s morphing tracks are so high-resolution you can feel the sounds shooting in one ear and out the other. His way of intimating drone and noise without locking into either reminds me of Greek collagist Jar Moff. His latest LP, Financial Glam, is a masterpiece of tonal shifts; one moment he seems ready to punch you with sound, and just as you’re flinching, suddenly he’s the one dodging and feinting, retreating into a dark distance.\n\nSpeaking of distance, few commit to it the way Belgium dream-conjurer Eva Van Deuren, aka Orphan Fairytale, does. Her new double LP*,* My Favorite Fairytale, apparently reworks some material previously released in smaller editions. But whatever the source, Van Deuren’s ability to bathe all types of sounds—repetitive chords, rippling oscillations, thumb-piano loops—in an enticing haze makes her music feel eternal. Technically you could call her sound lo-fi, but I like to think of it more as closed-eye, the sonic equivalent of the ghostly images that stick to the back of your lids after they droop shut.\n\nBrian Pyle aka Ensemble Economique\n\nUltimately, the winding path I’m mapping through all these excellent records may be an illusion. Perhaps all that connects them is that I like them; maybe each is a genre of one. If so, that would explain why my favorites in the bunch come from Brian Pyle, aka Ensemble Economique. Prolific and constantly searching, he’s rapidly becoming a category of his own, as each release builds on his past and adds something to his future. The three-song (no-thing-ness) EP actually echoes his 2010 masterwork Psychical in its heavy beats and cinemascope tones, but there’s a new level of communication here, especially on “Dream Homes”, which manages to turn a drum-bass loop into a mountain climb.\n\nA more recent full-length, Light That Comes, Light That Vanishes, is perhaps the most upfront, legible Ensemble Economique effort so far. Yet I can’t quite pin down exactly what it’s doing no matter how many layers I peel. By the end, it actually morphs into techno-pop with female voices and a melodies that echoes, of all things, Spandau Ballet. But by then I’m so entranced by Light that Comes, Light That Vanishes that even familiar sounds are perplexing. Maybe that’s what Pyle and the rest of the artists I’ve been enthralled by lately have in common: They each transform sound into their own worlds, and if you hang around long enough, you’ll feel like you live there too. —Marc Masters\n\nNext: The split personality of Steven R. Smith\n\nII: Steven R. Smith: Split Personality\n\n__\n\n__\n\n“It’s just fun to come up with new names and new artwork and a new aesthetic,” says Steven R. Smith, explaining why he’s adopted so many monikers for his music. “It’s like a new window that I can approach in a different way and not feel like I’m betraying this other thing that I’ve worked hard at.”\n\nTo date, Smith has worked under five different names: Hala Strana, Ulaan Khol, Ulaan Markhor, Ulaan Passerine, and simply Steven R. Smith. The sound of each is identifiable, yet they overlap enough that if you’re drawn to one, you’ll find something to like in all of them. They’re all primarily instrumental—most center on Smith’s guitar—and they all bear his unique combination of abstract soundscapes and cinematic songcraft.\n\nIf the lines between these projects are a bit blurry, that’s fine with Smith. He’s not out to reinvent himself with each one, just to stretch in new directions. “Someone could argue that this all could have come out under my own name, but it’s fun to have it all over the place,” he says with a laugh. “It’s confusing, but I’m not worried about hurting the brand. Fuck the brand! We’re having fun here.”\n\nSmith’s latest way of fucking with the brand is his new double LP Ending/Returning, a “split” release in which he plays the same seven pieces twice, once as himself and once as Ulaan Khol. The Steven R. Smith disc is gentler and more distant, accented with piano—an instrument Smith has rarely included on record—and deliberate string work. Ulaan Khol’s sides offer thicker, amp-driven textures, at times recalling Neil Young’s Dead Man soundtrack. But both have a contemplative sense of loss, desolation, and—eventually, on the bright closer “The Known World”—celebration.\n\nOn paper, Ending/Returning sounds pretty conceptual, but in reality it grew, like all of Smith’s records, out of spontaneous experimentation. When he first made a few pieces under both guises, he assumed he’d eventually settle on one or the other. “But then I got attached to both versions and thought, 'This is kind of interesting,'” he recalls.\n\n“To be honest, most of the time, I don’t really know what I’m doing, I’m just trying things,” he continues. “My goal is to create a situation where accidents can happen—hopefully good accidents. There’s never perfection; I’m not looking for that. I’m just looking to get something that I didn’t expect. Because then hopefully people listening will hear something that they weren’t expecting. ”\n\nWhich means improvisation is a huge part of Smith’s process, even in songs that end up sounding pre-written. Often, he'll start a piece thinking about a few things he wants to do, but not knowing how he’ll connect those parts. “If everything’s written, it’s not so much fun to record it,” he insists. “If you already have this thing in your head of what it’s supposed to be, then you’re just setting yourself up for frustration—‘It’s not what I’m hearing in my head!’”\n\nSmith as Ulaan Markhor\n\nSmith’s preference for the unplanned goes back to his earliest musical experiences. During high school in Fullerton, California, he recalls frustrating bandmates by taking liberties with their songs. At the same time he met Glenn Donaldson, who shared his love of musical spontaneity. The two ended up in San Francisco, where they formed Thuja with fellow Fullerton classmate Rob Reger and sound artist Loren Chasse.\n\n“We came out of punk rock, and when we were in college, math rock was in,” he recalls. “We had a band in college that did that, but eventually we got tired of it—that whole playing songs in crazy, regimented time signatures. Once we got to San Francisco we thought, enough of that, let’s loosen up.\" Thuja were so open to experimentation that they became known for using non-traditional instruments and even non-musical objects like branches and rocks. They also became one of the central bands in the Jewelled Antler Collective, started by Donaldson and Chasse and also including The Skygreen Leopards, The Blithe Sons, and Ov.\n\nSmith moved to LA in 2000, only a year after Jewelled Antler began, but he still feels its effects. “I basically learned how to play music with those guys,” he says. “I learned a lot from Loren. The way he would coax sound out of the craziest objects really opened up things a lot, and I’m sure all of that still has play in my music.” Though Thuja is essentially finished, Smith still talks to his compatriots regularly. “I just saw Glenn last week, and we still pass music back and forth, trading ideas,” he says. “The influence is still happening.”\n\nSmith's homemade spike fiddle\n\nPerhaps the most concrete sign of Jewelled-Antler’s influence is Smith’s habit of making his own instruments. “It’s mostly out of necessity,” he says of the hurdy gurdies, violins, and guitars he’s built. “I can’t afford some instruments, and if you hear these colors in your head, you have to get them from somewhere.” He’s built a xylophone with spoons and a spike fiddle out of a gourd. “I’m sure a violin player would be appalled by [the spike fiddle]” he says with a chuckle. “But it’s been amazing for me. I use it on almost every record.” Smith also cites groups such as Einsturzende Neubauten and Art Ensemble of Chicago for inspiring him to craft unusual tools. “I’d see pictures of them where their stage was just littered with stuff,” he recalls. “I would think, ‘wow, I’d love to be on that stage. I want to handle all that stuff and see what noises it all makes.’\"\n\nMost of Smith’s hand-made instruments reside in the small recording studio he’s set up in a house he shares with his wife and seven-year old son. That’s just one benefit he’s found from moving to Los Angeles. “There’s an anonymity factor here,” he says. “It’s just so big and sprawling, you can find your little space and inhabit it.” As to whether his environment has a tangible effect on his music, he’s not so sure. A lifelong Californian, he doesn’t consider his work “desert music.” But his sounds do often have a open-spaces feel, and he has noticed that “on a lot of my album covers, there’s this kind of long-distance horizon imagery. That’s always stuck in the back of my head for some reason.”\n\nDistinctive album art has been just one of the ways Smith has been able to separate his various musical persona. The sonic differences grow stronger with each release, something that Entering/Returning accelerated. “It definitely helped define [the two projects] more,” he insists. “On other records I think you can hear more of a crossover, but this made things move to the left and the right. Louder guitars and fuzz organ on the Khol LP—big drifts of sound—and prettier, more song-oriented stuff on the solo record.”\n\nUlaan Markhor, on the other hand, is “more like a rock band.\" For that project, every track he makes starts with drums; often he’ll record hours of himself drumming and then sift through the results to find beats to structure songs around. By contrast, Ulaan Passarine is about arrangements. “A lot of what I do elsewhere is improvised, so Ulaan Passarine is an opportunity to work out different melody lines, and see how they layer over each other,” he says.\n\nSmith’s next two releases will be his second Ulaan Markhor LP on Soft Abuse and a Ulaan Passarine album likely via his own label, Worstward. Beyond that, Smith plans to continue to simply hit record and see what happens. “A lot of it is like painting,” he explains. “You’re putting colors on the canvas. You erase things and you put more stuff on. Sometimes you get lucky and the first thing you put up works… sometimes it takes longer.” —Marc Masters\n\nNext: The many sides of Cian Nugent\n\nIII: Cian Nugent: Team Play\n\n__\n\n__\n\nIn December, the Dublin-born guitarist Cian Nugent asked his childhood hero to join a band he’d yet to start. Nugent was flatly rejected.\n\nHe’d gone to see Yo La Tengo at Vicar Street, a large venue in central Dublin. After the show, he was lingering near the merchandise table when he spied a familiar but aging face—a member of U2, he first suspected. But a friend corrected his rock star-spotting inability: “That’s fucking John O’Neill from the Undertones.”\n\nNugent, who admits that he’d had more than a little to drink, rushed up to O’Neill and confessed how much the Undertones had meant to him as a child. He’d listened to “Teenage Kicks”, the Undertones’ iconic first single, hundreds of times and cried. Even now, it remains one of his favorite tunes.\n\nBut O’Neill didn’t want to join his band. “I’m a fucking old guy,” he quipped. “Don’t start a band with me. Start a band with a young guy.”\n\nNugent, 24, already had started a band with a young guy—several of them, actually\n\nMore than a decade before, Nugent, then 12, met O’Neill when his mother took him to see the Undertones. O’Neill told the young, enthusiastic kid to check out the White Stripes, then on the precipice of international fame. The comment created ripples through the rest of Nugent’s life, setting him on a course where he not only pursued more garage rock but also explored blues and folk forms, thanks to hints Jack White would soon drop in interviews.\n\nAt present, Nugent maintains those broad interests in no less than five projects. He is best known as a young solo guitarist, whose interpretations of folk idioms both European and American run like ribbons from his six strings. But on two excellent records—2011’s symphonic-minded Doubles and this year’s more aggressive Born with the Caul—he’s constructed ornate compositions from those acoustic blueprints with the help of a full band, lately dubbed the Cosmos. He’s also in Desert Heat, a two-guitar trio with Steve Gunn, and the No. 1s, a lovable power-pop group formed with some of his oldest friends. He insists that his newest band, Cryboys, is his favorite.\n\nI spoke with Nugent about what he calls “the incoherent range of the mess that is my musical career,” how he moves between his projects, and why Mick Jagger remains a distinctly European pockmark.\n\nSOLO ACOUSTIC GUITAR\n\nWhen Nugent first started recording his acoustic guitar tunes, he was a teenager influenced by a century or so of giants—from long-late elders Blind Willie Johnson to Bert Jansch and onward to the likes of Jack Rose and Jack White. The burden of such history was enormous, so Nugent worried whether what he did was of any value. To find out, he sent a collection of songs to Rose and Glenn Jones. When they responded favorably, he says, he reckoned he’d best keep playing.\n\nEmbed is unavailable.\n\nI was reading interviews with Jack White. He would talk about Mississippi Fred McDowell or Robert Johnson, and through that, I got into the old American folk thing. I remember getting the Anthology of American Folk Music; that stuff was the most unfamiliar music ever, but it was strangely quite accessible as well.\n\nThere was a record shop in a town near mine, and I’d but records that looked interesting. I bought a record of Doc Watson. I knew he was a guitar guy, and there was a song called “Deep River Blues,” where he did an alternating-bass, fingerpicking thing. He plays it real slow at the beginning, showing the audience that this is how you do it. I remember thinking, “Oh, that is how you do that.” I felt I could figure out how to do that guitar playing—it’s something that you figure out how to do, and then you can just do it.\n\nBut singing is your own voice. You really have to have something to say. Almost all the music I liked was American, so when I sang, I was faced with the problem, “Do I sing in an American accent, or do I sing American music in an Irish accent?” Singing in an American accent is the most hokey thing ever. Mick Jagger spent 40 years of his career doing it, and it’s still embarrassing. But when I heard John Fahey, he didn’t sing at all. Up until that point, I thought it wasn’t really a song if you don’t sing.\n\nIt felt like a real ask of the audience to listen to just acoustic instrumental guitar stuff. Even now, five or six years later, I am still aware that it is a demand on the audience to ask them to just listen to instrumental acoustic guitar music. We grow up listening to songs. I love a good song. I love a good story. And we sometimes relate more to the words than to the music, and that’s the difference between instrumental music and lyrical music. I would argue you can still tell a story with instrumental music, but it requires more interpretation on the part of the listener. They have to tell themselves the story. Perhaps there is a narrative, but it’s not a didactic narrative. The story is the tone, almost.\n\nACOUSTIC GUITAR BACKED BY A FULL BAND, THE COSMOS\n\nIt’s not a novel approach for solo acoustic guitarists to augment their compositions with all manner of accompaniment. John Fahey and Sandy Bull toyed with electronics, and Jack Rose played with a string band. Nugent’s two LPs under his own name certainly key on his guitar playing, so much so that his band often disappears entirely. But on the new Born with the Caul*, the accompaniment seems evermore essential, as though Nugent considers himself less an instrumentalist and more a bandleader. Especially on that record’s closer, “The Houses of Parliament”, that shift results in moments of total ecstasy.*\n\nEmbed is unavailable.\n\nThere’s a great band in Dublin called The Dinah Brand—classic, really good songwriting rock. The bass player is named David Lacey; normally, Dave’s instrument is drums, and he does a lot of freely improvised music and homemade electronics. He also loves rip-roaring free jazz. I showed him the song “Sixes & Sevens”, and he started doing more abstract percussion—bowed cymbals, bowed bells, more unusual drums.\n\nWhen we came to record it, I thought, “I’d love clarinet on here.” Another friend of mine, Ailbhe [Nic Oireachtaigh], was around, and we said, “Maybe viola would be cool here as well?”\n\nHaving different players’ voices changes the overall sound and tone, but the hope is that you find a place where you all match up. It’s like any band: You’re all looking for a spot where you can link. Dave found a way to lock into what I was doing that added things I would have never thought to add myself. He has a very different approach than me. When we’d be playing together, we’d lock in on the rhythms. We’d get into more repetitive, longer parts, where we were just focusing on the rhythm. I found that contrast really cool.\n\nI got really excited with the group. There is this thing that happens when you’re playing with other people that doesn’t happen when you’re playing on your own: You all just link up to this one spot. I’ve become a bit of a junkie for that.\n\nAfter doing Doubles, recording with a band for Born With the Caul felt more natural. We had an idea of how it would go. It was very exciting to have this guitar stuff and hear it turned into a band. When we do a band arrangement, you find all the elements that are there need more time to say their piece. We were working on a new song, for example, and I had a demo of it that was five minutes. Then we played it, and it was 12 minutes all of the sudden: “Where did that time come from?”\n\nDESERT HEAT\n\nUnder their respective names, Nugent and Philadelphia instrumentalist, songwriter, sideman and bandleader Steve Gunn released two of the more noteworthy guitar-oriented records of 2013. Nugent’s Born with the Caul and Gunn’s Time Off shared an important distinction in that they expanded the suspected aesthetics of both, too: Where Nugent leapt at times into outbursts that alternately suggested American string bands and the intertwining rock of Television, Gunn emerged as a new folk-rock auteur.\n\nTogether, Gunn and Nugent were involved in another of the year’s best guitar explorations: Cat Mask at Huggie Temple*, their two-track debut as the ad hoc trio Desert Heat with drummer John Truscinksi, picked up threads of melody and followed them into valleys and up toward the atmosphere. It was Nugent’s proper introduction to improvising—and a sterling one, too.*\n\nI met Steve Gunn at The Time of Rivers Fest in Portland, Maine in 2008. A year or two later, he said, “I’m coming over to Europe. Maybe we could do some dates together.” We didn’t know each other really well, so it was a bit of a gamble because we could have hated each other. Thankfully, we didn’t.\n\nWe were both playing solo, and at the end of the evening, we said, “Why don’t we just jam on some stuff together?” We had similar styles, but they were different enough that playing together was really interesting and exciting. He would do things that I didn’t do, and I did some things he wouldn’t do. Then, Steve and John Truscinski were doing duo sets together for a couple of days. I was blown away. A gig came up in Brussels in this bowling alley, and they said, “Have you got anything that you could do, the three of you?” We decided to give it a go. We were drunk enough that we were confident we could.\n\nSolo, I’ve done bits of improvised stuff, but I’d never really gone in the deep end and had nothing planned. Desert Heat was the first thing that was completely improvised. When we were all playing together, it just worked. And it was super fun, being in a bowing alley with people bowling on either side of us.\n\nI am not group leader in Desert Heat, so it’s less pressure. We’re all just a band. When I’m playing with The Cosmos, all the other players are good at coming up with parts and having input, but I tend to be the group leader who has to say, “This is what we should do.” We also tend not to play totally loose. I do enjoy playing improvised, but it can go any way. It can work, or it can’t work and be the worst thing ever.\n\nCRYBOYS\n\nNugent sings during Born with the Caul*, but it’s only brief and a bit hesitant, his voice bounced into the distance by reverb and echo. Remember, just a few years ago, he didn’t want to sing at all. But that’s progressively changing, as evidenced by a new folk-rock, singer-songwriter quartet that pairs him with a set of other accomplished Irish writers. They’ve got an album of songs prepared, and they plan to enter the studio to make their debut in the next several months.*\n\nOver the past year or so, I’ve been doing this song band, Cryboys. I believe it is actually a nickname for the Dallas Cowboys that we didn’t know about. I hope they don’t sue us.\n\nIt’s the opposite of Desert Heat—no improvisation at all, a total written-song band. I am doing that with Dylan Phillips, who is the singer in The Dinah Brand. Dylan, in my mind, is the best songwriter Ireland has ever produced, other than somebody like Phil Lynott. He really understands songwriting. I asked him, “Do you want to try writing songs together?” I’m loving writing lyrics, singing, doing vocal harmonies. It’s something that I’ve never done before, but it’s probably my favorite music.\n\nTHE NO. 1S\n\nOne of Nugent’s projects doesn’t share much with the other, and it’s The No. 1s, a Dublin garage-pop quartet that bounds ahead with hooks made for instant attachment. Or at least at first glance, The No. 1s might seem to be the outlier: Aside from Nugent, the bratty pep squad shares drummer Conor Lumsden with The Cosmos, in which he plays bass. Sharon*, their three-song EP from late last year, is a perfectly bittersweet romp, bursting open with the title cut and drifting to a close with the sad-eye and relatively slow-motion “Girl”.*\n\nMy big thing when I was a teenager was garage rock. My favorite band were the Gun Club. I was big into The Cramps, The Gun Club, The Gories. My first gig ever was The Undertones. At the sbow, my mother met the O’Neills’, from the Undertones, mother in the queue for hot dogs. She got to chatting to their mom. I was around 12 at the time. My mother came over with the O’Neill’s mother, and she said, “Do you want me to get the boys over?” John O’Neill came over, and he said, “Oh, you’re into music then?” And I said, “Yeah, yeah, I love The Undertones. It’s so cool to meet you.”\n\nHe said that if I was into The Undertones, I should look out for The White Stripes. I hadn’t heard them. Within a few months, they became one of the biggest bands. I had the hot tip off John O’Neill, and I was an excited 12-year-old. I was at the perfect age to get into a really big band playing rock ’n’ roll. They introduced me to so much music I loved, from punk stuff to folk stuff. At that age, it was the perfect thing.\n\nThe No. 1s is kind of going back to all the stuff I was into growing up—garage rock and punk rock. Eddie Kenrick is one of my oldest friends. He started writing songs, and he started playing with Seán Goucher, the other songwriter in the No. 1s. I said, “If you need a bass player, I’d totally be into being in a punk band.” We all love this kind of music.\n\nI must seem stylistically incoherent to people. But if you love something, what’s the harm in doing it? I’d hate to think of a musician feeling like they can’t do something because it doesn’t make sense with what else they’re doing. —Grayson Currin\n\nNext: The outward progression of Leyla McCalla\n\nIV: Leyla McCalla: Classically Trained Creolo\n\n____Photo by Tim Duffy\n\nSitting on the street in New Orleans, playing Bach’s Cello Suites by memory, Leyla McCalla assumed the man taking her photograph was just another tourist. She was a young street musician, after all, situated at the corner of Royal and Conti streets in the French Quarter, between the fabled Café Beignet and a police station. And his family was with him. But when the man finally spoke to McCalla, she understood that he’d been looking for her—actually, he’d been sent to find her.\n\n“He said, ‘You have a sister named Sabine McCalla who goes to Warren Wilson College and lives in Asheville, North Carolina,’” she remembers. “Who is this?”\n\nThe man with the camera was Tim Duffy, the manager of the pioneering African-American string band the Carolina Chocolate Drops and the founder of the Music Maker Relief Foundation, a nonprofit that locates and advocates for the country’s aging folk and blues musicians. At a Chocolate Drops show in Asheville, Duffy had met Sabine—a young, black fiddle student interested in string-band music. She piqued his interest as part of the narrative the Drops had been telling tirelessly for years, of how American folk music was a multi-racial form, not simply one of white provenance. She pointed him instead to her older sister, a classically trained cellist subsisting in New Orleans by playing Bach, folk songs and some tunes based around the poems of Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes. That’s who the Drops should meet, she said.\n\nDuffy agreed. After that initial encounter in the French Quarter, they gathered later for drinks. McCalla gave him the four-song CD she’d made back in New York and told him of her plans to create a larger project from Hughes’ words. A few weeks later, he wrote to say that he wanted to manage her. He even asked her to come play on Leaving Eden, the follow-up to the Drops’ Grammy-winning major label debut. These ideas she’d had suddenly had new momentum.\n\n“It gave me a focus about my work that I didn’t have. Before, it was, ‘Wake up. Get on your bicycle with your cello. Set up your little spot. Play,’” she says. “But he said this is great music. You should create what you’ve been wanting to create.”\n\nThat conversation occurred in 2010, not long after McCalla had permanently relocated to New Orleans from her native New York. And at last, she’s done what Duffy suggested then, to finish her own project and start her career. McCalla’s debut—the stunning 13-song set Vari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes—sets Hughes’ poems, traditional Haitian numbers sung in Creole and a handful of yearning originals to the pizzicato warmth of McCalla’s cello. Her playing—on cello, tenor banjo and guitar—suggests a perpetual spring, giving these songs about losing innocence and finding death a vibrancy that fits their folk music function. Her voice is a velvety purr that’s both wise and bright, not unlike the surreal sophistication of Jolie Holland’s best work.\n\n“I never saw the cello as, ‘This is what’s going to make me different.’ I know that’s a big part of what has shaped my ear and how I hear things,” she says. “But I’m focused more on expressing these songs than my cello technique, because there’s so much I can do on cello that I never do on stage. The songs that I play and the stories I tell are what makes me different. I think of myself as an artist first. These are my tools.”\n\nPhoto by Tim Duffy\n\nAt 28, McCalla’s life and musical education have been defined by a steadily outward expansion of her interests and approaches. She began playing cello in elementary school after a teacher handed her one as an assignment. She steadily grew her repertoire and honed her skills as a young classical musician. At home, her parents, both Haitian immigrants who’d arrived in America as children, mostly played the sounds of cultural assimilation—Stevie Wonder and Bob Marley, Paul Simon and James Taylor. They kept in touch with the sound of Haiti’s modern compas music, but the island nation’s traditional songs did not soundtrack McCalla’s childhood.\n\nInstead, she found the trail of folk music through a friend’s mother, who sang old-time American songs and played guitar. When she was 13, McCalla began teaching herself to pick six strings instead of four, playing the songs she learned from the mentor, plus the Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins numbers she loved on the radio. Those very casual studies shaped a strange parallel to her more academic musicianship.\n\nThough she eventually studied cello at New York University, she began to understand that the cloistered world of classical music might not be in her future. After all, she’d mostly put the instrument down after her family moved to Ghana for two years. (“There was no one to study with there and it put my conservatory hopes on hold,” she told The Guardian last year.) Back in New York, when she was 18, McCalla met the cellist Rufus Cappadocia, who dominated a five-string cello in a Haitian roots music band. He plucked and strummed and plundered the groove in a way that she didn’t know was possible. He became her teacher, and the possibilities of the instrument she’d played since fourth grade suddenly exploded. She worked as a cocktail waitress at the Williamsburg venue and restaurant Zebulon, too, an experience that further stretched her understanding of what music might become.\n\n“I had my eye outside of that classical scene,” she says. “I don’t want to live my life with these people. I don’t even like being around them in school. I didn’t care enough about classical music to suffer for it. I have a completely different relationship with my own music now.”\n\nThat relationship stems in large part from the two years she spent touring with the Carolina Chocolate Drops after Duffy found her in New Orleans. That stint gave her surprising insights not only into the songs they played but into the strange social dynamics that playing them created.\n\n“It was such a unique experience to be part of a folk band that was all black, even as a black person. It’s not like we all think the same thing about everything,” she says, laughing. “I don’t think white folk bands had the conversations that we had. And that’s the essence of the Carolina Chocolate Drops: They start conversations that a lot of other bands don’t go near. ”\n\nHowever auspicious Vari-Colored Songs might be, it seems only like the beginning of its own conversation, a prelude for McCalla rather than an endpoint. She already seems to have pushed past its even acoustic keel and generally pleasant atmosphere, moved as she is these days by more lively Creole and Cajun tunes. And though she largely plucks the cello’s strings on Vari-Colored Songs, she’s working on new songs that incorporate more bowing and, overall, more ideas to stretch her set. And the cultural continuum between Haiti and Louisiana is something she hopes to share through her music. She wants to redefine the attitudes people have about the influence of the benighted country.\n\nA cellist who sings Langston Hughes poems might seem plenty different to many. McCalla insists, however, that this is only her initial step.\n\n“I feel like I have a few techniques that you might not have seen,” she says, “but I feel like there’s so much more I could be doing.” —Grayson Currin"
