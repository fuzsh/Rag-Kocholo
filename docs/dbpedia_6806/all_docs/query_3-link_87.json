        "text": "New Delhi: Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman was conferred with the Dadasaheb Phalke Lifetime Achievement Award at the 69th National Film Awards on Tuesday. Getting emotional while receiving the award, Waheeda said she shares the honour with her co-workers in the film industry.\n\nWaheeda wore a cream and golden coloured saree, and accessorised it with a green necklace and matching earrings. She tied her hair in a bun. On the red carpet, the actor expressed gratitude for the honour and said, \"I am so happy and grateful. I had a wonderful journey and I am thankful that I could reach this milestone in life.\"\n\nKnown for films like ‘Guide’, ‘Pyaasa’, ‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’, ‘Delhi-6’, ‘Kaagaz Ke Phool’ and several others, the actress has played countless memorable characters on the celluloid, and has a career spanning almost seven decades.\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu and other dignitaries present on the occasion gave the standing ovation to the legendary actress, making her emotional.\n\nActor R Madhavan, who was also present, went up to the emotional actor and spoke to her.\n\nA video of Waheeda was played in the auditorium, which showed glimpses of her movies.\n\nWaheeda can be seen saying in the video: \"My father was an IAS officer, and was broad minded. In my childhood I planned to become a doctor. Then I developed a love for dancing. My parents didn't stop me. Slowly and steadily I came into movies.\"\n\n\"First I did the Telugu movie 'Rojulu Marayi' in 1955, in which there was my dance sequence, and it was a success. Then I got my first Hindi movie 'CID' (1956). 'Guide' is my favourite because it is a different character. I always believe in good work,and have always listened to my heart. I want people to remember me as a good human being,\" said the iconic actress.\n\nAfter receiving the award the 85-year-old actress said: \"I feel very honoured and humbled. The place where I am standing today is because of my lovely industry. Luckily I have worked with top directors, producers, writers, technicians, music directors. They have given me great support, love and respect throughout my journey.\"\n\n\"I also thank my makeup artists, hair, and costume designers, who have played an important role in my career. I want to share this award with all the departments of my film industry. Koi bhi ek insaan, ek poori picture nahi bana sakta. Un sabko hum sabki zaroorat hoti hai. Thank you very much,\" she added."
