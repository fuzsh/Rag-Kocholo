        "text": "Sudesh Salgaonkar a.k.a Sudesh Nirbhaya recently won the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his outstanding achievements in the field of folk dances of India\n\nKALYANI JHA | NT BUZZ\n\nSudesh Nirbhaya’s love for dance has fetched him many national and international awards in the past two decades. And now the engineer and founder of IT firm VIVA Networks, has added another feather to his cap by recently winning the Dadasaheb Phalke award for his outstanding achievement in the field of folk dances of India.\n\nHaving begun with participating in local competitions at the village level, Salagaonkar, who specialises in Indian folk dances, has tons of accolades to his name.\n\nOne of his most noteworthy achievements was being crowned as the Best Dance Choreographer- GOA at the International Glory Award (IGA) 2019. He also won the Special Honor Award and Best Choreography Award from former Prime Minister of Nepal, Madhav Kumar. Salagaonkar is also the only Goan to represent Goa six times at All India dance competitions.\n\nHe also choreographed the 2023 National Games’ closing ceremony in Goa and did the choreography for the welcome of Sadhguru in Goa for the Save Soil movement.\n\nSpeaking about his recent win, he shares that one of his friends from Mumbai filed the nomination under the category of Folk Dance, in February. “Following this, I got a call that my profile was shortlisted and in the first week of April, I got the confirmation that I had been declared the winner,” he shares, adding that the award is presented based on the contributions in the field and achievements.\n\nSalgaonkar has his own dance school called Nirbhaya Bhavan Dance School. “I collaborate with Bal Bhavan, Panaji, and other governmental institutions like village panchayat and I have 13 centres in Goa where we train students and take them for championships,” he shares. “We teach all dance forms like classical, western, Bollywood, contemporary, and hip hop. We also have a separate fitness segment for ladies,” he says.\n\nGoing forward, Salgaonkar is now looking at pitching his own curriculum for dance to be rolled out in educational institutions.\n\n“We have created a short-term course kind of format for learning dance with a properly set syllabus and exam pattern. I am in talks with the Goa Education Department to start this new curriculum at high school and university level soon,” he shares. “I hope the government will accept my proposal because currently, students are under a lot of stress. However, if they dance for 40 to 45 minutes, it can reduce this anxiety and stress.”\n\nBesides students, this curriculum is open to anyone and is not age-bound. “It covers metabolism, physical strength, core dance, and flexibility. Within three months of classes, any person who is willing but has never practiced any dance can perform easily,” he says."
