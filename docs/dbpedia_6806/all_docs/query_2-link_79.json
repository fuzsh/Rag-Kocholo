        "text": "At the recently concluded India Today conclave in Mumbai, as Arjun Kapoor delivered a speech on the changing definition of the Bollywood hero, there was one actor he, unsurprisingly, was the most effusive about: Amitabh Bachchan. \"He redefined what a hero could be,\" Kapoor said, invoking the angry young man tag the actor earned in the 1970s. \"India realised for the first time that he [hero] can be a rebel... He [Bachchan] was the Don. Actually, he still is in many ways.\" The success of Badla, a he-said, she-said thriller that largely unfolds in a room, and which earned Rs 87 crore at the box office, was proof that Bachchan is still relevant even after four decades. \"That man has transcended generations and god knows what he is capable of in the future.\"\n\nThis was no hyperbole. Bachchan, who was bestowed with the prestigious Dada Saheb Phalke Award for his 'outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian cinema', is continuing to set benchmarks for actors. He has, in fact, inspired a whole generation of them. From Aamir Khan who calls him king, to Ranveer Singh, who realised acting was his calling when he performed Bachchan's iconic scenes from Deewaar at university. At 76, Bachchan is still going strong. Currently on daily quizzing duty for Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Big B--writer of a daily blog, sender of flattering letters and big bouquets to his younger peers, the face of many public service campaigns--is also one of Bollywood's busiest actors. He will make a guest appearance in Telugu epic Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy and later headline Jhund, the Hindi debut of popular Marathi filmmaker Nagraj Manjule (Fandry, Sairat). Next year, there will be at least two big projects in Brahmastra and Gulabo Sitabo where joining him will be Ranbir Kapoor and Ayushmann Khurrana, respectively. The last film is Bachchan's third collaboration with Shoojit Sircar.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn an interview with India Today magazine last year, Sircar, who has worked with Bachchan on the yet-unreleased Shoebite as well as Piku and Pink (which won Bachchan his third and fourth National Awards respectively), singled out the actor's \"childlike\" demeanour as the key factor for his longevity. \"If you give him a nice two-page script, it's like giving a toffee to a kid,\" said Sircar. \"As a personality, he is intimidating but, inside, he is the most innocent. He has no clue about commercial aspects at all. He just wants to act.\" Indeed, the box-office doesn't drive Bachchan. His biggest hit in recent years, the Thugs of Hindostan, earned Rs 138 crore net at the domestic box office, but it was also one of the biggest duds of 2018, nowhere near its estimated budget of almost Rs 250 crore. But then Bachchan is not new to failure. Remember Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag?\n\nThe Dada Saheb Phalke honour couldn't have come at a better time as Bachchan rings in his 50th year as an actor. It has been an eventful journey to the top. His cinematic debut came in 1969 when he took on two roles: one behind the scenes as a voiceover artist in Mrinal Sen's Bhuvan Shome, the other in front of the camera with Saat Hindustani. But success eluded him until Zanjeer (1973) in which Bachchan won plaudits for his performance as a police officer. It was also the beginning of his iconic partnership with screenwriters Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar aka Salim-Javed. The duo would bring out the best of his intense persona by giving him defining characters to play in films such Deewaar, Sholay, Trishul, Don, Kaala Patthar and Shakti.\n\nEven as he became a poster-boy for the youth of the '70s and '80s, Bachchan demonstrated a more mature, sensitive side in films such as Abhimaan, Millie, Kabhie Kabhie and Silsila. At the peak of his career, in 1982, he suffered the devastating intestinal injury on the sets of Coolie. It would take him nearly two decades to regain his glory. Barring Agneepath, the 1990s were mostly a forgettable decade for Bachchan fans, who saw their idol make questionable choices and struggle financially with his unsuccessful Amitabh Bachchan Corporation.\n\nMore from Insight | What the latest women's survey says about the RSS | India Today Insight\n\nIt was only in the 2000s when Hindi cinema underwent a seismic shift and a fresh, young crop of filmmakers began experimenting with ideas, that Bachchan became its biggest beneficiary. The decade would see him star in a string of popular films, including Sarkar, Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham, Black, Cheeni Kum and Bhootnath. Other bold films such as Aks, Nishabd and Shamitabh showed him as an actor eager to experiment and explore the shades of grey in human behaviour. The past nine years have seen him only cement his name firmly in the history books of Indian cinema.\n\nFor Siddhartha Basu, who is responsible for amplifying Bachchan's prestige and increasing his fan following with KBC, the actor's 'charisma' is unparalleled. Perhaps only Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu and Mohanlal in Kerala come close to matching it in their respective states. \"In a country where they believe that Laxmi aur Saraswati ek chhat ke neeche vaas nahin kar sakti, we needed somebody who would culturally make it acceptable, somebody who had a foot in high culture as well as the common touch,\" says Basu. \"He occupies that status.\" The demigod stature is there to see as contestants are often found tongue-tied and reverential in his presence. Bachchan uses his curiosity, candidness and grandfatherly demeanour to ease them up.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the big screen, he continues to command the audience's attention with his deep, baritone voice and piercing eyes. India's biggest cinematic honour comes when this grandfather of three is still brimming with energy. He is one man who firmly believes the show must go on.\n\nAlso Read | Alia Bhatt on Amitabh Bachchan's Dadasaheb Phalke Award win: He is a legend, yet a humble person"
