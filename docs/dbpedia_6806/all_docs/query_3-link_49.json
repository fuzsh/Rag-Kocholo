        "text": "In the recently held Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival, Bollywood star Bobby Deol claimed yet another award, Best Actor in a Negative Role for Animal.Â This marks Bobby’s second win at the esteemed awards, having previously been honored as the Best Actor-Web Series in 2020 for âAashramâ.\n\nBobby Deol’s win for ‘ Animal ’ underscores his prowess as a versatile actor capable of delivering performances that resonate with audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom his previous win in 2020 to the current spotlight on ‘ Animal ,’ Bobby’s journey is one of continuous growth and artistic evolution. The Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards serve as a fitting acknowledgment of his impactful contributions to Indian cinema.\n\nExpressing the gratitude, Bobby Deol said, “It’s always overwhelming when your work gets appreciated and you get awarded for it. I thank âDadasaheb Phalke International Film Festivalâ for honouring me with this. I want to tell the youngsters who try to find good work, that never give up. Believe in yourself, and one day that moment will come in your life. For me, ‘Animal’ changed everything. I still feel I’m dreaming. The first person I want to thank is Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who when I was not doing mainstream cinema believed in something inside me as an actor and gave me the opportunity. And these opportunities are so rare.I especially want to thank my fans who stood by me for 28 years of my career and gave me so much energy with their unconditional love. This is for you.”\n\nResponding to compliments about his no dialogue role and eye expressions, Bobby spoke about taking up challenging roles saying, “I used to keep telling myself that I’m going to take up challenging roles which are not in my comfort zone, but I didn’t think that they will shut my mouth only. Because to express, you need to have a voice. But I think every actor first makes you feel through their eyes. I believe that words are not required. It’s how you feel and emote.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate Bobby Deol’s future projects and canât wait to see his big debut in south with Kanguva."
