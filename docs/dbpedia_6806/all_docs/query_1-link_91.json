It was instituted in 1969, the birth centenary year of Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema.\n\nThe award for a particular year is given during the end of the following year along with the National Film Awards. The Bombay High Court had directed the Directorate of Film Festivals of India (DFFI) to consider uncensored films for the competition, a case which DFFI contested and won in the Supreme Court in late 2006. The case had delayed announcement of the award for 2006, which was announced in the middle of 2008. The 2007 award which had to be announced at the end of 2008 was announced in September 2009. The 2008 award was announced on 19 January, 2010.\n\nRecipients:\n\nNational\n\nAwards Year Winner Occupation State\n\n17th 1969 Devika Rani actress Andhra Pradesh\n\n18 1970 B. N.
