        "text": "New Delhi: Dadasaheb Phalke Award winning producer and founder of Suresh Productions, D. Ramanaidu passed away after suffering from chronic illness on Wednesday.\n\nThe 78-year-old producer was suffering from prostrate cancer and he was undergoing treatment for it at a private hospital in Hyderabad. Ramanaidu's death came as a huge shock to the Telugu film industry. Celebrities expressed shock and grief on hearing news of the producer's death.\n\nHe is survived by sons Suresh Babu, Venkatesh Daggubati, daughter Daggubati Laxmi and grandson Rana Daggubati.\n\nRamanaidu produced over 150 films in 15 different languages under his banner Suresh Productions. Born in 1936, he moved to Madras in early 1960s in search of opportunities in the film industry. He had set up Rama Studios in Hyderabad in late 1980s and produced several films. His elder son Suresh took over his production business later. His second son Venkatesh is an actor in Telugu film industry.\n\nHe also joined politics and represented Bapatla Lok Sabha constituency for Telugu Desam Party from 1999 to 2004. He contested the 2004 elections but lost and kept away from politics since then. However, he was still a member of Telugu Desam Party.\n\nRamanaidu was conferred with Dada Saheb Phalke Award in 2009 and Padmabhushan in 2012."
