The producer went on to set up the state-of-the art Ramanaidu Film Studio in Hyderabad, besides another studio in the picturesque port city of Visakhapatnam.\n\nRama Naidu joined TDP and represented Bapatla Lok Sabha constituency in the 13th Lok Sabha though he stayed away from politics after that.\n\nHe set up a charitable trust that supports schools, colleges, old age homes and hospitals.\n\nRama Naidu was awarded an honorary doctorate by S V University, Tirupati.\n\nHis elder son Suresh Babu is a leading producer, while younger son Venkatesh continues to be a successful hero in Telugu. His grandson Rana Daggubati has a successful career as an actor in Telugu and he also did Bollywood films like 'Dum Maro Dum' and 'Baby'.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
