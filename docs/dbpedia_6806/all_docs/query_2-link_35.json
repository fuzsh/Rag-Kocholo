        "text": "A Groundbreaking Crime Film. The Arrest of Goudie. In 1901, Mitchell and Kenyon released a 6-minute silent film called The Arrest of Goudie. This film is arguably the world's first filmed crime reconstruction. It depicts the arrest of Thomas Goudie, a Bank of Liverpool employee who embezzled £170,000 (equivalent to around £23 million in today's money) while involved in a gambling ring. The film was shot on location in Liverpool, using the actual crime scenes. It shows Goudie being arrested at the house where he was hiding, and then being taken to the police station. The film also shows the interior of the bank where Goudie worked, and the gambling den where he lost the stolen money. The Arrest of Goudie was a very popular film when it was first released. It was shown in cinemas all over the world, and it is thought to have been seen by millions of people. The film is now considered to be an important historical document, as it provides a unique glimpse into life in Liverpool at the turn of the 20th century. The film is also notable for its technical achievements. For example, Mitchell and Kenyon used a variety of camera angles and editing techniques to create a sense of drama and suspense. The film also features a number of special effects, such as a scene in which Goudie disappears into thin air. The Arrest of Goudie is a fascinating and important film. It is a must-see for anyone interested in crime history, film history, or the history of Liverpool.

The actor, who was subsequently fired from Disney‘s Marvel Cinematic Universe, will star in the independent revenge thriller Merciless, which will be helmed by Martin Villeneuve, the younger brother of Dune director Denis Villeneuve. Written by Frank Hannah, the upcoming film follows a CIA investigator who goes to troubling lengths after the one he loves is overpowered by sinister forces. Filming is expected to begin in Saskatchewan, Canada in autumn. Majors was sentenced in April to one year of domestic violence counselling after he was found guilty of assaulting and harassing his ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari. Following a two-week trial, the actor was ordered to complete a 52-week in-person program in Los Angeles. Majors has always denied the assault allegations. During the sentencing, the 34-year-old actor avoided prison time for the offence, which would have seen him incarcerated for one year. Jonathan Majors as Kang in ‘Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania’. Credit: Alamy Before his arrest in March 2023, Majors’ star status was on the rise, having appeared in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Creed III, as well as the Emmy-winning TV series Lovecraft Country. Following the guilty verdict, Marvel Studios severed ties with Majors, who played the new central villain, Kang the Conqueror, in the MCU. He was expected to appear in a number of upcoming films in the comic book franchise, including 2026’s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film’s title has now been scrapped, and the project will be officially known as Avengers 5 until a new title is chosen. The decision to completely change the name of the film suggests that Kang will be written out of the franchise, as opposed to being recast. As a result of the conviction, Majors was also dropped by his management company, Entertainment 360, as well as his publicity firm, the Lede Company. Merciless is being produced by Christopher Tuffin, who previously announced his plans to start a new media venture that “refuses to let the court of public opinion and selective prosecution undermine great art and artists.” “In graduate school, I had the good fortune to study screenwriting under Blacklist scribe Millard Lampell and learned from him the dangers of letting politics undermine due process and deprive artists of their careers,” Tuffin said in a statement (via Variety). “I consider it an honor and a privilege to be working with such a great talent now that this matter has been adjudicated.” The post Jonathan Majors lands first film role since domestic assault conviction appeared first on NME. - #news #business #world ------------------------------\n\n**Shree Venkatesh Films is a disgrace to Bengali Film Industry!!** Yesterday, SVF Entertainment blocked us over Instagram for posting periodic reviews about their films and pointing out the anti-nationals. This is how they silence the patriots. We consider it as yet another feather on our cap. Previously Derek, the Anglo Indian Street D0G, had blocked us. We have scrutinized this shameful action of SVF, and here are the probable reasons behind it: 1. Our last vernacular presentation \"Awjana Tawthyo\" got 8,773+ hits on Tinyurl. It was released 3 days ahead of the film's release, got spread massively across WB and it turned out to be a catastrophic blow to the film's BO collection. Made with a meager budget of 6.5 Cr INR which evokes laughter when compared with Dravidian biggies, the multi-starrer film has failed to collect even 10 Cr INR at BO so far after over a month since its release. The presentation is available in one of our previous posts. 2. The Bengali Film Industry has been infested with incompetent Commy Artists with theatre backgrounds and poor education qualifications, and they could be recently seen extending their support to Palestine, one such post has been shared through the image in this post. Some have also deemed our PM a Panauti on social media for being present during the final match of ICC Men's WC and also for organizing the match at Ahmedabad instead of Eden Gardens. The Commy Leeches held a joint meeting to put pressure on SVF to block us. This makes the feather even brighter. It's high time the name Ahmedabad is changed to something meaningful, so it doesn't result in further misfortunes. 3. SVF Co-Founder Shrikant Taklaa Mohta was arrested by CBI in link with the Rose Valley Chit Fund Scam, where he had accepted 25 Cr INR unscrupulously from the Rose Valley Group Owner who is presently in jail. The ED & CBI are investigating the various scams that are crippling WB's economic prosperity and a significant share of the siphoned money is being churned in the State's film industry through fraudulent organizations like SVF. Shrikant has become Taklaa because he is unable to get adequate sleep due to fear of being jailed. Fraudulence is SVF's signature, hence they prefer to block the Nationalists. 4. SVF's next film \"Bogla Mama\" is scheduled to release tomorrow and SVF is shit scared that we may come up with another presentation and post periodic reviews of the film on their IG handle. However, we can't afford to spare our valuable time on an extremely low-budget film like that. It's high time WB boycotts SVF since it will help distribute the total revenue/resources across a much wider base of genuine/deserving artists and starve the Commy boot lickers. What's your opinion? #Bengal #Politics"
