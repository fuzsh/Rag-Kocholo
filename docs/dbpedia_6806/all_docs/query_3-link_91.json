        "text": "New Delhi: Screen icon Waheeda Rehman on Tuesday became the eighth woman artiste to receive the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest recognition in the field of Indian cinema, an honour she dedicated to her 'dear film industry' and its various departments.\n\n'I feel very honoured and humbled... But whatever I have achieved today, it is because of my dear film industry. Luckily, I got to work with top directors, producers, filmmakers, technicians, writers, dialogue writers, music directors and musicians,' Rehman said in her acceptance speech.\n\n'...Which is why I am sharing this award with all the departments of the film industry. They gave me a lot of respect, support and love from the very beginning. A film is not made by just one person, we need each other,' she added.\n\n'I'm elated to honour Waheeda Rehman ji with Dadasaheb Phalke award. I congratulate Waheeda ji. With her art and personality, she has reached on top in the film industry. She has made a name for herself as a woman of dignity, confidence and originality in her personal life too,' the President said.\n\nMurmu also spoke about how Rehman refused to change her name as a newcomer in the film industry when it was common for actors to opt for a different screen name.\n\n'In her movies, she played roles of women who broke shackles. Waheeda ji has set the example that women have to take the initiative when it comes to women empowerment,' she added.\n\nThe actor made her debut in Hindi films opposite Dev Anand in Guru Dutt's 1956 film 'CID' and went on to build a stellar career of over five decades, including classics Pyaasa, Kaagaz ke Phool and Chaudhvin Ka Chand, Guide as well as later hits such as Kabhi Kabhie and Khamoshi.\n\nShe received a National Film Award for her role as a clanswoman in Reshma aur Shera. She has already been honoured with a Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan.\n\nFilm actor-producer Devika Rani was the first Dadasaheb Phalke awardee. Other female artists to have received the honour are Sulochana, Kanan Devi, Durga Khote, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and Asha Parekh."
