Devika Rani was the inaugural recipient of this award, which she got at the 17th National Film Awards in 1969.\n\nDadasaheb Phalke is often regarded as the “Father of Indian Cinema.” In 1913, he directed India’s first full-length feature film, Raja Harishchandra. As a result, the Government of India established the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1969 to honor Dadasaheb Phalke.\n\nThe honorees have been recognized for their “great contribution to the growth and development of Indian film.” A group of distinguished figures from the Indian cinema industry selects the recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke award. The reward includes a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a Rs. 10 lakh cash prize.\n\nWinners of the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards in 2020\n\nS.No.AwardWinner1Best Playback Singer MaleArmaan Malik2Best Reality ShowBigg Boss 133Best Actor in Television SeriesDheeraj Dhoopar4Best Actress in TelevisionDivyanka Tripathi5Most Favourite Television ActorHarshad Chopda6Best ActorHrithik Roshan (Super 30)7Most Promising ActorKiccha Sudeep8Best Television SeriesKumkum Bhagya9Most Favourite Jodi in Television SeriesSriti Jha and Shabbir Ahluwalia (Kumkum Bhagya)10Best FilmSuper 30\n\nThis is the country’s highest formal distinction for cinema celebrities.
