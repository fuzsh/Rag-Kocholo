        "text": "By ABHISHEK KUMAR\n\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival 2023 was held in Mumbai recently, in which Varun Dhawan, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Rishabh Shetty, and the movie, The Kashmir Files, film were awarded in different categories.\n\nVivek Agnihotri, the director of the controversial film, tweeted that The Kashmir Files has received the best film award at the Dadasaheb Phalke Awards 2023. Vivek Agnihotri also used the hashtag #DadaSahebPhalkeAwards2023 in this tweet. This created confusion among netizens regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vivekagnihotri/status/1627883708362678275?t=hR-D3pLKXe3h3JIv6DJFCQ&s=19\n\nSeveral media outlets and social media users also pointed out that The Kashmir Files had received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. However, it is worth noting here that the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and Dadasaheb International Film Festival Award are two different awards.\n\nDifference between the two awards\n\nThe biggest difference between the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and the awards handed out by private organizations in his name is that the Dadasaheb Falke Award does not have different categories like best film, best actor, best actress, etc. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is given annually to only one individual who has made an outstanding contribution to the Indian film industry.\n\n-Dadasaheb Phalke Award\n\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke Award is the highest honour in the field of Indian cinema. The award was instituted by the Indian government in 1969 in the name of Dadasaheb Phalke, who directed India’s first full-length feature film Raja Harishchandra (1913), and is considered the father of Indian cinema for his outstanding contribution to the field. This honour is given at the National Film Awards ceremony held by the ministry of information and broadcasting’s directorate of film festivals. The awardee is selected by a committee consisting of eminent personalities from the Indian film industry. In this respect, a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medal, a shawl and a cash prize of Rs. 10 lahks are awarded to the winner. The most recent Dadasaheb Phalke Award was given to Indian actress, film director, and producer Asha Parekh in 2020. (The award was handed over to her only in 2022 because of the pandemic)"
