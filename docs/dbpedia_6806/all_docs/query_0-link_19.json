        "text": "Veteran Telugu film producer Dr Daggubbati Ramanaidu passed away into the ages on February 18.\n\nIn an interview he had granted Rediff.com in September 2010, he tells us how he started making movies.\n\nWe reproduce the interview here.\n\nDaggubati Ramanaidu has reached heights like no other film producer.\n\nNot only did the prolific filmmaker make it to the Guinness Book of World Records when he completed 101 films, his repertoire of 135 films includes films in more Indian languages than any other producer.\n\nAlong the way, Ramanaidu has also introduced several heroes, including his son Venkatesh, heroines (Vanisri, Tabu, Karisma Kapoor, Khushboo, Katrina Kaif, etc), directors and music directors.\n\nHe has worked with almost all the superstars of Indian cinema, including the late N T Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Jamuna, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajesh Khanna, Hema Malini, Rekha, Kamal Haasan, Rajnikanth, Chiranjeevi, Jeetendra, Sridevi, Jayaprada, Anil Kapoor and Kajol -- to name a few.\n\nThe prolific filmmaker is also a philanthropist, an ex-member of Parliament (1999-2004), and an occasional actor.\n\nThe last film where he did a substantial role was the Telugu film Hope which won a National Award.\n\nHe has now added another feather to his cap with a Dadasaheb Phalke award for his contribution to Indian cinema. The award includes a Swarna Kamal, a cash prize of Rs 10 lakh and a shawl.\n\nIn the midst of all the felicitations, the 74-year-old filmmaker took time out to share his journey from a village in Andhra Pradesh to India's highest honour in cinema with Radhika Rajamani/ Rediff.com.\n\n'I am very happy to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award'\n\nImage: A scene from Hope\n\nI am very happy to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award; it is for life. It is prestigious and special.\n\nOnly five people from Andhra Pradesh have got this award.\n\nI have got it 20 years after Nageswara Raogaaru (a Telugu honorific) got it in 1990. I was in Araku (near Visakhapatnam), busy with my next Telugu film Alasyam Amrutham, when my people told me about the news being aired on television.\n\nI spoke to my sons and the elder one, Suresh, told me he had been receiving phone calls and that I should come down to Hyderabad. I distributed sweets among my staff and left Araku to catch the 7.20 pm flight from Vizag to Hyderabad.\n\n'I was not happy with the rice business'\n\nImage: Ramanaidu (second from left) with son Suresh Babu (left), wife Rajeswari, daughter Lakshmi and son Venkatesh\n\nI was born in Karamchedu, (Andhra Pradesh's Prakasam district).\n\nAt the age of nine, I donated land to Vinobha Bhave for his Bhoodan movement. If I had not given my father's land, I would have given my mother's. I grew up to become an agriculturist, who had a rice mill and a transport business.\n\nMeanwhile, my father partnered with a relative in the production of an ANR (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and Savitri starrer, Nammina Bantu. For the film, ANR drove a cart with our bullocks. I was active in the shoot, so ANR asked me to join films. I refused. But I was not happy with the rice business.\n\nIn 1962, I closed down the business, went to Chennai and stayed in my uncle's house. I thought of doing business in bricks. Since the red soil in Aminjikarai (in central Chennai) was not conducive for bricks, I contemplated getting into real estate. Then my uncle took me to Andhra Club, which was visited by all the Telugu artistes/directors. That set my entry into films.\n\nI began with Anuragam directed by Ramineedu in 1963. I established Suresh Productions and produced Ramudu Bheemudu, starring the late NTR and Jamuna under this banner the next year.\n\n'I have introduced 11 heroines, four heroes, 23 directors and four music directors so far'\n\nImage: Ramanaidu with Kamal Haasan\n\nI made many films like Pratigna Palana (Kantha Rao, Rajasree), Sri Krishna Tulabharam (NTR and Jamuna), Sthree Janma (NTR, Krishna Kumari), Papa Kosam (Jaggaiah, Devika), Bommalu Cheppina Katha (Kantha Rao, Vijayanirmala), Sepoy Chinnaiah (ANR, KR Vijaya), Drohi (Jaggaiah, Vanisri) before Prema Nagar (ANR, Vanisri) in 1971.\n\nIt was a blockbuster, and I produced the remakes in Tamil (Vasantha Maligai, starring Sivaji Ganesan and Vanisri) and Hindi (Prem Nagar, starring Rajesh Khanna and Hema Malini).\n\nAs it was made in three languages, I came to be known all over India.\n\nThen I thought of making films in other languages too. Suresh Productions has produced films in 13 languages (including English). My Bengali film Asukh, directed by Rituparno Ghosh, won an award too. My films in other Indian languages include Dharma Devtha (Oriya); Maina Mor Duniya (Assamese); Maduve Agona Baa and Thavarumane Udugore (Kannada); Namma Kuzhaindagal, Tirumangalyam,Madhurageetham, Kuzhaindaikaga and Deiva Piravi (Tamil); Ashwaroodhan (Malayalam); Mazi Aai (Marathi) and Shiva (Bhojpuri).\n\nMy well-known Hindi films include Dildar, Tohfa, Anari, Rakhwala, Taqdeerwala, Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, Aaghaaz to name a few. I am starting my Punjabi film shortly.\n\nI have also introduced 11 heroines, four heroes, 23 directors and four music directors so far.\n\n'Right from my village days, I had the desire to be at the top'\n\nImage: Ramanaidu on the sets\n\nFrom the beginning, right from my village days, I had the desire to be at the top. I wanted to be number one in agriculture, get more paddy than others... So when I came into films, I wanted to be the number one here too.\n\nI don't think of doing harm to anyone. I am sincere in my work.\n\nI get totally involved in production. For me, production is a business. Business is business; one should not mix pleasure in making movies.\n\nAlso, there should be no personal interference in casting. One should cast actors according to the role.\n\nA producer must have control over the script and should plan properly. He must know the next day's shooting schedules. Even today, after the day's shoot, I go through the day's accounts, expenditure, etc, including how many people (technicians and others) are there on the sets.\n\nOne has to be alert. I know no other business but filmmaking now. There is bound to be success and failure; one must tackle both.\n\n'I want to be simple and nice to everyone, from the spot boys and technicians to the top stars'\n\nImage: D Ramanaidu (third from left)\n\nI have not had any problems. I am sincere to my work. I give respect. I want to be simple and nice to everyone, from the spot boys and technicians to the top stars.\n\n'I wanted a place where the producer could come in with a script and go out with the first copy of the film'\n\nImage: D Ramanaidu (centre)\n\nWhen I was in Madras, I used to use Nagi Reddy's Vahini Studios. I even jointly produced with his sons.\n\nI started Ramanaidu Studios on a site given by the Andhra Pradesh government.\n\nI wanted a place where the producer could come in with a script and go out with the first copy of the film. So, I set up recording theatres, dubbing theatres, colour and black and white labs -- everything required for filmmaking.\n\nI am also setting up a studio in Vizag. I have also entered distribution with Suresh Movies Film Distributors.\n\nWe come from films, so one must do something for films. I started a film school first, followed by an acting school at Ramanaidu Studios, as I wanted to create young directors and artists.\n\n'I don't want to enter politics again; I do not fit in'\n\nImage: D Ramanaidu\n\nI was an MP for one term. I did whatever I could for the constituency, including donations for charitable ventures like an eye hospital and indoor stadium (Karamchedu village), lift irrigation, etc. I don't want to enter politics again; I do not fit in.\n\n'I am happy that the whole family is into films'\n\nImage: D Ramanaidu with his family\n\nI got married in 1958. I am very happy to be with my family; they are my priority.\n\nI feel the house is a temple and the wife is a devata (goddess). I am very fortunate that I have two sons, one daughter and eight grandchildren.\n\nSuresh is into production, while Venkatesh is a hero. My grandsons Naga Chaitanya and Rana are also into films. I am happy that the whole family is into films.\n\nAdvice to upcoming producers\n\nBe sincere to your work and plan properly."
