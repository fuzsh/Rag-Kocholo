His elder son Suresh took over the business. His another son Venkatesh is a Telugu actor.\n\nRamanaidu was conferred with Dada Saheb Phalke Award in 2009 and Padmabhushan in 2012. He introduced about 25 directors to the film industry.\n\nHe represented the Bapatla Lok Sabha constituency for Telugu Desam Party. He, however, kept away from politics for the last few years.\n\nHe expanded his film business by setting up a studio in Visakhapatnam.\n\nFilm actors Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Rajasekhar and several others from the film industry paid tributes to the departed producer and consoled his family members.\n\nChief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, N Chandrababu Naidu and K Chandrasekhara Rao, mourned Ramanaidu's death."
