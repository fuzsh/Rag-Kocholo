        "text": "The Dadasaheb Phalke award for 2020 has been given to Asha Parekh, a renowned actress, becoming the 52nd winner of the distinction. Anurag Thakur, the Union Minister for Broadcasting and Information, revealed her identity. She participated in over 95 films, and from 1998 to 2001; she served as chair of the Central Board of Film Certification. The Indian government also gave her the Padma Shri in 1992 for her contributions to cinema.\n\nOn October 2, 1942, in Mumbai, Asha Parekh was born into a middle-class Gujarati Jain family. Her mother was a Dawoodi Bohra Muslim, and her father was from Paldi, a town close to Pirana in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. In Parekh’s religious upbringing, Sai Baba was worshipped. She began taking Indian classical dancing lessons at a young age, thanks to her mother, who also trained her under Pandit Bansilal Bharati.\n\nParekh claims that her reputation as being difficult to approach has prevented others from approaching her about marriage, which is why she has remained single. Rumours circulated that she was having a love relationship with her married director Nasir Hussain. In her later years, Parekh acknowledged having a long-term partner but chose not to go into further detail other than to say that the relationship was enjoyable while it lasted. She claimed that Nasir Hussain had become reclusive after the death of his wife. However, she had spoken to him the day before he passed away in 2002.\n\nAnurag Singh Thakur, the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, announced the honour for the actress on Twitter. He tweeted, “Honoured to announce that Asha Parekh ji would receive recognition and an award from the Dadasaheb Phalke Selection Jury for her outstanding lifelong contribution to Indian cinema.” At the 68th National Film Awards ceremony on Sept 30, President Droupadi Murmu will present the honour to Parekh, 79. A five-person panel made up of Asha Bhosle, Udit Narayan, Hema Malini, T S Nagabharana, and Poonam Dhillon decided whether to propose awarding Parekh the Dadasaheb Phalke Award."
