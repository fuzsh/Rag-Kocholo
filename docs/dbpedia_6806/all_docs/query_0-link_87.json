        "text": "Multilingual Indian film producer Daggubati Ramanaidu (D Rama Naidu) passed away in Hyderabad on Wednesday afternoon, 18 February after a long battle with cancer.\n\nSee Rama Naidu's Rare and Unseen Pictures\n\nIn January 2014, reports emerged that Daggubati Ramanaidu was suffering from prostate cancer and he was undergoing treatment for it at a private hospital in Hyderabad. Sadly, the filmmaker succumbed to it. He was 78 and is survived by sons Suresh Babu, Venkatesh and grandson Rana.\n\nBorn in Karamchedu in Andhra Pradesh on 6 June 1936, Rama Naidu took up several odd jobs such as rice mill business and bus transport business in Karamchedu before getting into the film industry. His interests shifted to films when someone from his area started Shambu Films, a production agency. He got acquainted with late legendary actor Akkineni Nageshwara Rao as he started looking after on-set shoot arrangements.\n\nAfter getting acquainted with few other actors, Rama Naidu started Suresh Productions with his childhood friends G Rajendra Prasad and Subba Rao and produced \"Raamudu Bheemudu\" in 1964. It was a tremendous hit at the box office. Then onwards, there was no look back for this filmmaker.\n\nLater, Rama Naidu produced and directed many movies in Telugu and he churned out several blockbuster films. He also produced and directed movies in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi and English. Probably, he is the only filmmaker in Indian cinema to work in so many languages.\n\nThe filmmaker, who produced 150 films in 13 Indian languages, held the Guinness Record for the maximum number of films produced by an individual. In 2012, he was conferred with the Padma Bhushan in recognition for his contribution to Telugu cinema. In 2009, he received the Dada Saheb Phalke Award for Lifetime Achievement in the film industry for his outstanding contribution.\n\nRama Naidu also served as a member of parliament for the Bapatala constituency of Guntur District in the 13th Lok Sabha from 1999â€“2004. He had contributed a substantial part of his earnings to numerous philanthropic purposes including the Ramanaidu Charitable Trust that was founded in 1991.\n\nHis death has shocked many across the globe. Soon after the news of his sudden demise broke out, many of his fans took to their Twitter pages and offered prayers to his departed soul and expressed condolences to his family\n\nNikhil Siddhartha: The Great Man is no more...
