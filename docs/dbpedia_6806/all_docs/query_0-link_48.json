It is a shame that not much is known about the Dada Saheb Phalke award winner, who was born in Karimnagar District in 1909. As per the article below, Jayaraj acted in more than 170 Hindi films after debuting through “Jagamani Jawaani” (silent movie) but he was never involved in any Telugu movie during his career. Now that the state is divided, P. Jayaraj, will, technically become the first person from Telangana to win the most prestigious award of Indian Cinema.\n\nList of Telugus who have won the award : 6 people from the Two Telugu speaking states have won the award so far. This is the second biggest representation from a vernacular after Bengali."
