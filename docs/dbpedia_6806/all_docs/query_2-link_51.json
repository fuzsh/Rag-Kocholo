        "text": "In a recent flurry of excitement, names like Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee lit up headlines as winners at the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival (DPIFF) Awards.\n\nBut hold your applause, folks! While these recognitions are significant, they are not confused with the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award – the highest honor in Indian cinema.\n\nHow is DPIFF Different From the Dadasaheb Phalke Awards?\n\nDPIFF Awards, though commendable in their own right, are separate from the revered Dadasaheb Phalke Award. The former, established in 2012 and officially recognized in 2016, aims to celebrate excellence in cinema on an international platform.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, instituted in 1969, is bestowed annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals under the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, honoring one outstanding contributor to Indian cinema each year.\n\nWho won the DPIFF Awards in 2024?\n\nHere’s the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards full winners’ list (films)\n\n*Best Actor: Shah Rukh Khan (Jawan) *\n\nBest Actress: Rani Mukerji (Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway)\n\n*Best Film: Jawan\n\n*Best Director: Sandeep Reddy Vanga (Animal)\n\n*Best Actor (Critics): Vicky Kaushal (Sam Bahadur)\n\n*Best Actress (Critics): Kareena Kapoor (Jaane Jaan)\n\n*Best Film (Critics): 12th Fail\n\n*Best Director (Critics): Atlee (Jawan)\n\n*Best Actor in a Negative Role: Bobby Deol (Animal)\n\n*Best Actress in a Comic Role: Sanya Malhotra (Kathal)\n\n*Best Actor in a Comic Role: Ayushmann Khurranna (Dream Girl 2)\n\n*Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Anil Kapoor (Animal)\n\n*Best Actress in a Supporting Role: Dimple Kapadia (Pathaan)\n\n*Most Versatile Actress: Nayanthara\n\n*Most Promising Actor: Vikrant Massey (12th Fail)\n\n*Most Promising Actress: Adah Sharma (The Kerala Story)\n\n*Best Music Director: Anirudh Ravichander (Jawan)\n\n*Best Playback Singer (Male): Varun Jain and Sachin Jigar (“Tere Vaste”)\n\n*Best Playback Singer (Female): Shilpa Rao (“Besharam Rang”)\n\n*Best Lyricist: Javed Akhtar (“Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se”)\n\n*Best Short Film: Good morning\n\n*Best International Feature Film: Oppenheimer\n\nSo, while Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s “Animal” and Shah Rukh Khan’s “Jawan” may have clinched top spots at the DPIFF Awards, they haven’t earned the esteemed Dadasaheb Phalke Award. It’s crucial to distinguish between the two to avoid misconceptions and uphold the integrity of these prestigious accolades.\n\nRead More – Varun Dhawan Announces Wife Natasha Dalal’s Pregnancy. See Fans Reaction\n\nIndian Media’s Big Goof-Up on DPIFF vs Dadasaheb Phalke Award Confusion\n\nBut where does this confusion stem from? Unfortunately, some media outlets have muddled the distinction by referring to the DPIFF Awards simply as “Dadasaheb Phalke Awards” in their coverage. This oversight has led to widespread misinterpretation and misinformation, with many incorrectly associating the DPIFF Awards with the iconic Dadasaheb Phalke Award.\n\nAmong those news organizations that did not clarify during their coverage that the awards were not the annual government awards were Hindustan Times and India Today.\n\nHere’s how they covered the event:\n\nAccording to the website, the awards were established by entrepreneur Anil Mishra. However, his IMDb profile cites him as an ‘advisory board member of CBFC’; his name is not currently listed on the CBFC website. Additionally, the website lists several prominent figures such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, former President Ram Nath Kovind, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla as “well-wishers.”\n\nAmit Shah’s letter extending good wishes for the 2023 Awards is also showcased on the website. The awards are purportedly chaired by Chandrasekhar Pusalkar, who is identified as Dadasaheb Phalke’s grandson. DPIFF asserts that the awards are “supported by” the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya, which was inaugurated in 2022.\n\nAs we navigate the dynamic landscape of Indian cinema, we must uphold accuracy and transparency in our reporting. While the DPIFF Awards are a commendable platform for recognizing talent, they do not replace or equate to the venerable Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Let’s celebrate achievements with clarity and distinction, honoring the legacy of these esteemed accolades."
