        "text": "HYDERABAD:Legendary filmmaker and Dadasaheb Phalke Award recipient Daggubati Ramanaidu breathed his last after a prolonged battle with prostate cancer here on Wednesday.\n\nThe movie moghul, who produced about 155 films in several languages, is survived by two sons, actor Venkatesh and producer Suresh Babu, and daughter Lakshmi. He was 78.\n\nBorn at Karamchedu in Andhra Pradesh on June 6, 1936, Ramanaidu began his career as a businessman, running a rice mill and buses, before entering the world of cinema. After working for sometime in a production agency, he floated his own banner, Suresh Productions, in collaboration with his childhood friends G Rajendra Prasad and Subba Rao.\n\nHe made his first film Anuragam in 1963. Success came his way the next year through Ramudu Bheemudu, starring legendary actor N T Rama Rao.\n\nRamanaidu holds the Guinness Book record of producing the maximum number of films in Indian cinema - in a career spanning over five decades, he produced 155 films in 15 different languages, including Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Odia, Assamese, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi and Bhojpuri.\n\nIn 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. Earlier, in 2009, he received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for Lifetime Achievement."
