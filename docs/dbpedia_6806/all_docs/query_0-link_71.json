        "text": "The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in the field of cinema. It is presented annually at the National Film Awards ceremony by the Directorate of Film Festivals, an organisation set up by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The recipient is honoured for their \"great and outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian cinema\"[1] and is selected by a committee consisting of eminent personalities from the Indian film industry.[2] The award comprises a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹1,000,000 (US$12,000).[3]\n\nPresented first in 1969, the award was introduced by the Government of India to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's contribution to Indian cinema.[4] Phalke (1870–1944), who is popularly known as and often regarded as \"the father of Indian cinema\", was an Indian filmmaker who directed India's first full-length feature film, Raja Harishchandra (1913).[1]\n\nThe first recipient of the award was actress Devika Rani, who was honoured at the 17th National Film Awards. As of 2023, there have been 53 awardees. Among those, actor Prithviraj Kapoor (1971) and actor Vinod Khanna (2017) are the only posthumous recipients.[5] Kapoor's actor-filmmaker son, Raj Kapoor, accepted the award on his behalf at the 19th National Film Awards in 1971 and was also himself a recipient in 1987 at the 35th National Film Awards ceremony.[6][7][lower-alpha 1]"
