        "text": "Bollywood's legendary actress Waheeda Rehman has been named as the recipient of the 2021 Dadasaheb Phalke Award. The news was announced by Anurag Thakur, the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, on X Tuesday. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is given by the Indian government to cine artists for their lifetime contribution to cinema.\n\nWaheeda Rehman is one of Hindi cinema's most renowned leading ladies who has worked in classics like Guide, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Pyaasa, and Chaudhvin Ka Chaand. Her accolades include the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri. She also won a National Award for her work in Reshma Aur Shera.\n\nIn a post on X, Anurag Thakur wrote: \"I feel an immense sense of happiness and honour in announcing that Waheeda Rehman ji is being bestowed with the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Lifetime Achievement Award this year for her stellar contribution to Indian Cinema. Waheeda ji has been critically acclaimed for her roles in Hindi films, prominent among them, Pyaasa, Kaagaz ke Phool, Chaudhavi Ka Chand, Saheb Biwi Aur Ghulam, Guide, Khamoshi and several others.\"\n\n\"In her career spanning over 5 decades, she has essayed her roles with extreme finesse, leading to a National Film Award for her role as a clanswoman in the film Reshma Aur Shera. A Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awardee, Waheeda ji has exemplified dedication, commitment and the strength of a Bharatiya Nari who can achieve the highest level of professional excellence with her hardwork.\n\n\"At a time when the historic Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam has been passed by Parliament, her being awarded with this lifetime achievement award is a fitting tribute to one of the leading ladies of Indian Cinema and one who has dedicated her life after films to philanthropy and the greater good of society. I congratulate her and humbly pay my regards to her rich body of work that is an intrinsic part of our film history.\"\n\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke Award announcement comes on the occasion of Dev Anand's centenary. Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman featured in several films together, including the iconic Guide in 1965. Dev Anand had received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2002."
