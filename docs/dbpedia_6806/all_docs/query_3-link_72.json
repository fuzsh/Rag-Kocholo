Upon receiving the award, the actress thanked the Bollywood industry for playing a catalyst in her film journey. In her thank you speech, the actress said, \"I feel honoured and very humbled. But today where I stand, it's all because of the lovely industry I have been a part of. Luckily, I got an opportunity to work with top directors, producers, filmmakers, technicians and music directors, who supported me and showered me with lots of love and respect.\"\n\nWaheeda Rehman continued, \"Lastly makeup artists, hair and costume designers also deserve a special mention. Hence I want to share this award with all departments of the film industry.
