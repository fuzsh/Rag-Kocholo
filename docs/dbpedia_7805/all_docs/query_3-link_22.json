        "text": "Jay Saunders Supporter\n\nJesuits, like so many false Christianities, have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. Meaning they live with and preach a concept of works righteousness. We can not work our way into to heaven, and no religious sect, church or denomination can get us there, not even your godly grandmother. We are justified by faith in the saving grace of Jesus Christ and in him alone can we obtain the righteousness of Jesus Christ through faith in that name. We must be born again. By obtaining salvation through and by Jesus Christ he becomes our propitiation. Propitiation means that his blood is washing our confessed sins habitually or continuously. We become righteous by faith in the propitiation that is ongoing for anyone who puts their faith in Jesus Christ by making and calling him Lord. Holiness is a heart that is circumcised by faith in that name. Jesus Christ our high priest, our God, our Savior, our Lord and King. His word washes and cleanses us. His word, the Father the Holy Spirit and we ourselves become one through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nLawrence wong Supporter Disciple of iEsou (\"Yeh-sou\") christou\n\nThe Jesuit Order, otherwise known as the Society of Jesus (S.J.), is the military enforcement arm of the Catholic Church. On the Jesuit flag is written the words, IUSTUM, NECAR, REGES, IMPIOS or, \"It is just to exterminate or annihilate impious or heretical kings, governments, or rulers.\" Source: http://www.thenazareneway.com/inri_the_inscription_explained.htm The Council of Trent in the mid 1500’s was convened by the Catholics to combat the demands for Reform of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council appointed the Jesuits to solve the problem. The Jesuit Order was responsible for the various Inquisitions beginning in Spain prior to this. The Jesuits met the challenge with the sword murdering thousands upon thousands, coupled with a huge propaganda campaign. They also started the training of Jesuit Priests in by establishing Universities to have Jesuits Priests highly trained to infiltrate the Protestant Churches, Bible translation societies, universities and the whole world. They were feared as “vicious double agents to control the world through: The City of London (financial centre of the world) located in a defined area in Greater London; Washington DC (the mightiest army, navy and air force CIA and FBI the world has ever seen; and Vatican City (The Holy See) in Rome (the most powerful government in the world).
