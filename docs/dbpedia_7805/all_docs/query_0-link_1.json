        "text": "The IHS monogram used by the Jesuits is an abbreviation for the name of Jesus in Greek: IHSOUS. Originally and on many icons the final letter is the Greek form of sigma used at the end of a word, IHC, but eventually the more familiar Roman S came into use. Normally a line is drawn above the three letters (as on the crest of Geneva below) to indicate that it is an abbreviation. In northern France small Roman letters were used (ihs) and the line was drawn through the h to form a cross. Such an inscription was above the door of the College of St. Barbara at the University of Paris where Ignatius would often have seen it. When the monogram went back to capital letters, people were unwilling to loose the cross and so mounted a cross on the horizontal stroke of the H. The stamp above shows St. John Capistrano (1385-1456) preaching devotion to the name of Jesus, as did his master St. Bernardino of Siena (1380-1444) with the IHS on a banner. On the Church of St. Michael in Vilnius (below), is what looks like the seal of the Society, but it is a reference to St. Bernadino since the church was built for Bernardine (Franciscan) nuns.\n\nUSSR, 9 Feb 1976, postal stationery shows (in blue) St. Michael's Church (Museum of Architecture), Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\nThough IHS seal is identical with that of the Jesuits, it actually refers to the Bernadine tradition of the church and attached convent.\n\nBELGIUM, 1948, it appears beside the Old English Chapel at Chevremont, Scott B453\n\nARGENTINA, 1964, at the top of the National University of Cordoba arms, Scott 764\n\nPORTUGAL, 1970, on a Portuguese-Japanese commemorative stamp, Scott 1074\n\nJAPAN, 1993, on a tea caddy or host box, Scott 2212\n\nPortugal observed Expo 1970 with symbols of Portuguese-Japanese relationship.

The stamp mentions the date 1549 when Jesuits first went to Japan, and includes the seal of the Society of Jesus, the IHS monogram of Jesus between cross and nails surrounded by a sunburst 혰 the same seal embossed on the background of this website.\n\nJapan later included in a set marking Portuguese-Japanese relations what seems to be a natsume, a tea caddy to hold the powered green tea used in the tea ceremony. Scott describes it as a mother-of-pearl box to hold wafers used at the Eucharist, and the top of it is adorned with seal of the Society of Jesus.\n\nMACAO, 2000, on October 31 a mini-sheet celebrating Chinese & Portuguese Ceramics\n\nfeaturing the IHS with cross and nails on the top left stamp, Scott 1037\n\nIt appears twice on this se-tenant pair honoring The Jesuit Block and the Estancias of C처rdoba as well as on the title page illustrated on the label.\n\nARGENTINA, 2001, Scott 2160\n\nSPAIN, 2003, the Holy Year issue, Scott 3236\n\nThe stamp shows the reliquary containing the miraculous True Cross of Caravaca with the Society's emblem\n\nMACAO, 2006, the Society of Jesus series, Fr.
