        "text": "Practice framework\n\nBehind the practice framework and its description of how we work at Jesuit Social Services lies a distinctive view of the world that we share. It sees each human being as precious and so as demanding respect.\n\nIn this view each human being is defined by their relationships to others and to the world. No person is self-made but depends on other people in order to flourish. It follows that we are responsible to one another in all that we do, and particularly to the most vulnerable people in our society. Our responsibility does not stop with our personal relationship. It recognises the interconnectedness of environmental and social justice and extends to building a society in which people, and especially the most vulnerable, are respected, and in which all have a place at the table. We are also committed to develop the same respectful relationships with one another as with the people whom we serve, and to embed them in our processes.\n\nThis view of the world and of our relationships flows out of the Christian and Ignatian tradition which we inherit at Jesuit Social Services. It also comes out of the more recent secular tradition with its emphasis on human rights, free will and the innate desire for growth.\n\nDownload a copy of our Foundation Document.\n\nOur origins as Jesuit Social Services\n\nJesuit Social Services’ origins date back to 1977, when we opened a small hostel called Four Flats for young men after their release from youth justice centres and prisons.\n\nThis program was later named Brosnan Youth Services after Father John Brosnan, who was Chaplain at Pentridge Prison for 30 years.\n\nIn 1995, Jesuit Social Services was established incorporating Brosnan Youth Services and including new services that grew out of our experience engaging with disadvantaged young people.\n\nThese services included Connexions, Victoria’s first dual diagnosis program for young people with co-existing mental health and substance use problems.\n\nIn 2007, at the time of our thirtieth anniversary, we accepted a request by the Provincial of the Australian Jesuits to become a national lead agency for the Province in the field of social justice.\n\nFollowing this we extended our services and advocacy to New South Wales and the Northern Territory.\n\nToday we work in some of the most difficult and demanding areas of human service, including crime, addiction, mental illness, suicide bereavement, long-term unemployment and entrenched social disadvantage.\n\nOur Jesuit heritage\n\nThe Jesuits (also known as the Society of Jesus) are an international body of priests and brothers within the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Jesuits were established in 1540 by St Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nIgnatius was a Spanish solider and aristocrat, whose military career was ended when a cannon ball shattered his leg.\n\nWhile recovering, Ignatius read about the life of Jesus and the lives of the saints and decided to dedicate himself to God.\n\nSo began a life of pilgrimage – though not without hardship. Drawing on personal experiences of desolation and consolation, he developed his meditations on the love of God – which would become his Spiritual Exercises.\n\nIgnatius was imprisoned a number of times by the Spanish Inquisition for teaching people about the love of God, without having what was regarded as the appropriate qualifications.\n\nIgnatius then sought formal training in theology and in 1528 Ignatius enrolled in the University of Paris where he drew together a group of companions.\n\nRather than living in monasteries, Ignatius of Loyola instructed the Jesuits to:\n\nlive and move in the world\n\nbe contemplative in action\n\nshow love in deeds rather than words\n\nfind God in all things.\n\nIn this way of proceeding, the Jesuits differed from earlier religious institutes in the Catholic Church."
