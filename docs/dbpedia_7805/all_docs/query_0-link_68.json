        "text": "🚶♀️🚶♂️ Jesuit Mission Australia's ongoing One Foot Raised campaign has already raised over $54,000 for Myanmar! In the week coinciding with the feast day of St Ignatius of Loyola (31st July), Australian Catholics of all ages (VIC, NSW and SA) participated to raise awareness, prayers and funds for the people of Myanmar. A number of Australian Jesuit schools, parishes and ministries participated, including Saint Ignatius' College Riverview (NSW), Our Lady of the Way Parish North Sydney (NSW), The Cardoner Network (NSW), Saint Ignatius College Geelong (VIC), JISA Sevenhill and Riverton Parishes (SA). Additionally, Xavier College, Kew (VIC) will undertake One Foot Raised later in the year. It's not too late to make a meaningful difference and support this great cause. Jesuit Mission is hoping to raise $75,000 this year!

In the summer of 2022, he rode about 700 kms interstate, from Warrnambool to Adelaide. He says: “When things are going well, the legs go round, crossing the countryside and finding the space; that is God’s joy.” Find out more: 👉 https://lnkd.in/gegqMJhw Photo courtesy of Fr Iain Radvan SJ #jesuits #societyofjesus #jesuit\n\n🛑⚠️ Safeguarding delegates from the provinces and regions in the Jesuit Conference Asia Pacific (JCAP) met in Bali, Indonesia last month.

Barbara Watkins (pictured right), Executive Director, Jesuit Education Australasia, cites the importance of the depth of reflection and discussion. “This, coupled with the connections we made with the very rich and diverse Jesuit community around the world was truly exceptional, as was the passion with which those gathered entered into their roles and the calling that we shared.“ Find out more: 👉 https://lnkd.in/gzMgsefJ Photo courtesy of Barbara Watkins. #jesuits #societyofjesus #jesuit\n\n🍇👣 Sevenhill Cellars, established in 1851, has received a South Australian tourism grant to support the digitalisation of the Heritage Walking Trail at its historic property.
