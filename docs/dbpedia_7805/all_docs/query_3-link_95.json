        "text": "Context: Social/Cultural World of Jesus\n\nPolitical dimension\n\nJesus lived in Jewish Palestine in the first century. This is the historical/cultural/social context in which he must be understood.\n\nAt that time, Palestine was part of the Roman empire, under the domination of a foreign empire.\n\nRome ruled indirectly:\n\nGalilee:\n\nIn the north\n\nRuled by Herod Antipas (son of Herod the Great)\n\nHerod owed his appointment to Rome\n\nJudea:\n\nIn the south\n\nRuled by a circle of the Jewish aristocratic elite\n\nThese elite collaborated with the Roman government\n\nThis domination system was marked by:\n\nPeasant Society\n\nPurity Society\n\nPatriarchal Society\n\nPeasant Society\n\nPeasant society refers to a pre-industrial agrarian society where:\n\nPeasant agricultural production is the only real source of wealth\n\nThere is no manufacturing\n\nThere is no industry except small scale handcrafts\n\nPeasant societies are marked by an enormous gulf between rural peasants and urban ruling elites.\n\nThe urban ruling elites (king, aristocratic families, high government officials) and retainers (servants, army, lower government officials, religious officials):\n\nComprise 10% of population\n\nExtract 66% of the value of rural production through:\n\nTaxation: civil and religious (tithes are taxes on agricultural produce to be paid to the temple authorities)\n\nLand rent: direct payment or sharecropping\n\nAre enormously wealthy in the standards of the day\n\nDon’t produce anything and hardly provide any services except an army for warfare\n\nPeasant society was politically oppressive, economically exploitative, and religiously legitimated.\n\nPurity System\n\nThe central social structure of the society was organized with purity as the core value. Purity systems generate a class of untouchables and outcasts.\n\nPurity was the core value structuring the society:\n\nPurity was not an individual virtue\n\nPurity was political\n\nIt was the ideology of the temple elites\n\nThe Jerusalem temple was geographically and symbolically the center of the purity system\n\nIn general the pure/impure or clean/unclean social structure got attached to other central contrasts:\n\nPure Impure clean unclean righteous outcasts, sinners\n\n(sin is a matter of being unclean, not behavior) male\n\n(generally but not automatically pure) female\n\n(automatically impure) rich\n\n(generally but not automatically pure) poor\n\n(conventional wisdom said the poor hadn't lived right) Jew\n\n(generally but not automatically pure) gentile\n\n(impure by definition) well/healthy/whole ill/maimed/diseased\n\n(social meaning of being impure) agricultural produce on which taxes were paid agricultural produce on which taxes were not paid (declared unclean, boycotted by the righteous)\n\nThe purity system creates a society with very sharp social boundaries.\n\nThe temple elites were also the economic elites and the purity elites.\n\nPatriarchal Society\n\nPatriarchal society is:\n\nMale dominated\n\nHierarchical\n\nMirrored in the family structure\n\nIt is crucial to see the centrality of the temple and the temple aristocracy in the whole system because of the centrality of the temple in the world of Jesus’ life.\n\nQuestions to ponder...\n\nDomination systems, such as that in Jesus’ lifetime, exist today.\n\nWhat are some domination systems you know about or have experienced?\n\nJesus as Social Prophet\n\nJesus stands in the tradition of the prophets of Israel who criticized their culture in the name of God and became voices of an alternative consciousness."
