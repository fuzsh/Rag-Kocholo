        "text": "The Jesuit School of Theology, located in Berkeley, California, is an international center for the study of theology, faithful to the intellectual tradition of the Society of Jesus. JST provides students the opportunity to faithfully and critically engage the two thousand year tradition of Christianity through approaches grounded in the 21st century, the Church’s global context, and our Jesuit identity. Our faculty are committed to providing a Jesuit education grounded in an engaged pedagogy for the formation of leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion.\n\nKelly Miguens\n\nAfter working for two years in campus ministry at a Jesuit university, Kelly desired to grow spiritually and professionally. At JST, she found top-notch academics, a welcoming community, and a field experience that challenged her to grow as a minister.\n\nDaniel Valcazar\n\nDaniel shares that participating in the 19th Annotation, St. Ignatius’ Spiritual Exercises, led him to JST. By following his desire to do good in the world, Daniel arrived at JST and found a diverse community that also held this deep-seeded desire to be a force of love, compassion, and change."
