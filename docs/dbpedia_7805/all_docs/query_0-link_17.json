        "text": "Oval glass-fronted metal theca housing a second-class ex veste (of the vestment) relic of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The relic is affixed to a red silk background surrounded by silver wire ornamentation and identified in Latin on a manuscript cedula label as Veste S. Jgnatii Loyol. ([from] the vestment of St. Ignatius of Loyola). On the back, the theca is secured by a seal of red Spanish wax with an imprint of a coat of arms of Fr. Ferdinando Minucci (†1856), Archbishop of Florence (1828-1856).\n\nSaint Ignatius of Loyola (†1556) was a Spanish Basque priest and theologian, who founded the religious order called the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and became its first Superior General. Ignatius was beatified in 1609, and then canonized, receiving the title of Saint on March 12, 1622. His feast day is celebrated on July 31. He is the patron saint of the Basque provinces of Gipuzkoa and Biscay as well as the Society of Jesus and was declared the patron saint of all spiritual retreats by Pope Pius XI in 1922. Ignatius is also a foremost patron saint of soldiers."
