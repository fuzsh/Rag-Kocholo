The order has been regarded by many as the principal agent of the Counter-Reformation and was later a leading force in modernizing the church.\n\nFounding of the order\n\nThe order grew out of the activity of Ignatius, a Spanish soldier who experienced a religious conversion during a period of convalescence from a wound received in battle. After a period of intense prayer, he composed the Spiritual Exercises, a guidebook to convert the heart and mind to a closer following of Jesus Christ. On August 15, 1534, in Paris, six young men who had met him at the University of Paris and made a retreat according to the Spiritual Exercises joined him in vows of poverty, chastity, and a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. If this last promise did not prove possible, as it did not, they vowed to accept any apostolic work requested by the pope. In 1539 Ignatius drafted the first outline of the order’s organization, which Pope Paul III approved on September 27, 1540.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nSt. Ignatius of Loyola: Founding of the Jesuit order\n\nThe society introduced several innovations in the form of the religious life. Among these were the discontinuance of many medieval practices—such as regular penances or fasts obligatory on all, a common uniform, and the choral recitation of the liturgical office—in the interest of greater mobility and adaptability. Other innovations included a highly centralized form of authority with life tenure for the head of the order, probation lasting many years before final vows, gradation of members, and lack of a female branch. Particular emphasis was laid upon the virtue of obedience, including special obedience to the pope. Emphasis was also placed upon flexibility, a condition that allowed Jesuits to become involved in a great variety of ministries and missionary endeavors in all parts of the world.\n\nGrowth of the order\n\nThe society grew rapidly, and it quickly assumed a prominent role in the Counter-Reformation defense and revival of Catholicism. Almost from the beginning, education and scholarship became the society’s principal work. The early Jesuits, however, also produced preachers and catechists who devoted themselves to the care of the young, the sick, prisoners, prostitutes, and soldiers; they also were often called upon to undertake the controversial task of confessor to many of the royal and ruling families of Europe. The society entered the foreign mission field within months of its founding as Ignatius sent St. Francis Xavier, his most gifted companion, and three others to the East. More Jesuits were to be involved in missionary work than in any other activity, save education. By the time of Ignatius’s death in 1556, about 1,000 Jesuits were working throughout Europe and in Asia, Africa, and the New World. By 1626 the number of Jesuits was 15,544, and in 1749 the total was 22,589.\n\n(Read “To All Nations: 8 Fascinating Jesuit Missionaries.”)\n\nMatteo Ricci and the Chinese rites controversy\n\nThe society encountered an important controversy centered on the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci, who worked as a missionary in China in the late 16th and the early 17th century. Decades of scholarly research into Buddhist and Confucian thought had prepared Ricci to attach the Roman Catholic understanding of the Christian faith to the deepest spiritual apprehensions of the Chinese religious tradition. The veneration of Confucius, the great Chinese religious and philosophical leader, and the religious honors paid to ancestors were to be seen not as elements of so-called paganism to be rejected out of hand but as rituals of Chinese society that could be adapted to Christian purposes. Although Ricci’s apostolic labors won him many converts in China, they also aroused the suspicion of many in the West that the distinctiveness of Christianity was being compromised. The suspicion did not assert itself officially until long after Ricci’s death, but, when it did, the outcome was a condemnation of the so-called Chinese rites by Pope Clement XI in 1704 and 1715 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742. Ancestor veneration and Confucian devotion were said to be inseparable elements of traditional Chinese religion and hence incompatible with Christian worship and doctrine.\n\nSuppression of the Jesuits\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nAmong the repercussions of the controversy over Chinese rites was an intensification of the resentment directed against the Jesuits. Their preeminent position among the religious orders and their championship of the pope exposed them to hostility, and by the middle of the 18th century a variety of adversaries, both lay and clerical, were seeking to destroy the order. The opposition can be traced to several reasons, primarily to the anticlerical and antipapal spirit of the times. Hostility to the Jesuits was further inspired by their defense of the Indigenous populations in some parts of the Americas—notably the Guaraní in Paraguay and the Indigenous converts in the missions of the Amazon River basin in Brazil—against abuses committed by Spanish and Portuguese colonizers. Moreover, the sheer strength of the order was regarded as an impediment to the establishment of absolute monarchist rule.\n\nThe Portuguese crown expelled the Jesuits in 1759, France made them illegal in 1764, and Spain and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies took other repressive action in 1767. Opponents of the Society of Jesus achieved their greatest success when they took their case to Rome. Although Pope Clement XIII refused to act against the Jesuits, his successor, Pope Clement XIV, issued a brief abolishing the order in 1773. The society’s corporate existence was maintained in Russia, where political circumstances—notably the opposition of Catherine II the Great—prevented the canonical execution of the suppression. The demand that the Jesuits take up their former work became so insistent that in 1814 Pope Pius VII reestablished the society. Meanwhile, however, the suppression of the Jesuits had done serious damage to the missions and the educational program of the church at a time when both enterprises were under great pressure. These devastating effects included the closure of many Jesuit schools, hospitals, and missions around the world and the confiscation or wholesale destruction of Jesuit apostolic works and texts.\n\nPedro Arrupe, liberation theology, and Pope Francis\n\nAfter the society was restored, the Jesuits grew to be the largest male religious order. Work in education on all levels continued to involve more Jesuits than any other activity, while the number of Jesuits working in the mission fields, especially in Asia and Africa, exceeded that of any other religious order. They were involved in a broad and complex list of activities, including the field of communications, social work, ecumenism, human rights, and politics. In 1968 the Jesuit superior general, Pedro Arrupe, refocused the order with “a preferential option for the poor,” and the Jesuit ranks experienced a rise in the popularity of liberation theology, which holds that ministry should include involvement in the political struggle of the poor. This ideology influenced a number of Jesuit leaders in Latin America in the late 20th century, some of whom were met with violence and death because of their activism. It also brought the order into conflict with Pope John Paul II, who sought to curb the movement by appointing conservative prelates in Latin America. In 2013 Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina became Pope Francis, the first Jesuit to be elected pope.\n\nColonial slavery and the Jesuits\n\nThroughout Europeans’ colonization of the Americas, the Jesuits exhibited a mixed record on slavery. Although some Jesuits served as protectors and advocates of Indigenous populations during the colonial era, particularly against their enslavement, the order was among the largest enslavers in places such as the French island of Martinique in the Caribbean, French Guiana in South America, and colonial Maryland and Louisiana in the United States. Jesuit missions contributed to the spread of deadly European diseases among Indigenous populations and relied on the labor of enslaved Indigenous and African people. Many Jesuit missions, churches, and schools also benefited from the sale of enslaved Africans and African Americans; the profits from such trafficking were used to support or expand the order’s institutions. By the mid-18th century and the beginning of the suppression, the Jesuits’ holdings included more than 20,000 enslaved people throughout the Americas.\n\nIn the United States the order used and trafficked enslaved people until the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865. The earliest known Jesuit community to use forced labor in what became the United States was a mission founded by French Jesuits in 1703 along the Kaskaskia River in Illinois. The Kaskaskia Jesuits used enslaved Native Americans and Africans to work their plantation and were the largest enslavers in Illinois until the order’s suppression by the French.\n\nIn Maryland, where the Jesuits first arrived in 1634, the order received extensive land tracts that were initially worked by indentured labor. By the beginning of the 18th century that labor force had been replaced by enslaved people, specifically Africans and African Americans. Some members of this enslaved population worked in various roles at Georgetown College (now Georgetown University), which the Jesuits founded in 1789 and was the first Roman Catholic college in the United States. By 1838 the Maryland Jesuits had fallen into deep debt, partly because of unprofitable plantations; in order to keep the college afloat, on June 19 Jesuit provincial superior Thomas Mulledy signed a bill of sale of 272 enslaved people to Jesse Batey and Henry Johnson, both of whom owned sugar plantations in Louisiana. A large number of the people listed on the bill of sale were then trafficked to Louisiana. The 272 individuals included children less than a year old. Even after the sale, the college and the Maryland Jesuits continued to use enslaved labor, essentially until slavery was abolished.\n\nThe 1838 sale and the fate of the “GU272” (as those who were trafficked came to be known through an activist campaign on social media) came to public attention in 2016 after a series of articles about the sale were published in The New York Times. In 2017 the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States issued a public apology to the descendants of the GU272. The order also established the Slavery, History, Memory, and Reconciliation Project in partnership with Saint Louis University, another Jesuit institution that relied on enslaved laborers. The project works with descendants of enslaved people and with historians and genealogists to address the legacy of Jesuit slaveholding. In 2023 the Jesuits pledged a donation of $17 million in the form of financial reparations and plantation land to the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, which supports descendants of the GU272, while Georgetown University pledged a $10 million donation.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
