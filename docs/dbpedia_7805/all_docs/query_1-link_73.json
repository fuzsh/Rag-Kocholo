Edit16 20779; 34341.\n\n7 1/6 x 5 1/8 in.\n\nFrom the Collection of Professor Roberto Severino, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Constitutions of the Society of Jesus, one of the fundamental Jesuit texts consisting of guidelines for them to follow, were written by the founder of the order, St. Ignatius of Loyola with the help of Juan de Polanco. Written originally in Spanish and first published as a manuscript in 1553, it was later translated into an official Latin version that was published in 1559. This edition of the Constitutions includes the \"Declarations\" as commentary alongside the text in the \"Exam\" and \"Constitutions.\"\n\nExpected wear to vellum with age cracking and minor wormholes, some staining and losses, manuscript on front cover, spine with small tears, cracks, and loss at tail, lacking ties; interior lightly toned (one gathering with heavier toning), with foxing, one page with minor marginalia, and small occasional stains including damp staining at first two gatherings."
