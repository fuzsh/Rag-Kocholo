        "text": "Home\n\nWho We Are\n\nOur Catholic & Jesuit Heritage\n\nOur Catholic & Jesuit Heritage\n\nShaped by centuries of Jesuit education around the globe, our culture embraces the changing times while staying true to core values – engaging your intellect, helping you grow ethically and spiritually, exchanging ideas freely and building a more just world.\n\n1 of 1\n\nA Place for All Faiths\n\nOne of the ways that we embody our Jesuit heritage is by making a home for all faith traditions. Whether you’re religious, nonreligious or searching for a spiritual home, we accompany you on your journey and help you lead a life of deeper meaning, belonging and purpose.\n\n1 of 1\n\nThe Jesuit Experience\n\nStudents often ask about the theology component at Georgetown and what it means to attend a Jesuit university. Renato (SFS’24) reflects on his experience at Georgetown and how he lives out the university’s Catholic, Jesuit values every day.\n\n1 of 1\n\nLife-Changing Service\n\nService and community engagement are a way of life here. Choose among the more than 100 university-sponsored service programs and opportunities and help address some of the most pressing issues facing local, national and international communities. From alternative break programs to a class that works to exonerate the wrongfully accused, you’ll join a united community of people for others.\n\nA Testimonial\n\n“We talk about wanting students to be lifelong learners. I want students to be lifelong reflectors, meaning I want them to cultivate the habit of reflecting on things. I think this is distinctly important for a Jesuit and Catholic education, and I think The Problem of God is one course that encourages students to do that.”\n\nBuilding a More Just World\n\nGeorgetown supports new regulation issued by the Department of Homeland Security that strengthens the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected more than 800,000 young adults from deportation.\n\nIn celebration of Earth Month, learn how Earth Commons Director Peter P. Marra and Anna Giaquinto (B’21) are developing scalable solutions to address urgent challenges on our planet.\n\nThe Spirit of Georgetown\n\n1 of 9\n\n1 of 9\n\nThe Spirit of Georgetown\n\nCura Personalis\n\nCura personalis encourages care and individualized attention to the needs of each person, distinct respect for his or her circumstances and concerns and an appropriate appreciation for his or her particular gifts and insights.\n\nPeople for Others\n\nCoined by Rev. Pedro Arrupe, S.J., “people for others” challenges the alumni of Jesuit schools and universities to be engaged in the struggle for justice to protect the needs of the most vulnerable.\n\nCommunity in Diversity\n\nAs a Catholic and Jesuit university, we welcome and sustain rich diversity among our students, faculty and staff.\n\nContemplation in Action\n\nContemplation is a critical dimension of the spiritual life, and it is reflected in Georgetown’s commitment to prayer, worship and retreats.\n\nEducating the Whole Person\n\nSt. Ignatius believed that God could be discovered in every human endeavor, in every facet of learning and experience and in every field of study.\n\nFaith and Justice\n\nThe Jesuits made a significant institutional commitment to “the service of faith and the promotion of justice,” an obligation to address the social realities of poverty, oppression and injustice.\n\nInterreligious Understanding\n\nReflecting themes from the Second Vatican Council, the 34th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus made a significant commitment to ecumenical and interreligious engagement and understanding.\n\nAcademic Excellence\n\nAcademic excellence describes the great importance that Jesuits have placed on the life of the mind as a means for uncovering truth and discovering meaning.\n\nAd Majorem Dei Gloriam\n\nThis motto identifies the religious purpose of all Jesuit endeavors. It is not simply doing good that Jesuits propose, but rather doing what will better or more effectively reveal God’s active presence in our work and in our world.\n\n1 of 1\n\nJesuit History\n\nWith over 16,000 Jesuits around the world, 28 colleges and universities in the United States and dozens of high schools and primary schools around the country, the Society of Jesus has left a significant imprint on American education and Catholicism. But how did they get there?\n\nMeet the Jesuits\n\nFrom the beginnings of the Society of Jesus – education, ministry and outreach to marginalized people have been at the core of the Jesuit mission. But who exactly are the Jesuits? How do they fit into the Catholic Church? How does their tradition continue on campus today? Find answers to these questions and more."
