        "text": "Why are the Jesuits also called âThe Society of Jesusâ?\n\nSt Ignatius, one of the founders of the Jesuits, built his Spiritual Exercises on the life and example of Jesus. He believed that the more we came to know Jesus, the more we would grow to love Him â a love that would then draw us into deeper service of God and the world.\n\nIndeed, so central was Jesus to St Ignatius, that he prayed to be given the honour of serving Him. He wished that he and his own companions, the first Jesuits, could also be companions of Jesus â being close to Jesus so they could become more like Him in all they did, but also so that they could help others to see something of Jesus in and through their actions.\n\nThe prayer of St Ignatius was answered in one of his most important visions, at La Storta on the way to Rome. He saw Christ carrying his cross and heard God the Father say to Jesus, âI wish you to take this man [Ignatius] for your servantâ and Jesus, in turn, spoke to Ignatius, confirming that âMy will is that you should serve usâ. Â\n\nThe name Ignatius and his first companions chose for their new group emerged also from this vision. It was clear to them that they had to take the name the âCompany of Jesusâ because Jesus alone was their head. It was Jesus who had taken them all into His company, and that made them companions of Him, as Ignatius had so fervently wished; but they were also companions of each other, friends in the Lord, alongside Jesus, carrying His cross.\n\nWe want to introduce you to Jesus as we have come to know Him â as the person who has transformed our lives. So, who was Jesus of Nazareth? Why does He continue to bring new life and hope to people all around the world? What is so life-changing about His teaching and what can happen if you let Him enter more and more into your life?\n\nJesus, Son of God\n\nThrough Jesus, humanity came to a fuller understanding of God. Why would God choose to become part of His own creation? The short answer is that it was the culmination of Godâs self-introduction to humanity.\n\nâLong ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son.â Â Hebrews 1:1-2\n\nMore than this, it was Godâs way of bringing us closer to Him. This was Jesusâ mission and the goal of His life, to bring us back to full unity with God the Father, by showing us the depth of Godâs love.\n\nGod entered the human experience to break the power of sin and death in the world and, through the example of the Son, to model for us a new way of living. As Pope Benedict has taught:\n\nâIn Jesus of Nazareth we encounter the face of God, who came down from his heaven to immerse himself in the human world, in our world, and to teach âthe art of livingâ, the road to happiness; to set us free from sin and make us children of God.â Pope Benedict XVI\n\nWhat did Jesus teach?\n\nAt the heart of Jesusâ teaching are some very simple lessons. The first is that God is love and that God loves each of us in the same way. No matter who we are or what we have done, God does not stop loving us.\n\nJesus repeatedly taught that God invites all of us to share in the promise of new life. There is no âin-groupâ or excluded, no advantage for the rich or powerful. The ways of the world are turned on their head. All are welcome, equally, because Godâs love and mercy are all-embracing.\n\nThe image Jesus offers is of a royal banquet with the Father as a generous host who tells his servants to âgo into the main streets, and invite everyone to the wedding banquetâ, with a welcome extended to âboth good and badâ so that the wedding hall is âfilled with guestsâ (Matt. 22: 9-10). None of us âearnsâ the invitation, but we all receive one. It is Godâs love that gets us there. Our task is to put our best foot forward, accept the invitation, and just as Jesus did to His Father, and as much as we can, say âYesâ to God every day.\n\nJesus came to bring us into a new relationship with God and with each other.\n\nLove your neighbour\n\nAs Jesus showed us, the Christian life at its best is about self-giving. He lived not for Himself, but for the glory of God and in service of others, and He asks us to do the same. As He taught\n\nâ ... you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strengthâ . . . Â [and] âYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.â There is no other commandment greater than these.â Mark 12:30-31\n\nOf course, Jesus did not just teach others to love their neighbour, He also lived out this teaching in radical ways. The New Testament is filled with stories of Jesus ministering to, and reaching out to those on the margins, to the outcasts of his society. And He calls on each of us to do the same:\n\nâThe king will say to those at his right hand, âCome, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you visited me.â Then the righteous will answer him, âLord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?â And the king will answer them, âTruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to meâ.â Matthew 40:34-40\n\nJesus prays from the heart\n\nHe asks us to speak simply and from the heart.\n\nJesus is also clear about using normal language when we pray to God. God the Father knows us intimately and this means we can be totally honest, totally ourselves:\n\nâAnd in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.â Matthew 6:7-8\n\nOften this simplicity can be found in the traditional prayers of the Church. One that was important to Saint Ignatius, is the great prayer to Jesus, the Anima Christi:\n\nSoul of Christ, sanctify me.\n\nBody of Christ, save me.\n\nBlood of Christ, inebriate me.\n\nWater from the side of Christ, wash me.\n\nPassion of Christ, strengthen me.\n\nO Good Jesus, hear me.\n\nWithin your wounds hide me.\n\nPermit me not to be separated from you.\n\nFrom the wicked foe, defend me.\n\nAt the hour of my death, call me\n\nand bid me come to you\n\nThat with your saints I may praise you\n\nForever and ever. Amen.\n\nAnd he knows that prayer can and does change us, and the world.\n\nJesus says that if we pray about the most important things in our lives, God will hear us and answer us. If we are troubled or have a big decision to make, God will shine a light and show us the way ahead:\n\nâAsk, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door will be opened.â Matthew 7: 7-8\n\nDid Jesus rise from the dead?\n\nChristianity has always taught that Jesus rose from the dead based on the personal accounts of those for whom it was a transformational experience. Simply put, without the Resurrection, Christianity would not exist. The very essence of the first Christian proclamation was Jesusâ resurrection. The disciples could not be silenced because their encounters with the risen Jesus had changed them to their very core. They turned from cowering in fear or fleeing, to boldly proclaiming an event that was âa scandal for the Jews, and foolishness for the gentilesâ (1 Corinthians 1:23).\n\nSt. Paul spoke about some of these direct encounters with the risen Jesus when he wrote to one of the earliest Christian communities:\n\nâFor I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still aliveâ. 1 Corinthians 15:3-6\n\nBelief in the resurrection is an act of faith, but we can find evidence of its power in our own lives and in the world around us. In nature, the rhythm of life does mean new shoots emerging every year â death is overcome time and again; life can reach into the most difficult or seemingly inhospitable of places. And that is because life is a stronger force.\n\nEven in the darkest and most difficult experiences of our lives, we know that new life can and does also emerge. As Pope Francis reminds us:\n\nâChristâs resurrection is not an event of the past; it contains a vital power which has permeated this world. Where all seems to be dead, signs of the resurrection suddenly spring up. It is an irresistible force.â Pope Francis, The Joy of the Gospel\n\nHow can we know Jesus today?\n\nSpending time with Him in prayer\n\nThe easiest way for you to connect with Jesus today is to pray to Him. In the last words that Jesus speaks in Matthewâs gospel, He promises, âI am with you always, to the close of the age.â Matthew 28:20\n\nKnowing this, you can be bold in praying to Jesus, knowing that He cares about the details of your life. Pope Francis advises being completely honest when praying to Jesus. âJesus likes to see the truth of our heart. Don't pretend in front of Jesus. With Jesus, always say what you are feeling.â\n\nReflecting on what He said\n\nThe majority of what is known about Jesusâ life comes from the Bible, specifically the Gospels. Here, you can find detailed accounts of what Jesus was like, how He spent His time on Earth, the stories He told and the things He cared about.\n\nSt Ignatius invites us to spend time getting to know Jesus through the stories of His life. One powerful way of connecting to Jesus through Scripture is by imaginative prayer.\n\nOpening ourselves to the presence of the Holy Spirit\n\nThrough the Holy Spirit, God is active and present in the world today. Jesus spoke of the important role of the Spirit:\n\nâBut the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.â John 14:26-27\n\nIgnatian Spirituality can help us grow in awareness of the workings of the Spirit in our lives and in the world around us.\n\nDiscovering Jesus in His Church\n\nChristianity teaches that Jesus established a Church on Earth. One of the most powerful images of the Church is as the âmystical body of Christâ. It represents difference but also unity; each part of the body has its distinctive shape and function, but we all need each other, we work best together. This idea of communion is another powerful image for the Church â we are a community, something that is increasingly precious in this current age.\n\nWe invite you to join or deepen your involvement, in the community of the Church, perhaps through one of our Jesuit parishes.\n\nMeeting Jesus in the service of others\n\nDuring his life on Earth, Jesus spent his time with those on the margins, with the poorest, the outcasts, those suffering illness or rejection. There can be no clearer sign that this is also where we will encounter Jesus in the world today.\n\nIn the Beatitudes, Jesus shows his love and concern for those who are suffering and oppressed. They offer a model for how we can serve the world today.\n\nIf you are interested in helping with the work we do among refugees, the homeless, and internationally, you can find out more below."
