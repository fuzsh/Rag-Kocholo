        "text": "The Catholic missionaries in our reading by Rhonda were French. The French involvement in America had started with shipping and trade journeys to Canada in the 1500s. During the 1600s, the French set up more elaborate trading posts and, like the English, made plans to colonize the areas around the Great Lakes and what is now New England. The French government decided that Catholic missionaries should accompany the businessmen and convert the Indians. Most of these missionaries were from an order of Catholics known as the Jesuits.\n\nThe official name of the Jesuit order, founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, was the Society of Jesus. Because Ignatius had been a soldier before he dedicated his life to the Church as a monk and priest, Jesuits have been called “foot soldiers of the Pope.” The order began in Paris, when Ignatius and six friends took mutual oaths of poverty and chastity, and vowed to dedicate themselves to hospital and missionary work, or whatever work the Pope deemed necessary. In 1540, they traveled to Italy to obtain the Pope’s approval for their new order. In the years to come, the order grew rapidly, quickly becoming one of the strongest and largest Catholic orders of men. They became one of many other, similar, orders such as the Franciscans and Benedictines.\n\nThese orders were composed of groups of men who set themselves apart from the rest of society and devoted their lives to their religion. Some were ordained priests, but not all. They generally referred to themselves as monks or friars—men dedicated to their Church, but not authorized to lead Masses or administer sacraments (more on these Catholic rituals later) Religious orders for women—the Carmelites, for example—and for both genders, have also been established. The Jesuits were exceptionally enthusiastic and vigorous in their missionary efforts and traveled extensively to seek converts. These French Catholics were the primary missionary group in North America.\n\n�2006 The Pennsylvania State University"
