        "text": "By of the\n\nWalk along the campus of Marquette University and you will see, etched into the cornerstones of its buildings, the letters A.M.D.G.\n\nIt is shorthand for the Latin phrase ad majorem Dei gloriam - \"For the greater glory of God.\"\n\nThat is the motto of the Society of Jesus - the Jesuits - a worldwide religious order that has produced the Catholic Church's newest pontiff, Pope Francis, who will be installed at the Vatican on Tuesday.\n\nThe church's largest religious order, with about 18,000 priests and brothers worldwide, the Jesuits are known today primarily as educators and advocates for service and social justice who espouse a distinct spirituality.\n\nThe election of the first Jesuit as pope - at a time of unrest within the church, as in society - seems to some particularly appropriate in the context of founder Ignatius of Loyola's original vision for the order five centuries ago.\n\n\"Ignatius wanted us to be an army of missionaries ready at a moment's notice to go anywhere the pope wanted us to go,\" said Father Tom Lawler, who heads the society's Wisconsin province. \"That's what it means to be a Jesuit - to serve wherever there is a need.\"\n\nJoining the order involves a rigorous discerning of God's will for one's life, following the writings of Ignatius as a guide - a discernment that becomes part of their daily lives.\n\nWhen they profess their vows, Jesuits undergo an intensely focused 30-day silent retreat in search of that knowledge. Fellow Jesuits, even those who never heard of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio before his elevation to pope, place great significance on the fact that he has made the \"spiritual exercises.\"\n\n\"It says, as a fully formed Jesuit, that we share the same fundamental view of the world and what our role in the world should be,\" Marquette University President Father Scott Pilarz said.\n\nJesuits have historically served as evangelists, missionaries and influential advisers to popes and kings, eventually developing reputations as scholars and educators.\n\nTradition of education\n\nTheir most prominent role today is operating more than 160 Jesuit educational institutions worldwide - primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, seminaries and theological centers. The Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome was the first university founded by the Jesuits, and fully one-third of the current College of Cardinals who elected Francis last week has studied there at one time or another.\n\nIn the United States, the order runs 28 colleges and universities - Marquette, Georgetown, St. Louis, Boston College, Xavier, Creighton, Gonzaga and others - making it the nation's largest network of Catholic institutions of higher learning.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the Jesuits' footprint extends to Marquette University High School, Nativity Middle School, and the combined south side parishes of Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Patrick, along with Gesu Parish at the university. It also runs a spiritual retreat center near Oshkosh on Lake Winnebago.\n\nAs members of a religious order, separate from local dioceses, Jesuits generally live as a community. In Milwaukee, for example, about 50 Jesuits live in a residence on the Marquette campus, where they often pray and take their meals together.\n\nIn addition to their vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, most Jesuits take two others in keeping with their original \"charism,\" or ethos, of service. Most promise not to aspire to positions of authority - Ignatius disdained the ambition of the climbing bishops of his day - and they vow obedience to the pope.\n\nThat Bergoglio ascended to cardinal and now the papacy suggests that he was explicitly asked to take on those roles, Lawler said.\n\n\"That's what he is showing us by his example,\" Lawler said, \"that he is serving where there is the greatest need.\"\n\nThe order's formation\n\nThe Jesuits trace their history to Ignatius of Loyola, a 16th-century Basque knight wounded in battle who founded the order in France after a religious conversion during his convalescence.\n\nBergoglio's choice of a papal name honoring St. Francis of Assisi initially baffled some who saw it as more Franciscan than Jesuit. But Ignatius looked to the ascetic Francis as model of simple living as he rejected the worldly ways of the Spanish court, according to scholars.\n\nThe original Jesuits, formed in the midst of the Protestant Reformation, were a small brotherhood - a society of companions of Jesus - who preached the faith. And their straightforward sometimes theatrical style was successful in attracting many who'd strayed.\n\nUntethered to the strict prayer schedule of monastic life, they were free to move about. And in time, they would make significant inroads into the far reaches of the world - the Americas, China, Japan and elsewhere.\n\nJesuits became adept at a kind of cultural sensitivity that allowed them to frame Christianity in ways that were attractive and accessible to native peoples - though that was a source of criticism by some who saw them as watering down the faith.\n\nThey gained prominence in the 18th century, developing reputations as intellectuals and advisers to noblemen and kings. They began building schools at the behest of civic leaders who sought them out to educate their children.\n\nFrench Jesuits, including PÃ¨re Jacques Marquette, were among the first Catholic priests in North America, where they would build on that education mission, often adapting it to the needs of the new world.\n\n\"The emphasis on local adaptation is very important,\" Marquette's Pilarz said, noting that the inclusion of such subjects as law, business and engineering was a uniquely American approach encouraged by immigrants seeking a more practical experience.\n\nOne Milwaukee adaptation - opening Marquette's doors to women 100 years ago - cost its president at the time his job, Pilarz said.\n\nCentral to the Jesuit education are intellectual discernment in the Ignatian tradition and service.\n\n\"One of the mottos of the (late Jesuit Father General) Pedro Arrupe was that a Jesuit institution should teach students to be men and women for others,\" said Father Doug Leonhardt, Marquette University's associate vice president of mission and ministry.\n\nLike most religious orders, as well as diocesan priests, Jesuit numbers are in decline, though not everywhere in the world.\n\n\"When I was a young man, the country with the most Jesuits was the United States, but today it's India,\" said Marquette professor emeritus Patrick Donnelly, who has written three early histories of the order. \"In India, we're growing,\" he said.\n\nConflicts with Vatican\n\nThe Jesuits have had strained relationships with the Vatican and their local dioceses over the years.\n\nThe order was decommissioned by the Vatican for 40 years beginning in the 18th century under pressure by European governments, which saw them as too lax and their defense of indigenous peoples in the Americas as meddling in their colonial interests.\n\nPope John Paul II briefly took control of the order beginning in 1981 over its activities in Latin America, where Jesuits often sided with peasants and rebels in their fights against totalitarian regimes. Six Jesuit priests and their housekeeper were assassinated by U.S.-trained Salvadoran troops in 1989. Jesuits continue to protest U.S. involvement in Latin America, most notably in annual demonstrations at Fort Benning in Georgia.\n\nA 92-year-old Milwaukee Jesuit, Father Bill Brennan, was sanctioned jointly by the archdiocese and his order last year for saying Mass with a female priest during the 2012 protest.\n\nThe Vatican has muzzled Jesuit theologians over the years - American Jesuit John Courtney Murray, whose views on the separation of church and state are now widely accepted; and the German Karl Rahner, who would go on to play an important role at the Second Vatican Council.\n\nThe Jesuits' often progressive ideas and emphasis on scholarly inquiry have fed criticisms of the order over the years as elitist and not really Catholic - or not Catholic enough.\n\n\"Occasionally, there can be some tension around the way a particular Jesuit might address a problem, what kind of analysis he might apply,\" Pilarz said.\n\n\"But we are now in a period of good relations - if not, we would not have a Jesuit elected pope.\"\n\nSex abuse scandal\n\nLike the broader church, the Jesuits have struggled to come to terms with their role in the sexual abuse scandal. In 2011, the order's northwest province agreed to pay $166 million to 500 victims, many of whom were abused as children on reservations and in remote Alaskan villages where the order sent problem priests.\n\nSimilar lawsuits were filed against the Wisconsin province for alleged abuses at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, but they were dismissed as beyond the statute of limitations.\n\nAnd in 2011, victims sought an apology from then Marquette President Robert Wild for leaving serial pedophile Donald McGuire - now defrocked and in prison - in ministry when Wild headed the Jesuits' Chicago province years earlier.\n\nAlready victims' advocates are calling on Pope Francis to address the sex abuse issue globally.\n\nThat is just one of the daunting issues that will confront Pope Francis, whose church faces many challenges: declining membership and vocations in a large part of the world; a faithful divided over theology and ideology; and a dysfunctional bureaucracy; religious persecution; and poverty.\n\nThe new pope already has set something of a tone for his papacy - asking the faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square to pray for him before he blessed them, shunning some of the trappings associated with the papacy. He is, by all accounts, a modest, simple man who lives humbly.\n\nHe is likely to approach the issues of the church, Jesuits say, through the prism of his Ignatian spirituality and world view, with a singular focus: \"For the greater glory of God.\""
