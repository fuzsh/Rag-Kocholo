        "text": "25.04.24\n\nEditorial Note\n\nThe ongoing war in Gaza has impacted the campuses, especially the United States, where pro-Palestinian protesters have been occupying buildings and setting up tent encampments. A less noticeable but deeply troubling development pertains to the unofficial boycott of Israeli scholars.\n\nIn January, the Israel Young Academy, founded by the Israel Academy of Science and Humanities, surveyed 1,000 senior faculty members at all Israeli institutions. Accordingly, one-third of the scholars reported a significant slump in ties with counterparts abroad. Similarly, Or Kashti reported on the same topic in a Haaretz article titled “‘I Won’t Work With You. You’re Committing Genocide’: Israeli Academia Faces an Unprecedented Boycott.” Kashti talked to some 60 Israeli scholars who painted a painful picture of the boycott they have experienced since the Gaza war broke out. Detailing many cases of canceled invitations to academic conferences, a freeze on hiring Israeli academics at overseas universities, rejection of scientific articles, and disruption of lectures abroad.\n\nAs Kashti reports, the academics spoke about their “experiences with colleagues abroad since October 7. They recounted dozens of incidents: cancellation of invitations to conferences, a freeze on their appointments in foreign institutions, rejection of scientific articles on political grounds, disruption of lectures abroad, cessation of collaborative efforts with colleagues abroad, refusal by such colleagues to take part in the promotion process their Israeli counterparts must undergo at local institutions, and even a sweeping boycott of local colleges and universities. The following examples, all from recent months and backed up by documents and emails, are being made public here for the first time. The plethora of events leaves no room for doubt: Israel is feeling the brunt of an unprecedented academic boycott, which is only gathering momentum.”\n\nHaaretz provided many more examples, but IAM includes only the following.\n\nIn February, Gilad Hirschberger, a social psychologist at Reichman University, was invited to be the keynote speaker at a conference by a Norwegian organization that deals with collective trauma. Hirschberger intended to present “the effects of collective trauma in our region on both Israelis and Palestinians.” However, the next day, he received a message, “I regret to inform you that we have to withdraw our invitation. This decision has been taken by the organizing committee for the conference. The argument is to avoid collaboration with representatives of countries involved in ongoing warfare,” the Norwegian wrote. Hirschberger knew, “I was rejected because I am an Israeli.”\n\nNir Davidson, a Weizmann Institute of Science physics professor, suggested to an Italian colleague that they try to request a grant together from a competitive research foundation. The Italian colleague responded, “Because of the atrocities your country is perpetrating against innocent civilians, thousands of professors and researchers have signed a petition calling for all research collaboration to be blocked… I’m afraid that what your country has done and is continuing to do will never be forgotten or forgiven.”\n\nDr. Ravit Alfandari, from the University of Haifa’s School of Social Work, worked with a researcher from Northern Ireland for over a year on a study about domestic violence, which continued after the war in Gaza broke out. The Irish colleague wrote, “I understand you… I too know what it’s like to live under a threat.” But then he informed her that he had signed a petition calling for an academic boycott of Israel. “He said, ‘I hold you in great esteem, but I don’t intend to work with you ever again. It’s not a temporary thing. You are committing genocide in Gaza.”\n\nProf. Einat Metzl, head of the arts therapy program at Bar-Ilan University, was slated to visit a university in Los Angeles to lead a joint training program in her field. Her visit was canceled when three students objected to inviting a lecturer from Israel.\n\nDr. Dan Mamlok, from the School of Education at Tel Aviv University, arrived in Montreal in March to deliver a lecture at a research center. He was confronted by dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators who blocked the entry of the attendees. “It was surprising and ironic to discover demonstrators against a lecture that dealt with education for tolerance in a polarized society… I came as a researcher of education – not as a representative of the Israeli government.” Mamlok managed to get into the building and deliver the talk before a small audience.\n\nProf. Netta Barak-Koren, from Hebrew University’s law school, currently on a sabbatical in the United States who a few weeks ago organized a conference at a leading U.S. university. She said, “Suddenly universities are discussing the possibility of holding a conference in less prominent venues, or even after the end of the academic year, in order to avoid demonstrations.”\n\nProf. Yuval Feldman from Bar-Ilan tweeted on X, on March 25, “The process of a quite prestigious appointment abroad for myself was suspended this week because ‘this is not the most appropriate time.'” Feldman wrote, “I wonder whether we are encountering a new reality abroad that will not end even if the situation in Israel improves – a kind of genie that we won’t be able to put back into the bottle.”\n\nDr. Liat Ayalon, from Bar-Ilan’s School of Social Work, submitted in November a short article to an academic journal. The article dealt with the war’s impact on the situation of Israel’s elderly community. Shortly afterward, the editor called and asked her to withdraw the article. “He said that he could not send it out for peer review,” Prof. Ayalon relates. “He explained that the feelings in the United States against Israel were so strong that he was afraid that publishing the article would be detrimental to the journal.” The editor eventually backed down but Ayalon had already submitted the article elsewhere.\n\nPhilip Cohen, a professor of sociology and demography at the University of Maryland, explained in his blog why he had refused a request from the Israel Science Foundation to review a research proposal. “I believe the international community cannot permit the normalization of relations with the State of Israel in light of its actions in Gaza and the West Bank since October 7… In the absence of responsible state action by your government (or ours), I must instead do what I can to contribute to the diplomatic, political, and even scientific isolation of the state… I don’t know if my peers in Israel understand the extent of their global isolation.”\n\nHaaretz noted that “A number of universities and academic organizations in Belgium, Spain, Italy and Norway recently announced full boycotts or a suspension of ties with Israeli institutions until they receive clarifications with regard to topics ranging from the state of academic freedom on their campuses, to their moral, financial and material support for Israel’s defense forces.” For one, Ghent University recently requested such information from its counterpart in Haifa.\n\nAmerican studies Professor Milette Shamir, the vice president of Tel Aviv University, was in Australia recently to attend an academic fair at the University of Sydney. When she arrived, pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted that Tel Aviv University shares in crimes against the Palestinians and that all collaborations with Israel should end. She told Haaretz that boycotts “keep mounting to the point of paralyzing the system. The result will be a mortal blow to Israeli academia. It will take on a provincial character and we will not be able to integrate into the forefront of the world’s research.”\n\nDr. Moran Benhar of the Technion’s Faculty of Medicine was scheduled to participate in a scientific conference of the Society for Free Radical Research International in Istanbul in June. In February, she was notified that due to the war in Gaza, the government of Turkey had decided to bar Israeli scientists from taking part in the event. Benhar contacted a leading Jewish scientist at Harvard, who was due to receive a research prize at the Istanbul event. Within a short time, the scientist informed the organizers that he would not attend a conference that boycotted Israeli researchers. A few days later, the society’s directors announced that all restrictions had been lifted.\n\nThe rejection and isolation of Israeli scholars is highly alarming, not to mention bitterly ironic. When the BDS movement initiated calls to boycott Israeli academic institutions and various associations adopted this call, they were careful to emphasize that individual scholars, as opposed to institutions, were not targeted. In reality, as noted, individual academics are being boycotted because they are Israelis and “engage in genocide,” no matter if they support peace. To the historians of antisemitism, this equation sounds familiar. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they dropped all distinction between the individual and the group, blaming all Jews for whatever “sins” the Jewish collective was accused of.\n\nSecond, this classic antisemitic equivalence should be especially irritating to the radical Israeli scholars often profiled by IAM. By joining the various BDS initiatives and trashing Israel in whatever way they could, they hoped to pass as the “good Israelis,” not to be confused with their bad compatriots who “support genocide” in Gaza. But, as noted, the rejections do not distinguish between the “good academics” and the “bad academics.” Studying the history of antisemitism would have told them so.\n\nAcademic institutions should implement the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism to fight BDS.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/he-il/news/other/i-won-t-work-with-you-you-re-committing-genocide-israeli-academia-faces-an-unprecedented-boycott/ar-BB1ltF3S\n\nHaaretz.com\n\n‘I Won’t Work With You. You’re Committing Genocide’: Israeli Academia Faces an Unprecedented Boycott\n\nBy Or Kashti\n\nCanceled invitations to conferences, a freeze on hiring Israelis at overseas institutions, rejection of scientific articles on political grounds, disruption of lectures abroad – Israeli scholars from various disciplines paint a painful picture of the foreign boycott that has afflicted them since the war broke out in Gaza\n\nApril 12th, 01AM April 12th, 02AM\n\nIn February, Gilad Hirschberger received an invitation to be the keynote speaker at a conference to be held this October by a Norwegian organization that deals with collective trauma. The invitation, from an Oslo-based research center, came in the wake of studies conducted by Prof. Hirschberger – a social psychologist at Reichman University, in Herzliya – including one on the long-term effects of the Holocaust.\n\n“Victim and perpetrator perspectives on a group level seem very relevant to our work,” one of the organizers wrote. “We are of course aware of the tragedies and the ongoing conflict in your part of the world, which also has global impact. We would of course be interested to hear your thoughts on how this might influence your views on collective trauma today.”\n\nIn the days that followed, a series of messages was exchanged between the Norwegian psychologist and Hirschberger, who also serves as vice dean of Reichman’s Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, about his lecture. “Polarization between extremes is among the consequences of terror and war,” wrote his Norwegian contact person. “We would be grateful if you would be willing to discuss shortly this aspect of our conference.” Hirschberger replied that he intended to present “the effects of collective trauma in our region on both Israelis and Palestinians.”\n\nHowever, the next day a very different message arrived. “I regret to inform you that we have to withdraw our invitation. This decision has been taken by the organizing committee for the conference. The argument is to avoid collaboration with representatives of countries involved in ongoing warfare,” the Norwegian wrote, not concealing his own criticism of the decision.\n\nHirschberger was taken aback. “I have been active in the contentious field of political psychology for many years, but never have I encountered such a direct, blunt response,” he says. “I was rejected because I am an Israeli.” His response: “To treat an individual negatively because of their group membership is the essence of prejudice. If psychologists can’t contain their prejudice, and if even clinical psychologists express such intolerance, what hope does the rest of the world have?”\n\nEven ignoring, for a moment, the response of his Norwegian counterparts, it’s clear to him who is going to pay the price. “Israeli academia is liable to find itself in a new situation regarding participation in conferences, fundraising for research or publication of articles,” he says. “We are totally dependent on international connections. Collaboration with us will become increasingly difficult, it will be considered something beyond the pale.”\n\nIs Israeli academia about to enter a whole new phase? All signs are that it already has. In the past few weeks, Haaretz spoke with more than 60 Israeli scholars – from a wide range of disciplines and academic institutions, including both young scientists and university presidents – about their experiences with colleagues abroad since the war broke out in the Gaza Strip after Hamas’ massacre on October 7. They recounted dozens of incidents: cancellation of invitations to conferences, a freeze on their appointments in foreign institutions, rejection of scientific articles on political grounds, disruption of lectures abroad, cessation of collaborative efforts with colleagues abroad, refusal by such colleagues to take part in the promotion process their Israeli counterparts must undergo at local institutions, and even a sweeping boycott of local colleges and universities. The following examples, all from recent months and backed up by documents and emails, are being made public here for the first time. The plethora of events leaves no room for doubt: Israel is feeling the brunt of an unprecedented academic boycott, which is only gathering momentum.\n\nSimilar conclusions were evident in a survey conducted in January by the Israel Young Academy, an organization of young scholars that serves as an incubator for ideas and projects, which was founded in 2012 by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In that survey – of 1,000 senior faculty members at all of Israel’s institutions of higher learning – one-third of the respondents reported a significant slump in their ties with counterparts abroad. Some provided details. “A colleague in Europe informed me that she needs to remove the name of one of my former students from an article they co-authored, because her university is against any collaboration with Israel”; “My research partner requested that we not submit joint requests for grants to research foundations”; “A lab director with whom I have worked for many years said he finds it difficult to work with Israelis”; “A colleague in a European country received threats because he was collaborating with Israel,” and so on and so forth.\n\nThese comments were provided anonymously by the respondents and are in keeping with dozens of testimonies obtained by Haaretz. Together they create a picture of a frightening blow being dealt to Israeli academia, which is already being felt on the ground and is likely, primarily, to affect young scholars setting out on their careers. “People have severed ties with us – they have stopped responding to emails and have simply disappeared,” says Prof. Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi, a sociologist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Similar impressions have been expressed by many academic staff members.\n\n“A discourse of fear around maintaining contacts with Israelis is emerging,” relates R., a young Israeli who works in a lab in the field of the exact sciences at an elite university in England. His story is especially enlightening for understanding how Israeli academics like him are currently being received abroad.\n\nIn recent months, R. had suggested to the directors of his lab that they collaborate with universities in Israel. His proposal was rejected on the grounds that it is difficult to work with an institution located in a war zone if doing so essentially “benefits” only one side of the conflict. R. did not back down. He suggested allowing Israeli students to participate in a project involving remote learning. That attempt failed, as well. “The war is complicating things,” he was told, and “no one wants to take a risk.” The lab had already been “burned” in a similar case not so long beforehand, the directors explained, when sanctions were imposed on continuing associations with Russian researchers with whom they had been working.\n\n“The lab’s directors even asked me to remove the fact that I am from Israel from my profile on the university’s website,” R. says. “I consented. Not because I was asked to, but because I realized that it was in fact to my benefit.”\n\nBack in Israel,” he adds, “people find it hard to understand this, but we are two minutes away from getting the same treatment as Putin’s Russia.\n\nIsraeli academia is liable to find itself in a new situation regarding participation in conferences, fundraising for research or publication of articles. We are totally dependent on international connections. Collaboration with us will become increasingly difficult.\n\n* * *\n\nD. fights back tears. A young lecturer in the social sciences, she sees her career about to go down the drain. Like other academics, she chose to be interviewed anonymously here for fear that having her name published would burn her few remaining professional bridges. Some interviewees were concerned that using their names would hurt colleagues abroad or encourage the boycotters. Others were simply afraid.\n\n“I invested almost 20 years in studies and in gradually progressing in my field. But now the ability to continue with my work is very limited,” she says, adding that she feels pressure from multiple directions. “I am taking part in a large international project in Europe, together with other researchers from a number of countries,” she relates. “A few weeks ago, they asked me not to publish our joint studies on my website: The ties between us are harmful to them.” When she suggested joining a research workshop with her colleagues, the response was an unequivocal refusal. “Ethical considerations” do not permit any connection with an academic in Israel, she was told. “Ties with an Israeli researcher have become something considered to be illegitimate,” she sums up. “My future is limited.”\n\nIt once seemed as if the social sciences and humanities are more vulnerable to political struggles. Indeed, such departments in Israel were familiar with the impact of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement long before October 7. However, the cessation of collaboration – whether in conducting research, co-authoring articles or in other areas – is now being seen as a widespread phenomenon in all fields.\n\nA few months ago, Nir Davidson, a physics professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, suggested to an Italian colleague that they try together to request a grant from a competitive research foundation. “Because of the atrocities your country is perpetrating against innocent civilians, thousands of professors and researchers have signed a petition calling for all research collaboration to be blocked,” the colleague replied, noting that he “fondly recalls” a visit he made to Israel in 2020, but adding, “I’m afraid that what your country has done and is continuing to do will never be forgotten or forgiven.”\n\nAbout a month ago, a scientist from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev was ejected from an international group that submits research proposals to the European Union in the realm of environmental studies. The explanation he was given by one of his colleagues was, “I’m really sorry, but I’m going to have to not select Israel as a partner for the project. In fact, some partners do not wish to be involved in the project if Israel is a partner, particularly given the current political context. I am truly sorry, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to work together on another research project. Thank you for your understanding and I wish you all the best for the future.”\n\nAnother incident was cited by Ravit Alfandari, from the University of Haifa’s School of Social Work. She worked for over a year with a researcher from Northern Ireland on a large-scale study about domestic violence, and initially their collaborative effort continued after the war in Gaza broke out. “I understand you,” the Irish colleague told her, in one of their conversations. “I too know what it’s like to live under a threat.” But then, in November, just before they submitted a jointly written article to a highly regarded journal, he informed her that he had signed a petition calling for an academic boycott of Israel.\n\n“He was decisive,” Dr. Alfandari recalls. “He said, ‘I hold you in great esteem, but I don’t intend to work with you ever again. It’s not a temporary thing. You are committing genocide in Gaza.'”\n\nIn December, a literary scholar at Belgium’s KU Leuven University terminated a joint project with a scholar from the Hebrew University. “Our students are ‘very vocal’ on this subject,” the scholar wrote, explaining that someone had written on exam forms that were distributed in class, ‘Leuven – stop supporting genocide.'” In another case, an attempt by a Hebrew University professor in the social sciences to find an academic institution in Italy that would take part in teaching a joint course ended in disappointment.\n\n“I got a punch in the stomach from my longtime colleagues,” the Israeli scholar says. “There was a lot of squirming. On the one hand, they didn’t say ‘no’ to my face; on the other hand, it was actually ‘no’ with an exclamation mark.”\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Einat Metzl, head of the arts therapy program at Bar-Ilan University, was slated to visit a university in Los Angeles within the framework of leading a joint training program in her field, but the visit was canceled when three students objected to inviting a lecturer from Israel.\n\nA professor at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology told Haaretz about a student exchange program with a university in Denmark that was called off. Discussions about the program, which had reached an advanced stage in the months preceding the war, came to a halt in November. “The atmosphere changed, and was against us,” the professor says. “My counterpart said that it would be best to suspend the project. My impression was that he was afraid of his colleagues.”\n\nThe boycott of Israeli academia has also seeped into the field of business administration. A joint program in that field with an elite university in a large Western country was canceled a few weeks ago. Concern over anticipated anti-Israel demonstrations at the school was the off-the-record explanation.\n\nYet there are also cases of a reverse trend – of Israeli academics who have themselves decided to break their ties. “I had good relations for many years with the editor of a journal,” notes Prof. Michal Frenkel, from Hebrew University’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology. “Already on October 7 he complained about ‘unbalanced’ coverage in the world media. A few days later, he signed a letter calling for a boycott of Israel. He didn’t even wait until we entered Gaza. I resigned from the journal’s academic council. I couldn’t work with a person like that.”\n\n* * *\n\nAbout a month ago, Dan Mamlok, from the School of Education at Tel Aviv University, arrived in Montreal to deliver a lecture at a research center there. He was confronted by dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, most of them from the city’s McGill University, who blocked the entry of the attendees. “It was surprising and ironic to discover demonstrators against a lecture that dealt with education for tolerance in a polarized society,” he relates. “I came as a researcher of education – not as a representative of the Israeli government.\n\n“After a certain amount of effort,” notes Dr. Mamlok, who managed to get into the building and deliver the talk before a small audience, “the security guards succeeded in getting a few people in through the building’s cellar. Outside a demonstration took place, which was very audible in the room. In the end, three security men escorted me, and then I was driven to the hotel in a police car.” In light of stories like these, he says, he knows of many academics “who are considering canceling lectures [abroad], and some who have already done so.”\n\nLast week, Prof. Adam Lefstein, who heads the Seymour Fox School of Education at Hebrew University, organized a meeting for colleagues in his department in advance of their trips to conferences overseas. About 15 people attended the event, at which proposals for coping with possible disruptions were discussed.\n\nD. fights back tears. A young lecturer in the social sciences, she sees her career about to go down the drain. “Ties with an Israeli researcher have become something considered to be illegitimate,” she sums up. “My future is limited.”\n\nOne suggestion was to begin by talking about the war, including about criticism of it, “but also to say that we are here to talk about research,” Lefstein says. Another idea was “to display a presence” by attending one another’s sessions. “I don’t think one should be dragged into a shouting match,” Lefstein avers, “but sometimes it’s necessary to give lecturers the feeling that they are not alone.”\n\nIndeed, the specter of possible demonstrations against Israeli academics overseas has had a chilling effect. Prof. Netta Barak-Koren, from Hebrew University’s law school, currently on a sabbatical in the United States, was appointed to help colleagues in Jerusalem prepare for boycott-related scenarios. A few weeks ago, she says she organized a conference at a leading U.S. university that was only authorized following consultations with a long and unusual series of people – something she had already experienced elsewhere in recent months.\n\n“Suddenly universities are discussing the possibility of holding a conference in less prominent venues, or even after the end of the academic year, in order to avoid demonstrations. Our partners were very committed to organizing the [recent] event and holding it,” she says, but she says she is not sure that has been true in other cases.\n\nTo avert debacles, organizers of conferences abroad are canceling the participation of Israeli scholars in advance, but not the events themselves. A., who is in the field of the social sciences, was invited last summer by a European colleague to deliver a lecture at a local university later this year. “After October 7, she immediately took an interest in my well-being and expressed concern and sympathy,” she explains. About a month ago, the two started to plan the subject of the lecture – but then she was notified it had been canceled. It’s better to postpone the event indefinitely, because of the war in Gaza and the criticism it’s provoking among students, A. was told.\n\nMany academics note a significant decline in the number of scientific conferences they’ve attended in the last half year. There are a number of reasons for this, ranging from the problem of finding flights after the war broke out, to changes related to the timing and duration of the semesters, to difficulties in integrating socially in gatherings abroad at a time like this. At a conference of a social sciences association last November in North America, for example, most of the participants attached a sticker stating “Stop the Genocide in Gaza” to their name tags. At an international education gathering in Miami, in early March, a session focusing on “Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza” was held under the aegis of the organization’s president.\n\nAmong all these examples, one that stands out is a scientific conference of the Society for Free Radical Research International, scheduled to be held in Istanbul in June. But already in early February, the heads of the European branch of the society informed Moran Benhar, of the Technion’s Faculty of Medicine, that due to the war in Gaza, the government of Turkey had decided to bar Israeli scientists from taking part in the event, and nothing could be done about it.\n\nProf. Benhar: “They said that it was really unpleasant, but that the situation had been forced on them. I said that I didn’t think it was reasonable. Just as it was untenable for a country that had undertaken to host the Olympic Games to boycott another country, it was unacceptable for Turkey to decide who would attend an international conference being held on its soil.” In their conversation, the European heads of the organization repeated that they didn’t want to get into “political issues,” as that would create “a problematic precedent.” Benhar’s response was that their consent to bow to Turkey’s boycott policy was a far more dangerous precedent.\n\nAfter consulting with various colleagues, Benhar contacted a leading Jewish scientist at Harvard, who was due to receive a research prize at the Istanbul event. Within a short time, the scientist informed the organizers that he would not attend a conference that boycotted Israeli researchers. A few days later, the society’s directors announced that all the restrictions had been lifted.\n\n“I’m certain that the disconnect between Israel and other countries will happen in many areas,” says A., the researcher whose lecture was canceled in Europe. “We are only at the beginning of the road. I think people aren’t aware of the price we are paying and will continue to pay. Maybe we’ll wake up when we aren’t invited to the Olympic Games.”\n\nSimilar concerns are voiced by Prof. Yuval Feldman from Bar-Ilan’s school. “The process of a quite prestigious appointment abroad for myself was suspended this week because ‘this is not the most appropriate time,'” Feldman, who preferred not to be interviewed here, tweeted on X, on March 25. “I wonder whether we are encountering a new reality abroad that will not end even if the situation in Israel improves – a kind of genie that we won’t be able to put back into the bottle.”\n\n“I think we are a little like the canary in the mine,” Eran Toch, from Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Engineering, tweeted back. “The connection with the world is critical for Israel. We are not Russia. And academia stands on that front lines against the world.” Prof. Toch added that the process “will lead to a [wider] boycott of Israeli products, and that’s something everyone must take into account.”\n\n* * *\n\nIsraeli academics could perhaps have anticipated the problems they’re having during the war with collaborations with colleagues abroad and with conferences and lectures overseas. But what they did not expect was that publication of articles in academic journals – effectively, the bread and butter of the world of research – would also be affected. The processes of initial acceptance, peer review and publication of such articles are supposed to be neutral, professional and unbiased. But this is no longer always the case, as Israeli researchers are realizing.\n\nIn November, Liat Ayalon, from Bar-Ilan’s School of Social Work, submitted a short article to an academic journal where she had published in the past. The article dealt with the war’s impact on the situation of Israel’s elderly community. Shortly afterward, the editor, with whom she had worked for some two decades, called and asked her to withdraw the article. “He said that he could not send it out for peer review,” Prof. Ayalon relates. “He explained that the feelings in the United States against Israel were so strong that he was afraid that publishing the article would be detrimental to the journal.”\n\nIt was not a pleasant conversation: “He told me, ‘You know that I support you [Israel] and I’ve been to Israel four times, but I can’t publish it at this time.'” She was so astounded that she didn’t even argue with him at first. “I said, ‘Fine, if that’s what you want. I accept your opinion.'”\n\nA few days later, however, she had a change of heart and decided to write him.\n\n“I do think this is a slippery slope,” Ayalon wrote. “Right now the political sentiment does not allow to publish papers on older Israelis, but soon enough, it will be against having Israel as an affiliation (I am sure this is the case in some places already) and thereafter, it will be having a Jewish last name. I can’t imagine an American journal not publishing a paper on the effects of 9/11 on older people because of public sentiment, and although I don’t think that we should or could be comparing levels of suffering, the magnitude of Oct. 7 was 10 times greater given the size of the population.\n\n“Hence, I am just concluding by a) thanking you once again for being honest about this and b) saying that we should be careful because we (Israelis) are at the front, but unfortunately hatred and bigotry affect and will affect everyone.”\n\nThe editor ultimately backed down – but Ayalon had already submitted the article elsewhere. It was accepted within 24 hours, perhaps because the second editor was an even warmer supporter of Israel. “It looks as though at the moment everything is political,” she says.\n\n“Because of the atrocities your country is perpetrating against innocent civilians, thousands of professors and researchers have signed a petition calling for all research collaboration to be blocked,” an Italian colleague told Prof. Nir Davidson, “I’m afraid that what your country is doing will never be forgiven.”\n\nSomething similar happened to Prof. Rael Strous, director of the Mental Health Wing of Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center, in Bnei Brak. Strous, a professor of psychiatry at Tel Aviv University’s Sackler Faculty of Medicine, volunteered early on in the war to treat members of internally displaced families from the communities abutting Gaza who had been evacuated to Eilat. He wrote an article dealing with various aspects of his work there, from administering treatment in a hotel lobby packed with people, to coping with requests of patients to tell the world about the trauma they had undergone. “I didn’t think that was my task as a psychiatrist,” he says. “I treat people.”\n\nStrous submitted his article in November to a prestigious European journal and received positive feedback from one of the editors. Three weeks later, however, he was informed that the article had been rejected.\n\n“The author does not mention the larger context of the crisis they are discussing. By this I mean, they do not discuss the tens of thousands of Palestinians who continue to be killed, injured and psychologically traumatized in the current conflict,” an anonymous referee wrote. “The silence on this matter … is a form of epistemic injustice. That is, the author uses their position of privilege as a person with high-level academic training to erase the reality of Palestinian suffering from the narrative.”\n\nOne example cited by the reviewer was that “the author does not consider the danger posed to Palestinians” by the people he treated, “in the context of considerable evidence that Israeli settlers often undertake vigilante attacks against Palestinians.”\n\nStrous responded to the reviewer: “My paper had absolutely nothing to do with ‘Israeli settlers.’ The hotels where we practiced were on the opposite side of the country. The evacuees were not from areas anywhere near what some refer to as occupied territories where “settlers” live.” He added that this was proof that the “reviewer is clearly politically biased in his/her/their review.”\n\nThe psychiatrist appealed, and complained that the rejection of the article was “particularly unfair and disturbing.” Within a short time, the journal’s chief editor apologized and sent the article to a new peer reviewer. It was published his month. At the end of the abstract, a sentence was added saying that the paper was written from an Israeli viewpoint and the author acknowledges the suffering and psychiatric needs of Gazans. This was the journal’s suggestion, Strous notes, and he agreed.\n\nAn Israeli professor who also serves as a deputy editor at a highly regarded journal of psychology got a similar reaction. She receives articles from researchers worldwide and sends them on for professional review. In mid-February she sent an article by an American psychologist to a Spanish scholar – who refused to peer-review it.\n\n“I do not feel comfortable collaborating with nationals from a country which is committing war crimes,” the referee wrote. ” I hope that this state of affairs will soon come to an end, but, meanwhile, I want you to know that I will not be able to take any further request from you.”\n\nThe Israeli editor was flabbergasted. She doesn’t know either the author or the referee, and has no connection with the article itself.\n\n“I was very sorry to receive your email and to discover that you are associating a review request with accusations of war crimes,” she wrote back. “Needless to say, accepting or declining a review request is not a personal favor to any specific editor…Therefore, I find your response highly unprofessional and inappropriate.”\n\nIn another incident, physicist Nir Davidson of the Weizmann Institute submitted an article to a journal together with a scientist from Bar-Ilan. Along with professional comments, the referee wrote that he hopes “the situation in the strip of Gaza will become more ‘human’ as soon as possible. Mistakes have been made by both sides, but bombing is not the right way of addressing any problem (not even retaliation).” Davidson and his co-author wrote to the journal’s chief editor, who apologized. The article is still under discussion.\n\nReactions like this, open and documentable, are unusual. In many cases, the situation local academics face remains ambiguous, but no less disturbing. In early February, a professor at an Israeli university was informed that his article had been accepted for publication in a journal dealing with the exact sciences. However, the paper – after being cleared for publication by the editor and scientific reviewers – became stuck at the ultimate stage when it came under the scrutiny of the publisher.\n\n“No matter how many emails I sent, I didn’t get any response,” the author explains. “After a month, when I understood that no answer was forthcoming from the publisher, while other articles were being handled and getting published, I informed them that I was withdrawing the article. I submitted it to a different journal, and the whole process started over. I am a veteran member of the faculty. Neither I nor my colleagues can recall this sort of conduct.”\n\nProf. Mark Last, from Ben-Gurion’s Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering, submitted an article about artificial intelligence to an academic journal, together with two of his students, two months ago. “A few weeks went by and I got no response,” Last relates. “We hoped that the reason was that the article had been sent for refereeing. Then, last month, notification arrived that it had not met the requisite standards. I’d already received rejections of that sort, but usually a short explanation is added. I wrote to the chief editor asking for details. Within 24 hours, he wrote that he had reexamined the matter and had sent the article out for review. A few days ago the comments arrived; minor changes were needed.”\n\n“In November, I submitted an article to a journal that isn’t considered to be very competitive,” a social sciences professor tells Haaretz. “A week or so later I received a letter of rejection. They said they hadn’t even sent it for peer review, and in one laconic sentence declared that it didn’t meet their standards. I have almost 15 years’ experience and that has never happened to me. I wrote a long letter to the editors about how peculiar their behavior was. I wrote that it’s customary to at least add an explanation for the decision. I never received a reply.”\n\n“The most common way to discriminate against someone is to ignore them or provide a generic negative reply,” explains legal scholar Barak-Koren, one of whose main areas of research is discrimination. “Explicit rejections on a discriminatory basis are extremely rare. It’s easier, certainly via email, to ignore [people]. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the cases of explicit refusal we’re seeing are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader phenomenon, in which researchers receive generalized refusals and are ignored because they are Israelis.”\n\nThe boycott is severing our ability to be involved in the forefront of research. All scientific research that does not involve the international community is research that is less good. The severance from the world is suffocating us.\n\n* * *\n\n“I am writing to let you know that I have decided to step down from the Ph.D. committee [reviewing a student’s thesis],” a foreign social sciences scholar wrote the Hebrew University recently. “Following the university’s recent declaration of commitment to Zionism in the context of the war that is raging in Gaza, I feel I can no longer be associated with this institution. I have enjoyed working with you all and it is with a heavy heart that I am making this decision.”\n\nThe “commitment to Zionism” the professor cited was part of the fierce public condemnation the university issued against sharp remarks by Israeli-Palestinian Prof. Shalhoub-Kevorkian, of its law faculty, against Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza. “As a proud Israeli, public, and Zionist institution,” the university stated, it condemned her comments and suspended her, before reinstating her two weeks later.\n\nThe email from the foreign academic who asked to stop advising the Hebrew University doctoral student is only one example of an apparently growing phenomenon whereby scholars overseas no longer want to help prepare the next generation of lecturers and researchers at Israeli institutions: Sources at a few such institutions admit that they find it increasingly difficult to obtain the letters of evaluation from academics abroad that must be submitted in advance of discussions of staff promotions in Israel.\n\nFor the present, it looks as though the latter trend is particularly noticeable in the social sciences and the humanities: in sociology and anthropology, Middle Eastern studies and literature. But according to a source at one university, the field of law is also falling victim to such dwindling collaboration with foreign schools.\n\nSpecifically, Israeli academics seeking promotions at local universities must be assessed by means of surveys, if possible submitted by individuals at an elite university abroad. “There have always been refusals to referee, but in recent months there has been a rise in the phenomenon,” a source at one local university explains. In one case, requests were sent to 20 foreign experts, in two rounds. To date only one reply has been received. “It’s unprecedented,” the source says.\n\n“If the Israeli government commits irrevocably to either a two-state (within 1967 borders) or one-state solution in which all Palestinians in both Israel and the occupied territories have equal rights to Israelis – I will be happy to engage with Israeli institutions,” a senior researcher at a prestigious institution in Europe wrote recently, in response to a request to write an evaluation for an Israeli academic. “Until that day, no.” Another European academic wrote: “I do not believe that this suffering of civilians can be justified and I believe that Israel is not acting in accordance with international human rights law. In light of that, I feel I cannot collaborate with any Israeli institution at the moment.”\n\nCorrespondence of this sort is not generally publicized, but Philip Cohen, a professor of sociology and demography at the University of Maryland, decided otherwise. Two weeks ago, he explained in his blog why he had refused a request from the Israel Science Foundation to review a research proposal. “I believe the international community cannot permit the normalization of relations with the State of Israel in light of its actions in Gaza and the West Bank since October 7,” he wrote, adding, “In the absence of responsible state action by your government (or ours), I must instead do what I can to contribute to the diplomatic, political, and even scientific isolation of the state… I don’t know if my peers in Israel understand the extent of their global isolation.”\n\nIn November, Prof. Gili Drori, dean of Hebrew University’s social sciences faculty, took an unusual step. She decided to suspend the “external assessment” of all the faculty members who were seeking to be promoted. The reason: the concern that feedback by foreign referees would be colored by the war in Gaza. It’s difficult to think of a clearer manifestation of the deterioration in relations between Israeli academia and the international academic community. The suspension was, however, lifted three weeks later.\n\n“The dam has burst,” Drori declares now. “Talking about an academic boycott of scientists in Israel has become legitimate. It’s a whole new world. We are in a very extreme situation, and I don’t know whether and how it will be possible to reverse things. The boycott is severing our ability to be involved in the forefront of research. All scientific research that does not involve the international community is research that is less good. The severance from the world is suffocating us.”\n\nIf the pool of international experts who are willing to cooperate with Israel does continue to shrink, Israeli academics will face discouraging alternatives: to approach less senior academics from less well-regarded universities (which, according to a knowledgeable source, is already happening in some cases), or to increase the proportion of assessments provided by local faculty – not a particularly palatable solution.\n\n“Inbreeding in a family is not recommended, and it’s the same in academia,” says one source. “In the absence of fresh blood, academia degenerates.” The implication, he adds, is “a radical change in the process of promotion, which will affect the ranking of the institutions in international indices, where they examine, among other things, the potency of the promotion processes. If the refusal trend continues, we can give up the ambition of being the Harvard of the Middle East.”\n\nA number of universities and academic organizations in Belgium, Spain, Italy and Norway recently announced full boycotts or a suspension of ties with Israeli institutions until they receive clarifications with regard to topics ranging from the state of academic freedom on their campuses, to their moral, financial and material support for Israel’s defense forces. For one, Ghent University recently requested such information from its counterpart in Haifa.\n\nYet some heads of college and university administrations still take the view that the situation “hasn’t yet reached the point of no return,” as one puts it. “It’s too early to know how the process we are now involved in will unfold,” adds another. After all, new articles by local scholars are still being accepted for publication, research requests have been submitted and discussed abroad. But for one, Tel Aviv University President Ariel Porat says that, “there are too many people in academia [abroad] who see us as outcasts. There is no doubt that the numbers are large. I don’t remember a situation when entire universities sought to boycott us.”\n\n“The best-case scenario is that within a short time we will return to some sort of stability,” says American studies professor Milette Shamir, vice president of Tel Aviv University and director of its international academic collaborations. “Our standing in the world will be rehabilitated and we will be able to return to the situation we were in, to very extensive international activity.”\n\nBut Shamir acknowledges that she “doesn’t know whether that scenario is realistic.” Two weeks ago, she was in Australia to attend an academic fair at the University of Sydney. When she arrived, pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted that Tel Aviv University shares in crimes against the Palestinians and that all collaborations with Israel should end.\n\n“The worst-case scenario is that we are headed in the direction of South Africa [in the apartheid period],” she says, “with boycotts that keep mounting to the point of paralyzing the system. The result will be a mortal blow to Israeli academia. It will take on a provincial character and we will not be able to integrate into the forefront of the world’s research.”\n\n==========================================================\n\nhttps://en.globes.co.il/en/article-global-academic-community-snubbing-israeli-researchers-1001470960\n\nGlobal academic community snubbbing Israeli researchers\n\n12 Feb, 2024 11:57\n\nGali Weinreb\n\nA survey finds young Israeli researchers struggling to secure vital international collaboration, and that more wish to leave the country.\n\nInternational cooperation is part and parcel of science. Researchers depend for their advancement on peer reviews by their colleagues around the world. But when there are those in the academic world who perceive it as correct and moral to punish researchers for the policies of their countries, we are probably facing trouble in one of the most important areas for Israel’s economic strength.\n\nA survey carried out in December last year by The Israel Young Academy (founded by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities) and the Afik in Academia Israeli Women Professors Association, the findings of which have now been released, shows that this negative trend is being strongly felt. The survey, in which 1,015 senior faculty members from all the universities in Israel participated, reveals that many young researchers are already experiencing damage to international ties: to mutual visits, to join research work, and to the ability to recruit and keep international students. The researchers are not optimistic about the future. They expect substantial damage in many other areas, such as the ability to win research grants, to publish in professional journals around the world, and to collaborate with non-Israeli researchers.\n\n“As soon as the events occurred, it was clear to us that Israel’s academic ties had been damaged and would be damaged,” says Prof. Miri Yemini, a member of The Israel Young Academy and Professor of Education at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, who led the survey. “Within the first few weeks, I heard about someone who sent an article on medicine for publication, and was told ‘The article is about the Israeli population, and this is not the time to publish such an article.’ The editor of the journal wrote this to her explicitly.\n\n“I have also experienced several instances. I invited experts from all over the world to an international course that I run, and when the war started I asked them to appear at the course online. One of them, and it’s important to stress that it was only one, said that she could not participate in a course held under the logo of the Technion. ‘I like you, but I’m receiving threats from my colleagues in Britain,’ she said.”\n\nYemini makes clear that the explicit instances are few, and most of the damage is behind the scenes. “If, in a few years’ time, we measure a 5-10% decline in academic activity, it will be hard to know to what to attribute it, particularly when it occurs in a period in which there are budget cuts, or threats of budget cuts, at academic institutions, when in any case all researchers are experiencing difficult emotional and logistical challenges.”\n\nAccording to the survey, the damage is not the same across all disciplines. “We are seeing worse damage in the humanities and social sciences than in the exact sciences, engineering, and medicine,” says Yemini. “From the outset we got into this situation with inequality between the disciplines. In natural sciences, many of our researchers are at the top of their fields. In the social sciences and humanities this is less the case. These are disciplines that are more language-dependent, and when research is done on an Israeli population, it is anyway seen as a more niche study.\n\n“That doesn’t mean that we can give up on these disciplines. The damage is liable to be manifest later on, in education, in social work, in psychological health, and in all the areas that are so important to the country’s resilience and its recovery.”\n\nAnd if the feeling was that as time goes by since October 7 there is a trend of improvement vis-à-vis the international research community, Yemini makes clear that that is not the situation.\n\nFemale researchers worse affected\n\nIn addition to the damage to international ties, predictably, the researchers report economic and emotional damage and disruption to daily life. The greatest impact is of course the direct effect of the war, which is not unique to academic institutions. 11% reported that members of their research groups had been directly affected by the murder, injury, or abduction of people close to them.\n\nA far as the emotional, financial, and day-to-day harm is concerned, the impact is most felt by young researchers, especially those without tenure. That is not surprising, but this is the generation of researchers that is supposed to carry the universities and research institutes into the coming decades.\n\nFor researchers at the early stages of their careers, not only are the professional requirements tougher and the uncertainty great, they often have to look after small children and elderly parents at the same time. There is also gender inequality: young female researchers are more affected than men. The differences are marked in the three areas that were investigated: financial, emotional, and daily life. “Good science needs emotional and psychological space,” says Yemini. “You can’t do good science in quarter of an hour between things, or even in two hours.”\n\nAgainst this background, what happens to the desire to leave Israel? The survey presents an interesting finding. At the end of 2022, on a scale of zero to ten, the desire of researchers to leave was at 0.9. In March 2023 (after the announcement by Minister of Justice Yariv Levin of his judicial overhaul plan and the beginning of the protest movement against it) it rose to 3.4. It currently stands at 3.3. The researchers were asked what the level of their desire to leave was before October 7, and the average score was 2.92. That is, the desire to leave rose because of the judicial overhaul, faded slightly, and then rose again, but not to a level higher than after the judicial reform plan.\n\nAll the same, when respondents were asked whether they would accept a post at an elite university if it were offered to them, the score was higher, at around 4. This is interesting, since it was the elite universities that received the most publicity for allowing anti-Israel, and sometimes antisemitic, calls on their campuses. In seems that when the advantages of such a post – prestige, resources, connections, and the ability to do science at the highest level and receive recognition for it more easily – are weighed up, it seems a worthwhile proposition. Some of the researchers say they would want to bring these assets back to Israel later on.\n\nThose who carried out the survey did not suffice with mapping the situation. They also suggested possible ways of improving it, and asked the respondents to rank them. The help most in demand was funding for taking on students for higher degrees (including incentives for international students). The survey participants also sought funding for inviting overseas visitors, funding for publishing articles in journals so that they would be available for everyone to read (journals charge high fees for reading an article), funding of research using unique Israeli know-how, and training on how to deal with hostile responses and advocacy internationally. Proposals such as joint degrees with overseas institutions and training in social networks were ranked lowest.\n\n“Good science also requires money”\n\n“There is also an optimistic angle,” says Yemini. “I grew up in Ukraine, and there it was clear that the Jews had to be the best. My generation had to be the best pupil in town, because there was only room for one Jew in medical studies. I believe that at least some of the researchers will take up the challenge to be even better, so good that no excuse will be sufficient to reject us. For me, as someone who has been exposed to antisemitism in the past, it’s clear that that’s how the world works, and now we are all becoming aware of it. But we need backing from the government and from regulators, because good science also requires money.”\n\nCould it be that we will be strengthened by Jewish students fleeing from antisemitism on some campuses?\n\n“We can’t count on that. You can’t do ethnic science, and in any case their parents won’t necessarily rejoice at the idea of sending them to study in a country where an active war is taking place.”\n\n11.04.24\n\nEditorial Note\n\nUniversities in Canada saw a spike in anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incidents. IAM discussed this issue before.\n\nIAM reported in September 2020, “Canada’s Battles on anti-Israel Activities” on the battle over the directorship of the International Human Rights Program (IHRP) at the University of Toronto. Pro-Palestinian activists support the nomination of Dr. Valentina Azarova, known for her anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian views. Not surprisingly, Azarova had previously taught at Birzeit University, Palestine. Azarova’s nomination has been rescinded. However, the administration of the University of Toronto announced that Azarova was not officially a candidate.\n\nIAM reported in July 2022, “New Book on Anti-Israel Advocacy in Canada,” concerning several Canadian scholars who co-authored a book, Advocating for Palestine in Canada Histories, Movements, Action. IAM stated that, as has been the norm in pro-Palestinian academic circles, the book mainly focused on attacking Israel rather than discussing Palestinian issues.\n\nHowever, since the Black Sabbath of October 7, 2023, the amount of anti-Israel and antisemitic cases has skyrocketed in Canada and elsewhere. Concordia University has recently decided to tackle this issue. A few days ago, President Graham Carr informed the students by email that a new Task Force was created as a result of increasing identity-based violence on campus. Standing Together Against Racism and Identity-based Violence (STRIVE) was formed after a long period of tension on campus. For example, on Nov. 8, 2023, there was an altercation on campus between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students.\n\nAccording to the Concordia website, the STRIVE Task Force “aims to counter identity-based violence through campus engagement, consultations with all members of our community, open dialogue, education, and awareness.”\n\nAccording to the Concordia website, “Academic freedom and freedom of expression, core Concordia values, can only thrive when we make clear the distinctions between open and challenging discourse and expressions of threats, violence, and hatred against identifiable groups. Central to this task is the differentiation between identity-based violence, systemic discrimination, hate, and controversial speech. Racism and identity-based violence undermine the university’s commitment to respect, inclusion, and equality within our community. As a center of learning and production of knowledge, Concordia has a crucial role in addressing how identity-based violence creates barriers to full participation in our university community.”\n\nPresident Carr promised to notify the student body of STRIVE’s progress.\n\nA further examination of the Concordia website, however, finds a big surprise. Rachel Berger, Associate Dean, Academic Programs & Development, School of Graduate Studies, who is also a historian of medicine, food and the body in South Asia, is on the steering committee.\n\nBerger has a long history of anti-Israel activism. For example, on October 26, 2023, she signed a petition by “Artists & Academics in Canada: Statement of Solidarity with Palestine,” who pledged our “support for the Palestinian people in the face of over 75 years of Israeli apartheid, settler colonialism, military occupation, and ethnic cleansing.” The petition repeats the anti-Israeli tropes of Gaza being an “open-air prison, a place of brutal massacres and weapon testing“ and so on. Most egregiously, the petition notes that, “The militant reaction from Palestinians in Gaza on October 7, 2023, is a result of decades of cruel and oppressive treatment.” In other words, the savage attack of Hamas on Israeli civilians in which residents were killed, raped, dismembered, and burnt, in addition of being kidnapped, was justified. As the saying goes, “Israel made us do it.”\n\nThe petition even blames Canada’s founders: “Understanding the settler-colonial nature of Canada and its foundations on the theft of Indigenous land and life, it is not entirely surprising that Canada would defend siege, slaughter, and the theft of land. Yet, this has created an atmosphere of increased racism, policing, intimidation, and fear for Palestinians and their supporters in the settler colony of Canada.”\n\nIn the Spring of 2021, Berger was among a group “Jewish Faculty Against the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism.” As IAM reported, after the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) came out with a Working Definition of Antisemitism, which was widely accepted in the West, groups of pro-Palestinian academics mobilized to fight it.\n\nIn 2016, Berger was one of the initiators of the BDS call at Concordia, titled, “Simone de Beauvoir Institute’s Statement of Feminist Solidarity with the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement.” It stated that the representatives of the Simone de Beauvoir Institute (SdBI) “voted in unanimous support of the following resolution on the Palestinian call for the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement: As feminist scholars, activists, teachers, and public intellectuals we recognize the interconnectedness of systemic forms of oppression. In the spirit of this perspective, we cannot overlook the injustice and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, perpetrated against Palestinians and other Arabs in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, within Israel and in the Golan Heights, as well as the colonial displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba.”\n\nThe signatories of the imitative went on to state: “We share and are inspired by the values expressed by the December 2015 U.S. National Women’s Studies Association in their declaration of support for BDS and call for feminist solidarity with Palestinians. They state: “As feminist activists, scholars, teachers and intellectuals who recognize the interconnectedness of systemic forms of oppression, we cannot overlook the injustice and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, perpetrated against Palestinians. Following their lead, we similarly regard our resolution in support of BDS as ‘an act of transnational solidarity aimed at social transformation for a better world’.”\n\nOn March 14, 2015, Berger signed an “Open Letter: Defend Freedom of Speech,” which addressed the “university community regarding Palestinian Rights and Canadian Universities.” The letter argued that there have been “increasing efforts to limit advocacy of Palestinian rights in Canadian universities, amounting to a pattern of the suppression of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.” The undersigned, “Defend the right to freedom of speech about Palestine for all members of the university community, including freedom to use the term ‘apartheid’ to identify and debate certain policies associated with the state of Israel and the freedom to support, facilitate and participate freely in activities under the rubric of “Israeli apartheid week.” They also “Call for an end to the silencing of speech around Palestine, removing extraordinary requirements for security clearance and fees for security services.” And “Support increased ties to Palestinian institutions and scholars, and activities to support the right to education and academic freedom of Palestinians.”\n\nShe signed another Letter on August 10, 2014, published by a group named Canadians 4 Gazans, titled “Canadians for Justice and Human Rights in Gaza,” which stated that “Canadians call on the Government and federal political parties to condemn violations of international law in Gaza.” The group stated “We, the undersigned academics, professors, lawyers, community leaders, and prominent community members, are profoundly perturbed by the unbalanced and partisan position adopted by the Canadian Government and federal political parties regarding the current violence in Gaza… While Hamas’s indiscriminate rocket firings are illegal under international law, Israel is still bound by basic international humanitarian law principles protecting civilians during times of war and prohibiting collective punishment. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on civilian life and infrastructure in Gaza violate fundamental norms of international law… Multiple human rights groups have documented and condemned likely Israeli war crimes in Gaza… As a country claiming to champion universal human rights and dignity, Canada’s foreign policy must align with international law, and reflect the equal value of Palestinian and Israeli life. The callous devaluation of Palestinian life communicated by our political leaders does not represent us.”\n\nBerger was among the signatories of “Historians’ Letter to President Obama and Members of Congress” on August 28, 2014, demanding that the US change its policy toward Palestine/Israel, “In the face of the ongoing carnage in Gaza, members of Historians Against the War are circulating the letter.” It stated, “We deplore the ongoing attacks against civilians in Gaza and in Israel. We also recognize the disproportionate harm that the Israeli military, which the United States has armed and supported for decades, is inflicting on the population of Gaza. We are profoundly disturbed that Israeli forces are killing and wounding so many Palestinian children. Desperate conditions in Gaza resulting from Israeli policies have made effective evacuation of war zones virtually impossible. We regard as unacceptable the failure of United States elected officials to hold Israel accountable for such acts. As we watch the death toll mount and observe the terror of the trapped inhabitants in Gaza, we call upon you to demand a cease-fire, the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and a permanent end to the blockade so that its people can resume some semblance of normal life. We urge you to suspend US military aid to Israel, until there is assurance that this aid will no longer be used for the commission of war crimes. As historians, we recognize this as a moment of acute moral crisis in which it is vitally important that United States policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict change direction.”\n\nCanada adopted the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism, which would consider much of the content of Berger’s activism as antisemitic. This is deeply troubling because Concordia’s president created STRIVE to fight antisemitism. Therefore, Rachel Berger should not be allowed to serve on the Task Force.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nhttps://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/concordia-creates-new-committee-to-tackle-racism-on-campus\n\nConcordia creates new task force to tackle racism on campus\n\nThe university promises to create a safe campus for students of diverse backgrounds\n\nNEWSBRIEF Maria Cholakova — Published April 4, 2024\n\nOn April 3, Concordia President Graham Carr informed students by email that a new task force called Standing Together against Racism and Identity-based Violence (STRIVE) has been formed.\n\nThe creation of the task force comes after months of increasing tension on campus. On Nov. 8, 2023, a confrontation in the Henry F. Hall building between Israeli and Palestinian students turned violent. More recently, on March 13, a few students from the Muslim Student Association (MSA) expressed that they do not feel safe on campus, due to claims of Zionist students verbally harassing them on a regular basis. Several members of MSA accused students of calling them terrorists, pro-Hamas supporters and MSA terrorists.\n\nAccording to Carr, since October 2023, there has been an increase in “manifestations of hate, acts of intimidation and other instances of identity-based violence.” In his statement, Carr said these incidents are unacceptable.\n\nThe university created STRIVE as a result of increasing identity-based violence on campus. According to the university’s website, the task force will aim to address identity-based violence, strengthen anti-discrimination efforts and develop new policies and initiatives to combat discrimination at Concordia.\n\nThe task force will consist of one overseeing body and six subcommittees. Each subcommittee will consist of one lead and three members representing staff, students and faculty. The subcommittees will tackle key issues, including antisemitism, anti-Arab racism, Islamophobia, anti-Asian racism, transphobia, as well as campus climate and campus engagement.\n\nFor each subcommittee, the university will examine existing campus policies and systems in place for complaints. The university will also evaluate the community’s access to campus services and speak to the relevant Concordia and Montreal communities to deduce what measures are needed.\n\nAccording to Concordia’s website, the committees are seeking participants to join the task force.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the university has created a task force. Concordia currently has one task force, the Task Force on anti-Black Racism. Alongside the task force, Concordia also created a committee on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence in 2018—the latter of which has been heavily criticized by students. These criticisms involve being non-student-centric and unable to adequately deal with cases or listening to student complaints.\n\nCarr promises to notify the student body of any advancements or progress made by STRIVE.\n\n=====================================================\n\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/provost/initiatives/task-force-racism-identity-based-violence.html\n\nSTRIVE Task Force\n\nStanding Together against Racism and Identity-based Violence\n\nWhy a task force?\n\nConcordia’s President is striking a university-wide task force called STRIVE: Standing Together against Racism and Identity-based Violence. The STRIVE Task Force is a continuation of the university’s commitment to addressing systemic discrimination, identity-based violence, and hate on campus and beyond.\n\nAcademic freedom and freedom of expression, core Concordia values, can only thrive when we make clear the distinctions between open and challenging discourse and expressions of threats, violence, and hatred against identifiable groups. Central to this task is the differentiation between identity-based violence, systemic discrimination, hate, and controversial speech. Racism and identity-based violence undermine the university’s commitment to respect, inclusion, and equality within our community.\n\nAs a centre of learning and production of knowledge, Concordia has a crucial role in addressing how identity-based violence creates barriers to full participation in our university community. The Task Force aims to counter identity-based violence through campus engagement, consultations with all members of our community, open dialogue, education, and awareness.\n\nThe work of the STRIVE Task Force will be complementary to and aligned with the recommendations from both the Indigenous Directions Action Plan and the President’s Task Force on Anti-Black Racism.\n\nMandate\n\nThe mandate of the STRIVE Task Force is to oversee and coordinate the work needed to address identity-based violence as it manifests across the university.\n\nSTRIVE will assess and make recommendations to strengthen anti-discrimination efforts at Concordia, ensuring that we have the tools and structures in place to respond to a climate of increasing polarization while celebrating our diversity.\n\nTo do so, it will investigate, analyze and recommend the development of new policies and initiatives at Concordia, and assess ways to enhance existing institutional policies. Particular attention will be paid to existing informal and formal systems and practices of care and support, and how these can be bolstered.\n\nTo establish a global view, STRIVE will examine Concordia’s policies, teaching and administrative practices, and experiences of faculty, staff, and students. It will engage in wide-ranging consultation with the community as well as work with and consult internal and external partners.\n\nA comprehensive set of recommendations to combat identity-based violence at the university are to be submitted by the Task Force to the Provost.\n\nLeadership and structure\n\nThe work of the STRIVE Task Force will be led by a steering committee and six subcommittees.\n\nSteering Committee\n\nThe STRIVE steering committee is led by three co-chairs:\n\nRachel Berger, Associate Dean, Academic Programs & Development, School of Graduate Studies,\n\nRilla Shabnam Khaled, Associate Professor, Design and Computational Arts and Associate Director of Technoculture, Arts & Games (TAG), and\n\nLisa White, Executive Director, Equity Office\n\nThe steering committee will take a holistic approach to its work of understanding specific forms of identity-based violence and identifying counter-strategies. It will also examine the workings of the university in relation to identity-based violence on campus.\n\nIn addition to the co-chairs, the steering committee membership will include the following members:\n\nUndergraduate student\n\nGraduate student\n\nAlumni\n\nFull-time Faculty\n\nPart-time Faculty\n\nStaff (2)\n\nSubcommittee leads\n\nIn addition to members, the steering committee will include administrative and communications support.\n\nSubcommittees\n\nTo best examine and address the university’s needs in relation to the overt and covert forms of identity-based violence within our institution, the Task Force will conduct its work through subcommittees according to six initial focus areas:\n\nCampus Engagement\n\nAntisemitism\n\nAnti-Arab racism and Islamophobia\n\nAnti-Asian racism\n\nTransphobia\n\nCampus Climate\n\nEach area will be examined in depth and with careful attention to specificity and intersectionality (for example, appropriation, fetishization, hate, exclusion, erasure) as well as in juxtaposition with each other and the broader university context.\n\nThe subcommittees, also composed of faculty members, staff, students, and administrative leaders, will examine and make recommendations on targeted areas of concern. Wherever pertinent, the subcommittees will consult the broader Concordia community to address the identified concerns as fully as possible. The Office of the Provost will provide administrative support to the Task Force for its mandate.\n\n==============================\n\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/provost/initiatives/task-force-racism-identity-based-violence/engagement.html\n\nEngage with STRIVE\n\nFollowing President Carr’s announcement regarding the STRIVE (Standing Together against Racism and Identity-based Violence) Task Force, the university community is invited to participate in the effort to create a diverse and representative group from across the university.\n\nCall for subcommittee members\n\nThe STRIVE Task Force is looking for members for each of its six subcommittees:\n\n-Campus Engagement\n\n-Antisemitism\n\n-Anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia\n\n-Anti-Asian racism\n\n-Transphobia\n\n-Campus Climate\n\nEach subcommittee will consist of one lead and three members representing staff, students, and faculty.

Denouncing “Israeli apartheid, settler colonialism, military occupation, and ethnic cleansing,” the letter urges Israel to cease its ongoing bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which has killed over 7,000 Palestinians to date and displaced half of the region’s population.\n\n“We understand that the events of [October 7] did not occur in a vacuum,” reads a letter authored by Artists for Palestine – Canada, reproduced in full in English and French below. “For two decades, Israel has held Palestinians in Gaza under siege, in an open-air prison, subjecting them to brutal massacres and weapons testing; depriving them of basic goods, food, clean water, medicine, and medical supplies.”\n\nIn recent weeks, since the Hamas militant group attack that killed 1,400 Israeli people, Israel has launched a barrage of air strikes and a complete siege on the Gaza Strip — an enclave home to roughly 2.3 million people, half of whom are children, who have been living under an Israeli blockade for over 18 years. The signatories of Artists For Palestine – Canada’s letter pledge to refuse professional invitations and funding from institutions linked to the Israeli government until it “complies with international law and universal principles of human rights.”\n\n“As artists, cultural workers, and academics, we stand strong in support of the Palestinian struggle for freedom and against all forms of racism and settler-colonial violence,” the authors write.\n\nRead Artists for Palestine – Canada’s letter, reproduced in full, below.\n\n________________________________\n\nArtists & Academics in Canada: Statement of Solidarity with Palestine\n\nWe, the undersigned artists, academics, and cultural workers, pledge our support for the Palestinian people in the face of over 75 years of Israeli apartheid, settler colonialism, military occupation, and ethnic cleansing.\n\nWe understand that the events of this week did not occur in a vacuum. For two decades, Israel has held Palestinians in Gaza under siege, in an open-air prison, subjecting them to brutal massacres and weapons testing; depriving them of basic goods, food, clean water, medicine, and medical supplies. Since 2000, more than 135,000 Palestinians have been detained by Israeli forces, including 21,000 Palestinian children and hundreds of academics, artists, journalists, human rights defenders, and parliamentarians. Peaceful protests continue to be met with Israeli sniper bullets. Palestinian journalists are targeted for bringing us news on the ground, as in the case of longtime Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot in the head by Israeli forces while covering Israeli attacks on Jenin refugee camp last year.\n\nPalestine solidarity supporters and Palestinians around the world, particularly in the US, Canada, and Europe, are being criminalized, intimidated, imprisoned, facing unprecedented levels of anti-Palestinian racism and incitement of violence. This year, Israel’s far-right government implemented a criminal policy that legalized raids of Palestinian cities and villages across the West Bank and Jerusalem, reaching a record high of Palestinian deaths and arrests without charge or trial. The whole world understood in the case of Ukraine that resistance to military occupation is justified. It is in fact a right guaranteed by international law. The militant reaction from Palestinians in Gaza on October 7, 2023, is a result of decades of cruel and oppressive treatment.\n\nAs the Israeli regime flattens entire neighborhoods in the besieged Gaza Strip, where nearly half of the 2.3 million-person population are children, over 1400 Palestinians have been killed, including 447 children, over 6,000 injured, and over 340,000 internally displaced (Palestinian Ministry of Health as of Thursday, October 12). As the illegal bombardment continues, we call on all people of conscience to show their meaningful solidarity with Palestinians.\n\nWe are disappointed and ashamed by the response of the Canadian government, elected representatives, and institutions, who have once again voiced their overwhelming support for apartheid Israel and legitimized the ongoing shelling of Gaza and the escalation of military violence in the West Bank. Understanding the settler-colonial nature of Canada and its foundations on the theft of Indigenous land and life, it is not entirely surprising that Canada would defend siege, slaughter, and the theft of land. Yet, this has created an atmosphere of increased racism, policing, intimidation, and fear for Palestinians and their supporters in the settler colony of Canada.\n\nHow must Palestinians in Ottawa have felt to see the Israeli flag projected on Parliament Hill while Israel dropped internationally banned white phosphorus in residential neighborhoods of Gaza, promising to “open the gates of hell”? What message does that send to Palestinians? Voices of conscience are publicly scolded and defamed, suggesting to Palestinians among us that they cannot voice their grief in public. In attacking political and labor leaders who have voiced their support for Palestinians, the Canadian government has built an environment of fear and fueled acts of discrimination against Palestinians and their supporters.\n\nAs Israel commits war crimes with overwhelming evidence and documentation, mainstream media has catered to the heavy propaganda campaign launched by Israel and facilitated by Western governments and media. Failing to document the war crimes of the Israeli regime or the suffering of Palestinians, and proliferating racist claims from Israel without substantiation, Canadian media is contributing to the dehumanization of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and beyond and manufacturing consent for the ongoing massacres.\n\nAs artists, cultural workers, and academics, we stand strong in support of the Palestinian struggle for freedom and against all forms of racism and settler-colonial violence. In response to the open call from Palestinian artists and cultural workers for a cultural boycott of Israel, we pledge to accept neither professional invitations to Israel, nor funding, from any institutions linked to its government until it complies with international law and universal principles of human rights. Without international ground-up pressure through the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, the Israeli regime will continue to practice apartheid and commit crimes against the Palestinian people unhindered.\n\nIt is easy to look back at history and recognize right from wrong, but it takes bravery to speak for justice in the present moment. Join us in taking a principled stand. Apartheid is a security threat to all, and none of us are free until all of us are free.\n\nSigned:\n\nCollective/Organizational Signatories\n\nIntima2 Program (20 members) for Artists practicing
