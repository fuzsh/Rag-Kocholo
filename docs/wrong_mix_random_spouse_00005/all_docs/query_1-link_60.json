        "text": "By 2020, a date no further into the future than Martin Luther King’s assassination is in the past, the number of US residents who are Hispanic or nonwhite will have more than doubled, to nearly 115 million, while the white population will not be increasing at all. By 2056, when someone born today will be 60 years old, the “average” US resident, as deemed by the census statistics, will trace his or her descent to Africa, Asia, the Hispanic world, the Pacific Islands, Arabia—almost anywhere but white Europe. Educating, training, and managing this increased work force diversity is already posing a tremendous challenge for educational institutions as well as other governmental, industrial, and ma jor business organizations throughout the United States.\n\nThis chapter outlines the cultural-historical context that informs the depth and breadth of the construction of difference based on race, class, language and ability and multicultural education in the United States today. It first highlights the history of multicultural movement from the early twentieth century to the present. The authors examine demographic changes that underscore a need for national policies to address diversity and new populations including policies that account for immigrants who constitute an increasingly diverse and skilled global citizenry. Then, the chapter reviews the ways in which education scholars have conceptualized culture and multiculturalism in United States. The authors argue educators must understand the history and cultural contexts of students’ lives in order to develop a multicultural classroom and curriculum. Lastly, the chapter presents two successful education programs for youth from historically marginalized culturally and linguistically diverse background: The Migrant Student Leadership Institute and Learning Lab. The authors recommend educators pursue multicultural curricula and programming as a means to foster debate and dialogue about the importance of students’ active participation in a democratic and inclusive society."
