        "text": "Frank Rizzo, writing for Variety wrote that “with a tuneful score, a playful book, and performances that remind you what Broadway heart and chutzpah are all about, this cause célèbre of a show turns out to be a joyous, funny, and sweet production that should appeal to several generations of musical fans.”\n\nNew York Magazine’s Sara Holdren wrote: “There’s such genuine joy rolling off the stage in The Prom that you’re ready and willing to forgive its minor misfires... Did I shed several real tears in The Prom’s final scene? Maybe I did… I also seldom stopped laughing. The show is full of witty delights.”\n\nAdam Feldman of Time Out Magazine gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, saying “It is cheering to see a musical comedy that engages with modern questions, with a teenage lesbian romance at its center to boot... But while the issues are contemporary, there is a 1980s feel to the character types and the overall style of Chad Beguelin and Matthew Sklar’s score, which resembles their work in The Wedding Singer.\n\nIn The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the show “one part satire, packed with delicious theatrical in-jokes delivered with aplomb by game stage veterans playing caricatures of themselves; and one part inclusivity teaching moment, reminding us there's a place for everyone beneath the Mylar balloons at a high school dance, even in conservative Indiana.”\n\nThe original Broadway production garnered six Tony Award nominations, five Drama Desk nominations (winning Outstanding Musical), four Outer Critics Circle Awards nominations, and two Drama Leagues Awards nominations.\n\nSo love whom you love, and let’s dance at the prom Broadway-style at this heart stopping and heart wrenching show, July 26 – August 11, 2024.\n\nThere are three ways to be a part of our star-studded evening:\n\nOption 1: Cocktails (on the Playhouse Patio), Dinner (in the Bok Gallery) and the Show (on the MainStage in The Bobbie Olsen Theatre)\n\nOption: 2: Cocktails and the Show\n\nOption 3: Just the Show\n\nThere will also be a silent auction and a paddle raise during the Dinner.\n\nFor reservations and pricing options, visit https://www.sharonplayhouse.org/spotlight-gala.\n\nAs the theme suggests, the Gala is dedicated this year to Bobbie Olsen, former president of The Sharon Playhouse Board of Directors and namesake of our main stage, The Bobbie Olsen Theatre.\n\nA bit about our dear Bobbie: Bobbie, a resident of Salisbury, is a huge theater fan, dating her earliest experiences to playing the Queen of Hearts in second grade. Bobbie grew up in California and spent summers in New York. Once bitten by the “theater bug,” she starred in high school theater productions and immersed herself in college theater as a critic. After college, Bobbie’s day job was advertising copywriting; during the evenings, you could find her with standing room tickets for whatever caught her fancy (don’t tell anyone she used to sneak into an empty seat during intermission).\n\nIn New York, Bobbie has been a board member of The York Theatre and The Manhattan Theatre Club. She is also a board member of The Riverside Theatre in Vero Beach, Florida. A huge advocate for children’s involvement in and exposure to live theater, Bobbie is thrilled with the expansion of The Sharon Playhouse’s Youthstage Theater Program. Bobbie also champions the development of emerging playwrights and new works.\n\nCome celebrate Bobbie’s myriad accomplishments and contributions to our theater-loving community in what promises to be a great evening of live theater. There’s nothing like it!\n\nMy first Broadway show was the opening night of Big River on April 25th, 1985. It was such an event! The set, music, and voices were all so marvelous. I think it won best show that year. I’ll never forget it!!\n\nJohn Champion is a part time resident of Sharon.\n\nIn 2005, I had the pleasure of working with Matthew Morrison (TV’s Glee) on a fundraiser for Broadway Cares, Equity Fights AIDS. At our rehearsal, he handed me a pair of tickets with an invitation to see him in his next role as Fabrizio in Light in the Piazza at Lincoln Center. Matthew played opposite Kelli O’Hara as Clara, a beautiful young woman who, due to a juvenile brain injury, looked at the world through a kaleidoscope of innocent love. Fabrizio was a gentle, loving soul who basked in Clara’s childlike light. This led the pair to fall hopelessly in love. I adored every moment of the production -- the acting, the staging, the arrangements, the ‘50s costuming. It was a wonderful rendition of Elizabeth Spencer’s novel; a skillfully woven tale of romance, naïveté, and parental love.\n\nTrisha McMahon is a freelance writer living in Washington, CT. She was the founding editor of iN New York magazine and Senior Vice President of Communications for WHERE Traveler.\n\nEasily the most consequential theater experience in my life was going to see West Side Story in September 1957. It was a brand-new musical and while I'd gone to plays before, nothing was like this. I was born and raised (and still live) on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. What I saw that night was the energy, exuberance, conflict, pain, love and passion that reflected all the emotions that we experienced daily on the streets of the City, Moreover, it was all done in under two hours with a dynamism and skill that was breath-taking. I couldn't stop thinking and talking about it and it made me a life-long fan of the theater. The music has become iconic and to this day I think it's the most exciting play I've ever seen.\n\nPeter Bakstansky is a theater buff and part-time Warren resident.\n\nGuys and Dolls is a personal favorite and was the first musical I performed in at The Sharon Playhouse. Filled with Damon Runyon characters, it gave New York in the bygone 30s its own kind of magic. Frank Loesser's lyrics for “Adelaide's Lament—A Person Can Develop a Cold” or “Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat” are nothing short of brilliant. The recent performance at The Sharon Playhouse with heavy tap was fabulous. Love that show!\n\nBette Halby is an artist/sculptor (BetteKlegonHalby.com) and part time Cornwall resident.\n\nWhile I’ll always have a soft spot for Spring Awakening, in which I played Melchior at The Sharon Playhouse in 2014, I’d have to say my favorite musical would be Dear Evan Hansen. I saw it first on Broadway with Ben Platt, and it was a truly remarkable experience. The entire cast was excellent, but Platt’s performance was something special and I wasn’t surprised at all when he won Best Actor. I still listen to the album, and made sure to see it again on Broadway, when it reopened after COVID. Every cast brings their own take on the characters, but the result is always a poignant, modern and thoroughly enjoyable theater experience.\n\nChristian Lange is a member of The Sharon Playhouse Board of Directors and a resident of East Canaan.\n\nMy husband and I had the pleasure of attending the production of Guys and Dolls several years ago at The Sharon Playhouse. It was truly beautiful and professional. While the original show may have had its debut on Broadway in 1950, the story, the characters and songs are evergreen to us. We would love to see a sequel with the Nathan Detroit, Miss Adelaide and Sky Masterson characters. We feel incredibly lucky to have such a wonderful theater in our community”.\n\nArlene and Jon Glantz are part-time residents of Washington, CT. Arlene is the founder of A.Glantz,Inc. (aglantzinc.com) luxury diamonds and gemstones.\n\nIn the early '50s my best friend’s mom took us on a train from our home in Poughkeepsie to New York City to see a Broadway show called Wish You Were Here. It was one of the most exciting times of my young life. The only thing we knew about it was that our beloved romantic hero of the time, Eddie Fisher, had made the song popular and it was Number One on the hit parade. The music and lyrics were by Harold Rome and the story about Camp Karefree, a vacation resort in the Catskill Mountains, where families would go for week-long holidays and the staff would mingle to give everyone a good time. Since then I have seen hundreds of musicals. That's probably what led me to becoming an actress and cabaret performer.\n\nThayer Hochberg is a Washington resident and former actress and cabaret performer.\n\nIn 1983 my uncle took me to Carnegie Hall on New Year's Eve to see a gala benefit concert. The grandeur of the Hall and the performance by Yo-Yo Ma were unforgettable. At age 12 the performance set me on a life-long appreciation for New York City and all it had to offer a kid from a Pennsylvania steel town.\n\nJames Neunzig is the chef and owner of Giffords Catering and J.P.
