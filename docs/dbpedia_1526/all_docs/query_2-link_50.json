He would gurgle and just be delightfully happy. I was just watching how carefully she nurtured him.”\n\nWhile accompanying her daughter on a business trip to England, Brown took care of her grandson during the day, which is also when she became inspired to write about him.\n\nSo far, Brown has written six out of 10 books in the “Adventures of Alfie” series. The third is titled “Baby Alfie Goes to London.”\n\nAll of the books are based off encounters that Brown has had with her grandson.\n\n“It’s a legacy that I’m leaving behind for him,” she says.\n\nCopies of the first instalment are available for purchase through online bookstores Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Indigo and can also be found at the Regina Public Library. An official book launch is to be held at the Central Library on Feb. 29.\n\nBrown retired early to help raise her grandson while also continuing her artistic pursuits and community work as board chair of SACHM.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Right now I’m so busy with all of the endeavours and the activities that I have going on throughout the city,” she says.\n\nBrown got involved with SACHM because of her daughter, who in 2013 was the first Black woman to be crowned Miss World Canada and the first woman from Saskatchewan in 50 years to win the title.\n\nBrown has been working with SACHM ever since, serving in various capacities on the board prior to becoming chair in 2017.\n\nDuring her tenure with SACHM, Brown has been instrumental in planning and organizing many events, including the launch of Black History Month in Saskatchewan.\n\nSACHM began as an informal organization in 2002, but its status as a non-profit corporation was formalized two years later.\n\nSACHM’s primary purpose is to celebrate, explore, research, and document the heritage and contributions of people with African ancestry. The organization helps people preserve and gain access to information about their history and encourages them to embrace their heritage. SACHM also works to raise public awareness about the role that people of African ancestry played in settling and developing the province.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn 2023, Brown was a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal and Certificate for her contributions to Saskatchewan.\n\nA month after receiving the award, Brown was the guest speaker at the Enhanced Canadian Citizenship Ceremony, where she watched candidates become Canadian citizens.\n\nBrown, a professional opera singer and voice-over artist, has worked with the Regina Symphony Orchestra for the last two years as a narrator for the story “Li’l Shadd: A Story of Ujima.”\n\nThe production is part of RSO’s educational school programming. The next performance is to be held at the Holy Rosary Cathedral on Feb. 19 for the Wascana Winter Festival.\n\n“Since I’ve been singing and studying classical music for many years, and this narration to classical music is very intricate work, they wanted someone who understands it,” says Brown.\n\nThe performance is based on a book about an African Canadian doctor who works with Indigenous people and is required to see a patient on his son’s birthday. The son struggles to understand why helping people is more important than his birthday party and decided to tag along with his father. The book was written by Miriam Korner and Alix Lwanga while the script was adapted by Harrison David Rivers and set to live music.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBrown began singing at age nine and studied opera at the University of Regina, Conservatory of Performing Arts.\n\nIn the past, she has performed at Government House and the Conexus Arts Centre for Black History Month events. She was the opening performer at the 2017 Measha Brueggergosman’s Songs of Freedom concert.\n\n“My voice is very baroque in nature,” says Brown, adding that she sings in English, French, Italian, Spanish and German. “I just love that sound … and, with my love for classical music, I was just settled in that period.”\n\nBrown’s voice studies began with Wilma Bell-Wessel of Regina and continues periodically under the tutelage of Valerie Hall from the U of R’s Conservatory of Performing Arts.\n\nWhile many of Brown’s family members live in New York City, she has chosen to stay in Regina, the place where she grew up.\n\nWhen asked about her favourite aspects of Regina, she says it’s the people.\n\n“Because this place is my home, I’ve felt very accepted here. I remained here through lots of ups and downs,” says Brown. “I have found a really comfortable niche where I can perform, communicate, and partner and do all the wonderful things that I want to do with the people here.\n\n“I’ve met so many friends within this community and I’m happy that I’ve stayed here and I’ve called Regina home.”\n\nAnAmato@Postmedia.com\n\nWith some online platforms blocking access to the news upon which you depend, our website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark leaderpost.com and sign up for our newsletters here so we can keep you informed.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
