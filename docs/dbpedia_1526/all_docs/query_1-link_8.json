        "text": "One of the important aspects of Black History Month is that itâs not just about what happened 50, 100, 200 years ago. Itâs also about the present, the world around us and whatâs happening now to bring greater representation and celebration of African-American accomplishments and contributions. Of course, we should recognize and respect what has come before us. Black history is an integral part of American history and culture. But itâs also important to recognize the lives and experiences of those we meet and work with everyday.\n\nSharon Catherine Brown, or ShayCat as I came to know her during our recent production of Anne of Green Gables, is someone with such a rich history of experiences and a wealth of knowledge and insight from her 45 years as an actress and singer on both stage and screen, notably in TV shows with all-black casts like Good Times, The Jeffersons, and A Different World. It is a surety of herself and confidence in her actions that makes her someone to admire and applaud. Not because sheâs better than you or me, not because sheâs got it all together (which she'd be the first person to admit that's not the case), but rather because she is one of us, sheâs gone through her own challenges and felt the ups and downs of this career and has come through them a better performer and a better person.\n\nSTORY #3 - a actor's nightmare experience onstage in Flora, The Red Menace\n\nEXTRA- milestone TV shows she was a part of with all-black casts & the importance of knowing our worth as actor\n\nListen to PART 1 of my conversation with Sharon.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO WINMI\n\nGet access to Audition Stories, the Final Five questions, and other bonus content by becoming a monthly or yearly subscriber to Why Iâll Never Make It.
