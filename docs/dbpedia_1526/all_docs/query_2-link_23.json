        "text": "Sharon Brown Standridge was born in Denver, Colorado and grew up in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, and later, on the open plains of Nebraska. Her grandfather, father, and his five siblings were known as Tex Brown and His Little Buckaroos, the world’s youngest rodeo performers. Following the path of her rich western heritage, childhood memories of American West landscapes, and love and respect for the people of days gone by.\n\nA heart for the people and places of the West, Sharon has found expression through the vivid authenticity of her art. “I am drawn to painting the American West, especially the era of the 1860–1890s,” she says. “People are my preferred subjects; sometimes cowboys, sometimes pioneer women and children. Most recently, my focus has been the Native Americans of the Plains—painting the daily tasks and duties of the women of the plains and the adventures and challenges of the young braves and warriors. Through the years I have acquired a collection of clothing and accouterments of that time period. And I have made some of the clothing for my models as well. With each new painting there is always something added to the collection, to further tell the story that I will be painting.”\n\n“In setting up a scene for a painting, I typically hire models, and have sometimes used my family for my models. What motivates and excites me to paint is the drama of the spectacular light and shadow on the figures. Planning the day of the photo shoot I always hope for a sunny day and strive for a great sun lit location.”\n\nThis will be Sharon’s 14th year to be participating in the Desert Caballeros Western Art Museum’s Cowgirl Up! Art from the other Half of the West.\n\nSharon and her husband, David, have been long-time residents of North Texas, where her home and studio overlook the beauty and tranquility of Lake Bridgeport."
