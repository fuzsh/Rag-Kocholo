        "text": "In an enjoyable BroadwayCon encounter this past summer, I found myself in the heart of all things Broadway, rubbing shoulders with the stars and hosting live interviews for the Broadway Podcast Network. While my conversation with Jelani Alladin about Frozen and Hercules was already shared in a previous episode, today we delve into my interview with the talented Broadway actress Sharon Catherine Brown.\n\nI had the pleasure of working with her on a new musical last year, and we dive into some of the other shows on her resume, with a primary focus on her role in Jekyll & Hyde. We'll also explore her contributions to iconic musicals like Dreamgirls and Caroline, Or Change, gaining valuable advice for aspiring performers along the way. Join me in this special episode recorded live at BroadwayCon 2023 for an insightful and entertaining conversation with the remarkable Sharon Catherine Brown.\n\nINTRO - What she looks for when auditioning for roles and shows\n\nSTORY #1 - Tackling the demanding role of Lucy in Jekyll & Hyde\n\nSTORY #2 - Playing such iconic characters as Dorothy in The Wiz and Effie in Dreamgirls\n\nSTORY #3 - Why she never gives advice to others on how to make it to Broadway\n\nEXTRA - What it was like working with Andre Deshields\n\nSubscribe or Donate to WINMI\n\nProducing this podcast is a rewarding experience, but it's also costly and time-consuming as Iâm essentially a one-man operation.
