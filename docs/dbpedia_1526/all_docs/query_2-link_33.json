        "text": "Over the years, she came back to visit family and perform concerts in the city, even though her dynamic voice also took her to far-flung, international destinations; she always found her way back to the small, southern place of her earliest memories. Eventually, she bought a home not far from where she grew up in North Augusta, a simple place to rest in familiarity between concerts and events.\n\nWhile a young woman, working as many jobs as should could manage to support her mother and siblings, Sharon Jones continued to sing her heart out, entering funk band talent shows and eventually sharing her talent with a Sony record executive. Scoffing, the man told her that she was \"too fat, too black, too short, and too old,\" to be a star and sent her on her way. Jones vehemently disagreed with the executive's assessment, and his negativity soon became fuel for the fire within her, feeding her determination to share her talent with the world. In between her shifts as a correctional officer at Riker's Island and armored car guard for Wells Fargo, Jones utilized her vocal talent by singing at weddings and providing backup vocals for other artists.\n\nIn 1996, Jones got her lucky break. Out of three singers called by Desco Records to provide background vocals for a Lee Fields album, Sharon Jones was the only one to show up. True to form, Jones deftly handled the challenge, cutting all of the background parts herself and shocking the record producers with her range and talent. Jones became a mainstay at Desco records, singing behind and alongside many famous soul and funk talents, and releasing her own singles through the label. When Desco Records folded in 2000, co-owner Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Man) and Jones sourced some of the most talented musicians they knew to create a new group: Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings. Together, the team began to make some of the best soul music this side of the century. By 2002, a new label, Daptone Records, had formed, and the group released its first album - called \"Dap-Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,\" fronted by the intense and powerful voice of Miss Sharon Jones. Now in her forties, Jones had finally become the star she was so destined to be.\n\nAs time went on, Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings rose to success, while Jones turned up the talent, the toughness, and the dedication to her craft. The group, who quickly became known as a \"family,\" wrote songs together, produced music videos, and toured internationally. Concerts were often sold out, with audiences entranced and inspired by Jones: oft-barefoot, hair swinging, jumping and jiving all over the stage with more energy than one could imagine resided in her petite frame, earning her unofficial title as \"The Female James Brown.\" Adored by her fans, Jones embraced her stardom, almost never turning down an opportunity to share what she believed was her God-given talent."
