        "text": "Sharon Brown '73 and her late husband, Terry Kabanuck, enjoyed traveling together and made annual trips to Hawaii.\n\nSaint Martin's University alumna Sharon Brown established the Sharon Brown and Terry Kabanuck Study Abroad Scholarship Endowment at Saint Martin's University this past year. Sharon has also generously named Saint Martin's University as a beneficiary of a portion of her estate.\n\nSharon gifted this generous scholarship to provide support for Saint Martin's students studying abroad because she and her late husband, Terry Kabanuck, firmly believe that travel enriches one's educational experiences and knowledge.\n\nSharon adds, \"Like many Saint Martin's students, I attended on a financial aid package that included scholarships and work study. Over the years I've occasionally made small contributions to the school but always wished I could do more. Losing my husband forced me to re-examine my priorities and I decided that I want to give back to the place that gave me so much. Besides my education, I made so many lifelong friendships and have a much broader worldview based on the Benedictine values.\"\n\nSharon grew up in Yelm, Washington. She graduated from Saint Martin's University (then College) in 1973 with a degree in English Literature. During her years at Saint Martin's, Sharon worked in the library and served as yearbook staff and co-editor. After graduation, Sharon spent time as an educator, but most of her career was spent working for the IRS, where she met her late husband.\n\nTerry grew up in Seattle, graduated from Seattle University and went on to earn his law degree from Willamette University. He was also an Army Reservist for 28 years and was an avid Seattle sports fan.\n\nSharon and Terry were married for more than 25 years before his passing. Together, they enjoyed traveling extensively throughout the United States, visiting almost every state and making annual trips to Hawaii. They also traveled abroad in Europe and Asia."
