        "text": "Simple Pleasures\n\nI’m very excited to announce the upcoming reissue of my debut solo album Simple Pleasures. Originally released in 1990, it was produced by David Grisman and features Alison Krauss (fiddle), Mike Marshall (guitar, mandolin, fiddle), Matt Eakle (flute) and more. Digging into the tracks and revisiting these tunes was like finding a time capsule! The reissue was lovingly remixed at Compass Soiund Studio and remastered and will be out on limited edition vinyl, CD and DL. We also included the original demo versions, produced by Richard Greene, on the CD and DL versions.\n\nArtistWorks\n\nIf you’re interested in learning to play the banjo or improving your chops, please check out my ArtistWorks on line school. There are over 150 lessons that range beginning through advanced levels with a special focus on tips and techniques for beginning and intermediate level players. I hope to see you on line!
