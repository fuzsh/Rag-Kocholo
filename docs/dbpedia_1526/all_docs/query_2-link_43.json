        "text": "January 29, 2014\n\nGroupings\n\nResidential\n\nSharon Brown is a performer and educator who gravitates towards works of art that make a statement. The art that hangs on the walls of her home, that she shares with her two sons and husband, varies in medium and subject matter. Personally, she is attracted to the spirit of strong females, be it the artist who created the work, or the subject matter of a painting. This feminine spirit is found in prettier elements too, like in paintings of butterflies or a vintage bowl.\n\nOctober 6, 2011\n\nBefore and After\n\nStaff Spaces\n\nI often like to switch around the art I have. A new context brings new life and appreciation to the piece, the room, and ultimately, to my happiness. There’s no better feeling than rediscovering an old favorite , or noticing a detail of a painting you never noticed before – now that it’s in better light. The new grouping here above the yellow chair is of an older piece newly framed, and a newer portrait which I love. I sit on my couch directly across from these women, and I love the colour they bring to my space, as they stare back at me!"
