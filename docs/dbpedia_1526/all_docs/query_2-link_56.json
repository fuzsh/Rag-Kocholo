        "text": "By day, Sharon Saline is a clinical psychologist, award-winning author, consultant and international speaker who specializes in working with ADHD, anxiety and neurodiversity. By night, she’s a cabaret performer who mixes songs from musical theater, jazz standards and rock with personal stories about life’s crazy moments and its more challenging ones. A former professional actress who loves both comedy, musicals and improvisational theater, Sharon has also directed and performed in children’s theater and studied psychodrama. She sang for five years with High Definition, a women’s acapella group in Northampton, before focusing solely on her cabaret shows. Sharon has studied storytelling with Gerald Stropnicky (“First Person Story” workshop at the KO Theater Festival) and is a long-time student of Justina Golden at the Profound Sound Voice studio. She is a graduate of Brown University, B.A. magna cum laude, New College of California, M.A. and the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant University. Sharon is the mother to Jonah and Sarina and the newly minted grandmother of Felix."
