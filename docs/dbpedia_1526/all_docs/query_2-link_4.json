        "text": "Sharon Catherine Brown, a native New Yorker, is a distinguished Broadway performer and advocate for finding families for foster youth. The daughter of two former Broadway stars, June Brown and Johnny Brown (known for his role as Mr. Bookman on TV’s “Good Times”), Sharon’s career shines with exceptional credits. She is set to reprise her role as Mrs. Nolan in the upcoming Broadway production of “Days Of Wine And Roses” in January 2024, reuniting with her “Rent” director, Michael Greif.\n\nSharon has portrayed a diverse range of characters in her illustrious Broadway career, including roles in “Caroline Or Change,” “Head Over Heels,” “Dreamgirls,” “Joseph … Dreamcoat,” and “Maggie Flynn.” Her television and film work, featuring appearances in “The Good Fight,” “A Different World,” “Generations,” “Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,” and “Sister Act II,” adds depth to her artistic journey. Notably, she was the first Black woman to play Lucy in Frank Wildhorn’s “Jekyll & Hyde” and recently took on the role of Madame Millet in the workshop of his new musical, “Song Of Bernadette.” Sharon is also a regular guest performer at the prestigious Cafe Carlyle with Seth Rudetsky.\n\nHowever, Sharon’s most cherished role in life is that of a parent. Sharon adopted her son Elijah and shared her story during Voices: Stars for Foster Kids, a musical benefit for You Gotta Believe in New York City, in 2023."
