        "text": "American politician and educator (born 1952)\n\nSherrod Campbell Brown ( ; born November 9, 1952) is an American politician who is the senior United States senator from Ohio, a seat which he has held since 2007. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the U.S. representative for Ohio's 13th congressional district from 1993 to 2007 and the 47th secretary of state of Ohio from 1983 to 1991. He started his political career in 1975 as a state representative.\n\nBrown defeated two-term Republican incumbent Mike DeWine in the 2006 U.S. Senate election and was reelected in 2012, defeating state treasurer Josh Mandel, and in 2018, defeating U.S. representative Jim Renacci. In the Senate, he was chair of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition and Family Farms and the Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy, and is also a member of the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Select Committee on Ethics. At the start of the 114th Congress in January 2015, Brown became the ranking Democratic member on the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.[2] In February 2021, Brown became chair of the committee.\n\nBrown became the state's senior U.S. senator after the retirement of George Voinovich in 2011. Since 2011, Brown has been the only Democratic statewide elected official in Ohio, with the exception of some Democratic-affiliated Ohio Supreme Court justices elected in nonpartisan races.[3] He is widely considered a liberal, progressive and populist Democrat.[4][5][6]\n\nEarly life, education, and academic career\n\n[edit]\n\nSherrod Brown was born in Mansfield, Ohio, on November 9, 1952, the son of Emily (n√©e Campbell) and Charles Gailey Brown, M.D.[7] He has Scottish, Irish, German, and English ancestry, and was named after his maternal grandfather.[7] Brown's brother Charlie served as Attorney General of West Virginia from 1985 to 1989.[8] Brown became an Eagle Scout in 1967; his badge was presented by John Glenn.[9] In 1970, he graduated from Mansfield Senior High School.[9]\n\nIn 1974, Brown received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian studies from Yale University.[10][11] While at Yale, he lived in Davenport College,[12] and he campaigned for George McGovern during the 1972 presidential election.[13] He went on to receive a Master of Arts degree in education and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Ohio State University at Columbus in 1979 and 1981, respectively.[11] He taught at Ohio State University's Mansfield branch campus from 1979 to 1981.[14]\n\nEarly political career\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his senior year in college, Brown was recruited by a local Democratic leader to run for Ohio's state house.[13] Brown served as a state representative in Ohio from 1974 to 1982. At the time of his election to the Ohio House, he was the youngest person elected to that body.[15] In 1982 Brown ran for Ohio Secretary of State to succeed Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. He won a four-way Democratic primary that included Dennis Kucinich, then defeated Republican Virgil Brown in the general election. In 1986 Brown was reelected, defeating Vincent C. Campanella. As Secretary of State, Brown focused on voter registration outreach.[13] In 1990 he lost reelection in a heated campaign against Republican Bob Taft, the future Governor of Ohio and great-grandson of President William Howard Taft. This is the only time Brown has lost an election.[13]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\n1992 election\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, Brown moved from Mansfield to Lorain, Ohio, and won a heavily contested Democratic primary for the open seat for Ohio's 13th district, in the western and southern suburbs of Cleveland, after eight-term incumbent Don Pease announced his retirement. The Democratic-leaning district gave him an easy win over the little-known Republican Margaret R. Mueller. He was reelected six times.[16]\n\nTenure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Democrats lost their long-held House majority in the 1994 elections, and stayed in the minority for the remainder of Brown's tenure. As ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee, Brown successfully advocated for increased funding to fight tuberculosis.[13]\n\nIn 2005, Brown led the Democratic effort to block the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). For many months, Brown worked as whip on the issue, securing Democratic \"nay\" votes and seeking Republican allies. After several delays, the House of Representatives finally voted on CAFTA after midnight on July 28, 2005, passing it by one vote.[17]\n\nBrown opposed an amendment to Ohio's constitution that banned same-sex marriage.[18] He was also one of the few U.S. Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.[19]\n\nCommittee assignments\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown was the ranking minority member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee. He also served on the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. While serving on the House International Relations Committee, he was also a member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.[20]\n\nU.S. Senate\n\n[edit]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\n2006\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2005 Brown announced he would not run for the United States Senate seat held by two-term Republican incumbent Mike DeWine,[21] but in October he reconsidered his decision.[22] His announcement came shortly after Democrat Paul Hackett stated that he would soon announce his candidacy. On February 13, 2006, Hackett withdrew from the race, all but ensuring that Brown would win the Democratic nomination. In the May 2 primary Brown won 78.05% of the Democratic vote. His opponent, Merrill Samuel Keiser Jr., received 21.95%.[23]\n\nIn April 2006, Brown, along with John Conyers, brought an action against George W. Bush and others, alleging violations of the Constitution in the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.[24] The case, Conyers v. Bush, was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing.[25]\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Brown defeated DeWine, 56% to 44%.[26]\n\n2012\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown ran for reelection in 2012, facing opponent Josh Mandel, who in 2010 had defeated the incumbent state treasurer by 14 points. Mandel raised $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 alone, to Brown's $1.5 million.[27] Early on Brown enjoyed a steady lead in the polls.[28] Mandel won the March Republican primary with 63% of the vote.[29]\n\nThe Washington Post reported that no candidate running for reelection (save Barack Obama) faced more opposition from outside groups in 2012 than Brown did. As of April 2012 over $5.1 million had been spent on television ads opposing him, according to data provided by a Senate Democratic campaign operative. The United States Chamber of Commerce spent $2.7 million. 60 Plus Association, a conservative group that opposes health care reform, spent another $1.4 million. Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee also spent heavily in the race.[30] In May 2012 Brown campaigned with The West Wing actor Martin Sheen.[31]\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Brown held his seat, winning 50.7% of the vote to Mandel's 44.7%. Independent candidate Scott Rupert received 4.6% of the vote.[32]\n\n2018\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2018 Brown was reelected to a third Senate term, defeating Republican U.S. Representative Jim Renacci by 6.8 points.[33]\n\n2024\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown is running for reelection to a fourth Senate term in 2024. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary election and faces Republican nominee Bernie Moreno in the November general election.[34] Brown's reelection is widely considered essential for Democrats to retain the Senate majority in 2024.[35]\n\nIn 2023, The New York Times wrote that Brown's \"electoral successes trace back to carefully tailored campaigns that catered to local issues over dominant national ones like abortion\", and that for red state Democrats like Brown and Jon Tester of Montana, it was an open question whether they could \"maintain their invaluable political personas while‚Äîfor the first time in their lengthy careers in public office‚Äîpersuading their constituents to keep abortion rights front and center when voting next year.\"[36] In July 2024, Brown's campaign reported that it had raised $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2024.[37]\n\nTenure\n\n[edit]\n\nA staunch critic of free trade who has taken progressive stances on financial issues, Brown has said that the Democratic Party should place stronger emphasis on progressive populism.[5]\n\nIn March 2018, Brown was appointed co-chair of the newly formed Joint Multiemployer Pension Solvency Committee.[38]\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the day the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Brown proposed a bill that would let workers immediately receive paid sick days, allowing them to stay home and self-quarantine if feeling sick or in the event of any public health emergency.[39] He noted it could slow infection spread to coworkers[40] and criticized Republicans for blocking the proposal, although he said he believed the House would pass similar legislation.[41]\n\nAfter President Donald Trump was impeached for the first time in December 2019, Brown voted to remove him from office.[42] During the January 2020 impeachment trial, Brown said he was fine with Republicans bringing witnesses to testify so long as they allowed testimony from witnesses such as John Bolton.[43]\n\nIn January 2020, Brown called on his Senate colleagues to approve legislation that would improve the EPA's regulation of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.[43]\n\nIn February 2020, Brown and other Democrats in the House voted to block two pieces of anti-abortion legislation: the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.[44] The same month, Brown introduced the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act to the Senate.[45]\n\nIn 2021, Brown pushed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to establish the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence in Ohio.[46]\n\nOn July 19, 2024, Brown called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.[47]\n\nCommittee assignments (118th Congress)\n\n[edit]\n\n[48]\n\nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n\nSubcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research\n\nSubcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security\n\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (chair)\n\nAs chair of the committee, Brown serves as an ex officio member on all the subcommittees.\n\nCommittee on Finance\n\nSubcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness\n\nSubcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy (chair)\n\nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs\n\nPotential national campaigns\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Bernie Sanders's closest allies in the U.S. Senate, Brown nevertheless endorsed Hillary Clinton and campaigned for her in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in Ohio.[49] He was vetted as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Clinton. The choice came down to Brown and Tim Kaine, who was ultimately selected.[50] Brown had the distinct disadvantage that had Clinton won, Ohio's Republican Governor John Kasich would have chosen Brown's replacement in the Senate, whereas Kaine's replacement would be chosen by Democrat and Clinton ally Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe.[51]\n\nIn May 2017 Washington Monthly suggested that Brown could unite the establishment and progressive wings of the Democratic Party as a presidential candidate in 2020.[4] On November 12, 2018, Cleveland.com reported that Brown was \"seriously\" considering a presidential run.[52] After winning his third Senate term in the 2018 election, Brown was considered a potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and began exploring a run in January 2019.[53] In March 2019, he announced that he would not run for president and would instead remain a senator.[54] During the 2016 campaign season, Brown also said he had no interest in being vice president.[55]\n\nPolitical positions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2011 National Journal's annual rankings, Brown tied with eight other members for the title of the most liberal member of Congress.[56] According to FiveThirtyEight, Brown voted with President Donald Trump's position on Congressional issues 25.8% of the time.[57] According to FiveThirtyEight, during the 117th Congress, Brown voted with President Joe Biden's stated position 98% of the time.[58]\n\nIn a 2017 issue of Dissent, Michael Kazin introduced an interview with Brown by praising him as \"a politician ahead of his time\" and \"perhaps the most class-conscious Democrat in Washington.\" Brown told Kazin that many Ohioans think \"people on the coasts look down on them\" and blamed this notion on Fox News and The Wall Street Journal.[59]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Brown introduced the Charter School Accountability Act of 2015. The bill did not make it out of committee.[60][61]\n\nBrown praised West Virginia teachers who held a nine-day strike in early 2018.[62]\n\nEnergy and environment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, Brown co-sponsored the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act,[63] a bill prohibiting the export of some electronics for environmental reasons.[64]\n\nIn the wake of the Flint water crisis, Brown announced plans to introduce legislation to force the federal government to step in when cities and states fail to warn residents about lead-contaminated drinking water. He called for the federal government to give Ohio's school districts money to test for lead in drinking water.[65][66]\n\nHealth care\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, voting for it in December 2009,[67] and he voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[68]\n\nIn 2006, Brown co-sponsored the single-payer Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act.[69] He did not co-sponsor Senator Bernie Sanders's single-payer health plan, despite saying he has \"always been supportive\" of such a system. Brown said he was supporting his own plan, which would allow people 55 and older to buy into Medicare.[70][71]\n\nIn January 2019, Brown was one of six Democratic senators to introduce the American Miners Act of 2019, a bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to swap funds in excess of the amount needed to meet existing obligations under the Abandoned Mine Land fund to the 1974 Pension Plan as part of an effort to prevent its insolvency as a result of coal company bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It also increased the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund tax and ensured that miners affected by the 2018 coal company bankruptcies would not lose their health insurance.[72]\n\nLGBT rights\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown voted against prohibiting same-sex couples from adopting children in Washington D.C. He received a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign in 2005‚Äì2006, indicating a pro-gay rights stance.[73][74] On December 18, 2010, he voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.[75][76]\n\nIn October 2018, Brown was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[77]\n\nVeterans\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Brown introduced the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2014 (S. 2323; 113th Congress), a bill that would expand preferred eligibility for federal jobs to the fathers of certain permanently disabled or deceased veterans.[78][79]\n\nIn 2015, Brown and Representative Tim Ryan introduced legislation that would give military veterans priority in scheduling classes in colleges, universities, and other post-secondary education programs.[80]\n\nBanking and finance industry\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, after the leak of the Panama Papers, Brown and Elizabeth Warren urged the Treasury Department to investigate whether U.S. citizens were involved in possible tax avoidance and misconduct associated with the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.[81]\n\nIn 2021, Brown became the chair of the Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy, after having been its ranking Democratic member since 2015. In April of that year, he initiated an inquiry into \"the implosion of Archegos Capital\", an investment firm that lost billions of dollars amid accusations of fraud and insider trading.[82]\n\nCampaign finance\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown has sponsored legislation to require corporate political action committees to disclose their donors.[83]\n\nIn 2019, when Brown was considering running for president, he pledged not to take donations from corporate PACs.[84] He had accepted more than $10.4 million in PAC money from 1997 to 2018.[85] Since Brown declined to seek the presidency in 2019, his Senate campaign committee and leadership PAC have accepted over $1 million in corporate PAC donations.[86] Some of the corporate PAC money that Brown accepted came from health insurance and pharmaceutical companies that the state of Ohio is suing for allegedly illegally driving up drug prices.[87]\n\nTaxation and stimulus spending\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown's opposition to the 2017 tax bill led to what was described as a \"shouting match\" with Senator Orrin Hatch, who accused Brown of \"spouting off\" to the effect that the tax bill benefited the rich.[88]\n\nIn March 2018, Vice President Mike Pence criticized Brown for his recent vote against the Republican tax bill (the TCJA).[88] Brown had argued the bill overwhelmingly benefited wealthy individuals and corporations, with a much smaller impact on the middle class.[89]\n\nIn 2009, Brown voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.[90]\n\nTrade\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown has criticized free trade with China and other countries. In a 2006 Washington Post article, he argued against free trade on the grounds that labor activism was responsible for the growth of the U.S. middle class, and that the U.S. economy is harmed by trade relations with countries that lack the kind of labor regulations that have resulted from that activism.[91]\n\nIn 2011, the Columbus Dispatch noted that Brown \"loves to rail against international trade agreements.\"[92] Brown's book Myths of Free Trade argues that \"an unregulated global economy is a threat to all of us.\"[93] In the book he recommends measures that would allow for emergency tariffs, protect Buy America laws, including those that give preference to minority and women-owned businesses, and hold foreign producers to American labor and environmental standards.[94] Brown co-authored and sponsored a bill that would officially declare China a currency manipulator and require the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties on Chinese imports.[95][96]\n\nIn May 2016, Brown called for tariffs to be imposed on imports from China and praised Hillary Clinton's plan to enforce rules and trade laws and triple the enforcement budgets at the United States Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission.[97]\n\nBrown opposes NAFTA, which he argues should be renegotiated to aid Ohio workers.[98][74]\n\nIn January 2018, Brown supported President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on washing machine imports.[99] He supported his first trade agreement in 2019, after never having previously supported one while in Congress. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement because he said it would send Ohioan jobs to Mexico, but supported a new trade agreement for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada after a \"step toward a pro-worker trade policy, but it's not a perfect agreement.\"[100]\n\nIn November 2023, pressure from Brown and other congressional Democrats led the Biden administration to abandon plans for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's trade component.[101][102]\n\nForeign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown opposed the Iraq War and voted against the Iraq Resolution as a House Representative.[103] He voted against the $87 billion war budgetary supplement and for redeploying U.S. troops out of Iraq by March 2008.[104] Brown voted for the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, which appropriated $250 billion for ongoing military operations and domestic programs.[105]\n\nIn December 2010, Brown voted for the ratification of New START,[106] a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years, and providing for a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.[107]\n\nIn 2015, Brown co-sponsored an amendment to the budget that was unanimously approved by the Senate and that would reimpose sanctions on Iran if Iran violated the terms of the interim or final agreement by advancing its nuclear program.[108]\n\nBrown co-sponsored reaffirmations of the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances in regards to United States-Taiwan relations.[109][110][111][112] Weeks after the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement broke out, demanding genuine universal suffrage among other goals, Brown (the chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China), co-chair Chris Smith, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin, Marco Rubio, Roger Wicker, Dianne Feinstein, and Jeff Merkley, and U.S. Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Dan Lipinski, and Frank Wolf introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would update the United States‚ÄìHong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and U.S. commitment to democratic development in Hong Kong.[113][114][115][116]\n\nIn September 2016, in advance of UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Brown signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging President Obama to veto \"one-sided\" resolutions against Israel.[117] In February 2019, Brown voted against a controversial Israel Anti-Boycott Act initiated by Republicans[118] that would allow states to prohibit government agencies from contracting with organizations involved in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.[119]\n\nIn June 2017, Brown criticized U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen, saying, \"It's becoming increasingly clear that Saudi Arabia has been deliberately targeting civilian targets. And that's absolutely unacceptable\".[120] In July 2017, he voted for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which placed sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[121] In May 2018, Brown, Bob Menendez, and Mark Warner wrote to the inspectors general of the State Department, Treasury Department, and intelligence community to allege that the Trump administration had failed to fully comply with the provisions of the CAATSA and request investigation into that.[122] In October 2018, Brown condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[123]\n\nIn May 2018, Brown was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that \"Iran could either remain in the agreement and seek to isolate the United States from our closest partners, or resume its nuclear activities\" if the U.S. pulled out and that both possibilities \"would be detrimental to our national security interests.\"[124] In August 2018, Brown and 16 other members of Congress urged the U.S. to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[125]\n\nIn January 2019, after Juan Guaid√≥ was declared interim President of Venezuela by the National Assembly, Brown said the U.S. should \"work with our allies and use economic, political and diplomatic leverage to help bring about free and fair elections, limit escalating tension, and ensure the safety of Americans on the ground\", and called the Trump administration's suggestions of military intervention \"reckless and irresponsible\".[126]\n\nIn March 2024, Brown urged the Biden administration to recognize a \"nonmilitarized\" Palestinian state after the end of the war in Gaza.[127]\n\nGun policy\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown has criticized the political influence of gun manufacturers.[128]\n\nBrown called the Republican legislature in Ohio \"lunatics\" for introducing a concealed carry bill that would allow people to carry guns into airplane terminals (before security), police buildings, private airplanes, and day care facilities.[129]\n\nIn the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, Brown participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster.[130] A few weeks later, he voted for the Feinstein Amendment, which would have barred anyone on the terrorist watch list from buying a gun.[131]\n\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Brown supported Dianne Feinstein's effort to ban bump stocks.[132]\n\nRailroad safety\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2019, Brown was one of ten senators to cosponsor the Safe Freight Act, a bill requiring freight trains to have one or more certified conductors and a certified engineer aboard who can collaborate on protecting the train and people living near the tracks. The legislation was meant to correct a Federal Railroad Administration rollback of a proposed rule intended to establish safety standards.[133]\n\nTerrorism\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown was one of 67 members of Congress who voted against the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act.[134][135]\n\nIn December 2015, Brown co-sponsored a bill in Congress that would restrict ISIS's financing by authorizing new sanctions on foreign financial institutions that knowingly facilitate financial transactions with ISIS. The bill called for tightening international passport regulations and additional screening of persons attempting to enter the U.S. on certain types of visas. The bill also provided grants to local law enforcement agencies to train for active shooter situations and terrorist attacks and to conduct cyber-training to identify and track extremists such as the couple behind the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Brown also called for banning those on the no fly list from purchasing assault weapons.[136][137][138]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown was married to Larke Recchie from 1979 to 1987, and they had two children. During their divorce proceedings, Recchie obtained a restraining order against Brown to keep him from harassing or annoying her and from \"doing bodily harm\". In a supporting affidavit, she said she was \"in fear for the safety and well-being of myself and our children due to [Brown's] physical violence and abusive nature\" and that Brown had \"intimidated, pushed, shoved and bullied\" her on several occasions.[139] Years later, Recchie walked back her claims of physical violence against Brown.[140]\n\nRecchie and Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist Connie Schultz later became friends and filmed an ad together for Brown's 2006 Senate campaign. Recchie hosted a fund-raising event for Brown's 2012 reelection campaign against Republican Josh Mandel and issued a statement saying, \"I understand that in campaigns you often have to go after your opponent, but Josh Mandel should know better than to go after our family. I ask that he immediately put a stop to this kind of politics. I was proud to support Sherrod in 2006 and I'm proud to support him again this time around against Josh Mandel. Josh Mandel should immediately stop this kind of dirty campaigning.\"[139]\n\nIn 2004, Brown married Schultz. She resigned from her job in 2011, because being a politician's spouse presented a conflict of interest.[141] She won a Pulitzer Prize in 2005.[142] She is also the author of Life Happens (2007) and ...and His Lovely Wife (2008), in which she describes her experiences as the spouse of a U.S. Senate candidate.[143] He has two stepchildren from this marriage.[144]\n\nBrown's daughter Elizabeth was president pro tempore of the Columbus City Council and served on the council for seven years.[145] He has five grandchildren.[146] He is Lutheran.[147]\n\nBrown's brother, Charlie, is a former West Virginia attorney general.[148]\n\nOn May 5, 2007, Brown was awarded an honorary doctorate from Capital University.[149] On May 18, 2014, Brown was awarded an honorary doctor of public service degree from Otterbein University. Along with his wife, Brown delivered a keynote address at the undergraduate commencement.[150]\n\nIn June 2023, NBC News reported that Brown had been late paying his Cleveland property tax bill seven times, most recently in February, and that for years he claimed owner-occupant tax credits on properties in two different Ohio counties.[151] Brown subsequently paid the delinquent tax bill and repaid Franklin County for the tax credit. His campaign said he would not claim it in future years.[151] In August 2023, Brown corrected several years of Senate financial disclosure forms that had previously omitted his wife's pension money.[152]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown is the author of three books:\n\nCongress from the Inside: Observations from the Majority and the Minority, Kent State University Press, 2004, ISBN 978-0873387927\n\nMyths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed, The New Press, 2006, ISBN 978-1595581242\n\nDesk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who Changed America, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2019, ISBN 978-0374138219\n\nElectoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nDemocratic primary results, Ohio's 13th congressional district election, 2004[153] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 69,455 100.00\n\nOhio's 13th congressional district election, 2004[154] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 298,094 100 Democratic hold\n\nDemocratic primary results, Ohio 2006 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 747,404 100.00\n\n2006 United States Senate election in Ohio Party Candidate Votes % Majority 452,690 12.34% Turnout 4,019,236 53.25% Democratic gain from Republican Swing -17.9\n\nDemocratic primary results, Ohio 2012 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 802,678 100.00\n\n2012 United States Senate election in Ohio[155] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 5,449,128 100.0% N/A Democratic hold\n\nDemocratic primary results, Ohio 2018[156] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 613,373 100%\n\n2018 United States Senate election in Ohio[157] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 4,410,898 100.0% N/A Democratic hold\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOhio United States Senate elections\n\nList of United States senators from Ohio\n\n2024 United States Senate election in Ohio\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSherrod Brown Archived November 16, 2017, at the Wayback Machine official U.S. Senate website\n\nSherrod Brown for Senate Archived October 31, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\n\nSherrod Brown at Curlie"
