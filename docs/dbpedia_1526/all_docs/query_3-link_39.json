        "text": "Sharon Brown, partner, has been appointed Barclay Damon’s diversity partner and chair of the Diversity Partner Committee, effective immediately.\n\nAs diversity partner and chair of the Diversity Partner Committee, Brown leads Barclay Damon’s award-winning Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) program and oversees all diversity initiatives and groups, including the Diversity Partner Committee; Diversity Leadership Teams resident in each office; and employee affinity networks, which are the firm’s Women’s Forum, Black Employee Affinity Network, and LGBTQIA+ Employee Affinity Network.\n\nConnie Cahill, Barclay Damon’s managing partner, said, “We are thrilled to have Sharon assume this critical role. As a firm that holds DEI foundational to everything we do, Sharon will be an ideal steward due to her dedication to both DEI and Barclay Damon. After excelling in co-leading our summer associate program, which includes dedicated key placements for historically underrepresented groups in the legal profession, we know she will bring the same passion and success to her new role.”\n\nBrown follows Sheila Gaddis, of counsel, as diversity partner and chair of the Diversity Partner Committee. Gaddis was appointed to the then-newly established position in 2009. Gaddis will continue with Barclay Damon in her of counsel role.\n\nBrown said, “The legacy Sheila leaves is large, and her shoes will be difficult to fill, but working hard to always do better is part of this firm’s DNA. With all of us striving together, I look forward to continuing to infuse DEI principles in all of our strategic planning, operations, and outreach.”\n\nIn an internal statement, Cahill credited Gaddis with authoring innovative DEI policies and advising firm leadership on effectively recruiting and using the talent, energy, and creativity of the firm’s diverse workforce for maximum organizational effectiveness and the best use of intellectual capital. Under Gaddis’s leadership, Barclay Damon launched its DEI publication Voices of Excellence; created its Women’s Forum, Black Employees Affinity Network, and LGBTQIA+ Employee Affinity Network; developed the celebrated 1L Summer Associate Program; and more. Gaddis also oversaw the firm’s award-winning pro bono program. Most recently, Gaddis led the creation of a new cultural competency initiative.\n\nCahill noted, “Sheila has left an indelible mark on the firm for which there is no way to repay her.” In tribute, the firm has created the Sheila Gaddis Scholarship, which will be given annually to a diverse law student to fund the cost of a bar review class.\n\nTo learn more about DEI at Barclay Damon, go to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion | Barclay Damon."
