        "text": "Sharon Lee (Parizek) Brown\n\nJune 11, 1934 – March 7, 2022\n\nTacoma, WA – God called Sharon Brown home on March 7 after blessing her with 87 well-lived years of life on earth. Whether you called her wife, mom, grandma, aunt, friend, or neighbor, you couldn’t help but love Sharon. With a sparkling smile and a dancing spirit, she chose to be happy every day and in doing so brought joy and happiness to her family, friends, and community. She truly was blessed to be a blessing – and she did it beautifully.\n\nBorn to Mary and Charles Parizek and raised in Tacoma, she was a graduate of Stadium High School. She married her high school sweetheart, T. Warren Brown, in 1956 and celebrated 48 years of marriage before Warren passed away.\n\nWith four daughters and nine grandchildren, Sharon was well loved. But, more importantly, she loved well. She fiercely loved God, her family, her friends, and her community and left a huge impact on all of them. Her quick wit and candor couldn’t help, but make you laugh. Her beautiful eyes twinkled with mischief and joy. Her effervescent personality drew you in and made you want to stay and talk. And she loved to talk. There wasn’t a topic that she wasn’t a self-proclaimed expert, except math. She didn’t like math.\n\nSharon always said she was twice blessed when it came to loving husbands. Both widowed, Sharon married Jack R. Hamilton in 2006. She was lovingly welcomed into Jack’s family and readily accepted the role of great grandma.\n\nThroughout her life, Sharon strongly supported the Tacoma community. As vice president of Ted Brown Music, Sharon helped promote music education across the state of Washington. She served on the Mary Bridge Brigade as both a member and leader, Festival of Trees, and many other charities. A life-long member of Immanuel Presbyterian Church, she served as Deacon and Elder. She was also a member of the Tacoma Lawn & Tennis Club where she enjoyed playing tennis and “coffee with the girls” for many years. She also loved playing bridge with her monthly bridge group.\n\nIn addition to her parents and Warren, Sharon was predeceased by her second-husband Jack Hamilton, grandson Jeffrey Eidson, and son-in-law Rodney Eidson. She is survived by her daughters and sons-in-law Lezlie & Scott Peck, Stephanie & Bob Howe, Whitney & David Grisaffi, Karlee (Karen) & Jim Moore, and eight grandchildren: Sara (Patrick) Peck, Tyler Peck, Matthew Peck, Addison Grisaffi, Garrison (Allyssa) Grisaffi, Caron Grisaffi, Alexandra (Moore) (Ryan) Dietrich, and Victoria Moore; and brother, Doug (Maressa) Parizek).\n\nA celebration of life will be held on April 12 at Immanuel Presbyterian Church at 3:00 pm with a reception following at the Slavonian Hall. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Ted Brown Music Outreach (www.tbmoutreach.org)."
