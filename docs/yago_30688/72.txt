The only daughter of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark, and Princess Marie of Orleans, as per an arrangement at the time of her parents marriage, she was raised Catholic while her brothers were Protestant.

The couple had four children, including Queen Anne of Romania and Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, and resided in quite reduced circumstances in France until the Second World War, when they lived in exile in the United States, where Prince René worked at a gas company, Princess Margaret made hats and Princess Anne worked at Macy’s. The family returned to Paris after the war and the couple continued to be active at royal events including the Wedding of Crown Prince Leopold of Belgium and Princess Astrid of Sweden, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Princess Ingrid of Sweden’s Wedding in 1935, King Christian X’s Silver Jubilee in 1937, and King Frederik IX’s 70th Birthday in 1969.
