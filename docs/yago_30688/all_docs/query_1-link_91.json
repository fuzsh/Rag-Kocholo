        "text": "Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II, married Antony Armstrong-Jones, later Lord Snowdon, on May 6, 1960. The marriage between a Princess and a glamorous photographer generated a lot of interest among the public. The couple had two children, David, now 2nd Lord Snowdon, and Lady Sarah Chatto, but was eventually unsuccessful. They divorced in 1978. Take a look at scenes from their wedding below-\n\nEmbed from Getty Images Embed from Getty Images\n\nPrincess Margaret rode in the Glass Coach to Westminster Abbey with the Duke of Edinburgh, who also walked her up the aisle and gave her away, since her father had died in 1952.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Queen (wearing a turquoise Norman Hartnell gown with her Two strand pearl necklace, and the True Lover’s Knot Brooch) arrived with the Queen Mother(wearing a turquoise Norman Hartnell gown with her Greville Peardrop Earrings and Queen Alexandra’s Wedding Parure Necklace) and Prince Charles. Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe ceremony was officiated by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, who also officiated at the Queen’s Wedding in 1947, and crowned the Queen in 1952.\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMost foreign Royal Families disapproved of a Princess marrying a photographer, and Queen Ingrid of Denmark was the only foreign queen to attend the wedding. This is at a contrast to the wedding of her cousin, Princess Alexandra, in 1964.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHere members of the bride’s family walk down the aisle, including Princess Alexandra of Kent, Prince Michael of Kent, Princess Alice Countess of Athlone, Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood, the Duke of Kent, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, Prince William of Gloucester, Prince Richard of Gloucester, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe cameras also got to see the Princess and her bridegroom arriving in Buckingham Palace, followed by their families.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAfterwards, the entire royal family went out on the famous Buckingham Palace Balcony. This was before kissing on the balcony was traditional, so instead, the couple just waved to the crowds. The group also posed for Official Pictures, taken by Cecil Beaton, including a rather famous picture of the Queen.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nPrincess Margaret wore a bespoke Norman Hartnell couture creation with a white silk organza with a satin-bound silk tulle veil and the Poltimore Tiara, which was bought by her just before the wedding, and continued to be a favourite throughout her life. It was sold by her children in 2006.\n\nLater, Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones sailed away on the Royal Yacht Britannia, for a seven week-long honeymoon in the Caribbean."
