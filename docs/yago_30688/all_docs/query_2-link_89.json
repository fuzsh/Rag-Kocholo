        "text": "Prince Henrik, the French-born husband to Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, died on Tuesday. The prince was diagnosed with dementia last September and had been hospitalized since January 28 for a lung infection, according to The Guardian. A private funeral will be held next Tuesday, but Danes will be mourning all month, while flags are at half-mast.\n\nQueen Margrethe and Prince Henrik were married in 1967 after meeting in London and secretly dating for a year. Henrik will be cremated, per his wishes, and half his ashes will be spread in Danish waters and the other half will be buried at Fredensborg Castle, north of Copenhagen. He famously refused to be buried next to his wife because he was never made a king.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, he found having to play the supporting role in his marriage difficult. When his wife became queen in 1972, he vocalized to the media that he was angry he wasn't made a king to match her title.\n\nPrincess Margrethe, later Queen Margrethe II, weds Prince Henrik in Copenhagen. Prince Henrik was formerly French diplomat Count Henri de Monpezat.\n\n“My wife has decided that she would like to be Queen, and I’m very pleased with that,” he said. “But as a person, she must know that if a man and a woman are married, then they are equal. My wife hasn’t shown me the respect an ordinary wife should show her spouse.” (There is protocol behind Henrik's snug, though: a ruling Queen's husband doesn't necessarily earn a king title just by being married to royalty. For example, Queen Elizabeth's husband Philip was never made a king, even though he also wanted to be one.)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Queen Margrethe of Denmark, with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Henrik pose before the state banquet at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle on February 16, 2000 in Windsor, England.\n\nHenrik didn't start performing royal duties on his own until 1997, 25 years after his wife became queen. At one point, he said he thought people assumed he was a loser until he proved them wrong. “People are just used to considering Prince Henrik as … a little dog that follows behind and gets a sugar cube once in a while,” he said. In 2002, he fled Denmark for his French chateau because he need to \"reflect on life.\" He stayed there for three weeks, before Margrethe went to visit him to mend fences, and the couple returned to Denmark together.\n\nHe retired from public life in 2016, announcing then that he didn't want to be buried next to his wife in Roskilde Cathedral, which is where Danish royal couples are usually buried. “She’s the one playing me for a fool,\" he said. \"I didn’t marry The Queen to get buried at Roskilde.”\n\nOn July 19, 1975, Queen Margrethe II, Prince Joachim, Prince Henrik, and Prince Frederik pose in the garden of their castle in Southern France, the region from which the consort Prince originates.\n\nHenrik is survived by his wife, Queen Margrethe II, and his two sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim. The palace released a statement that all three family members were by his side when he passed."
