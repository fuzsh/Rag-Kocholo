        "text": "If youâve ever dreamed of living like royalty, nowâs your chance. As TopTenRealEstateDeals.com reports, a seaside French fortress owned by a Danish Princess is heading to auction on May 16.\n\nThe daughter of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, Princess Margaret had royal connections extending throughout Europe. Her cousins included monarchs in Russia and Greece as well as Englandâs own Queen Elizabeth. She lived with her husband, Prince RenÃ© of Bourbon-Parma, in a manor house overlooking the French Riviera until they were force to flee France during the Nazi invasion of World War II.\n\nThe estate, known as La Carriere, still stands today in CÃ´te d'Azur, and itâs in need of a new owner. Built into a fortressâs stone walls, the century-old structure mixes MediterraneanÂ flair with stately history. Inside residents will find a rustic living room with high-beamed ceilings and an expansive fireplace. The five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and ample dining area make it the perfect place for hosting guests.Â\n\nThe property also takes advantage of the beautiful natural surroundings. Terraces provide panoramic views of the famous French Riviera, which attracts ships and yachts from around the world. If La Carriereâs new owners donât feel like going to the beach, they can spend the day lounging in their rooftop Jacuzzi or by the pool in their stone grotto.Â\n\nThirty years after Princess Margaret of Denmarkâs death, her former home is going on sale through Concierge Auctions later this month. The auction is no-reserve, meaning that even if the highest bid is lower than desired, the sale will still go through. With a former listing price of $12 million, the property is expected to fetch bids worthy of its royal history."
