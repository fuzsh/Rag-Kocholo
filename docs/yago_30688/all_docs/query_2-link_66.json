        "text": "It appears as though Queen Margrethe of Denmark’s abdication news came as a surprise not only to the world but to her sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, too.\n\nAccording to Danish newspaper Berlingske, Frederik and Joachim found out about his mother’s plans to abdicate the throne on Dec. 28 — just three days before her official announcement.\n\nThe monarch — third cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II — revealed in her New Year’s speech on Dec. 31 that she would be stepping down on Jan. 14.\n\nThe decision to abdicate her throne means that her son, Crown Prince Frederik, will now take the reins.\n\nPrince Joachim, who lives in Washington, DC, with his family after announcing plans to move across the pond in March 2023, is expected to return to Denmark for his brother’s accession.\n\nJoachim and his family made the transatlantic move after Queen Margrethe stripped his four children of their prince and princess titles.\n\nIn early 2023, the children became known as His/Her Excellency Count of Monpezat instead of His/Her Highness.\n\nOn Sunday, Margrethe is expected to sign a declaration of abdication at Copenhagen’s Christiansborg Palace during a Council of State meeting.\n\nAfter she signs, her son will become King Frederik X, and her daughter-in-law will be Queen Mary.\n\nThe new rulers will hold a reception at the palace to mark the occasion, however, there will be no official coronation ceremony as there was for King Charles in May 2023.\n\nMargrethe made her final public appearance as monarch last week as she was escorted by members of the Hussar Regiment through the streets of Denmark’s capital city of Copenhagen.\n\nThe 83-year-old sovereign traveled in a luxurious carriage from Amalienborg Palace to Christiansborg Palace for a plush New Year’s reception.\n\nThe smiling queen waved to royalists lining the snowy streets of the Danish capital hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal on her final hurrah as monarch.\n\nIt’s since been suggested that Britain’s King Charles may be looking to make a similar move himself and step down as King in favor of his son Prince William and his wife, Princess Catherine, to take the throne while they’re still young.\n\nQueen Margrethe’s decision to abdicate early could be to ensure that the monarchy kept up with the times — something Charles has expressed interest in implementing into his own Firm.\n\nHowever, at this time there’s been no indication that this is something the British ruler is considering."
