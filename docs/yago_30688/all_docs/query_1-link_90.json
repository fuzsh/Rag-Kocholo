        "text": "The surprise abdication of Denmark’s Queen may be a calculated strategy to save the marriage of her son and heir following rumours that he had an affair with a Mexican actress, royal experts said on Monday.\n\nQueen Margrethe II became the first Danish monarch to step down in 500 years when she announced her abdication live on television in a traditional New Year’s Eve address.\n\nShe will be succeeded by her son, Crown Prince Frederik, 55, who is married to Crown Princess Mary, 51, an Australian whom he met in a Sydney bar during the 2000 Olympics.\n\nAffair rumours\n\nThe crown prince, who had a reputation as a playboy in his youth, has been dogged by recent rumours that he had an affair with a Mexican socialite.\n\nHe was photographed by Lecturas, a Spanish magazine, strolling around Madrid with Genoveva Casanova in November, visiting a Picasso exhibition and reportedly sharing an intimate dinner.\n\nThe magazine published photographs that it said showed the Crown Prince leaving Ms Casanova’s apartment the morning after the alleged dinner date.\n\nMs Casanova, 47, who has appeared in reality TV shows, has denied having any romantic relationship with Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nThe Danish royals have not commented on the reports.\n\nPrincess Mary travelled back to Australia to visit her family for Christmas without her husband.\n\nThe unexpected abdication of the queen could be a deliberate tactic to propel her son into the role of king and to put his marriage to Crown Princess Mary on a new footing, royal experts said.\n\n“It’s possible that the Queen took this action because she would have been terrified of the marriage breaking up and the royal family losing Mary. It would have caused major problems. The Queen has always seen Mary as a tremendous asset,” said Phil Dampier, an author and commentator who has reported on the Danish royal family for more than 20 years.\n\n“It just seems an extraordinary coincidence that she should make this unexpected announcement just a couple of months after stories emerged of the Crown Prince supposedly having an affair. In two weeks’ time, the Prince and Princess will be pitched together as King and Queen and they will have to get on with it. The Queen may be thinking that they will patch up their differences and it will save their marriage.”\n\nAbdication entirely unexpected\n\nThe abdication of Queen Margrethe, who was Europe’s longest-serving monarch after coming to the throne on the death of her father King Frederick IX in 1972, was entirely unexpected.\n\nIn the past she had indicated that, like Elizabeth II, she regarded the role as a job for life.\n\nAs recently as 2016, she had rejected the possibility of abdication. “It’s always been: you stay as long as you live. That’s what my father did and my predecessors. And the way I see it too,” she said.\n\nMany Danes had expected her to remain monarch until her death. “It came completely out of the blue. I think a lot of Danes are quite shocked by it,” said Mr Dampier.\n\n“The Queen seemed to be in reasonable health. She suffered from back pain but had recently had an operation so you would think that would enable her to carry on in the role.\n\n“It seems strange that it happened so soon after the rumours of an affair. The prince was known as a playboy in his youth - maybe she worried that he was going back to his old ways.”\n\nMost Danes support monarchy\n\nLars Hovbakke Sorensen, a historian and an expert on the Danish royals, said Crown Princess Mary, who is originally from Tasmania and was working as a marketing executive when she met the Crown Prince in a bar in Sydney, is hugely popular. “Opinion polls show that she is as popular as Queen Margrethe. Overall, surveys show that about 80 per cent of Danes support the monarchy.”\n\nHe thinks the abdication was motivated more by the Queen’s concern that her son should not languish as Crown Prince for too long.\n\nShe wants him to avoid the fate of King Charles, who only acceded to the throne at the age of 73 after Queen Elizabeth died in September 2022 at the age of 96.\n\n“People in Europe are living for longer and there was the risk that you might have an old Crown Prince eventually acceding to the throne. Abdication was a way of avoiding the Prince Charles situation,” said Prof Sorenson, an associate professor at University College Absalon in Denmark.\n\nReady to replace father as Crown Prince\n\nThe Queen may also have been motivated by the recent coming of age of her grandson, Prince Christian, who turned 18 in October. “She may think that he is now ready to replace his father as Crown Prince,” said Prof Sorenson.\n\nThe abdication announcement was highly unusual. “It was very surprising for everyone because we have a long, long tradition in Denmark of kings and queens staying in office until they die. The last abdication was in 1523.”\n\nThe world’s only reigning queen, who is 83 years old, will step down on January 14 – exactly 52 years after she became monarch.\n\nShe said her decision was prompted by her age and health issues – she has suffered from back problems for many years and underwent surgery in early 2023."
