        "text": "King Frederik of Denmark and his wife Queen Mary made their first joint appearance together in weeks as they stepped out for Queen Margrethe’s birthday.\n\nThe couple joined King Frederik’s mother, the former monarch of Denmark, at the Fredensborg Castle ahead of festivities of Queen Margrethe’s big day. Queen Mary was elegant in a baby blue coat for the outing, which she paired with a simple navy blouse and black trousers. The royal mother-of-four swept her hair into a high ponytail, revealing a pair of simple drop earrings. Meanwhile her husband King Frederik coordinated in a vibrant blue tie.\n\nIt was perhaps a sign of unity between the couple, who have faced months of speculation and wild rumour about the state of their marriage. At the end of last year, tabloid speculation emerged surrounding a possible affair between Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova and King Frederik. Casanova, a model, charity activist and former reality TV star, was pictured on a late night out in Madrid at the end of last year, thrusting the rumour mill into overdrive. The images were explained at the time by HOLA! in the following terms: Frederik and a mutual friend of his and Genoveva’s had plans to attend an exhibition together. After the friend pulled out, Genoveva was asked to go in his place. The pair then walked through the park and had a public dinner together at ‘El Corral de la Morería’.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Queen Mary of Denmark? Meet the bona fide Danish national asset whose recent solo appearances have hit headlines\n\n‘Mary Queen of Scots’ – as she’s been dubbed owing to her Scottish ancestry – is known for being elegant, regal and impececcably well dressed\n\nAfter the debacle surrounding the pictures, which were published in Spanish magazine Lecturas, Casanova disappeared from social media. Weeks later, Frederik’s mother Queen Margrethe II shockingly abdicated and he ascended the Danish throne amid scenes of jubilation in Copenhagen. Yet the rumours showed no sign of slowing down. In March, it emerged that King Frederik actually returned to Spain for a private trip earlier this year. It is not clear exactly when Frederik travelled to Spain but it was suggested in HOLA! that the King was last in Madrid in February, perhaps making his first visit since the coronation.\n\nRead More\n\nA cool holiday? King Frederik and Queen Mary appear ‘icy’ in new photographs of skiing trip - months after the notorious photos of his Madrid night out\n\nThe Danish royals have faced months of speculation and rumour about the state of their marriage\n\nThe King and Queen continued to make a series of public appearances side-by-side, while Casanova returned to social media to thank her fans for their ongoing support.\n\nThe couple then faced rumour that Queen Mary hadn’t joined the rest of her family for the annual break over Easter weekend. The family often travel for the festive weekend, with the palace telling Her&Nul weeks ago that Queen Margrethe would be acting as head of state as the whole family travelled out of the country. However, the flag over their mansion in Amalienborg Castle remained raised throughout the Easter weekend - meaning that at least Frederik, Mary or their son Crown Prince Christian were staying in residence.\n\nRead More\n\nA dutiful King: Frederik of Denmark receives ambassadors to the palace in his first public appearance in weeks - after Queen Mary attended a number of engagements alone\n\nKing Frederik of Denmark stepped out solo at the Royal Palace this week, after his wife Queen Mary made a number of appearances alone\n\nWhile images did emerge of King Frederik and Queen Mary on the trip to Verbier, the pictures did little to quell the rumours. Photographs of the couple appeared to show the pair looking rather serious as they holidayed with their children in March. In photographs of the couple, they can be seen decked out in their ski kit as they prepare for a day on the slopes. King Frederik frowned while placing his hands on his hips and appearing to speak to Mary, while the mother-of-four turned away from her husband with an impatient look on her face.\n\nIn the days that followed, the Queen went on to make a number of solo appearances at royal engagements - while the King and Queen weren’t seen out in public together at all. In fact, over the course of a week Queen Mary has appeared three times on engagements on her own, without her husband. On April 3, she was seen visiting the Freedom museum in Copenhagen to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the National Guard. Days later, she joined Denmark’s Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke to open a Deer Park in Copenhagen. On April 9, she visited the National Museum of Denmark."
