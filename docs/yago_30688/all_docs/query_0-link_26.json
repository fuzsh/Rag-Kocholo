        "text": "Princess Margaret of Denmark's former home, built into the stone walls of a French Riviera fortress, is going up for auction – and it is expected to sell for around $12 million.\n\nThe six-bedroom mansion known as La Carriere is located in Villefranche-sur-Mer, nestled between Monaco and Nice. Overlooking the French Riviera, the historical residence dates back to the 1920s before serving as the residence of the Danish royal.\n\nThe villa is one of the most historic properties on the Côte d'Azur – and one of the world's best homes – combining Mediterranean beauty with unrivaled privacy (this is a fortress, after all).\n\nMargrethe II, Princess Margaret was the fifth child of Prince Valdemar of Denmark and the cousin of Queen Elizabeth of England. She was intricately connected to royal families around the continent, with family in Russia, Greece, Hanover, Orléans, and Spain – the latter being the birthplace of her husband, Prince René of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nThe couple primarily resided in France; however, they fled the country during World War II. Escaping through Spain to Portugal and later New York, the princess worked as a hatmaker until the war concluded, and they could return to Paris.\n\nThe home's striking façade foreshadows its equally majestic interiors – perhaps most evident in the living room. The space exhibits antique high-beamed ceilings, a fireplace, and arched windows-and-stone accents that uphold its enduring style.\n\nThese architectural assets continue in the kitchen and formal dining space – complete with a separate breakfast table and ample room for entertaining guests. The five-bedroom home has a series of terraces that offer views of the Riviera, Villefranche Bay, and the impressive local commune, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.\n\nOther stand-out features include a jacuzzi (on one of the terraces) and a maze of landscaped grounds filled with mature trees, flower-filled gardens, and a pool surrounded by a stone grotto. The pool complex also includes a detached studio, offering yet more room for overnight guests.\n\nBeyond the villa's grounds, the Côte d'Azur offers the most exclusive shopping and dining experiences internationally. It has long served as a summer destination for Europe’s royalty, global celebrities, and artists, including Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Currently, Bill Gates, Elton John, and Bono own villas in the area."
