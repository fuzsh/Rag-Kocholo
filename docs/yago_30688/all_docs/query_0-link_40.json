        "text": "The Côte d’Azur estate where Princess Margaret of Denmark and Prince René of Bourbon-Parma made their home has recently been listed for sale at a no-reserve auction.\n\nOverlooking the French Riviera, the one-of-a-kind residence is known as La Carriere, which dates back to the 1920s.\n\nThe majestic manor was built into the stone walls of a fortress, melding rustic charm with modern luxury, while the walls provide the ultimate in privacy and security, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.\n\nRELATED: Why Charles is now new King of UK real estate\n\nMike Myers lists huge apartment for $30m\n\nRicky Ponting ends innings at beachside mansion to ‘downsize’\n\nThe property is scheduled to head under the hammer on May 16, with the listed price guide prior to auction set at $12 million.\n\nArched windows-and-stone accents give the villa a unique and enduring style. Antique high-beamed ceilings and a majestic fireplace add grandeur to the living room.\n\nThe Five-bedroom, six-bathroom home offers plenty of room for family and guests, while a spacious kitchen and gorgeous formal dining room are perfect for entertaining.\n\nMORE: Proptrack rental report for the March quarter\n\nMultiple terraces and turrets offer generous views of the Riviera, and the rooftop deck also boasts a hot tub.\n\nThe landscaped grounds include lush lawns, mature trees, beautiful gardens, plus a pool surrounded by a stone grotto.

One of the world’s first resort areas, it has long been a summer destination for Europe’s royalty, world celebrities, and artists, including Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.\n\nLa Carriere is located in the town of Villefranche-sur-Mer, nestled between Nice and Monaco — with Bill Gates, Elton John and Bono all known to own villas nearby.\n\nSign up to the Herald Sun Weekly Real Estate Update.
