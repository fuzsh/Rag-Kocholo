        "text": "Margrethe II, Queen of Denmark (born Princess Margrethe of Denmark on 16 April 1940) is the current reigning Queen of Denmark. She is the eldest daughter of King Frederik IX of Denmark and Princess Ingrid of Sweden. She is also a member of the extended Swedish Royal Family as the granddaughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.\n\nLife[]\n\nAt the time of her birth, only males could inherit the throne of Denmark. As Margrethe had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle, Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, would succeed her father. The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after Margrethe's father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederik and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution.\n\nOn 27 March 1953, the new Act of Succession was passed and Margrethe became heiress presumptive.\n\nMarriage and Issue[]\n\nAfter ascending the throne at the age of 32 and still unmarried, many began to speculate about the new queen's marriage prospects and the future of the monarchy. During an official visit to Paris in 1966, the then-Princess Margrethe had met French nobleman Michael, Count of Monpezat. Her father, however, was against the match and forbade them from marrying. Instead, the couple discreetly dated for seven years, until the king passed and Margrethe took the throne.\n\nOn 5 October 1973, the Danish court announced Margrethe and Michael's engagement. The couple were married in Copenhagen on 10 June 1974. It was the first marriage of a reigning Danish monarch since King Christian VII married Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain in 1796. After nine years of marriage, Margrethe gave birth to their only child, Frederika, in 1985 at the age of forty-five.\n\nOn 13 February 1987, Margrethe and Michael were involved in a car accident outside of Copenhagen. Margrethe survived with minor injuries, however Michael was thrown from the vehicle and killed instantly.\n\nResidences[]\n\nSartorial Information[]\n\nTiara Collection[]\n\nAs queen, Margrethe has access to the entirety of the Danish Tiara Collection. Below are the tiaras that she personally owns.\n\nClothing Collection[]\n\nTBD\n\nTitles and Honours[]\n\n1940-1953 Princess Margrethe of Denmark\n\n1963-1972 Margrethe, Crown Princess of Denmark\n\n1972-present Queen Margrethe of Denmark\n\nNational Honours[]\n\nOrder of the Elephant (1958)\n\nOrder of the Dannebrog (1972)\n\nForeign Honours[]\n\nTBD\n\nAncestry[]\n\nParents Grandparents Great-Grandparents Great-Great-Grandparents King Frederik IX of Denmark King Christian X of Denmark\n\nPrincess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nKing Frederik VIII of Denmark\n\nPrincess Louise of Sweden\n\nGrand Duke Frederick Francis III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nGrand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark\n\nPrincess Louise of Hesse-Kassel\n\nKing Charles XI of Sweden\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands\n\nGrand Duke Frederick Francis II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nPrincess Augusta of Reuss\n\nGrand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia\n\nPrincess Cecilie of Baden\n\nPrincess Ingrid of Sweden King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught\n\nKing Gustaf V of Sweden\n\nPrincess Victoria of Baden\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn\n\nPrincess Louise Margaret of Prussia\n\nKing Oscar II of Sweden\n\nPrincess Sophia of Nassau\n\nGrand Duke Frederick I of Baden\n\nPrincess Louise of Prussia\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom\n\nPrince Friedrich Karl of Prussia\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Anhalt-Dessau\n\nLines of Succession[]"
