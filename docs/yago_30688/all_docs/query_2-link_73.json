Dorothea quietly and efficiently handled many of the kingdom's financial matters which her husband preferred not to be bothered with, as well as being in complete control of the management of her own estates. The queen was also instrumental in founding the University of Copenhagan.[4][5] Because intermittent discussions between Denmark and Scotland concerning a marriage between Margaret and the young Scottish king began as early as 1458 (when Margaret was only a few years old), [6] it is highly probable that Dorothea herself oversaw the early education of a daughter who was most likely to become a future queen.\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nMargaret of Denmark was married 13 July 1469 at Holyrood to James III, King of Scots.[1][2] She was thirteen years old, and the groom had just celebrated his eighteenth birthday. Under the terms of the marriage contract 1) Scotland's debt owing on the Western Isles was completely written off; 2) King Christian agreed to pay 60,000 florin (£20,000) for Margaret's dowry, of which 50,000 was to be written off in return for Norway pledging its rights in Orkney to Scotland (as the king was unable to raise the remaining 10,000 florin, that amount was also written off in exchange for Norway pledging its rights in the Shetlands to Scotland); 3) James was to provide the Palace of Linlithgow and the Castle of Doune for Margaret's jointure; and 4) a third of the royal revenue was to be settled on Margaret if she survived her husband.[7]\n\nThere were three children from this marriage:\n\nJames IV, King of Scots; b. 17 Mar 1472/3;[1][8] m. 8 Aug 1503 Margaret Tudor;[1][8] d. 9 Sep 1513[1][8]\n\nJames Stewart, Archbishop of St Andrews; Duke of Ross; Marquess of Ormond; b. Mar 1475/6;[1][9] d. 12-17 Jan 1503/4[9][10]\n\nJohn Stewart, earl of Mar; b. Dec 1479;[11][1] d. 11 Mar 1502/3[12][1]\n\nQueen Consort/Queen Mother\n\nAlthough one biographer, Giovanni Sabadino, writing four years after Margaret's death, claimed that she was more loved and revered by the people than the king himself \"because she possessed more aptitude than he for ruling the kingdom\"[13] there is no evidence to suggest that the king and queen worked together to govern Scotland, or that Margaret was included in any political decisions.[14] Her name appeared on only one grant issued in the king's name, rewarding John Dundas for his actions taken to liberate James III in 1482 from Edinburgh Castle, where he was being held prisoner.[14]\n\nSabadino also suggested that Margaret and her brother-in-law, Alexander, duke of Albany, acted together to have the king imprisoned \"for the good of the kingdom.\"[13] These allegations cannot be proven. What is certain is that in 1478 the king appointed Margaret as guardian of their young son James, who was heir to the throne. In that position, she was later able to exert a great deal of influence in arranging the king's release (in 1482) from Edinburgh Castle.[14] Albany was required to seek her advice (as the heir's guardian) before taking any actions himself, and she was able to communicate with her husband through Lord Darnley, whom she paid as the keeper of Edinburgh.[15] Margaret insisted that during the period of the king's imprisonment the government continue to funtion in his name, and later historians have credited her actions with the relatively prompt and bloodless way the crisis was resolved and the king released.[15] It is possible, however, that there were rumors of collusion between Albany and the queen and that those rumors caused James III to distrust his wife.[6] On his release, the king chose to continue living at Edinburgh while the queen remained in her dower castle at Stirling with their three children. There is no evidence that they ever saw each other again after the events of 1482.[6]\n\nDeath\n\nQueen Margaret died at Stirling Castle on 14 July 1486, and was buried at Cambuskenneth Abbey later that same month.[2][16][17] The following year the king made an attempt to secure her canonization, although his efforts may have been motivated by a desire to quell (possibly unfounded) rumors that she had been poisoned by one of his own closest advisors.[6][15]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 Paul, Sir James Balfour.
