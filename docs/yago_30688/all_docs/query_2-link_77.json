Once Europe’s only reigning queens, the royals are third cousins via Queen Victoria and Denmark’s King Christian IX – so King Charles is linked too\n\nSTORYFaye Bradley\n\nJan 4 , 2024\n\nDenmark’s Queen Margrethe will be formally stepping down from her role as the nation’s monarch on January 14, according to the royal. “I will leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik,” she announced in her new year TV address on December 31.\n\n“The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future – whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,” she said, referring to a procedure she underwent on her back in early 2023.\n\nThe 83-year-old is the world’s only reigning queen, having previously shared the title with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth. She took the throne in 1972, after the death of her father King Frederik, making her the longest-serving current monarch in Europe, according to the BBC.\n\nBut did you know she’s actually related to the late Queen Elizabeth? Here’s what you need to know about her extended royal family in Britain.\n\nHow are Queen Elizabeth and Queen Margrethe related?\n\nAccording to the Daily Express, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark are third cousins, with their lineages tracing back to Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark. Both women were Queen Victoria’s great granddaughters.\n\nBut it’s not just Elizabeth who’s related to Margrethe among the British royals. The same report says that Queen Margrethe is also a relative of the late Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband, via ancestry through Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark – with Philip being born a Prince of Greece and Denmark himself.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and Queen Margrethe were good friends\n\nBesides being distant relatives, the two figures were known to be good friends until Elizabeth’s death in 2022 at the age of 96. Per The Independent, their companionship went back decades and they shared a love of dogs.\n\nThey even referred to each other by their affectionate nicknames – namely “Daisy” (Margrethe) and “Lilibet” (Elizabeth).\n\nAt what age did Queen Margrethe became queen?\n\nMargrethe became Denmark’s monarch in 1972 when she was 31 after the death of her father King Frederik IX. Elizabeth became queen a fair bit earlier in 1952, when she was 25, following the death of her father King George VI.\n\nHow is King Charles related to Queen Margrethe?\n\nOf course Britain’s current monarch King Charles is also distantly related to Queen Margrethe via Queen Victoria, as Business Insider points out. Fittingly, Queen Margrethe was reportedly the first foreign monarch to send a letter of condolence to King Charles upon the death of his mother.\n\nDenmark’s Queen Margrethe will be formally stepping down from her role as the nation’s monarch on January 14 – her son, Crown Prince Frederik, will take over the throne\n\nBut did you know she’s actually related to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth? Here’s what you need to know about her extended, blue-blooded family, from King Charles to Prince Philip"
