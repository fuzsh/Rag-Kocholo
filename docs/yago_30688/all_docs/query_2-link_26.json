        "text": "On May 14, 2004, then-Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark married Australian Mary Donaldson in a lavish royal wedding at in Copenhagen Cathedral, and today the couple, now the King and Queen of Denmark, are marking their milestone 20th anniversary in Oslo at the start of a state visit to Norway.\n\nFrederik and Mary set off from Denmark yesterday aboard the royal yacht Dannebrog ahead of their official business, and this morning shared an adorable photo from the yacht's deck, complete with matching puffer vests. Mary kept it cool in a pair of chic Gucci sunglasses in a shade of coordinating navy blue.\n\nThey later disembarked Oslo to be greeted by members of the Norwegian royal family, including Crown Prince Haakon and his wife Crown Princess Mette-Marit, Queen Sonja, and King Harald himself. The 87 year old, who currently holds the title of Europe's oldest monarch, has been operating under a reduced schedule after a series of health issues earlier this year which culminated in the placement of a permanent pacemaker in March.\n\nHowever, the Norwegian king looked jovial as he greeted the Danish leaders on their special day—particularly poignant considering that not only were he and Queen Sonja among the guests at Frederik and Mary's wedding, he also shares a family connection to the royals; he and Frederik's mother, the former Queen Margrethe, are second cousins.\n\nFor their day of events, including a visit to the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, Mary swapped her laid-back nautical look for a lilac and blue printed skirt and a demure white jacket topped with a blue feathered fascinator that paid a subtle homage to their wedding anniversary with a delicate veil.\n\nFrederik and Mary's trip to Norway marks their second official state visit abroad since becoming King and Queen this January. Frederik took the throne after his mother, Margrethe, unexpectedly announced in her New Year's speech that she would be abdicating."
