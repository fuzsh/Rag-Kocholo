        "text": "Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. She was the younger sister and only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nPrincess Margaret was born at 9:22 p.m. on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle in Scotland, her mother's ancestral home, and was affectionately known as Margot within the royal family. She was the first member of the royal family in direct line of succession to be born in Scotland since the 1600s.\n\nMarriage and Family[]\n\nMarriage[]\n\nMargaret met the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones at a supper party in 1958. They became engaged in October 1959. The couple got married at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 1960. The ceremony was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television, and it attracted viewing figures of 300 million worldwide. 2,000 guests were invited for the wedding ceremony.\n\nChildren[]\n\nIn 1961, Margaret's husband was created Earl of Snowdon. The couple had two children: David, born 3 November 1961, and Sarah, born 1 May 1964.\n\nSeparation and Divorce[]\n\nBoth parties in the marriage regularly engaged in extra-marital relationships. On 19 March 1976, the Snowdons publicly acknowledged that their marriage had irretrievably broken down and had decided to separate. On 11 July 1978, the Snowdons' divorce was finalized. It was the first divorce of a senior member of the British royal family since Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh's in 1901.\n\nDeath[]\n\nPrincess Margaret died in the King Edward VII's Hospital, London, at 06:30 GMT on 9 February 2002, aged 71, three days after the 50th anniversary of her father's death. She was eleventh in the line to the throne at the time of her death. The previous day, she had suffered another stroke that was followed by cardiac problems. Her sister's eldest son, Charles, then Prince of Wales, paid tribute to his aunt in a television broadcast.\n\nTitles[]"
