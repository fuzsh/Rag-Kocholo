The residence of Princess Margaret of Denmark and Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, the estate’s history is as rich and vibrant as its architecture. This majestic manor home dates back to 1920, constructed within the stone walls of a fortress. Secluded and private, the unique location creates an atmosphere of immediate and inviting tranquility. Admire stunning views of Villefranche’s iconic bay, Cap Ferrat, and the gardens, turrets and ramparts that surround your personal oasis. Get a bird’s eye view of the French Riviera from the terrace crowning the estate. Contemporary luxury peeks through historic charm throughout the main villa: linger over a gourmet meal in the formal dining room, where neutral walls put vast arched windows at the center of attention, framing the ancient stone fortress beyond. In the living room, beamed ceilings soar above a majestic stone fireplace. Gather here with friends and family to honor the rich history of this estate and rejoice in its next chapter.\n\nProperty details provided by seller or others; buyer to verify.",
