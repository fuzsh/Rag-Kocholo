        "text": "Chapter 1. A joyous Entry in summer of 1468\n\nPortrait of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York by Hans Memling, 1470-72. The duchess is wearing her necklace of white and red roses, as a symbol of her english heritage.\n\nThe marriage of Margaret of York and Charles, Duke of Burgundy got off to a grand start. After a short, but hard crossing over the English Channel, the sister of Edward IV of England arrived with her retinue at Sluis on the evening of Saturday on the 25th of June in 1468. There they were greeted by the Bishop of Utrecht and the Countess of Charny, her bridegroom’s illegitimate half-siblings by the late Duke Philip the Good. The english princess received a magnificent welcome with burning torches held by the people lit in the already darkened port.\n\nThe chief burghers of the city gave their new duchess a purse with twelve gold marks upon her arrival and escorted her to the residence of the wealthy merchant, Guy van Baenst, who had lent his town house to her for the stay. Margaret would enjoy the pageantry at Sluis for a week until she moved onwards to Damme by a barge up the river where the celebrations continued with great magnificence.\n\nIn Sluis, three days after her arrival Charles the Bold himself met his bride for the first time. The meeting was formal, and Margaret was acclaimed as duchess of Burgundy with him besides her. Charles and Margaret were married in Damme in a private ceremony, whereupon Charles left for Bruges, to give his new wife the full honours of a Joyeuse Entrée into the city on her own.\n\nThe full celebrations of Margaret’s entrée would be the immortalised in the memory of history with great progressions from attending merchants from all over Europe. Writers identified Florentines, Genoese, Spanish and Scots among very many others in the large crowds. All were finely attired in silk, brocade and embroidered velvets and the bishops and abbots from all over Charles’s realm lead large entourage with papal crosses soaring above. The city magistrates and musicians clad in black damask completed the picture.\n\nThe ducal household, which consisted of chamberlains, councillors and servants, attended as well, wearing the Burgundian colours in purple, crimson and black. Bruges itself had put on a festival outfit, tapestries and flowers decked the houses and spectators crammed for the best view of their new duchess as well as the spectacular pageants, many which displayed biblical themes as well as those grounded in classical mythology. Esther and Ahasuerus, the Song of Solomon and the marriage at Cana mixed with the deeds of Heracles and Cleopatra and Alexander the Great.\n\nOliver de la Marche and Jacques de Villiers were the geniuses behind the decorations and had a whole army of craftsmen from the whole of the duchy and artists to make the pageants for this marriage. Their work certainly paid off, as the arrival of Margaret in Bruges would be immortalised in the Burgundian lore and even re-enacted for tourists today. The rain would however put a damper on the whole thing, but Margaret charmed her subjects by waving at them from her carriage.\n\nThe new duchess reached the ducal palace, brightly decorated with sculptured fountains flowing with wine and ippocras (mead and honey) for a private mass and rest before the dinner later. The banquet that followed was even more festive than the entrée into Bruges.\n\nNine days of feasting on gilded swans, peacocks and oranges, luxuries from the ducal court at that time, while by mimes enacted the deeds of Heracles and danced. The nine days seemed to have exhausted the Englishman John Paston, as evident by his letter home:\n\nAs for the Duke’s Court of ladies and gentlewomen, knights, squires and gentlemen I heard never on none like it save King Arthur’s court…for of such gear and gold and pearl and stones they of the Duke’s Court, neither gentlemen or gentlewomen they want non; for without that they have it by wishes, by my thoth, I have never of so great plenty as there is.\n\nLater came the tournament of The Golden Tree, arranged by Anthony, Count of La Roche, in an epic display of both chivalry and brutality. Margaret was the centre of attention, as the valiant knights would honour their new duchess. The participants were richly dressed with their horses clothed in gold and silver fabric and harness. The fighting itself were brutal, La Roche broke a leg and other knights were wounded in the joust, to the point of alarming Margaret who signalled her husband, himself in the thick of it, to put a stop before it got even more out of hand. The victors were Sir Edward Woodville, brother to the queen of England and Lord d’Argueil, brother to the Prince of Orange.\n\nThe celebrations ended on 13 July when Charles the Bold left for Holland and Zeeland. The english guests returned home and the Burgundian went back to work. All of them with a wonderous memory of the greatest marriage of the century.\n\nMargaret herself set off to journey into her new homeland to get to know her people and the realms that would define her life from here on out.\n\nSource: Christine Weightman, Madam La Grande – The life of Margaret of York\n\nAuthor's note. This is just a rehash of the first chapter in my other tl, but with better sentence structure and minor things fixed. The butterflies has not yet started to flap, so hold on until chapter four.\n\nChapter 2. An even more joyous birth in April 1469\n\nMargaret of York’s new titles as Duchess of Burgundy were extensive. Burgundy and Lothringia, the duchy of Brabant, Limbourg, Luxembourg and Guelders, Countess of Flanders and Artois, of Burgundy, of Hainault, Holland, Zeeland, Namur and Zuphten, Marchioness of the Holy Roman Empire, Lady of Friesland, Salins and Malines and so on. In 1468 her husband’s realm encompassed some of the most extensive gatherings of territories in the early renaissance. The duchy would rival and outshine many other realms. A rich one, in both people and resources, it lay along the trade routes of Europe. Both northern wares, such as fish and fur, alongside southern olives and wine would flow in, meeting the industrial craftsmen in Ghent, Liege and Brussels. Burgundy was immense and dynamic realm.\n\nMargaret of York performing praying in front of the St Gudula Church in Brussels\n\nMargaret took a very active part in the duchy, like the previous duchesses had done. Husband and wife spent much time traveling through various cities, like from Boulogne to Brussels, from Burges to Picardy, to Flanders and Brabant. Margaret had reached Aire, near St Omer, in September 1468 when she started to feel strange and faint. She had to rest for a while, something that worried her household. Was their new mistress ill with some malady?\n\nFortunately, she got better and left for Brussels, traveling across Brabant in the one of the worst Novembers and arriving at Brussels. In late November, a physician was called to confirm what Margaret suspected and the overjoyed duchess was able to tell her duke that their marriage would bear fruit after the summer’s celebrations. Margaret of York was indeed pregnant.\n\nThe news that Burgundy might have a male heir spread over Europe like wildfire. If the duchess gave birth to a living son, then Mary of Burgundy would not inherit her father’s domains. The news is said to have angered King Louis XI of France, who stated “and despite all of my effort, that insufferable lady might triumph after all!” Edward IV of England was delighted at the news and sent both gifts and regards for his sister, promising Charles that he was a great ally and much more. Even Emperor Frederick III sent a envoy to discuss a alliance between the Holy Roman Emperor and Burgundy and to give his personal regards to Margaret, whom he declared was a woman “much fit for a splendid realm”.\n\nMargaret spent the spring in the ducal palace in Ghent. The choice of place to deliver her child had been determined by Charles’s sometimes tense relationships with the city. Ghent continued to be a source of the rebellions that occasionally broke out in the northern provinces and the political capital of Flanders. Having his potential son being born there was a massive part of securing the loyalty of the turbulent duchy.\n\nThe pregnant duchess spent her time reading, playing chess as well and keeping herself updated on matters of state. She was accompanied by Mary, her twelve-year-old stepdaughter and heiress presumptive, as well as dowager Duchess Isabella of Portugal, her mother in law. Those two ladies greatly eased Margaret’s confinement when her pregnancy progressed.\n\nOn the third of April, early in the evening, Margaret gave birth to a healthy son. to great joy of the court, the duchy and all the citizens of the large realm. Charles the Bold had a male heir at least. The future Duke of Burgundy had arrived.\n\nAuthor's note: Not much to say here, but once more minor improvements.\n\nChapter 3. A Burgundian Prince – Spring and Summer 1469\n\nThe birth of a son could not have overjoyed Charles more than if he was also granted the title of Holy Roman Emperor at the same time. The infant was named Philip in honour of his grandfather, Philip the Good and his christening a week later at the Sint-Baafs Cathedral in Ghent. His godparents were Edward IV of England, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick, as well as Elizabeth Woodville and Isabella of Portugal, dowager duchess. All but Isabella was represented by stand ins. To quell the rumours that the baby had been another girl (spread by whispering tongues), Isabella lifted Philip up in the air after the christening and unwrapped his splendid swaddling, to show that the new heir truly had been a boy.\n\nMargaret of York remained at Ghent with her baby until late May, on the 19th she and Philip travelled to Bruges with the rest of the court. She was welcome by spectators and burgers, being gifted with gold plates, wines, and a jewelled cup by the city elders. Bruges were also a strongest force in Flanders, along with Ypres and Ghent.\n\nThe process did a lot to calm down the cities as Margaret showed plenty of attention to Flanders during the coming months. The result was that the tension between the ducal couple and the strong headed estates had mellowed, as Margaret had gained more popularity during the past months. She had shown an openness to the city unlike Charles, who’s hard hand was the reason for a lot of chafe. The birth of Philip had settled many fears about the future of Burgundy and if there was no large change overall, there was a sense of peace now.\n\nNaturally from the moment of his birth Philip of Burgundy was the subject of marriage proposals; his cousin Mary of York b 1467 was the strongest considered, but Philippa of Guelders, Catherine of Navarre and Isabella of Naples were also contenders by his father. An early proposal to England was sent to England in the summer, supported by Margaret. Princess Mary could become the future duchess if she got her way.\n\nMary of Burgundy’s marriage also came up now that she had a brother. Both Charles and Margaret turned their attentions to Nicholas of Anjou, heir to Lorraine, the duchy rivalling Burgundy to settle peace with them. Nicholas’s mother, Marie de Bourbon had been sister to Mary's mother, Isabella de Bourbon and thus he was Mary's first cousin. Nicholas was 21 to Mary’s twelve, but negotiations started anyway. Charles wanted to wait until Mary had turned 16 before any marriage took place, mostly to see if baby Philip would survive infancy and to perhaps have more children with Margaret to ensure the succession. And in late summer, he once more called his wife to bed.\n\nNicholas of Anjou, heir to the duchy of Lorraine\n\nIn July Margaret went traveling again and Philip was left at Ghent, with his own small household, his wet-nurse, a woman from Brussels cared for her little charge with utter care. Her son was strong and healthy, so Margaret had no immense fear of leaving him in capable hands. The duchess had also greatly improved his apartments and Ten Waele would continue to be one of the grandest castles in Flanders.\n\nMore importantly, Margaret would indeed become pregnant again in august of 1469. Both she and Charles hoped for a second son to be born in early April, once more.\n\nAuthors note: A butterfly is flapping now, Mary is betrothed to Nicholas of Anjou rather then Maximilian of Austria.\n\nChapter 4. An English Storm 1470-72\n\nWhile the marriage of Margaret of York to Charles the Bold’s marriage to Margaret of York had been a grand success for Edward IV of England. misfortune struck shortly after Margaret left. Elizabeth Woodville died in childbirth with a stillborn daughter in the summer, leaving Edward a widow with two toddling girls, Elizabeth, and Mary of York.\n\nThe Woodville faction quickly pushed quickly for another bride from their family, seventeen-year-old Eleanor Woodville, the late queen’s unmarried sister. Several members of the nobility were alarmed by how quickly the many pushy and greedy relatives moved to engulf king and country, especially Richard Neville, the 16th earl of Warwick and Edward’s brother George, Duke of Clarence. The winter and spring of the shifting year of 1469 to 1470 saw a dwindling support for Edward and the Lancastrian’s cause being raised from the apparent dead.\n\nLouis XI of France was of course the backer behind the resurgent of Margaret of Anjou and her son, Edward of Westminster, only legitimate child of the deposed Henry VI of England. With both Warwick and Clarence throwing their support behind Margaret and even marrying Edward to Anne Neville, Warwick’s younger daughter, Charles and Burgundy saw the writing on the wall. Margaret herself wrote to both of her brothers while the duke repeatedly warned Edward IV of the upcoming danger. Sadly, it had little effect. Edward was unprepared to handle the invasion of Lancastrian forces early spring and had to flee England for the safety of the Low Countries.\n\nWarwick the Kingmaker, 16th century portrait.\n\nThe arrival of the king of England as a penniless refugee incurred Charles’s wrath. Now having been proved that Edward neither sought or heard council from his allies, Charles refused to meet them and instead allowed the Lord of Gruuthuyse to take Edward and his brother, Richard, duke of Gloucester in.\n\nDespite the duchess of Burgundy begging her husband to see her brother, Charles refused to let her travel to the Hauge and instead ordered her to stay near Brussels. The official reason was of course that since his wife was once more pregnant, having conceived in in late summer, Charles did not want Margaret to have any increased turbulence now that her lying in occurred in the palace of Brussels.\n\nBy early march the duke joined his wife at Brussels and finally, after both countless petitions and the threat of Louis XI became too great, Edward of York met him there. With both his own heir Philip’s and his brother-in laws realms in danger, Charles at last provided the backing to take back England for the York cause. 30, 000 crowns and around seventeen ships, by both the duchy and the Hanseatic Traders provided enough for the expedition. An agreement to wed Mary to Philip also concluded the alliance, with the understanding that Edward would pay the dowry in return for Charles’s help later.\n\nMargaret herself actively raised money for her brother’s mission from her dower towns. However, her activities became limited as her entered her lying in. After midnight at the 9th of April the duchess gave birth to a daughter. The infant, despite being female, was as strong as her brother, proving her lung capacity to the degree that the attendants said it was a boy. Charles himself did not consider his newborn daughter as a waste, rather as a hope for his dynasty. Margaret herself was delighted with her little girl and remained at Brussel until the summer, recovering from the birth. The little girl christened Isabella for her grandmother, Isabella of Portugal, would remain at the castle, as her brother Philip stayed in Ghent for the time being. The little boy had become an energic and curious toddler.\n\nMonforte Altarpiece, The adorations of King, by Hugo van der Goes.\n\nThe altarpiece was made around the time of Isabella's birth and the virgin is believed to have been in the likeness of the duchess Margaret. Hugo van der Goes worked with the decorations that celebrated the marriage in 1468.\n\nThe birth of Isabella and the news from England, that Edward IV had retaken his throne would provide joy to Burgundy and the summer were spend mostly in peace. Edward would suffer another tragic loss however, as his eldest daughter Elizabeth of York had been taken into care of her uncle George when London ended under siege. The little girl had perished in his custody, most likely from lack of care. The loss made George and Warwick to turn desperate as they now were seen as having murdered a beautiful princess and they became more unpopular as ever. Mary of York thus remained her father’s only legitimate child and Edward desperately needed a new bride. His first option had been Mary of Burgundy, but her father were not willing to give his daughter to Edward as the betrothal to Lorraine became more important.\n\nAnother option was Princess Joanna of Portugal, the daughter of King Alfonso V of Portugal. However, the lady in question did not wish to wed at all and after a few months, the marriage talks had been abandoned. Another pressing issue was that Anne Neville had become pregnant during her marriage to Edward of Westminster after the autumn and if she were to bear a son, the Lancastrians could reasonable strengthen their claim to England.\n\nHowever, Edward would find a bride in 1470 from Scotland. The second daughter of James II and Mary of Guelders had been born in 1455 and thus 15 years old at the time. As Margaret Stewart came with a dowry, a royal linage and a assurance that the Lancastrians would find no support in Scotland, Edward signed the marriage contract and wedded her in November that very year.\n\nMargaret of Scotland, Queen of England from 1470\n\nThe marriage between Edward and Margaret did not turn out to be a great match. The king stood as tall as 6 feet four, being known as an energetic and handsome man who easily captured the eyes of the ladies in court. By comparison, the queen was short, fat and pasty with thin hair, an overly large nose, and a shrill voice. While no one could say that she was not a kind person to her ladies and loving stepmother to little Mary of York, the courtiers and nobles had a cold reaction to her.\n\nThe pressure to produce a son was high from the first days and increased after Anne Neville’s pregnancy progressed during the winter. Margaret did not fell pregnant until early spring, announcing her pregnancy in March 1471, a few weeks before Anne Neville became due with her baby. Anne Neville delivered a son to Edward of Westminster, while Margaret gave birth to a daughter in the middle of December. The little girl was christened Cecily for her grandmother, Cecily Neville.\n\nThe resurgence of Lancastrians ended at the Battle of Tewkesbury in May of 1471. Despite the recent increase in support for Edward of Westminster and Warwick being on his side, Edward won the battle with decisive force, smashing through the enemy forces like a giant. His brother Richard, Duke Gloucester commanded the vanguard and aided the victory for the king. Both Warwick and Westminster were killed during the action and the surviving Lancastrian commanders hunted down and executed afterwards. Margaret of Anjou ended up as a prisoner of Edward and imprisoned in the Tower of London.\n\nAnother stroke of fortune for Edward came after Christmas, as the infant son of Westminster and Anne Neville died at seventh months old of a fever. In the spring of 1472 Anne was allowed to marry Richard, her childhood sweetheart. However, as Edward held his brother George responsible for his daughter Elizabeth’s death, Edward took several parts of the Warwick’s estates before he allowed the match. The act infuriated George, but as he was rather dependant of his brother’s grace now, he stayed put, simmering with fury.\n\nAnne and Richard would have two daughters, Joan, and Eleanor in 1475 and 1478 during their marriage.\n\nThe sole Lancastrian threat to the Yorks now consisted solely of the fourteen-year-old Henry Tudor, hiding in Brittany. Edward’s reign from here on out stayed mostly peaceful until his death in 1482, when the crisis came back in full force.\n\nHis relationship with Queen Margaret would yield three more children, Edward in 1475, Richard in 1477 who died in 1481 and Margaret in 1480.\n\nUnfortunately for Edward and his grand plans, neither of his children would live to take the throne after his passing. But that was unknown in 1472.\n\nKing Edward IV of England\n\nAuthors note: More butterflies are flapping. Isabella of Burgundy is born a year earlier, Elizabeth Woodville dies much earlier and England gets a new queen.\n\nChapter 5. Castile and Aragon 1470-78\n\nHowever, the world did not sole rest on Burgundy and England. The developments in Spain at during the 1470s is an interesting tale. The marriage of Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon would be the start of a united Iberia empire, the two spouses being the heirs to Castile and Aragon respectively. However, Isabel’s claim to the throne were not recognised by all, her half-brother Henry IV of Castile had a daughter, a girl shrouded in rumours of bastardy: Juana La Beltraneja. Isabel’s marriage to Ferdinand would prove fruitful, something that would tip the balance in her favour. To start with, Isabel gave birth to a son on the second of October in 1470. The new-born prince, named Juan, gave his parents the best possible triumph. To compare her rival was the daughter of Henry IV, a girl named Juana, view as a illegitimate bastard by the queen’s lover. Juan’s birth was proof that the marriage was blessed.\n\nThe threat from La Beltraneja increased in 1473 when King Henry IV got ill. The king’s conditions left the future of the realm uncertain. Would the throne go to Juana La Beltraneja, a eleven year old girl considered a bastard, who despite that had the backing of Portugal, her mother’s family or Isabel, still recognised as Princess of Asturias, a twenty two years old with a toddling son and the support of Aragon.\n\nEvents in 1474 did however tip the board of balance. In 27th of August, three months before the death of Henry IV of Castile, Isabel got pregnant again. Upon hearing off the death of Henry Isabella crowned herself queen in front of the church of San Martin, dressed in a splendidly rich gown with jewels and gold. Her son Juan, dressed in fine cloth of gold attended his mother’s coronation. She also announced her second pregnancy, telling the nobles that “a most noble and legitimate child of Castile and Aragon is resting beneath my heart.”\n\nIsabel I of Castile\n\nFerdinand had earlier taken precautions to make sure that the people knew their son was male, to prevent rumours that Juan was not a infanta. Taking a page from Burgundy’s christening of Philip, the infant had been unclothed and shown to the masses to assure its gender. Isabella had not been amused with displaying her naked baby, but it did effectively repel any doubt.\n\n“It would be safe to say that Juan’s birth assured his mother’s ultimate victory against Portugal in the struggles during the War of the Castilian Succession. The turbulent years of 1475-78 would be hectic, but the little prince spent his first years in various strongholds with his sister, Isabel and a loyal and warm household guarded to the teeth. Isabel and Ferdinand would not see their children very often during those two years, but their fight was for them, always.”\n\nCoronation scene from the Spanish tv-serie Isabel.\n\nIn April of 1475 Isabel gave birth to her second child, Infanta Isabella of Aragon. While a second son would have been even more desired, a infanta provided Isabel and Ferdinand with an utter iron-clad resolve to win and the battle of Toro would be a hard won victory for the Castilians and Aragonese troops the month after. The war still went on, but the Portuguese slipped more and more after Toro and King Alfonso VI of Portugal showed less enthusiasm for his young wife’s cause. He had married Juana La Beltraneja after Henry IV’s death, but that marriage had legal problems, Alfonso had not been granted a proper dispensation.\n\nIsabel and Ferdinand were also gaining ground with the nobility, particularity with the Giron-Pancheco families, and the submissions in Andalusia, especially in Seville. That strengthened the crowns possession and La Beltraneja’s support failed even more. The summer of 1477 proved the final nail in the coffin for her. Despite the revolt of some nobles royal to her, it would prove futile. The pope’s annulment of Joanna’s sketchy marriage to her uncle would prove the final blow as well as the submitting of the cities Medellin and Merida to Isabel and Ferdinand in December.\n\nIn summer of 1478, in Toledo, Isabel gave birth to a second daughter, named Juana.\n\nAfter her churching, the Monarchs summoned the Cortes and Juan, now eight years old, were sworn in as Prince of Asturias. The war was now over, even if the negotiations took a long time to finish. The monarchs of Spain had won.\n\nIsabel and Ferdinand would go on to have more children, infante Ferdinand in 1482 and infanta Catalina in 1485. With Juan, Isabella and Juana, the two youngest children rounded up the family of Castile and Aragon.\n\nSource: Ana Mendoza Lopez, Isabel and Ferdinand – The Catholic Monarchs\n\nAuthors note: Ferdinand and Isabel had a son in 1470 instead of a daughter, the 1475 misscarriage turned out to be Isabella of Aragon and Infanta Maria became infante Ferdinand instead. Catherine of Aragon arrived in her splendour as otl, because she's my girl as always."
