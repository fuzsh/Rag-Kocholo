        "text": "Question generally about royal marriage. Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark but if they'd never met, would she have to find someone similarly royal?\n\nProblem the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret had to face was that a lot of potentially suitable candidates had been dethroned by 1945. And/or had been fighting on the other side during two global wars. So a hugely reduced pool of suitable candidates and social attitudes not yet developed enough to permit marriage to a commoner. And needs to be a Protestant or prepared to convert. So probably a British aristocrat or a Danish, Norwegian or Swedish Royal.\n\nProblem the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret had to face was that a lot of potentially suitable candidates had been dethroned by 1945.

That is very good.\n\nOnly one flaw, he's very possibly gay. He is at the least a lifelong bachelor. His brother Max?\n\nHow dare you!\n\nOoh, that is phresh.

Margaret might have a few other partners over the years though, obviously.\n\nThe heir to the British throne or at least a high profile Royal is transgender\n\nAnd much confusion amongst the handful of Jacobites did ensue"
