        "text": "On June 9th, 1921, an extraordinary couple exchanged vows in a church in Copenhagen, creating a wedding that defied convention and captured the attention of the world. This was no ordinary union, and the circumstances surrounding it were far from ordinary. The bride, Her Royal Highness Princess Margrethe of Denmark, was the daughter of Prince Waldemar of Denmark, himself the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark, and Princess Marie of Orléans. The groom, His Royal Highness Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, hailed from a Catholic family, and their wedding took place in the Catholic Sacred Heart of Jesus church, despite the Protestant background of the Danish royal family.\n\nPrincess Margrethe’s upbringing was unique, as she was raised in the Catholic faith despite being a member of the Protestant Danish Royal Family. This was due to her mother’s French royal lineage. When Prince Waldemar and Princess Marie married in 1885, it was decided that their sons would be raised as Protestants, while their daughters would be raised as Catholics. Princess Margrethe happened to be the only daughter born from this Protestant-Catholic union.\n\nBorn in September 1895, Princess Margrethe received the names Margrethe Françoise Louise Marie. Her baptism took place in her parents‘ home two days after her birth, followed by a grander christening ceremony witnessed by family members and public representatives, befitting her status as the granddaughter of the King of Denmark.\n\nTragedy struck at a young age when Princess Margrethe’s mother passed away in 1909, leaving her motherless at the age of 10. Prince René’s background was equally noteworthy, with his father being the Duke of Parma and his mother born an Infanta of Portugal. He came from a large family, with half-siblings and siblings, including the famous last Empress of Austria, Zita. His brother Felix married the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and one of his half-sister Marie-Louise , married Prince Ferdinand I of Bulgaria.\n\nThe announcement of the royal engagement on March 11th came as a surprise to many, including those close to Prince Valdemar’s family. However, there were indications that some preparations had been made prior to the announcement. Prince René, accompanied by his brothers, had arrived the day before to meet with Princess Margrethe’s family. The engagement was celebrated at a birthday reception and luncheon for the Danish Crown Prince, where the rest of the family had the opportunity to meet the groom-to-be. Various private dinners were hosted by Prince Waldemar and the Queen Dowager, providing further opportunities for the families to bond and celebrate the upcoming union.\n\nPre-wedding events continued in the days leading up to the wedding, following the tradition of Royal weddings of that era. Guests arrived, and festivities commenced, including a grand dinner and ball hosted by Prince Waldemar at Bernsdorff Palace. The Royal guests, along with Princess Margrethe’s friends, enjoyed the enchanting evening adorned in elegant attire, captured in a photograph that immortalized the moment.\n\nThe photograph revealed a display of tiaras and jewelry, worn by the distinguished guests. Details regarding the specific events and their tiara usage were scarce due to the private nature of these occasions.\n\nThe wedding day arrived on June 9th, 1921, with preparations taking place at Bernsdorff Palace. The exterior was decorated with greenery, Danish flags, and the initials of the couple, creating a picturesque scene. Inside the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, invited guests, including representatives from official authorities, courtiers, and members of the Danish Catholic community, filled the pews. The church itself was adorned with a tasteful and impactful decoration scheme, featuring palms, ivy, rhododendrons, and hydrangeas.\n\nFloral crosses representing both the Danish and French flags adorned the altar.\n\nThe Royal guests arrived at the church and were received by the Marshal of the Court, Chamberlain W. Rothe, and other dignitaries. The procession, led by the King and Queen, Prince René and his mother the Duchess of Parma, the Queen Dowager, and other Royal family members, made their way down the aisle to their designated seats. The anticipation grew as the moment approached for the bride and her father to make their entrance. Princess Margrethe, radiating joy, walked beside her father, her magnificent lace train held in place by a wreath of myrtle and orange flowers, accentuated by a delicate diamond tiara, a gift from the groom.\n\nFollowing the church ceremony, the Royal family returned to Amalienborg, where a luncheon was hosted in their honor. The guests, who had received invitations, extended their congratulations to the newly weds and enjoyed a sumptuous meal accompanied by music and Danish and French melodies. The grandeur of the occasion was enhanced by the beautifully decorated tables adorned with pink roses and the sparkling crystal used for the dining experience.\n\nOutside the palace, crowds of people had gathered, eagerly awaiting a glimpse of the newly weds. Princess Margrethe and Prince René made a balcony appearance, waving to the enthusiastic crowd, before returning inside to continue the luncheon. The celebrations concluded with the departure of the couple, bidding farewell to their family members, and embarking on their journey together. As they left, well-wishers showered them with rice and flowers, adding to the joyful atmosphere.\n\nThe wedding of Princess Margrethe and Prince René was a remarkable event that captured the imagination of the public. It defied expectations and highlighted the union of two individuals from different backgrounds and faiths. The day was filled with love, joy, and a sense of unity, as the Royal families and their guests came together to celebrate this extraordinary marriage.\n\nmore about the wedding gift and royal jewels of the bride:\n\nPrincess Marguerite of Bourbon-Parma Parma Margaret Princess of Denmark| Fleur de lys in diamonds Royal Wedding Tiara Royal Jewel History\n\nJuwelen des dänischen Königshauses| Princess Marie de Orleans Hochzeit| Prinzessin Waldemar von Dänemark\n\nRoyal Wedding Gifts Princess Marie of Orleans France|Princess of Denmark|Mariage Presents Royal Jewel History\n\nMariage du prince Waldemar de Danemark et la princesse Marie d’Orleans|Royal France\n\nOpal and Diamond Tiara Princess Marie of Orleans|Opal Parure Duchess of Chartres|Royal Jewels Denmark\n\nOpal Choker Diamond Ruby and Sapphire Necklace Princess Marie of Orleans |France |Princess of Denmark|Royal Jewel History\n\nThe danish crown jewels, Frederik IX’s pipe collection and the more than 400-year-old Rosenborg wine are among the many objects that appear in the program series „The Queen’s Treasury“, which from tonight and the next Tuesdays will be broadcast on DR 1.\n\nThe museum collection Kongernes Samling contains Danish kings and queens‘ central objects and works of art, and the program series follows the creation of the exhibitions „A Queen’s Jewelry Box“ and „Mary & the Crown Princesses“, which are currently on display at the Amalienborg Museum and Koldinghus, respectively.\n\nThe exhibitions have been created in collaboration with Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess, and the programs are included when the Queen and the Crown Princess take part in the preparations for the new exhibitions. The first episode of „The Queen’s Treasury“ will be broadcast tonight at 20.30 on DR1.https://www.dr.dk/drtv/se/dronningens-skatkammer_-smykker-der-taler_307886\n\nCrown jewels and fideikomis jewels\n\nAt special events such as state visits, the New Year’s table and other major events where a gala is worn, the female members of the royal family like to wear historical jewellery. Often as sets, also called garnishes, with a tiara and earrings, necklace and possibly bracelet. The jewelery is partly the crown jewels, partly jewellery, owned by the Danish Royal House’s Løsørefideikommis and jewelery privately owned by the Royal House.\n\nThe crown jewels\n\nThe best-known pieces of jewelery are the crown jewels, which primarily consist of four large jewellery sets: a brilliant set, an emerald set, a pearl-ruby set and a rose stone set. The crown jewels belong to the Crown, i.e. the monarch and his queen. After the change of throne, they are therefore available to HM Queen Mary. When the crown jewels are not in use, they are displayed in the treasury in the secured basement under Rosenborg Castle.\n\nIt is customary for the crown jewels to remain in Denmark, which means that they are not taken with them when visiting abroad. The Danish crown jewels are the only ones in the world that are both exhibited as museum objects and at the same time worn by the country’s queen.\n\nThe history of the crown jewels goes back to Christian VI’s queen, Queen Sophie Magdalene, who in her will from 1746 decided that her jewelery should not pass to one specific person, but always be available to the country’s sitting queen on the grounds that „there in this royal house there are so few jewels and no crown jewels at all“. Most of Queen Sophie Magdalene’s original jewelery has been remade by subsequent queens as jewelery fashions have changed. Today, the four crown jewel sets have the design that Christian VIII’s queen, Queen Caroline Amalie, gave them in 1840.\n\nThe jewelery in the Danish Royal House’s Loose Trust Committee\n\nAnother group of striking jewelery is the jewelery from the Danish Royal House’s Loose Trust Committee. These pieces include, among others, the Perlepoire set of tiara, necklace, earrings and brooches, the large diamond necklace, called the Rivière , and the diamond frame with royal portrait worn by the Queen at the gala.\n\nThe Royal Trust Trust was founded by Frederik 8th and Queen Lovisa in 1910. The purpose was to collect and secure gold, silver and other valuables „that are desired to be preserved in Our Family and therefore must pass undivided from King to King of our House“.\n\nThe objects in a fideicommis are inherited in the family. They are not owned by the individual person, and a sale or mortgaging of the inheritance is therefore not possible. In the Royal Trust Committee, this means that important collections – not least the co-founder, Queen Lovisa’s great legacy from her Dutch, German, French and Swedish ancestors – have been able to be kept together in the Royal House.\n\nThe Commission of Estates jewelery is worn by the sitting Queen and can be taken abroad for use at gala events.\n\nThe royal family’s private jewelery\n\nThe queen and the other women in the royal family also have a collection of private jewels which they themselves dispose of.\n\nIn Queen Margrethe’s collection, you will find, among other things, the palmette tiara and the sapphire set with necklace and earrings, which Frederik IX had made as a wedding present for his daughter, the successor to the throne, Princess Margrethe. Other important pieces of jewelery are the ruby ​​and pearl set, which was a silver wedding gift from Prince Henrik, and the Greenlandic gold diadem, the flower diadem Naasut – a gift from Greenland in connection with the 40th anniversary of the government in 2012.\n\nIn the future Queen Mary’s jewelry collection, you will find the old Russian turquoise and brilliant jewelry that Queen Margrethe gave to her daughter-in-law on her 50th birthday in 2022, and a slender diamond tiara that can also be used as a necklace, and which the future queen herself has purchased at auction.\n\nThe most well-known of the privately owned pieces of jewelery worn by the future queen is probably the ruby ​​set, given to the future king by her maternal grandmother Queen Ingrid. The set was made for French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte’s wife Desirée and was worn at Emperor Napoleon’s coronation in 1804. The set came to Sweden via the Bernadotte couple when they were appointed Crown Prince Couple of Sweden. Desirée, who in 1818 became Queen Desideria of Sweden, then let it go to her daughter-in-law Josefina. As queen dowager, in 1869 Josefina presented the set to her granddaughter, Princess Lovisa, at her wedding to Danish Crown Prince Frederik (8th) with the reason „the Danish colors for Louisa“.\n\nCrown princess Mary – Jewels|Royal Denmark| Diamond Wedding Tiara\n\nDie Kronjuwelen des dänischen Königshauses Königin Caroline Amalie | Diamanten und Schmuck\n\nThe Crownjewels Denmark | Diamands Queen Caroline Amalie |Royal Jewels\n\nDanish Crown Jewels – Emeralds | Emerald Parure Tiara Necklace Earrings Brooch| Denmark Royal Jewelry\n\nSmaragd Garnitur von Königin Caroline Amalie| Queen of Denmark Emerald Parure, Emerald Tiara, Emerald Stomacher, Emerald Brooch Emerald Necklace\n\nDänische Kronjuwelen mit Smaragden | Königin von Dänemark\n\nRoyal Wedding Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Imperial Marriage Jewels |Sapphire Diamond Necklace Choker Tiara Present of the Czar and Czarina\n\nRoyale Hochzeit Herzogin Alexandrine von Mecklenburg-Schwerin | Juwelen des dänischen Königshauses\n\nDie Brautgeschenke an die spätere Königin Alexandrine von Dänemark| Dänisches Königshaus\n\nPearl and Diamond Pendant and Pearl pendants Queen Louisa |Bolin|Royal Jewels Denmark"
