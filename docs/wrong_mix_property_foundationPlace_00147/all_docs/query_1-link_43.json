Though many of the perpetrators do not profess Christianity, antisemitism has flourished in Christian Europe. The charge of deicide has shaped the Christian conception of Jews and marked them as the Other. History has shown that, for Christians, no charge was too outrageous to levy upon Jews. Nowhere was this more clearly expressed than in Nazi Germany, its allied European states, and occupied territories. Compounded by racial science, Christian antisemitism, never benign, turned lethal and led to the near eradication of Europe’s Jews. Postwar reactions against the Nazi crimes may have made antisemitism much less socially and politically acceptable, but it hardly disappeared. In this book, thirteen scholars of European history, Jewish studies, and Christian theology examine antisemitism’s insidious role in Europe’s intellectual and political life. The essays reveal that annihilative antisemitic thought was not limited to Germany, but could be found in the theology and liturgical practice of most of Europe’s Christian churches. They dismantle the claim of a distinction between Christian anti-Judaism and neopagan antisemitism and show that, at the heart of Christianity, hatred for Jews overwhelmingly formed the milieu of twentieth-century Europe.

Spicer\n\nThe scholars whose essays appear in this volume met at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in the summer of 2004 for a workshop about the Holocaust and antisemitism in Christian Europe. Our goal was to examine how the legacy of antisemitism within the Christian churches limited the ability of their clergy and laity to critique National Socialism as evil and unequivocally condemn it. The Center’s workshops provide a unique experience for researchers to gather together outside the conﬁnes of their regular college or university milieu and to devote two weeks solely to examining a shared interest. Before the workshop began, each participant prepared an original essay based on primary source material, which we shared with one another. Over the course of the two weeks, we devoted approximately two and a half hours to in-depth discussion of the content of each paper. At the end of our time together, each of us agreed to revise his or her paper for publication. The essays in this volume are the product of this introspective process. The contributors to this volume agree that the study of the historical and theological basis for antisemitism remains paramount today, as the recent controversy over Mel Gibson’s ﬁlm The Passion of the Christ made clear.1 It is the responsibility of contemporary scholarship to inform present and future generations of students, scholars, and the broader population about antisemitism’s subtleties and intrinsic evils. Through their research, responsible historians and theologians encourage the Christian churches to continue to observe carefully the roles that antisemitism has played and continues to play in their history, theology, and liturgical worship. Although an ever-growing body of literature deals with the study of antisemitism, scholars of Christian and Jewish studies have, until recently, kept a strict but misleading separation between Nazi ‘‘racial antisemitism’’ and ‘‘Christian antisemitism.’’2\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nMore than twenty years ago, Ulrich von Hehl, an historian of German Catholicism, publicly lamented that historians and theologians had not worked together to study how the churches had responded to National Socialism. Hehl argued that it was very di≈cult for younger historians to interpret authentically the experience of the Christian churches under National Socialism because of their lack of ‘‘lived understanding.’’ He also criticized the perceived need on the part of younger historians to pass judgment upon Christianity without an essential understanding of the theology of this period.3 Since the early 1980s, historians and theologians have made increasing and earnest e√orts to address antisemitism in the churches. Normally, these discussions have taken place in individual sessions at conferences dedicated to the study of the Holocaust in general or, alternatively, in conferences dedicated to the study of the 1933–1945 German Kirchenkampf (church struggle). Few, if any, conferences have speciﬁcally brought together historians and theologians to discuss antisemitism.4 Consequently, our workshop sought to address this void by gathering scholars of German, Danish, Polish, and Romanian history alongside scholars of Judaism and Christianity. Our goal was to examine speciﬁcally the role antisemitism played in the Christian response to National Socialism. The contributions in this volume reference the familial relations between Jews and Christians and the matter of cruciﬁxion and the Jews in the New Testament period itself; interwar Polish and German Christian theology and the civil struggle in Spain; German-Christian theological views and their application through the war; wartime Christian and antisemitic attitudes in Romania and Denmark; and postwar Christian theological developments in occupied Germany and in the Holy See. Though these essays raise a multitude of issues, one in particular stands out: the Christian failure to understand and acknowledge Judaism on its own terms. Ever since Jesus of Nazareth walked this earth, his followers have professed to live his teaching of love of neighbor. Unfortunately, Christians have often failed to embrace the fullness of this teaching.5 This was especially true under National Socialism. Nevertheless, some Christians were open to providing caritas, or charity, to Jews in need. Still, these acts of kindness did not mean that individual Christians truly viewed Jews as equals or fully acknowledged their religious and cultural heritage as legitimate. For Christians, there was still the desire, or even the command, to proselytize and bring Jews ‘‘into the fold.’’ Unfortunately, similar initiatives today persist in most Christian denominations. In addition, few Christian denominations, if any, have fully recognized\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nthe salviﬁc nature of the original and everlasting covenant made between Abraham and Yahweh. Though the churches have advanced substantially in their understanding of their relationship to Jews and Judaism, there is still a long way to go. Declarations such as Dominus Iesus from the Holy See’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which fail to acknowledge this unique relationship, only perpetuate the teaching of a triumphant Christianity.6 In turn, Judaism is then easily relegated to second-place status beneath Christianity, thereby creating an atmosphere for antisemitism to thrive. For antisemitism is still quite present in Christianity: in its Scripture, in its worship, and in its everyday rhetoric. We hope that the essays in this volume serve to raise the reader’s awareness of Christianity’s role in the propagation and spread of antisemitism. So many individuals contributed to the success of our workshop and of this volume. In particular, in the name of all the contributors, I would like to o√er special words of gratitude to Paul A. Shapiro, Director of the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum; Robert Ehrenreich, Director of University Programs for the Center; Benton Arnovitz, Director of Academic Publications for the Center; Ann Millin, special assistant to the Center’s director; Suzanne Brown-Fleming, senior program o≈cer for the Center’s University Programs; Aleisa Fishman, editorial coordinator for the Center’s Academic Publications; Martin Dean, an applied research scholar of the Center; and Eric Brinkert, a Center intern; all of whom contributed their many talents and gifts to make our time at the museum enjoyable and extremely productive. The original workshop was also made possible by the generosity of the Cannon Hottberger Fund. I completed the editing of this volume while a fellow of the Center. During this time, my colleagues there were extremely generous with their time and insights. In particular, I would like to thank Victoria Barnett, Diana Dimitru, Judith Gerson, Daniel Magilow, Jürgen Matthäus, Lisa Yavnai, and Lisa Zaid. In addition, I would like to express my appreciation to the administration of Stonehill College, especially Mark Cregan, C.S.C., Esq., President; Katie Conboy, Vice-President for Academic A√airs; Karen Talentino, Dean of Faculty; and Nancy Dunsing, Assistant to the Vice-President for Academic A√airs, for their continued support of my research and writing. Last, but never least, I would like to acknowledge especially my confreres in the Eastern Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross and my parents, John and Gloria Spicer, whose concern and support strengthen me in my ministry and academic endeavors.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nNOTES 1.

John T. Pawlikowski and Kevin P. Spicer\n\nFor many years, Father Heinrich Weber labored as the Caritas (Catholic Charities) director in the diocese of Münster. His coworkers remember him as a kind, gentle man, who had great compassion for the poor and oppressed. In 1935, the University of Breslau o√ered him an opportunity to share his wealth of pastoral experience with seminarians from Berlin and Breslau by becoming a professor of pastoral theology.1 Weber happily accepted this opportunity, especially the chance to inﬂuence the ministerial approach of these future priests. At the same time, Weber realized that the German government under National Socialism would provide him with great challenges in his attempt to teach students about Christian compassion and charity in ministry. Similarly, Weber also knew that he had Father Felix Haase, a member of the Nazi Party and dean of the Faculty of Theology at the university, constantly watching to ensure that he did not teach anything contrary to the spirit of the new German state.2 Therefore, he reﬁned the way he presented the traditional Christian commands to love God and neighbor. In 1938, Weber published his lectures on this subject as The Essence of Charity. According to Weber, ‘‘every person, even foreigners, indeed even enemies of the Volk3 fall under the concept of neighbor.’’ He referred his readers to the parable of the Good Samaritan as an example of this teaching.4 Weber further explained that ‘‘our neighbors include not only blood relations or friends, but every person who su√ers, whether a Samaritan or a pagan or a Jew. The command of Christ to love neighbor’’ superseded ‘‘all personal, societal, national, and religious barriers’’ and required that one must be willing to sacriﬁce one’s own bodily well-being for the salvation of one’s neighbor.5 However, Weber tempered this bold statement by emphasizing that a Catholic should ‘‘never place his own salvation in jeopardy in order to love neighbor.’’6 Instead of discussing how concretely to show one’s love for a neighbor, Weber continued to qualify his interpretation by making distinctions in the deﬁnition of who\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nis neighbor. Weber stated that though each person was our neighbor, ‘‘not everyone’’ was our ‘‘neighbor to the same degree.’’7 He argued that ‘‘the union of blood, of family, of tribal identity and of membership in a race, the union of a household, the union of the same homeland and of friendship, the union of the same faith and the same culture’’ established and gave rise ‘‘to narrower and closer partnerships.’’8 In his interpretation of Christ’s command to love neighbor, Weber made concessions and stated preferences as to whom should primarily beneﬁt from the teaching. One can almost see Professor Weber at a chalkboard drawing circles around circles to di√erentiate between the ‘‘degrees’’ of neighbor. In contrast, when one turns to the biblical text, the commandment is clear and void of any preferentialism: ‘‘One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he [Jesus] answered them well, he asked him, ‘Which commandment is the ﬁrst of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The ﬁrst is, ‘Hear O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these’’’ (Mk 12:28– 31).9 In the Gospel of John, Jesus goes even further when he teaches his disciples: ‘‘This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you’’ (Jn 15:12–14). Unfortunately, all too often in history, Christians have chosen to ignore these great commandments or to interpret them according to their own worldview. The history of Jewish-Christian encounters over the centuries is no exception. This history is ﬁlled with lies, hatred, persecution, violence, and murder. While there were always Christians willing to reach out to Jews by o√ering charity in the form of material goods when the dominant Christian society restricted, oppressed, and persecuted them, seldom would the same Christians embrace the fullness of Jesus’ commandments and place themselves in complete solidarity with Jews to the point of risking their own lives. Under National Socialism, Christians did not change this pattern of behavior. There are many factors that account for why more Christians did not resist the persecution and murder of European Jews during the Holocaust. It is not possible here to review all of these complex factors. In addition, many responses had nothing to do with religion or hatred of Jews, but instead centered around questions of self-preservation\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nand fear of reprisal. Many Christians who lived under National Socialism have admitted in interviews that they simply were not ready to spend torturous years in prison or even become martyrs in order to help Jews. Nevertheless, behind the operating mindset of Europe’s Christians, whether articulated or not, existed centuries of o≈cial teaching of the Christian churches, which portrayed Jews as the Other. This mindset identiﬁed Jews as the people who rejected Christ and cruciﬁed him. The Gospels, especially John, recorded and proclaimed this image. Through their sermons and writings, the early Church Fathers reinforced this teaching. And this teaching stuck and became an accepted fact for the Christian churches. As a German Catholic woman who lived through Hitler’s Germany testiﬁed, it was not necessary for her religion teachers even to emphasize the deicide charge, because it was something that every Catholic knew and believed to be true.10 To assess how Christianity responded to the question of loving neighbor in 1920s–1940s Europe, the authors in this collection examine the churches from the perspective of both the leadership (local, national, and universal level) and the laity in four areas: Christian theology, clerical pastoral practice, Jewish-Catholic dialogue, and popular perceptions Jews and Christians share of one another. In the section exploring ‘‘Theological Antisemitism,’’ Thorsten Wagner, Anna ©ysiak, Robert Krieg, and Donald Dietrich reveal the ties between historical anti-Judaism and modern antisemitism within the theology of Europe’s Lutheran and Catholic churches. These authors recognize that the churches often made distinctions between Christian anti-Judaism and racial antisemitism. Commonly, the churches viewed anti-Judaism as religiously and theologically driven and stemming from the Christian belief that Christianity has superseded Judaism and made it a fossilized relic. At times, the churches also generally acknowledged that anti-Judaism has led to teaching contempt for Jews and to violence against them because of their so-called stubborn rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. In turn, they welcomed Jews who converted into the Christian community. In contrast, the churches understood antisemitism as a condemnation of Jews because of their ‘‘inferior’’ race and tied this to the development of nineteenth-century racial science. Despite these distinctions, at the root of hatred of Jews in all its various forms was the initial Christian portrayal of Jews as the Other who cruciﬁed Christ. Christians reinforced this notion by easily turning to Scripture and reading, ‘‘Then the people [Jews] as a whole answered, ‘His blood be on us and on our children!’’’ (Mt 27:25). Therefore, in their contributions, Wagner, ©ysiak,\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nKrieg, and Dietrich reveal the integral connection between anti-Judaism and antisemitism in the theology of the Lutheran and Catholic churches. Speciﬁcally, in his essay, Thorsten Wagner probes the actions of the Lutheran Church in Denmark beyond the generalizations about the heroic posture of the Danes. While in no way wishing to undermine the recognition Denmark truly deserves for its rescue e√orts on behalf of its Jewish community, Wagner shows the actual story to be considerably more complex than the prevailing image of Denmark during World War II, especially in reference to the predominant Lutheran Church. Wagner o√ers a comprehensive analysis of how the majority Lutheran population in Denmark viewed Jews and Judaism. He ﬁnds that their outlook was not entirely positive and, in fact, not all that di√erent from stereotypes of Jews and Judaism prevalent among the peoples of other European countries at the time. In addition, Danish Lutheranism never halted its campaign to missionize Jews. Fundamentally, Danish Lutheranism exhibited considerable contempt for Judaism as a religion, whether in its ancient forms or in its more modern guise. Judaism was dubbed a ridiculous and pitiful legalism, and Danish theologians and pastors spoke out strongly against what they regarded as perverse Jewish support for modern liberalism and capitalism. According to Wagner, the classic antiJewish stereotypes were clearly present within the Danish Lutheran community. Then why, Wagner correctly asks, did classical Christian antiJudaism in Denmark not translate into church support for Nazi racial antisemitism as it did in so many other European countries? Wagner believes the answer lies in the emergence of a challenge to the Danish nation as to whether it would collaborate or resist. It chose the latter and thus rescue of Danish Jews became an immediate imperative. Anna ©ysiak builds upon similar theological themes in her essay on Catholic theologians’ perceptions of Jews in prewar Poland. ©ysiak persuasively establishes a signiﬁcant link between Catholic leaders’ concepts about Jews and Judaism and their views of the Church’s missionary nature that obliged it to pursue the conversion of Jews. She shows how even those scholars considered experts on Judaism, such as Stanis™aw Trzeciak and Jozef Kruszynski, ´ debased Judaism, particularly in its modern forms. ©ysiak also reveals that there were other voices in the Polish Catholic Church that sought a reevaluation of the Church’s relationship with Judaism. In Warsaw and several other dioceses in Poland, Catholics founded chapters of the Amici Israel (Friends of Israel) organization. Cardinal Kakowski and several other bishops supported these endeavors. Amici Israel published a bulletin, Pax Super Israel. That bulletin cham-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\npioned the overall goals of the organization in Poland, such as the cessation of the deicide accusation against Jews, the removal of negative terms about Jews in the Christian liturgy, and the elimination of all antisemitic language in general. Prior to the Second World War, this certainly represented a promising movement in Poland. Regrettably, in March 1928, the Vatican’s Congregation of the Holy O≈ce decreed the dissolution of the organization throughout Europe on the grounds that its perspectives were not in keeping with the spirit of the Church, the teachings of the Church Fathers, and the Catholic liturgy. Likewise, in their articles, Robert Krieg and Donald Dietrich show how the views of prominent Christian theologians a√ected Christian consciousness in Germany prior to and during the period of the Third Reich. In turn, they establish an unquestionable link between Nazism and Christian descriptions of Jews and Judaism over the centuries. There is little doubt that those negative descriptions provided a fertile seedbed for Christian acquiescence to and even outright endorsement of Nazi ideology, on both the popular and scholarly levels and within all the major branches of Christianity. Their combined research demonstrates a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on Catholic self-identity during this critical period in German history. While neither would argue that such theological perspectives were the sole inﬂuence on Catholic behavior at the time, their work deﬁnitely establishes that such theological views had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on Catholic reaction to the Nazi onslaught against Jews. In so doing, they help to undercut any thesis that Nazi antisemitism was exclusively a neo-pagan phenomenon; rather, it also found its roots in theological anti-Judaism and antisemitism. With the theological connection between Christian anti-Judaism and antisemitism established, the next section, ‘‘Christian Clergy and the Extreme Right Wing,’’ shows how some members of the Catholic and Orthodox clergy embraced this theological antisemitism and made it a concrete part of their pastoral ministry and ecclesiastical outlook. In his piece, Kevin Spicer reveals how Father Dr. Phillip Haeuser embraced the most negative elements of his Church’s anti-Jewish teaching, coupled them with modern antisemitism, and used this to agitate for National Socialism. This essay continues his work on ‘‘brown priests’’—Catholic clergymen who publicly embraced National Socialism. While they were much smaller a number than the ‘‘German Christian’’ pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the brown priests’ lives and choices, along with their interaction with their Church superiors, o√er a unique and unﬂattering portrait of Church acceptance of antisemitism. In turn, the\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\npreaching and writings of the brown priests show how they translated traditional Christian hostility for Jews into overt support for Nazism. Spicer also reveals that the brown priests encountered opposition from German Catholic bishops. Yet the bishops regularly centered on a priest’s failure to obey episcopal commands, rather than on his antisemitism. Similarly, in her contribution on the Spanish Civil War and the German Catholic hierarchy, Beth A. Griech-Polelle reveals how the bishops’ myopic social vision enabled them to share goals similar to those of National Socialism. Reminiscent of the domino theory with regard to Vietnam in the sixties, a strong belief among European Catholics held that if Spain fell to the communists, the rest of western Europe might follow. Many feared this would end Catholicism’s inﬂuence in Europe. Certainly, Spanish communists did not treat Catholic leaders and Catholic institutions in Spain well. The Catholic leadership’s stance during the Spanish Civil War galvanized Catholic attitudes in both Europe and America and, in turn, strengthened support for fascist alternatives, including the Nazi version of fascism, among Catholics. Since antisemitic rhetoric portrayed Jews as supporters of communism, this only added to anti-Jewish sentiment. As a result and in reaction to the communist e√ort to take over Catholic Spain, Catholics increasingly supported the cause of the extreme right. Support of the extreme right was not limited to Catholics alone. In his analysis of the causal relationship between Romanian antisemitism and the teachings of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Paul Shapiro unmasks the practical aspects of this linkage by examining the active involvement of churchmen in the notorious Iron Guard. The spiritual mentors for the Iron Guard included prominent Orthodox religious scholars such as Mircea Eliade, who after ﬂeeing the country taught at the University of Chicago. Shapiro’s chapter also addresses Orthodox Christianity’s role in the Holocaust, an under-researched area in comparison to the role of Protestantism and Catholicism during this time frame. In the next section, ‘‘Postwar Jewish-Christian Encounters,’’ Matthew Hockenos and Elias Füllenbach examine how the Christian churches attempted to reinterpret their relationship with Jews after the Holocaust. Their articles show that the reality of the Holocaust forced Christians to see Jews as their neighbors. Both Hockenos and Füllenbach demonstrate that there was clearly ecclesiastical pressure placed upon individuals such as Gertrud Luckner to desist in their e√orts to generate a wholesale review of Christian attitudes toward Jews and Judaism in light of the\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nHolocaust. As Hockenos writes in his essay on the proselytization of Jews in postwar Germany, ‘‘recognition by Protestant clergymen of the need for a fundamental transformation of the Church’s relationship to Jews and its understanding of Judaism was slow and halting.’’ Nevertheless, Füllenbach shows that while there is certainly more than adequate room for criticism of the churches as institutions and individuals, the picture is not totally slanted toward the negative. In this immediate postwar era, individuals planted seeds that would mature in the 1960s within the churches in the form of o≈cial statements that spoke of Jews and Judaism in a positive light, the most inﬂuential of them being chapter four of the Second Vatican Council’s Declaration on Non-Christian Religions (Nostra Aetate). Nevertheless, one must recognize that there is still much to do before the churches can fully free themselves of antisemitism. Finally, in the section ‘‘Viewing Each Other,’’ Gershon Greenberg, Suzanne Brown-Fleming, and Richard Steigmann-Gall show how far both Christians and Jews still need to journey in order to embrace each other authentically as neighbor. In his essay, Gershon Greenberg examines how Orthodox Jews responded to the Holocaust theologically. He ﬁnds not one single understanding, but rather two major trends. The unitive held that Christianity shared Judaism’s God, morality, and Scripture. The unitive concept also maintained that Christianity was compromised by a latent paganism and consequently had the potential for an extreme hatred of Jews. Thus for Jewish religious thinkers such as Yehuydah Layb Gerst of ©ód´z, Poland, Christianity’s involvement with Nazism was a matter of paganism’s cooption of the Christian religion. A more dominant view within the orthodox Jewish community, which Greenberg labels as dualistic, viewed Christianity as profane and in opposition to the sacred reality of Jews. In this dualism, Christianity represented the profane and Judaism the sacred. In her piece, Suzanne Brown-Fleming extends Greenberg’s analysis by studying the experience of Rabbi Philip Bernstein, an advisor on Jewish a√airs to General Joseph T. McNarney of the United States occupation forces. Brown-Fleming reveals how very di√erent Bernstein’s observations on postwar Germany and the treatment of war criminals were from those of Catholic counterpart Cardinal Aloisius Muench, who cared for Catholic displaced persons. These two radically di√erent observations portray the profound gap between the Jewish and the Christian experiences under National Socialism. These di√erent experiences also shed light on the di√erence between their views on postwar Germany. In conclusion, Richard Steigmann-Gall shows the distance that the\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nchurches must overcome before truly comprehending the depth of antisemitism still present within their traditions. As a concrete example, he speaks of Rabbi A. James Rudin’s refusal to add his name to the important September 2000 Jewish document on Christianity, Dabru Emet, despite his central decades-long role in promoting enhanced JewishChristian understanding. Rudin objected to the ﬁrst sentence of point ﬁve of the document, which read, ‘‘Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon.’’11 While the subsequent sentence does connect Nazism with traditional Christian support of antisemitism, the ﬁrst sentence’s apparent endorsement of the interpretation of Nazism as essentially a pagan philosophy opposed to all forms of religion concerned Rudin. His objection has raised an important issue. There is a disturbing tendency in some Christian circles to label Nazism equally anti-Christian and antiJewish. Certainly, Nazism was fundamentally anti-Christian and did attack the churches; however, it was also clearly willing to use the support of Christians who accepted its ideology. One must resist such a simple equation of Nazism’s opposition to both Judaism and Christianity. They were not fully analogous in the minds of the Nazis. To equate them as such often hides a desire to mitigate Christianity’s responsibility for the Holocaust. Unfortunately, this approach was visible in Pope Benedict XVI’s remarks during his August 2005 visit to a synagogue in Cologne. While one may not fault him for calling Nazism ‘‘neo-pagan,’’ this assertion must be accompanied by deﬁnite mention of Christian complicity. In recent years, Catholic bishops in France and Germany have made such an acknowledgement in statements on the Church and the Holocaust. Even the 1988 Vatican statement on the Holocaust, We Remember, which carried the personal endorsement of Pope John Paul II, made some references to this fact.12 Steigmann-Gall also shows that many convinced Nazis saw nothing incompatible between National Socialism and Christianity. He o√ers substantial evidence of Christian inﬂuence in the writings and speeches of National Socialists. In light of this evidence, Steigmann-Gall forces Christians to reevaluate their tradition’s Scripture and doctrine to see what was and continues to remain present within it that enabled followers of Adolf Hitler to ﬁnd a connection between Christianity and National Socialism. Recent events, particularly in Europe, have shown the continuing persistence of antisemitism. If we are to combat its inﬂuence we must understand its previous developments. Similarly, Christians of every denomination must learn to embrace the fullness of Christ’s greatest commandments to love God and to love neighbor. The essays in this\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nvolume bring to the fore dimensions of the failure to put this teaching into practice. Similarly, they detail antisemitism’s rise and impact within the religious community at a critical moment in human history. Understanding antisemitism’s previous emergence within the Christian churches provides invaluable insights on how we today might resist this ugly reality.\n\nNOTES 1.

Compared to most other countries, the Danish-Jewish experience seems to stand out as a remarkable exception in modern European history. Obviously, this perception is intrinsically linked to the unique rescue e√ort of the Danish people in October 1943, causing Nazi Germany’s attempt at rounding up and arresting Danish Jews to fail: only a few hundred Jews ended up being deported to Theresienstadt, and even of these, only about ﬁfty—less than 1 percent of the more than seven thousand Jews living in Denmark at the time—perished. One may date the origins of the positive image of Danish-Jewish relations back to the seventeenth century, when Glikl von Hameln, a merchant woman from Hamburg-Altona, praised the Danish king as just, pious, and extraordinarily benevolent toward Jews.1 The only dissertation on Danish-Jewish history published so far, Nathan Bamberger’s Viking Jews, traced this presumably exceptional phenomenon throughout Modern Danish history and concluded: ‘‘In the admirable history of Danish Jewry, one cannot overlook the Danes’ strong humanistic values, their sense of decency, and their care for all citizens.’’2 Organizations such as ‘‘Thanks to Scandinavia’’ promote the Danish commitment to human dignity and ethical values in World War II as a role model for moral behavior today by stating: ‘‘The selﬂess and heroic e√ort of the Scandinavian people through the dark days of Nazi Terror is a shining example of humanity and hope for now and tomorrow.’’3 In addition,\n\n4\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nbooks such as Moral Courage under Stress and The Test of a Democracy attest to this gloriﬁcation of the Danish past in a Jewish perspective.4 Over the last two decades, in the collective memory of American Jews, Denmark has become the antithesis of a Nazi-dominated Europe bogged down by the collaborators’ active complicacy and the bystanders’ indi√erence. Despite this dominating perception of Denmark as a Righteous Nation—even honored as such by Yad Vashem—recent political developments suggest that it may be necessary to take a closer look at these positive portraits of Danish-Jewish relations. In 1999, the nationalistconservative publishing house Tidehverv, run by Jesper Langballe and Søren Krarup, right-wing theologians and clerics, republished Martin Luther’s On the Jews and Their Lies. Langballe and Krarup are also both highly inﬂuential members of parliament for the Danish People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti), a populist radical right-wing party that constitutes the parliamentary basis of the present center-right government. In the introduction, the editors stress the work’s ‘‘contemporary relevance’’ in a≈rmative terms without any critical commentary, while employing anti-Jewish traditions to legitimize their xenophobic populist agenda. In light of the enduring positive image of Danish-Jewish history, this republication—and even more the fact that it did not provoke any academic protest, let alone public outcry—indicates that this perception deserves more scrutiny. Recently, however, a series of newspaper articles that focused on Krarup and his anti-Jewish rhetoric sparked public criticism of these tendencies. Repeatedly, Krarup has attempted to exculpate Harald Nielsen, a writer who welcomed Nazi antisemitic legislation and favored the introduction of the Jewish star. Krarup has also sympathized with Nielsen’s attack on the Danish-Jewish literary scholar Georg Brandes by stating, ‘‘Because of his Jewish blood he felt no reverence towards or intimate connection with the country’s past.’’5 Krarup reacted to allegations of antisemitism by emphasizing his rejection of racism and racial antisemitism as ideologies incommensurate with a Christian worldview. He also emphasized that his family had fought in the nationalconservative resistance against the Nazi occupiers in Denmark. Through his reference to Christian convictions and nationalist orientations, Krarup positioned himself in line with key dimensions of Danish memory culture. To many observers, the most salient event in the history of the Jews of Denmark was their successful attempt to escape the Nazi roundup action of October 1943. As hundreds of non-Jewish Danes assisted them, this rescue operation over the Øresund added to the triumphalist narra-\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n5\n\ntive of successful integration that dominates the perception of DanishJewish history. This narrative, augmented by the sense of gratitude displayed by many Danish Jews for the rejection of antisemitism, has helped to view Danish Jews as the exceptional case of the European-Jewish experience. Danish Lutheran clergy played a key role in these rescue activities. Pastors warned Jews of the imminent danger of deportation, o√ered them hiding places, and facilitated their escape to Sweden. The pastor of Trinitatis Church in central Copenhagen even received the Torah scrolls from the nearby synagogue in Krystalgade and hid them in a secret chamber in his church. Even more explicit was the protest pastoral letter initiated by the bishop of Copenhagen, Hans Fuglsang-Damgaard, and signed on September 29, 1943, by all the Danish Lutheran Church bishops. It was an immediate reaction against the roundup of Danish Jews. On the following Sunday, October 3, 1943, Lutheran pastors throughout Denmark read the letter. Repeatedly, reports told of congregants rising from their pews to express their solidarity and support. The pastoral letter boldly stated that was the duty of the Lutheran Church to protest against the persecution of Jews because of Jesus’ own Jewish heritage and his command to love your neighbor. The letter also added an additional reason for protest: Because [the persecution of Jews] conﬂict[s] with the understanding of justice rooted in the Danish people and settled through centuries in our Danish Christian culture. Accordingly, it is stated in our constitution that all Danish citizens have an equal right and responsibility towards the law, and they have freedom of religion, and a right to worship God in accordance with their vocation and conscience and so that race or religion can never in itself become the cause of deprivation of anybody’s rights, freedom, or property. Irrespective of diverging religious opinions we shall ﬁght for the right of our Jewish brothers and sisters to keep the freedom that we ourselves value more highly than life. The leaders of the Danish Church have a clear understanding of our duty to be law-abiding citizens that do not unreasonably oppose those who execute authority over us, but at the same time we are in our conscience bound to uphold justice and protest against any violation; consequently we shall, if occasion should arise, plainly acknowledge our obligation to obey God more than man.\n\nThis unequivocal declaration of solidarity with Denmark’s Jews seems to conﬁrm the exceptional status of Danish-Jewish relations. Nevertheless, the case of Krarup alerts us to the fact that the picture is more\n\n6\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\ncomplex than this episcopal statement indicates. The work of Benjamin Balslev o√ers a starting point for an investigation of these ambiguities of Christian and clerical thinking about Jews.\n\nThe Ambiguities of the Christian Danish Perspective on Jews and Judaism Benjamin Balslev was pastor at the parish of Soderup, an activist of Mission to Israel (Israelsmissionen), an organization committed to converting Jews, and the author of one of the early popular works on the history of Danish Jewry, The History of Danish Jews, published in 1932 in Copenhagen. In 1934, Balslev published an article on the ‘‘Race-Struggle in Germany’’ in the theological journal Nordisk Missions-Tidsskrift. Also published separately in the same year, this publication to some degree justiﬁed the persecution of Jews. Reports of a Nazi rule of terror did not dissuade Balslev in his beliefs that he developed over the previous two decades. Rather, he argued that there was merely a struggle going on between two peoples: Germans and Jews. Jews, he wrote, had an enormous and destructive inﬂuence both morally and economically in Germany. Furthermore, Jews constituted the bulk of an ethnically indigestible anti-Germanism that the Nazis fought to neutralize: ‘‘Germany has taken notice of its Jews and its Jewish question to a degree which is unknown to us. . . . While countries such as England and, we could add, Denmark always have had a homogeneous population, Germany has internally su√ered from an anti-Germanism, something ethnically indigestible, and among these ranks, Germany’s Jews were disproportionally well represented.’’6 Such thinking led Balslev to argue that the burning of allegedly morally detrimental books was a meaningful act of self-defense. While Balslev purported to have the main objective to refute racist antisemitism and to reject racial theories and generalizing accusations against all German Jews, he still presented the ongoing disenfranchisement and persecution of Jews as the battle between two peoples. In Balslev’s twisted worldview, one should refute racial antisemitism because it deﬁed conversion, God’s solution to the Jewish question. Nevertheless, he held that antisemitic perceptions, attitudes, and practices were legitimate since they constituted Germans’ defense against the detrimental inﬂuence of Jews on the economy and culture. His argument would then hold true for Denmark if its population were not homogeneous and if its Jewish community were less assimilated and more signif-\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n7\n\nicant in terms of size and inﬂuence. Balslev’s point of view implied that, under these circumstances, such a reaction would be meaningful and necessary. Thus, the dream of an ethnically and culturally homogeneous nation proved to be the crucial pitfall of both Danish history and present politics.\n\nSources and Historiography In order to understand the historical underpinnings of Danish Lutheran clergy’s attitudes toward Jews, one must examine the history of Danish-Jewish relations. In turn, this will provide a basis for an analysis of the dream of a homogeneous nation as it played itself out in the context of Danish clerical discourses and practices from 1918 to 1945. The discussion of these problems is, in contrast to the case of Norway,7 hampered by the still sizeable lacunae of research in this ﬁeld. This is even more true in regard to the period’s church history. Recent publications are of limited use since they idealize the rejection of antisemitism in regard to clerical attitudes toward Jews.8 Here, my focus will not be on individual theologians or speciﬁc organizations, but rather on the ‘‘public sphere’’ of the church in its declarations, pastoral letters, protests, and written works. Because of this approach of mine, a certain bias in favor of those pastors and scholars who made the church’s views heard in public is naturally unavoidable. A lack of sources makes it very di≈cult to draw any ‘‘representative’’ conclusions on attitudes toward Jews among rank-and-ﬁle laymen, be it church members or activists, let alone conclusions regarding the relevance of clerical attitudes for the rescue action itself. Frequently, scholars, journalists, and other intellectuals have presented ‘‘October 1943’’ as proof of the irrelevance or even absence of anti-Jewish resentment in modern Danish society. Similar to the case of England, antisemitism is understood to be an essentially un-Danish phenomenon. The roots of this concept are manifold: Danes are supposedly carrying an innate immunity against Jew-hatred—an immunity that is deﬁned either in an essentialist way, by pointing to the humane and tolerant national character of the Danish people, or in historical terms, by referring to a speciﬁcally smooth ‘‘Danish Path’’ into a democratic, pluralistic, modern society. Furthermore, dubbing antisemitism as an import—a German import—without autochthonous roots and traditions, helped to reinforce this notion of immunity. Finally, reference is often made to the speciﬁc nature of the Jewish community in Denmark, its ‘‘invisibility,’’ caused by the small number of\n\n8\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nJews and their high degree of acculturation and integration. The successful story of integration and the notion of innate tolerance has contributed to dramatic lacunae of critical research in terms of both DanishJewish history and the history of antisemitism in Denmark. There is no need to investigate an issue that is perceived to be nonexistent. Furthermore, the interpretative conﬁnement of the concept of antisemitism as un-Danish has frequently been accompanied by an often implicit comparative perspective that reinforced the notion of immunity. If German racial antisemitism and systematic genocide do not provide the standard of comparison, one may perceive other xenophobic and anti-Jewish stereotypes as marginal. One may dismiss single unequivocal expressions of antisemitism as irrelevant exceptions rather than investigate the origins, traditions, and functions of these concepts and explore the ways in which they have been instrumental in construing individual and collective identities by deﬁning the Jew as ‘‘the other.’’9 More recent research pursued by a younger generation of Danish scholars has begun to question the narrative of heroic humanism that would imply an immunity against fascism and antisemitism. Lone Rünitz’s investigation of the government’s restrictive refugee policy in the interwar period10 and the Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies’ research project on German and Austrian Jewish immigrants who attempted to seek refuge in Denmark are just two examples of this more critical research.11 In addition, Michael Mogensen has examined the antisemitic attitudes prevalent among the members of the Danish exilian community in Sweden,12 and together with Rasmus Kreth, has produced the ﬁrst thorough research on the rescue operation itself.13 Mogensen and Kreth have stressed the importance of the Swedes’ willingness to help and of the intentional passivity of key German authorities. In addition to this, their research has highlighted the less ﬂattering fact that the much-celebrated Danish ﬁshermen sailing the Jews to the safe shores of Sweden frequently demanded exorbitant payments, which in no way was justiﬁable by reference to their personal risk and often was legitimized by antisemitic references to Jewish wealth. Furthermore, Soﬁe Bak has published an introductory survey of the representations of the rescue operation in Danish postwar historiography and memorial culture.14 In addition, her work on Danish antisemitic movements in the early twentieth century is groundbreaking.15 In the framework of these attempts of reevaluation, a more critical view of the policy of collaboration has developed. ‘‘Cooperation’’ that implied the acceptance and implementation of limited discriminatory\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n9\n\nmeasures against Danish Jews actually did lead to an o√er by the Danish authorities to inter Danish Jews in September 1943 in an attempt to prevent the SS and Gestapo from pursuing a roundup. This contribution is obviously sharing a ‘‘revisionist’’ point of view since it argues that though an aggressive racial antisemitism found only little support in milieus a≈liated with the Lutheran Church, negative stereotypes about both Jews and Judaism nevertheless were widespread and constituted core elements of identity formation and group formation in these milieus. This is not to suggest that this ambiguity characteristic of clerical writing on Jewish issues accounts for the impact of antisemitism in Danish society or for the successful rescue of Danish Jews to Sweden. Previous articles have addressed the often overlooked complexities of the history of Danish-Jewish relations by underlining the need for a critical revision of the existing and often idealizing scholarship.16 This essay will demonstrate that the problematic and often repeated claim about Denmark being less antisemitic than most other European countries is misleading. The issue at stake is not ﬁrst and foremost the strength or weakness of Danish antisemitism, but the fact that in Danish Lutheran Church–a≈liated contexts, the debate on the status of Jews as part of European culture and society was cast in an antimodernist, anticapitalist, and anticommunist mold. As the internal dynamics of this clerical discourse contributed only marginally to the incremental delegitimization of antisemitism in Denmark, one has to look for other factors to explain the absence of antisemitic persecution in Denmark.17\n\nThe History of Danish-Jewish Relations The beginnings of a Jewish presence in the Danish Commonwealth date back to the seventeenth century, when Sephardic Jews in the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein attained freedom of movement and residence permits for the kingdom. Jews settled in Glückstadt (1620) and Altona (Danish since 1640), and then also in cities in the kingdom. In the course of the eighteenth century, Copenhagen became the primary center of Danish-Jewish cultural and political activities. In 1730, the Jewish community in Copenhagen consisted of approximately 300 members; in 1780 this number had risen to 1,600, which was more than 80 percent of the Jewish population residing in the kingdom and around 2 percent of the capital’s inhabitants. The ﬁrst Jews to carry on trade in Copenhagen were ‘‘Portuguese’’ Jews, who provided the court with ﬁnancial services and luxury goods\n\n10\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nsuch as jewelry. The ‘‘second or third generation’’ of Iberian émigrés had often migrated to Denmark via Amsterdam and Hamburg-Altona. In the course of the last decades of the seventeenth century, still more Ashkenazi Jews trickled into the kingdom, taking advantage of the generous privileges granted to the Sephardic merchants and bankers. Finally, in 1684, the Danish king legalized their status as a community in Copenhagen by granting them permission to hold public synagogue services in their homes. Due to the small size of their community, the Sephardic immigrants only obtained this status eleven years later. In the course of the following decades, the Ashkenazim soon outnumbered the Portuguese, but the concentration in wholesale and petty trade, commerce, and banking remained overwhelming.18 As a somewhat ironic contrast to the recent instrumentalization of the ‘‘Late Luther’’ for present political purposes, the contemporary impact of these writings even in a strongly Lutheran country such as Denmark was extremely limited. The protagonists of the Reformation in Denmark seemed not to see any need to refer to them or to their violent agenda. They did not translate Luther’s anti-Jewish works and seldom quoted from them before the 1720s, when they used his writing as arguments against Jews’ employing Christian servants. In a similar vein, they did not refer to Eisenmenger’s Jewry Uncovered—one of the most inﬂuential compendia of Christian anti-Jewish tenets published in 1700/ 1710—extensively before the 1770s. Of course, this does not imply that Luther’s and Eisenmenger’s views were irrelevant in a Danish context; on the contrary, Luther’s theological teaching on the Jews, in general, informed most of the important theological works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. An analysis of published sermons that mention Jews and Judaism points toward the prevalence of patterns and concepts familiar to us from other regions of Europe, which portrayed Jews as living warnings that eternally testiﬁed to the victory and truth of the Gospels and as the radical ‘‘Other’’—an enemy of God and the persecutor of his ﬂock. Similarly, clergymen frequently extended these concepts to encompass Jews as abstract symbols of heresy meant to warn present-day rationalist ‘‘heretics.’’ Furthermore, ministers also depicted Jews as morally corrupt and depraved. In many ways these images relate to the key narrative, the nexus of Jewish disobedience, deicide, and divine punishment—a key narrative strongly rooted in the early Christian and medieval tradition that one could also ﬁnd in Denmark. Thus, authors transferred this concept of\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n11\n\nobduracy and dispersion in reference to Jews even before they actually settled there. Such mentalities informed and inspired theological works, devotional literature, and paintings and frescos. Nevertheless, anti-Jewish accusations, as found in Medieval Central Europe, such as the poisoning of wells, ritual murder, or desecration of the Host, were not raised in Denmark. Through these views and images of Jews, inﬂuential clergy deﬁned the character of the Jewish presence in Denmark as deceitful and detrimental. Clergymen perceived Jews as speciﬁcally disturbing, though, only when their growing presence actually became an issue: only when, during the late seventeenth century, the confessional homogeneity of the population and the hegemony of Lutheranism seemed challenged, did the bishops of Zealand, such as Hans Wandal and Hans Bagger, begin to articulate their ‘‘unease’’ regarding the growing immigration of Jews and the presumably much too benevolent terms of settlement. This resulted in a harsh control of immigration, especially of poor Jews, and strict limitations of Jewish involvement in economic life. When the guilds saw their economic interests endangered, the authorities mostly responded favorably to their protests and curtailed Jewish privileges even further. In addition, Jews remained barred from Christian schools as well as from universities and mercantile corporations. Thus, a story of conﬂict, hatred, and exclusion grounded in religious legitimization and reinforced by economic competition was one long-neglected dimension of ChristianJewish relations in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Denmark. If one views this history in the light of a European comparative perspective, though, pre-emancipation privileges were more extensive, and the process of Danish-Jewish acculturation and social integration in the course of the nineteenth century went smoother, than in many other countries. Nevertheless, when Danes discussed the status of the Jews in Danish society in the wake of the state’s economic disaster of 1813, not only did they hold Jews responsible for the bankruptcy, but many authors described Jews as parasitic and alien to the Danish nation. Such conclusions implicitly deﬁned the Danish nation in religiously Christian and ethnocentric terms. While Enlightenment ﬁgures who had dominated the discourse on the ‘‘Jewish question’’ of earlier decades had underlined the need for ‘‘civic betterment and regeneration,’’ they still had upheld the basic principle of perfectibility. But with the gradual marginalization of these positions, the intense public debate of these years brought attitudes to the fore that presumed the impossibility of Jews’ becoming Danes.19 In the decades to follow, Romanticist intellec-\n\n12\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\ntuals rose to become the dominating opinion makers. Thus, it comes as no surprise that the only non-German territory to which the HepHep pogroms of 1819 spread to was Denmark. In the capital as well as in a number of towns in the province, the well-calculated and partly intentionally provoked violence of the alleged ‘‘mob’’ turned against Jews and their property. In 1830, Danes repeated this outbreak of anti-Jewish, anti-emancipationist violence with ideological, political, and economic underpinnings. In the 1830s and 1840s, the estate assemblies ﬁnally discussed the question of complete Jewish emancipation. Many deputies voiced strong opinions against granting further rights to Jews, and rural clerics, often depicted as the avant-garde of democratization and liberal values, rejected Jewish integration and legal equality on a combination of ethnicist and religious grounds: Jews could never become Danes because the core of being Danish was a profession of Christianity, and the essence of being Jewish was to belong to a nation alien to the Danish people.\n\nProtestant Clergy and the Jews in the Nineteenth Century For the time being, the government made no further progress in terms of Jewish emancipation. In fact, one of the most inﬂuential contemporaries, Nicolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig, the poet, politician, and patron saint of a supposedly tolerant and civic version of nationalism and arguably the most important Danish theologian, spoke out publicly against Jewish emancipation on similar ethnicist and religious grounds. In general, Grundtvig had a hard time ﬁnding any arguments against further Jewish rights that would not be all too selfcontradictory. Nevertheless, he favored a policy that would deny Jews su√rage and prevent their eligibility by prohibiting them land ownership, the prerequisite for all su√rage rights. Furthermore, when Meir Goldschmidt, the illustrious Danish-Jewish writer, participated in the heated debate over Schleswig in 1848–49, Grundtvig denied him the right to contribute to a discussion on an issue of such eminent national importance, since he—being a Jew—was and always would remain a guest in Denmark.20 After full emancipation in 1848–49, the successful democratization of Danish society and its economic stability since the second half of the nineteenth century did provide the prerequisites for a society fairly capable of integrating the Jewish community, as well as other immigrant communities. However, this did not imply any kind of immunity against\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n13\n\nracism, neither in a historical perspective nor in regard to present problems and debates. It repeatedly became clear that the high degree of ethnic homogeneity of the Danish population proved to imply its own trappings: a homogeneity reinforced by the all-but-monopoly of the Lutheran ‘‘state church.’’ Furthermore, traditions of xenophobia and racism can be traced back to a deﬁnition of Danishness that amalgamated ethnic and religious criteria: in this context, Lutheran pastors had repeatedly provided the key arguments by mobilizing the resistance against an extension of Jewish rights or even explicitly arguing against Jewish emancipation on religious grounds. Grundtvig constituted a key ﬁgure in this line of tradition, providing a link between the discourses of the eighteenth and of the early twentieth centuries. One may view his ambiguous stand on the issue of inclusion and exclusion as emblematic of the history of Danish-Jewish relations. In the late 1870s, Johannes Kok, Nicolai Gottlieb Blædel, Hans Lassen Martensen, Zealand’s bishop, and Frederik Nielsen, a professor of theology, notably all representatives of the church, caused the ﬁrst postemancipation conﬂicts on the status of Jews in Danish society.21 Dismissing what has been called ‘‘replacement theology’’ out of hand, in The Holy Land and Its Neighboring Countries in Past and Present, Kok described the restoration of Israel and the return to Zion drawing close.22 However, this in no way prevented him from perpetuating the Augustinian notion that the humiliated, marginalized Jews would provide the proof of the truth of the Gospel, nor from attacking observant Judaism in harsh words. Informed by Blædels’ Extended Conﬁrmation Textbook,23 he dismissed this halakhic observance as a set of meaningless rituals, bound together primarily by a vile hatred against Christians and Christianity. Martensen took this attack one important step further. In his widely disseminated Christian Ethics, he did not display much interest in observant Judaism. His obsession was rather with modern, assimilated, and emancipated Jews, constituting the primary force undermining the concept of the Christian nation-state. According to Martensen, the Jews had joined forces with individualistic hedonism, materialistic capitalism, radical skepticism, and anticlerical liberalism, and now they were taking the lead in a forceful attempt to destroy the organically grown Christian state. Martensen’s keywords were dissolution and destruction, and the means for this purpose were supposedly the Jews’ inﬂuence in the economy, in the press, and in politics. For him, the government had made a mistake granting emancipation to the Jews, and now the former guests had turned into despotic rulers. Interestingly enough, in spite of this vicious attack on the allegedly immense and detrimental power of mod-\n\n14\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nern Jews, Martensen still shared Kok’s eschatological hopes for the future. Thus, he argued that the Jews should be stripped of their civic rights, but still be encouraged to retain their ethnic identity in order to be prepared for their wholesale conversion and their function as God’s major missionary tool in the Last Days. Both lines of reasoning had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the debates of post-WWI Denmark. As Martensen dismissed traditional Judaism as a set of meaningless rituals, at the same time, he identiﬁed an urban, upper-middle-class culture that was hostile to the Christian establishment in the Jewish freethinker Georg Brandes. Thus by bracketing modern Judaism with secular Copenhagen and modern culture, he had linked the crucial topoi of the interwar period.24\n\nThe Rabbi’s Response: Abraham Alexander Wolff Brandes was not the only individual to react to these antiJewish diatribes. Rather, Abraham Alexander Wol√, the long-time chief rabbi of the Jews of Denmark, o√ered the most elaborate Jewish response. In The Enemies of the Talmud, Wol√ gave a ﬁve-hundred-page rebuttal where he not only distanced himself from Brandes’s secular liberalism, but articulated a sharp counterattack on the Lutheran pastors and theologians that in many ways had been inspired by August Rohling’s The Jew of the Talmud.25 Wol√ refuted the accusation that the Talmud was anti-Christian and established an ethic of double standards. On the contrary, he argued, Christianity should be careful not to ﬁnd itself in this ethical quandary. Furthermore, Wol√ claimed that the attacks against Jews were similar to those voiced against the early Christians by their heathen contemporaries. His response was e√ective since the debate ended when the pastors and theologians partially revised their publications. Nevertheless, the debate of the 1870s marked a crucial transition period that provided a bridge between the anti-emancipationist concepts of the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century and the rearticulation of anti-Jewish stereotyping since the late nineteenth century.\n\nBetween Inclusion and Exclusion: Jews in Twentieth-Century Denmark In the year 1931, fewer than 5,800 Jews lived in Denmark. The majority of them lived in the Danish capital, and more than 60 percent were born in the kingdom.26 The percentage of mixed marriages\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n15\n\nwas high—almost 45 percent in the decades from 1884 to 1903.27 In spite of the slow integration of East European Jews who immigrated at the turn of the century, the speed with which the Jews of the kingdom had climbed the social ladder and had gained acceptance was remarkable. In 1931, their average annual income was twice as high as the national average, though with a strong internal di√erentiation. In addition, since the end of the nineteenth century, Danes perceived Jews of the kingdom increasingly as compatriots. Nevertheless, the discourse of pastors and theologians on Jews and Judaism followed the general trends in Danish society—a society that turned out not to be immune to anti-Jewish attitudes at all. In contrast to the postwar view of Danish history that portrayed antisemitism as irrelevant, the political and social implications of these attitudes reveal that antisemitism played an important role. This becomes quite clear when we examine the changing images of ‘‘the Jew’’ and their political implications in the course of historical events: from the perception of the Jewish question as being imminent and urgent after World War I, to the reactions to the challenge of Nazi Germany, and ﬁnally to the dilemmas of occupation itself. In the ﬁrst decades of the twentieth century, Lutheran Church– a≈liated authors often pointed to the Jewish question as being pressing and highly problematic. Their views were also shared by nationalist movements reacting to the immigration of Eastern European Jews to Denmark and the alleged participation of a disproportionate number of Jews in the Russian Revolution. After the Nazi rise to power, the refugee problem became an issue in Denmark, as political and economic considerations as well as antisemitic attitudes guided politicians, diplomats, and bureaucrats. For example, the government’s memoranda and drafts for its refugee policy often contained anti-Jewish stereotypes. In addition, diplomats as well as police o≈cers regularly voiced harsh antiJewish arguments against immigration. In this situation, no critical voice from Lutheran pastors—neither as a reaction to the extremely restrictive refugee policy nor to the public debate about it—was to be heard. Instead, one ﬁnds, for example, statements by Lutheran ministers who described Reichskristallnacht as the result of a ‘‘stupid crime’’ committed by Herschel Grynszpan. Also among church-a≈liated authors, we ﬁnd the assumption that a higher number of Jews in Denmark, or a higher degree of visibility in Danish society, would create a ‘‘Jewish Problem’’ in Denmark as well. A longstanding tradition of antimodernism, as well as a strong a≈li-\n\n16\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nation with anticommunism, was presumably one of the most important reasons why inﬂuential Lutheran Church leaders, such as Christian Bartholdy, pastor and leader of the Pietist Home Mission, only belatedly came to reject Nazism, including its antisemitism. The Kirchenkampf (church struggle) helped him to hamper his excitement about a new chance for a moral revival in Nazi Germany, and instead to develop an apocalyptic thinking, now interpreting Nazism as the movement of the Antichrist. This reevaluation went hand in hand with a growing awareness that racist ideology would undermine the concept of an end-time conversion of Jews. In the 1930s, though, the willingness to go along with Nazi anti-Jewish measures was quite signiﬁcant in this milieu.28 The Pietists were by far not the slowest to develop a more critical stance. The Grundtvigians displayed a tendency to pragmatism encouraged by their traditional aversion against ‘‘intervening in state a√airs.’’ This could even imply ridiculing protests against a politics of collaboration that might risk introducing racial legislation against ‘‘Jewish pastors’’ to Denmark. Some Grundtvigians also went as far as stating that the Nazi regime was merely overreacting in a exaggerated way to a Jewish question constituting a real problem for German society. In general, a signiﬁcant distinction marked the years of occupation leading up to the attempted deportation. While a growing number of pastors publicly attacked anti-Jewish legislation and demanded a radical reaction of the Lutheran Church if it should be introduced in Denmark, the bishops only debated the issue but failed to agree on any public activity.29 In the light of these debates, the Lutheran Church’s fearless and unequivocal condemnation of the roundup has to be reevaluated. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Jewish issue had primarily been discussed as part of other discourses. To a signiﬁcant degree, it was not perceived as a problem in its own right that deserved to be addressed on the basis of human rights, but as part of a ‘‘missionary discourse’’ of antimodernism. In the fall of 1943, this Judenaktion situated the Jewish issue in a di√erent context. Now it was loaded with a speciﬁc national meaning and relevance. In turn, this contributed signiﬁcantly to the unequivocal and massive protest and the personal involvement of many pastors in the rescue action, even including Bartholdy. This points to a more general problem of postwar evaluation of prewar behavior. Frequently, the massive engagement of conservatives in the resistance caused their earlier involvement in antidemocratic—and for that matter anti-Jewish— activities to be blurred and forgotten.\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n17\n\nPredominant Perceptions of Jews in the Danish Church The traditions outlined here played themselves out in a complex set of notions and attitudes toward Jews and Judaism, which were surprisingly constant over the years. It will become apparent that there was no clear-cut distinction between traditional anti-Judaism and antisemitic stereotyping. Underlying recurrent common denominators were the lack of a distinction between contemporary Jews and Jews of antiquity, the semiracist concepts of Jewish mind or character, and the fundamental dilemma that antisemitism in its explicitly racist variant would question one of the axiomatic implications of these Christian concepts of Jews—the endeavor to convert them to Christianity. This goal was never given up, and excluding Christians of ‘‘Jewish origin’’ was always ruled out. Thus, a racial antisemitism as such was generally rejected out of hand. Nevertheless, Lutheran pastors and theologians never hesitated to emphasize that both the positive and the negative features of the Jewish spirit or character have to be mentioned. The negative traits seemed no less real to them simply because they belonged to the arsenal of antisemitic reasoning. Lutheran pastors and theologians acknowledged that a bright future awaited the Jewish people as converts, though in a long-term perspective they gave no legitimacy to a continued existence of ‘‘this peculiar religion.’’ They recognized that Jews still constituted the Chosen People of God, but they argued that after undergoing a mass conversion at the end time, Jews would have the crucial task to bring the Gospel to the rest of the world. The pastors and theologians accompanied these eschatological considerations with a strong contempt for Judaism as a religion. They labeled it ridiculous and pitiful legalism. In turn, they both condemned and celebrated the social and cultural isolation of traditional Orthodox Judaism as a precondition for the continued existence of the people. However, they disapproved of Reform Judaism as a hybrid phenomenon without religious sincerity and depth, and of assimilation as a cause of a ﬂaw of the character, a moral degeneration. They argued that this deformation was ‘‘proven’’ by listing ‘‘Jewish sins’’ that allegedly resulted from any attempt to assimilate. ‘‘Assimilated Jews,’’ they described, tended to oscillate between hypocritical servility and impudent audacity, between sensitive nervousness and obtrusive, pushy vigor, between interference and self-isolation. Assimilation and radical modernism, they stated, had\n\n18\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nturned Jews into a powerful threat to the indigenous host peoples, their moral survival, and national autonomy. They linked this to speculations on the reasons why antisemitism was weak in Denmark and much stronger in France and Germany. They concluded that in the latter the Jewish communities were more sizable and their power and arrogance had been all the more visible and inﬂuential. In this perspective, conﬂicts caused by antisemitism were seen as acts of Gentile/Christian self-defense, or deﬁned as an even-handed struggle between two equal parties. Despite these negative descriptions, clerical writers unequivocally praised the moral standards of traditional Judaism, especially its emphasis on the integrity of the home. They especially lauded its emphasis on family values and saw this as a role model for the disintegrating Christian family in modern society. They also argued that the distinctiveness and di√erence of Jewish existence had to be upheld. Nevertheless, they argued, Jews ought to do this without arrogant self-consciousness and pride. Instead, they should follow the path of Christian humility.30 As a consequence, emancipation and integration as liberal solutions to the Jewish question were dismissed, as ‘‘amalgamation’’ would not be compatible with the divine intention to make use of the Jews as the primary agents of the coming eschatological drama. But also Zionism was seen in ambivalent terms: it seemed to guarantee the continued existence of the Jewish nation and might be the ﬁrst step of a spiritual revival, but its secular character and self-assertive ‘‘pride’’ confused and annoyed Christian theologians. The attitudes and notions discussed above were articulated in the most explicit way in a speciﬁc milieu of the Israel Mission, linked to the inﬂuential organized Pietism of the Home Mission. But when analyzing other sources, one is surprised to ﬁnd how many other milieus shared these attitudes as well. Those who articulated these views were not part of a fringe sect, but an established, informed group of writers that a signiﬁcant segment of church-a≈liated individuals read regularly.31 When one compares these notions with the statements by bishops, scholars, and professors of theology, such as Frederik Nielsen or Frederik Torm, a high degree of consensus becomes obvious. This might not be surprising, since the Mission to Israel constituted almost the only way in which the Danish Lutheran Church engaged Jews directly. Nevertheless, there were alternative approaches on both sides of spectrum. The pastor Anders Malling, for one, illustrates the potential in this mission milieu for a≈liation with Nazi ideology. Malling became a member of the Danish Nazi Party, DNSAP, in the early 1930s and was\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n19\n\ninstrumental in programmatically formulating the party’s views concerning the relationship between state and church.32 While he demonstrated a signiﬁcant amount of critical distance toward the German role model, he was in no way intent on softening the antisemitic stance, but succeeded in combining Home Mission traditions of anti-Judaism with antisemitism.33 On the other wing of the theological spectrum and church politics there was Grundtvigianism, providing most of the Folk High Schools and their press with an ideological foundation. Politically, it was a rather broad movement. Nevertheless, it is important to focus on three of its theologians who expressed their views on Christianity and the Jewish question. In October 1933, in Dansk Udsyn, Ulrich Balslev published a detailed analysis of modern Jewish history and antisemitism.34 He argued that an ‘‘external factor’’ for antisemitism resulted from a need for individuals to place blame on a scapegoat for both economic turmoil and the erosion of a secure social status. The ‘‘internal factor’’ for antisemitism resulted from Danes’ characteristic nature. In Germany and in Denmark, Balslev stated, there existed Orthodox Jews and those who identiﬁed with the respective nation. Alongside these were assimilated Jews, who were most inﬂuential in arts, literature, and politics. Balslev described the latter as rootless and unfettered by national or cultural loyalties. In essence, he argued that these assimilated Jews failed to hold even a general sense of responsibility for the progress of the nation in which they lived. Therefore, these Jews became a great challenge to every society. Despite this obstacle, Danes had a strong sense of inner balance, of national unity, and of forceful ethnic cohesion that enabled them to integrate foreigners and make them fruitful participants in Danish culture. Germany, however, was much more diverse, heterogeneous, and at conﬂict with itself; therefore, this inner tension transformed into antisemitism. Primarily then, Balslev placed central blame on the non-Jewish Germans and challenged them to overcome their national crisis and integrate Jews into society. One might have hoped for a more unequivocal criticism. Nevertheless, the author did diverge from stating that Nazi anti-Jewish policy was legitimate and a justiﬁable answer to the so-called Jewish threat. It is important to note, however, that the new ‘‘rules of discourse’’ did not develop among Danish pastors and theologians before Reichskristallnacht and in most cases after the occupation. Before this point, they continued to point to Jews as the cause for anti-Jewish sentiments in\n\n20\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\nGermany. Even after the occupation, Danish Lutheran pastors and theologians did not give up this perspective entirely, but rather, simply articulated it less explicitly. Their primary focus shifted to a refutation of a radical, aggressive racism and the practice of persecution. Now they described antisemitism as a basically pathological and primarily German phenomenon. In turn, their debates revolved around the issue of racial discrimination in Denmark, which, in essence was a debate on the issue of collaboration versus resistance. One may ﬁnd a prominent example of this in the writings of the theologian K. E. Løgstrup. In a series of articles from December 1941 to May 1942, published in church periodicals, he attacked hatred of Jews. In his writings, he argued that antisemitism resulted from a psychotic need for a scapegoat; a need that the Danish people ought to be immune to because of their enlightenment and sense of justice. In turn, he called on his compatriots uncompromisingly to reject any German demands for anti-Jewish legislation. Similarly, Halfdan Høgsbro deﬁned racist antisemitism as anti-Christian since Christ and all the apostles and prophets had Jewish blood. Only a few authors, however, took this critical point of view one crucial step further and argued unequivocally in favor of cultural, religious, and ethnic pluralism. For example, in 1938 and 1939, the theologian F. L. Østrup did this in a series of essays he published in the leading conservative daily, Berlingske Tidende. Though much less knowledgeable about Jewish history and religion than Balslev, he still systematically refuted antisemitic charges of deicide and false claims about the Talmud and Jewish support for immorality and the Russian Revolution. He even questioned extreme antisemitic nationalism by arguing that nationalism always needed to be balanced with an element of internationalism. According to Østrup, the Danish Jews provided this international perspective; he wrote: ‘‘The physiognomy of Denmark in its totality would be so much more boring, sad and homogeneous without the Jews. . . . What a loss, aesthetically, morally, religiously, yes in all kinds of ways, if the Jews disappeared!’’35 His convincing argument in favor of protecting the unique distinctiveness of Jewish existence in Denmark has to be contrasted with the perceptive patterns outline earlier. Østrup’s voice constituted an exception. It was much more common for Lutheran pastors and theologians to embrace antisemitism as part of their worldview that displayed admiration for Nazi Germany or, at least, did not place ﬁrst priority on the condemnation of its anti-Jewish policy. The attitudes expressed by Lutheran pastors and theologians were more self-deceptive when writers thought of themselves as being friendly\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n21\n\nand well-meaning to Jews. They reinforced the importance of such ‘‘well-intended’’ views by the attempt not to be antisemitic, or even to be philosemitic. Writers either held to the notion that there was no breeding ground for antisemitism in Denmark or viewed antisemitism as a danger and saw themselves as combatants of this threat. This self-perception rendered these milieus vulnerable to antisemitic patterns of perception and political thought, and even to Nazi antisemitic policies to some degree. It was only during the occupation that many reversed their views. One may see an example of this in local Lutheran Church publications. From late 1941 to 1943 numerous articles condemned Nazi antisemitism and ruled out any kind of anti-Jewish legislation in Denmark. This campaign, however, was part of a defense for Danish national sovereignty and independence. The article authors now saw the Jews as part of the body politic. Rejecting anti-Jewish measures had become part of a national consensus by which to deﬁne the limits of collaboration; it was in no way a defense of the notion of a pluralistic society or universal rights of cultural and ethnic minorities. The attitude of pastors toward Jews and Judaism, even with all of its ambiguities, especially made this fundamental distinction clear. This was the reason why the persistence of antiJewish perceptions could exist at the same time alongside a resistance against Nazi persecution and a willingness to be in active solidarity with the Jews in October 1943. How did Danish Jews react to this problem? Generally speaking, there was a tendency to keep a low proﬁle and to trust the Danish politicians. Nevertheless, in 1936, Rabbi Marcus Melchior articulated the most inﬂuential response to antisemitic accusations in a polemical booklet.36 In the tradition of Wol√, Melchior focused on describing how authors such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Alfred Rosenberg had misused the Talmud.\n\nConclusion The central question that still lingers is this: why did an aggressive racial antisemitism ﬁnd almost no support in milieus a≈liated with the Danish Lutheran Church? This question is obviously linked to the even more general question: why was antisemitic violence almost absent in Denmark in general? And why did antisemitism never produce an inﬂuential political agenda for action nor grow into a powerful political force? To be sure, these questions require complex answers that cannot be restricted to theology, but have to take into account the long-term\n\n22\n\nThorsten Wagner\n\ndevelopment of liberal democracy, the fairly stable process of economic modernization, and the traditions of political culture. In many ways, though, we are only beginning to explore the dissemination and function of antisemitic patterns of perception, interpretation, and behavior in Denmark. More than likely, future studies will be less ﬂattering than the long-cherished self-indulging perceptions of a peaceful and humanistic nation. We know that the weakness of racial antisemitism did not at all prevent anti-Jewish stereotypes from being disseminated and inﬂuential even in the face of Nazism. While antisemitism found no home in symbolic politics, legislation, or jurisdiction, it did receive sympathy in regard to administrative practice and political debates. Antisemitic attitudes were in no way delegitimized on a wholesale basis before the German occupation of the country and before the Final Solution began to cast its shadow on Denmark. The rescue of Danish Jewry in October 1943 notwithstanding, negative perceptions and attitudes toward Jews and Judaism played a conspicuous role in the Danish Lutheran Church–a≈liated milieus in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. Danish theologians and clerics contributed signiﬁcantly to this by relating the reﬂection on Jewish issues to antipluralist missionary ambitions or antimodernist and anticapitalist discourses. Only when the turn of events forced them to frame these issues in terms of the dilemma of collaboration versus resistance and the speciﬁc challenge involved for the church did categories such as the protection of human rights or ethnic and cultural diversity gain ground. Thus, traditions of anti-Judaism and varying modes of consent with modern antisemitic concepts were not delegitimized as such before the occupation and the rescue action—as an act of national resistance—enforced a process of rethinking in milieus a≈liated with the church. Only then, the episcopal protest against the Judenaktion grew into a consensual expression of popular contempt for the occupation regime. In turn, existing anti-Jewish attitudes did not become a hindrance to the national project of protecting the Danish Jews—as Danes—from persecution and death. In February 1942, Halfdan Høgsbro articulated this view so unequivocally in a church newspaper: ‘‘We do not step into the breach for the Jews because they are human beings of some special worth, but because they are human beings and because God has commanded us to treat human beings in a humane way.’’37 Even in the second half of the twentieth century, this fundamental ambiguity has not lost its impact on the discourses on Jews and Judaism. In spite of a growing diversiﬁcation and secularization of society, the\n\nBelated Heroism\n\n23\n\nantipluralistic dream of an ethnically and culturally homogeneous Danish national community lives on. This becomes visible in both the xenophobic and the Islamophobic character of the immigration and integration debate as well as in an unholy alliance of residual elements of conventional antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiments.\n\nNOTES 1.
