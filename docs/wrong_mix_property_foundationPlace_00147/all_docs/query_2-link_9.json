SCHIRMER 2&S79 Digitized by Googl( BAK£R'S BIOGRAPHICAL DICriONARY OF MUSICIANS PREFACE In the preparation of the present edition it was the editor's constant care to maintain the high standard of impartiality, completeness and accuracy that characterized the two earlier editions, and have estabUslied Dr. Baker's Dictionary as an authoritative work of reference. Tlie long^ period (13 years) that has elapsed between this and the last edition accounts for the considerable increase in the size of the lxx)k. Besides necessary additions to the older articles room had to be found for some 2000 new biographies. In order to keep the contents within the limits of a single volume a number of the less important eariier musicians have been eliminated. The general reader is not likely to notice their omission; the musicologist will naturally turn to Eitner's Quellenlexikon. R^[arding the alphabetical arrangement, the following method has been adoptc<l: ae, oe, ue are treated as distinct letters; no distinction is drawn be- tween original vowels (a, o, n) and nKKlitiwi vowels {d, d, «). Thus Sthai i i.r comes before Schafer. However, in such cases as Forster and Forstkr, when both forms are represented by several individuals, the names have been divided into two groups, the one with the original vowel preceding. In the case of two or more Christian names the order is determined by the name generally known. Thus Waoner, (VViluelm) Ricila.rd before Wagner, Siegfried. The system of transliteration of Russian names adopted for this Dictionary requires some explanation. (1) X is rendered by ch because the velar aspirate which it represents is familiar from the Scotch {loch) and numerous German words (Back, Bnich, Koeh). Furthermofe, it was piWerred to kh, because in all languages the symbol k uniformly represents the one familiar sound, whidi is also retained in the combination kh in words of foreign origin {khaki, khan, khedive) ; whereas no such uniformity can be claimed for ch, even in English {child, chemist, choir, machine, yacht). (2) M is transliterated as tch. In the first place, the initial sound is actually t (followed by sh). Then, a practical consideration addtxl great weight: Such forms as Tchaikovsky, T<iii:ri:p\\iv, etc., which have gained general currency in English-speaking countries (nx recent years also adopted in several French publications), difTer but slightly from TSCHAIKOWSKY, TscHERi- PNiM, ctc., tlie form uscxJ in all other European countries. The alphabetical arrangement under T, then, is universal. ( V) bl, which represents a sound quite i>eculiar to Russian (halfway l)i t\\\\n a e and u), is transliterated as y. The usual transliterations as i or y are both inaccurate. (4) For zh suggested itself as the natural transliteration, being the voiced sibilant corresponding to its voiceless male sh (the identical relation as between z and s). (5) The 'soft' vowels 'b, fO, H are transliterated as ye, yu, ya when initial, and in the feminine adjective ending (aya) ; as ie, iu, ia when medial. (6) b, technically silent, is by many omitted in translitera- tion. But it invariably 'softens' the preceding sound, and is actually heard as a ver>' faint fricative. Therefore it is consistently represented by j {zhizuj, vidielj). — Two or three concessions have been made to custom. The famous publi^ier Yurgsnson appears as Jusgenson, because in this form the name is familiar from the title-pages of his publications. Kyi seemed a little too startling (as yet); therefore the French form Cut was retained. In thisoon- Digitized by Google PREFACE nection it may be remarked that such forms as Borodixk, Scriabine, Lia- POUNON , lie, .lie IVench transliterations. Those interested are referred to the articles l»y M. Mont ii,Mi-Nathan and S. VV. Pring oa Russian-English Translitcralion in the London 'Musical Times' (Nov. and DtH., 1<>17): the system of the British War Office was published in the same journal (Feb., 1918j. All Russian dates are made to correspond to the Western Calendar. Special care has been exercised on this impf)rt.mt jKiint. Promiscuous use of both styles has caused much confusion, esi)et i.iliy in b<H)ks gi\\ inj; only the year of an event. Thus it is slated by one writer that Balakirev was born in 1836, and by another, in 1837. The fact is, that according to the Russian Calendar lie was bom Dec. 21, 1836, and according to the Western Calendar on Jan. 2, 1S37. The orthography of foreign languages has been made to conform to the latest recommendations of the respective academies (where such exist) or other recognized authorities. The large space devoted to bibliography is only prop<jrtioiiate to the importance of the subject. Reference to sources, where fuller t re.it ment can be found, coustilules a natural and essential supplement to the necess;irily condensed statements of a Dictionary. Much time and thought have been jjiven to the seleclion of titles, and only such have been included as are of real value. The care ex[X'nded on this part of the task has re-ulte<l not <m!\\ in the correction of errors (wrong titles, dates or i)laces of publicalit>u, conlusitju of different editions, etc.) in the bibliography of preaecessors, but many im* portant items in the articles themselves have thus been verified or corrected. Among the outstanding merits of the original edition of this Dictionary was trustworthiness. Hiindre<ls of errors contained in the standard works of reference had been discovered by L)r. Baker, and eliminated in his own work. Nothing had been accepted without critical ocamination. The same policy has been followed in the preparation of the present edition, and for this pur(V)sc the following rtnent authorities ha\\e bwu crititally examined and collated: Robert Eitner, Biograplnsch-biblio}irapliisclics Quellen-Lexikon (10 vols.; Leipzig. 1900-4), with its quarterly supplements 'Miscellanea Mumca; bio-bibliographica' ; Krnesto Vieira, Diccionario bto^raphico dc Musicos portu- guezes (2 vols.; Lisbon, IQOO); Felix Clement and Pierre Luroussc, Diction- jfffM&^s Operas, new ed. rev. by A. Pougin (Paris, 1904); Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2d ed. by J. A. FuUer-Maitland (5 vols.; London, 1904-10): Giuseppe Albinati. Dizionario di Opere /ca/ra/i (Milan, 1913); Al- bert Lavignac, Encyrlopt^die de la Musiqiie et Dictionnaire dti Consrn^atoire (Paris; 3 vols, since 1913); Hugo Ricmann, iUu«7f/e.viifeo« (8th ed.; Leip/cig, 1916), as well as the earlier Russian and French translations containing ampli- fu It ions not ulili/.i <l in the last German e<litic»; Tobias Norlind, AUmant Muiikirxiknn {1 \\<»is.; Stocklif >lni, 191C>). FAcry point of dlvert;encf found in these works has been carefully investigated, and the result embodictl in i\\ic present edition of the Dictionary. In the vast majority of cases the pronunciation of foreign names has been indicated in braclrets. Of course, nothing can take the place of the h\\ in^ sound; all phonetic systems are only a matter of more or less close approxima- tion. That of the 'Association Internationale Piionetique (the best yet de- vised) is far too complicated for the layman to master without special study. Digitized by Google PREFACE The editor, therefore, adopted, with sHght modifications, a simple and very practical system devised by Ur. Theodore Baker for his Pocket Manual oj Musical Terms (New York, 1905). From living musicians information has been obtained, wherever possible, through personal correspondence. Comparatively few letters have remained unanswered. In such cases the editor was obliged to gather what information he could from various sources more or less reliable, a process in whidi mudi valuable time was consumed — rather, wasted. Despite all vigilance, the present edition undoul)tedly contains mistakes. Any corrections or suggestions tending to the improvement of the next edition will be gratefully received, and should be addressed to the editor, in care of the publishers. To the many artists who have cheerfully contributed the require<l material the editor extends his sincere thanks. He takes pleasure in acknowledging his obligations to Messrs. Richard Aldrich, William H. Humiston and R. F. Lodir of New York, Felix Rorowski of Chicago, Joseph E. SchuScker of Pitts- burgh and John Curtis of Philadelphia for valued favors of various kinds, (furnishing materials for other than personal biographies, loan of rare books, etc.). To Dr. Otto Kinkeldey, chief of the music-division of the New York Public Library, the editor is indebted for the privily of unrestricted access to parts of ihv library closcxl to the public, as well as for personal assistance in obtaining information; after his enlistment in the army his assistant, Mr. Julius Mattfeld, dieerfully rendeiied similar service. Special thanks are due to E>r. Theodore Baker, not only for his scrupulous care in reading the proofs, but cN-en more for valuable advice and a deep personal interest throughout the progress of the work. In conclusion the editor feels impelled to express his appreciation of the unlimited freedom granted him in carrying out nis plans. F<m* this he owes thanks to Mr. Rudolph E. Schirmer. The Editor.
