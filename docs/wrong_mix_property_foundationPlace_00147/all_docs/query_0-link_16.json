It is also the country that has intrigued outsiders most, both in the past and more recently, when events there paved the way for the transformation of the whole region. It is thus fitting that this should have been the first volume in a series that covers all the states. But Poland, more than most places, can only be understood after examining a long and often tumultuous history, from the origins, to the temporary disappearance, to the rebirth and repeated mutations. Beyond history and politics, it is essential to consider the economy, society, culture, and religion of a country. This task is greatly facilitated by the Historical Dictionary of Poland. For all its attention to the present situation, there is ample information on earlier periods. Despite the emphasis on politics, economics, society, culture, and religion are not overlooked. After a brief introduction, more than 500 entries focus on crucial persons, places, events, institutions, and so on. The entries can more readily be inserted into the historical framework, thanks to a comprehensive chronology and a list of rulers. There is also a long list of abbreviations and acronyms from the Communist and post-Communist eras, which is essential to understanding the entries. An extensive bibliography directs readers to further sources of information. Some very useful sources were produced by the author of this volume. Dr. George Sanford, professor of politics at the University of Bristol, is a leading authority on Poland and has written widely on 20th-century history and politics. His books include Polish Communism in Crisis, Military Rule in Poland, Democratization in Poland, Poland: The Conquest of History and Democratic Government in Poland. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nix\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage x\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xi\n\nNote on Polish Spelling and Usage\n\nThe Polish alphabet contains most of the Latin letters (the exceptions being q, v, and x), but it also has a number of additional accented letters. The latter may look complicated but, unlike English, have the virtue of generally regular pronunciation. The same applies to most other aspects such as the stress normally falling on the penultimate syllable as well as the pronunciation of the initially awkward-looking combinations of consonants such as rz, cz, or sz. The Polish alphabet: a, a˛, b, c, c´, d, e, ˛e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, l/, m, n, n´ , o, ó, p, r, s, s´ , t, u, w, y, z, z´, z·. For a guide to Polish pronunciation, the reader is referred to M. CorbridgePatkianowski, Polish (London: English Universities Press, 1964. “Teach Yourself” series). The most important pointers to remember in the pronunciation of the accented letters is that the cedillas on the ˛e, and a˛, produce nasal, almost “n” sounding equivalents as in the following examples: ma˛dry is pronounced “mondry” and re ˛ ce reads “rence.” The crossed l is pronounced in Polish almost like the English w, for example, Bolesl/aw = Boleswaf. The ó, as in róg, is pronounced like the English u = “ruk.” The author has used the Polish forms of names and terms as much as possible. The exceptions are twofold. Firstly, the Anglicized version has clearly become predominant in English usage in a limited number of major cases. To avoid confusion this has, therefore, been accepted in such instances as Warsaw, Pomerania, Greater and “Little” Poland, Silesia, and Vistula. Where usage seems more equally balanced, the Polish form has been preferred (so Kraków not Cracow and Szczecin not Stettin). The other problem is that place names in Poland or on its borders have changed over historical time. There are, therefore, Polish, German, Russian, as well as Ukrainian, Belarusan, or Lithuanian equivalents available whose usage often denotes a national preference, if not claim. The rule has been applied that, aside from the above-mentioned Anglicizations, all\n\nxi\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\nxii •\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xii\n\nNOTE ON POLISH SPELLING AND USAGE\n\nnames referring to postwar Poland and to historical periods when Poland was in possession should be in the Polish form. It is difficult to be entirely consistent, as different powers have dominated territories at different times. Sometimes it is fairly clear when to use Danzig not Gda´nsk or Breslau not Wrocl/ aw, for example, but other cases are more controversial as in such examples as Vilnius, Wilno, and Vilna, or Lvov, Lwów, Lv’iv, and Lemberg. With the emergence of independent Ukrainian, Belarusan, and Lithuanian states, the convention that is most likely to diminish historical hatreds and encourage stability in the region is that the currently dominant power should have its usage preferred, while alternative national forms should be offered as subsidiary alternatives. Another difficulty is that authors resident abroad, or their publishers, apply varying practices in relation to Polish names and title headings. This introduces inconsistencies into the bibliography. A final residual oddity and complication has been the deplorable tendency, especially in the United States, to produce compromise Latinized forms, such as Stanislaus for Stanisl/ aw and Boleslaus for Bolesl/ aw.\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xiii\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms\n\nAK AL AWS AWS-RS BBWR BBWR CAP CD III RP COMECON COP CPSU CRZZ CUP DiP EBRD EU FDP FJN GATT GISZ GDP

It is, however, protected by the Carpathian Mountains to the south and by the Baltic Sea to the north. These geographical realities have conditioned Poland’s historical development until recent times. It explains why the country’s expansion was mainly east and west but very rarely southward. Likewise, German and Russian threats came from the west and east. Open frontiers also placed a great premium on effective state organization in order to ensure competitive survival. Poland achieved a working balance between the royal power and gentry democracy and maintained itself as a great European state until the 17th century. The reasons for its subsequent decline are outlined in this introduction and in the dictionary entries. The weakening of the central power through mechanisms such as the elective monarchy and the Liberum Veto created the proverbial Polish anarchy. Aristocratic clans and their numerous gentry hangers-on ruled their bailiwicks while whittling down the royal power necessary to compete with ever stronger Muscovite and Prussian neighbors. By the end of the 18th century, this process led to the loss of state independence and a threefold partition by Russia, Prussia, and Austria until 1918. After the short interlude of interwar independence, Poland, both as a state and as nation, was threatened by German Nazism during World War II and by Soviet communism subsequently. The reader should constantly bear in mind how this historical experience has set the agenda until very recently for the resolution of all Poland’s international, political, economic, and social problems. Whether foreign rule, a peripheral position relative to Western Europe, or domestic weaknesses have been primarily responsible for Poland’s delayed modernization is still hotly disputed. What is clear, however, is that the ending of Soviet control and the communism system in 1989 has created unprecedented opportunities for\n\nxxxi\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\nxxxii •\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPoland. The country has been able to reinterpret its historical experience in a way that now supports the democratic political system and the civiccultural values desired by the Polish nation. The country’s reincorporation in European political-economic and in Euro-Atlantic security structures is also well on the way; for the first time, in quite literally centuries, it now supports the favorable domestic trends, despite the challenge of cultural and social backlashes against the costs of the restructuring transformation. Poland still has a very large economic gap to make up in comparison with its Western partners. Vast social, administrative, and other problems abound, but the framework for a favorable resolution within a few decades is now in place. From the Origins to the Piast and Jagiel//l onian Dynasties The origins of the Poles are wreathed in controversy. It is, however, generally agreed that they developed out of West Slav tribes that settled in the Oder and Vistula basins from the 9th century onward. The partly mythical Piast is held to have established the dynasty named after him some time before the definite emergence of Mieszko I and the Polish state in the middle of the 10th century. By accepting Christianity for himself and for his people in 966, on the basis of his marriage to the Czech (Bohemian) princess Dobrava the previous year, Mieszko gained international recognition as Royal Duke of the Polish state. But the Bohemian connection, as well as bypassing the hostile Germans, turned Poland culturally toward the West. In terms of religious and political values, it was linked to the Vatican and away from Byzantium and the Eastern Orthodoxy of Muscovite Russia. Mieszko’s unification of the central Polish heartland state based in Pozna´n, with its western boundaries lying along the present River Oder frontier, was rounded off southward through the conquest of Moravia and Slovakia and eastward to roughly the current eastern border by his son Bolesl/ aw I the Brave. The latter established the Gniezno Archbishopric as the center of the Roman Catholic Church, codified the state administration, and had himself crowned king just before his death in 1025. But his successors were weakened and pushed back by continual German invasions and the fissiparous tendencies of their feudal vassals. At the death of Bolesl/ aw III (Wrymouth) in 1138, the kingdom was divided among his three sons. The subsequent process of feudal disintegration lasted for almost two centuries with the center of gravity moving to Kraków. During this time Poland’s very existence faced two new threats. A series of Mongol and Tatar (Tartar) invasions from the east devastated the country on numerous occasions. The most serious thrust in 1241 got as far as Legnica on the Polish-\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxiii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxiii\n\nGerman frontier before the invaders turned back. Even more seriously, Konrad of Mazowsze introduced the Order of Teutonic Knights into northern Poland in 1226 in order to protect his northern borders against pagan Prussians. The Order of Teutonic Knights, however, exterminated most of the latter, seized Polish territory, encouraged German colonization to its religious-military state, and massacred Polish populations. A strong Polish central state power was reestablished in Greater Poland, / okietek (“the Short” or “Little Kraków, and Sandomierz by Wl/adysl/aw I L Elbow”). He had himself crowned King in 1320 while his son Kazimierz III (the Great) completed his work in a long and glorious reign from 1333–1370. Kazimierz regained control of Mazowsze as well as the Dobrzy´n and Pl/ock Lands in the north. His greatest gains in the east, Halicz Ruthenia, Podolia, Chel/m, and Vladimir, more than doubled his father’s territory. Kazimierz’s legal and financial reforms, massive rebuilding program, establishment of the Kraków Academy (University) in 1364, and patronage of culture, moreover, consolidated the domestic foundations of a strong Polish state; this proved as crucial as his military expansion. He was also lucky in that his failure to produce a male heir did not work out badly for Poland. Jadwiga, the daughter of his short-lived successor, Louis the Hungarian, by marrying Grand Duke Jagiel/ l/o of Lithuania in 1386, established the Jagiel/ l/onian dynasty and the Polish-Lithuanian union. Both were to carry the dual nation to its greatest heights in late medieval and early modern times. Wl/ adysl/ aw II Jagiel/ l/ o’s great victory over the Teutonic Knights in 1410 removed their threat, but they were not finally defeated until the Thirteen Years’ War of 1454–1466. Poland regained Pomerania, Gda´nsk, and Warmia by the Treaty of Toru´n, which ended the war. It asserted its suzerainty over the Order of Teutonic Knights, which converted itself into a secular duchy, paying homage to the Polish Crown in 1525. Jagiel/ l/ o’s successors, the greatest of which were Kazimierz IV (the Jagiel/ l/ onian), Zygmunt I (the Old), and Zygmunt II Augustus, ruled what was then the largest and most far-flung state in Europe. It stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea, although Poland failed to recover Silesia and West Pomerania (Szczecin) of the original Piast lands in the west. The Renaissance period of the late 15th–16th centuries also saw a great flowering of the arts and learning in Poland. The astronomer Nicholaus (Mikol/aj) Copernicus (Kopernik) and the humanist writer Jan Kochanowski are the most prominent names of this period. Architecture and building as well as economic life also developed, with Poland’s trade, especially in the Baltic, expanding dramatically. This was the Golden Age of religious toleration in Poland, with humanist values predominating. Calvinism spread among the\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\nxxxiv •\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmagnates and gentry, while Lutheranism became influential in the towns, although the Hussites of Bohemia were repelled. The Counter-Reformation, however, developed with the appearance of the Jesuits in the middle of the 16th century. Regaining the ground lost by Roman Catholicism took a century and contributed to the domestic causes of Poland’s decline. After more than a century and a half of personal dynastic union, Poland and Lithuania were amalgamated into the Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) of both nations by the Union of Lublin of 1569. This catered for the extinction of the Jagiel/ l/ onian dynasty on Zygmunt II Augustus’s death in 1572. Poland then made the disastrous mistake of making its monarchy fully elective. The institution allowed foreign powers to meddle in Poland’s domestic affairs by putting up their own dynastic candidates for the throne. Poland’s parliamentary institutions, the Sejm and the Senate, had gained great privileges such as the Nihil Novi statute earlier in the century. This had prevented the development of Royal Absolutism as in Tudor England. But the decentralized estates model of Polish parliamentarianism now divided the dominant szlachta class of magnates and their very large number of noble-born gentry supporters into warring clans. Their support had to be bid for through concessions and privileges incorporated in a Pacta Conventa. This process eventually reduced the executive royal power to naught, while the elected throne became the plaything of chance and circumstance. The system, however, worked quite well for a while. Stefan Batory of Transylvania (1576–1586) proved a strong and successful ruler. The throne then went to three successive members of the Catholic branch of the Swedish Vasa (Waza) dynasty. The first, Zygmunt III, overextended Poland’s capacities through his long, drawn out attempt to regain control of the Swedish throne, which he held as joint king from 1591–1599, before being expelled by his fiercely Lutheran uncle. His expedition to Moscow and the attempt to place his son Wl/adysl/ aw on the throne of Muscovy failed, but he expanded the Commonwealth even farther in Smolensk and the Ukraine to its ultimate eastward limits. The Union of Brze´sc´ (Brest) of 1596 did not win over the Orthodox masses through liturgical concessions. The church hierarchy, however, accepted papal supremacy and established the Greek Catholic, or Uniate, Church. The Commonwealth was primarily weakened from within, by the growth of Catholic fanaticism during the Counter-Reformation, the decline of gentry manners, and patriotism into an unproductive Sarmatianism and the peculiar, if not unique, balance of political institutions. The latter continually diminished the central royal power in favor of the aristocratic families, such as the Radziwil/ l/ s, with their huge estates and personal armies. The latter\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxv\n\nmade up of hangers-on drawn from the large, but often landless and fiercely arrogant, gentry class. This gave them not only control of the local regional Sejms but also overweening influence in the state. Just how harmful this could be was shown during the reign of Jan Kazimierz, elected in 1648. From 1652 onward, when Wl/ odzimierz Sici´nski used the first Liberum Veto, a single Sejm deputy could annul all its work and dissolve it. The Commonwealth, therefore, could not cope with the major external threats that faced it from every side. Bohdan Chmielnicki’s enormous Cossack Uprising of 1648–1651 lost Poland the eastern half of the Ukraine by 1660 as well as Smolensk, thus opening the way to Russia’s expansion. The Swedish “Deluge” (Potop) of 1655–1660 devastated the country, lost Prussia, which was annexed by Brandenburg in 1657, and the Inflanty (Latvia/Southern Estonia). It came within a hairsbreadth of being partitioned. But even now the Commonwealth had the capacity of fighting back under effective leadership, such as that of Hetman Jan Czarniecki in the 1650s and Jan Sobieski, who was elected king as result of his smashing victory of Chocim against the Turks. That Sobieski could not extract any direct benefit for Poland from his even greater victory, which saved Vienna in 1683, and that he could not even have his son elected before his death in 1696 attests to the extent of the Commonwealth’s decline. With Sobieski’s passing, Poland really became the plaything of foreign powers. The two Saxon electors who succeeded him cared little for the country’s interests. Augustus II was driven out by Charles XII of Sweden and replaced by a rich magnate, Stanisl/ aw Leszczy´nski, from 1704 to 1709. Peter the Great dominated Polish affairs on Augustus’s return. This effective control was almost institutionalized by the “Dumb Sejm” of 1717, which was manipulated by the Russian ambassador and his troops. Russia gained the right of interfering in Poland’s affairs under the guise of protecting its coreligionists and guaranteeing the “anarchy” caused by gentry privileges. When the next election was won by Leszczy´nski in 1733, Russia and Austria invaded in order to install their new Saxon puppet, Augustus III. What then followed was the unexpected development of a reform movement within the progressive section of the szlachta led by the Czartoryski “family.” The latter was composed of their own very large clan and associated allies, such as the Potockis and Lubomirskis. Catherine the Great of Russia again intervened in 1764 to force the election of her erstwhile lover, Stanisl/ aw Augustus Poniatowski, himself a relative of the Czartoryskis. As the last king of Poland he patronized the arts and was by no means a Russian puppet, although his political influence was weak.\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\nxxxvi •\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCivil War broke out in Poland with the reactionary Confederation of Radom of 1767 being opposed by the progressives of Bar the following year. The latter’s challenge to Russian control and problems in the Turkish War inclined Catherine the Great to join with Prussia and Austria in lopping off large areas of Poland in the First Partition of 1772. The shock caused by this event strengthened the reform movement. It precipitated the establishment of the Commission of National Education and encouraged various other political and social reforms. All this culminated in the work of the Four-Year Sejm of 1788–1792 and the liberal constitution of 3 May 1791. Influenced by the French Revolution, the latter was one of the most progressive documents of its time and has remained a potent symbol in subsequent Polish history. Once again the Polish conservatives formed a confederation, the most infamous in Polish history, of Targowica, to solicit Russian help. The resulting Second Partition of 1793 between Prussia and Russia provoked Tadeusz Ko´sciuszko’s last-ditch attempt to preserve the nation through a national uprising. Despite mobilizing the peasants, who won the battle of Racl/ awice with their picturesque scythes, the Poles were suppressed, very bloodily, by the full might of the Russian army. Russia, Austria, and Prussia divided the remaining Polish lands between them, quelling the last remnants of the nation’s independence, in 1795. Partitioned Poland The Poles rallied to Napoleon, fighting for him in various Legions. But he made cynical use of their enthusiasm. He sent many of them to perish on the Caribbean island of San Domingo, whose black slaves had revolted against French rule, while others later served in Spain. The only tangible benefit for the Poles was the Duchy of Warsaw, established in 1807 out of territories seized by Prussia during the partitions; even that was to be ruled by the king of Saxony. It was extended two years later with similar lands grabbed by Austria. The Poles also made an enormous contribution to Napoleon’s campaign against Russia in 1812. But it is not certain that the dynastically minded and shortsighted emperor would have resurrected a major independent and progressive Polish state to counterpoise his conservative enemies in Central and Eastern Europe, even if he had been successful. The Napoleonic epic, nevertheless, made a huge impact on the Polish consciousness. It was particularly strong during the 19th-century struggle for independence, when it was associated with the Romantic tradition. Polish conservatives, led by Count Czartoryski, had banked on the Russian Emperor Alexander I. Most of the duchy, less Pozna´n, was incorporated\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxvii\n\nwithin the Russian Empire in 1815 at Vienna in the Congress Kingdom. It was initially given considerable autonomy as long as Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovitch, Alexander’s brother, was viceroy, but this was insufficient to prevent the 1830–1831 Uprising. Its bloody suppression was followed by reprisals, mass exile to Siberia, and increasing repression during the reign of Czar Nicholas I. Emigration for political reasons also became widespread. Czartoryski set up what was almost a government-in-exile at the Hotel Lambert in Paris. Radicals established contacts with other revolutionaries in the struggle “for your freedom as well as ours.” It should be remembered that Polish Independence was later the issue on which the founding meeting of Karl Marx’s First International was called. The Great Emigration was also a profound intellectual and cultural movement marked by the great music of Fryderyk Chopin and the development of Romantic Messianism in the writings of Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Sl/ owacki. Although there were uprisings in Kraków in 1846 and in the Prussian Partition in 1848, the great anti-Russian revolution burst out in January 1863 and took more than a year to be suppressed. After 1864, the Poles in all three partitions tended to concentrate on “Organic Work.” This aimed to strengthen the economic and cultural resources of their national community and to resist the Russification and Germanization policies of the occupying powers. The building of railways and industrialization was most developed in the Prussian Partition. The revolutionary struggle was always most strongly nationalist there. The Prussian Government attacked the Roman Catholic Church in the Kulturkampf of the 1880s, encouraged German colonization through bodies such as the Hakata, and attempted to eradicate Polish language and educational facilities. The social conflict was most acute in Russian controlled areas. The rule of law was weak and industrialization patchier. The Polish gentry class in the eastern borderlands (kresy) was ruined by Czarist policy. This was, therefore, more fertile ground for the development of two extreme types of revolutionary Marxism; the internationalist type was propagated by Roz·a Luksemburg, while the fiercely patriotic independence strand of the Polish Socialist Party was epitomized by Józef Pil/sudski, who came from the déclassé gentry. Political, social, and religious conditions were at their best in Austrian Galicia, though economic development was not. Here the conservatives gained virtual autonomy after 1867 and defended Polish interests in the parliament in Vienna. Galicia thus produced the core of an experienced political and administrative class for independent Poland. It not only sheltered Poles from the more autocratically run partitions but also allowed Pil/sudski and others such as Wl/adysl/ aw Sikorski to organize riflemen’s clubs in the years before World War I.\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\nxxxviii •\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIndependent and Threatened Poland Much devastated by the war fought on its territory, independent Poland emerged out of the simultaneous defeat of all three of its occupiers. The defeat of the central powers and the political elimination of Russia after the 1917 revolutions permitted the establishment of an independent Polish government with Pil/ sudski as head of state in November 1918. But it took almost five years of diplomatic disputes and military conflicts before its frontiers were fully established and recognized. The Treaty of Versailles confirmed the Thirteenth Point of American President Woodrow Wilson’s war aims, which held that there should be an independent Poland with access to the Baltic Sea. But interallied disputes, especially British Prime Minister Lloyd George’s fear that Poland would become France’s satellite, led to the establishment of a Free City of Danzig. East Prussia remained German, with Poland obtaining access to the Baltic through the “corridor” that separated it from the rest of Germany. The Poles later constructed their own port at Gdynia. The final frontier with Germany emerged from Polish uprisings in Silesia and a plebiscite there as well as in Allenstein (Olsztyn) and Marienwerder. The eastern border that was confirmed by the Treaty of Riga of 1921 went well beyond the ethnic Polish confines recommended by Lord Curzon in the line named after him. The complicated and long, drawn out political and military conflicts between Ukrainians, Belarusans, Lithuanians, White and Soviet Russians, and Poles ended in 1920. The Poles not only repelled the Soviet advance on Warsaw in the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, but also occupied and gained considerable territory beyond the Curzon Line. Interwar Poland thus became only two-thirds ethnically Polish. Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) remained unreconciled to their territorial losses to Poland. Even relatively minor disputes such as those over Wilno (Vilnius) and Cieszyn also strained relations with Poland’s other neighbors, Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. Independent Poland became a parliamentary democracy very similar to the model of the Third French Republic. Its political and ethnic divisions produced a fragmented party system, which was faithfully reflected by the electoral system based on proportional representation. Governments were, therefore, broadly based but insecure and usually short lived. Political life was dominated by the conflict between Pil/sudski, who ceased to be head of state in 1922, and the National Democratic camp inspired by the nationalist ideologue Roman Dmowski. Their conflicts went to the heart of whether Poland should give autonomy to its national minorities or try to Polonize them. Pil/sudski, harking back to Jagiel/ l/onian conceptions, had hoped that some sort\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xxxix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxix\n\nof federal arrangement might produce a Trialist Polish-Lithuanian/BelarusanUkrainian state to balance Germany and to act as a buffer against Soviet Russia. But his schemes were somewhat chimerical at the time, while the rival concept of a unified Polish-dominated state won out on the domestic scene. The democratic system lasted until May 1926, when Pil/ sudski, fearing for his control over the Polish army, seized power in an armed coup d’état that caused some hundred deaths. He did not rule directly but through his Sanacja (Moral Reform) supporters, many of whom, particularly the colonels, became his ministers. His system of Guided Authoritarianism even kept up the pretense of coexistence with the Sejm until 1930, when opponents were arrested and imprisoned in the Brze´sc´ camp. Pil/ sudski, however, was increasingly aging, ill, and worn out. He failed to modernize the army, to rethink its strategy, or to appreciate the priority of the Nazi German over the Soviet Russian threat after Hitler came to power. His system, although served by able economists such as Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, barely began to industrialize Poland and to alleviate its problems of surplus rural population and dependency on the advanced capitalist economies that exploited its resources. Pil/ sudski’s foreign minister from 1932 onward, Colonel Józef Beck, gained time by signing nonaggression pacts with Germany and the USSR. But his brusque methods lost the confidence of an already irresolute French ally. France had been relied on since the signing of the political and military alliances of 1921, but it now sought a Soviet pact. When Pil/ sudski died in 1935, his system continued, with power being shared between the new army commander, Marshal Edward Rydz-S´migl/ y, Beck, and President Ignacy Mo´scicki. Beck was certainly unhelpful, but he cannot be blamed for the French failure to resist the remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936 or for Great Britain’s appeasement of Germany until after Munich. When Hitler turned on Poland in spring 1939, demanding the keys to the country’s security, the incorporation of Danzig, and the Corridor in the Reich, Beck spoke for the whole nation in defying him and in securing an Anglo-French guarantee. True to Pil/ sudski’s doctrine of the “Two Enemies,” to the end he refused to even consider a Soviet alliance for tactical purposes. The inevitable result in the age of realpolitik was the agreement between the two dictators, Hitler and Stalin. The RibbentropMolotov Pact of 23 August 1939, envisaging the “fourth partition” of Poland in its secret annex, allowed Germany to smash Poland in the first modern blitzkrieg, beginning on 1 September, while the USSR invaded and occupied eastern Poland from 17 September onward. It is impossible to overestimate the effect of World War II on the generation of Poles who lived through it. No rule of law existed for Poles in the\n\n03-129 01 Front\n\nxl •\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:28 PM\n\nPage xl\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nterritory incorporated within the Reich or those surviving hand-to-mouth, under conditions of continual repression within the remaining Germancontrolled General Gouvernement. The Holocaust of Jews and Gypsies (Roma) is well known, but the Polish intellectual and political elites were next in line for extermination. The general population only figured as slave labor in Nazi plans. Conditions were only marginally better in the Sovietoccupied areas. Massive deportations of more than a million Poles into the USSR’s heartland were matched by Stalin’s April–May 1940 massacre of about 21,000 prisoners of war and other internees in the Katy´n forest and other killing-grounds at Kharkov and Miednoje, near Tver, as well as in Ukrainian and Belarusan prisons. The details of how the Western Allies lied on this issue and abandoned their Polish government-in-exile ally after 1941, in order to give priority to the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany, are covered in the dictionary. Postwar great power deals at Yalta and Potsdam, which led to Poland’s new frontiers on the Oder-Neisse in the west and close to the Curzon Line in the east, are also discussed in the dictionary. These deals also condoned the de facto establishment of Communist rule within Poland, which was consolidated and turning into Stalinism by the time of the 1947 election. Poland under Communist Rule The currently popular argument that Soviet Communist rule was imposed upon Poland from outside is fundamentally true. But a much-delayed socioeconomic revolution was probably a postwar inevitability. The tragedy was that the postwar division of Europe and the Cold War meant that it should come from the hostile East, under Bolshevik Russian auspices, and not from the democratic West. Nevertheless, the reconstruction policies of 1945–1948 and the social, educational, and health reforms were nationally supported, despite their cynical use by the Communists in their drive to power. The details of the development of Communist Poland’s history are covered in the various dictionary entries, but it should be noted that it evolved through a number of different political forms that correspond to successive historical periods. Once the Communists had established their monopoly of power by late 1947, they moved on to implement classic Stalinization policies. The Polish Workers Party (PPR) was amalgamated forcibly with the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) to form the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) in December 1948. A massive industrialization program was accompanied by police terror.

He was highly influential, especially in cooperative movements before, and again after the Communist period, for his theory of nonstate socialism, adapting utopian anarchist traditions to Polish conditions. AGRICULTURE. Collectivization was never pressed very hard in Poland, even in the Stalinist period, with the result that more than 80 percent of the land was always farmed by small family-peasant holdings. Although Wl/ adysl/ aw Gomul/ ka revoked many of his initial concessions, Edward Gierek introduced pensions for private peasant farmers in the 1970s. By 2000, private farms occupied 57 percent of the country’s total area and 84 percent of the land in agricultural use. The large agricultural sector of about two million mainly small and inefficient family plots presented democratic Poland with its most serious economic and social problem. As late as 1995, 27 percent of the workforce (4.3 million) were still employed in agriculture, which contributed a mere 6.6 percent of the\n\n1\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\ngross domestic product (GDP). The real problem was that more than half of the plots were less than 5 hectares in size (20 percent of land tilled); the average was 6.7 hectares (only rising to 7.2 hectares by 2000), while a mere 3 percent were held to be fully viable (20 hectares or more), making up a fifth of the agricultural area. However, the countryside is now mechanized, with the previously ubiquitous horse and cart having almost completely vanished into folklore. They have been replaced by 1.3 million tractors (double the 1980 figure), combines, and other modern equipment. The prevailing external assumption that agricultural employment had to be slimmed down to about 800,000 to a million, however, met with strong opposition from Polish governments and from violent Poujadist peasants organized by Andrzej Lepper. Less than half of the holdings were, or could potentially become, viable and competitive within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework of the European Union (EU). The political will necessary to tackle this fundamental socioeconomic problem was strikingly absent during Jerzy Buzek’s government. The fundamental problems of restructuring and rural development and unemployment were sidestepped in the EU entry negotiations, in order to avoid the political backlash. EU assessments noted regularly the absence of any coherent strategy for both the agricultural and fisheries sectors. The EU also called for rapid improvements in the veterinary, food standard, and border inspection areas as well. It considered that while Poland had produced much of the required legislative harmonization, especially for sugar, fruits and vegetables, and, to a lesser extent, meat, the country was still incapable of managing the CAP. It lacked a paying agency and administrative control and milk quota management systems. Poland was faced in the final negotiation stage in 2002 with an EU Commission proposal that the introduction of CAP payments should be staggered over a 10-year transition period, starting at 25 percent in the first year of membership. The EU Commission also wanted to break the link between CAP payments and the quantity of production and to scale down the level of CAP subsidy by 20 percent over a seven-year period. The agricultural chapter was one of the last to be closed in 2002, as it awaited what turned out to be a last minute and fudged agreement on these issues between the existing members. Although Poland is agriculturally self-sufficient, food imports rocketed during the 1990s for reasons of quality and novelty, especially as dairy and milk production was initially unhygienic and primitive. The Agricultural Market Agency (ARR) was forced by peasant and political\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nALL-POLAND ALLIANCE OF TRADE UNIONS\n\n• 3\n\npressures to intervene to support prices, especially of pork, wheat, and milk. Low peasant incomes, together with the expensive cost of peasants’ social security and agricultural subsidies, thus cost about 9 percent of the state budget. Prospects for cereal, meat, and alcohol exports and fruit and vegetable food processing were brightest as the new millennium started, although total agricultural production declined after 1998. Poland’s potential for ecological farming could also be expected to partially counterbalance the EU’s need to curtail, not increase, agricultural production. On the other hand, Poland remained (1999) a major agricultural producer; it occupied the first position in the world in the production of rye, 5th in potatoes, 6th in beetroot and pork, 9th in milk, 13th in barley, and 14th in wheat. Overall there was a resigned feeling among Poland’s elites that, because agricultural restructuring and slimming down was inevitable, it would be best if it were carried out within a supporting EU framework. ALLIANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT/SOJUSZ LEWICY DEMOKRATYCZNE (SLD). Initially an umbrella political grouping animated by the Social-democracy of the Polish Republic (SdRP) from July 1991 onward in order to widen its appeal and to disassociate itself from its Communist (Polish United Workers’ Party [PZPR]) past. The SLD electoral alliance gained 60 Sejm seats in 1991 (13 groupings), 171 in 1993 (28 groupings), and 164 in 1997. In addition to the SdRP, its main components were the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) led by Piotr Ikonowicz, the Union of Polish Teachers (ZNP), the Socialist League of Polish Youth, and the Union of Women. The SdRP claimed to have completed its transformation into a normal west European type of social democratic party by assuming the name of the Alliance of the Democratic Left in 1999. This was designed to provide a more integrated organizational framework for its allied political forces. As the strongest party organization with the most united leadership and the second largest membership (about 60,000 claimed) in Poland, it gained a great success in the 2001 election; in alliance with the Labor Union (UP), it won 216 Sejm seats and three-quarters of the Senate seats.

The Jaruzelski regime started rebuilding the unions from the factory level upward and gradually developed them into a national federation, the OPZZ, by about 1985. This body, led by Alfred Miodowicz, was never as strong as the pre-1980 Communist unions (CRZZ) or Solidarity itself during 1980–1981. But it had a head start in membership terms on the latter and increasingly reflected the interests of its members both against Communist marketization initiatives in the late 1980s and the Round Table deal with Solidarity. The OPZZ, therefore, survived into the post-Communist era, establishing the Movement of the Working People (RLP) as its political arm. The latter’s chairman, Ewa Spychalska, succeeded Alfred Miodowicz as OPZZ leader from 1991 to 1996 and was, in turn, followed by Józef Wiaderny and Mieczysl/ aw Manicki. The OPZZ played a prominent role within the Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD) after 1993, electing numerous deputies and Senators. Like its Solidarity competitor, it faced the dilemma of reconciling support for the democratic and European aims of its political allies with those of expressing mass popular discontent with the social and economic costs of the modernizing transformation, especially factory closure and unemployment. / AW (1950– ).

The history of Polish architecture can be said to reach back some millennia because of important archeological discoveries. A wooden, early Stone Age house, for example, was discovered in Brze´s c´ Kujawski, while a whole defensive settlement from about 550 B.C. was uncovered at Biskupin. Pre-Romanesque (10th–11th centuries) remains of Ducal palaces with round chapels have survived in Gniezno, Kraków, Giecz, and other places. The flourishing of Romanesque culture from the mid-11th to the beginning of the 13th century has left its mark in such monumental churches, with richly decorated and polychromatic interiors as at Strzelno, Czerwi´nsk, and Kraków. The Gothic style (14–15th centuries) was introduced to Poland by religious orders, notably the Cistercians. They built numerous churches and abbeys (Wa˛chock and Sulejów), in which appeared the first crossbeam vaults and, after a while, red brick. The development of the Gothic style came at an opportune political and economic moment in Poland and was popularized by royal courts, especially by Kazimierz III (the Great), as well as by burghers. Whole towns were built on a regularly shaped layout with defensive walls, town squares, and town halls, such as the famous one in Toru´n, which dates back to the late 13th century. The building in which the Jagiel/ l/ onian University was established in Kraków in 1364 has survived till the present day.\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n6 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nThe Renaissance style in Polish architecture appeared with the arrival of Italian artists in the early 16th century. King Zygmunt I (the Old), a great patron of the arts, had the burned-out Wawel Castle in Kraków rebuilt according to the plans of Francis the Florentine and Bartolomeo Berrecci. The castle’s courtyard was surrounded with magnificent galleries, and the masterpiece of the Polish Renaissance, Zygmunt’s Chapel, was built at the same time (1519–1533). The aristocracy and the rich gentry built their own chapels and churches on the royal model to house their mausoleums and patronized both Polish and Italian sculptors to adorn them. Among the magnificent Renaissance residences the castles of Pieskowa Skal/ a and Baranów and the town halls of Sandomierz and Zamo´s c´ should be mentioned. The characteristic feature of the Renaissance style was its richly decorated walls, screening comb-shaped roofs, as in the Pozna´n, Toru´n, and Sandomierz town halls. With the passing of time, the style adapted native Polish mannerisms, such as excessive decoration and neglect of strict architectural rules. The beginnings of the Baroque appeared in Poland toward the end of the 16th century in such Jesuit churches as Nie´swiez·, Kalisz, and Kraków. The Baroque style of the time is best represented by the Royal Castle in Warsaw (1600–1619) and in the work of the celebrated architect Giovanni (Jan) Trevano. Warsaw had by that time become the national capital, although Kraków, with its numerous royal and magnates’ palaces, remained an important cultural center. Monuments, such as Zygmunt’s Column in Warsaw, made their first appearance at this time. The mannerism begun by Renaissance architecture continued in the form of excessively colored stuccoes, sparkling marbles, and monumental colonnades, as typified by the castle in Krasiczyn. All this reflected the megalomania of the dominant Sarmatian ideology, which declared the racial superiority of the feudal ruling class. In church architecture, the model Counter-Reformation influence became the Jesuits’ Roman church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kraków, and the fortified monastery of Cze ˛ stochowa was also built at this time. The Baroque in Poland was closely connected with the country’s rebuilding after the Swedish invasions. It introduced an important architectural shift from the earlier emphasis on military defense to the elegant and extravagant style best typified by Jan Sobieski’s palace at Wilanów outside Warsaw (1681–1692), the work of Augustus Locci. The most outstanding Baroque architect who introduced classical features was the Dutchman, Tylman Gameren, who designed the Krasi´nski Palace in Warsaw (1680–1699), Saint Anne’s church in Kraków, and the Nieborów Palace.\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\n• 7\n\nThe decline of Sarmatianism and the gradual introduction of French models led to a lighter architectural touch with greater finesse. New residences, such as those designed by Jan Zygmunt Deybel in Bial/ ystok and Jan Henryk Klemm in Radzy´n Podlaski, adopted the classical Versailles type of layout for their gardens. After 1760, the search for simpler forms drawn from classical models, especially of Ancient Greece and Rome, became widespread. The fine arts flourished to an exceptional degree under the patronage of King / azienki Gardens in Warsaw, deStanisl/ aw Augustus Poniatowski. The L signed by Dominik Merlini and Jan Christian Kamsetzer, is a typical example of Classicism; but one could also mention numerous other schools, hospitals, and theaters planned by such notable architects as Szymon Bogumil/ Zug, Stanisl/ aw Zawadzki, Piotr Aigner, and Antonio Corazzi. Toward the end of the 18th century the typical Polish country house, a single floor construction with a columned porch, crystallized. Huge urban transformations began to take place along with the construction of great public buildings, such as the National Theater. The style was generally dominated by historical forms, especially the neo-Gothic, represented by Józef Dzieko´nski, as well as the neo-Renaissance, practiced by Henryk Markoni. The eclectic result in architecture of the early capitalist period was typically the large tenement house for rent with a small backyard. The 20th century started off with the Secessionist style, represented by the Old Theater of Tadeusz Stryje´nski and the Fine Arts Association building of Franciszek Ma˛czy´nski. In their search for the essential features of the Polish model, architects drew their inspiration from the folk arts, especially the highland style of Zakopane and the already established Polish “manor house” mode. In urban planning the Kraków architects drew on English “Garden City” models, while their Warsaw colleagues tended toward simplified Classical forms, such as the finance house of Jan Heurich or the department store designed by Franciszek Lilpop and Karol Jankowski. After the regaining of independence, Polish architecture faced new tasks determined by social needs. With the passage of time, especially during the 1930s, new trends began to dominate. A so-called school of modern architecture emerged, using new concrete and steel materials, which produced functional and straightforward buildings without any particular decoration. Its leading figures were E. Norwerth, A. Dygat, and T. Tol/ wi´nski, who designed the National Museum in Warsaw. Urbanism and architecture faced a huge task in rebuilding the devastated country after World War II. Whole cities such as Warsaw,\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n8 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nARCISZEWSKI, TOMASZ (1877–1955)\n\nGda´nsk, and Wrocl/ aw lay in ruins, as did many of the factories and much of the communications network and even the countryside. The pearls of the Polish architectural heritage, such as the Old Towns of Warsaw and Gda´nsk, were eventually rebuilt in their original form, as were the historic parts of other cities, such as Lublin and Wrocl/ aw. A decade of postwar “Socialist Realism” meant that new housing developments were often modeled on the functional Soviet Stalinist example of large tenement blocks, although only one towering ice-cake skyscraper, the Palace of Culture, was built in Stalin’s name in the center of Warsaw. After 1956, large suburbs were developed with geometrically laid out roads and squares. Whole new towns, such as Nowe Tychy and the iron and steel city of Nowa Huta outside Kraków, arose. Among the great achievements of this period should be included the major road systems, / azienkowska and East West routes, and the development of such as the L ˙ oliborz Orchards, in the large new suburbs, such as Kol/ o, Praga III, and Z capital city. After Stalinism, Polish architects and urban planners succeeded in marrying the best of their native traditions with Soviet as well as Western models in what is widely acknowledged to have been an adventurous, and by no means unsuccessful, exercise in building and civilizing the modern city. The bulk of the building effort, understandably, went into new housing, factories, and other social and cultural construction, but many historic churches were also rebuilt as well as a few entirely modern ones in Sochaczew, Wl/ adysl/ awowo, and Tarnów. Postwar Polish architects also achieved recognition in international competitions and left their mark in projects in foreign cities from Lima (where Ryszard Mal/ achowski was the main architect), Madrid, Dublin, Central London, Geneva, and San Francisco (Central Square) to Raleigh, North Carolina (the “Paraboleum”). One should also note that the Communist system was very fond of monumental sculpture, especially in memory of working-class heroes and, above all, the World War II experience. It patronized and gave full rein in its public monuments, such as the Westerplatte Memorial, to the talents of such outstanding sculptors as Xawery Dunikowski, Jerzy Badura, Witold Ce˛ckiewicz, Jerzy Jarmuszkiewicz, and Julian Pal/ ka. ARCISZEWSKI, TOMASZ (1877–1955). Polish Socialist Party (PPS) politician. Arciszewski was minister in the first two governments of independent Poland, 1918–1919, and Sejm deputy 1919–1935. As PPS chairman he opposed the Communists’ united front policies during the 1930s and the more pro-Soviet tack of Wl/ adysl/ aw Sikorski and\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nART\n\n• 9\n\nStanisl/ aw Mikol/ ajczyk during World War II. He was prime minister of the London Government-in-Exile, from November 1944 to July 1945, after Mikol/ ajczyk returned to Poland to participate in the Provisional Government. AREA AND TERRAIN. In 2000, Poland was territorially the world’s 69th largest state and the ninth largest state in Europe (including European Russia and the Ukraine); its area of 312,685 square kilometers (322,577 square kilometers, if coastal waters are included) is roughly the total size of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. The bulk of Poland’s surface area is composed of a vast plain, with 91 percent less than 300 meters in altitude and the average level being 173 meters. But this conceals wide variations; the Gda´nsk-Elbla˛ g depression lies below sea level, while large areas of the south rise above 500 meters. Geographers describe the Polish terrain as being composed of four distinct belts. First, there is the low and sandy Baltic coastal plain. To its south and east there is a much broader region of undulating forests and picturesque lakes in Pomerania and Mazuria. The central lowlands of Greater Poland, Silesia, Mazovia (Mazowsze), and Podlasie, make up more than half of Poland’s territory. This flat heartland has generally poor and sandy soils, except for some black earth patches in the west. Poland’s name is derived from this region; pole means field in Polish, and its original Slav inhabitants were the Polanie, or “peoples of the fields.” Last come the southern uplands, rising up to the Sudetenland and heavily forested Carpathian Mountains. See also TOURISM. ART. Polish art and architecture have both been influenced by Western models, since the adoption of Christianity in the 10th century. Among the earliest milestones are Wit Stwosz (about 1447–1533), who sculpted and painted the magnificent wooden altar in the Marian Church in Kraków. Renaissance painting, however, did not flourish to the same extent as its sculpture and architecture. An outstanding representative of the former is Stanisl/ aw Samostrzelnik (about 1485–1541), a noted portrait and miniature painter. This style was succeeded by the developed Baroque of the late 17th-century period of rebuilding after the Swedish invasions. The burghers who had played such an important role in developing Gothic and Renaissance were now impoverished and replaced completely as patrons by magnates and the church. Decorative painting flourished in the splendid interiors of the palaces, churches, and monasteries of the time, as did portraiture, including tomb portraits.\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n10 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nART\n\nThe real development of the fine arts took place during the Classical period, especially under the patronage of King Stanisl/ aw Augustus Poniatowski. Portrait painting was increasingly replaced by historical painting, as in the work of M. Bocciarelli. The celebrated Bernardo Bellotto, better known as Canaletto, produced panoramic views of the Warsaw of his time. Zygmunt Vogel specialized in watercolors, while Jan Piotr Norblin and his pupil, Aleksander Orl/ owski, produced scenes from the life of small towns and the countryside on canvas. Nineteenth-century painting assumed more national and patriotic characteristics as a result of the defeat of the 1831 and 1863 Uprisings and life under the Partitions. With the early development of capitalism, the middle classes came to the fore and patronized both the large and miniature forms of portrait painting, as typified by Jakub Simmler. Romanticism in painting came somewhat later than in literature, although it demonstrated typically Polish features. Its subjects emphasized strong national and patriotic feelings and the simple Polishness of the countryside as well as a return to an idealized past of Polish independence and greatness, especially during the Middle Ages. Piotr Michal/owski, who achieved a wider European reputation, was a bit of an exception, as his topics were drawn from the Napoleonic Wars, scenes from everyday life, and peasant portraits. A new current of Social-Realism, dealing with the life of the oppressed classes, also developed as the century wore on. The main representatives of Realism were Wojciech Gerson, Franciszek Kostrzewski, Józef Szermentowski, and Aleksander Kotsis. Aleksander Gierymski (Jewess with Lemons, The Trumpets, and The Peasant’s Coffin) also flourished during the heyday of Realism, as did Józef Chel/ mo´nski (The Storks and Indian Summer). The most outstanding mid-19th-century painter was Jan Matejko. He depicted many of the major scenes in Poland’s history, notably Rejtan, The Union of Lublin, Batory before Pskow, The Battle of Grunwald, and The Prussian Homage, on large canvases. His work is characterized by the originality of the composition and the historically accurate and convincing nature of the detail. In totally different forms, Artur Grottger excelled in drawings and Juliusz Kossak produced a series of magnificent watercolors of scenes of Poland gentry life. The direct opposite of Realism was Impressionism, which developed in France and won over such converts as Wl/ adysl/ aw Podkowi´nski and Leon Wyczól/ kowski and also partially influenced Jan Stanisl/ awski and Olga Bozna´nska. The final decade of the 19th century saw a turn toward the fantastic and the appearance of the Symbolist School (which, as in literature, was\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nBALCEROWICZ, LESZEK (1947– )\n\n• 11\n\nalso known as Secessionism or Young Poland). The most famous example of this approach was the poet and painter Stanisl/ aw Wyspia´nski. The currents originating out of Young Poland lasted until the 1930s, in the work of the most outstanding interwar painter, Tadeusz Makowski, whose favorite subjects were children (The Cobbler, The Country Yard, and The Miser). The next new school was that of Colorism, developed by the pupils of Józef Pankiewicz, a professor at the Kraków Fine Arts Academy, notably Zygmunt Waliszewski, Jan Cybis, Eugeniusz Eibish, and Hanna Rudzka-Cybisowa. Painting, as did the other arts, saw a heated debate during 1955–1960 about the philosophical bases of contemporary painting. Abstract painting (“without a subject”) became more popular, originally in geometrical forms (H. Staszewski and Jonas Stern) and later nongeometrical forms (Tadeusz Kantor). At the same time an important sub-current in Polish painting emerged with Primitivists, self-taught painters like Teofil Ociepka and Nikifor. The contemporary period, from the 1970s onward, has been marked by unceasing experimentation and eclecticism. Work has represented various directions in painting, including a reborn “Figuralism,” as demonstrated by neo-Expressionists, such as J. Narzy´nski, A. Moz´ ejko, and R. Gierszewski. “Realist” approaches also continued as shown in the paintings of Juliusz and Helena Krajewski.\n\n–B– BABIUCH, EDWARD (1927– ). Communist politician. Babiuch was Edward Gierek’s main political lieutenant during the 1970s, first as a Polish United Workers’ Party (PZPR) Central Committee secretary (1970–1980), and then as prime minister (February–August 1980). He was disgraced because of his responsibility for the 1980 crisis. Gierek later, in his memoirs, accused Babiuch of conspiring against him. BAIRD, TADEUSZ (1928–1981). Baird was an influential modern composer, noted for his three symphonies, concertos, and choral work. He also established the postwar “Warsaw Autumn” music festival, which became a significant event in the cultural life of Poland and its capital. BALCEROWICZ, LESZEK (1947– ). An academic economist at the Main School of Planning and Statistics (SGPiS) in Warsaw from 1970\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n12 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nBALCEROWICZ, LESZEK (1947– )\n\nto 1989. His radical marketization and industrial restructuring proposals were rejected by the government during 1978–1981. He became one of Solidarity’s economic advisers and was associated with “Siec´,” the Network of Leading Workplaces, established in April 1981. Balcerowicz emerged as the post-Communist economic supremo, holding the posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance from October 1989 to autumn 1991. He developed the plan named after him, which stabilized the currency domestically and checked inflation at the cost of growing austerity and unemployment during the first two post-Communist governments of Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. Balcerowicz was elected chairman of the new Freedom Union (UW) in April 1995 and led the party until 2000. He became deputy prime minister and finance minister again, in the government formed by Jerzy Buzek in October 1997 until 2000. Balcerowicz is identified as the most determined political exponent of the “big bang” strategy of incorporating Poland within the global capitalist economy as quickly as possible. His initial tight monetary policies provoked decreases of about a third in output and the standard of living, leading to strikes and social unrest. Balcerowicz’s policies got rid of the Black Market, especially in the Polish currency, the zl/oty. A functioning consumer market was established, where prices replaced the massive queuing and other dislocations that had characterized this sector since the mid-1970s. His admirers argue that these achievements gained Western investment and International Monetary Fund support, especially over debt-restructuring and credit requests. They were held to have laid the basis for the country’s further economic transformation away from the Communist command economy. But the timescale for privatization, industrial restructuring, and the development of an enterprise economy with the appropriate capitalist infrastructure was extended by Balcerowicz’s successors, notably Grzegorz Kol/ odko, who favored economic growth. From 1997 to 2000, Balcerowicz’s attempts as deputy premier and minister of finance in Jerzy Buzek’s government to maintain financial balance were challenged by the social unrest caused by industrial and agricultural restructuring and pensions and health service reforms prior to European Union (EU) entry. Balcerowicz was nominated as chairman of the independent National Bank of Poland in December 2000 and, again, acted as the guardian of a strong currency and of tight monetary policy. These policies brought him into renewed conflict with Leszek Miller’s government, especially after Kol/ odko became finance minister again in July 2002.\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nBANKING\n\n• 13\n\nBALTIC SEA. The Baltic Sea forms Poland’s northern border, and the country has had about 440 kilometers of coastline since 1945. Poland has, however, been cut off from the sea at various times in its history, notably by the Teutonic Knights and by Prussian expansion during the partition period. In the 17th century, Poland also struggled for control of the Baltic with Sweden, when Poland’s control of the Baltic coastline extended all the way to present-day Latvia, or what historically has been called Inflanty. In the 20th century, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s Thirteenth Point, guaranteeing an independent Poland “safe and secure access” to the sea, was only partially fulfilled by the Treaty of Versailles. Germany kept East Prussia, and Danzig (in German; Gda´nsk in Polish) became a free city, which fell under Nazi control in the 1930s, while the so-called Polish Corridor to the Baltic separated Germany from East Prussia. Since 1945, Poland has returned to its original Piast situation, and is now clearly a Baltic-based power with strong Scandinavian connections. The Baltic is of recent geological origins and is a fairly shallow and freshwater sea. Despite its enclosed character, it is divided into a number of basins and also has some deep bays and numerous islands. The sea temperature ranges from freezing in winter in its northern parts to a maximum of about 18 degrees centigrade in its southern Polish sections, but its climate is also marked by windy and stormy conditions. Fishing is mainly of eel, herring, and cod and is carried out in the numerous smaller secondary harbors such as Kol/ obrzeg, Koszalin, and Sl/ upsk. Poland’s main ports are in Gda´nsk, Gdynia (constructed interwar to circumvent German control), and S´winouj´scie, the port for Szczecin at the mouth of the River Oder. Their dockyards played crucial political roles during the Polish People’s Republic (PRL), notably in the strikes and confrontations with the Communist system that produced Solidarity in 1980–1981. The Gda´nsk shipyard fell on hard times after 1987, and its closure was a long, drawn out, and deeply emotional and politically controversial issue. The other two yards prospered initially during the Third Republic, until the privatized Szczecin yard went bankrupt in 2002. One of the unfortunate consequences of communism was the environmental pollution of the Baltic, in terms of both industrial waste and sewage, which is only now being tackled.

The Central\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n14 •\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nBANKING\n\nBank of Poland and numerous state-owned banks competed in 1938 with no less than 27 private joint-stock banks, 20 banking houses, 19 credit funds, 353 communal savings funds, 975 local credit and savings societies, and almost 6,000 credit societies. The Communist command economy in its Stalinist form originally reduced banks to mere bookkeeping and plan control agencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP) was controlled by the Ministry of Finance, which took its orders directly from the leading party-state bodies. Commercial operations were heavily centralized in the following three banks: the Commercial Bank serviced foreign trade, the Bank PKO handled domestic and foreign currency accounts, and the Food Economy Bank served State Farms (Pa´nstwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne, PGR) and the limited socialized agricultural sector. The latter also supervised the operations of about 1,500 cooperative banks catering to the needs of the predominant private farming sector. This system was tinkered with at various times, but the important 1981 reform gave the National Bank some independence from the government. It also allowed for the creation of independent and self-financing joint-stock banks with foreign capital participation. In practice, little was done because of the political stalemate, although independent export development and state savings banks as well as some commercial banks were established from 1986 onward. Post-Communist Poland made an early, and probably the most ambitious, start in Eastern Europe under Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Leszek Balcerowicz to produce an efficient and modern banking sector to service its rapid moves toward economic restructuring and privatization. The number of banks increased dramatically. Despite some failures and scandals (notably the Art-B case), about 100 national banks were functioning successfully by 1993, many branches of foreign banks had been established, and the main state banks were being transformed into jointstock companies. The number of cooperative banks stabilized at 1,394, compared with 78 commercial banks (1995). New institutions such as a National Clearing House and a “telebank” also emerged. A balanced equilibrium was reached by 1995, when the state share of bank capital fell to 50 percent and it controlled 24 banks compared with a foreign holding of 30 percent, which controlled another 24, while Polish capital owned 36 banks. The state commercial banks that had broken away from the NBP after 1986, therefore, faced growing competition, and the nine major regional firms were privatized between 1993 and 1998. German and Italian bank holdings also accelerated to such an extent that foreign capital’s share was estimated at two-thirds by 1999.\n\n03-129 A-J\n\n6/24/03\n\n2:24 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nBARTOSZEWSKI, WL/ ADYSL/ AW (1922– )\n\n• 15\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000, the NBP concentrated on the traditional steering and oversight functions of a central bank under Hanna GronkiewiczWaltz, who exercised tight control over the currency, as did her successor, Leszek Balcerowicz. The new financial system also encouraged a dramatic expansion of bank accounts, check transactions, credit cards, and mortgage loans. The opening up of the banking and insurance sectors to foreign firms was accelerated by Jerzy Buzek’s government, which privatized the PEKAO and Western Banks and started issuing mortgage bank licenses. The Banking Act, which came into force in January 1999, also allowed foreign banks to establish branches in Poland. More significantly, it strengthened the independence of the NBP, while devolving some of its powers, such as setting the interest rate to the Council on Monetary Policy (RPP). BARTEL, KAZIMIERZ (1882–1941). A Lwów Polytechnic mathematician and professor who became a Sanacja politician. He was a minister in various posts during the 1920s and prime minister on three occasions (1926–1930). His main function was to steer Poland through the partially free political period following Marshal Józef Pil/ sudski’s coup d’état in 1926. The system subsequently became much more authoritarian from 1930 onward. He was murdered by the Nazi occupiers. BARTOSZCZE, ROMAN (1946– ). This Rural Solidarity activist became a Polish Peasant Party (PSL-Wilanów faction) leader and Sejm deputy in 1989. The following year he became the chairman of the reunited PSL and the Peasant Party’s candidate in the presidential election, gaining a disappointing 7.15 percent of the vote. Bartoszcze eventually lost a power struggle for control of the PSL with the successors to the United Peasant Party (ZSL) strand of the Communist period, led by Roman Jagieli´nski.
