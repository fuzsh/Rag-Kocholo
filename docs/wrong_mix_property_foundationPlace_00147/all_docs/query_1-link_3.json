Despite the new place of work, Timofey will not change his location and will remain in Cyprus, where Awem founder and CEO Oleg Rogovenko also works now.\n\nIn conversation with App2Top.ru Fadeev said that he just wanted to stay in Cyprus and at the same time return to the gaming industry. He met Awem “on the island”.\n\nIn his new position, Timofey will be engaged in relations with platforms, establishing processes within the company, developing new directions and new partnerships in it, and will be responsible for building the Awem brand.\n\nIn the near future, Fadeev will also devote special attention to the studio’s new game — Puzzle Heart. “We place big bets on the project and are confident in its success,” Timofey notes.\n\nPuzzle Heart\n\nAwem Games is a Belarusian company that started as a developer of casual premium games.
