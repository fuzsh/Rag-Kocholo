        "text": "Prominent Prussians\n\nNICOLAUS COPERNICUS\n\nNicolaus Copernicus, the great astronomer who changed the perception of our world and laid the foundation for todayâs space science, was born on Baltic people land - the Prusai land of the 19th February 1473 in Torun.\n\nHis family came from a wealthy Torun bourgeois class. German nationalism of a bygone era tried to assign him, beyond any doubt, to the nation of the Germanic race. With the fall of the German fascism, so far they left Copernicus in peace.\n\nWith regard to the belonging of Copernicus, his orientation as well as the contacts, has been always with the Polish side.\n\nSo, it was like that with his parents. Copernicus never showed and did not leave any evidence of German descent. Confirmation of the above, his first education was at university of Sciences in Krakow, as well as its subsequent involvement in Olsztyn, while defending there the castle against the German knights.\n\nBut Copernicus was not a Pole. By todayâs standards, since he was born in Torun, acted in Prusai land, was among the Prusai people, therefore automatically ought to be regarded as Prus. Should that be denied, then the existence of Prusai people as such should not be recognized.\n\nPolandâs crown worthily considered pro Polishness of Copernicus, in 1537 the Polish King, he staged his nomination for a bishop of Warmia.\n\nMuch earlier such support for Copernicus to the offices of Warmian canon came from the Prusai, an example is to be a Prus Andrew Klec the already influential Warmian canon.\n\nIt was noted that even in those days to promote the position of the offices, the support came from the same class of people, blood kinship or a national origin.\n\nIt should be emphasized, that the most active support for the post of the canon at Frombork was none other than Andrew Klec of noble lineage. The count did not come here with the same affinity or class origin of Copernicus, and could only be the same of national identity. Following behind this, both were combined in deep friendship.\n\nThe discovery of the crypt in the cathedral of Frombork with the remains of Nicolaus Copernicus and genetic studies of hair, found at university of Uppsala allowed not only to establish the true remains but also the determination of the Nicolaus Copernicus genetic code. According to these studies it was determined, that his genetic haplogroup is R1b1b2. In the past the results of genetic tests carried among the Prusai descendants, shown that this is the Haplogroup among the ancient inhabitants of the Pomesania land. The proto Celtic haplogroup that derives from the Gothic peoples, precisely the Gepedoios.\n\nAll this does not mean that we should exclude him from the Polish identity, from among Polish society, today it is nothing less than four million are descendants of the Prusai, who never accepted the German enslavement and voluntarily chose orientation of Polish culture.\n\nJABLONOWSKI FAMILY\n\nAleksander Jan Jablonowski\n\nJablonowski coat of arms Prus III.

His heroic resistance against the confederation of Partitioning Parliament is considered to be one of the last positive sample of application Liberum Veto.\n\nSon of a wealthy landowner Dominic Reytan, Chamberlain Novgorod and Teresa WoÅodkowiczowa of Minsk. Brother Michael, an earthly Novgorod writer. Grandson Michael (d. 1706), treasurer of mozyrew, with his father was a client Radziwill family.\n\nAt the first session of the Parliament April 19, 1773, together with Samuel Korsak and Stanislaw Bohuszewicz opposed the establishment of the Diet of the Confederation under the leadership of Adam Poninski, for the approval of the Treaty of the partition of Poland. His position was in line with the instructions received by the election of a deputy to his council in Nowogrodek: Defend all Poland at the risk of lives and the property. Relied on the fact that universals royal parliament convened off and Speakerâs staff alternata was attributed to the Lithuanian province. Respected the rules of strict legalism, not seeking to break the session, the request to put forward as the only choice of Speaker. Resistance of Reytan supported Korsak, the other members of the Lithuanian and some Crownâs (mainly Leczyca). He took a staff in the hands, that was prepared for the Speaker of the Lithuanian Confederation, and sat down on a Marshal stool stating that it may be the same as the self-appointed marshal PoniÅski, leading him to the resignation of the last of the presidential place. April 20 brought to the city an act of confederation and established the courts, before which Reytan was sued. In the face of the failure of the court action against Reytan confederation sentenced him in absentia judgment (condemned) as a rioter of universal peace, and rebel against the country for criminal penalties and confiscation of goods.\n\nApril 21 by order of Poninski the Warsaw city did not accept the manifesto of Reytan and Korsak was against unauthorized bringing an action against Reytan. Partition Powers gave a note demanding parliamentary room empty, but Reytan, Korsak and Bohuszewicz have not left. Trying to keep the audience with members who after the announcement of breaking the session went to the exit, Reytan stood up in the doorway with outspread hands, pleading for the love of the God and the country, fell to the ground crying out to trample his body. Members passed him by lying. April 22 Reytan physically and mentally exhausted after 36 hours stay without food left the parliamentary room. He received a written assurance from MPâs partition powers, that not to be repressed and that condemnation on him will be erased. Reytan went to the patronage of the Prussian General Rupert Scipio von Lentulus, who gave him protection of Prussian Hussars, which later went to his assistance in the capital.\n\nAfter the Partition Sejm, Rejtan went to Lithuania and according to the family tradition fell into insanity as a result of which 8 August 1780 he committed suicide. Did not set up a family.\n\nProbably took his life in his native Hruszowce by injuring with the glass. The remains of Tadeusz Reytan were discovered during the Second Republic in 1930 in a brick walled grave in a place called \"Under the hornbeam\", located near the court, which was pointed by local residents. Polish scientists among them Kazimierz Stolyhwo anthropologist and historian StanisÅaw Lorentz confirmed the authenticity of the fact that the place was of burial and the remains of Tadeusz Reytan. According to historian George Michalski study of the remains in the Hruszowka in 1930 did not lead to a clear conclusion that they are Tadeusz Rejtanâs.\n\nShortly after his death, spread in Poland form of his worship. Reytan portraits appeared on numerous prints as a symbol of a true patriot.

Until today there is a Dabrowski chapel at Radzyn and their coffin boards presenting portraits are in the parish church of Radzyn.\n\nJan Henryk Dabrowski is a descendant of an impoverished part of the family settled in Lublin region, with coat of arms \"Virgo\", as his ancestors at Culm. His ancestor Janusz of Szczuplinek a knight, was a participant in the Battle of Grunwald with the Culmland banner.\n\nJan Henryk Dabrowski, born August 2, 1755, in the Pierzchowcu by Raba Malopolska died in June 6, 1818, in Winna Gora in Wielkopolska) - Polish general, freemason, initiated into Freemasonry in Italy, the son of Colonel John Michael Dabrowski and Sophia Maria von Lettow.

It is demonstrated by the genetic tests done by the living family descendant. Also, archives material allows to confirm it. Sklodo whether Ausklode was a popular name among the Prusai. Part of the family Sklodowski used the nickname Windyki. Windyk son of Obizor, Prince of Prusai, from whom derive family of Nienaltowscy. Nests of these families: Sklody and Nienalty next to each other, share a common history. Were founded after the Grunwald victory. Settled there the descendants of the Prusai knights who escaped from the East Prussia Teutonic aggression. Initially, after 1243 settled in the land between Czersk, Grojec and Tarczyn. After Grunwald victory, using the privileges of the princes of Mazovia, moved to the ground, of Nurski, establishing Sklody and Nienalty.\n\nSklodowski were legitimated by Heroldy of Polish Kingdom. Presented false identification of Sklodowski Seweryn, heir of Rzasnik with no descendants. Ascribed Dolega coat of arms. Heroldii practice was to assign an unknown family crest, coat of arms of the family of a similar or identical name. Sklodowski assigned Dolega coat of arms, which is Sklotowscy stamping. Another part of the family Sklodowski also be inferred from a false crest JastrzÄbiec ancestor. Genuine coat of arms of Sklodowski remains unknown, although they were probably the Prus coat of arms. A similar situation occurred in Nienaltowski assigned Nalecz coat of arms, while in 1500 it was the Prus coat of arms .\n\nFamily of Maria Sklodowska:\n\nJohn Sklodowska-Paluch de Sklody-Piotrowice\n\nÂ before 1726\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And\n\nJacob before 1759\n\n1740 Kunigunde Godlewska\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And\n\nJan * 1743 1803\n\nBarbara Nowakowska\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And\n\nUrban * 1771 before 1832\n\nÂ And\n\nJozef * 1804 1882\n\n1832 Salomea Sagtynska\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And\n\nWladyslaw * 1832 1902\n\n1860 Marianna Boguska\n\nAnd\n\nMaria-Salomea * 1867 1934\n\n1895 Pierre Curie\n\nTrautmann.
