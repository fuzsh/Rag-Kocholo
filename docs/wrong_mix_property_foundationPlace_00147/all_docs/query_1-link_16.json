        "text": "The Belarusian-Russian University is an interstate institution of higher education of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\n\nWe have come a long way of formation and development. The University has a half-century history. It was founded as a Machine Building Institute; today it has become a major scientific and educational complex.\n\nEvery year more than 1,000 young specialists graduate from the University - competent professionals with a high level of education, capable of mastering innovative technologies and new equipment. Our graduates are among the most versatile and mobile professionals holding senior positions in different companies and organizations.\n\nThe University offers a variety of programs in the field of secondary, higher, postgraduate and continuing professional education. About 20 years ago we were the first in the region to open the Continuing Education and Professional Development Institute. Today, we are the first to offer distance education in the regional market of the educational services.\n\nThe University continues to work on creating scientific and industrial laboratories that provide close cooperation between higher education and production.Creation of a unified system \"science - education - production\" ensures dynamics of key components of the pedagogical system and allows adapting general theoretical and general professional training of future specialists for promising areas of innovative production.\n\nDeveloping cooperation with foreign universities, our University seeks to create favorable conditions for export of educational services and increase the number of undergraduate and graduate students from the CIS and other foreign countries. Today export of educational services has grown considerably, and the geographic origin of our undergraduates, master students and postgraduates has widened as well: China, Iran, Syria, Israel, Turkmenistan, etc.\n\nHowever, the University is represented, first of all, by its people, a team united by one goal. The University takes pride in its highly qualified teachers and researchers, and established scientific schools. Today, recognized schools in the following areas of science and engineering operate at the University: mathematical modeling of engineering systems, control systems for motion modes of wheeled vehicles, metal and welding technologies, machine elements manufacturing technologies, mechanical transmissions of new types, as well as intelligent systems for quality control of products for machine building production, etc. In our work we have adopted as an axiom the idea that the success of creating an innovative economy and the knowledge society depends largely on the integration of education, science and industry. Today, this idea is not disputed; it is a key principle of educational policy in most developed countries, including both the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\n\nThe quality management system of the Belarusian- Russian University was developed, implemented and certified. The Lyceum, the College and the University were the first in the country to be certified. It resulted in a continuing training of specialists: \"Lyceum - College - University - Continuing Education and Professional Development Institute» in accordance with the international standard 150 9001:2008, thus improving the effectiveness of educational, methodological, scientific, pedagogical and innovative activities in the University.\n\nIn its activities the University tends to use the greatest achievements accumulated by higher education institutions of these two countries over many years.\n\nThe Belarusian-Russian University offers the foreign citizens the following educational services:\n\nStudying at the preparatory department to learn Russian and to prepare for the entrance on the basic courses on a technical or economic section. The studied disciplines are the Russian language, mathematics, IT , adaptation to training, Economics and Natural Sciences (for economic faculty); Physics and Chemistry (for technical faculty). The period of education is 1 year. The fee is $1300 per year.\n\nStudying at technical and economic faculties of the University at a full-time department or a part-time department (if a foreign citizen has a previous education at the level of comprehension school – not less than 10 classes). After the graduation a student gets a diploma of higher education of the state international standard. The period of education is 4-5 years (part-time department -5-6 years). The fee of full-time department is $2200 per year and the fee of part-time department is $1300 per year.\n\nStudying at Ma course (Master of Arts) for technical or economic faculty (for those who have a higher education at the bachelor or expert level). The period of education is from 1 to 2 years. The cost of education is $2500-2700 per year depending on the specialty.\n\nStudying at postgraduate course at full-time department or a part-time department (for those who has Master degree) The period of education is 3 years for a full-time department and 4 years for a part-time department.\n\nRussian language courses and individual training in Russian (any level of education). The period of education is defined individually. The cost depends on the number of students in a group (till 5 persons).\n\nThe Belarusian-Russian University is not only a leading scientific and educational institution, but also a cultural center of the region. In its extracurricular activities the University pursues such priorities as patriotism, ideological, moral, spiritual and aesthetic values; besides it pays a lot of attention to sports activities.\n\nMuch work on the implementation of state youth policy is done by the University organizations: NGO “Belarusian Republican Youth Union” and the Students' Trade Union Organization. The University Students' Council also carries out remarkable work.\n\nThe students of the University are involved in volunteer movement as well. The volunteer clubs “From Heart to Heart” and “The Spring of Mercy” provide support to the patients of the Psychoneurological Hospital (Soltanovka, Mogilev district), the children of Mogilev Orphanage No 1 and Mogilev hospice, World War II veterans, and the disabled children of the Belarusian Association of Assistance to Children and Young People with Disabilities.\n\nThe City Club of Intellectual Games was founded at the University more than 15 years ago. Every year, in November and March, the University becomes the capital of intellectual games. Teams from universities of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine take part in the international festivals “Winter Fox” and \"March Lion\".The international festival of popular songs “Students' Listopad” and the festival of modern pop dance \"Dance 100%\" have already become a tradition. Every year, major cultural events among students are a festival of students' amateur art activity “Students' spring” and a contest of beauty and grace \"Miss Spring\".\n\nThe KVN movement (students' comedy clubs) is very popular among students. Two festivals of KVN teams are held at the University. The University teams are participants and winners of Mogilev Regional KVN League, the Interregional KVN League “Polessye”, the International Union of KVN, the Podmoskovnaya KVN League, the International Festival KiViN (Sochi).\n\nThe University has good sports facilities. The most popular sports are judo, sambo, polyathlon, basketball, powerlifting, arm-wrestling, weight-lifting. The University teams are winners of regional, national and international competitions. Much attention is paid to the secondary employment and labor education of students. Every year, about 200 participants of student construction teams work at the national economy facilities. Student construction teams are winners of regional and national competitions “Youth. Labor. Romance”."
