Shoot 'em ups[]

Star Defender is a series of four side-scrolling arcade-style shoot 'em ups. Gamezebo rated both Star Defender 3 (2007) and Star Defender 4 (2008) 3 out of 5.

Hidden object games[]

Romance Of Rome (2009) is a hidden object game set in the Roman Empire with a romantic storyline. Venessa Carter of Gamezebo awarded Rome 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting the hand-drawn artwork and the difficulty level of the hidden-object sequences. Some objects are semi-transparent or hidden behind other objects, for which Carter commented "It's actually a rather exhilarating challenge for a hidden object pro, but could be quite daunting for someone looking for a more relaxing game. "[8]

Venessa Carter of Gamezebo awarded Golden Trails: The New Western Rush 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the addition of a badge-hunting objective to the usual item-searching gameplay.
