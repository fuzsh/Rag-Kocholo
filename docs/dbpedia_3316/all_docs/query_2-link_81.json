        "text": "Calvert H. Adams, Sr., age 80, of Newark, DE, passed away peacefully at home, with his wife by his side, on Monday, December 9, 2013, after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, PA on December 15, 1932, Cal attended Overbrook High School. For more than 45 years he worked as an auto mechanic, specializing in VWs. During his long career, he worked for several car dealerships before joining Sears Automotive, where he worked until he retired in 1999.\n\nAlways willing to help anyone, at any time, Cal was known as the guy who could fix practically anything. An avid reader, he also enjoyed playing pinochle, tending his vegetable garden, taking cruises, and watching football and old movies. He was a member of the Parkinson’s Strength Training Group at the Newark Senior Center for many years.\n\nCal is survived by his loving wife of 54 years, Isabelle Steel Adams; children, Cathy Kleinschmidt (Mark), Calvert Adams (Susan), and Kelly Stevenson; granddaughters, Krista Norman, Jessica Norman, and Carly Adams; and great granddaughters, Hailey and Peyton. He was preceded in death by his grandson, Robert E. Norman, Jr.\n\nServices will be held privately.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the National Parkinson Foundation, Gift Processing Center, PO Box 5018, Hagerstown, MD 21741-5018 (800-327-4545/parkinson.org) or to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research Grand Central Station, P.O. Box 4777, New York, NY 10163-4777."
