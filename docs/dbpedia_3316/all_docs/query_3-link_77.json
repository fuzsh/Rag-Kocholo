        "text": "Brooklyn’s 50 Most Fascinating People 2022 – Eric Gonzalez\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez\n\nEric Gonzalez made history in November 2017 when he became the first Latino district attorney elected in New York State. He assumed the post after the 2016 death of Ken Thompson, who three years earlier had become the first Black D.A. in Brooklyn.\n\nBut with a promise to helm “the most progressive D.A.’s office in the country,” he didn’t stop making history there.\n\nHomicides and Shootings Continued to Drop in Brooklyn in 2022, Driving Citywide Decline in Gun Violence During Past Two Years\n\nShootings in Brooklyn Decreased by 31% and Homicides Went Down by 21%, Since the 2020 Peak, Accounting for About 88% of the Decline in Murders and 83% of the Declines in Shootings and Shooting Victims Across New York City Over that Time Period\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “I am happy to report that public safety in Brooklyn continued to improve over the past year, as we rebound from the spike in violence that we experienced during 2020. The significant declines in murders and shootings in our borough are driving the citywide gains against gun violence and are a testament to the hard work and focused approach by my Office, the NYPD and all of our partners. We still have work to do as we pledge to drive down gun crimes even further and contend with upticks in other crime categories, but I am confident that we are on the right track. I remain committed to targeting the most violent individuals and to growing our partnerships with community-based groups, violence interrupters and others who are engaged in preventative strategies.”\n\nBrooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez Dedicates Unprecedented Resources to Combat Gun Violence Under Comprehensive STOP VIOLENCE Initiative\n\nBuilding on Reductions in Shootings and Homicides During the First Half of the Year, Plan Adds Personnel, Technology, Intelligence-Sharing Protocols and Community Partnerships to Prevent Shootings and Prosecute Offenders\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez today announced a comprehensive strategy to fight gun violence in Brooklyn and dedicated unprecedented new resources to enhance the Office’s analytics, investigative and technological capacity to prevent violence and to hold accountable those who commit gun crimes. The new investments include a $2 million Digital Evidence Lab, a new Ghost gun Unit and an executive position focusing on gun violence reduction. The Office is also making significant new investments in gang violence prevention programs and youth engagement.\n\nRead the STOP VIOLENCE plan\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez Announces the Creation of New Gender-Based Violence Division\n\nWill Include Domestic Violence, Sex Crimes, Human Trafficking, Victim Services and More; Led by Experienced Prosecutor and National Expert on Intimate Partner Violence\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “Improving the way we approach gender-based violence has long been a goal of my administration and creating this new Division will go a long way toward achieving that. The same trauma-informed and survivor-centered approach is necessary when handling cases of sexual abuse, intimate partner violence or trafficking, and when providing support to survivors. I am confident that under this new structure and with guidance from a nationally recognized expert and veteran prosecutor, the Brooklyn DA’s Office will be able to better assist victims and more effectively bring offenders to justice.”\n\nThe New York Times: Brooklyn D.A. Assigns 1 in 5 Workers to Fight Violence Against Women\n\nThirty-Two Alleged Members of Two Rival Brownsville-Based Gangs Charged With 106 Counts, Including Conspiracy to Commit Murder\n\n19 Shootings, Two of Them Fatal, Included in Four Separate Indictments; 14 Total Victims, Several of Them Innocent Bystanders, including 3-Year-Old Girl and 62-year-old man; 27 Firearms Recovered During Long-Term Investigation\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, together with New York City Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell, today announced that 32 alleged members of two rival street gangs known as WOOO and CHOO are variously charged in four indictments with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to possess weapons, and other related charges including murder, attempted murder, reckless endangerment, and weapons possession. The indictments include charges related to 19 shootings that resulted in 14 victims, including two who died as a result of their injuries. Innocent bystanders, including a 3-year-old girl who was leaving daycare, were wounded in the charged shooting incidents.\n\nNewsDay: Brooklyn DA on Gang Takedown: “Gonna Have a Positive Impact on Public Safety”\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez and NYPD to Host Second Gun Buyback Event This Year in Clinton Hill\n\n$200 and iPad Will be Given for Working Handgun or Assault Rifle, No Questions Asked; Will be Held at Emmanuel Baptist Church on Saturday, May 21\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “Our close collaboration with law enforcement, strong commitment to holding offenders accountable, and constant engagement with communities to prevent violence is bearing fruit, with shootings in Brooklyn decreasing by nearly 25% so far this year following a 20% drop in 2021. As we redouble our efforts to keep our communities safe, we will be hosting another Gun Buyback event this Saturday – just one part of a comprehensive strategy to get firearms off the streets. I encourage anyone who has a gun at home to take advantage of this opportunity, safely turn it in, and get some cash and an iPad in return.”\n\nThe New Yorker: Guns Into Gift Cards, and iPads, Too\n\nSeventeen Alleged Gang Members Charged in Two Indictments Containing Total of 118 Counts, Including Conspiracy to Commit Murder\n\nThree Violent Gangs Allegedly Formed Alliance to Increase Numbers and Territory;\n\nFourteen Shootings Charged During Course of Conspiracy, Including Three Murders\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “This successful takedown is part of our ongoing strategy to reduce shootings and senseless deaths by targeting the most violent offenders in our communities. A particularly troubling aspect of this case is that many of the defendants are teenagers, including an individual charged in connection with all three murders, allegedly committed when he was only 16. We must engage with our young people and help to keep them on the right path. They must learn that there is another way to live beyond the gang life and be given the tools and services to help them succeed. I am committed to doing both: aggressively prosecuting shooters and partnering with community-based groups that work with our youth to prevent future violence.”\n\nNew York Times: 17 Charged as Brooklyn Gang Alliance Is Linked to 4 Deadly Shootings\n\nMan Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison for Strangulation and Assault As Hate Crimes for Attack on Jewish Man Walking Home from Synagogue\n\nShouted Anti-Semitic Slurs Before and After Assault\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez today announced that a man has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for the strangulation and assault as hate crimes for the unprovoked attack against a Jewish man, whom he cursed and strangled as the victim was walking home from a synagogue.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post: Man Gets 11 Years In Jail For 2018 Antisemitic Attack Brooklyn\n\nNine Contractors Indicted for Allegedly Bribing Superintendents at New York City Housing Authority Developments for “Micro Purchase” Contracts\n\nNew York City Department of Investigation began Undercover Probe after NYCHA Employees Reported Allegedly Being Offered Bribes and Unlawful Gratuities\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, together with New York City Department of Investigation Commissioner Margaret Garnett, today announced that nine contractors have been variously charged in multiple indictments with bribery, giving unlawful gratuities, offering a false instrument for filing and conspiracy for allegedly offering NYCHA employees bribes in exchange for “micro purchase” contracts.\n\nThe City: NYCHA Bribe Investigation Snares Contractors Who Made Millions From No-Bid Work, Officials Say\n\nDriver Charged with Assault and Reckless Manslaughter for Allegedly Striking 3-Month-Old Baby and Her Mother While Driving the Wrong Way\n\nCrashed into Vehicle, Causing Both Cars to Enter Crosswalk and Strike Stroller, Killing Baby and Seriously Wounding Her Mom, Then Allegedly Attempted to Highjack Another Car\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “This defendant allegedly drove in a shockingly reckless and criminal manner and destroyed a family in a matter of seconds. A young baby lost her life and her mother suffered life-altering injuries in a case of vehicular violence that simply cannot be tolerated. We intend to now seek justice for little Apolline and will continue to aggressively prosecute unlawful drivers who show disregard for the rules of the road and for the lives of everyone using Brooklyn’s streets.”\n\nAM New York: Driver Charged With Manslaughter For Brooklyn Crash That Killed 3-Month-Old\n\nStudy by the CUNY Institute for State & Local Governance Analyzes Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Brooklyn DA Office’s Prosecutorial Processes\n\nAttorney’s Office found fewer than expected racial disparities in outcomes; study looked at over three years of data to assess and improve ongoing reforms to ensure equal justice for all\n\nToday, the CUNY Institute for State & Local Governance (ISLG) released the findings of a multi-year study analyzing racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes at key points in the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office’s decision-making process. Conducted as part of the DA Eric Gonzalez’s Justice 2020 initiative with joint support from Arnold Ventures and the William T. Grant Foundation, the research presented in Justice in Decision-Making: Studying Racial & Ethnic Disparities in the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office found that while disparities existed at specific decision points and for certain crimes, outcomes were not universally worse for Black and Hispanic people, and better for white and Asian people, across all stages.\n\nNew York Daily News: The Brooklyn Truth On Justice & Race\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez Releases His Office’s Disclosure Letters Regarding Police Officers in Brooklyn\n\nOver 10,100 Letters Released Pursuant to Freedom of Information Law; The Letters, Which List Credibility Findings, are Routinely Provided to Defense Lawyers, as Constitutionally Required, When Police Officers Serve as Witnesses\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “This unprecedented release of disclosure letters should not be viewed as an attack on police officers, who are dedicated to keeping us all safe and work together with my Office in partnership every day. Its goal is to enhance transparency and strengthen trust in the criminal justice system, which relies on police witnesses to make criminal cases and requires the utmost integrity and credibility. These disclosures are required under the law, are being provided to defendants in court and should be part of the public record.”\n\nGothamist: Brooklyn DA Releases Massive Trove Of Internal Documents On NYPD Misconduct\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney’s Office and Clergy Councils Announce Strategic Community Partnerships to Help Reduce Gun Violence\n\nWill Work Together in Impacted Communities on Street-Level Intervention, Alternatives to Incarceration, Victim Services, Clergy Care, Social Support Services and Mentorships; Will Provide Immediate Coordination and Responses to Gun Violence in the Impacted Precinct\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, together with Pastor Gilford T. Monrose, President of the 67th Precinct Clergy Council, “The GodSquad,” today announced a new strategic partnership to help reduce gun violence in Brooklyn. Working together with community members, the NYPD and faith leaders, the DA’s Office and Clergy Councils will endeavor to provide support and guidance to at-risk youth, and offer assistance in several high-crime precincts to strengthen trust between communities and law enforcement as part of a holistic approach to reducing crime and breaking the recurring cycle of violence and criminal justice involvement.\n\nCBS New York: Brooklyn DA Teaming Up With Local Clergy With Eyes On Putting An End To Recent Rash Of Gun Violence\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez Dismisses Over 3,500 Marijuana Cases Following Legalization\n\nThe Cases, Dating Back to the 1970s, Remained Open Mostly Because of Warrants; About 240 Active Cases Previously Dismissed, Virtually Clearing the Docket in Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez today asked the Court to dismiss 3,578 marijuana cases that remained on the docket mostly because of open warrants. With this move, nearly all marijuana cases in Brooklyn have been dismissed. Since the State Legislature legalized marijuana in March, the DA’s Office dismissed about 240 active cases where marijuana was charged, while marijuana charges that are included in felony cases are being dismissed in the course of court proceedings.\n\nNew York Daily News: NYC District Attorney Asks Judge To Toss More Than 3,500 Marijuana Cases In Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez Dismisses All Outstanding Prostitution-Related Warrants\n\n262 Warrants Connected to Offenses That are No Longer Prosecuted Dismissed in First Phase; DA Calls on Legislature to Repeal Loitering Law and Expunge Prostitution Convictions\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “Vacating these warrants and dismissing these cases is consistent with my view that those who engage in these activities need to be offered assistance, not criminally prosecuted. I am also calling on Albany to repeal the law that prohibits what is known as loitering for purposes of prostitution, because of the vagueness of the law, the stark racial inequalities in its enforcement, and the disproportionate harm that enforcement of the law has caused to vulnerable trans women in our community. Additionally, I am asking the legislature to expunge past prostitution convictions so they will not hold people back from opportunities for a better future.”\n\nBuzzfeed News: More Than 1,000 Open Prostitution Cases In Brooklyn Are Going To Be Wiped From The Files\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney’s Office Announces New Program to Assist LGBTQIA+ Survivors of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assaults\n\nKCDA Pride Connect Will Offer Trauma-Informed Support and Community Outreach; Made Possible Through $50,000 State Grant\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez today announced the launch of a new project called KCDA Pride Connect that is designed to empower and assist LGBTQIA+ survivors of intimate partner violence and sexual assault to navigate through the criminal justice system by providing culturally competent and trauma-informed support. The initiative, managed by a social worker from the District Attorney’s Victim Services Unit, will also engage in community outreach and training.\n\nBK Reader: New Program Launched in BK for LGBTQ Survivors of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Publishes Report That Analyzes And Presents the Findings of His Conviction Review Unit\n\nFirst-of-its-Kind Study Conducted with the Innocence Project and WilmerHale Law Firm; Examined Cases of 25 Wrongfully Convicted People Who Spent a Combined 426 Years in Prison\n\nDistrict Attorney Gonzalez said, “I am very proud of Brooklyn’s Conviction Review Unit and the commitment to justice it represents. With this Report, we hope to share the methods, analyses and findings of the CRU with others around the country who are engaged in this critical work, and with the public at large. Wrongful convictions devastate lives – each one of the 25 cases in this Report is its own tragedy – and strike at the heart of our criminal justice system.”\n\n426 Years: An Examination of 25 Wrongful Convictions in Brooklyn, New York"
