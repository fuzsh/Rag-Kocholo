There is a marriage record of Henry Adams to Edith Squire in Charlton Mackrell (next to Barton/Kingweston) on 19 Oct 1609.[2][3] Two of her sisters also married and emigrated to Massachusetts and future records indicate relations between Squire and Adams families. Their son Jonathan remained working on the farm of his Squire grandfather until about 1651. There are letters of attorney that describe a sibling relationship between this Jonathan and other of Henry's children. There are court docs in Massachusetts that also describe the sibling relationships of Henry's children. And then there's Henry's 1646 will, which names his younger children-- the oldest probably having received their share at marriage. All these, combined, support the link to the Barton St. David family.\n\n\"Charlton Mackrell played an important part in pioneer migration to the New England States, especially over the period 1638 to 1650. This movement was inspired by certain religious principles, and a leading spirit in the West Country was the Rev. John White, of Dorchester, Dorset, who is said to have been responsible for over 20,000 emigrants to America. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]\n\nOrigins\n\nHenry Adams (1583-1646) was born in Barton St. David, Somersetshire, England. He was the youngest of 4 children of John Adams* (1555-1604) also of Barton St. David, and Agnes Stone* (___?-1615/16).\n\n\"Gentleman\" Henry Adams (1582-1646), a farmer and maltster, was descended from English yeomen who had lived in Barton St. David for centuries.[citation needed]\n\nHenry was a farmer who held land by the old English system of copyhold from the lord of the manor of Barton St. David about the year 1608 in the village of Charlton Mackrell on the river Cary in the heart of English Somersetshire. [19]\n\nHe was a maltster and, presumably, a husbandman like his father and grandfather before him. The earliest record of him is in 1604 when he was executor of his father's estate and the next on 19 October 1609 when he married Edith Squire in Charlton Mackrell, Somerset.\n\nOnly 2 other records (in England) have been found in which his name is mentioned: in 1609, when he was co-executor of the will of his brother John and an original parchment bond found in the Diocesan Registry showing that in 1614 he was living in Barton St. David. It contains the only known signature of Henry. At some time between 1614 and 1622 he moved to the adjacent parish of Kingweston where his youngest children were baptized, the last in 1629, and where he probably lived until his emigration in 1638.\n\nPresident John Quincy Adams dissented from this opinion of his father that Henry Adams came from Devonshire.\n\nAfter giving the matter particular and thorough investigation, both in this country and in England, he published it as his conviction that Henry Adams was from Braintree in the county of Essex, on the east coast of England. “The statement in the Alden Collection,” he says, “that the first Henry came from Devonshire was received the collector of epitaphs from my father; but I believe it was not from Devonshire but from Braintree in the county of Essex, that he came. My father supposed that he formed part of the company that came with Gov. Winthrop in 1630, most of whom were from Devonshire. But at the time my father formed this opinion, Gov. Winthrop’s Journal had not been published.”\n\nWinthrop’s Journal, I. 37, says, “1632: 14 Aug; The Braintree Company which had begun to settle down at Mt. Wollaston by order of Court, removed to Newtown. These were Mr. Hooker’s Company.” [20]\n\nHooker himself arrived in Sept. 1633, but his Company, which was mostly made up from Chelmsford – perhaps also from Braintree and other neighboring villages of Essex county, - had arrived the year before. Hence it appears highly probable that Henry Adams from Braintree in Essex joined Hooker’s Company and arrived in Boston in 1632. Dr. James Savage, author of the Genealogical Dictionary of early first-comers of New England, concurs in the opinion of President John Quincy Adams.[21]\n\nDisproven Ancient Ancestry\n\nThe \"Ap Adams\" story is one of the most embarrassing nineteenth-century forgeries. It first appeared in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 7 (Jan. 1853) [wrong reference; that volume# and page publishes an abstract of Adams' will], claiming descent from a landed Adams family at Stoke-Gabriel, co. Devon. Because it claims grand ancestry, people have happily quoted it and copied it as gospel (\"hey, it's in print, it has to be right\"). Places that discuss this fraudulent genealogy include:\n\n\"Book Notices,\" in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, 56(1902):211: referring to the pamphlet \"The Ancestry of Henry Adams of Braintree, New England,\" by Rev. Hiram Francis Fairbanks, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1901, 8vo, pp 19.\n\nG.E. C.'s 'Complete Peerage,' Vol. I., page 111,\n\nNEHGS REGISTER, Vol. 37, pp 159-160, Mr. Jos. L. Chester produces proof of the 'forgery' of the portion connecting Henry Adams with Ap Adam.\n\nNEHGS REGISTER, 34:432-433 (John Ward Dean)\n\nNEHGS REGISTER, 31:333\n\nIn 1927, Josiah Gardner Bartlett published the known, documented English origins of Henry Adams, a yeoman farmer from Barton [St.] David (just south of Wells) and next-door Kingweston, Somerset, who married on 19 Oct. 1609 married Edith Squire, from neighboring Charlton Mackrell, Somerset. See Bartlett's book (\"Henry Adams of Somersetshire, England and Braintree, Mass.: His English Ancestry and Some of His Descendants\" [New York, 1927]), also \"Ancestors and Descendants of Jeremiah Adams, 1794-1883, of Salisbury, Connecticut, Sullivan County, New York, Harbor Creek, Pennsylvania and Vermilion, Ohio\" by Enid Eleanor Adams (1974), p. 652, from which I quote:\n\n\"In 1853...an Adams pedigree purporting to show that Henry Adams, English emigrant to New England, was a descendant of one Sir John ap Adams and his wife Elizabeth de Gurnay, heiress to estates in Somersetshire, Dorsetshire and Gloucestershire, was published and has been reprinted and quoted from frequently ever since. J. Gardner Bartlett, in his 1927 history of Henry Adams, stated unequivocally that the alleged connection of Henry Adams with the Ap Adam family of Beverstone and Tidenham rested on forged evidences. In proof [the Ap Adam chart from The Complete Peerage, vol. 1 (1910), pp. 179-81] was given in the Bartlett book. It shows conclusively that the Adams line issuing from Elizabeth de Gurnay ended by an heiress in 1424, 159 YEARS PRIOR TO Henry Adams's birth! [The last male Ap Adams died in 1424, with his nephew John Huntley appar. sole heir.] Moreover, although Sir John Ap Adams acquired vast estates in Gloucestershire and Somersetshire, he never had the manor of Cherleton-Adam.\"\n\nMr. Bartlett's book (1927) has numerous photographs of the Saxon church at Barton [St.] David, bonds and other documents signed by, or associated with, the real Henry Adams, his wife, and their ancestors. Miss Adams's treatment (1974) of Henry and his English background is also excellent.[citation needed]\n\nEmigration\n\nHenry arrived in America in 1638 on the ship Mary & John with his wife, seven sons and one daughter; son Jonathan followed in 1651. Around the same time Henry's wife's sister, Margaret (Squire) Sheppard, her husband Thomas Sheppard, and their children also emigrated, joining a third Squire sister, Anne (Squire) (Purchase) Oliver, who had come to New England in 1633 with her then-husband, Aquila Purchase.\n\nLife in New England\n\nHenry was one of the earliest settlers of Mt. Wollaston, incorporated in 1640 as Braintree, MA and included what is now Quincy, Braintree and Randolph, MA. He received a land grant of 40 acres for 10 people[22] at \"The Mount\" 24 Feb. 1641 in a vote at Boston, of which Braintree was then a part. He settled on that land which became a part of Quincy in 1792. This land remained partially in the male line of descendants until about 1845 when the last occupant had removed to Bridgewater.\n\nThe location of the grant was long unknown to modern descendants, but it is now known that the house stood on present Elm street, Quincy, near South street & close to the town brook.\n\nHenry Adams was known popularly as The Founder of New England, probably because of the extraordinary number (89) of his grandchildren. Apparently, Henry Adams was influenced by Aquila Purchase, Master of Trinity School at Dorchester, who in 1613/14 married Anna Squire, sister to Henry's wife, Edith Squire*, both daughters of Henry Squire*. Henry Squire had three daughters who married and went to New England, all seemingly associated with a group known as the Dorchester Adventurers, led by the Rev. John White, whose first group of Dorset Pilgrims arrived in New England on the ship Mary& John in 1630. This group was largely absorbed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in later years, and by the time Henry Adams came in 1638, many of the original Dorset Pilgrims, particularly those who would not take religious oaths as a prerequisite for citizenship, had moved well into the interior settling around river valleys in MA and CT along the Indian or Dutch territorial frontiers. Windsor CT was one of the principal settlements.\n\nHenry Adams with his large family seems to have preferred settling near the coast and thus stayed in Braintree, MA, which is now known as Quincy, MA. Henry Adams' biographers do not associate him with the more radical and religious Puritans, nor with the liberal and outlawed Pilgrims, but rather see him and other followers of Rev. John White as adventurers, seeking a new world where the boundaries of a class society could be overcome.[citation needed]\n\nHe was made constable at Braintree and took his oath Dec. 5, 1643[23]\n\nIn October 1645, thirty-two residents of Braintree petitioned the General Court regarding a grant of land and among the names were Henry Adams, Sr. and Jr., Thomas, Samuel, John and Christopher, the latter likely an error for Peter Adams. This accounts for all the sons except Jonathan, still in England, and Joseph and Edward who were still minors.\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nHenry died 6 Oct. 1646 and was buried 8 October. His will is dated 1646 and was proved 8 June 1647. It mentions wife Edith [not per Register 7(1853):35; that extract names children, but only refers to \"my wife\"] and all but the 3 oldest children; a copy of the will is printed in the NEHGS \"Register,\" Vol 7, page 35.\n\nThe will mentions: sons Peter, John, Joseph, Edward, Samuel; daughter Ursula; and \"my wife\"[24]\n\nS.P. N.S. 1-429 Will of Henry Adams of Braintree 1646\n\nSons Peter & John & daughter Ursula shall have the ground in the neck, both upland & meadow, during the term I was to enjoy it, until it return to the town's hands again from whom I had it.

Doesn't say who took it.\n\nSomme ground within the fence leading to Weymouth ferry £10.\n\nThe estate inventory, dated 8 June 1647, revealed that he had a house and a barn, a cow and a calf, some pigs, furniture and utensils, and three beds. More noteworthy and probably relics of the old days in England were a silver spoon and some old books. His estate was worth about 75 pounds.[19]\n\nA monument was erected by his grave by his descendant, John Adams, second President of the United States, inscribed as follows: \"In Memory of HENRY ADAMS who took his flight from the Dragon persecution in Devonshire in England, and alighted with eight sons,near Mount Wollaston. One of the sons returned to England, and after taking time to explore the country, four removed to Medfield and the neighboring towns; two to Chelmsford. One only, Joseph, who lies hereat his left hand, remained here, who was an original proprietor in the township of Briantree, incorporated in 1639. This stone and several others have been placed in this yard, by a great-great grandson, from a veneration of the Piety, humility, simplicity, prudence, patience,temperance, frugality, industry and perseverance, of his Ancestors, in hopes of Recommending and imitation of their virtues to their posterity. ... Erected December, 1823\" President Adams did not have the place of Henry's origin quite correct, as Henry came from Somerset, the county east of Devon. His son John Quincy, 6th President, was even further off, believing, unlike his father, that Henry was more likely from Braintree, England and that he came with Thomas Hooker's company to New England in 1632.\n\nHis widow Edith (Squire) Adams married about 1651, John Fussell of Weymouth, and removed about 1654 to Medfield where several of the Adams children resided. She died Jan. 21, 1672/3 and he died there Feb. 21,1675/6 when his house was burned by Indians.\n\nChildren\n\nHenry Adams and Edith Squire had 9 children:[25]\n\nHenry Adams, Jr. (1610-1675), emigrated with his parents to Braintree MA.

Her absence from Henry's will which names his younger children makes this relationship unlikely, but the possibility of some connection remains. See Mary (Adams) Fairbanks (abt.1625-1711) for further discussion.\n\nSources\n\n↑ John Hamilton Adams, History of Our Branch of The Adams Family, 1886-from FT Wayne library.\n\n↑ Somerset : Charlton Mackrell : Virgin Mary : Register of unspecified type : \"Parish Register\" database, FreeREG (https://www.freereg.org.uk/search_records/581859eee93790eb7fa38a3e : viewed 13 Dec 2022) marriage Henry Adams to Edith Squire 19 Oct 1609\n\n↑ Somerset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1531-1812. https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/60856/engl78030_d-p-cha-ma-2-1-1_m_00007?pid=516708\n\n↑ George Norbury MacKensie, editor, Colonial Families of the US, 1966-vol VI p311, Findlay library\n\n↑ Mary E.
