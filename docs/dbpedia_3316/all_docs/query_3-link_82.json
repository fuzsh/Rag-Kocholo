        "text": "More than two years into New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ first term, a growing list of top appointees have left the administration.\n\nWithin an hour alone on May 16, 2024 three different officials announced they’d be leaving their jobs at City Hall: Risk Management and Compliance Director Marjorie Landa, who said she was retiring, and Small Business Services Commissioner Kevin Kim and senior adviser Joel Eisdorfer, both citing a desire to spend more time with their family.\n\nThey were only the latest in a long string of departing officials. José Bayona, executive director of the Office of Ethnic and Community Media, handed in his resignation two weeks ago, marking a blow to Latino representation within the Adams administration. In April, Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes Executive Director Hassan Naveed was reportedly fired for an unspecified cause, sparking pushback from advocates and some City Council members. News broke earlier in the month that City Hall’s top lawyer Sylvia Hinds-Radix and Civilian Complaint Review Board Chair Arva Rice were both being pushed out of their positions by the administration. Department of Citywide Administrative Services Commissioner Dawn Pinnock announced her June resignation around the same time.\n\nOther top officials bid City Hall farewell further back, like then Department of Social Services Commissioner Gary Jenkins, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, Department of Correction Commissioner Louis Molina – who is still employed by City Hall, albeit as assistant deputy mayor for public safety – and of course the mayor’s longtime ally Frank Carone, whose lobbying firm has become somewhat of a reunion for Adams’ administration departees.\n\nAdams has repeatedly pushed back on questions suggesting the departures are linked to dysfunction in his administration, saying it’s normal for an administration to experience turnover.\n\n“We're two and a half years in,” he told reporters last week. “People are going to come in and out. Some people are going to go and probably be part of my campaign. Later, they're going to switch to new roles. That's just the nature of the business. No one does this forever.”\n\nDepartures aside, Adams has continued to illustrate his appreciation for building a diverse administration. The majority of his deputy mayors are women and people of color, and he’s made many historic appointments, including the first Latino New York City police commissioner and the second Black woman to lead the Department of Correction.\n\nHere’s who has been appointed to major positions in the Adams administration so far. This list was last updated on May 20, 2024.\n\nCity Hall Insiders\n\nFirst deputy mayor: Sheena Wright\n\nWright was appointed deputy for strategic initiatives after leading Adams’ transition committee, and in January 2023 assumed the role of first deputy mayor following Lorraine Grillo’s departure. She was once the president and CEO of the nonprofit United Way of New York City, and before that, she led the Abyssinian Development Corp. Her reported partner is David Banks, who has been appointed city schools chancellor. Her appointment as the next first deputy mayor was announced Dec. 6, 2022.\n\nDeputy mayor for housing, economic development and workforce development: Maria Torres-Springer\n\nMost recently the vice president for U.S. programs at the Ford Foundation, Torres-Springer previously served in the de Blasio administration as commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, president and CEO of the Economic Development Corp. and commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services. Her husband, Jamie Torres-Springer, is president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s construction and development division. Her appointment as deputy mayor for economic and workforce development was announced on Dec. 20, 2021. On May 30, 2023, Adams announced that her role would be expanded to include oversight of the administration’s housing agenda.\n\nDeputy mayor for health and human services: Anne Williams-Isom\n\nPrior to joining the administration, Williams-Isom was the James R. Dumpson endowed chair in child welfare at Fordham’s Graduate School of Social Service, Williams-Isom is best known as the former CEO and COO of the Harlem Children’s Zone, an anti-poverty nonprofit organization. Before that, she was at the New York City Administration for Children’s Services for more than a decade, ending her tenure as a deputy commissioner. Her appointment was announced on Dec. 20, 2021.\n\nDeputy mayor for operations: Meera Joshi\n\nJoshi came to the Adams administration from the federal government, where she’s deputy administrator in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. She was briefly New York general manager at Sam Schwartz consultants before that, but is best known as the former chair and CEO of New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. She also has experience at the city Department of Investigation and the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Her appointment was announced on Dec. 20, 2021.\n\nDeputy mayor for public safety: Philip Banks\n\nBanks resigned as chief of department for the NYPD in 2014 after a 28-year career. He said the cause was professional differences between himself and then-Commissioner Bill Bratton. But it was later revealed that Banks was under federal investigation for possible influence trading. He was never charged with a crime, but named in court papers as an unindicted co-conspirator. More recently, Banks has been consulting city governments and police departments with his firm CitySafe Partners. His brother is New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks. His appointment was officially announced on Jan. 7, 2022.\n\nAssistant deputy mayor of public safety: Louis Molina\n\nAfter leading the Department of Correction for nearly two years, Molina was appointed to this vaguely defined role on Oct. 31, 2023. A press release announcing the appointment described the former NYPD detective’s job as “coordinating with all city agencies on public safety matters to ensure they align with Mayor Adams’ vision.” Before his stint as DOC commissioner, Molina served as chief of the Las Vegas Department of Public Safety in Nevada and as the chief internal monitor and acting assistant commissioner in the DOC’s compliance unit, which monitored the use of force in city jails.\n\nDeputy mayor for strategic initiatives: Ana Almanzar\n\nAlmanzar joined the Adams administration in early June 2023 after spending much of her professional career bridging the gap between the nonprofit and government sector. Most recently, she served as director of community relations at Mother Cabrini Health Foundation where she worked to bolster health outcomes in diverse communities. Prior to that, she was chief of staff under the Cuomo administration’s nonprofit division. Almanzar’s appointment was announced May 26, 2023.\n\nDeputy mayor for communications: Fabien Levy\n\nAdams’ enthusiastic press secretary Fabien Levy was promoted to the somewhat newly created role of deputy mayor for communications on Aug. 14, 2023. Levy previously served as Attorney General Letitia James’ press secretary, but joined the Adams administration at its start. Levy will spearhead the administration’s messaging strategy – a focus of the mayor’s as he objects to criticism in the press.\n\nChief adviser to the mayor: Ingrid Lewis-Martin\n\nLewis-Martin has been one of Adams’ closest advisers since before he entered the state Senate in 2007. The “tough-as-nails gatekeeper” has worked with him throughout Adams’ political career, most recently as deputy borough president of Brooklyn. Her appointment was announced on Jan. 10, 2022.\n\nChief counsel to the mayor: Lisa Zornberg\n\nLisa Zornberg was announced as the city’s next chief counsel on July 26, 2023, taking over for Brendan McGuire, who served in that role since the beginning of Adams’ administration. Like McGuire, Zornberg comes to the role with experience at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and more recent experience in private practice. Zornberg steps in as the city faces an array of acute challenges, including the asylum-seeker crisis and growing calls for federal intervention at Rikers Island, where dangerous conditions persist.\n\nChief of staff to the mayor: Camille Joseph Varlack\n\nVarlack, an attorney and the former senior adviser to the mayor, was named Adams’ next chief of staff in December 2022. Before joining city government, Varlack worked at the law firm Bradford Edwards & Varlack LLP as a founding partner and chief operating officer. She also oversaw 60 agencies in state government under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as the deputy director of state operations, chief risk officer and special counsel. She assumed the role of chief of staff in January 2023.\n\nDeputy chief of staff to the mayor: Madeline Labadie\n\nLabadie is also coming from the TLC, where she worked for seven years, most recently as director of strategic initiatives. Before that, she was a political coordinator for the Hotel Trades Council.\n\nDeputy chief of staff to the mayor: Menashe Shapiro\n\nA top staffer on Eric Adams’ mayoral campaign – known for defending the candidate on Twitter – Shapiro is an attorney and longtime political consultant who previously worked on Michael Bloomberg’s presidential and 2009 reelection campaign.\n\nDeputy chief of staff and senior emergency adviser and Office of Asylum-Seeker Operations Interim Director: Molly Schaeffer\n\nStaying on from Bill de Blasio’s City Hall, Schaeffer is going to focus on COVID-19 and “public safety” for Adams. Schaeffer had been with de Blasio since his first election as mayor, previously serving as a policy adviser at DOE, then DOHMH and deputy chief of staff to the deputy mayor for operations. Schaeffer was also made the interim director of the city’s Office of Asylum Seeker Operations, which was announced in March 2023.\n\nDirector of intergovernmental and external affairs: Tiffany Raspberry\n\nA top adviser on Adams’ campaign and transition team, Raspberry has been a political consultant and lobbyist for nearly two decades, recently representing clients including Success Academy charter schools and tobacco company Reynolds American. She now leads his intergovernmental affairs team.\n\nCommunications Director: Ryan Birchmeier\n\nBirchmeier came to head the Adams’ communication team on March 8 after leading housing- and economic development-related communications for the mayor’s office since 2023. The position had been open since summer 2023. He previously served as the deputy commissioner for public information at the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation.\n\nFirst Deputy Communications Director: Erika Tannor\n\nBefore joining the mayor’s communications team, Tannor served as senior vice president at Tusk Strategies where she led national issue-based campaigns. She’s also worked under Letitia James in the public advocate’s office, served as communications and policy director to former New York City Council Member Rafael Espinal, and was a founding board member of nonprofit think tank 5BORO Institute.\n\nSenior adviser for public safety: Timothy Pearson\n\nPearson is one of the mayor’s closest friends, and he seems to get special treatment within City Hall. His salary is paid by the city’s nonprofit Economic Development Corporation, which exempts him from many disclosure rules and allows him to keep receiving his police pension. He was also initially allowed to keep his second job leading security at the Resorts World casino in Queens. He quit that, but now has a job in Adams’ orbit, Politico reported, “with ill-defined responsibilities and outsized influence.” In October 2023, Pearson reportedly got into an altercation with guards at a migrant shelter in Manhattan trying to enter the shelter without identifying himself. The city Department of Investigation has opened an inquiry into the incident.\n\nSenior adviser to the mayor: Stefan Ringel\n\nRingel is one of Adams’ longest-tenured aides. He started at Brooklyn Borough Hall under the previous borough president, Marty Markowitz, and worked for Adams as communications director, then senior adviser, and worked on his mayoral campaign as well. Before that, Ringel worked comms for then-Council Member Jumaane Williams.\n\nSenior adviser to the mayor and director of scheduling: Gladys Miranda\n\nMiranda is one of Adams’ closest aides, and he thanked her in particular on election night. She held the same title working for Adams at Brooklyn Borough Hall, where she first started in 2007 under then-Borough President Marty Markowitz.\n\nSenior adviser to the mayor and director of public service engagement: Andrea Shapiro Davis\n\nA longtime City University of New York leader who most recently served as interim vice chancellor for university advancement, she previously worked as a senior adviser to former Mayor Bloomberg, whose City Hall she worked in for all 12 years.\n\nSenior adviser to the mayor: Joel Eisdorfer\n\nEisdorfer has been a lobbyist with his firm, New York Capital Group, where he represented real estate developers, among others. Before that, he worked as a top aide to Adams when he was borough president and a state senator before that. According to Hamodia, Eisdorfer is the first Hasidic Jew on the mayor’s senior staff. In June 2023, Adams named Eisdorfer the chair of the city’s new Jewish Advisory Council. News broke May 16, 2024 that he plans to depart the administration for family reasons, however, he will still volunteer on Adams’ reelection campaign next year and chair the mayor’s Jewish Advisory Council.\n\nSenior adviser for severe mental illness: Brian Stettin\n\nBrian Stettin, the longtime policy director at the Treatment Advocacy Center, will serve directly under Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom, working on the city’s in-patient psychiatric programs and Assisted Outpatient Treatment programs, and serving New Yorkers with severe mental illness. Stettin’s appointment marks a return to New York government; he previously served as counsel to the Health Committee of the New York Assembly, among other roles. His appointment was announced on July 11, 2022.\n\nSenior education adviser: Mark Treyger\n\nThe former City Council Member, who represented parts of southern Brooklyn for eight years, is also executive director of intergovernmental affairs for the Department of Education. A close ally of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Treyger was previously a high school teacher and union delegate. His appointment was announced in January 2022.\n\nChief administrative officer: Mir Bashar\n\nMir Bashar’s promotion puts the former senior director of budget and financial planning under Bill de Blasio in charge of day-to-day finances, budget, contracts and administration. He has been working in similar roles at City Hall since Rudy Giuliani’s administration. Bashar’s appointment was announced on July 15, 2022.\n\nSpecial counsel to the mayor: Ama Dwimoh\n\nDwimoh is a veteran of Team Eric Adams, having served as special counsel and chief of compliance to Adams when he was Brooklyn borough president. Dwimoh took a brief break from brough hall to run for Brooklyn district attorney in a failed bid in 2017.\n\nChief of staff to the first deputy mayor: Yume Kitasei\n\nKitasei brings a long history in city government to the role serving under Wright. Kitasei worked in the de Blasio administration in multiple roles including chief of staff to the deputy mayor for operations, and before that served as chief of staff to former New York City Council Member Margaret Chin.\n\nDeputy director of the mayor’s office of food policy: Rachel Atcheson\n\nRachel Atcheson was first named as senior assistant – also serving as unofficial food diarist – to Adams, as well as the at-large director of the SUNY Downstate Committee on Plant-Based Health and Nutrition. She then served as special adviser to Varlack, and in June 2023 was promoted to deputy director in the mayor’s office of food policy. Atcheson previously worked on animal welfare issues in the mayor’s office.\n\nSpecial adviser to the mayor and director of Asian affairs: Winnie Greco\n\nGreco has been an Adams ally dating back to his borough presidency, where she served as an ambassador to the Chinese community. She traveled with Adams to China in 2014 on a cultural trip hosted by her nonprofit, the Sino-America New York Brooklyn Archway Association Corp. Greco previously ran an food export business, Valley Fresh Direct. Greco’s hire was never formally announced by City Hall, but the City Record shows she started Jan. 2, 2022. On Feb. 29, federal agents descended on two of Greco’s homes, searching the properties as part of an investigation being conducted with the Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office. It is unclear what the investigation was focused on at this point nor is it clear whether it has any connection to the inquiry into Adams. Greco, who had a medical episode during the search, was initially placed on unpaid leave, however she returned to work in early May.\n\nAgency Heads\n\nDepartment for the Aging commissioner: Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez\n\nLorraine Cortés-Vázquez, who sits on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board and on the board of trustees for the City University of New York, has been Department for the Aging commissioner since 2019. Adams announced her reappointment on March 31. She previously served as secretary of state under Govs. Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson and worked at the AARP and the Hispanic Federation.\n\nDepartment of Buildings commissioner: Jimmy Oddo\n\nFormer Staten Island Borough President Jimmy Oddo was announced as the next commissioner of the Department of Buildings on April 27, 2023, as City & State first reported. Oddo takes over as commissioner following fellow Republican and former City Council Member Eric Ulrich’s resignation in November 2022, after Ulrich was questioned in connection to an illegal gambling investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Kazimir Vilenchik, who was first deputy commissioner under Ulrich, had been serving as acting commissioner after Ulrich’s departure and will now return to the first deputy position. Oddo was already an Adams administration insider, serving as chief of staff to Deputy Mayor of Operations Meera Joshi.\n\nBusiness Integrity commissioner and chair: Elizabeth Crotty\n\nA defense attorney in private practice, Crotty ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, finishing sixth in the eight-way primary. She was previously an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office and a litigator at Kreindler & Kreindler.\n\nAdministration for Children’s Services commissioner: Jess Dannhauser\n\nNew York City’s child welfare system will fall under the leadership of Dannhauser, the former president and CEO of Graham Windham, a social services nonprofit for children and families. Dannhauser previously worked at ACS in several positions, including associate commissioner for performance measurement, monitoring and improvement.\n\nDepartment of Citywide Administrative Services commissioner: Dawn Pinnock\n\nAlready the acting commissioner since November 2021, Pinnock officially got the commissioner title in the Adams administration. She was previously the DCAS executive deputy commissioner, and before that, worked for New York City Transit and NYCHA.\n\nDepartment of City Planning director and City Planning Commission chair: Dan Garodnick\n\nMost recently president and CEO of the Riverside Park Conservancy, who brought lawn-mowing goats to the greenspace, Garodnick is best known for representing much of the east side of Manhattan in the New York City Council from 2006 until 2017. In that position, he helped negotiate the purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.\n\nDepartment of City Planning executive director: Edith Hsu-Chen\n\nWhile the City Charter mandates that the DCP director and CPC chair are the same person, Hsu-Chen will also have a leading role at City Planning. Hsu-Chen has been with DCP since 1997, when she started as an intern, and most recently served as the agency’s Manhattan director.\n\nDepartment of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner: Vilda Vera Mayuga\n\nMost recently deputy secretary of state for economic opportunity, Mayuga has served in government for years, previously as chair of the New York State Industrial Board of Appeals, deputy commissioner for worker protection at the state Department of Labor, an assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Bureau, an agency attorney at the Fire Department of New York and a paralegal specialist at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nDepartment of Correction commissioner: Lynelle Maginley-Liddie\n\nAn eight-year veteran of the city Department of Correction, Maginley-Liddie was appointed commissioner on Dec. 8, 2023 – a little over a month after her predecessor, Louis Molina, was named assistant deputy mayor for public safety. Maginley-Liddie first joined the DOC in 2015 as an agency attorney and later went on to lead the department’s General Litigation Unit. In 2021, she was named first deputy commissioner and chief diversity officer. Born in Antigua, Maginley-Liddie is only the second Black woman to lead DOC.\n\nDepartment of Cultural Affairs commissioner: Laurie Cumbo\n\nCumbo represented parts of Brooklyn in the City Council from 2014 through 2021, and endorsed Adams on the day he formally launched his campaign. Before that, she founded and led the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts.

Early reports of Tisch’s appointment initially prompted a lament from the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association president that Adams was “letting somebody very good get away,” referring to former Commissioner Ed Grayson. While it was never announced by the Adams administration, City & State first reported that Tisch had been leading the City Cleanup Corps since the beginning of 2022 in what appeared to be a “try out” for the sanitation job.

Before taking office, he was a teacher and activist.\n\nDepartment of Transportation chief of staff: Ryan Lynch\n\nLynch joined Adams at Brooklyn Borough Hall back in 2014, rising up to becoming the then-borough president’s chief of staff.
