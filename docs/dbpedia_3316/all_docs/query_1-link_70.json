        "text": "NAPLES â€” Richard C. Adams, 70, passed away unexpectedly at his home on Wednesday, Jan. 19, 2011 as the result of failing health reasons, which led to congestive heart failure.\n\nHe was born on April 24, 1940 in Naples, the oldest of the nine sons born to Charles H. Adams, Sr. and Ferne Whitlock Adams. He attended schools in Naples and Casco. Upon leaving Casco High School, he entered the U.S. Navy. It was while he was in Navy that he met and married his first wife, Louise Klusaritz of Pennsylvania, who was the mother of his four children.\n\nRichard enjoyed watching Red Sox games, deep-sea fishing and hunting. November was a special month for him and his hunting buddies, tracking down the wily whitetails.\n\nAfter moving back to Maine after many years in Connecticut, he was employed at Dielectric Communications in Raymond, and lastly at Yankee Machine in Casco. He was a skilled machinist and lathe operator.\n\nHe was predeceased by his father and four brothers, Austin, George, Michael and Billy.\n\nSurvivors besides his wife, Gwen and mother, Ferne, are sisters Sylvia Wentworth of Lisbon Falls, Elizabeth Chute of Casco and Charlotte Adams of Sebago; brothers Harry and Steven of Bridgton, and John and Freddy of Naples; sons Richard C. Adams Jr. of West Haven, Jeffrey of Naples and Scott of Decatur, Ga.; daughter Boni Rickett of Naples; eight grandchildren; two great-grandsons; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nVisiting hours were held on Jan. 19 at Hall Funeral Home in Casco. Interment will be held at a later date. Time and place to be announced.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Mrs. Sally Wentworth, 622 Lisbon Road, Lisbon Falls, ME for the Flag Fund."
