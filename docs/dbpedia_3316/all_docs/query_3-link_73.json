        "text": ">> >>The Real Face of John Quincy Adams No. 2 - Life Mask Reconstruction\n\nIntroâ¦.\n\n6th U. S. President John Quincy is my favorite president, though most of his accomplishments were after his presidency, particularly against slavery. Adams once reportedly stated, âThe four most miserable years of my life were my four years in the presidency.â As a congressman, Adams said that he took delight in the fact that southerners would forever remember him as âthe acutest, the astutest, the archest enemy of southern slavery that ever existed.â\n\nIt has been suggested that John Quincy Adams had the highest I.Q. of any U.S. president. Dean Simonton, a professor of psychology at UC Davis, estimated his I.Q. score at 175.1 Adams spoke and wrote seven languages by the age of ten. Adams also became a leading force for the promotion of science. As president, he had proposed a national observatory, which did not win much support. Adams became Congressâs primary supporter of the future Smithsonian Institution. He also translated a copy of the New Testament Bible from Greek to English.\n\nQuite a resume for âOld Man Eloquent.â\n\nThe Life Mask â Another View\n\nBelow are my 2nd Photoshop reconstructions of J. I. Browereâs 1825 life mask of John Quincy Adams. These images show Adams when he was congressman, much later in life with his \"mutton chops.\"\n\nLife masks of John Quincy Adams Source: Cheryl A. Daniel, with special thanks to Fenimore Art Museum, Cooperstown N.Y.\n\nJ. I. Browereâs âwork achieved a stark realism uncommon in that day. His plaster busts showed the age-lined brow, the pock-marked face; his subjects appeared as they were, not as artists generally portrayed them. His life masks were, and remain, the most authentic likenesses of some historic figures who lived in a day before photography provided more easily obtained but similarly uncompromising portraits.â2\n\nLife mask reconstruction of John Quincy Adams.\n\nLife mask reconstruction of John Quincy Adams\n\nAn Open Letter and the Real Faces of President John Quincy Adams\n\nSee all my John Quincy Adams Works"
