        "text": "Advisor: Scott E. Casper, Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, Professor of History, University of Maryland, Baltimore County; National Humanities Center Fellow. Copyright National Humanities Center, 2014\n\nWhat qualities of citizen leadership did John Adams consider essential to sustain and nurture the young republic? How do his letters to his growing son John Quincy reveal his point of view about the new nation?\n\nUnderstanding\n\nIn this study of the letters of John Adams and John Quincy Adams from 1774 to 1793, two central themes are highlighted — how Adams unfolded his “curriculum” for citizen leadership, and how his point of view changed from parent-teacher to mentor-guide as John Quincy entered the realm of American political life. To Adams, a citizen leader of the United States needed to exhibit upstanding moral character and self-discipline, acquire a solid foundation in classical learning, develop keen insight into the political dynamics of a democracy, and accept the challenges and sacrifices of public life. As his son grew from a child into a young man, John Adams fostered these qualities through the long-distance medium of letters.\n\nTeacher’s Note\n\nBecome familiar with the letters before beginning a close analysis. Have students read them aloud — with overdramatic emphasis, perhaps — to accommodate to the eighteenth-century language, to situate themselves in the father-son relationship, and to sense the writers’ intentions and feelings behind the words. Imagine growing up as John Quincy: you come to realize how important your father is to the country as it breaks from Britain, wins its independence, and inaugurates its nationhood. You also come to realize that your father is preparing to pass the torch on to you and your generation. Use the graphic organizer to chart John Adams’s guidance in preparing his son as a future citizen leader of the young republic. (A completed graphic organizer with suggested entries is provided.)\n\nAlso have students consider how private correspondence differs from works written for the public. How do these differences affect the study of letters as historical documents? What insights can be gained about the creation of the United States from the private letters of the Founding Fathers? With the overarching questions below, guide your students in discussing the letters as a whole. (Close reading questions are in the Text Analysis section.)\n\nDuring each stage of John Quincy’s maturation (childhood, adolescence, young adulthood), characterize the interchange between him and his father in their letters. What’s happening in their letters?\n\nWhat “sentiments” (emotions) do they reveal in their letters?\n\nHow does their father–son relationship change over the years?\n\nAt what point does John Quincy begin to comment on the social and political realities around him? What does he find important to describe to his father?\n\nHow does he evaluate social and political life in Europe, at Harvard, and later in Boston?\n\nSelect letters that mark the four transitions below. Point out specific elements in the letters that indicate the changes. (You might or might not choose four separate letters.) Do items B and C mark the same transition?\n\nJohn Adams stops addressing his son as a child.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams starts addressing his father as a fellow adult.\n\nThe father–son correspondence reflects a peer-to-peer relationship.\n\nJohn Adams states his goal of preparing his son to be a citizen leader.\n\nWhat aspects of moral character does John Adams emphasize in his letters? What habits of a healthy and useful life? For Adams, who is a “good Man”?\n\nFor Adams, what constitutes a “useful Citizen,” especially in a republic? Cite specific comments in Adams’s letters.\n\nHow will education make John Quincy “a good Man and a useful Citizen”? Specifically, how will classical learning (the Greek and Roman classics) train John Quincy’s mind?\n\nWhat does Adams recommend for his son’s personal happiness? What happiness has Adams lost in his civic career? What has he gained?\n\nWhat does Adams want his son to learn about a life of civic duty to one’s country? What ideals does he value?\n\nWhat does he want him to learn about politics — the nitty-gritty in which a citizen leader must function?\n\nDoes he think John Quincy can rise to the challenge? What evidence leads you to your answer?\n\nHow do his letters to John Quincy reveal his point of view about the young republic?\n\nPut it all together. What qualities of a citizen leader did John Adams consider essential to sustain and nurture the young republic? How did he foster these qualities in his son John Quincy Adams?\n\nTeacher’s Guide (continues below)\n\nBackground note\n\nText analysis and close reading questions with answer key\n\nAdditional graphic organizer with answer key\n\nInteractive exercises\n\nFollow-up assignment\n\nStudent Version (click to open)\n\nInteractive PDF\n\nBackground note\n\nText analysis and close reading questions\n\nInteractive exercises\n\nTeacher’s Guide\n\nBackground\n\nJohn Adams and John Quincy Adams were the nation’s first father–son presidents (the second being George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush). John Adams served as the second president from 1797 to 1801, and John Quincy Adams took office twenty-four years later as the sixth president, from 1825 to 1829. At age 89, John Adams was thrilled with his son’s election, writing him that “Never did I feel so much solemnity as upon this occasion. The multitude of my thoughts, and the intensity of my feelings are too much for a mind like mine, in its ninetieth year.” [February 18, 1825]\n\nJohn Adams’s concept of citizen leader was shaped by his experiences in the Continental Congress and as a U.S. diplomat to European countries during and after the Revolution. He understood that the new nation needed a new type of citizen leader — one that championed the revolutionary ideals of liberty and democracy while understanding the young nation’s vulnerability to political divisiveness, inexperience, and isolation. With this in mind, Adams set out to nurture his sons, especially firstborn John Quincy, as citizen leaders who would take the nation securely into the nineteenth century. This goal reflects John Adams’s oft-quoted statement of his duty as a father and Founding Father: “I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have liberty to study Painting and Poetry, Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Mathematicks and Philosophy, Geography, Natural History, Naval Architecture, Navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their Children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine.” [letter to Abigail Adams, May 12, 1780]\n\nWhen young John Quincy was seven years old, John Adams left their Massachusetts home to serve as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Little did the family know that they would rarely live together again, as Adams served a long civic career in America and Europe. These selections from the father–son letters follow John Adams’s long-distance guidance of his son’s upbringing. From the outset, Adams stressed moral character and the value of classical learning (Greek and Roman classics). The goal of education, he wrote to thirteen-year-old John Quincy, is “to make you a good Man and a useful Citizen. This will ever be the Sum total of the Advice of your affectionate Father.” After John Quincy completed his formal education and began his adult life as a young lawyer, his father guided his entry into the turbulent world of politics, stressing that “the true interest and honor of your Country should be your only Object.”\n\nThe letters in this lesson span twenty years, from 1774 to 1793, and follow John Adams from age 38 to 58 and John Quincy from age seven to 26. They focus on three phases in John Quincy’s maturation:\n\nages 7–10, as a child at home with his mother and siblings during the Revolutionary War.\n\nages 12–18, as a student in Europe and America, often separated from his family.\n\nages 23–26, as a Harvard graduate and a lawyer beginning his practice in Boston.\n\nSoon after the course of these letters, John Quincy Adams began his lifetime career as a citizen leader, serving as a U.S. diplomat to the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain (UK); and as a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, and the sixth president of the United States (1825–1829). After his presidency, he represented his Massachusetts district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1831 until his death in 1848.\n\nTo read the existing father-son correspondence from 1774 to 1793, visit Founders Online from the National Archives. In the search line, enter Correspondent: “Adams, John” AND Correspondent: “Adams, John Quincy” to access 121 letters (66 from father to son and 55 from son to father). The editors’ footnotes are included.\n\nConsult the timelines of Adams’s life and career from the Massachusetts Historical Society and American Experience (PBS).

I make but a poor figure at Composition; my head is much too fickle, my Thoughts are running after birds’ eggs, play, and trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma has a troublesome task to keep me Steady, and I own [admit] I am ashamed of myself…. I wish, sir, you would give me Some instructions with regard to my time and advise me how to proportion [schedule] my Studies and my Play, in writing, and I will keep them by me and endeavour to follow them…. John Quincy Adams\n\nWhat evidence does this letter offer to suggest that Adams sees his son as a future citizen leader?\n\nAdams practically announces to his son that his future will likely be as a citizen leader “of your Country” (if it wins its independence, of course). Someday you will be in my place, he implies, and you must begin to prepare yourself for the role “which may be allotted you to act on the Stage of Life.” John Quincy is ten years old when he receives this letter.\n\nExcerpt 2: 1790\n\nExcerpt 3: 1792\n\nFollow-Up Assignment\n\nIn this follow-up assignment , students read excerpts from John Quincy Adams’s letter of condolence to his father in 1800 after John Adams was defeated for a second term as president of the United States (by Thomas Jefferson).
