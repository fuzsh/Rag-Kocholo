        "text": "The first question you might be asking is 'What's the Seibu line'? It's a network of train lines operated by Seibu Railway, running from Shinjuku and Ikebukuro stations through Tokyo's residential areas and all the way to Saitama Prefecture. Since we know Tokyoites and tourists alike enjoy discovering unique things to do beyond the capital, we decided to create a new guide map that lets you hop on one of the Seibu line trains and explore Tokyo as well as the pretty towns of Kawagoe and Chichibu.\n\nTitled '101 things to do in Tokyo along the Seibu lines', the guide map introduces local restaurants, sento public baths, museums and more. It takes you from the heart of Tokyo all the way to the small historic town of Kawagoe, which features one of the few remaining Edo-period streetscapes, traditional warehouses and shops selling Japan's popular craft beer Coedo. The map also invites you to visit the scenic town of Chichibu in Saitama Prefecture where you can do things like spend a night in a temple and go river rafting in a traditional wooden boat.\n\nTo get from Seibu-Shinjuku Station in Tokyo to Hon-Kawagoe Station in Kawagoe, it only takes about 45 minutes on the limited express train. To get from Ikebukuro Station in Tokyo to Seibu-Chichibu Station in Chichibu, it takes about 78 minutes on the limited express train."
