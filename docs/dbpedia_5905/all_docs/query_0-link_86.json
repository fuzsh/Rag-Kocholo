        "text": "The Doha Metro is a rapid transit system in Qatarâs capital Doha. In recent years, Doha has achieved brisk economic growth thanks to its abundant energy resources. However this also presents a challenge, as traffic congestion has become a serious problem due to the rapid increase in population and automobile industry. Combining this with the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Soccer World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in 2022, a reliable public transportation system has become an urgent necessity.\n\nIn order to cope with this problem, the construction of Doha Metro has been started with an operational length of 76 km for 3 lines for Phase 1. The first section of Redline has started its preview services on 8 May 2019.\n\nDoha Metro is operated by fully unmanned operation (GoA-4) using an inverter control device and train control and management system (TCMS) called Synaptra manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd. (Mito Works). The inverter controller applies a high-efficiency hybrid SiC-IGBT* device to reduce heat generation so that it can operate without any problem even in a hot desert environment (55Â°C). TCMS system also integrates various control devices and parts in the vehicle. It also collects and distributes control / failure information in real time to support fully unmanned operation.\n\nUp to the present time, a total of 225 cars (3 cars Ã 75 trains) have been delivered to Doha, with an additional 35 trains to be completed next year. Eventually, a line extension with an approximate length of 140 km is currently planned for the near future.\n\n* :\n\nSiC: silicon carbide IGBT: insulated gate bipolar transistor\n\nNew double-deck trains are needed to meet the increasing demand for high-capacity mass transportation systems used to provide regional and commuter services. The Caravaggio Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) is a part of Hitachiâs new family of double-deck high-capacity trains. Framework agreements were signed with clients for the supply of up to 300 Caravaggio EMU train sets to Trenitalia and 120 train sets to Ferrovie Nord Milano from 2019. This new rolling stock is set to become the backbone of the main Italian operatorsâ fleets.\n\nCompared to current fleets operating in Italy, the performance of the Caravaggio EMU is state-of-the-art in terms of transportation capacity, acceleration and speed, reliability, and environmental impact. Moreover, a focus on aesthetic design has given the trains an innovative and recognizable shape that stands out in the current market.\n\nAlso, the trains were developed using the best combination of the technologies available at Hitachi, both in Italy and Japan, and are to be assembled at Hitachiâs Italian plants in Pistoia and Reggio Calabria using technological components manufactured at the Mito and Naples factories.\n\nIn 2019, Okinawa Urban Monorail, Inc. created a plan for extending its service area to include four new stations (Ishimine, Kyozuka, Urasoe-Maeda, and Tedako-Uranishi) and a new electrical substation (Uranishi Substation). As a result, three systems (the traffic management system, power management system, and equipment/firefighting monitoring system) delivered by Hitachi to Okinawa Urban Monorail when it began business in 2003 were recently improved to handle the extended area.\n\nThe improvement work aimed for low-cost completion while maintaining reliability. The power management system and equipment/firefighting monitoring system were rebuilt into a single unified power equipment monitoring system. The system was configured to share some equipment such as networks and printers with the traffic management system.\n\nThe traffic management system was updated to support new distribution of timetable information to broadcast equipment and information displays, and to augment the information provided to passengers. It was also updated to support main line train tracking and automatic depot entry/exit control. Service in the extended area started on October 1, 2019. Until that date, the existing systems were progressively switched over to the new systems as operation in the existing service area is assessed."
