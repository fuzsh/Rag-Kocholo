We are also actively engaged in research and development aimed at reducing railway maintenance costs as well as the development of new materials in consideration of people and the environment, thereby contributing to achieving safer railway transportation. We are involved not only in domestic railway businesses such as railway projects conducted by JR and private railway companies but also in overseas railway businesses. We aim to be a global all-round railway manufacturer that actively marches forward both domestically and internationally while at the same time incorporating state-of-the-art technology."
