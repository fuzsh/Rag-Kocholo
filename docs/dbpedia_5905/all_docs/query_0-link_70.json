        "text": "Updated: Feb. 14, 2022\n\nOhmi Railway Corporation (Ohmi Tetsudo 近江鉄道) (sometimes spelled Omi or Oumi) is a private railway company (subsidiary of Seibu Railway based in Saitama Prefecture) operating a few train lines and bus routes in the interior area of eastern Shiga Prefecture, namely Maibara, Hikone, Higashi-Omi, Hino, and Koka.\n\nThe trains are short, usually only two or three cars, and they run on single tracks. Since Ohmi Railways belong to the Seibu Group, it uses old cars from Seibu Railway in Tokyo. Train cars are normally yellow like on the Seibu Lines, but some cars have colorful and cute custom liveries for Ohmi Railways. Travel time is quite slow. All the trains stop at every station. No express trains.\n\nMost Ohmi Railway stations have no staff. Tickets are instead collected by the train driver if you get off at a station where there is no staff. Only the following terminal stations are always staffed: Maibara, Hikone, Omi-Hachiman, Yokaichi, and Kibukawa. If there is no ticket vending machine at the station where you board the train, take a numbered ticket when you board the train and show it to the train driver when you get off. He can then tell you how much to pay.\n\nThe train line is nicknamed \"Gachakon\" (ガチャコン) which refers to the banging sound it makes on the rails. Ohmi Railway official Website\n\nOn Fri., Sat., Sun., and national holidays (except Dec. 31-Jan. 3), the \"One Day Smile Ticket\" is available for only ¥900 for adults (¥450 for kids) and you can use it to ride the Ohmi Railways all day. A good deal if you plan to ride the Ohmi Railways train at least twice. Showing the ticket to temples and museums along the Ohmi Railways will also give you a discount on the admission. (Details in Japanese here.)\n\nIf you plan to also ride the Shigaraki Kogen Railway on a weekend or national holiday, you should buy the Biwako Keihan-nasen Free ticket (びわこ京阪奈線フリーきっぷ) for unlimited rides on both Ohmi Railways and Shigaraki. Details here.)\n\nAlso, during 9 am - 4 pm, you can bring your bicycle aboard the train at most Ohmi Railways stations except Hikone, Minakuchi Ishibashi, and station from Omi-Hachiman to Shin-Yokaichi. (Details here.)\n\nFor residents, there are more discounts available. If you have a commuter's pass, you can travel beyond your commuter's pass on Ohmi Railways on weekends and national holidays for only ¥100. (Details here.)\n\nOhmi Railways also operate buses (Ohmi Tetsudo Bus and Kokoku Bus) from the larger JR and Ohmi Railway train stations. Most of the buses have the Seibu lion mascot.\n\nThere are three Ohmi Railway train lines:\n\nThe Main Line (Honsen) is the longest, passing through Maibara, Hikone, Higashi Omi (Yokaichi), Hino-cho, and Koka.\n\nThe short Taga Line (Taga-sen) is for people wanting to worship at Taga Taisha Shrine.\n\nThe Yokaichi Line (Yokaichi-sen) connects Yokaichi with Omi-Hachiman Station. The terminal stations are Maibara, Omi-Hachiman, Yokaichi, and Kibukawa.\n\nHistory\n\nOhmi Railways was founded in 1896 because the forerunner of the Tokaido Line which started running in Shiga in 1889 and the now-defunct Kansai Railway running between Kusatsu and Yokkaichi (Mie) never came close to the interior part of eastern Shiga. Ohmi Railways has a close historical connection to Hikone and Hino. The group of 44 people who founded Ohmi Railways Co. consisted of former Hikone samurai and Hino merchants. The first president of Ohmi Railways was a former samurai (Ohigashi Gitetsu 大東義徹) from Hikone, and the second president (Shono Genzo 正野玄三) was a Hino merchant (drug maker).\n\nOhmi Railway's first rail segment opened in June 1898 between Hikone and Echigawa Stations (12.1 km) on the Main Line. A month later, the line was extended to Yokaichi. The line was extended to Kibukawa Station by Dec. 1900. The Taga Line opened between Takamiya and Taga in March 1914. The segment between Hikone and Maibara opened in March 1931. The electrification of train lines started in March 1925 between Hikone and Taga.\n\nIn May 1943, Ohmi Railways becomes part of the Seibu Group with Hakone Tochi (Prince Hotels) taking over business operations. In March 1944, Ohmi Railways merge with Yokaichi Railway which operated the train line between Omi-Hachiman and Shin-Yokaichi Stations. The Yokaichi Line is extended to Yokaichi Station and electrified in Jan. 1946.\n\nEastern Shiga was and still is a rural area, and Ohmi Railways has struggled financially almost from the beginning. It still operates in the red annually and receives subsidies from local governments in eastern Shiga. The company has been racking its brains on how to get more passengers. It has not been very successful.\n\nIn 2019, meetings between the company and local governments were held to decide the fate of the railway. They even compared the costs of converting the railways into bus routes. In the end, they decided to keep Ohmi Railways operating with subsidies from Shiga Prefecture and the five cities and five towns along Ohmi Railway lines. From fiscal 2024, Ohmi Railways will continue to be operated by the private company while being financially supported (¥600–¥700 million per year) by the local governments.\n\nInteresting that the company name of \"Ohmi Railway\" (近江鉄道株式会社) has remained the same since its establishment in 1896. Although the company's ownership has changed twice (currently a subsidiary of Seibu Railways), the company name has remained the same. Only three railway companies in Japan established during the Meiji Period (1868–1912) have retained their original company name. The other two is Tobu Railway Co. in Tokyo and Shimabara Railroad Co. in Nagasaki.\n\nTrain Stations\n\nList of all train stations including transfer lines and popular destinations.
