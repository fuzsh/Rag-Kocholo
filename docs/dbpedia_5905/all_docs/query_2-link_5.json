While doing our best to assure safety and security as our duty to society, we also try to make our services more comfortable with steps such as barrier-free access to stations, and more convenient through mutual use of lines with other railways.\n\nWe organize route networks for buses covering Seibu Railway line stations and neighboring areas and make efforts to improve convenience through operation adapted to local needs. We also operate express buses and bus service to and from airports."
