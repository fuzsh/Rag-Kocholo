        "text": "Running from Shinjuku and Ikebukuro stations through Tokyo's western suburbs and all the way up to Kawagoe and Chichibu in Saitama, the Seibu train lines are great for exploring some of the city's less trendy 'hoods, filled with age-old public baths, run-down shopping arcades and quirky parks, not to mention rowdy izakayas, ethnic eateries and box-sized cafés.\n\nOur complete guide to fun along the Seibu lines takes you from the heart of Tokyo all the way to the historic town of Kawagoe, which features one of the few remaining Edo-period streetscapes, and scenic Chichibu, where you can do things like spend a night in a temple and go river rafting in a traditional wooden boat. Check out our picks below and start exploring – and consider also reading up on 'Aranumano', one of the most interesting areas along the yellow train's tracks.\n\nIt isn't easy to find, but this European-style bakery and café is worth looking for. If you'd like to try before you buy, order the bread set: four varieties served with salad and a drink, making for a fun tasting experience. Parlour Ekoda\n\nA couple of narrow streets host this collection of shops selling fresh produce, sushi, meat and clothing much in the same way as they have been for decades, retaining an authentic downtown vibe. Ekoda Market\n\nAdvertising\n\nSince this bakery opened in 2014, its pastries have inspired long queues, with their croissants, Danish bread and curry rolls selling out long before closing time. Their raspberry Danish is sure to put a smile on your face. Nogata Bread Factory\n\nThis city park is divided into two areas; the lively Okubo section and the quieter Hakoneyama part, which features the tallest 'mountain' inside the Yamanote line loop. The 44.6m-high hill is especially popular in cherry blossom season. Toyama Park\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis is an old-school senbei (rice cracker) shop that's been around since 1933 and is trying to keep up with the times by developing new flavour combinations, for example, a thin cracker wrapped in soft nori seaweed or paired with a combo of nori and cheese. Kintoki Senbei\n\nHead to the Seibu Ikebukuro main store for their impressive new cosmetics counter. Be sure to take advantage of the tax refund service that's available for foreign shoppers. Cosmeannex\n\nAdvertising\n\nNever mind the location (right above a Seven-Eleven) – you’ll forget you’re in Tokyo as soon as you enter this speciality coffee shop, run by a fellow who looks like he could just as well be serving his masterful drip brews in 18th-century Vienna. Café Très Bon\n\nChoose from six varieties of specialty bánh mì – roast beef, pork, chicken, Vietnamese ham and liver paste or prawn and avocado. The bread is crunchy and the pickled vegetables round it off perfectly. Bánh mì Sandwich\n\nAdvertising\n\nSince its 25th annivesary five years ago, Nerima Ward's art museum has been surprising art fans with unique exhibits. See how many quirky animal statues you can spot in the garden. Nerima Art Museum\n\nDomestic firewater from nihonshu and shochu to umeshu and Okinawa's awamori lines the shelves at this liquor store that offers a vast selection of 'one-cup' sake. Shipping service is available for gifts. Ajinomachidaya\n\nThis Israeli restaurant offers one of the best dinner deals in Tokyo. Shamaim's all-you-can-eat course gets you a spread of hummus, falafel, schnitzel, chicken shishlik kebab, pita bread, soup and a variety of small dishes. Shamaim\n\nThis busy eatery has been feeding hungry Nogatans since 1936. Locals often stop by just for a beer, but we recommend filling up on the 'A Set', consisting of fried chicken, ginger pork, miso soup, rice and pickles. Nogata Shokudo\n\nAdvertising\n\nDealing in elaborate homemade sweets, this shop is packed to the rafters with cakes and cookies, but their most popular product is the King potato, a muffin-like creation made with sweet potatoes. Avignon\n\nYou'll be greeted by Jamacan flags, reggae paraphernalia and Bob Marley tunes at Yahman, which serves additive-free ramen (or rahmen, as they call it) and tsukemen. Yahman\n\nAdvertising\n\nA music lounge focusing mainly on progressive rock and other experimental music. Live performances are held almost every night, drawing rock enthusiasts even from overseas. Cafe Flying Teapot\n\nCraving starfruit at 3am? A greengrocer's that stays open around the clock, this shop sells a variety of rare fruits and veg at bargain prices, and is surrounded by an international bunch of retailers dealing in exotic spices and the like. Shinjuku Yaoya\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe bouldering gym offers a comfy setting from the changing rooms to the climbing walls. Choose from beginner, late-night and women-only lessons. Gravity Takadanobaba\n\nAt this warren of Asian restaurants on the roof of an ageing Kabukicho tower block, diners are free to sit at one shop and order food from neighbouring eateries. The free-for-all atmosphere lends itself well to a rowdy night of drinking. Shinjuku Asia Yokocho\n\nAdvertising\n\nOffering traditional Burmese food, Nong Inlay serves a delicious Shan Soba lunch special: a bowl of rice noodles in chicken broth, topped with peanuts and sesame seeds. Or you could brave the Mustard Greens and Pig's Feet Soup. Nong Inlay\n\nSpend a few lazy hours poring over jazz books, magazines or some manga at this sleepy café. Find this hideout on the ground floor of the wood-panelled building next to the Japan Braille Library. Milestone\n\nCustomers are continuously drawn to this homely restaurant for its unique-texture ramen, made by an udon producer in Akita Prefecture. Dining Room Shichisai\n\nRun by some representatives of the Tokyo experimental underground, this weekends-only space in remote Sakuradai specialises in improv and electronica gigs. Pool\n\nAdvertising\n\nA yakitori joint by trade, this spot serves up a nice selection of small sides – try the tuna menchikatsu or the popular liver yakitori, which together are almost enough for an entire meal. Torifuji Kitahara-dori\n\nAt this cosy, convival Thai joint, small plates of food start at ¥350 and staples like phad thai sit alongside more curious dishes. This Ekoda branch features northern Thai tastes, while the one near Nerima Station does flavours from the Isan region. Hyotan\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis largish venue is a little out of the way – a few stops from Ikebukuro – but worth the trip. The main focus is jazz, but tango or prog-rock groups are almost as common. Buddy\n\nEver tried ramen with a chicken or oyster-based soup? The rich flavours mix very well with the noodles, keeping customers coming back for more at this family-friendly spot. Hanaichi\n\nAdvertising\n\nPublic baths in Tokyo are famed for their Mt Fuji murals, but at this one you can also enjoy a projection mapping display while you soak in the natural hot spring. An outdoor bath and a sauna are also available. Hisamatsuyu\n\nStepping out of Nogata Station, look for a blue noren curtain with the word 'yakiton' on it and you'll find Akimotoya, a down-to-earth izakaya specialising in roast giblets (motsuyaki) and miso-dipped skewers. Akimotoya\n\nAdvertising\n\nBoasting a huge pond, happy ducks and pretty shrines, this park is famed for featuring unspoilt nature, plenty of birdlife and ruins of Shakujii Castle. Shakujii Park\n\nKurand Sake Market combines the no-frills atmosphere of a stand bar with a deep passion for Japan's signature spirit. Pay ¥3,240 for unlimited access to around 100 varieties of nihonshu. Also, you can bring your own food. Kurand Sake Market\n\nThis shrine is one of the three main shrines in Chichibu City, and features several rare sculptures that are popular with visitors.
