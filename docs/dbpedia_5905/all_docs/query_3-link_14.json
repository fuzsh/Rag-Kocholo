        "text": "Transport\n\nSeibu Group companies help you get places comfortably based on the concept of “safe and reliable” whether you're in Tokyo, Saitama, Hakone, Izu or Shiga or you want to travel between cities on a highway bus.\n\nWe support our customers’ daily lives and work to provide comfortable service, primarily in the areas where SEIBU Railway lines run in western Tokyo and southwestern Saitama. Our operations connect central urban locations to tourist areas. For example, the Ikebukuro and Seibu-Chichibu lines run from Ikebukuro Station to the Hannō and Seibu-chichibu stations, and the Shinjuku Line runs between the Seibu-shinjuku and Takadanobaba stations and Hon-kawagoe Station. We cover many appealing areas, including Tokorozawa, which is undergoing redevelopment. Moreover, SEIBU Bus operates a fixed-route bus network that branches out from SEIBU Railway stations, and SEIBU HIRE taxis take customers directly to where they want to go.\n\nSince its founding in 1917, IZUHAKONE Railway has been working to enrich the lives of those in the region. In the railway, bus, and taxi transportation business, which is based in the Izu-Hakone area, the company strives daily to meet the transportation needs not only of tourists but also of customers living in the area.\n\nOHMI Railway consists of three lines on the Koto Plain off the eastern coast of Lake Biwa and in Hikone City and Higashiomi City, Shiga. There is also a fixed-route bus network that covers the prefecture targeting regional customers, primarily in the OHMI Railway Lines area. OHMI TAXI provides transportation to customers in the region and also welcomes tourists with taxis decorated with samurai artwork that pays homage to the regional history."
