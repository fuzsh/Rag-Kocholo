        "text": "Seibu Ikebukuro Main Store, a department store in Tokyo, Japan owned by retail company Sogo & Seibu and Seibu Group (Seibu Railway), is to undergo renovations to reopen in 2025.\n\nWith 380 brands and high-quality interior and exterior design, the store aims to create a new face for the Ikebukuro area, one of Tokyo’s multiple city centres which hosts the third largest terminal station in the world.\n\nMoving away from a traditional department store layout segregated by different floors for men and women, Seibu Ikebukuro will unify its customers within gender-neutral spaces.\n\nEach floor of the Seibu Ikebukuro main store will be designed with the architectural concept of “maison”, covering luxury, cosmetics, fashion and a basement deli section with a combined floor space of 48,000m².\n\nThe luxury section will bring together 60 international brands, with the sales floor area 1.3 times larger than its previous size.\n\nThe cosmetics section will offer 60 domestic and international brands, with the sales floor area renovated to be 1.7 times larger than the current size.\n\nThe basement deli section, considered the face of the department store, will feature 180 shops including new brands. It will open in January 2025, with the other floors to follow throughout the year.\n\nSogo & Seibu will also work to strengthen its private sales service and renew its business strategy."
