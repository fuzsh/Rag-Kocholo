        "text": "00:25\n\nWelcome to Japan Railway Journal. This episode is all about monorails.\n\n00:30\n\nA monorail is a transportation system that uses a single rail,\n\n00:33\n\nin which vehicles run either over the rail or under the rail.\n\n00:37\n\nIn 1821, the first patent was granted in the United Kingdom, and that is said to be the first record of such a system.\n\n00:46\n\nIn Japan, the first system was built in 1951, as the ride in the amusement park in western part of Tokyo.\n\n00:55\n\nFrom amusement park to a popular means of transportation.\n\n00:59\n\nLet's take a look at Japanese monorails and the technology behind them.\n\n01:05\n\nThe Tokyo Monorail will celebrate its 60th anniversary in September 2024.\n\n01:14\n\nThe airport access line that connects JR Hamamatsucho Station to Haneda Airport\n\n01:19\n\nwas Japan's first full-scale \"urban transportation\" monorail.\n\n01:28\n\nCurrently, eight companies operate monorails in various locations throughout the country.\n\n01:34\n\nWith a total track length of 114.4 kilometers, Japan is the world's largest monorail nation.\n\n01:48\n\nThe other monorail operating in Tokyo is the Tama Monorail.\n\n01:53\n\nRunning north to south in western Tokyo's Tama region,\n\n01:56\n\nthe monorail serves as a means of transportation for local residents.\n\n02:05\n\nThere are also two monorail operators in Chiba prefecture.\n\n02:11\n\nOne is the Chiba Urban Monorail, which operates two lines out of JR Chiba Station.\n\n02:24\n\nThe other is the Disney Resort Line, which runs between the major theme park's various facilities.\n\n02:36\n\nKanagawa Prefecture's Shonan Monorail, which opened in 1970, is Japan's second oldest after the Tokyo monorail.\n\n02:45\n\nThe line connects Ofuna Station, in Kamakura City, to Enoshima, a popular tourist destination.\n\n02:56\n\nOsaka Monorail operates two lines in the northern part of Osaka prefecture.\n\n03:02\n\nThe total operating distance of 28 kilometers is the longest of all the monorail lines in Japan.\n\n03:12\n\nKitakyushu Monorail, in Fukuoka prefecture, connects the central and suburban areas of Kitakyushu city.\n\n03:26\n\nYui Rail opened in Okinawa prefecture in 2003.\n\n03:32\n\nThis monorail connects the airport to the center of Naha city.\n\n03:44\n\nThere are two types of monorail in Japan.\n\n03:47\n\nOn one, the suspended type, the vehicle is suspended from the rail above.\n\n04:00\n\nOn the other, the straddle type, the vehicle straddles the rail.\n\n04:05\n\nOf Japan's eight operators, six use the straddle type.\n\n04:16\n\nNow let's take a look at the Osaka Monorail, which runs straddle-type monorails.\n\n04:24\n\nOsaka Monorail has a route length of 28 kilometers and a daily ridership of approximately 120,000.\n\n04:34\n\nA third sector company funded by Osaka Prefecture, it originally opened in 1990 with a line just 6.7 kilometers long.\n\n04:45\n\nSince then, the line has been extended five times.\n\n04:49\n\nThe monorail now operates on two lines: the main line, which runs through the northern part of Osaka Prefecture,\n\n04:56\n\nand a branch line that runs out to the suburbs.\n\n05:01\n\nFor the most part, the main line runs above an expressway.\n\n05:09\n\nRailways in Osaka Prefecture are spread out\n\nradially from Osaka City.\n\n05:21\n\nOur company connects these radial railways\n\ninto a loop.\n\n05:34\n\nThe Osaka Monorail intersects with six cities and six other railway lines,\n\n05:39\n\nplaying an important role in Osaka's transportation network.\n\n05:52\n\nAlong the line are residential areas, as well as commercial facilities, universities, an airport, and tourist resources.\n\n06:04\n\nOsaka Monorail, which carries many passengers, has 22-vehicle sets in its rolling stock.\n\n06:13\n\nThe vehicles' structures were researched and developed in Japan.\n\n06:20\n\nThese are the tires for monorail operation.\n\nHere are the running wheel tires.\n\n06:30\n\nThere are the horizontal wheel tires\n\nused for guiding.\n\n06:34\n\nAnd hidden beneath here,\n\nare the stabilizing wheels.\n\n06:43\n\nThe Tokyo Monorail, which opened in 1964, is also a straddle type,\n\n06:49\n\nalthough it's an ALWEG type, which was the world standard at the time.\n\n06:56\n\nOn this type, the tire housing protrudes up into the front and rear of each car,\n\n07:01\n\nso the seats are irregularly placed.\n\n07:11\n\nThe Osaka Monorail, on the other hand, is a Japanese design.\n\n07:18\n\nThe main difference is that the bogie, motor, and tires are all installed under the floor, and the cars are bigger.\n\n07:30\n\nThis means there is more space than the ALWEG type, and the floor is flat.\n\n07:44\n\nThe Japanese-style straddle type monorail is so highly regarded, it's used by the Chongqing Monorail in China,\n\n07:53\n\nthe Daegu Monorail in South Korea,\n\n07:58\n\nand the Palm Jumeirah Monorail in the UAE.\n\n08:08\n\nThe Osaka Monorail is the only straddle-type monorail in Japan that has branch lines.\n\n08:17\n\nAt the station where the main line diverges, you can see the turnouts move and the monorails coming and going in each direction.\n\n08:33\n\nThis sight is mentioned as a \"must-see\" spot on the Osaka Monorail website.\n\n08:51\n\nOne of the biggest differences between a conventional railway and a monorail like this\n\n08:56\n\nis that the turnouts are jointed and motorized.\n\n09:06\n\nBy creating smooth curves with no corners, there are no major jolts or shocks when the vehicle passes through junctions.\n\n09:21\n\nA number of Osaka Monorail's drivers used to drive regular trains.\n\n09:31\n\nTo train new drivers on the particulars specific to monorails, and to familiarize them with one-person operation,\n\n09:38\n\nOsaka Monorail introduced a driving simulator.\n\n09:45\n\nOsaka Monorail is the only company that has such a facility.\n\n09:51\n\nIt's a one-person-operated vehicle, so the\n\ndriver has to open and close the doors.\n\n09:57\n\nThey are open now. I'll close them to depart.\n\n10:03\n\nPassengers are clear.\n\n10:09\n\nNo abnormalities. Doors closed.\n\n10:15\n\nThe monorail is operated using a mass-control handle, just like a regular train.\n\n10:22\n\nPulling the handle causes the monorail to accelerate, while pushing it slows it down.\n\n10:30\n\nMonorails operate on rubber tires.\n\nThey have significant resistance,\n\n10:35\n\nresulting in a tendency to stop abruptly\n\nwithout much inertia.\n\n10:40\n\nThis training facility is designed to simulate\n\nhow to handle such situations.\n\n10:51\n\nUnlike the other companies, Osaka Monorail also runs tourist monorails.\n\n11:04\n\nSince 2023, the Japanese Sake Monorail has run once a month.\n\n11:10\n\nThis train, which is run in cooperation with local governments throughout Japan,\n\n11:15\n\ngives passengers the chance to enjoy sake and food from various regions.\n\n11:23\n\nFor this monorail, a specially wrapped car was used.\n\n11:27\n\nThis wrapped car was created to promote \"Expo 2025\" which is set to be held in Osaka, Kansai, Japan.\n\n11:38\n\nIn January 2024, the Japanese Sake Monorail ran in collaboration with Tottori Prefecture.\n\n11:47\n\nOnboard, Tottori sake was served along with a delicious crab lunchbox.\n\n11:55\n\nAt 4:00 PM, the reception opens at the departure station.\n\n12:01\n\nWith only 130 spots available, tickets sold out quickly.\n\n12:09\n\nPrior to the monorail's departure, a special stage was set up inside the station\n\n12:14\n\nto showcase traditional performing arts from Tottori Prefecture.\n\n12:21\n\nThe tour members get onboard.\n\n12:26\n\n\"Tottori Carnival Monorail!\"\n\n12:28\n\n\"Here we go!\"\n\n12:33\n\nAt 4:40 PM, the monorail departs.\n\n12:36\n\nThere are no restrooms onboard, so it makes occasional stops along the way.\n\n12:44\n\nAs soon as the tour is underway, the participants open their lunch boxes, and begin to feast on the delicious crab meat.\n\n12:56\n\nWhile they are feasting, the participants take part in games where they can win prizes like whole crabs and snacks.\n\n13:06\n\nIt's a lot of fun. So I come here every time.\n\n13:11\n\nIt's not your everyday experience, right? Riding the\n\nmonorail and having drinks together is really fun.\n\n13:26\n\nTwo hours later, after a delicious banquet, the tour comes to an end.\n\n13:36\n\nCurrently, Osaka Monorail is working to extend the line, with completion expected in 2029.\n\n13:46\n\nAlready under construction, the plan is to extend the line beyond Kadoma-shi Station,\n\n13:51\n\ncurrently the easternmost terminus on the main line.\n\n13:58\n\nThe extension will add approximately 9 kilometers to the line.\n\n14:05\n\nOnce the extension is complete, the line will have four additional stations, that connect to other railway lines.\n\n14:16\n\nOne of the main objectives is to expand the\n\ntransportation network, and properly form it.\n\n14:27\n\nOnce railways established, towns\n\nnaturally develop around them.\n\n14:34\n\nSo, the next objective is to revitalize the region.\n\nI think these two are the main points.\n\n14:43\n\nSo the Osaka Monorail is a transportation system that effectively uses the route above a highway.\n\n14:51\n\nYes, and here, there is a very important and also a very generous scheme for the monorail operators,\n\n14:58\n\nbecause the construction cost of the infrastructure for the monorail is basically almost entirely paid by the road budget.\n\n15:09\n\nAnd this scheme is basically part of the effort to cope with the very special transport situation within Japan,\n\n15:19\n\nand this, I think, has prompted the technical development of the monorail system.\n\n15:24\n\nYeah, since you mentioned technical development,\n\n15:26\n\nand it's wonderful to see that Japan developed concept of moving the machinery below the train car,\n\n15:32\n\nthat's making more space in the train car, is now getting adopted at more places around the world.\n\n15:38\n\nAnd I think that's because of the maturity of the system.\n\n15:43\n\nMature in a sense that many monorail operators have been operating the system within Japan for many decades now.\n\n15:51\n\nAnd that is helped by the fact that there is a trust in the Japanese rail industry.\n\n16:00\n\nNext up, let's have a look at the Shonan Monorail, which runs a suspended-type monorail.\n\n16:08\n\nShonan Monorail is a privately-owned monorail company, that opened in 1970.\n\n16:19\n\nOn a suspended-type monorail, the bogies and wheels run inside a box-shaped rail housing.\n\n16:31\n\nThey are connected by a strong device that holds the suspended coaches, each weighing 17 tons.\n\n16:46\n\nAlthough the vehicle sways from side to side while it's in motion, it runs on rubber tires, so it makes less noise.\n\n17:00\n\nIn addition, since the tires and the bogie are enclosed,\n\n17:04\n\nthey are less susceptible to bad weather conditions, such as snow and heavy rain.\n\n17:12\n\nIn the 1960s, as urban areas faced increasingly\n\nsevere traffic congestion issues,\n\n17:19\n\nideas of using monorails emerged as a potential\n\nsolution utilizing both ground and airspace,\n\n17:25\n\npotentially alleviating traffic congestion.\n\n17:31\n\nWith this in mind, Shonan Monorail was\n\nexperimentally established.\n\n17:39\n\nThe Shonan Monorail line runs 6.6 kilometers from Ofuna Station, in Kamakura City,\n\n17:46\n\nto a station near Enoshima, one of Shonan's most popular tourist destinations.\n\n17:56\n\nOfuna Station is also a transfer station for the JR line, so it can be crowded during the morning and evening rush hours.\n\n18:08\n\nThe Shonan Monorail runs eight times an hour, which is approximately every seven to eight minutes.\n\n18:19\n\nThe monorails come frequently.\n\nThey're very convenient.\n\n18:22\n\nGreat view, and my kid loves it.\n\n18:29\n\nOn weekends and holidays, the monorail is especially popular among tourists heading to Enoshima.\n\n18:37\n\nIn recent years, the number of inbound visitors has also increased.\n\n18:43\n\nThe Shonan Monorail runs through an area with many ups and downs.\n\n18:50\n\nSome sections are steeper than any monorail line in Japan.\n\n18:54\n\nHowever, the strong grip of the rubber tires ensures the monorail runs safely.\n\n19:02\n\nOur monorail runs along the edge of the mountains.\n\n19:07\n\nWe refer to it as the Shonan roller coaster.\n\n19:13\n\nShonan Monorail also promotes this thrilling ride on their website.\n\n19:21\n\nIt's actually, like it says, like a roller coaster.\n\n19:24\n\nI didn't realize how much it turns and goes up and down.\n\n19:28\n\nIt's really exciting. I loved it.\n\n19:30\n\nIt's well worth the money.\n\n19:32\n\nIt's very interesting. It was suprising for me.\n\n19:37\n\nLet's take a ride on the 6.6-kilometer-long Shonan Monorail!\n\n19:47\n\nDeparting from Ofuna Station, the monorail takes a wide left, then a right, to arrive at the first station, Fujimi Station.\n\n20:02\n\nFrom Fujimi Station, a straight route of approximately 1 kilometer takes us over a hill.\n\n20:09\n\nThe difference in elevation is about 20 meters.\n\n20:16\n\nGoing down, we come to Shonan-Fukasawa Station.\n\n21:12\n\nRunning downhill again and passing through another tunnel, the train arrives at the terminal, Shonan-Enoshima Station.\n\n21:26\n\nAt Shonan-Enoshima Station, the platform is located on the 5th floor of the building.\n\n21:33\n\nDirectly opposite the ticket gate is a rooftop terrace.\n\n21:42\n\nFrom the terrace, Mt. Fuji can be seen towering in the distance.\n\n21:49\n\nThis location is a popular spot for photos of Japan's most famous mountain.\n\n21:56\n\nTransportation systems have the role of safely\n\ndelivering passengers to their destinations.\n\n22:04\n\nThat said, we aim to take it a step further by\n\npromoting the appeal of Shonan Monorail.\n\n22:13\n\nWe want riding our monorail to become a unique\n\nexperience, akin to riding a roller coaster.\n\n22:26\n\nLooks like you're in for an exciting ride on the Shonan Monorail, going up and down, through a tunnel, just like a roller coaster.\n\n22:34\n\nActually the construction of the Shonan Monorail was intended also as the showcase for future sales of the system,\n\n22:40\n\nwhich was successful when the Chiba Urban Monorail adopted the system and opened in 1988.\n\n22:48\n\nSince the monorail runs at high elevation you get that spectacular view from above, unless you're scared of height.\n\n22:55\n\nYes, and as the transport system, the monorail has no CO2 emissions at least on site, and also it's free of traffic jam.\n\n23:05\n\nSo I would like to see more projects adopting the monorail system in many different parts of the world.\n\n23:13\n\nYes.\n\n23:15\n\nNext up is Tourist Trains in Style, where we introduce amazing tourist trains from all across Japan.\n\n23:30\n\nFifty Two Seats of Happiness is a tourist train operated by Seibu Railway.\n\n23:38\n\nOn this restaurant train, passengers enjoy an authentic course meal onboard.\n\n23:44\n\nFrom Tokyo to Chichibu, they offers a brunch course, and a dinner course from Chichibu back to Tokyo.\n\n23:58\n\nThe name \"fifty two seats of happiness\" comes from the sense of relaxation and luxury, that can be felt on the 52-seat train.\n\n24:09\n\nThe body of the four-car train depicts the four seasons and the natural landscape of Chichibu.\n\n24:19\n\nThe ceiling inside the car was also creatively designed.\n\n24:25\n\nUsing Japanese washi paper, it expresses the beauty of the valley.\n\n24:34\n\nAnd the flow of the river is expressed using locally-sourced timber.\n\n24:43\n\nCars 2 and 4 are the dining cars.\n\n24:50\n\nWith tables for four and two people, each of the spacious cars has just 26 seats.\n\n25:01\n\nCar 3 is a dedicated kitchen car.\n\n25:06\n\nThrough the glass windows, passengers can see how the food is prepared.\n\n25:20\n\nToday, we're taking the dinner-course train.\n\n25:26\n\nAt 4:12 PM, the train departs Seibu-Chichibu Station, bound for Seibu-Shinjuku Station.\n\n25:37\n\nShortly after departing, the attendants serve welcome drinks.\n\n25:45\n\nThe first dish arrives.\n\n25:48\n\nHere's an appetizer, highlighting the natural flavors\n\nof locally grown vegetables.\n\n25:57\n\nThe menu, which changes with the seasons, is overseen by a renowned chef.\n\n26:07\n\nPassengers look out on the scenery, while enjoying food made with ingredients from along the line.\n\n26:20\n\nOnboard, a duet performs live.\n\n26:26\n\nEvery dinner course is accompanied by live music.\n\n26:40\n\nThis is an extraordinary and totally relaxing\n\nexperience. I'm glad I came here.\n\n26:49\n\nI'm impressed with the dishes with local ingredients.\n\nI feel like being treated by the locals.\n\n27:01\n\nAbout 2 hours and 20 minutes later, the train arrives at the final stop, Seibu-Shinjuku station."
