Within the four operating companies, the S-Train is the first-ever reserved-seat train to operate on the Tokyu and Minatomirai railways.[3]\n\nThe name \"S-Train\" was used by the 4 companies during trademark registration on 21 November 2016, and has been trademarked since 21 April 2017 (No. 5941839). The \"S\" in \"S-Train\" stands for the following:[2]\n\nScene: Used in different scenarios, like commuting to work, going to school or going on outings\n\nSeat: Comfortable reserved seats\n\nSeamless: Seamless journey thanks to through service without interchange\n\nSeibu\n\nThe logo has three different colours, each with unique meanings. The upper part of the \"S\" is coloured green, signifying the greenery alongside the Chichibu Line; the lower part of the \"S\" is coloured blue, signifying the Minatomirai Line, whose signature colour is also blue; and the text \"S-TRAIN\" is grey, signifying the urbanisation around Shibuya and Toyosu, which the train serves.[2]\n\nIn terms of service type, the S-Train is uniquely positioned. It is positioned lower than Seibu's limited express (the Red Arrow) on the Seibu service hierarchy, but is placed higher than Tokyu's limited express (which does not charge extra fees) in Tokyu's service hierarchy.\n\nTrain operation differs between weekdays and weekends.\n\nThe direction is denoted by \"Up\" and \"Down\", where trains for Toyosu or Motomachi-Chukagai are \"up\" and trains for Chichibu or Tokorozawa are \"down\". This is based on Seibu's standards, in which southbound services are \"up\", and northbound services are \"down\". The S-Train follows Seibu's standards because it is the main operator of the service. A further reason for using Seibu's standards is to prevent confusion, as Tokyo Metro and Tokyu use reversed denotations of service direction compared to Seibu.\n\nSince all seats on the S-Train are reserved, there are special conductors (specially called \"Train Crew\" within Tokyu sections) to make sure passengers have purchased seat reservations. Because of this, the S-Train differs from regular Tokyo Metro services, as all S-Train services use driver-only operation.[citation needed]\n\nOn weekdays, S-Trains operate mainly to serve commuters. They run between Tokorozawa and Toyosu, on the Seibu Ikebukuro and Yurakucho Lines, and the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line.\n\nThere are 6 Toyosu-bound trains and 5 Tokorozawa-bound trains every weekday. S-Trains operate during the evening rush hours, except for one Toyosu-bound train which operates in early morning.\n\nThe biggest feature of the weekday S-Trains is that it skips Ikebukuro Station, which is a core transfer terminal on the Seibu Ikebukuro and Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Lines, and is Tokyo Metro's busiest station. Another feature is that it operates as a limited stop service within the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line.\n\nS-Trains stop at Tokorozawa, Hoya, Shakujii-Koen on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, and at Iidabashi, Yurakucho, Toyosu on the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line.\n\nOn weekends, S-Train services operate mainly to serve visitors. They run between Seibu-Chichibu and Motomachi-Chukagai, on the Seibu Chichibu and Yurakucho Lines, the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, the Tokyu Toyoko Line, and the Minatomirai Line. The section is 113.8 kilometres (70.7 mi) long, which is the longest distance of any Tokyo Metro through train service.\n\nThere are 2 southbound trains (one originating from Seibu-Chichibu, the other from Hanno, all for Motomachi-Chukagai), and 3 northbound trains (one to Tokorozawa, one to Hanno, and one for Seibu-Chichibu, all originating from Motomachi-Chukagai) per day on weekends.\n\nThe southbound train from Hanno and the northbound train to Seibu-Chichibu are the only weekend S-Trains that operate in the morning. All other S-Trains operate in the evening.\n\nPassengers cannot board S-Trains at Ikebukuro.\n\nLegend\n\n◯ : Stops\n\n△ : Stops, boarding for northbound trains only\n\n▽ : Stops, boarding for southbound trains only\n\n◇ : Stops, alighting only\n\n※ : Brief stop, no boarding or alighting\n\nRoute Station S-Train Connections and Notes Station No. Name Japanese Seibu Ikebukuro Line System[* 1] SI19 Kotesashi 小手指 ◇ SI18 Nishi-Tokorozawa 西所沢 ◇ SI17 Tokorozawa 所沢 ▽ Seibu Shinjuku Line (SS22) SI12 Hoya 保谷 ▽ SI10 Shakujii-Kōen 石神井公園 ▽ SI06 Nerima 練馬 ◇ (Brief stop to switch between ATS and ATC systems) SI37Y06 Kotake-Mukaihara 小竹向原 ※ (Brief stop to switch crew members) Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line Y13 Iidabashi 飯田橋 △ T Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line (T-06)\n\nN Tokyo Metro Namboku Line (N-10)\n\nE Toei Ōedo Line (E-06)\n\nJB JR East Chūō-Sōbu Line (JB 16)\n\nY18 Yurakucho 有楽町 △ H Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line (H-07 at Hibiya Station)\n\nC Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line (C-09 at Hibiya Station)\n\nI Toei Mita Line (I-08 at Hibiya Station)\n\nJY JR East Yamanote Line (JY 30)・JK Keihin-Tohoku Line (JK 25)\n\nY22 Toyosu 豊洲 ◯ Yurikamome (U-16)\n\nLegend\n\n◯ : Stops\n\n△ : Stops, boarding for northbound trains only\n\n▽ : Stops, boarding for southbound trains only\n\n◇ : Stops, alighting only\n\n※ : Brief stop, no boarding or alighting\n\nRoute Station S-Train Connections and Notes Station No. Name Japanese Seibu Ikebukuro Line System[* 2] SI36 Seibu-Chichibu 西武秩父 ◯ Chichibu Railway (Ohanabatake Station) SI26 Hanno 飯能 ◯ SI23 Irumashi 入間市 ◯ SI17 Tokorozawa 所沢 ◯ Seibu Shinjuku Line (SS22) SI10 Shakujii-Kōen 石神井公園 ◯ SI06 Nerima 練馬 ※ (Brief stop to switch between ATS and ATC systems) SI37F06 Kotake-Mukaihara 小竹向原 ※ (Brief stop to switch crew members) Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line F09 Ikebukuro 池袋 ◇ M Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line (M-25)\n\nY Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line (Y-09)\n\nJY JR East Yamanote Line (JY 13)\n\nJA JR East Saikyo Line (JA 12)・JS Shonan-Shinjuku Line (JS 21)\n\nTJ Tobu Tojo Line (TJ-01)\n\nSeibu Ikebukuro Line (SI01)\n\nF13 Shinjuku-sanchome 新宿三丁目 ◯ M Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line (M-09)\n\nS Toei Shinjuku Line (S-02)\n\nF16TY01 Shibuya 渋谷 ◯ G Tokyo Metro Ginza Line (G-01)・ Z Hanzomon Line (Z-01)\n\nJY JR East Yamanote Line (JY 20)\n\nJA JR East Saikyo Line (JA 10)・JS Shonan-Shinjuku Line (JS 19)\n\nDT Tokyu Den-en Toshi Line (DT01)\n\nKeio Inokashira Line (IN01)\n\nTokyu Toyoko Line TY03 Naka-Meguro 中目黒 ※ (Brief stop) TY07 Jiyugaoka 自由が丘 ◯ OM Tokyu Oimachi Line (OM10) TY11 Musashi-Kosugi 武蔵小杉 ※ (Brief stop) TY16 Kikuna 菊名 ※ (Brief stop) TY21 Yokohama 横浜 △ JT JR East Tokaido Line (JT 05)・ JO Yokosuka Line (JO 13)・JS Shonan-Shinjuku Line (JS 13)\n\nJK JR East Keihin-Tohoku Line (JK 12)・JK Negishi Line (JK 12)・ JH Yokohama Line (JH 12)\n\nKK Keikyu Main Line (KK37)\n\nSotetsu Main Line (SO01)\n\nYokohama Municipal Subway Blue Line (B20)\n\nMinatomirai Line Minatomirai みなとみらい △ Motomachi-Chukagai 元町・中華街\n\n（山下公園）\n\n◯\n\nSeibu 40000 series 10-car EMUs\n\nF Liner, a similar service to the weekend S-Train"
