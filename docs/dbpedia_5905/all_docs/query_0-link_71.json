        "text": "Owners of the Tokyo Prince Hotel Park Tower spared no expense in building the 33-story, 673-room luxury property in downtown Tokyo. The $284 million hotel, which opened in April, offers guests everything from an in-house hot spring spa to spectacular views of city landmark Tokyo Tower. Its most expensive suite costs $9,300 a night. But the Park Tower's opulence is now of little value to the company that built it, Seibu Railway Co. Seibu is in so much financial trouble it's mulling sales of some other hotel properties to make ends meet. And vulture investors, including foreign banks, are circling over the whole company, eyeing assets like the Park Tower.\n\nSeibu, the hub of a business empire built by Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who in 1990 was dubbed the world's richest man by Forbes magazine, has fallen on mighty hard times. Last year the company posted an $81 million loss, saw the ouster of Chairman Tsutsumi, 70, under a cloud of scandal, and was expelled from the Tokyo Stock Exchange for underreporting stakes owned by its top shareholders."
