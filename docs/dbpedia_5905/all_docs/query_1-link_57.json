        "text": "What motivated you to come to Japan and what was the purpose of your stay?\n\nHow long have you lived in Japan?\n\nI came to Japan in October 2022, so it’s been a year since I arrived. (I studied Japanese for three months in China before coming here.)\n\nWhy did you choose to live along the Seibu Line?\n\nBefore coming to Japan, I left the arrangements to a study abroad agency, with instructions to avoid first-floor apartments, look for affordable rent, and ensure good access to school. While properties around Shin-Okubo Station were also recommended, I chose the one near Shimo-Ochiai Station because it was closer to the station (a 2-minute walk).\n\nWhat do you like about the station near where you live?\n\nAny favorite spots around the station where you live?\n\nYou likely use the Seibu Line to commute. How convenient is it for you?"
