        "text": "It’s been 50 years since renowned manga artist-duo Fujiko Fujio published their series on the beloved cat-robot Doraemon, which has now grown to become one of the most iconic Japanese characters of our time. Though Doraemon continues to appear in his own TV and film adaptations, the all resourceful blue cat-robot has transcended the world of anime with his own line of dedicated merchandise, his own section and ride at Universal Studios Japan, and now a new themed train in Tokyo.\n\nJust last week, Seibu Railway unveiled the ‘Doraemon Go!’ train, which will run on the transport company's Shinjuku, Tamako and Haijima lines. The special-edition eight-carriage train is of course, blue, with its plush seats emblazoned with Doraemon’s famous bottomless pocket. That’s not all: the doors that lead to the other carriages are also decorated with the pink frame of the mysterious dokodemo door, which often appears in the manga and anime series as a portal that could transport the users to anywhere they desire.\n\nYou’ll know when you’re about to board the Doraemon train as it approaches the platform. The front of the train features the character’s red button nose and whiskers; there’s also a Doraemon plushie seated behind the glass acting as the conductor. You can also track the train’s timetable via the Seibu Railway app if you want to make sure you catch it that day.\n\nThe Doraemon train is already in operation and Seibu Railway says it will continue to run until further notice.\n\nMore from Time Out\n\nThis new bamboo forest glamping site in Chiba has resident giraffes\n\nKabutocho in Nihonbashi is named Tokyo’s coolest neighbourhood right now\n\nJR Kyushu's new luxury train offers sightseeing tours to the island's top destinations\n\nWorld’s first Godzilla theme park is now open in Hyogo"
