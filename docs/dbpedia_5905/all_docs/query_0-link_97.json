        "text": "So I came across this headline when I was doing some looking into what dumbleton hall was going to be used in japan (presumably a static exhibit in the harry potter studio tour in development there).\n\nHowever for a moment a thought came to my head that they were gonna restore dumbleton hall and shuttle the loco between two stations!\n\nOne of which will have hogsmead styling and the other kings cross styling.\n\nHowever with my sensible hat on, most Japanese railways are narrow gauge so that from the get go rules it out!\n\nIf only they did that would be a sight to see!\n\nTwo Tokyo train stations were given a Harry Potter transformation\n\nToshimaen and Ikebukuro stations were given a magical makeover before the opening of Tokyo's new Harry Potter attraction\n\nToshimaen Station will be getting the full treatment. A new two-storey structure will be built into the station, along with a dark red train platform reminiscent of Hogsmeade train station, where the Hogwarts Express ends its journey.\n\nThe second station getting a magical makeover is the Ikebukuro Station, which people frequently pass through to get to Toshimaen. Sections of the station that will be transformed include platforms one and two, which are mainly used for trains servicing Toshimaen. The two platforms will be modelled on London’s King’s Cross train station, where Hogwarts pupils are waved off by their parents at the beginning of every school term. Think brown brick facades and analog clocks.\n\nThis Japanese language article from the official Seibu Railway website has an image of the wrapping which will be used on the trains on the service:\n\nhttps://www.seiburailway.jp/newsroom/news/20230307_studiotourtokyoexpress/\n\nEnglish language translation of the article through DeepL Translate:\n\nSeibu Railway Company (Head office: Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture; President: Kimio Kitamura) has decided to operate the \"Studio Tour Tokyo Express\", a fully wrapped train featuring the main cast of the \"Harry Potter\" films, for the opening of the \"Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo - Making of Harry Potter\" (\"Studio Tour Tokyo\") in summer 2023.\n\nThe train depicts the world of the Harry Potter films simply and to the fullest by boldly depicting the three main cast members - Harry, Hermione and Ron - against the backdrop of the Forbidden Forest, which appears in the Harry Potter films. The design will be enjoyed by residents of the railway line and visitors to the Studio Tour Tokyo, and the three 20000 Series trains will be decorated with this design. The service is scheduled to commence from May 2023. Details on the start date will be announced as soon as they have been decided.\n\nThe wrapping train will create a sense of anticipation and excitement about the Studio Tour Tokyo, and will also create a lively atmosphere along the railway line by communicating the attractions of the newly opened facility to residents living along the railway line, and will help to reduce congestion and environmental impact around Studio Tour Tokyo by encouraging train use. Seibu Railway will contribute to the creation of a better environment for customers visiting the area around Toshimaen Station and residents living along the railway line.\n\nSeibu Railway will continue to work with the local authorities along the route and Warner Bros. Studios Japan LLC, the operator of Studio Tour Tokyo, to revitalise the area around Toshimaen Station in preparation for the opening of Studio Tour Tokyo.\n\nHarry Potter is very popular round the world, it was a matter of time before Japan is going to introduce a similar theme.\n\nI have been fortunate to visit the Universal Studios in Florida, where they have set up Hogwarts with all typical London landmarks, King's Cross, British style station, Diagon Alley, triple decker bus and Hogsmeade utilising the artic village theme with a connecting train based on the film and they have done a fantastic job of it.\n\nAlso visited the film studio at Watford which is a very interesting attraction in its own right.\n\nTokyo hopefully will do just as good a job of it.\n\nIts Nihon=Japan, so it will be much more ´kawaii´= nice to look at, a little funny, mostly enchanting to young girls.\n\nThese private railways in Japan, of which there are quite a lot, and they are indeed private (but loose money on trains, compensated by their other activities, Seibu is great in deptmt. stores), make all kind of gimmmicks to try to attract passengers who just come to see it and thus pay for a ticket, not just the 10000s of daily commuters who come anyway (in the main metro areas then). And as it is Japan, there will likely be some listing of all stops/stations decked out in some theme. It is a long time ago since I was there, but I remember then there was a minor stop on the most northern island, Hokkaido, all decked out to promote the local cows and the very special excellent milk these beasts there produce over there (milk is a non-Japan food thing, but to a dutchman not overly unknown)."
