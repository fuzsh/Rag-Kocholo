        "text": "Randolph (Randy) Edward Howson went home to Jesus on July 8, 2024, after battling cancer. Randy was born in Dayton, Ohio on May 14, 1950, the son of Ernest and Wilma Howson before moving to Riverside where he grew up.\n\nRandy honorably served in the U.S. Army from 1968-1989, participating in the Vietnam war, earning many awards and medals that include a Purple Heart and 2 Bronze Stars. After retiring from the Army, he was employed as a civilian with the government in many locations including the Pentagon for a number of years, retiring again from service in 2015 at WPAFB. In his retirement, Randy continued to serve in the Military Order of the Purple Heart, including holding the position of Commander and working diligently to make Wright-Patterson Air Force Base the first active-duty military base in America to be designated as a Purple Heart Base, until his illness precluded his further participation. He was a true patriot to his core, serving his country in ways that most will never truly know.\n\nThroughout his life, Randy was an athlete who enjoyed playing all sports, but baseball and golf were among his passions. He was also a very talented and accomplished musician, mastering the piano, guitar, and drums.\n\nRandy is survived by his high school sweetheart and wife of 54 years, Patty; son RJ Howson and his children, Emily and Noah; son Todd Howson and his wife, Megan, their children Jakob, Katie and Caleb, and their grandchildren Roman, Denver, and June; and daughter Heather and her husband, David Whittridge, and their children Rachael and Benjamin; brother, Paul Howson, sister, Sherry Howson as well as numerous other family members and friends. Randy is preceded in death by his parents and siblings Ron Howson and David Howson. Randy was a loving husband, brother, dad, and papaw. He is missed by his beloved dog, Bella.\n\nA celebration of Randy’s life will be held on Sunday, July 14, 2024, at Agape Family Worship Center located at 4111 Mapleview Dr., Beavercreek, Ohio, 45432. Visitation will be held from 5:30-6:00pm with the service starting immediately after.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be given to Agape Family Worship Center at agapefwc.org/giving/ or Samaritan’s Purse at samaritanspurse.org.\n\nTo share a memory of Randy or leave a special message for his family, please click visit the Guestbook below."
