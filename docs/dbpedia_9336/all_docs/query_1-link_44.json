        "text": "What equipment/instruments do you use?\n\n\"For the Windborne Music shows, I play DW drums and use various snare drums from Ludwig, Tama, Yamaha, Slingerland, Pearl, and DW. I'm really excited to be playing Dream Cymbals exclusively now. They have cymbals to fit any and all of my playing situations from an Eagles ballad to an explosive Zep tune. These cymbals deliver the goods every time! I also use DW drums, remo heads and Vic Firth sticks.\"\n\nWho are some of your musical influences:\n\n\"I started being interested in the drums after seeing the drum section in the hometown parade. After that I saw Buddy Rich on TV and that made a big impression on me. After I started drumming I got into John Bonham, Keith Moon (I watched \"the kids are alright\" movie over and over),Peter Criss from Kiss, Buddy Rich, Neil Piert, Stewert Copeland from the Police, Terry Bozzio from Frank Zappa,Missing Persons, and UK. I also liked alot of Funk and Rand B drumming like Average White Band, Earth Wind and FIre, James Brown and Parliment Funkadelic. There are so many bands that influenced me in all styles it's hard to include them all. I would play drums to anything we had around the house. In college I got into more Jazz and fusion drummers like Dave Weckl, Dennis Chambers, Max Roach. On the Led zep DVD John Bonham starts his drum solo by playing a Max Roach solo idea. I can tell John Bonham listened to alot of Jazz and Big Band drummers.\""
