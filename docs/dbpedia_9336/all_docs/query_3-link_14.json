        "text": "LDP: Paul, surely you’re what anyone could call an eclectic musician. In your music career you have broadened out amongst the genres with a great deal of competence. How did you approach to music?\n\nPR: First, thank you for taking notice. I was raised amongst creative and artistic people, my earliest memories are of music. My father played trombone, was studying classical guitar when I was born, and photography. His father was a singer and dancer who was dance partners with Sarah Vaughn. My great grandfather was a master electrician, owned a recording studio that cut straight to vinyl, and led a marching band that performed German “ump pa pa” music. My mother sang in church growing up and studied piano for a bit. My grandmother graduated from an arts school in New Jersey and went on to become an accomplished seamstress who loved all styles of music. My godmother is a clothing designer. I heard classical, slow drag (doo wop), rock n roll, rhythm and blues, blues, bossa nova, Afro Cuban, and African styles. When I was able to go to the record store and purchase music and music magazines, I dove even deeper, and have never stopped. I began studying music at the age of 7 while living in Sao Paulo Brasil. At that time I was playing guitar and percussion, it wasn’t until age 14 that I took up bass.\n\nLDP: You are a multi-instrumentalist and a vocalist. As far as electric bass and generally, music, which were your main influences?\n\nPR: Roots music i.e., blues, rhythm and blues, rock n roll, funk, jazz and later other genres.\n\nLDP: Your solo works have always been really fascinating and full of proposals. Have you planned any other release under your name? Can you anticipate to me anything about it?\n\nPR: I have 2 records I’m shopping in 2016 that are stylistically opposites….well…at least I think so, LOL!\n\nLDP: Your resume is very impressive, it’s so full of collaborations. Tony Allen, your experience with Jazzanova, DJ Kawasaki, Charles Webster and your friend Amp Fiddler, Zed Bias, J Dilla, Trus'Me, Kiko Navarro amongst the others, crossing funky, dance, pop and electronic music. Which were the experiences that have enriched you most?\n\nPR: All of them!\n\nLDP: Much is being said on the record industry market and generally on the music one. What’s your opinion about that?\n\nPR: If you understand the definition of “industry” and “market” then they are both functioning well in a dynamic and ever changing world.\n\nLDP: Is there, in your view, a levelling down of the audience profile towards a music too consumer oriented? Is there a loss of curiosity that many critics find in the audience?\n\nPR: This is a difficult question to answer. With no consumers there is no industry, no music to exploit, and nothing for critics to write about. I also believe this topic is a matter of perspective: If you are referring to “Popular Music” then there are other variables to consider. The prefix “pop” comes from the word populous, meaning music for the masses, the question is who decides who that “target market” is comprised of. The answer is of course industry. Society has become complacent, we want everything hot and now, immediate gratification with no real effort. Those who rely on popular consensus i.e., magazines, television, and social media for information, are at the mercy of the proven, efficient, marketing formulas the industry has in place to sell products and services.\n\nPopular music does not include all music, so it is up to the consumer to find new resources on their own. With the internet we now have access to the world, new ways for music to be distributed and marketed on every level, particularly independent. Can you tell I graduated from college with a marketing degree?\n\nLDP: Would you like to talk about your gear? Do you collect electric basses?\n\nPR: I have 8 basses ranging from electric to acoustic, my 2 oldest are an original Aria Pro and an ESP I bought the first time I went to Japan, which I customized and still play to this day. Amp-wise I have 2 vintage Kustom amps that I love, an Ashdown, and EBS system. I have an array of pedals that I use according to my mood and the music I’m performing.\n\nLDP: I mention you some names. Larry Graham, Louis Johnson, James Jamerson, Verdine White, Chuck Rainey, Jerry Jemmott, Marcus Miller, Jaco... who are the bassists whom you feel closest to, amongst the ones cited above? Today is there any bassist with whom you feel a kind of kinship and whom you like most?\n\nPR: All of them. I have to combine this list with past influences as well: Pino Palladino, Tony Levin, Thundercat, Norwood Fisher, Gail Ann Dorsey, Meshell Ndegeocello, Tal Wilkenfeld, Marion Hayden, Doug Wimbish, Doug Pinnick, Colin Moulding, Percy Jones, Bruce Thomas, Billy Cox, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Bootsy, Cordell “Boogie” Mosson, Chris Squire, Jack Bruce, Mark King, Randy Jackson, P-Nut, Paul Jackson, Fernando Sanders, Ralphe Armstrong, Stuart Zender, Lee Sklar, Bobby Vega, Carmine Rojas, Jimmy Haslip…far too many to mention and too important to forget.\n\nLDP: I have a memory related to “Lonely Eden”, when I worked in a record store. It was one of the albums that I played most in airplay. People stopped and they asked me: “Say, that’s amazing! What’s that? Maybe funky, soul, house, rock, or what? We got all kinds in this sound. How can you manage, when you’re composing, all that variety of influences?\n\nPR: I don’t think about it. I just engage, surrender to the moment, and follow my instincts all the way through to the end of the creative process.\n\nLDP: By referring to the previous question, can I ask you to participate freely in our usual desert island records game? Which records would you take with you without limits as regards number and genres?\n\nPR: Oh man lets see….. Jimi Hendrix “A Band of Gypsies” and “Axis Bold as Love”, Vince Guaraldi “A Charlie Brown Christmas”, Weather Report “Mr. Gone” and “Black Market”, Howlin’ Wolf “Electric Blues”, Nessun Dorma, Parliament Live, Led Zepplin “Blackdog” Fishbone, 311 “Music”, Rage Against the Machine “Renegades”, Prince “Dirty Mind” and “Controversy”, Bill Bruford “Gong”, Gino Vannelli “Brother to Brother”, King Crimson “Discipline”, Thomas Dolby “Flat Earth” and “Aliens ate my buick”, Santana/Buddy Miles Live, Police “Zenyatta Mondatta”, Grace Jones “Slave to the Rhythm”, David Sancious “True Stories” and “The Bridge”, Los Lobos “Colossal Head”, Buddy Guy “Sweet Tea”, AC/DC “Black in Black” Queens of the Stone Age “Songs For The Deaf”, Marvin Gaye ‘What’s going on”, Lenny White “Astral Pirates”, OURS “Distorted Lullabies”, U2 “Boy”, Missing Persons “ Spring Session M”, anything by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Billy Withers, Phoebe Snow, Ella, Elis Regina, Sarah Vaughan, Nat King Cole, Billy Strayhorn, Aretha Franklin, Joni Mitchell, Ofra Haza, Miles, Coltrane, Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Billy Preston, Horace Siver, Ruth Brown, Wynonie Harris, Carole King, Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, XTC, James Brown, Brand X, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Return To Forever, Jeff Buckley, Gil Evans, Fela, Ali Farka Toure, David Bowie, Bad Brains, Death, Oliver Lake, Thelonious Monk, Dr. John, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Morphine, Al Green, Otis Redding, Youssou N’Dour, R.L.

I could keep going!\n\nLDP: Solo albums aside, is expected any new release together with other artists in 2016?\n\nPR: Yes, and a few surprises!\n\nLDP: Who’s Paul beyond music? Do you cultivate any interests, passions or hobbies? As regards sport, what do you prefer to follow or play?\n\nPR: I like to cook, travel, socialize, dance, watch classic movies, Italian red wines, I’m a Sci-Fi fan, I want to start painting and experimenting with another art form. I workout a lot but honestly am not a dedicated sports fan; however, I do like track and field for its raw energy.\n\nLDP: Can we hope to see you here in Italy sooner or later? Please, welcome your huge number of Italian fans…\n\nPR: I’ll do my best. Ciao\n\n​Luca De Pasquale-Manuela Avino 2015"
