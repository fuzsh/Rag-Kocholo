        "text": "Jimmie Bones is most widely known as the longtime keyboardist, backing vocalist for Kid Rock and the Twisted Brown Trucker Band as well as being a solo artist, singer/songwriter. Delivering soulful vocal melodies backed by his driving piano and his band The Snakebit Wanderers, Jimmie Bones delivers an electrifying roots rock n roll, straight outta the blues and soul sound. Drawn to music at a very young age Bones broke away from a few years of formal keyboard training which began at age ten and immersed himself in the music that spoke to him. His classroom was anywhere that had a piano and a record player and his professors were the early Blues, R & B Soul, and Rock and Roll records that Jimmie was and is still addicted to.\n\nJimmie Bones was born James Trombly in Detroit, Michigan at a time when both the automobile and the music industries were thriving there. The \"Motor City\" gave a name to a record label called MOTOWN that would impact pop culture forever and leave a profound impact on the heart, soul and ears of a young kid who would later become known as Jimmie Bones. The radio was always playing and Jimmie was not only hearing the R & B Soul of the time but also the sounds that the world was falling in love with coming from the \"British Invasion\" lead by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Bones was drawn right in with everyone else which eventually lead to exploration of what those groups were influenced by which was the Blues and early roots Rock and Roll.\n\nBy the time Jimmie entered high school he was playing gigs with other musicians at local VFW and high school teen dances, basement and garage parties and anywhere else Bones and company could set up and jam. Soon Jimmie began to gig in the Detroit club scene and found himself not only fronting his own band Jimmie Bones and the Graverobbers but also being called upon to record and do shows with many Detroit acts as a sideman keyboardist. This lead Bones into a stint as part of the backing band for an artist signed by RCA records named Robert Bradley. Bones tracked on the debut record and toured with Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise. It was during the sessions for the first Robert Bradley record that Jimmie met a young artist who was working on one of his own independent releases in that same studio. That young artist who went by the name of Kid Rock asked Jimmie to lay some piano tracks and soon cover the keyboards on some live shows. In time Bones would eventually become Kid Rock's full time keyboardist both recording and touring as a member of The Twisted Brown Trucker Band. Bones began contributing backing vocals and harmonica as well as co-writing credits with Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker. Jimmie's co-writes include Kid Rock releases She’s Your Baby (Now Rock Her) which was co-written with Loretta Lynn, Cowboy, Black Bob, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Do It For You, Jackson Mississippi, and Uncle Kracker songs Yeah Yeah Yeah, Better Days, and You Can't Take Me, from his multi platinum debut Double Wide. Bones also contributed heavily throughout Uncle Kracker's Double Wide on keyboards and backing vocals notably the B-3, Wurlitzer, and backing vocals on the hit single \"Follow Me\". Bones has taken his wood shed, street level musical education with him into a career that has found him onstage and in the studio with not only Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker but also Bob Seger, Peter Wolf, Gordon Lightfoot, Sheryl Crow, Billy Gibbons, R. L. Burnside, Hank Williams Jr., Beth Hart, Mark Farner, Brad Whitford, Derek St. Holmes, Dick Wagner, Donald Kinsey and many others.\n\nAs a singer/songwriter and recording artist Jimmie Bones released his debut solo record 'Snakebit and Wandering' in 2017 on Funky D Records. Produced by Martin 'Tino' Gross, 'Snakebit and Wandering' is a mix of Bones' blues, soul, roots rock and roll influences poured into his gritty singing, playing, and songwriting. Snakebit and Wandering earned Jimmie two Detroit Music Awards for ‘Outstanding Songwriter’ and ‘Outstanding Rock Recording’. Jimmie has also received Detroit Music Awards for ‘Outstanding Pop/Rock Instrumentalist’, Outstanding Blues Intrumentalist’, and ‘Outstanding RnB Artist/Group’ for his work with Detroit’s Howling Diablos. Tino Gross and Jimmie Bones are the pair who collaborated on the critically acclaimed R. L. Burnside release 'A Bothered Mind' on Fat Possum Records. In 2020 Jimmie Bones released two new singles, the emotional and sentimental ‘Bittersweet’ and the soulful, gospel piano driven ‘Through Hell For Heaven’s Sake’.\n\nJimmie works closely with the Dick Wagner “Remember The Child” Memorial Fund which provides music therapy and musical instruments to hospitalized children. Along with performing on keyboards in several Dick Wagner Memorial Concerts Jimmie is featured in the charity’s Shake, Rattle, and Rock video series which streams free of charge directly into the hospital rooms and care facilities for pediatric patients and their families to enjoy. In 2022 Jimmie was proudly involved in recording a record from which the proceeds will benefit the Dick Wagner “Remember the Child Fund”. The album called ‘ROCKSPELL’ was produced by iconic producer Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, John Lennon, Patti Smith, New York Dolls) and features Jimmie Bones on keyboards as well as string and horn arrangements along with Garret Bielaniec (Alice Cooper ‘Detroit Stories’) on guitar, Johnny Bee Badanjek (Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, The Rockets, Edgar Winter, Alice Cooper) on drums, and Paul Randolph (Alice Cooper ‘Detroit Stories’, Mark Farner) on bass backing the acclaimed Detroit Youth Choir. Jack Douglas and co-producer Susan Michelson wished to create a joyous fusion of Rock n Roll, RnB, and Gospel music. The Detroit Youth Choir which won 2nd place on season 14 of ‘America's Got Talent’ and more recently Golden Buzzer Winners on ‘America’s Got Talent All Stars 2023’ bring the youthful spirit of Metro Detroit to classic hits. ROCKSPELL was considered for six Grammy nominations and was nominated for ‘Outstanding National Recording’ in the 2023 Detroit Music Awards. ROCKSPELL has since won Youth Project Of The Year in the 2023 Stellar Gospel Music Awards."
