        "text": "Richard Paul Randolph lived a vibrant life filled with love, dedication, and passion. Born on March 9, 1963, in Johnson City, TN, Richard's journey came to a peaceful close and he met his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on June 28, 2024. He will be dearly missed by his mother, Carolyn Camper Randolph; sister Lois (Chuck) Shivers; brother Chuck (Louella) Randolph; fianc√©e Michelle Torres; Michelle's children, Alana (Josh) Sliva, Felicia Watson, Brian Watson and Bekkah Nelson; nieces and nephews, Cody Shivers, Matt Johnson, and Kristi (Colleen) Shivers; as well as his ten cherished grandchildren.\n\nRichard was preceded in death by his father, Clarence Gilbert Randolph.\n\nHe dedicated 32 years of his life to the Johnson City Power Board before his well-deserved retirement. Currently, in his part-time role at Pal's, Richard continued to spread his bright smile and warm spirit wherever he went.\n\nHis love for fishing, the great outdoors, and unwavering support for the Pittsburgh Penguins was infectious. Through his faith and membership in the North Johnson City Baptist Church, Richard found solace and purpose in his commitment to Bible study. His zest for life and unwavering dedication in all facets of life left an indelible mark on those who had the pleasure of knowing him.\n\nIn celebration of his extraordinary life, a visitation will be held from 4 PM until 7 PM on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, at Morris-Baker Funeral Home. His family, friends, and community members are invited to gather together to celebrate the incredible journey of a man who touched so many hearts. Although Richard never said goodbye, the memories of his kind words and warm presence will echo in our hearts forever. Until we meet again, \"see ya,\" Richard, from your loving family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to North Johnson City Baptist Church, 305 Ferndale Rd., Johnson City, TN 37604.\n\nMemories and condolences may be shared with the family via www.morrisbaker.com. Morris-Baker Funeral Home & Cremation Services, 2001 E. Oakland Ave., Johnson City, is serving the Randolph family. (423)282-1521"
