        "meta_description": "\"Here are the long-awaited 'Restless Soul' remixes of one of the biggest soulful tunes released early 2006 by Still Music. Isoul8 & Paul Randolph's 'On My Heart' did the rounds this year with amazing support from Ame, Jazzanova, Bugz In The Attic, Charles Webster, Alex From Tokyo, Needs, Llorca, Ralf Gum, Fabrice Lig and many others. On A1, Phil Asher goes straight for the Restless Soul sound that made his productions so famous and lasting over the years. His take on the vocal mix is superb and works perfectly on the dancefloor thanks to the deep bassline and straight up beats. On B1, Phil spices up things a little with a pure dub that brings us back to the heydays of the Chicago house scene. A bit acidy and a bit deep, this one is a killer. Isoul8 gets back to work on B2 and delivers a new dub version of his original dub. 'Dub My Dub' is also a tribute to the Chicago/Detroit deep tech house sound with an instrumental mix that reminds us of Larry Heard. Innervision fans should be delighted by this mix.\"",
