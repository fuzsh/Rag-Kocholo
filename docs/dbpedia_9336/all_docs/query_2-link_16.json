Heavy - Ashley Beedle&#39;s &#39;North Street&#39; &#39;Stripped Back&#39; Space Remix\n3. Heavy - Ashley Beedle&#39;s &#39;North Street&#39; Space Instrumental\n4. Heavy - Ashley Beedle&#39;s &#39;North Street&#39; Bass Goodness Vocal\n5. Heavy - Ashley Beedle&#39;s &#39;North Street&#39; Bass Goodness Instrumental\n\nRamrock Blue Records are incredibly proud to welcome Paul Randolph to the label with his outstanding track ‘Heavy’. Already released in its original version, Ashley Beedle + the North Street crew, Darren Morris &amp; Jo Wallace put another couple of rotations on the composition. There’s a Sun Ra meets Ronnie Foster vibe going on in the ‘Space’ remixes and a nod towards Mr White in the ‘Bass Goodness’ versions. Whatever your soulful leaning, there should be a remix there that covers your bases. Paul explains the inspiration behind ‘Heavy’:\r\n“The instrumental track composed by Vernon D. Hill was presented to me shortly after the transition of Gil Scott Heron.  Ironically, earlier that year I had the pleasure of seeing him perform in Berlin. Moved by this experience, I researched Mr. Heron’s life, short stories, and poems which later influenced the lyrics to Heavy”.\r\n\r\nMulti-talented Detroit Artist Paul Randolph, aka “Randolph”, comes from a musical family. As a result, he began honing his musical skills at a very young age. Born in Philadelphia, PA he and his family relocated to Sao Paulo, Brazil when he was six years old. &quot;My first exposure to music was, primarily, from my Dad. He played jazz trombone in high school and college. He, my mother, and paternal grandparents exposed me to a wide range of musical genres. Ultimately, this all had a major impact on my decision to make music my career”.\r\n\r\nSettling in Detroit during his early teen years, he graduated from Central Michigan University with a degree in Marketing - continuing to perform music while working at a variety of other jobs. Randolph eventually put all of his focus into his music. A versatile musician who plays guitar as well as percussion, the bass is the instrument that Randolph “fell in love with&quot;. \r\n\r\nRandolph has performed with such greats as Fela drummer Tony Allen, Odetta, Dennis Coffey and Johnny Johnson, to name a few. He was lead vocalist and bassist for the Detroit-based New Orleans-style funk and blues band Mudpuppy. After his stint with Mudpuppy, he went on to perform and record with Amp Fiddler, Carl Craig, iSoul8, As One, Catz n Dogz, Makoto, Tettory Bad, Zed Bias, and currently, the Berlin-based, Jazzanova Live. Randolph&#39;s music has been categorized into many different genres, pop, rock, neo soul, jazz, funk, blues, and electronic. His first solo CD, &quot;This Is What It Is&quot; was released on Kenny Dixon, Jr.&#39;s Mahogani Music imprint in 2004. His second solo project, &quot;Lonely Eden&quot; was released in 2007 and featured collaborations with notables, Stephanie McKay (&quot;Broken&quot;) and Waajeed of the Platinum Pied Pipers (title track &quot;Lonely Eden&quot;). His commercial work has included, most notably, MGM Casino, McDonald’s and Corona Beer. \r\n\r\nAlthough a bit secretive about his latest projects, Randolph has had releases between 2012 and 2016 which include, “Chips n Chitlins” with legendary dub step producer Zed Bias of Manchester, UK; Kiko Navarro, “Captain of Her Heart”; Jazzanova ,“Funkhaus Sessions”; Isoul8, “Stay Stay Stay” and ”Waves of Love”; DJ Kawasaki “Where Would We Be”; Boddhi Satva “Soldier”; and Mikael Delta “This Is The Place”. Randolph 2017 releases include a collaboration he both wrote and produced for Kathy Kosins and her executive producer Kamau Kenyatta for Membran Records “Could You Be Me”. \r\n\r\nUpcoming releases in 2018 include - “Heavy” the single with remixes by Ashley Beedle, Jazzanova - “It’s Beautiful”, Hubert Laws, Alex Attias, and more. In 2018 Randolph will launch his new label Sun Temple Records. He is currently touring with the Jazzanova “Live Band” and is featured on their new album “The Pool”. \r\n\r\nFollow here:\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.randolph.357\r\nTwitter: @RandolphPaul\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/paulrandolph/",
