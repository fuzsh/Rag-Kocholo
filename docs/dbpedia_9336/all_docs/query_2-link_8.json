On the surface we know that Randolph was born in Gainesville, Georgia. He went to Tennessee-Martin to school where he played linebacker and played well enough to catch on in the Canadian Football League. He played nine years in the CFL, the first seven with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, where he was also a team captain."
