        "text": "A neuropsychological assessment allows for the development of a cognitive profile of an individual’s strengths and weaknesses. The integrity of the underlying brain structures associated with these strengths and weaknesses is determined by systematically evaluating cognitive, emotional, and psychological functions.\n\nNeuropsychological assessments can assist in the development of interventions to improve and maximize daily functioning at work, in school, or in home and community functions. A neuropsychological assessment provides information that can help an individual function at their optimal level in all aspects of life.\n\nOccasionally, it is necessary to complete the evaluation over two or more sessions. In general, the clinician attempts to elicit the patient's best possible performance under optimal conditions. Sessions range between 1 to 3 hours depending on the complexity of the issues to be addressed by the evaluation and the patient's condition (for example, fatigue, confusion, and motor slowing can extend the time required for an evaluation).\n\nDr. Campbell is a licensed Clinical Psychologist and a Board-Certified Neuropsychologist specializing in child, adolescent, and adult neuropsychological evaluations in Southern California.
