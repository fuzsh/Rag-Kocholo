        "text": "The arts are an integral part of an abundant life, and we ensure that opportunities are available to every student for their artistic growth and development.\n\nWhy Study Performing Arts at Randolph?\n\nStudents from all majors and academic programs are welcome to enroll in performing arts coursework and participate in productions and performances. Whether experiencing the joy and power of movement in a dance class, singing in Chorale or playing an instrument in Chamber Orchestra, or being part of a theatre show onstage or backstage, every student gains valuable experience, understanding, and appreciation of the performing arts during their time at Randolph.\n\nDance\n\nThe dance program offers courses in ballet, jazz, contemporary, and musical theatre dance technique which are open to all students. These classes expose students to the joy and power of movement, as well as the discipline of dance. Students develop both physical and spatial awareness and increased flexibility and coordination. Dance history courses give students the opportunity to connect dance to its societal context. Additional course offerings include Pilates, dance composition, and repertory.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music program fosters an understanding of music as both a form of artistic expression and a language. Course offerings in the department acknowledge this and provide the opportunity to pursue music’s three interrelated areas: its theory, history, and performance. Students may pursue performance study through individual lessons or in a group setting by joining the Chorale or the Chamber Orchestra. In theory classes, students will develop their understanding of the construction and use of the musical language. Music history courses examine the cultural and sociological role of the art form.\n\nTheatre\n\nThe theatre program is directed toward developing an understanding and appreciation of the interrelationship of actor, script, performing space, and audience. The department’s curriculum centers on courses that explore performance (acting and directing), text (literature and playwriting), and performing space (design and technology), and that recognize—in various considerations of styles, periods, history, standards, and conventions—the essentiality of the audience in completing the theatre circle. Theatre majors are guided through the academic and production programs to hone their specialty area of emphasis while cultivating a generalist approach to theatre. The program is dedicated to exposing each student to the breadth of theatrical expression in their time on campus, emphasizing the best of period and contemporary work and the variety of production styles, while providing an individually crafted program of study and set of experiences that maximizes artistic growth. The department offers a major in theatre (both B.A. and B.F.A. options, with tracks of specialization) and minors in dance, music, theatre, technical theatre, and musical theatre, as well as a low-residency M.F.A. in theatre.\n\nDegrees offered\n\nBachelor of Arts Degree in Theatre\n\nBachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Acting\n\nBachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Design and Technology\n\nBachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Directing\n\nMaster of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Acting\n\nMaster of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Directing\n\nMaster of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre: Design and Technology\n\nMinor in Dance\n\nMinor in Music\n\nMinor in Music – Voice\n\nMinor in Musical Theatre\n\nMinor in Theatre\n\nMinor in Technical Theatre\n\nRelated Programs\n\nArt\n\nArt History\n\nClassics\n\nEnglish\n\nMedia and Culture Studies\n\nSport and Exercise Studies\n\nThe Randolph Experience\n\nProductions\n\nOur interdisciplinary performances include a Performing Arts Showcase in the fall and a Cabaret in the spring, with dance, music, and theatre all represented onstage.\n\nThe Fall Showcase, Candlelight Concert, Winter Showcase, and Spring Concert include ensemble performances of both dance and music students. Chorale and Chamber Orchestra are often featured together in these concerts.\n\nThe theatre program presents two to three productions per year, including at least one on the Thoresen mainstage and one in the Lab Theatre. Capstone projects for senior theatre majors provide those students with an opportunity to research and produce a work of their choosing.\n\nRandolph theatre students are exposed to a wide breadth of theatrical expression, emphasizing the best of period and contemporary work and the variety of production styles.\n\nThrough coursework and production experiences, majors hone their specialty area of emphasis while cultivating generalist approach which recognizes the interrelationship of actor, script, performing space, and audience.\n\nAreas of emphasis include acting, directing, design and technology.\n\nFaculty mentors work with students to build an individually crafted program of study and set of experiences that maximizes artistic growth and opportunities after graduation.\n\nSmall Classes\n\nRandolph classes are full of engagement and interaction.

Buck (Class of 1914).\n\nChamber Orchestra\n\nChamber Orchestra provides a rare opportunity for students to gain valuable experience performing side by side with local professional musicians.\n\nLarger works performed by the ensemble include Stravinsky Pulcinella Suite, and Beethoven symphonies No. 1, 6, and 8; with choir, Mozart Requiem, and Gonzalez Misa Azteca.\n\nThe Greek Play\n\nUnique among colleges and universities in the United States, our tradition of the Greek Play goes back to 1909. Every other year, students perform an authentic Greek drama. The production adheres to the original conventions that governed theatre in the time of the great tragedians, believing that the best plays will emerge from the conditions for which they were written.\n\nThe College boasts the Mabel K. Whiteside Greek Theatre, a classic outdoor Greek theatre also affectionately known by students as The Dell. This unique facility allows the plays to be performed in daylight for an audience seated in a semi-circle around the performers.\n\nLearn more about the Greek Play.\n\nEndstation Theatre Company\n\nAs Randolph’s professional theatre company in residence, Endstation Theatre Company uses the campus as the home base for its summer program.\n\nFounded in 2007, Endstation is known for producing new works, reinterpretations of classical plays, and other works chosen specifically for the Central Virginia community based on the historical, current, and cultural events of the area.\n\nProductions are performed in the College’s Thoresen Theatre as well as other campus venues such as the Mabel K. Whiteside Greek Theatre (aka The Dell) and Michels Plaza as well off-campus sites like Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest, the Academy Center for the Arts and the Old City Cemetery.\n\nEndstation also hosts the Embark! Youth Theatre Conservatory, a 2-week summer program held at Randolph which gives rising 3rd through graduating 12th graders the opportunity to hone their skills under the direction of theatre professionals from around the region and nation.\n\nRandolph College students enjoy apprenticeship opportunities, workshops, and access to Endstation’s specialized designers, technicians, and artists.\n\nMore information: www.endstationtheatre.org\n\nSock and Buskin\n\nSock and Buskin, the student drama club, supports the theatre productions and promotes drama as an essential part of life at the College.\n\nOutcomes\n\nHistoric Preservation Law\n\nJanie Campbell ’12, history major\n\nPreservation Consultant, law firm of Rogers Lewis Jackson Mann & Quinn, LLC, Columbia, South Carolina\n\nJanie’s group works with developers seeking tax credits for rehabilitating historic properties.\n\n“I work closely with project architects to ensure that historic, character defining elements of each building are preserved and restored, which can vary tremendously as what is significant to a 1929 airplane hangar is vastly different from what makes a 1963 mid-century modern motel unique!”\n\nShe writes National Register of Historic Places nominations and Historic Preservation Certification applications, which detail the property’s significance. She also conducts site visits to ensure work is being completed as described and photographs the before, during, and after conditions of each project.\n\n“Randolph certainly laid the foundation for my research and writing skills. The Summer Research Program, in particular, prepared me for the type of place-based research I do now. “\n\nOpportunities\n\nTop Ranked Professors\n\nRandolph College’s faculty are consistently recognized as among the best in the nation.
