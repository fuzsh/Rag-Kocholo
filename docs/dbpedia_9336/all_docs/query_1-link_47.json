In addition to currently working as lead vocalist for popular electro act \"Jazzanova Live\" worldwide, Randolph has performed and recorded with many musical luminaries- including Tony Allen, Odetta, Carl Craig, Zed Bias and DJ Kawasaki. For this special event in ZigZag Club, Randolph brings his band of young Black American musicians (including Marlon Browden on drums and Charles Sammons on auxiliary Acoustic/ electric basses) to team up with fellow Detroit native, the award winning pianist Kelvin Sholar, to present an exciting repertoire spanning from cutting edge Rock and Soul originals to classics by Nat Cole, the Peddlers and Jimi Hendrix.\"\n\nhttp://www.jazzanova.com\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/randolph/\n\nhttp://kelvinsholar.com/"
