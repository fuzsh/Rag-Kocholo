        "text": "STILLWATER – Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy announced today the addition of Paul Randolph as the new defensive line coach for Cowboy football.\n\nRandolph comes to Stillwater after most recently serving as the defensive line coach at Indiana for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. He has 26 years of collegiate coaching experience, with 23 years spent coaching the defensive line. He has spent 14 seasons at the Power Five level and has coached in 17 bowl games during his career.\n\nPrior to his time at IU, Randolph spent three seasons as the defensive line coach at Texas Tech and coached four players to All-Big 12 honors in his stint with the Red Raiders.\n\nBefore arriving in Lubbock, Randolph coach at Memphis, Arizona State, Pittsburgh, Tulsa, Rice, Alabama, West Virginia, Toledo, Illinois State, Valdosta State and UT-Martin. More than half of his career has been spent as a defensive line coach, but he also has experience as an associate head coach, a defensive coordinator and an associate athletic director.\n\nIn addition to his work on the defensive line, Randolph has also coached linebackers and special teams.\n\nSome highlights from his résumé include coaching five defensive linemen to All-Pac 12 recognition in four years at Arizona State while also leading ASU to an FBS-leading 9.0 tackles for loss per game in 2012, and helping Pittsburgh rank third in the nation with 3.31 sacks per game in 2011.\n\nAt Tulsa, he served as executive senior associate head coach and co-defensive coordinator while he oversaw a defense that led the country in interceptions and finished third in takeaways in 2010.\n\nWhile he coached defensive ends at Alabama from 2003-05, the Crimson Tide boasted one of the nation's top defenses and led the country in scoring defense during his final season while also finishing second in total defense. He was named one of the nation's top-25 recruiters by Rivals during his time at Alabama.\n\nRandolph started his career as the linebackers coach at his alma mater, UT-Martin, in 1998. An all-conference linebacker, Randolph earned his degree in electrical engineering technology in 1990. He played 10 seasons in the Canadian Football League with stops at Winnipeg (1988-95) and Montreal (1996-97). He served two years as a team captain and player-coach in Montreal and won the Grey Cup championships in 1988 and 1990 with Winnipeg. He was inducted into the Blue Bombers Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nRandolph replaces Greg Richmond as the defensive line coach at Oklahoma State."
