        "text": "Paul Randolph, who has more than 20 years of collegiate coaching experience with stops at the likes of Alabama, Arizona State and West Virginia, enters his third season as Texas Tech’s defensive line coach.\n\nRandolph was one of head coach Matt Wells’ first hires to his charter staff at Texas Tech, reuniting him with defensive coordinator Keith Patterson after the two previously worked together at Arizona State (2014-15), Pittsburgh (2011) and Tulsa (2007-10).\n\nOver his two seasons, Randolph has provided a strong presence for a defensive line that featured a pair of veterans in Eli Howard and Broderick Washington Jr. as well as a slew of newcomers in Tony Bradford Jr., Jaylon Hutchings and Tyree Wilson that have become staples up front. Texas Tech has steadily improved in the trenches under Randolph as the Red Raiders ranked 31st nationally in tackles for loss in only his first season.\n\nAdditionally, both Howard and Washington received NFL opportunities following their Texas Tech career as Howard signed an undrafted free agent agreement with the Atlanta Falcons in 2021, while Washington was a fifth round selection by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2020 NFL Draft. Washington post one of his best seasons as a Red Raider under Randolph’s guidance in 2019, eventually earning All-Big 12 honorable mention accolades as well as invites to both the NFLPA Collegiate and Reese’s Senior Bowls.\n\nHoward, meanwhile, garnered All-Big 12 second team honors in 2019 after leading the Red Raiders with a team-high 5.0 sacks, all of which that came during Big 12 play. It marked the first time a Red Raider defensive lineman had earned All-Big 12 first or second team honors since current NFL standout Kerry Hyder also collected second-team accolades in 2013. Howard, who battled injuries during his senior campaign in 2020, closed his career ranked in the top 10 all-time in school history for career sacks.\n\nRandolph arrived in Lubbock following three seasons in a similar role at the University of Memphis where the Tigers notched 26 wins and played in three bowl games during his tenure. The Tigers claimed The American West Division title each of his final two years en route to playing in both the AutoZone Liberty Bowl and the Birmingham Bowl.\n\nThe Tigers developed into one of the country’s most opportunistic defenses during Randolph’s tenure as Memphis forced 81 turnovers during that span, which ranked fourth among teams nationally. Memphis was among the nation’s elite defenses for takeaways in each of his first two seasons, finishing tied for fifth with 29 turnovers in 2016 and tied for third in 2017 with 31. Of the 60 combined takeaways those two seasons, 28 were fumble recoveries, which ranked in the top five among FBS programs during that span.\n\nPrior to joining the Memphis staff, Randolph spent a total of four seasons at Arizona State from 2012-15, three as the associate head coach, co-defensive coordinator and defensive line coach and the final year as the Associate Athletics Director for Championship Life. Arizona State posted a 28-12 overall record and 19-8 Pac-12 Conference mark during his first three seasons on staff, all of which resulted in bowl trips. The Sun Devils boasted a pair of 10-win seasons over the 2013-14 campaigns, which featured a 14-4 record during Pac-12 play alone.\n\nRandolph mentored five defensive linemen into All-Pac 12 honors during his tenure, namely Will Sutton, who was a 2012 consensus All-America selection and a two-time Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year recipient. Sutton was Arizona State’s first consensus All-American since 2007 and became only the third defensive lineman in Pac-12 history to be named the Defensive Player of the Year in consecutive years since the league began awarding the accolade in 1980. Four of Randolph’s five All-Pac 12 performers were either drafted or signed NFL free agent contracts.\n\nOver his three seasons, Arizona State featured one of the nation’s most disruptive defenses as the Sun Devils led the FBS in tackles for a loss (9.0 per game) and ranked second in sacks (4.0 per game) in 2012. Arizona State ranked in the top 20 for both categories in each of the next two seasons as well.\n\nArizona State marked Randolph’s fourth stop with then-Sun Devils head coach Todd Graham as he previously helped rebuild programs at Rice (2006), Tulsa (2007-10) and Pittsburgh (2011). Randolph oversaw linebackers at Rice before moving back to the defensive line in both stints at Tulsa and Pittsburgh.\n\nHis defensive line at Pittsburgh transformed into one of the nation’s elite units in only a season as the Panthers ranked third nationally with 3.31 sacks per game. Pittsburgh ended that season with an appearance in the BBVA Compass Bowl.\n\nDuring his four seasons at Tulsa, Randolph played an instrumental role in transforming the Golden Hurricanes into a perennial bowl team. Tulsa won 36 games during that time, including three bowl victories. Randolph helped mold a defense that led the country in interceptions and ranked third in forced turnovers during his final season in 2010.\n\nIn his lone season at Rice, meanwhile, Randolph was part of a staff that helped produce one of the most impressive turnarounds in recent college football history. The Owls closed the 2006 regular season with victories in six of their final seven games to earn their first bowl berth in 45 years.\n\nRandolph made his way to Rice following three years as the defensive ends coach at Alabama (2003-05) where he helped the Crimson Tide boast one of the nation’s top defenses. Alabama led the country in scoring defense (10.7 points per game) during his final season, while also ranking second in total defense (255.1 yards per game), fifth in passing defense (160.8 yards per game) and ninth in rushing defense (94.3 yards per game). Additionally, Randolph was recognized for his work on the recruiting trail as he was named one of the nation’s top-25 recruiters by Rivals.\n\nRandolph began his coaching career as the linebackers coach at his alma mater, Tennessee-Martin, in 1998. He moved from there to positions at Valdosta State (1999), Illinois State (2000), Toledo (2001) and West Virginia (2002), the final three of which he oversaw special teams in addition to the defensive line.\n\nRandolph was an all-conference linebacker at UT-Martin where he earned his degree in electrical engineering technology in 1990. He went to play eight seasons in the Canadian Football League with stops at Winnipeg (1988-95) and Montreal (1996-97).\n\nRandolph served two years as a team captain and player-coach while in Montreal after helping lead Winnipeg to the Grey Cup championships in 1998 and 1990. He was inducted into the Blue Bombers’ Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nPAUL RANDOLPH COACHING EXPERIENCE\n\n2019-Present – Texas Tech Assistant Coach (Defensive Line)\n\n2016-18 – Memphis Assistant Coach (Defensive Line)\n\n2015 – Arizona State Associate A.D. for Championship Life\n\n2012-14 – Arizona State Associate Head Coach/Co-Defensive Coordinator (Defensive Line)\n\n2011 – Pittsburgh Executive Associate Head Coach/Co-Defensive Coordinator (Defensive Line)\n\n2007-10 – Tulsa Executive Senior Associate H.C./Co-Defensive Coordinator (Defensive Line)\n\n2006 – Rice Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Coordinator (Linebackers)\n\n2003-05 – Alabama Assistant Coach (Defensive Ends)\n\n2002 – West Virginia Assistant Coach (Defensive Line/Special Teams)\n\n2001 – Toledo Assistant Coach (Defensive Line/Special Teams)\n\n2000 – Illinois State Assistant Coach (Defensive Line/Special Teams)\n\n1999 – Valdosta State Assistant Coach (Defensive Line)\n\n1998 – UT Martin Assistant Coach (Linebackers)"
