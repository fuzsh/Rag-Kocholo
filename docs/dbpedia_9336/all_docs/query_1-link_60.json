        "text": "ROBERT RANDOLPH BAND\n\nWhat do Beyonce, classic rock heavyweights Elton John, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, singer-songwriters Dave Matthews, John Mayer, Leanne Rhymes, Darius Rucker, and some of the biggest arena rock acts like Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica all have in common? At some point in their career they wanted to incorporate the singing sound of the pedal steel guitar, and they all called in the same person to do it: Robert Randolph.\n\nA virtuoso on the pedal steel guitar, Robert Randolph burst onto the music scene with his fiery, passionate instrumental work and heartfelt music. Robert’s innovative approach to the pedal steel guitar has earned him four Grammy nominations, NPR has described the band as one with an “irresistible rock ‘n’ roll swagger.” Rolling Stone included Randolph upon their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nQUINN DEVEAUX\n\nDrawing from his roots in the church choir, Indiana-born Quinn DeVeaux is the originator of blue beat soul, a rapturous blend of early blues, old-school country and soul. His songwriting is at times uplifting, rapturous and healing with a focus on modern storytelling. Channeling artists such as Sam Cooke, Bill Withers, Otis Redding, Ray Charles, and Leon Bridges, Quinn weaves a rich tapestry of sound that evokes and pays homage to his forebears all while keeping his finger on the pulse with his contemporaries.\n\n“For fun I would change the lyrics to songs as a kid. Ultimately, I wanted the songs to reflect more clearly the world I was in.” His new album, Leisure, is out now and available for your listening ears."
