        "text": "Homer Louis \"Boots\" Randolph III (June 3, 1927[1] – July 3, 2007) was an American musician best known for his 1963 saxophone hit \"Yakety Sax\" (which became Benny Hill's signature tune). Randolph was a major part of the \"Nashville sound\" for most of his professional career.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nRandolph was born in Paducah, Kentucky, United States,[1] and raised in Cadiz, Kentucky, attending high school in Evansville, Indiana.[2]\n\nAs a child, he learned to play music with his family's band. He was not sure where or why he acquired the nickname \"Boots\", although it may have served to avoid confusion since his father and he had the same first name. He started out playing the ukulele and trombone, but switched to tenor saxophone when his father unexpectedly brought one home.[3]\n\nAt the end of World War II, Boots Randolph played saxophone, trombone, and vibraphone in the United States Army Band. After his service in the Army, he played with Dink Welch's Kopy Kats in Decatur, Illinois, from 1948 to 1954. He briefly resided in Louisville, Kentucky, before returning to Decatur to start his own group. He left Decatur in 1957.[4]\n\nDuring his forty-plus year career, Randolph performed in hundreds of venues alongside many artists in pop, rock, jazz, and country music. He played on many recording sessions with Elvis Presley and also performed on soundtracks for a number of Presley's motion pictures, one popular song being \"Return to Sender\".[1]\n\nRandolph recorded for Monument Records in Nashville and played on Roy Orbison's 1963 hit, \"Mean Woman Blues.\"[4] He was also featured on \"Little Queenie\" by REO Speedwagon, \"Java\" by Al Hirt, \"Turn On Your Love Light\" by Jerry Lee Lewis, and \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" by Brenda Lee. He was present on many recordings by guitarist Chet Atkins with whom he often performed. Early in his career, he often billed himself as Randy Randolph.\n\nAs a solo recording artist, Randolph placed four singles in the Top-100 between 1963 and 1967. The most successful of these was \"Yakety Sax\", which reached #35 in 1963 and stayed on the charts for nine weeks.[5] Randolph was also successful on Billboard Magazine's album charts, having fourteen entries between 1963 and 1972. Boots With Strings from 1966 reached #36 and stayed on the chart for nearly two years.[6]\n\nIn 1977, Randolph opened a successful club of his own in Nashville's Printer's Alley.[7] He also frequently appeared on the television program Hee Haw, and was a member of the Million Dollar Band.\n\nOn July 3, 2007, Randolph died at Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, after suffering a brain hemorrhage.[4] He had celebrated his 80th birthday just one month prior. He had a son, a daughter and four grandchildren.[3]\n\nHis final solo studio album, A Whole New Ballgame, was released June 12, 2007.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\nYear Title Chart positions US 1960 \"Boots Randolph's Yakety Sax\" 79 1963 \"Yakety Sax!\" — 1964 \"Hip Boots!\" — 1965 \"Boots Randolph plays More Yakety Sax!\" 118 \"Plays 12 Monstrous Sax Hits!\" — 1966 \"Boots with Strings\"A 36 \"The Fantastic Boots Randolph\" — 1967 \"Boots Randolph with the Knightsbridge Strings & Voices\" 189 \"King Of Yakety\" — 1968 \"Sunday Sax\" 76 \"The Sound of Boots\" 60 1969 \"...with love/The Seductive Sax of Boots Randolph\" 82 \"Boots And Stockings\" 16 \"Yakety Revisited\" 113 1970 \"Hit Boots 1970 \" 157 Boots with Brass 168 1971 \"Homer Louis Randolph, III\" 141 1972 \"Boots Randolph Plays the Hits of Today\" 192 1973 \"Sentimental Journey\" — 1974 \"Country Boots\"B — 1975 \"Cool Boots\" — 1976 \"Party Boots\" — 1977 \"Sax Appeal\" — 1978 \"Boots Randolph Puts a Little Sax in Your Life\" — 1982 \"Dedication\" — 1983 \"Yakety-Madness\" (featuring Richie Cole (musician)) — 1990 \"Boots\" — 1992 \"Boots Live\" — \"Christmas At Boots' Place\" (featuring Tommy Newsom's Jazztet) — 2000 \"Songs For The Spirit\" — 2002 \"A Christmas Holiday\" — 2007 \"A Whole New Ballgame\" —\n\nA \"Boots with Strings\" also peaked at #3 on Jazz albums and #21 on R&B albums.\n\nB \"Country Boots\" peaked at #30 on Country albums\n\nSingles[]\n\nYear Title Chart positions US US AC 1963 \"Yakety Sax\" 35 — 1964 \"Hey, Mr. Sax Man\" 77 — 1966 \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" 93 28 \"Miss You\" \"Yodelin' Sax\" 1967 \"Temptation\" 93 30 \"Big Daddy\" 105 — 1968 \"Fred\" — 39 \"Gentle on My Mind\" — 19 1969 \"Hey Jude\" \"Down Yonder\" 1970 \"Anna\" 111 40 \"Those Were The Days\" \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\"\n\nSee also[]\n\nThe Nashville A-Team\n\nReferences[]\n\nTrott, Walt.
