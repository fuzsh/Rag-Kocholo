        "text": "The Blue Moon Boys\n\nThe Blue Moon Boys consisted of Scotty Moore (guitar), Bill Black (bass) later adding D.J. Fontana (drums).\n\nBill Black and Scotty Moore had a band in Memphis, TN called The Starlight Wranglers. Scotty Moore befriended Sun Records founder and Producer, Sam Phillips and would regularly visit him at Sun Studio hoping someday to find success in the music business. On one of these visits to Sun, Sam Phillips made the statement \"I need to find a white kid that can sing R&B. Sam's secretary, Marion Keisker, spoke up and said \"what about the kid with the side burns who recorded a song with for mother the other day?\". Sam asked her if she still had his phone number. She responded \"yes\" at which time Sam said \"give it to Scotty\". He told Scotty to call him and tell him that he was a talent scout for Sun Records and would Elvis like to audition?\n\nElvis came to Scotty's apartment and met Scotty and Bill Black which led to a demo session at Sun Studios. During that demo session, they recorded \"That's Alright Momma\". That was the beginning of Elvis Presley and rock and roll as we know it.\n\nThe Tennessee Two\n\nThe Tennessee Two consisted of bass guitarist Marshall Grant and lead guitarist Luther Perkins. Both were mechanics in Memphis, TN at the local Plymouth dealership where their mutual love of music led them to pursue playing guitar together. The mechanic who worked next to Marshall Grant was Roy Cash. Roy asked one day if his brother could join them when he moved to Memphis. His brother was Johnny Cash. They met on the floor of the garage where they all worked when Johnny arrived in Memphis by bus. That meeting was the beginning of music history.\n\nMarshall learned how to play bass guitar. Luther learned how to play electric lead guitar and Johnny played rhythm and sang.\n\nAfter their first successful recordings, they added W.S. Holland and changed their name to Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three.\n\nInductees : Marshall Grant, Luther Perkins\n\nThe Wrecking Crew\n\nThe Wrecking Crew was the name given to a group of LA musicians who dominated the top 40 pop charts in the 60's and 70's playing behind artists such as The Beach Boys, The Mamas and The Papas, The Byrds, Sonny and Cher, The Grass Roots, The Fifth Dimension, America, Elvis, Simon & Garfunkel, Johnny Rivers and The Carpenters.\n\nAccording to record producer, Lou Adler, the beginnging core members for his recordings were Hal Blaine, Larry Knechtel, and Joe Osborn. Other members came and went spanning every instrument you can imagine. Some even became famous on their own, such as Glen Campbell.\n\nMany of what became known as The Wrecking Crew started out as Phil Spectors Wall of Sound session musicians.\n\nInductees : Glen Campbell, Tommy Tedesco, Billy Strange, Leon Russell, Don Randi, Larry Knechtel, Carol Kaye, Joe Osborn, Ray Pohlman, Hal Blaine, Earl Palmer, Julius Wechter, Lyle Ritz, James Burton, Jim Horn, Mike Deasy, Al DeLory, Plas Johnson, Don Peake, Louie Shelton\n\nAl Kooper\n\nAl Kooper started out playing guitar in the early 1950's & 60's in New York. Most notably, he played with the band The Teenagers who had the hit song \"Short Shorts\". Al Kooper also pursued playing keyboards but was persuaded by his teacher to focus on the guitar.\n\nAl obtained studio session work as a guitarist, not because of how great he was, but, according to Al, he was able to play the simple rock guitar riffs that the other educated musicians couldn't dummy down enough to play.\n\nAl developed a friendship with famed New York record producer Tom Wilson who produced, among others, Bob Dylan. Knowing that Al was a Dylan fan, Tom invited him to one of Bob's recording sessions which historically led to Al sneaking into the studio while Tom was on the telephone and sitting down at the Hammond B-3 organ hoping to be able to play on his hero's session. Even though Tom did not consider Al a keyboard player, he allowed him to stay and play on the song. The song turned out to be \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and Al's Hammond organ part became legendary, thrusting him full steam to the top of the music industry.\n\nBilly Sherrill\n\nBilly Sherrill was born the son of a baptist preacher in north Alabama and started playing piano at his father's tent revivals as a young boy. This led to Billy later playing saxophone and keyboards in a local rock and roll band called The Fairlanes with another local musician playing bass named Rick Hall. This led to Rick and Billy starting a recording studio in Florence, Alabama which Billy named FAME Studios (Florence Alabama Music Enterprises).\n\nAfter receiving a large royalty check for a song he had written from a publisher friend in Nashville, Billy decided to leave FAME Studio's and move to Nashville to become a songwriter.\n\nBilly taught himself to play virtually every instrument in a band like the guitar, bass, keyboards, drum and saxophone.\n\nBilly secured a job as a recording engineer at the newly opened, Nashville Sun Studios and worked for founder and producer, the legendary Sam Phillips. Sam discovered Elvis, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Ike Turner and others. Sam allowed Billy to record his own records, which he performed every instrument on, after hours at Sam's, Nashville studio.\n\nBilly had regional success with some of his records which led to him being hired to run the newly opened EPIC Records, a subsidiary of CBS in Nashville.\n\nBilly soon became the President of the CBS/EPIC Records Nashville office.\n\nBilly signed and produced artists such as Tammy Wynette, David Houston, Barbara Mandrell, Johnny Paycheck, Marty Robbins, Bobby Vinton, Charlie Rich, Elvis Costello and the great George Jones for whom Billy produced what was voted the number one country song of all time, \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\". Billy also wrote and produced \"Stand by Your Man\" for Tammy Wynnete, which had been the previous number one country record of all time.\n\nBilly was voted songwriter of the century by BMI(Broadcast Music Incorporated).\n\nPaul Riser - Arranger Award\n\nPaul’s amazing career as an arranger started with work as a session trombonist at Motown, but it wasn’t long before he became one of the top arrangers in the history of American popular music. As it is with so many talented people behind the scenes, you may not recognize his name, but you will certainly remember his work arranging such songs as “Papa Was A Rollin’ Stone,” “My Cherie Amour,” “I Believe I Can Fly,”, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” “Two Hearts,” “If I Were Your Woman,” “My Girl,” “Tears of A Clown,” “I Heard It Through The Grapevine” and “Never Too Much”.\n\nPaul co-wrote “What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,” in addition to arranging the recording. In 2009, Paul’s work as an arranger is still in demand. He recently completed a new project with Stevie Wonder.\n\nChet Atkins\n\nAs a guitarist, Chet was inspired by Django Reinhardt, Merle Travis, George Barnes and Les Paul. Chet started out on the ukulele and fiddle and got his first guitar at age 9. As a result of hearing Merle Travis on the radio, Chet soon developed his own style of finger picking that became, unmistakably, Chet’s sound.\n\nChet’s early career had its ups and downs. Believe it or not, Chet was even fired for not sounding country enough. Chet's luck changed when Steve Sholes signed him to RCA Victor. Chet’s first records did not earn enough money for him to support a family, so he joined Mother Maybelle & The Carter Sisters, who were performing on KWTO. Chet moved with Mother Maybelle & The Carter Sisters to Nashville to perform on WSM-AM and the Opry. Chet soon began working on recording sessions as a session leader with Steve Sholes for RCA Victor’s Nashville artists.\n\nChet’s first big record was “Mister Sandman.” Chet was featured on the Eddy Arnold Show in the summer of 1956. In 1957, Sholes put Chet in charge of RCA Records Nashville. Due to the success of Elvis Presley, country sales had dropped dramatically. It was Owen Bradley and Chet who were credited with creating what became known as the Nashville Sound, Making country music more appealing to pop fans. During his career Chet won 14 Grammy’s, 9 CMA Instrumentalist of the Years Awards, The Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and The Billboard Magazine Century Award. Chet was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n“Years from now, after I’m gone, someone will listen to what I’ve done and know I was here. They may not know or care who I was, but they’ll hear my guitars speak for me”.\n\nChet Atkins\n\nBilly Cox\n\nBilly knew greatness the first time he ever heard Jimi Hendrix play guitar. Billy introduced himself to Jimi when they were both in the 101st Airborne, stationed in Fort Campbell, KY. This was the start of a lifelong friendship. After leaving the Army, Billy and Jimi moved to Nashville where they started their band, The King Kasuals and played in Nashville’s Printers Ally and the surrounding “chitlin’ club circuits.” When Hendrix hit the road touring with other bands, Billy opted to stay in Nashville. After Hendrix was discovered by Chas Chandler, bassist from the group The Animals, Jimi asked Billy to go to Europe with him. Billy declined Jimi’s offer because, as he put it, “I only had two strings on my bass and not enough money for a bus ticket.” Hendrix told him he would come back and get him when he made it, and he stayed true to his word.\n\nWhen bassist Noel Redding left The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix brought Billy to Woodstock, NY where they rehearsed with drummer Mitch Mitchell and played the iconic 1969 Woodstock festival. Soon after, Hendrix, Billy and drummer Buddy Miles became The Band of Gypsy’s. After The Band of Gypsy’s, Mitch Mitchell reunited with Billy and Hendrix to rekindle The Jimi Hendrix Experience. After Hendrix passed away, Billy moved back to Nashville where he was hired as a member of the The Charlie Daniels Band. Billy continues touring, writing songs and recording to this day.\n\nCharlie Daniels\n\nCharlie started his career as a session musician in Nashville, working for Producer Bob Johnston. Bob booked Charlie as a session guitarist on three of the four albums Bob Dylan recorded in Nashville. Dylan was so impressed with Charlie’s musicianship that he later included Charlie in recording session with Beatles guitarist George Harrison. In the mid 70’s, Charlie also played fiddle on recordings for The Marshall Tucker Band and Hank Williams Jr. Charlie recorded his first solo album in 1971, but it was his second album in 1973 that yielded his first Top Ten Billboard hit “Uneasy Rider.” Charlie followed that hit with two records in 1975 entitled “The South’s Going To Do it Again” and “Long Haired Country Boy”. In 1979, Charlie had a monster crossover hit with “The Devil Went Down to Georgia,” which won him a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance.\n\nIn the 80’s Charlie continued to have pop airplay with singles like “In America” and “Still in Saigon.” Charlie and the band continue touring the world playing for his fans, including our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2008, Charlie was inducted as a member into the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nVictor Feldman\n\nVictor Feldman was a musical prodigy at age 7. Born in Edgware, Middlesex, England in 1934, Victor came from a very musical family. At age 10, he was featured playing drums in a concert with Glen Miller’s AAF Band. He also became an accomplished player on the vibes, but it was his talent as a pianist for which he was most noted. In 1957, Victor recorded with various jazz artists including Benny Goodman and Cannonball Adderley.\n\nHis most famous contribution was to Miles Davis’s 1963 album “Seven Steps to Heaven” on which Victor wrote the title cut. Victor became an in demand session player in L.A. not only for jazz, but for his work with L.A. session musicians known as “The Wrecking Crew,” who played on most of the southern California pop records in the 60’s and early 70’s. Victor was also known for his work with artists such as Frank Zappa, Joe Walsh and Steely Dan. Victor was only 53 years old when he passed away following an asthma attack in 1987.\n\nToto\n\nToto, consisting of some of LA’s finest studio musicians, has sold over 30 million albums to date. The original line-up consisted of Jeff and Steve Porcaro, David Paich, Steve Lukather and David Hungate. Mike Porcaro took over the position of bass guitarist for David Hungate in 1980. The Porcaro and David Paich brothers came form musical families. The Procaros’ father was session percussionist Joe Porcaro, and David Paich’s father was session player, arranger Marty Paich. Given their family history, the Porcaros and David Paich quickly established reputations as stellar musicians playing in local L.A. bands and in studio sessions.\n\nThe addition of session bassist David Hungate and local guitarist, Steve Lukather, completed Toto’s line-up of musicians. Most of the musicians, having been session players for artists such as Steely Dan, Seals and Crofts, Boz Scaggs, and Sonny and Cher, were pursued by CBS Records to put out an album of their own. After signing Bobby Kimball as lead singer, Toto began work on their first of 18 albums in 1977. The airwaves of pop radio are filled to this day with Toto hits, such as “Hold the Line,” Rosanna” and “Africa”, along with the countless records they have recorded as session musicians.\n\nDon Mclean\n\nInfluenced in part by the folk musical group, The Weavers, Don McLean bought his first guitar at the age of sixteen and embarked on what is now an internationally successful career as a singer/songwriter. After graduating from Iona College in 1968, McLean performed in venues up and down the Hudson River with his friend and mentor, Pete Seeger. These experiences led him to Berkeley, California, where he recorded Tapestry during the student riots of 1969. After many rejections, Mediarts released the album where it received good reviews, but little attention outside of the folk community. McLean’s big break came when Mediarts was acquired by United Artists Records, unleashing the promotional power of a major label for his second album, American Pie, featuring the smash singles “American Pie” and “Vincent”.\n\n“American Pie’s” influence in the American folk-rock culture is undisputed. In March, 2017, the song was designated an “aural treasure” by the Library of Congress “worthy of preservation” in the National Recording Registry “as part of America’s patrimony.” McLean’s recording discography also includes: “And I Love you So”, recorded by Elvis Presley and became a #1 hit for Perry Como; “Vincent”, recorded by Josh Groban, performed by Ed Sheeran and was a favorite of Tupac Shakur; “Castles in the Air”, which was a Billboard Top 40 hit in 1981; and “Wonderful Baby”, recorded by Fred Astaire, to name a few. His version of Roy Orbison’s “Crying”, was an international #1 hit and Top 5 Billboard 100 hit in 1981, which Orbison hailed McLean as “the voice of the century”.\n\n“American Pie” was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame in 2002, McLean was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004, received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Lifetime Achievement award in 2012, received a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars in 2019, won three Telly awards for his Home Free collaboration of “American Pie”, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2021, and won six Telly awards for his BT Sports opening of the Fury/White fight in 2022.\n\nAs a highlight to McLean’s career, Martin Guitars created the D-40DM Don McLean Limited Edition “American Pie” Commemorative guitar. Only 71 guitars were built with a card inside the guitar that is signed by both Don McLean and Chris Martin IV. Starting with the neck, the fingerboard features custom hexagon inlays that contain the names of our friends from the song, American Pie. They are the King, Queen, Jester, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Jack Flash, American Pie, as well as Don McLean’s signature inlayed on 20th fret. The headstock inlay is a torch over Ebony, the top is Engelman, Spruce and the back and sides are East Indian Rosewood with a Mahogany neck.\n\nIn 2022, McLean embarked on the 50th Anniversary American Pie World Tour.\n\nMarty Stuart & The Fabulous Superlatives\n\nMarty Stuart is a Country Music Hall of Famer, five-time GRAMMY Award-winner, and AMA Lifetime Achievement honoree, who knows a thing or two about standing the test of time. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Mississippi, Stuart taught himself how to play the guitar and mandolin and landed his first big gig playing in Lester Flatts’ band at the tender age of thirteen, and by twenty-one, he was working on the road and in the studio with Johnny Cash. Though Stuart built his early reputation backing up country and bluegrass royalty, it wasn’t long before Nashville recognized him as a star in his own right, and over the course of forty-plus years as a solo artist, he would go on to release more than twenty major label albums, scoring platinum sales, hit singles, and just about every honor the industry could bestow along the way.\n\n“If country music had a president, it would be Marty Stuart,” famed documentarian Ken Burns once proclaimed. “He is the embodiment of the culture.”\n\nStuart is being inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame with his backing and studio band, The Fabulous Superlatives. Members of this band are, drummer Harry Stinson, guitarist Kenny Vaughan, multi-instrumentalist Chris Scruggs, and engineer/ guitar player Mick Conley.\n\n“From day one, The Fabulous Superlatives have been a good band- never less than a once-in-a-lifetime cast of brilliant musical characters. In 2005 we started becoming a great band when “Mighty” Mick Conley (the invisible Superlative) came into our camp. Mick is also a once-in-a- lifetime character who is loaded with talent. He engineers, produces, and plays on our recordings, television and radio shows, videos, films and concerts.
