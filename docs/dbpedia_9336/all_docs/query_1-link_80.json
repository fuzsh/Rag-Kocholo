        "text": "The collector Randolph Linsly Simpson was born on June 1, 1927, and grew up both in Rochester, New York, where his father, Charles A. Simpson, worked in banking, and in Northford, Connecticut, at the family home of his mother, Eunice Hall Linsly Simpson. After graduating from the Harley School in Rochester in 1945, he served two years in the U. S. Navy, and later worked as a voice teacher. Simpson lived the latter part of his life at the Linsly homestead in Northford.\n\nThe Linslys were among the first to settle Northford, Connecticut, and many generations of the family attended Yale, from Noah Linsly, Yale 1791, to Simpson's older brother Josiah J. L. Simpson, Yale 1948. Simpson's interest in the material record of black history in America was apparently inspired by his family's abolitionist history, and by the proximity of his childhood home on Mount Hope Avenue in Rochester to the cemetery in which Frederick Douglass is buried.\n\nSimpson's large collection of images, artifacts, and other memorabilia documenting the African-American experience drew a great deal of interest during his lifetime. In January, 1984, NBC television aired a one-hour special on the collection, \"Blacks: Present and Accounted For.\" A portion of the collection was exhibited at the Connecticut Governor's Mansion in February 1985 and at the Wadsworth Atheneum in February 1987. In 1989 the Wadsworth Atheneum, through the then titled Amistad Foundation, purchased approximately 7,000 items from Simpson.\n\nSimpson died on January 6, 1992.\n\nThis guide was derived from a list received with the collection from Swann Galleries, possibly created for purposes of appraisal. The Swann document may have been based on Simpsonâ€™s own list of his collection, including his descriptions of the material. For that reason, the library has largely preserved the descriptions from that list, which often include non-standard terminology along with anecdotes and comments about subjects and photographers. In some cases image descriptions have been added where none existed in the original list or expanded to include more detail; obvious typographical errors and errors of transcription were also corrected. Information in the Swann/Simpson list has not been verified, although identifications that were obviously speculative were changed to more objective descriptions of the items.\n\nPrior to its acquisition by the library, the collection was organized by format, and the subseries titles in this guide represent the format designations on the inherited list. The library further organized these format groupings into series. Three addenda consisting of multiple formats were originally filed at the end of the collection, reflecting the collector's acquisition of material after an initial organization and numbering scheme was complete. The items in these addenda were interfiled into Series I-III by the library in order to facilitate digitization, intellectual access, and appropriate physical housing.\n\nFor some years after acquisition by the library, items in the collection were identified only by the item numbers assigned by Simpson; during processing box and folder numbers were additionally assigned. Simpson's item numbers are retained in a note for each item, and material is arranged by item number within each subseries. Gaps in the item number sequence most often reflect removal for separate cataloging (for example, items 1758-1814, 1889-1931) but a few gaps represent items that were not received by the library."
