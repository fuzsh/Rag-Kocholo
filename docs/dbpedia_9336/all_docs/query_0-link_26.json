        "text": "Providing a musical backdrop for many of the nationâs most notable events, The U.S. Army Concert Band has a worldwide reputation for extraordinary musicianship.\n\nHeadquartered in Washington, DC, The U.S. Army Concert Band has performed in concert venues such as Lincoln Centerâs Avery Fisher Hall, Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and Hollywood Bowl--connecting the Army with the American people. The ensemble participates in ongoing, educational outreach and often appears at national and international music events, including the Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic, the Music Educators National Convention, the Texas Bandmasters Association, and the American Bandmasters Association.\n\nDuring the summer months, the Concert Band performs outdoor concerts on the West Steps of the U.S. Capitol and at venues throughout the Washington, DC, area. Regular concerts are offered during the cooler months at The United States Army Bandâs home, Brucker Hall, located on historic Fort Myer, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nIn an effort to promote international goodwill, the 65-piece, traditional concert band has performed joint concerts with the Soviet Army, the Russian Navy, and the Ukrainian Navy bands, and has appeared in military tattoos in Scotland, Sweden, Holland, Norway, Australia, and Japan. The Concert Bandâs 2011 and 2012 goodwill exchange concert tours with the Military Band of the PLA of China, entitled Friendship and Cooperation Through Music, is indicative of the importance these musical ambassadors play in matters of international diplomacy and outreach."
