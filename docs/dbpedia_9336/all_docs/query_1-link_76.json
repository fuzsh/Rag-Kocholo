        "text": "Dear Hannah and Karen and Paul's family I have just discovered the news via LinkedIn and am in tears. I would like to send sincerest condolences and wishes to you all for a long life. I was one of Paul's trainees on a December 2006 training course at Regent's College, when Freddie Strasser was also teaching. It did change my life. I remember driving away through the park and feeling sun had broken through clouds, the cleverness of it all, the case studies from the bug in the ginger beer to the sharing the orange and Paul getting me to drop a journalistic habit of note-taking and just Listen. I last saw Paul by chance at an event to say goodbye to the outgoing Lithuanian Ambassador last autumn (glass and canapés in hand) He always twinkled at me and was ever so warm and kind. I assisted him on one mediation and in return he took me to lunch at the Middle Temple, along the way showing me his amazingly Dickensian office. I took up every recommendation he made, including community mediating for many years for CALM in West London. But, not being a trained lawyer and also not temperamentally an entrepreneur, I never stuck it out as a mediator for money. But I regret I never had a chance to thank him for what I feel was a real gift. I may one day write more of my recollections, and would like to join you at the memorial service. For now please accept my best wishes.\n\nFrom Hester Abrams via email 31st January 2019\n\nIn loving memory of Paul Randolph / Світлій пам’яті Пола Рендолфа, видатного юриста, друга України - український текст нижче Paul Randolph, one of the best mediators in the world, has passed away several days ago. I have talked to some people with whom he was working, and everyone agrees: It is a painful loss! Paul will be remembered for his great experience in Conflict Resolution and psychology of conflict and for training over 1000 mediators. He was an excellent barrister, mediator and lecturer in mediation and law. Paul transferred lots of know-how in Eastern Europe! One of his areas of expertise was alternative dispute resolution. He used this knowledge to facilitate mutual understanding and cooperation – for instance, between the judiciary and the business - in several countries and was full of ideas how to implement it in Ukraine. Paul authored a book about the Slynn Foundation, the organisation where we in Ukraine have many friends. From this book we found out about enormous work the Foundation is doing, in particular the scholarships for young lawyers to get experience in top UK courts – I was honoured to help a couple of Ukrainian lawyers seize this once-in-a-life opportunity. We also found a mutual area of interest in classical music as he played piano, and my mother is a pianist. He was a person with a huge heart in addition to his brilliant mind! Probably the only conflict he could not mediate was the last one, with his terminal illness. During our last talk we discussing a mediation project in our law and order agencies that would help many people save time, money and avoid unnecessary emotions at an early stage of disputes. To respect his memory, we should continue the work that he started. Пол Рендолф, один з кращих медіаторів у світі, завершив свій земний шлях кілька днів тому. Це велика втрата для багатьох! Пола пам’ятатимуть за його велику допомогу у вирішенні конфліктів та глибокі знання у психології конфліктів, а також навчання понад 1000 медіаторів. Він був відмінним юристом та лектором у сфері медіації та права. Пол передав багато знань колегам у Східній Європі! Його досвід в альтернативному вирішенні спорів був величезним. Він використовував його для полегшення взаєморозуміння та співпраці - наприклад, між судовою владою та бізнесом - у кількох країнах і був повний ідей щодо втілення цієї практики в Україні. Пол написав книгу про Фундацію лорда Слінна, організацію, де у нас в Україні багато друзів. З цієї книги ми дізналися про величезну роботу, яку здійснює Фундація, зокрема, про стипендії для молодих юристів, і мені було приємно допомогти нашим молодим спеціалістам отримати безцінний досвід у провідних судах Великої Британії. Ми також знайшли з Полом спільну область інтересу – це класична музика. Він грав на фортепіано, а моя мама - піаністка. Він був людиною з блискучим розумом та величезним серцем! Ймовірно, єдиний конфлікт, який він не зміг владнати, був його останній бій з тяжкою хворобою. Він хотів приїхати в Україну, незважаючи на те, що почувався не так добре, але його родина зупинила його вчасно – завдяки цьому він отримав ще кілька місяців, щоб владнати усі справи, як він завжди робив. Під час нашої останньої розмови ми обговорювали проект досудового вирішення спорів та медіації в наших правоохоронних органах, щоб допомогти багатьом людям заощадити час, гроші і уникнути непотрібних емоцій на ранній стадії спорів. На знак поваги до його пам'яті, ми повинні продовжувати роботу, яку він почав.\n\nFrom Sergei Vakarin via Facebook 21st January 2019\n\nWe are very sorry to announce the death of Paul Randolph on Tuesday, 8 January 2019. John Critchley, Head of Chambers, said: “Paul was a great star in the mediation world and was known nationally and internationally for his distinctive approach to mediation and mediation training. He had a tireless commitment to alternative dispute resolution and was personally responsible for the establishment of Field Court Chambers Mediation Services (https://fieldcourt.co.uk/area/mediation/). He trained many of our mediators and will be greatly missed by his friends and professional colleagues in Chambers and in the wider legal and academic community which he served with such distinction for so many years.” Here is a personal tribute by long-standing professional colleague and friend Spenser Hilliard. Paul Randolph – An Appreciation It was in mediation that Paul Randolph found his true role in life and his untimely death on 8th January 2019 leaves a huge void in the mediation world. Paul practised successfully at the Bar from 1971, eventually specialising in professional negligence. His professional life, however, was transformed when in 1999 he qualified as a mediator with CEDR. Perceiving the important role that psychology plays in the dispute resolution process he proceeded rapidly to establish a ground-breaking mediation course at the School of Psychology and Counselling at Regents College (now Regents University) together with dr. Freddie Strasser, Paul’s uncle and a leading psychotherapist. In 2004 he published, along with Freddie Strasser Mediation: A Psychological Insight into Conflict Resolution and in 2016 he published The Psychology of Conflict: Mediating in a Diverse World. It is a mark of the esteem in which Paul’s work was held that Lord Slynn of Hadley contributed the foreword to the first book and Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote the foreword to the second. For the last 20 years Paul’s professional life has been dedicated to the practice, teaching and promotion of mediation both in the UK and around the globe. He was for many years an elected member of the Board of the Civil Mediation Council and Chair of their Academic Committee. He was a member of the Bar Council ADR Panel and was also a founder member and Adviser to the Trustees of the Slynn Foundation. He played a pivotal role in the development of mediation in Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and the Balkans with long standing ties to mediation associations in Romania, Albania and Croatia. He also travelled much more widely teaching and spreading the word of mediation, with working trips in recent years as far afield as Brazil, Singapore, India, Russia, China and Kazakhstan. He was seemingly immune from jet-lag. Paul particularly relished these foreign trips as they allowed him to pursue some of his interests outside of mediation. He loved assimilating different cultures and was an accomplished linguist, although admitting defeat with Albanian. He was a great gastronome and would enthusiastically seek out local culinary delights in his travels, betraying his Englishness only at breakfast when only egg and bacon would do. He had a lifelong love of music and was a talented pianist with a Steinway grand piano taking pride of place in his living room. He frequently held concerts at home featuring talented young musicians. On a round-number birthday his wife Karen organised for him the opportunity to conduct a professional orchestra. It was a very challenging but deeply satisfying experience and the fulfilment of a lifelong dream. Those who only got to know Paul more recently may be surprised to learn that he was an excellent tennis player. For 18 years he was Chairman of the Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club and combined tennis and legal prowess when in 2005 he won a landmark legal case in the Court of Appeal preventing developers from using the Club grounds to build 10 luxury flats. Above all, Paul was a devoted family man. He could not have been prouder of, or more delighted by, his wife Karen, a local councillor and staunch supporter of his mediation work. She was the power behind the throne. He was also enormously proud of his children, Daniel, a senior manager at Deloittes and his daughter, Hannah, a Practice Manager at St James’s Place. He took particular pleasure in the fact that both Karen and Hannah are qualified mediators and that Hannah is editor of the UK Mediation Journal. Most recently Paul’s seemingly boundless energy was devoted to the Tutu Foundation UK. He was an adviser to the Trustees, founded and chaired their Mediation Service and was a driving force in establishing the Annual Tutu Peace Summit in London. It was shortly after steering the 2018 Summit to a successful conclusion that Paul fell ill, suffering from an aggressive cancer. He had been invited to attend Desmond Tutu’s 87th birthday celebrations in October and desperately wanted to go. Medical opinion was that he would be too ill to make the trip, but with typical determination he rallied sufficiently to get the all-clear and was able to travel to Cape town with his family. When Paul was there, he was transformed and he became the old Paul again. It was a wonderful occasion for everybody attending. Sadly, this remission was of short duration and on his return a decline set in and he passed away peacefully at home on the late afternoon of January 8th surrounded by his family. Until the very end he continued working tirelessly for his various projects with the Tutu Foundation. Spenser Hilliard\n\nFrom Field Court Chambers via website 14th January 2019\n\nPaul Randolph: Barrister, mediator and expert adviser to Tutu Foundation, dies. Tutu Blog - January 14, 2019 We were deeply saddened by the death of barrister, mediator, trainer and writer Paul Randolph, a good friend and expert adviser to the Tutu Foundation UK, who died last week following a recurrence of the cancer that was diagnosed in the spring of 2018. Paul’s death comes as a particular shock as just a few months ago he was responding so well to treatment. Clive Conway, chair of the Foundation, perhaps encapsulated our feelings when, he said: \"We are all shattered and yet pleased to know our very good friend will not suffer anymore. We will build energetically and determinedly on his legacy.” He spoke of Paul’s “massive willpower” which together with medication had meant that in October he had been able to take his family to South Africa for a week to catch the annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture given by President Ramaphosa. The family visit also included a little sight-seeing with a cable-car trip up Table Mountain. But there was also business to attend to. Clive adds that “Paul also came over with me to visit the Head of the Prison Service in Northern Ireland. It was a great meeting and we will now be training prison officers in mediation techniques so close to Paul’s heart and life’s work. Paul worked tirelessly for our foundation visiting India, Belfast on several occasions for starters. He never once said no when I requested something from him.” Paul Randolph was simply a brilliant mediator and a great believer that, given the right psychological techniques you may be able to avoid conflict completely. Working in a wide variety of legal areas, including commercial, family, property, employment and workplace, personal injury and professional negligence, Paul had mediated successfully in disputes with values up to £130 million and with as many as 22 parties. He co-designed, with the eminent psychotherapist the late Dr Freddie Strasser, the Mediation Skills Course at the School of Psychotherapy and Counselling in Regent's University London. Since 1999 Paul had been course leader an adviser to the trustees of the Tutu Foundation (UK) Paul was also author of Psychology of Conflict – Mediating in a Diverse World (Bloomsbury: 2016) which has a foreword by Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu Many will remember the one day workshop he ran for the Tutu Foundation (UK) Training Academy last year which explored managing conflict in the workplace. It showed how the right psychological approach can provide valuable insights into the differing behaviour of people in dispute, to make the management of workplace conflict easier, less stressful and potentially save huge sums of money.\n\nFrom the Tutu Blog - via email 14th January 2019"
