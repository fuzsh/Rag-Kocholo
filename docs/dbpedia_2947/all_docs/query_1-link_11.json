        "text": "Since starting her career in the '90s with a minor role in the Black romance classic, The Best Man, Regina Hall has brought her signature feel-good charm and laugh-out-loud humor to the big screen, portraying a myriad of relatable characters we can't help but return to again and again. Her latest project? She's appearing amongst the impressive ensemble cast that makes up Hulu's Nine Perfect Strangers, a thriller based on the novel by bestselling author, Liane Moriarty. The series marks a rare dramatic turn for Hall.\n\nIn a recent interview with Health magazine, the 50-year-old opened up about how her father's death inspired her to become an actress in her 20s. \"It was his passing that really shifted how I looked at life—I realized how brief it can be and how suddenly it can change,\" Hall said. \"That's what led me to acting. The thing about feeling broken is that it forces you to be open—you feel like you don't have much, so you don't overthink everything.\""
