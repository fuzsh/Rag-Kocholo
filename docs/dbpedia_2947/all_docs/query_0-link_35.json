        "text": "Hey guys, how’s it going? Rahul here coming in with a brand new blog. Hope everyone’s week is going amazing. We have the festival of colours (Holi) coming up this Friday and my birthday this Saturday followed by the SAT next week saturday. So, busy, busy, busy. Let’s begin.\n\nAbout:\n\nThis comedy film was directed by Neil Labute and was release in April, 2010.\n\nDuration: 1 hour 32 minutes (92 minutes)\\\n\nCast:\n\nAaron Barnes (Chris Rock)\n\nRyan Barnes (Martin Lawrence)\n\nNorman (Tracy Morgan)\n\nFrank Lovett (Peter Dinklage)\n\nCynthia Barnes (Loretta Devine)\n\nRussell “Uncle Russell” Barnes (Danny Glover)\n\nMichelle Barnes (Regina Hall)\n\nOscar (James Marsden)\n\nElaine Barnes (Zoë Saldaña)\n\nStory:\n\nA funeral is turned upside down when the Aaron’s father’s lover approaches the funeral demanding for money. Along with this, each member of the family is dealing with their own sort of drama.\n\nReview:\n\nThe movie is one of the most mediocre films I have ever watched. I have no idea what attracted me to this film. The choice of actors is absolutely A1. You legit can’t ask for funnier people than those in this movie and you can clearly see it from the quality of jokes. But, even with all the awesome humour, the story was absolutely awful. A father/ husband has passed away and his gay lover has come to take money threatening to show pictures of how much they loved each other. Seriously, I don’t think they could’ve portrayed this any funnier than they have. They had some hilarious toilet humour and some funny nudity as well. But, the story/ plot was so boring and so badly portrayed that it actually affected the comedy as well. It gave the movie a way too serious aura around it and kind of destroyed the flow of comedy at times. I guess no music is appreciated in this and the fact that the movie is not going through a 100 new scene skips every 10 seconds like a lot of comedy films. But, a little plot development is important for any film and this one failed to deliver. So, great cast, decent directing, decent acting, bad story, and bad plot development. A very below average movie and wouldn’t really recommend this. Overall not so great.\n\nRating:\n\nI would give this movie 2/5 stars."
