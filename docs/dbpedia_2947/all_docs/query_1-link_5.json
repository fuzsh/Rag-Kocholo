        "text": "Is there anything Regina Hall can't do? One of the most versatile actors of her generation, you're as likely to see her starring in a comedy — including Scary Movie, in which Hall first broke out as the now-iconic Brenda Meeks, and the raucously funny Girls Trip — as you are to see her in a drama, delivering grounded, emotionally rich performances in films like the indie dramedy Support the Girls the horror-thriller Master. (Hall even hosted the Oscars earlier this year!)\n\nHer latest role, in the satirical mockumentary Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul., is essentially a Regina Hall masterclass: As megachurch first lady Trinitie Childs, the actress' comedic timing has never been better.\n\n\"I always want something that's a little bit scary, that you're like, 'I wonder, can I do it?'\" she explains. \"Or something I just can't stop thinking about it. And it may not be that it's incredible, but it's like, 'Why can't I stop thinking about that script?!' It continues to resound in my head over and over and over.\"\n\nThe movies that Hall has fallen in love with throughout her life are equally wide-ranging, or, as her Honk for Jesus co-star, Sterling K. Brown, points out as she shares her favorites, \"You got a lot of gangster flicks on your list! Rom-coms and gangster flicks!\"\n\nBelow, Hall shares five of her favorite films with A.frame.\n\n4\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally...\n\n1989\n\nIcon_Audio-Video_-PlayCreated with Sketch.\n\nWhere to watch\n\nDirected by: Rob Reiner | Written by: Nora Ephron\n\nI don't think people realize the genius of Meg Ryan. When you watch her in When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle, she's so seamless. And I love Billy Crystal. I love watching them when they like each other, but they can't admit that they like each other. And then, they're trying to set each other up and they don't know that they are in love with the other. And she's got the pie line.\n\nThere's one scene that I love so much. When she's found out that her ex-boyfriend's getting married. It's so profound. Harry's like, 'Do you want him?' And Sally's like, 'No!' But it was the fact that it wasn't her. And she says, 'And I'm going to be 40!' And she says, '...one day.' It wasn't even logical, but it was emotional and so real. And I will say with Nora Ephron, it's hard to choose one, because I love many of her movies. I love Heartburn. There is such an honesty. I've seen that movie a hundred times. I don't know. That movie makes me happy, because it's a happy ending."
