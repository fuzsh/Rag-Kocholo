        "text": "Regina Hall is starting 2024 off with a bang. As first reported by Deadline, she will be starring alongside Oscar Winners Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn in an upcoming untitled film directed by Academy Award-nominated director Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nAlthough the film’s premise is unknown at this point, this is bound to be a huge artistic and commercial project with this announced package.\n\nProduction is set for this year in California from a screenplay written by Anderson. On deck to produce are Sara Murphy and Adam Somner, best known as Anderson’s producing partners from his critically acclaimed 2021 feature, Licorice Pizza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeadline did say, “We have learned that it is a contemporary setting and it is the most commercial one PTA has attempted, with commensurate budget. “\n\nEven with this A-list topline, the project is being positioned as an ensemble cast with more big names to come. Hall most recently was on Peacock’s The Best Man: The Final Chapters, a franchise she has been a part of since the first feature installment directed by Malcolm D. Lee. The actress was also in the much-acclaimed Honk For Jesus, Save Your Soul. Expect to see Hall broaden her talents in the upcoming Searchlight rock opera film Odessa. Here, she’ll play opposite Kelvin Harrison Jr., Murray Bartlett, and Sadie Sink.\n\nLet’s give Ms. Hall her all the flowers!"
