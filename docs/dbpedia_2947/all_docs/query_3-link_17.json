With numerous ï¬lm and television credits to her name, Hall is one of Hollywoodâs most sought-after actresses and producers.\n\nHall will soon be seen starring in Searchlight Pictures original rock opera OâDESSA, set in a post-apocalyptic future, alongside Sadie Sink, Murray Bartlett, and Kelvin Harrison Jr. Most recently, Hall reprised her role as Candace in Peacockâs âThe Best Man: The Final Chaptersâ starring alongside Taye Diggs, Nia Long, and Morris Chestnut. The series catches up with the beloved characters from the ï¬lm franchise âTHE BEST MANâ and âTHE BEST MAN HOLIDAY.â Hall received an NAACP Image Award nomination.\n\nQuickly establishing herself as a producer to watch, Hall produced and starred in two of the headlining features of the 2022 Sundance Film Festival: the mega church dark comedy HONK FOR JESUS, SAVE YOUR SOUL opposite Sterling K.

She also served as producer on the project.\n\nIn 2017, Hall starred in the fan favorite âGIRLS TRIPâ alongside Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, and Tiffany Haddish. The ï¬lm was a global hit bringing in more than $140 million worldwide and was one of the yearâs biggest and most talked-about ï¬lms. The following year, Hall became the ï¬rst African American actress to ever win a New York Film Critics Circle award for Best Actress for her role in Andrew Bujalskiâs SUPPORT THE GIRLS.\n\nOther past ï¬lms include: âBREAKING NEWS IN YUBA COUNTYâ with Allison Janney and Mila Kunis, âSHAFTâ opposite Samuel L. Jackson, âSUPPORT GIRLS,â âTHE HATE U GIVEâ with Issa Rae and Amanda Stenberg, âWHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS,â âBARBERSHOP 3,â âTHINK LIKE A MAN TOOâ a sequel to Screen Gemsâ âTHINK LIKE A MAN,â âABOUT LAST\n\nNIGHT,â âLAW ABIDING CITIZEN,â âPAID IN FULL,â and âSCARY MOVIE,â as well as its three sequels. Hall also had supporting roles in âLOVE AND BASKETBALLâ and âDISAPPEARING ACTS.â On television, she appeared in guest roles on âGrandfathered,â âInsecure,â and âBlack-ish.â Other credits include âWITH THIS RING,â âMarried,â âLaw & Order: LAâ and âAlly McBeal.â"
