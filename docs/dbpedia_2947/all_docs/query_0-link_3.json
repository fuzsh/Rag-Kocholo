        "text": "You can only live once, but apparently you can die twice. Or, at least you can if you’re the dearly departed in “Death at a Funeral,” the almost shot-for-shot remake of the 2007 British farce of the same name.\n\nOnly the bodies of the living have changed, with the original’s stiff-upper-lip Brits replaced by the less-stuffy Chris Rock, Danny Glover, Martin Lawrence, Zoe Saldana and Tracy Morgan.\n\nThe only holdover, unless you count writer Dean Craig, is Peter Dinklage (“The Station Agent”), again playing the diminutive stranger with a pivotal secret to reveal.\n\nThis version does have the distinction of being directed by Neil LaBute (“Nurse Betty”), who has the unenviable task of both improving on the original and trying to make death funny. Tasks, I might add, that he fails miserably at.\n\nNot that Craig does him any favors with a script that merely replaces the original’s British idioms with references to collard greens, Tupac, Gats, R. Kelly, etc.\n\nClearly, the motive here wasn’t to Americanize as much as it is to Tyler-ize, as in aping the dysfunctional family sagas that have made filmmaker Tyler Perry billions of dollars.\n\nLaBute is no Perry, though. Heck, he can’t even keep pace with Frank Oz, who directed the original “Death at a Funeral.”\n\nReplicating many of the same shots and maintaining the same slapstick tone as Oz, LaBute brings almost nothing new to these cliched (funeral) parlor games.\n\nLaBute even retains the same fundamental flaw: the dearth of laughs emerging from a crazy, mixed-up family, as it gathers for a funeral in the deceased patriarch’s home.\n\nTypical of relatives who only see each other at wakes and weddings, rivalries and resentments quickly surface. There’s also some blackmail, hallucinogens and romance.\n\nIt’s certainly a situation ripe for comedy, but the more absurd the action, the more the film sinks.\n\nLaBute, better known for his misanthropic dramas like “In the Company of Men,” simply lacks the fine touch required to keep his farce from fizzling.\n\nHe needs a steadier hand when juggling the many subplots and a clearer head when it come to wasting time (and our intelligence) on an overwrought and overlong bathroom scene involving cantankerous Uncle Russell (Glover) and his malodorous bowels.\n\nEqually reeking is LaBute’s squandering of a solid cast led by Rock as Aaron, one son of the deceased trying to get through the emotional day. Lawrence plays his brother, Ryan, an arrogant author who’s more interested in creeping on a young woman (Regine Nehy) than mourning dear old Dad. Regina Hall (“Law Abiding Citizen”) is Aaron’s wife, who’s all up in his face about making a baby – today.\n\nOther relatives on hand are the beautiful Elaine (Saldana) and her fiance, Oscar, (James Marsden, in the film’s best performance) who’s hopped up on Valium, courtesy of Elaine’ brother (Columbus Short), a pharmacology student.\n\nExploiting Oscar’s inebriation – he ends up naked on a roof – is Derek (Luke Wilson), Elaine’s ex-lover trying to rekindle the passion. He’s tight with family friend Norman (Morgan), the butt – literally – of much of Uncle Russell’s ire.\n\nAs Elaine attempts to get Oscar down from the roof, her cousins, Aaron and Ryan, contend with the pint-sized stalker Frank (Dinklage). What he has to divulge about their father is shocking. Plus, he’s got photos to back it up.\n\nDespite the all-star ensemble who, for the most part, are endearingly dysfunctional, “Death at a Funeral” is a lazy remake that is a total rip-off of its predecessor with the same end message of love and acceptance. It’s also good for a few laughs, but not much more. Given the success of Tyler Perry’s films, though, this “Death” just might have box office life.\n\nReach Patriot Ledger writer Dana Barbuto at dbarbuto@ledger.com."
