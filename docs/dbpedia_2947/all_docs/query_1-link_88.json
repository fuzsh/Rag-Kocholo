        "text": "Regina Hall is gearing up for a “Midnight Run.” The “Black Monday” and “Nine Perfect Strangers” star has signed on to the sequel to 1988’s “Midnight Run,” an action road trip comedy about a bounty hunter and a mob accountant. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Aeysha Carr (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) is writing the Universal project, and Hall and Robert De Niro, who toplined the original, are producing.\n\nNo plot details are known yet, but it seems the sequel is being set up as a Hall-De Niro vehicle. The first “Midnight Run” starred De Niro “as a bounty hunter who is tasked with tracking down a former mob accountant, played by the late Charles Grodin. The buddy comedy sees the duo traveling cross-country trying to evade both the FBI and the mob,” THR details. “Universal had been trying to get a sequel or remake of the influential comedy off the ground since the 1990s. In the early 2010s, Timothy Dowling was penning a script with the idea of having De Niro’s character, Jack Walsh, paired with a younger comedic foil.”\n\nThe project also counts Jane Rosenthal (“When They See Us”) among its producers, and Sara Scott is overseeing for Universal.\n\nHall won New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for her turn in the dramedy “Support the Girls.” She was most recently seen in the sudsy Hulu drama “Nine Perfect Strangers.” “Girls Trip,” “The Hate U Give,” and “About Last Night” are also among her credits. She previously produced “Black Monday” and “Little,” both of which she also starred in. Next on her slate are the occult drama “Master” and megachurch comedy “Honk for Jesus, Save Your Soul.”\n\nCarr has written for and served as supervising producer on “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” Her other writing and producing credits include “Woke,” “The Carmichael Show,” and “Rel.”"
