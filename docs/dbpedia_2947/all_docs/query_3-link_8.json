        "text": "Regina Hall began her acting career in New York City while simultaneously earning a Master's degree in Journalism from NYU. With numerous film and television credits to her name, Hall is one of Hollywood’s most sought-after actresses and producers.\n\nHall has appeared in cult classics such as The Best Man, Love & Basketball, Paid in Full, and Malibu’s Most Wanted. In 2000, she filmed the first of four of the Scary Movie films and would later go toe-to-toe with comedians like Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Mike Epps, Cedric the Entertainer, Kevin Hart, and more. In 2017, Regina was joined by legends Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, and breakout star Tiffany Haddish in the raucous, blockbuster comedy, Girls Trip. Next up was Andrew Bujalski’s 2018 indie hit Support the Girls, for which Hall gained the attention of film critics, becoming the first African-American actress to ever win a New York Film Critics Circle award for Best Actress for this role.\n\nUnder the banner, Rh Negative, Hall has quickly established herself as a producer to watch. Hall starred in and produced the mega-church dark comedy Honk For Jesus, Save Your Soul opposite Sterling K Brown, for which she received critical acclaim and an Independent Spirit Award nomination, as well as starring in and executive producing the occult drama Master for Amazon Prime. Both films premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, with Honk For Jesus becoming the second highest sale that year to Focus Features. That same year, Hall starred in the #1 Netflix comedy Me Time opposite Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nHall will soon be seen in the Searchlight Pictures original rock opera O’Dessa as well as Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film starring alongside Leonard DiCaprio and Sean Penn."
