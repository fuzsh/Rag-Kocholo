Her work in Support the Girls earned her Best Actress honors from the New York Film Critics Circle and the African-American Film Critics Association. In 2020, Regina signed a first-look deal with Showtime, where she will develop projects to executive produce and potentially star in through her company, Rh Negative.\n\nIn 2006, Regina Hall became personally invested in scleroderma research after her mother was diagnosed and began treatment for the condition.
