        "text": "Theater counts: Spider-Man is back as No Way Home swings into theaters for the Labor Day weekend\n\nSeptember 1st, 2022\n\nAfter a couple of months away from theaters and nearly $1.9 billion in worldwide earnings, Spider-Man: No Way Home once again casts its web into cinemas this weekend, playing in an impressive 3,935 locations and once again becoming the widest release of the week. The new cut of Spider-Man: No Way Home, billed as Spider-Man: No Way Home—The More Fun Stuff Version was announced on twitter back in June in jokey video from all three Spider-Men (Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland). The mega-blockbuster film is not the only wide release to hit theaters this weekend however as Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul makes its theatrical debut in a solid 1,880 locations, while Gigi & Nate arrives in 1,184 theaters. As an extra bonus, another cult classic makes its way back into cinemas as Jaws is being released in 1,246 movie houses. More...\n\nHonk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. trailer\n\nAugust 24th, 2022\n\nComedy starring Regina Hall and Sterling K. Brown opens in theaters and on Peacock on September 2 ... Full Movie Details.\n\nAs the proud first lady of a Southern Baptist megachurch, Trinitie Childs carries immense responsibility on her shoulders. Her church, Wander To Greater Paths, once served a congregation in the tens of thousands, but after a scandal involving her husband, Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs, forced the church to close temporarily, Trinitie is struggling to manage the aftermath. Now Trinitie and Lee-Curtis must rebuild their congregation and reconcile their faith by all means necessary to make the biggest comeback that commodified religion has ever seen. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for July 9th, 2019\n\nJuly 11th, 2019\n\nIt’s a very shallow week on the home market. There are two wide releases, but neither are worth picking up. There were several that are worth owning: Dead of Night, Mothra: SteelBook Edition, Silent Hill: Collectors Edition, and This Island Earth: Blu-ray. However, there was only one true contender for Pick of the Week, Alphaville: Special Edition.

We The Animals topped the list with five nominations, while A24 earned 12 as a studio. More...\n\nLimited and VOD Releases: Searching for a Perfect Limited Release\n\nAugust 24th, 2018\n\nIt’s a great week for limited releases, if you like documentaries, as there are four of them on this week’s list and all of them are earning good reviews. There are also a few films that earned loud pre-release buzz, at least compared to most other limited releases. However, most of these earning reviews that were mixed to good, but not great. The exception is Searching, which should be the biggest hit on this week’s list. More...\n\n2017 Preview: July\n\nJuly 1st, 2017\n\nI hate it when the first of the month lands on a Saturday. By the time this story goes live, we will still have almost no box office data for Despicable Me 3, so we won’t know if June ended on a positive note. Fortunately, Wonder Woman beat expectations and might end up as the biggest hit of the summer, at least for a little while. July begins with Spider-Man: Homecoming, which should make at least $300 million and is the last film being released this summer that has a shot at being a $400 million hit domestically. It is very likely that nothing else this month will come within $100 million of that movie, so that could help its legs. There are a few potential $100 million hits, including War for the Planet of the Apes, Dunkirk, and a couple of other long shots. Last July had a similar feel with The Secret Life of Pets topping the list with well over $300 million, while there were five other $100 million hits. This July would have to beat expectations substantially to match this performance. I’m not confident 2017 will be able to maintain its pace at the box office. I’m worried at least one big film will struggled and 2017 will end the month behind 2016’s pace.

More...\n\n2016 Preview: September\n\nSeptember 1st, 2016\n\nAugust continued to pad 2016’s lead over 2015 in the year-over-year comparison. It managed this feat almost entirely due to Suicide Squad, which is on pace to hit $300 million. The next best film was Sausage Party, which might make $100 million, if it gets a push over the top. September won’t be as strong as that. This is no surprise, as the month is one of the biggest dumping grounds on the calendar. That said, studios have been working to make the end of the month a lot more productive and there are a few potential hits. The biggest of these is The Magnificent Seven, which is expected to crack $100 million, maybe even $150 million. Meanwhile, Sully and Storks both have a limited chance at $100 million. Last September, the biggest release of the month was Hotel Transylvania 2 with pulled in $169.70 million. I don’t think The Magnificent Seven will match that, so we might need a surprise $100 million hit for 2016 to come out on top. More...\n\n2016 Preview: April\n\nApril 1st, 2016\n\nMarch was a really good month, for the most part. There were a few bombs, but the two biggest films, Zootopia and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, both beat expectations by significant margins, so overall the box office was better than expected. Unfortunately, April is a mess, which makes prognosticating really tough. Every single week has at least one film that either moved, switched from wide to limited release, or disappeared entirely. The Jungle Book appears to be the biggest film of the year, but The Huntsman: Winter's War could also be a $100 million hit. Sadly, last April was led by Furious 7, which earned more than $350 million at the box office. That's very likely more than both The Jungle Book and The Huntsman: Winter's War will make combined. Worse still, there were only four weekends in April last year, meaning the month ends by going head-to-head with The Avengers: Age of Ultron. By the time the month ends, 2016's lead over 2015 might be gone. Let's hope it is not that bad. More...\n\n2014 Preview: June\n\nJune 1st, 2014\n\nIt is too soon to tell how May will end, as this story will be published before the weekend estimates came out. (Maleficent had an excellent start on Friday, unlike A Million Ways to Die in the West.) Overall, it was a good month with at least three movies that are on track to hit $200 million, but there was no really big winner for the month. It was nice and balanced. Unfortunately, last May there was a monster hit, Iron Man 3, and 2014 could not compete with that, so it lost ground to 2013. June hopes to turn things around and there are some reasons to be optimistic. All four weeks there is at least one film opening that at least has a shot at $100 million. There are even two films that at least have a shot at $300 million. Transformers: Age of Extinction should win the monthly box office race while How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a long shot to win, but I wouldn't be completely surprised if it did. Additionally, 22 Jump Street, Edge of Tomorrow, The Fault in Our Stars, and Think Like a Man 2 are all contenders for the century club. Not all of them will get to that milestone, but all of them at least have a short. Last June, there were three films that reached $200 million, including Man of Steel, which nearly reached $300 million. It looks like June of 2014 will be about as strong as June of 2013, more or less. If all films reach their potential, it could win the year-over-year comparison. Unless there are some shocking bombs, it shouldn't struggle so much that 2014 loses its lead over 2013 entirely.\n\nMore...\n\n2014 Preview: February\n\nJanuary 31st, 2014\n\nAfter a weak start, January rebounded and a couple of films on last month's preview cracked $100 million at the box office. Granted, Lone Survivor is technically a December release, but Ride Along will become one of the rare January releases to reach the century mark. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be too many February releases that have a real shot at $100 million. It is very likely that The Lego Movie will reach that milestone, but most of the rest of the movies will be lucky if they reach $50 million. Last February was very similar. We had one surprise $100 million hit, Identity Thief, plus a couple of solid midlevel hits, Warm Bodies, for instance. However, for the most part, the month was one miss after another. This means 2014 could continue its winning ways, or at the very least, shouldn't fall behind 2013's pace. More...\n\n2013 Preview: November\n\nNovember 1st, 2013"
