        "text": "The actress turns 53.\n\nBy BET Staff\n\nRegina Hall, a beacon of talent and versatility, celebrates another year today. She looks stunning at 53 as she adds another chapter to her remarkable journey. Let's look back at her film career. With nearly 25 years in films, Regina Hall has never stopped slaying,\n\nThe Best Man (1999)\n\nHall played Candy in this seminal rom-com classic. Her performance as a surprisingly wholesome exotic dancer won her the heart of Harold Perrineau's character, Murch, and got audiences to notice.\n\nLove & Basketball (2000)\n\nImmediately following The Best Man, Hall landed another plum supporting role as Sanaa Lathan's sister in this romantic drama about love and competition.\n\nScary Movie (2000)\n\nHall got a chance to showcase her broad comedy chops in this hit satire by Marlon Wayans. She played high school student Brenda Meeks throughout the franchise.\n\nThe Honeymooners (2005)\n\nHall played a true ride-or-die chick in his feature film remake of the 1950s television series, which also starred Mike Epps as her hustling husband and Cedric the Entertainer as their neighbor.\n\nFirst Sunday (2008)\n\nThe actress starred opposite Ice Cube, Tracy Morgan and Katt Williams in this comedy about three petty thieves who get caught up in a crime ring that puts them in over their heads.\n\nLaw Abiding Citizen (2009)\n\nTaking a departure from comedy, Hall played the wife of criminal prosecutor Jamie Foxx in this action-thriller directed by F. Gary Gray. The film also stars Viola Davis as the mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nThink Like a Man (2012)\n\nHall was truly a standout in this ensemble romantic comedy about couples learning to navigate the rules of love. As a single mom who falls for a younger man, she got to flex her comic chops as well as her leading lady skills.\n\nGirls Trip (2017)\n\nIn this uproarious comedy, Hall embodies Ryan Pierce, a successful author, and motivational speaker. Her character navigates the complexities of friendship, success, and personal fulfillment during a wild and unforgettable trip to Essence Festival.\n\nLittle (2019)\n\nPlaying the role of Jordan Sanders, a powerful tech mogul who magically reverts back to her teenage self, Hall shines in this comedy. She effortlessly embodies the mannerisms of a teenager trapped in an adult body while infusing the character with humor and heart.\n\nBlack Monday (2019-2021)\n\nIn this TV series, Hall graces the screen as Dawn Darcy, a shrewd and ambitious trader in the world of finance. Her character's intelligence and tenacity, combined with Hall's dynamic performance, contribute significantly to the show's appeal and success.\n\nHonk for Jesus. Save Your Soul (2022)\n\n,\n\nThe mockumentary follows Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs (Sterling K. Brown), who tries to revitalize his church after the scandal forced the congregation to temporarily close. Meanwhile, his wife, Trinitie Childs, played by Hall, is willing to do anything to reclaim her throne as the churchâ€™s first lady."
