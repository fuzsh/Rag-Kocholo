        "text": "Regina Hall is not just one of Hollywood’s funniest actresses, she’s also one of the most bankable. Her resume includes starring in blockbusters such as the “Scary Movie” franchise, “The Best Man” franchise and “Girls Trip,” and she has entertained audiences since 1997.\n\nBecause she’s so well known for her comedic roles, her dramatic range and talent often goes underrated. However, in a new film opposite Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn, she will finally get a chance to show her full talents.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Hall has been cast as the female lead in acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film. No details are known about the plot beyond starring alongside DiCaprio and Penn in what’s being described as Anderson’s “biggest production.”\n\nOnline, the casting news was met with excitement by Hall’s fans and peers, including Gabrielle Union who posted, “I was once at a meeting of some of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood. Data was presented of the 10 most BANKABLE actresses working. #ReginaHall was #2. Interesting that the most bankable list wasn’t (surprise) exactly the same as the highest paid actress data that was presented. She is/was/ and forever will be THAT GIRL!! Run her ALL of her things!! #ProudFriendTweet”\n\nWith the kudos, the “Being Mary Jane” star’s comments added another layer to the discussion of pay inequality for Black actresses in Hollywood that recently exploded online because of Taraji P. Henson’s emotional breakdown during an interview promoting the “The Color Purple.”\n\n“I’m only human and it seems every time I do something and break a glass ceiling—when it’s time to renegotiate, I’m at the bottom again like I never did what I just did. And I’m just tired,” Henson said in the interveiw. “I’m tired. I’m tired. It wears on you. Because what does that mean? What is that telling me? And if I can’t fight for them coming behind me, then what the fuck am I doing?”\n\nThe hard truth is Black actresses have been discussing this issue for years, but the powers that be aren’t listening to them. So, perhaps, fans hope, they’ll listen to Anderson, DiCaprio or Penn. If they publicly show support for Hall receiving equal pay, it will make waves in the industry. It’s not a new idea, as Chadwick Boseman took a pay cut to make sure his co-star, Sienna Miller, was paid fairly on the 2019 action film “21 Bridges.”\n\nIt shouldn’t be on these white men to ensure their Black colleagues are fairly compensated for their talent—that’s the studios’ job—but with the conversation making headlines in a way it never has, now is the time to make big moves.\n\nRegina Hall was clearly announced as the female lead of this film, so she should be paid and treated accordingly. Not only is she worth it, but she’s earned it."
