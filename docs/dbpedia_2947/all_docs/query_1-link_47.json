        "text": "If you loved classic body-swapping comedies, like Freaky Friday and Big, put Little on your radar. The upcoming film stars Regina Hall as Jordan, an intimidating tech mogul who bullies anyone who gets in her way‚Äîtweens and her assistant, played by Issa Rae, are not off limits. One morning, Jordan wakes up to a nightmare she didn't know was possible: she's stuck in the body of her 13-year-old self, played by Black-ish breakout star Marsai Martin.\n\nMartin, who is now 14, originally came up with the film's concept at just 11 years old. She expressed her joy via Twitter while sharing the movie's new trailer. The young actress wrote, \"When the world tells you your dream is too big...you search for the folks that can see your vision. God is good!\"\n\nAccording to Girls Trip writer Tracy Y. Oliver, who was also tasked with co-writing a script for Martin's film concept with director Tina Gordon Chism, responded with pride. She recalled pitching the film with Martin to Universal Studios when the actress was just a tween.\n\n\"True story: I went into Universal to do a joint pitch with a then 11 year old @marsaimartin for this movie that SHE dreamt up. So young, but so confident! WAY more than me. Thank you for the honor of writing this movie! Proud of you, girl üëèüëèüëè\" Oliver tweeted.\n\nLittle‚Äîwhich also features Justin Hartley of NBC's This is Us, SNL alum Rachel Dratch, and stand-up comedian Tone Bell‚Äîpremieres in the U.S. on April 12."
