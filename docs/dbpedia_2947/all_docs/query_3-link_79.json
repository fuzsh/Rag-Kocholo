        "text": "I received a few emails this morning about Jordan Peele’s next film, still untitled, set for an October 23, 2026, release.\n\nA few potential names were mentioned as being in talks to star in the film, mostly female actresses. The one name that kept being mentioned is Regina Hall’s who is currently shooting Paul Thomas Anderson’s next film. Other actresses rumored as potentially circling Peele’s next film include Selena Gomez, and Taylor Russell.\n\nHonestly, if it does come to fruition, Peele would be very lucky to have Hall as his lead actress. She never misses. Her best performance is probably in Andrew Bujalski’s underseen 2018 gem “Support the Girls.”\n\nRegardless, we’re going to have to wait another two years before Peele’s next film is released. Last year, Universal set Peele’s untitled fourth film for release on Dec. 25, 2024. A summer shoot was planned for the film, but unforeseen was an impending writer and actor’s strike. Universal eventually removed Peele’s film from its 2024 release slate.\n\nJeff Sneider recently reported the 2024 film, which was rumored to star Daniel Kaluuya and Steven Yeun, was scrapped for an entirely new idea. Like all projects directed by Peele, this one comes in total and utter secrecy, and we probably won’t even know what it’s about until it gets released.\n\nSome have theorized that it might be a sequel to “Get Out,” but I can’t see that happening, just yet. Peele had also teased last year that he wanted to make a sequel to “Nope.” I wouldn’t bet on that one either. It’s definitely another original story and that October date does hint at a horror film, just in time for Halloween.\n\nPeele is a talented filmmaker, with great chops behind the camera, and a promising career ahead of him. 2017’s “Get Out” broke him out in a big way and his ensuing films, “Us and “Nope,” although not as successful, were ambitious and interesting films. Anything he does next must be paid attention to. Stay tuned …"
