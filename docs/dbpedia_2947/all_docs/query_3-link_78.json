        "text": "Regina Hall is set to star in a new, untitled Warner Bros. production alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn. Deadline reported that the film “is a contemporary setting and it is the most commercial one Paul Thomas Anderson has attempted, with commensurate budget.” Variety noted that inside sources have the budget upwards of $100 million, making it Anderson’s most expensive film. The project will also have a “big ensemble cast.”\n\nOther details remain under wraps. Filming will begin later this year.\n\nFans and friends of Hall are thrilled over her new role, even if we don’t know exactly what it is. Gabrielle Union tweeted, “I was once at a meeting of some of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood. Data was presented of the 10 most BANKABLE actresses working. #ReginaHall was #2. Interesting that the most bankable list wasn’t (surprise ) exactly the same as the highest paid actress data that was presented. She is/was/ and forever will be THAT GIRL!! Run her ALL of her things!! #ProudFriendTweet.”\n\nFilmmaker and creative director William Sikora III added, “I love this. Regina has never stopped rising higher. I feel like we all want to see her succeed and witnessing her success take leaps over the past few years has been amazing.”\n\nHarold Perrineau, Hall’s onscreen husband from The Best Man franchise tweeted, “Proud TV Husband over here. The right answer is always Regina Hall.”"
