        "text": "Hall’s role remains under wraps in the still-untitled movie. She’s set to appear alongside Academy Award winners Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn.\n\nThe next Regina Hall movie role is here: The acclaimed actress is set to star in Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film, opposite Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn.\n\nWhile Hall’s role is still under wraps, the upcoming film is shaping up to be the biggest of Anderson’s career, according to Variety. Along with casting Hall, DiCaprio and Penn, Anderson has a budget for the still-untitled project that is nearing $100 million, insiders said.\n\nThe film is described as having a “contemporary setting” in California and will be an “ensemble piece.” For Hall, who has spent well over two decades entertaining audiences, the role comes after a string of acclaimed performances in movies such as “Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul.” and “Master,” both released in 2022.\n\nThe news of Hall’s casting earned praise across social media, with many of her fans sharing their excitement for her.\n\nEntertainment\n\nFeatured\n\nSolange expands her artistry in her latest performance\n\nTheGrio Lifestyle\n\nMusic\n\nUsher and Apple Music tease Super Bowl halftime show\n\nTheGrio Staff\n\nLifestyle\n\nDon Toliver is expecting his first child with Kali Uchis\n\nTheGrio Lifestyle\n\nFeatured\n\nIn case you needed a reminder of how old you are, Destiny’s Child’s breakthrough album, ‘The Writings on the Wall’ came out 25 years ago this year\n\nPanama Jackson\n\nFeatured\n\nDisney+’s ‘Choir’ shows the journey to center stage in the official trailer for Detroit Youth Choir docuseries\n\nGiana Levy\n\nFilm\n\nColman Domingo, Corey Hawkins on tackling Mister and Harpo in ‘The Color Purple’\n\nTheGrio Staff\n\nFilm\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Kane Robinson unpack ‘The Kitchen’ at NY screening\n\nMariel Turner\n\nFilm\n\nRegina Hall to star in Paul Thomas Anderson film\n\nTheGrio Staff\n\nGabrielle Union, a friend and contemporary of Hall’s, took to X to applaud and share insights on Hall’s career, congratulating her while also hinting at how Black actresses, while powerful forces in the film industry, are not often compensated as such, compared to their white counterparts.\n\n“I was once at a meeting of some of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood,” she wrote in the post. “Data was presented of the 10 most BANKABLE actresses working. #ReginaHall was #2. Interesting that the most bankable list wasn’t (surprise) exactly the same as the highest paid actress data that was presented.”\n\nD.C. native Hall “is/was/ and forever will be THAT GIRL!!” Union gushed on X about her friend. “Run her ALL of her things!! #ProudFriendTweet.”\n\nWarner Bros. will produce the Anderson project, and production is scheduled to begin this month.\n\nNever miss a beat: Get our daily stories straight to your inbox with theGrio’s newsletter."
