        "text": "The star says she and costar Regina Hall \"would make each other giggle all day long\"\n\nAnna Faris is ready to reprise her Scary Movie role under a few conditions.\n\nThe star last showed up as the spoof franchise's ditzy-but-well-meaning Cindy Campbell in 2006's Scary Movie 4, and Paramount announced in April that its currently developing a reboot for the series.\n\nWhat would it take for her to sign on for another Scary Movie installment? \"Well, money!\" Faris tells PEOPLE with a laugh.\n\nThe actress, who stars in the new film My Spy The Eternal City, adds that she \"would love to reprise\" her role if it meant costar Regina Hall, who played her character's best friend Brenda, would also return.\n\n\"I would love to work with Regina again. I just love her so much,\" says Faris. \"We would make each other giggle all day long. Regina Hall would be my answer. And money. But mostly all Regina!\"\n\nRelated: Anna Faris Reveals How Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt Reacted to Being Spoofed in Scary Movie (Exclusive)\n\nFaris, who got her big break with 2000's Scary Movie, recalls how she learned her best comedy chops while working on those films.\n\n\"I love that franchise. It was like my bootcamp, my beginnings,\" says the actress, who went on to star on the sitcom Mom and films like The House Bunny and Just Friends.\n\nShe adds, \"If there is a high school comparison for my growth experience, those four movies played an important role in my life in terms of teaching me how to use props, teaching me how to fall, how to get hit in the head — how to hold Chiclets in my mouth and then spit them out with blood at a convenient time for the camera.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFaris and Hall did not appear in 2013's Scary Movie 5, which starred Simon Rex and Ashley Tisdale. While on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen back in 2019, Faris somewhat indicated why she didn't return for that sequel.\n\n\"I didn't see all of it,\" she said at the time about the fifth film. \"Truthfully, here's what I think: I don't know, I always joke that I was too old. ... They wanted to, like, revamp the brand, or whatever.\"\n\nHall, 53, has previously expressed interest in revisiting their outlandish Scary Movie characters decades later. She told Entertainment Tonight in 2022, \"I would love to see where they are now. I don't think it's any place amazing, but I think it'd be fun to see.\"\n\nMy Spy The Eternal City is on Prime Video now.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
