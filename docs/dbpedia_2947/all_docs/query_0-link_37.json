        "text": "As a movie critic, I am naturally averse to remakes. But I've tried my best to move past this prejudice by understanding the motivation for these unoriginal films - filmmakers want to take a great idea and introduce it to a new generation of viewers who might not have seen the original.\n\nOr they are just lazy and figure using a title people are already familiar with will get them more money (much like a politician who slides by on name recognition).\n\nBut a few years ago, a new trend started - I call it the Instant Remake. American studios take a brand-new foreign film and remake it before the original is even available on DVD.\n\nAt first, there was a flood of Instant Remake Japanese horror flicks. There was \"The Ring\" in 2002, remaking \"Ringu\" of 1998. And \"The Grudge\" of 2004, remaking \"Ju-on\" of 2002, as well as \"Dark Water,\" \"Pulse,\" \"The Eye,\" \"Shutter,\" \"One Missed Call\" and probably a few others.\n\nBut now the scope of the instant remake has grown.\n\nThe British comedy \"Death at a Funeral\" graced the Nateflix Best Of the Year list not two years ago, and this week the American remake hits DVD.\n\nThis new \"Death at a Funeral\" changes nothing except for a new cast and tweaked dialogue to fit the non-British environs. And the new cast is a formidable one: Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Tracy Morgan, Luke Wilson, Zoe Saldana, James Marsden, Danny Glover and Columbus Short to name a few. But the story is the same.\n\nA family gathers to mourn the death of the patriarch. There are the usual family feuds and squabbles, of course, which are further complicated by a mysterious outsider with a scandalous secret, and a bottle of valium that is really high-octane mescaline and seems to fall into everyone's hands but the right ones.\n\nThe events of the day quickly escalate beyond anything reasonable, and yet they unfold so logically its impossible not to get caught up in the madness. This was true of the original, and is true in this very faithful remake, as well.\n\nTo put it simply, \"Death at a Funeral\" is a funny story, with funny characters, sharp wit and amazing pacing. It was funny the first time, it's funny the second time, and in five years when they remake it, it will be funny again.\n\nThe thing that makes the Instant Remake different from other remakes is that they make very little changes to anything. \"Death at a Funeral\" works so well because it just copies what worked the first time, and it uses an all-star line up of funny actors.\n\nOf course, the obvious argument is \"Why remake a movie at all if you aren't going to change anything, and the movie in only two years old to begin with?\" And I don't have a satisfactory answer for that.\n\nIn comparing the two movies, the 2007 original still stands as a superior film. But that could be because I find British accents hilarious, or because I saw it first. Whatever the reason, the first \"Death at a Funeral\" is one of the best comedies of the last decade. It's sharp, vulgar and shocking while still having some sweet, human moments. But not too many.\n\nTo anyone who hasn't seen the original, however, this new \"Death\" will be entirely unique and satisfying.\n\n\"Quarantine\": A similar review can be given to this film, which remade the stunning Spanish horror flick \"Rec\" that had come out a year earlier. \"Quarantine\" is a very good movie, simply because it adapts the original film with near shot-for-shot fidelity. Since it is imitating an amazing film in every conceivable way (aside from the language in which it was filmed) it was almost bound to be good.\n\nAnd it IS good. \"Quarantine\" is about a reporter and her cameraman following a group of firemen around for a night. They're called to a building, find a bloody mess and are quickly trapped inside the building when the armed-for-bear Center for Disease Control quarantines the building.\n\nNow our heroes are trapped inside with ghoulish zombies, and the plague is spreading. There is no escape. It's a great set-up for a horror movie, and \"Quarantine\" delivers with plenty of gore, scares and plot twists. The cast is good, the zombies are creepy and the ending is memorable.\n\nAnd if you've never seen the original, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nHowever, compared to the original, \"Quarantine\" seems to be a pale imitation. A good imitation, but still pale.\n\n\"Rec\": The original version is, to put it bluntly, a film that makes you fall in love with horror movies all over again. It's dark, stylish, atmospheric, scary and most importantly, it draws you in so completely you forget you're watching a movie. This is a quality possessed by only the finest horror films.\n\nAs a general rule, one should watch original films over remakes, but in these two cases, the remakes are good, they just aren't GREAT.\n\nAnd the trend is continuing, with the upcoming release of \"Let me In,\" a remake of the recent Swedish film \"Let the Right One In\" which has been lauded as the best vampire movie ever made. And of course \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" which just came out on DVD three weeks ago (and, incidentally, was incredible).\n\nContact Nate Hensley at Nate@nateflix.net.\n\n\"Death at a Funeral\" – Rent it \"Death at a Funeral\" (2007) – Buy it \"Quarantine\" – Rent it \"Rec\" – Buy it\n\nNate rates it:"
