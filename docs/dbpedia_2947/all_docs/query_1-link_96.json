        "text": "Paul Thomas Anderson is lining up the cast for his latest film, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Regina Hall set for the feature.\n\nThe film is set up at Warner Bros., whose studio’s picture group heads Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy worked with Anderson on his last film, Licorice Pizza, during their time at MGM.\n\nAnderson wrote the script and is set produce the film with Adam Somner and Sara Murphy, who worked with the director on Licorice Pizza.\n\nThe logline for this feature is being kept under wraps, but it is due to begin filming soon in California. An ensemble cast is expected for the feature.\n\nLicorice Pizza was nominated for three Oscars, including writing and directing for Anderson, and grossed north of $33 million at the box office. Anderson’s career Oscar nominations now total 11.\n\nDiCaprio was last seen in Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, a role that is expected to earn him another Oscar nomination.\n\nHall, who co-hosted last year’s Oscars ceremony, is known for comedic films like Girls Trip. Her recent roles include the Hulu series Nine Perfect Strangers and Sundance standout Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul.\n\nPenn’s recent credits include Cannes feature Black Flies, the TIFF title Daddio and Patricia Arquette’s directorial debut, Gonzo Girl."
