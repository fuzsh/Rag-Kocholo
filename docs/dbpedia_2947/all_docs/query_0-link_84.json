        "text": "Born in Washington, D.C., Regina Hall graduated from Fordham University in the Bronx in 1992, earning a bachelor's degree in English, before enrolling at New York University, where she got her master's degree in journalism in 1997. During her first semester at NYU, Hall's father died unexpectedly of a stroke. Realizing that life is short, Hall abandoned her plans to become a journalist and instead pursued a career in acting. She got her first role not long after graduation, appearing in a TV commercial at the age of 26, and quickly landed guest roles on the soap opera \"Loving\" (ABC, 1983-1995), and the police drama \"New York Undercover\" (FOX, 1994-1998). Hall's first movie role was a supporting part, Candace \"Candy\" Sparks, in Malcolm D. Lee's romantic comedy \"The Best Man\" (1999). The film proved to be an unexpected hit, with critics and audiences taking note of Hall's performance. During shooting, Hall became good friends with co-star Sanaa Lathan, which lead to them both being cast in the romantic drama \"Love and Basketball\" (2000), another unexpected hit, which solidified Hall as a rising star in so-called \"black Hollywood.\" Hall got to show off her comedic chops with a lead role in the Wayans Bros smash hit parody \"Scary Movie\" (2000), and went on to appear in the next three entries in the franchise: \"Scary Movie 2\" (2001), \"Scary Movie 3\" (2003), and \"Scary Movie 4\" (2006). In 2001, Hall joined the cast of the legal dramedy \"Ally McBeal\" (FOX, 1997-2002) for the show's penultimate season. After that show ended, Hall continued to work prolifically in film, appearing in the likes of \"Paid in Full\" (2002), \"Malibu's Most Wanted\" (2003), \"King's Ransom\" (2005), \"The Honeymooners\" (2005), and \"Law Abiding Citizen\" (2009). In 2010, Hall joined the hallowed \"Law & Order\" (NBC, 1990-2010) series, when she was cast as Deputy District Attorney Evelyn Price in the spinoff \"Law & Order: L.A.\" (NBC, 2010-2011), which only lasted a single season. Hall quickly rebounded, however, when she co-starred in Steve Harvey's hugely successful battle of the sexes comedy \"Think Like a Man\" (2012), which she immediately followed up with the highly anticipated sequel to her debut film, \"The Best Man Holiday\" (2013), and yet another big hit, a remake of \"About Last Night\" (2014), in which she was perfectly paired with Kevin Hart. That same year, Hall appeared in another successful sequel, \"Think Like a Man Too\" (2014), before taking a change of pace to co-star as love interest to Flight of the Conchords' Jermaine Clement in the indie dramedy \"People Places Things\" (2015). Hall continued her winning streak at the box office with starring roles in Ice Cube's comedy \"Barbershop: The Next Cut,\" and the critically acclaimed raunchy comedy \"Girls Trip\" (2017). After co-starring in the Marlon Wayans comedy \"Naked\" (2017) and the comedy \"Support the Girls\" (2018)"
