        "text": "Regina Hall is one of three women hosting the 2022 Oscars (along with Wanda Sykes and Amy Schumer), a high point for the hard-working actress after 20+ years in the industry. The versatile star first emerged as a talent to watch in 1999’s “The Best Man,” but it was the following year’s one-two punch of “Love & Basketball” and particularly “Scary Movie” that helped her become a presence in Hollywood that was here to stay. Scroll through our gallery below to see the Top 10 Regina Hall movies ranked worst to best.\n\nIn the years that followed, Hall delivered standout supporting performances in a wide swath of comedies, including “Malibu’s Most Wanted,” “King’s Ransom” and “The Honeymooners,” on top of the subsequent “Scary Movie” films. She also had a recurring role in the later seasons of the TV dramedy “Ally McBeal.” Her knockout comedic timing ultimately led to more substantial roles moving forward, while also branching out into dramas and thrillers like “Danika” and “Law Abiding Citizen.”\n\nThe 2010s saw even greater success for Hall, reprising her very first role as Candy in “The Best Man Holiday” among other ensemble-based comedies. One of her most successful films both commercially and critically was “Girls Trip.” But it wasn’t until “Support the Girls” in 2018 that Hall found her most acclaimed role yet as the hardworking general manager of a sports bar, a role that netted her the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress among other accolades."
