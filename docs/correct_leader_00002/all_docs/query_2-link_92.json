        "text": "It is now 20-years since Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced the U.K. government's decision to sell gold and reinvest the proceeds in foreign currency deposits, including Dollars and Euros.\n\nAt the time, the value of the U.K.’s gold reserves were $6.5 Billion, which was approximately 50% of all the U.K.’s foreign exchange reserves. The policy was pursued between 1999 and 2002 at a time when gold prices were at their lowest in 20 years.\n\nOn May 1, 1999 the gold price was $272.90/Troy Ounce. It fell to $254.85/Troy Ounce in August 1999 and by the end of 2002 prices had booked a mild recovery to $361.075/Troy Ounce. By October 2011 the price climbed steadily to peak at $1658/Troy Ounce. It is hardly surprising then that the period during which Gordon Brown oversaw the sale of the gold has become known as “The Brown Bottom”.\n\nOne might look at the price move and ask why on earth did the Chancellor decide to take such a course of action? His stated aim was to diversify the nations foreign exchange reserves into a range of currencies and reduce the weighting assigned to gold which the Chancellor judged to be too volatile a commodity.\n\nGordon Brown demonstrated a complete failure of understanding how markets worked. Gold prices had been in a gentle decline since the start of 1990 and by the time the decision was made public on May 7, 1999 the price had fallen by 30%.\n\nWhy sell at all? An econometric study commissioned by the Treasury had suggested the volatility of the U.K.’s foreign exchange portfolio could be reduced by 20%. However, what was ignored was the fact that the gold price had been in a bear market for nine-years and instead of a major statement he could have discretely sold a small amount to test the waters.\n\nThe “Blair/Brown” years (1997 – 2010) were packed with grandstanding projects and as such Brown’s strategy was to sell the gold in a series of auctions and use the proceeds to finance a series of purchases in foreign currency denominated instruments. The process was a series of Dutch auctions, forcing the U.K. into accepting the lowest bid from the allowed bidders, i.e. the six largest private British Banks.\n\nHowever, by openly telling the market of his intent at the time of the first auction on July 6, 1999 the price had fallen another 10% as gold traders aggressively shorted the market knowing they would be able to cover their shorts with ease as the U.K. began unloading half of its holding.\n\nA market trader would have told Brown not to jump into a long running bear market and never reveal one’s hand in such a naïve manner. Basically, the bullion boys had Brown for breakfast.\n\nIndeed, they returned to the buffet table several times as the U.K. eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275/Troy Ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 Billion\n\nAt first, there was not too much fall out as the gold price held the lower levels until 2001 when the price started to appreciate as the bear market was exhausted.\n\nThe short positions were squeezed out completely in October 2002 when President George W. Bush obtained congressional approval from a Democrat-led Senate and Republican-led House authorising him war-making powers. The Iraq war began on March 19, 2003, when the U.S., joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies, launched a massive bombing campaign.\n\nGold rallied on a flight to safety trade and moved into long bull market. By 2007, the price of gold had reached US$675/Troy Ounce.\n\nThe net loss to the U.K. taxpayer was estimated at more than £2 Billion ($2.8 Billion), only ameliorated as the Euro denominated assets bought with the proceeds had also risen in value.\n\nThis is an episode of U.K. economic history that has always drawn criticism. Many have called Brown naïve for signalling his intent so openly. One would never play poker in such a way. I must agree. He was a politician...not a trader by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nOne could contend that it is wrong to use the prism of 2019 to judge the actions taken in 1999.\n\nHowever, what never changes over the ages is the willingness of an individual to own their mistakes.\n\nOne this measure, the rule of rectitude is not kind to the former Chancellor and Prime Minister. One cannot escape the conclusion that the custodian of the U.K.’s financial health some 20-years ago was completely wrong.\n\nGordon Brown resisted attempts to release private advice to the Treasury once the gold price began to rise. He even said it has been done with the blessing of the then-Bank of England Governor, Sir Edward (Eddie) George.\n\nThis was wrong and was nothing less than a brazen attempt by Brown to at least share the blame if not pass it on completely. Eddie George and a fellow member of the Bank's executive, Ian Plenderleith raised strong objections to the government's decision to sell half Britain's gold reserves. They were out voted by a coalition of the Treasury and some central bank officials including Deputy Governor Mervyn King. Mr George saw the proposed gold sale as a further erosion of the Bank's power base in the City at a time when Chancellor Brown was meant to have made the bank independent.\n\nEddie George said it was essential for the Bank of England to hold a large proportion of its reserves in gold because of the City of London's pre-eminent role in the bullion markets. The Bank's technical management of gold reserves for more than 40 other central banks and monetary institutions around the world gave it symbolically important status in the gold market. This would be diminished if it was selling off its own holdings.\n\nHe also argued that as the U.K. was a member of the group of seven leading industrial countries (G7), it has a responsibility to hold a significant proportion of its reserves in gold, as did the U.S. Germany and Japan.\n\nThis is a sad and sorry saga that reminds us all that as with Suez, Miners Strike, Winter of Discontent, Poll Tax, Black Wednesday...the gold sales of 20-years ago and Brexit are just another two examples of great British calamities."
