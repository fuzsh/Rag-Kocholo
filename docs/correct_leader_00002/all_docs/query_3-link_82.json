This expansion of spending was justifiable in many ways, given poor investment in public services during the Thatcher-Major years. But it was arguably not sufficiently financed through taxation, and direct taxation in particular. The result was a run up of public deficits prior to the current financial and economic crisis, which broke the government's own fiscal rules. This in turn prepared the way for a substantial deterioration in public finances when the current crisis broke, a deterioration which may take years, if not decades to set right.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Intent of Prudence and Stability\n\n6In terms of public finances and fiscal policy, the 1997 manifesto clearly stated that a future Labour government: would not change income tax rates (for at least five years); would respect spending plans set out by the Conservatives for two years, and lastly that it would adopt “strict rules” concerning government borrowing. These rules were subsequently refined and formally presented to Parliament in the Budget of March 1998. They were:\n\nthe Golden Rule: over the economic cycle the Government will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure; and\n\n9 HM Treasury, 1998 (a).\n\npublic debt as a proportion of national income will be held over the economic cycle at a stable and prudent level .\n\n10On the tax side, New Labour did stick to its tax pledge of not raising income tax rates. In particular, the 40% upper rate, which had been implemented by the Conservatives in 1988, remained in place. It was a “red line” of the Thatcher legacy which New Labour refused to cross for fear of losing electoral support from “Middle Britain”. It only came into question towards the end of 2008, when, facing the full gales of the financial crisis, Alistair Darling (Gordon Brown’s successor as Chancellor) announced the introduction of a 45% rate in April 2011. In the event, a new rate of 50% for income over £150,000 was introduced in the last Labour budget of March 2010, and was retained by the subsequent Conservative budget of June 2010.\n\n11However, Gordon Brown did use “fiscal drag” substantially to help raise revenue generated by income tax and indeed other taxes (i.e. allowing thresholds to rise less quickly than inflation and salaries, so that a greater share of taxpayers’ revenues is progressively taxed at higher rates). As a result, income tax expanded quite notably as a share to total public sector receipts during New Labour’s first government, and then levelled off (see Table 4). New Labour’s policy was also to expand tax revenues through increases in stamp duty on property and stock market transactions. Various other types of indirect taxes also contributed to the government’s revenues, as we shall see in the next section. Dubbed “stealth taxes” by the government’s (Conservative) critics, these taxes include Value Added Tax (VAT), excise on alcohol and fuel, etc. They are generally considered to be less visible to the public and so less damaging politically – hence the term “stealth taxes”. But, indirect taxes are far more regressive in nature than income tax, because they are either flat-rate (tax hikes on beer and petrol) or proportional (VAT, stamp duty). They therefore increase the overall tax burden on poor households more than on rich households.\n\nGordon Brown and New Labour’s Public Finance Record\n\n12New Labour came to power in 1997 at a generally favourable moment in Britain’s post-war economic history. Though widely held as a political disaster at the time, sterling’s ERM exit had given the authorities (then the Chancellor, not the Bank of England) the possibility of continuing to lower interest rates, and letting the pound devalue. Unusually, this did not lead to higher inflation as was much feared at the time: deindustrialisation, privatisation, labour market deregulation and a second bout of mass unemployment in the early 1990s had finally brought about a considerable fall in wage increases. As a result, the weaker pound did help restore Britain’s competitiveness and was not accompanied by a surge in inflation. The Conservatives under John Major had also become more pragmatic, after the poll-tax debacle and a much-reduced Parliamentary majority following their re-election in 1992. In the face of a deep recession, they allowed the deficit on public spending to rise to 7.5 percent of GDP, in 1993. When growth returned, they managed to implement a considerable improvement in public finances, holding down spending growth while raising taxes, and by 1997 the British economy was experiencing stable growth, low inflation, falling unemployment and improving government finances.\n\nTable 1: Public Sector Spending and Receipts (as a % of GDP)\n\nTable 2: Components of Net Borrowing (Columns 1 to 4) and Debt (Columns 5 and 6): as a % of GDP\n\n15At the same time, however, New Labour made much of wanting to improve public services, notably by raising capital spending. One way of partly doing this, without increasing direct spending by the government, lay in the expansion of private finance for public infrastructures. This was a policy launched in 1992 by John Major’s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Norman Lamont: the so-called Private Finance Initiative (PFI). It is based on the idea of paying private companies to build and manage public infrastructures, which after a period of usually 25-30 years then become fully-owned public assets. Under present public accounting rules, such spending is largely “off balance sheet”, with only the annual fees paid to contractors entering government accounts.\n\n18As for government spending itself, the start of the 2000s marked a fundamental change in New Labour’s fiscal policy. It was freed from its electoral commitment in 1997, and both public spending and public sector debt had fallen significantly as shares of GDP. Consequently, New Labour was able to increase public spending strongly after securing a renewed Parliamentary majority (of 167 seats) in the 2001 general elections. Spending in health and education subsequently increased substantially both in real terms, and as a share of GDP. This was especially the case for the NHS. Following New Labour’s pledge of bringing the United Kingdom’s share of GDP spent on health up to the European average of 8%, the NHS experienced its biggest rise in funding since its creation (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Public Expenditure on Services (as a % of GDP)\n\n19Other public services saw their spending as a share of GDP essentially maintained, and so too benefited from greater expenditure following on from stable and buoyant growth. The same holds for income transfers (“Social protection”) which expanded in some areas, in particular where aimed at fighting child poverty and enhancing the resources flowing to pensioners. In other areas like unemployment pay – the so-called Jobseeker’s allowance – the lid on benefits was held down tightly, partly for fiscal reasons, and partly to ensure that labour market “incentives” were firmly set to encourage people to work. As a result, the share of GDP taken by transfers remained quite stable in the first decade of New Labour’s years in office, and only expanded significantly with the onset of the financial and economic crisis in late 2007.\n\n20Examining the effectiveness and efficiency of the substantial increases in public spending falls outside the scope of this paper, though the overall assessment is usually mixed: public services are deemed to have generally improved under New Labour, but not by as much as was hoped, given the financial efforts made. What is clearly of interest here, however, is that New Labour’s willingness to improve services – shared by both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – did put an increasing strain on public finances by the mid-2000s.\n\n21Overall, Gordon Brown, as Chancellor, presided over an increase in Total Managed Expenditure from 36.8% of GDP in 2000-01 to 41.1% of GDP by 2005-06. Thereafter spending did fall marginally to 40.9% of GDP in 2007-08, before rising again strongly with the onset of the financial and economic crisis. While tax receipts were also rising in real terms, they did not fully match this rise in spending. As a result, net public sector borrowing grew quite substantially in the first half the 2000s, rising to 3.3% in 2004-05 (or 3.5% with Maastricht accounting – see Table 2). Thereafter, above-trend economic growth (i.e. above the Treasury’s estimate of potential growth of 2.5% at the time), together with somewhat higher taxation and a slowdown in spending growth, did lead to a narrowing of the public sector borrowing, up until the crisis.\n\nTable 4: Composition of Public Sector Revenue\n\n23The composition of public revenues under New Labour appears to have varied most during Gordon Brown’s first Chancellorship, which saw the share of revenues from income tax rise by 3%, whereas the shares of corporation tax, VAT and Council tax/Community charge/Domestic rates fell by about 1%. Thereafter, the contributions to revenue remained relatively stable through to the start of the crisis. Only stamp duty saw its contribution rise significantly from the start of the first New Labour government through to the crisis, while contrary to the accusations frequently levelled at the government, “stealth taxes” on fuel, tobacco, spirits, wine, beer & cider duties actually contributed a lower share to public sector receipts in 2007-08 than they did in 1996-97 (see Table 4).\n\nBreaking the Fiscal Rules and the Great Recession\n\n25A less partisan assessment, which by no means amounts to an absolution, has been given, among others, by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). In evaluating New Labour’s fiscal record, the IFS summarises:\n\n23 Ibid.; Chote et al., 2010.\n\n“...over the same ten years [i.e. 1997 to 2007] the vast majority of other leading industrial countries reduced their borrowing by more than the UK. And most also reduced their debt by more. So while the UK public finances were in better shape when the financial crisis began than they were when Labour came to power, the UK was in a worse position relative to most comparable countries” .\n\n28Gordon Brown can indeed be accused of having been overly optimistic about Britain’s growth prospects and hence likely tax receipts on the one hand and too willing to spend money to improve services on the other hand. The combination of providing substantial sums of money for services, permanent reform in many areas, often aimed at encouraging market-style practices and hence employing financial incentives to raise the output of services, etc., did mean that public money was not always spent as efficiently as could have been possible.\n\n29Similarly, while the government did raise the share of “net taxes and national insurance contributions” in GDP in the immediate years before the crisis (from 35.2% in 2004-05 to 36.2% in 2007-08 – see Table 1), its overall willingness to let taxes pay for services was constrained, and so the public deficits piled up. Also, though income tax continued to be the largest source of revenue, there is a case to be made that Gordon Brown became increasingly reliant on the buoyancy of companies and financial services in topping up revenues (through corporation tax and stamp duty especially). “Prudence” had given way, if not exactly to profligacy, then at least to a certain insouciance about the sustainability of New Labour’s economic policies and its model of public services. This model was based on the premise of persistent economic growth, led notably by the City and Britain’s deregulated financial services. Such growth, in turn, provided the tax funding and/or the possibilities of almost-limitless borrowing to finance services. At the same time, market-oriented reforms in the management of services were seen as the key to making them more productive, though the evidence for this is mixed. On balance, public services under New Labour did become more effective in meeting public needs, but not necessarily as efficient in their use of resources as the government had hoped.\n\n30When the financial crisis broke out, the entire basis of this model broke down. Gordon Brown as Prime Minister was forced into stepping in forcefully to support the banking sector and financial services: the so-called “light-touch” regulation of financial services had led to a disaster, as British banks had to be bailed out massively. The Brown government also found itself having to support aggregate demand (through the 2.5% cut in VAT announced from December 2008 to the end of 2009, for example), while juggling with collapsing tax revenues as economic activity slowed precipitously (see Table 4). Not surprisingly, Britain’s public deficit ballooned to proportions, not seen since World War II: in 2009-10 net borrowing exploded to over 11% of GDP (see Table 2).\n\nConclusion\n\n32Gordon Brown, as shadow Chancellor and then Chancellor, held wide-ranging responsibilities in shaping New Labour’s economic and public policy programme. His views on society and policy, as well as his subsequent actions in office, shaped by his close collaboration with Ed Balls, were vital in integrating many parts of the Thatcher-Major legacy into the New Labour agenda. Not surprisingly, this led him first to consolidate New Labour’s economic reputation, making economic policy more “rules-based” and respecting the imperatives of fiscal austerity.\n\n33With New Labour’s re-election in 2001, he was then able to orchestrate a large increase in public spending, to help improve services that were widely seen to have been run down during the years of Conservative government. If Gordon Brown did not exactly throw caution to the wind during the prosperous years before the present crisis, he certainly tried to have his cake and eat it: massive resources were poured into public services, especially health and education, and this growth in spending was not matched by enough higher taxation. New Labour was just as keen as the Conservatives to present itself as a party of low taxation, even if its record in this field is more nuanced. As a result, Gordon Brown may rightly be criticised for having undermined public finances, even though the headline figures hardly indicated a dramatic deterioration against the background of Britain’s long period of sustained growth.\n\n34Yet, in his enthusiasm for market forces and deregulated finance – albeit tempered by his Scottish moral sentiments – Gordon Brown does appear to have been blind to the possibilities of a major financial and economic crisis that would shake the neo-liberal global economy which had been progressively put into place since the late 1970s. Though he did substantially increase spending on public services and raise funding to fight some forms of poverty, he also gave a free hand to finance and international capital. When the crisis did finally come, it plunged Britain’s public finances into dire straits, from which they will take years, if not decades, to emerge. So far this has not led to a substantial re-ordering of the economy. The beneficiaries of neo-liberalism have scarcely been held to account or seen their economic freedoms curtailed. The long term costs of the Great Recession in Britain look set to fall largely on those not responsible for it, and they may well be socially devastating."
