In 1972, while still a student, he was elected Rector of the University.\n\nDuring the 1970s he lectured in politics at Glasgow College of Technology and was a tutor for the Open University. From 1980 until 1983 he worked for Scottish Television, first as a journalist and then as the current affairs editor.\n\nIn 1983 he entered Parliament as MP for Dunfermline East (which was subsumed into Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath in 2005) and shared an office with Tony Blair. He held several shadow cabinet posts before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992.\n\nAfter the death of John Smith in May 1994, Brown did not contest the Labour leadership, standing aside to allow Tony Blair to represent the modernising wing of the party. In return, Blair is said to have agreed to give Brown control of economic policy.\n\nWhen the rebranded 'New Labour' party won its first landslide election victory in 1997, Brown was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. He held the post throughout Tony Blair's premiership, becoming the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.\n\nIn 2000, at the age of 49, he married Sarah Macaulay. The couple endured great sadness: their first child, a girl, lived for only one day, and one of their two sons was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.\n\nFollowing Tony Blair's resignation, Brown became Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party on 27 June 2007.\n\nIn the autumn of 2007 advisors tried to persuade him to call a general election, which opinion polls indicated he would win, but he declined to do so. It was a costly mistake: within a year, a banking crisis and a global recession had thrown the economy off course, Parliament was brought into disrepute as the result of a scandal involving MPs' expenses claims, and David Cameron had revived the Conservative Party's fortunes. Labour suffered its worst local election results for forty years in May 2008 and fared equally badly in European elections. Some Labour backbenchers began calling for a leadership contest and there were rumours of plots against Brown.\n\nThe general election on 6 May 2010 resulted in a hung Parliament. After several days of anxious negotiations between the parties, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister and Labour leader on 11 May, and David Cameron was invited by the Queen to form a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.\n\nBrown continued to serve as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until May 2015, when he stood down.\n\nIn July 2012 he accepted the unpaid posts of United Nations Special Envoy on Global Education and Chair of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity; and in 2015 he was appointed as an advisor to the Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), the income from which he gave to the Gordon and Sarah Brown Foundation to support charitable work.\n\n(For more on the political background of this period, see the Wikipedia pages on Gordon Brown and The premiership of Gordon Brown, from which much of the above information is taken.)\n\nEducation department\n\nOn becoming Prime Minister in June 2007, Gordon Brown immediately announced that the education department would be split into the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS).\n\nThere was some logic to this division.\n\nDCSF brought together all policy relating to children and young people: in addition to overseeing schools, it shared youth justice with the Ministry of Justice, child poverty with the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions, children's health with the Department of Health, and youth sport with the Department for Culture. It also took from the Home Office the 'Respect agenda', which had been launched by Tony Blair in 2005 to help local communities tackle antisocial behaviour.\n\nDIUS took science and innovation from the Department for Trade and Industry and was to be responsible for the development, funding and performance of teaching and research in higher education. One of its main aims was the improvement of graduate skills. It would also oversee the £4bn adult portion of the Learning and Skills Council budget, and adult learning schemes such as the Train to Gain workplace education initiative.\n\nBut there were complications in the arrangement. DCSF was to set education policy for students up to the age of 19, but work with DIUS on reforms for the 14-19 age group. School pupils in this group and sixth-form college students would come under DCSF, but general further education college students and apprentices aged 16 to 19 were to be the responsibility of DIUS, though they would be funded via local education authorities. The future of the Learning and Skills Council, which lost much of its budget, was left in some doubt (The Guardian 3 July 2007).\n\nIn the event, DIUS lasted for only two years. In June 2009 it was abolished and its responsibilities subsumed into a new Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), led by Peter (Lord) Mandelson.\n\nPersonnel\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the day after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, Ed Balls was appointed Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (he was commonly known as the children's secretary); John Denham became Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills.\n\nThe opposition spokesmen for the two departments - Michael Gove and David Willetts - were appointed on 2 July 2007.\n\nEd Balls\n\nEd Balls (1967- ) (pictured) attended Nottingham High School, read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Keble College Oxford, and then Economics at Harvard.\n\nAfter teaching at Harvard for two years, he joined the staff of the Financial Times in 1990.\n\nA member of the Labour Party since his schooldays, he became an adviser to Gordon Brown in 1994, and entered Parliament as MP for Normanton (which later became Morley and Outwood) in 2005. He was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury in 2006, and Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in June 2007.\n\nFollowing Labour's election defeat in May 2010, Balls served as Shadow Secretary of State for Education until 8 October, when the new party leader, Ed Miliband, appointed him Shadow Home Secretary and, in January 2011, Shadow Chancellor.\n\nAfter losing his seat at the 2015 election, Balls became a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government and a Visiting Professor to the Policy Institute at King's College London.\n\nJohn Denham\n\nJohn Denham (1953- ) (pictured) read Chemistry at the University of Southampton, where he was President of the Students' Union in 1976-77.\n\nHe worked for a number of organisations including Friends of the Earth, War on Want, Christian Aid and Oxfam. He served as a local councillor in Hampshire and, for several years, was a member of the Executive Committee of the Fabian Society.\n\nIn 1992 he entered Parliament as MP for Southampton Itchen and held various ministerial posts in Tony Blair's administrations, including that of Minister of State at the Home Office, a post from which he resigned in March 2003 in protest at the Iraq war.\n\nHe returned to government when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, serving as Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills from 28 June 2007 to 5 June 2009, and then as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government until 11 May 2010. He resigned his Commons seat at the election in May 2015.\n\nIn November 2015 Denham became Professor of English Identity and Politics at Winchester University.\n\nAndrew Adonis\n\nAs noted in the previous chapter, Andrew (Lord) Adonis had wielded enormous influence over education policy in the Blair administrations. He held on to his post as schools minister when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, but his influence waned and, in October 2008, he was moved from education to the Department of Transport.\n\nEarly days\n\nInaugural statement\n\nEd Balls made his inaugural statement as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in the House of Commons on 10 July 2007. He began by explaining that his new Department brought together 'for the first time ever in one place the responsibility for all policy across Government to promote the well-being of children and young people' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1319).\n\nHe outlined what had been achieved by the Blair administrations:\n\nAfter decades of underperformance, we have turned the tide. We have rising standards - more than 58 per cent of 15-year-olds achieved five or more good GCSEs in 2006, compared to only 45 per cent in 1997. There is new investment, with 35,000 more teachers, 172,000 new classroom assistants, more than 1,100 new schools and more than 1,300 Sure Start children's centres. Teenage pregnancy rates are at a 20-year low. Re-offending rates among young people are down, and 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1319).\n\nThere were, however, still 'significant challenges', and Balls announced that the government would take immediate steps 'to reinforce our focus on standards in the classroom and personalised learning; to back teachers and improve discipline in and out of school; and to strengthen school leadership' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1319).\n\nSir Peter Williams, Chancellor of Leicester University and chair of the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education, would conduct a review of maths teaching in primary schools, building on 'the successful numeracy strategy that we launched nearly 10 years ago' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1319).\n\nThe testing regime would be maintained: it was 'essential for monitoring the progress of individual pupils'; but schools would be allowed to make 'well-informed judgments on when pupils should be tested'. The government did not approve of streaming, but strongly supported setting for individual subjects, 'with judgments made by heads and teachers, according to the needs of their school' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1320).\n\nBalls confirmed the government's intention that all those up to the age of 18 should be in some form of education or training:\n\nTo secure our economic future and promote opportunity for all, we must also do more to improve the post-16 staying-on rate. We will legislate over the coming year to raise the education leaving age to 18, but we also need a 14-to-19 curriculum that is relevant and engages young people in learning, offering them the skills that they need for future study and to succeed in the workplace. Details of the first five new 14-to-19 diplomas will be available within the month and be ready to be introduced into schools and colleges in September 2008 (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1320).\n\nHe announced that the government would find an extra £265m over the next three years\n\nto enable extended schools to do more to support disadvantaged children and young people. By year three, the funding will enable all schools to offer those children two hours per week of group activities in term time, plus 30 hours of additional activities over the holidays (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1320).\n\nThe Department would examine ways of further reducing 'unnecessary burdens' on teachers and heads so that professionals could 'get on with the job in the classroom' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1320).\n\nHe promised a 'more focused' secondary curriculum 'that teaches the basics, but reduces prescription and puts more power in the hands of individuals schools and teachers' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1321). There would be a greater focus on classroom discipline in Ofsted inspections.\n\nBalls claimed that the academies programme was 'driving radical transformation in weak and failing schools in disadvantaged communities' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1321). He went on:\n\nAll academies now actively collaborate with schools and colleges in their area, just as all schools should co-operate with academies. ...\n\nResults in academies are improving faster than they are in other schools. Truancy rates are down. Increasingly, inner-city local authorities such as Hackney, Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield are putting new academies at the centre of their local school strategies. The test of whether an organisation can be a potential sponsor should not be its bank balance, but whether it can demonstrate leadership, innovation, and commitment to act in the public interest; so, from today, I am abolishing the current requirement for universities and high-performing schools and colleges to provide £2 million before they can sponsor an academy. Many universities are already engaged with academies. I now want every university actively to engage with academies.\n\nIt is my belief that, as we move towards our target of 200 academies by 2010 - rising thereafter to 400 - we should accelerate the pace of the academies programme over the next few years, with a much greater role for universities (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1321-22).\n\nBalls said his Department could not bear the whole burden of improving the life chances of all children. The government therefore intended to draw up a Children's Plan, and would launch a nationwide consultation involving 'teachers, children's professionals, universities, colleges, the voluntary sector, parents, and children and young people' (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1323).\n\nIt was 'a challenging agenda', he said, but getting it right was 'critical to the future of our country':\n\nEvery child has talent, and through the measures that I have set out today and the consultation that we will now begin, we will ensure that every child gets the best start in life and the support they need to make the most of their talents (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1323).\n\nIn his reply, Michael Gove said:\n\nFirst, may I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his appointment? During his brief period on the Back Benches, he campaigned vigorously on child poverty and helped to secure improved respite care for the parents of disabled children. I place on record our admiration for that work, and express the hope that we can continue to work with him on those issues in a constructive, bipartisan way. May I also welcome what I take to be the good intentions that he brings to his office? Specifically, I welcome his commitment to use 'all the levers' at his disposal to strengthen family life. ...\n\nI also applaud the Secretary of State's new commitment to excellence, diversity and discipline in our schools, which is another embrace of Conservative policy. However, that prompts the inevitable question why, after 10 years of a Prime Minister who promised a relentless focus on 'Education, education, education', is such an ambitious agenda still required? (Hansard House of Commons 10 July 2007 Col 1324).\n\nIn the autumn of 2007 the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, announced the three-year settlement for education. A 2.8 per cent real-terms annual increase to £74bn in 2010 was higher than that for other departments but lower than in previous years. Teachers' leaders noted that the budget for each pupil would rise from £5,500 in 2007-8 to £6,600 in 2010-11, but pointed out that this was still far short of the cost of a private-school education. Darling also promised £250m to fund the Children's Plan scheme to make sure children arrived at school ready to learn and able to benefit from personalised support (The Guardian 10 October 2007).\n\nIn his first major speech on education, Gordon Brown told an audience of educationists at Greenwich University that 'failing' schools would have five years to improve their pupils' GCSE results or they would face take-over or closure. He set out wide-ranging plans to expand childcare, eradicate illiteracy and introduce more work-based apprenticeships to persuade more 16-year-olds to stay on in education. 'This is a determined and systematic agenda to end failure', he said. 'We will see it through. We will not flinch from the task' (The Guardian 1 November 2007).\n\nConservative policies\n\nA few days after Brown's speech, Conservative leader David Cameron (pictured) launched his party's education policy paper, Raising the bar, closing the gap.\n\nDescribed as 'an action plan for schools', it declared that a Conservative government would revolutionise education by supporting the creation of a new generation of academies, which would be\n\nfree, non-selective, and within the maintained system. They will typically be smaller than comparable, existing schools; they will be set up and run by existing educational providers, charities, trusts, voluntary groups, philanthropists and co-operatives on behalf of parents and pupils; they will be not-for-profit organisations and they will compete with surrounding local authority schools, helping to exert pressure for higher standards in the surrounding schools (Conservative Party 2007:36-37).\n\nWith regard to discipline in schools, the paper said:\n\nThe best approach to tackling poor discipline is to ensure that problems with the potential to escalate are dealt with immediately and that clear boundaries are set so that pupils recognise the absolute authority of teachers within the school. Sanctions against pupils who step outside these boundaries need to be instantly and consistently applied, ensuring that every pupil recognises the consequences of their actions (Conservative Party 2007:22).\n\nIt noted that 'top performing comprehensive schools' had\n\nstrict school uniform policies, with blazer, shirt and tie and with a zero-tolerance of incorrect or untidy dress;\n\nextensive extra-curricular activities, which take place after school or in the lunch break;\n\naround an hour for lunch (as opposed to 30 minutes in many weaker schools) - and generally they do not allow pupils to leave the school premises during the lunch break;\n\na system of prefects and a head boy and head girl; and\n\nthe opportunity to highlight and publicly reward achievement, both academic and sporting (Conservative Party 2007:31).\n\nThe policy paper stressed the importance of setting pupils by ability and claimed that Labour had failed to promote this strongly enough:\n\nLabour's 1997 manifesto acknowledged the importance of setting and implied that the amount of setting in schools would be increased significantly. This has not taken place. In 1997 37 per cent of academic lessons were set by ability, rising to just 40 per cent by 2006. In some subjects, such as history and geography, nearly three-quarters of lessons take place in mixed ability classes (Conservative Party 2007:32).\n\nMixed-ability teaching, the Conservatives argued, had failed because teachers invariably taught to 'just below the average ability of the class',\n\nthus boring the most able children and baffling the least able. This can often lead to disruption, truancy and disengagement (Conservative Party 2007:32).\n\nFinally, a 'Pupil Premium' to increase per capita funding for 'pupils from deprived backgrounds' would result in schools being 'incentivised to seek out and accept pupils from more challenging backgrounds' (Conservative Party 2007:42).\n\nAt a conference in Brighton College in May 2008, Michael Gove told teachers that a Conservative government would reinstate traditional fact-based lessons. Generations of children had been let down by so-called progressive education policies which had taught skills and 'empathy' instead of bodies of knowledge, he said (The Guardian 9 May 2008).\n\nHe condemned the 'pupil-centred learning' theories which had gained support in the 1960s for 'dethroning' the teacher:\n\nIt is an approach to education that has been called progressive, but in fact is anything but. It privileges temporary relevance over a permanent body of knowledge which should be passed on from generation to generation ... We need to tackle this misplaced ideology wherever it occurs (quoted in The Guardian 9 May 2008).\n\nChristine Blower, Acting General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said\n\nGove's attack on child-centred learning is an absurd caricature of reality ... If there has been a dethroning of teachers, it has been because successive politicians have decided that they know better than teachers about how children learn (quoted in The Guardian 9 May 2008).\n\nThe Children's Plan\n\nThe central feature of the Brown government's education policy was The Children's Plan. Building on the Every child matters agenda of Tony Blair's second administration, and based on widespread consultations involving children, young people, parents, teachers and policy makers, the Plan was designed to underpin and inform all future government policy relating to children, their families and schools. It aimed to eradicate child poverty and significantly reduce illiteracy and antisocial behaviour by 2020.\n\nThe Plan attempted to address a series of highly critical reports on British childhood by Unicef and others, and to demonstrate evidence of Gordon Brown's much talked-of 'vision'.\n\nBuilding brighter futures\n\nThe Children's Plan was launched in December 2007 with the publication of Building brighter futures.\n\nIn his Foreword, Ed Balls wrote that he wanted to make Britain 'the best place in the world for our children and young people to grow up' (DCSF 2007c:3).\n\nThe Plan was based on five principles:\n\ngovernment does not bring up children - parents do - so government needs to do more to back parents and families;\n\nall children have the potential to succeed and should go as far as their talents can take them;\n\nchildren and young people need to enjoy their childhood as well as grow up prepared for adult life;\n\nservices need to be shaped by and responsive to children, young people and families, not designed around professional boundaries; and\n\nit is always better to prevent failure than tackle a crisis later (DCSF 2007c:5-6).\n\nIt set ten goals to be achieved by 2020:\n\nenhance children and young people's well-being, particularly at key transition points in their lives;\n\nevery child ready for success in school, with at least 90 per cent developing well across all areas of the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile by age 5;\n\nevery child ready for secondary school, with at least 90 per cent achieving at or above the expected level in both English and mathematics by age 11;\n\nevery young person with the skills for adult life and further study, with at least 90 per cent achieving the equivalent of five higher level GCSEs by age 19; and at least 70 per cent achieving the equivalent of two A levels by age 19;\n\nparents satisfied with the information and support they receive;\n\nall young people participating in positive activities to develop personal and social skills, promote well-being and reduce behaviour that puts them at risk;\n\nemployers satisfied with young people's readiness for work;\n\nchild health improved, with the proportion of obese and overweight children reduced to 2000 levels;\n\nchild poverty halved by 2010 and eradicated by 2020; and\n\nsignificantly reduce by 2020 the number of young offenders receiving a conviction, reprimand, or final warning for a recordable offence for the first time, with a goal to be set in the Youth Crime Action Plan (DCSF 2007c:14).\n\nThousands of playgrounds would be created or refurbished (DCSF 2007c:6-7); personal tutors and one-to-one classes would give struggling pupils a chance to catch up (DCSF 2007c:8-9); there would be 'a root and branch review of the primary curriculum' led by Sir Jim Rose (DCSF 2007c:9); and teaching would be made 'a Masters level profession' (DCSF 2007c:10).\n\nAll new schools would be carbon-neutral by 2016 (DCSF 2007c:11); £60m would be spent on improving youth facilities (DCSF 2007c:12); and there would be more 20mph speed limit zones near schools (DCSF 2007c:39).\n\nA dozen strategy reviews - on areas including drugs and alcohol, sex education, bullying, and the commercialisation of childhood - would determine how the targets were to be met.\n\nReaction\n\nChildren's campaigners welcomed the plan.\n\nBob Reitemeier, Chief Executive of the Children's Society, said:\n\nThe responsibility for childhood rests with us all and we are encouraged that the children's plan looks beyond education to address fundamental areas such as parents and play (quoted in The Guardian 12 December 2007).\n\nAnd Child Poverty Action Group Chief Executive Kate Green commented:\n\nThe common thread that will transform the plan's patchwork of measures into a successful whole is an end to child poverty ... It is now up to the Treasury to make sure that ... the child poverty target is met so that the children's plan is not undermined (quoted in The Guardian 12 December 2007).\n\nTeachers were generally supportive of the plan, though some were concerned about the scale of the reforms which schools were being asked to lead. John Dunford, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the plan would make 'massive demands on schools' which would need the support of the full range of public services. He went on:\n\nIf schools are to be placed at the core of social reform for children, as the breadth of the children's plan suggests, this places tremendous expectations on schools and their leaders (quoted in The Guardian 12 December 2007).\n\n21st Century Schools: A World-Class Education for Every Child\n\nBuilding brighter futures was followed, in December 2008, by the consultation document 21st Century Schools: A World-Class Education for Every Child.\n\nThe school system of the 21st century, it said, would need to ensure that children and young people were 'fully engaged with their education until at least the age of 18, reach world-class standards and acquire skills, understanding and qualifications that will serve them well in the future' (DCSF 2008d:5). They would need to learn 'in an environment of good behaviour' in which they were 'not bullied or discriminated against', and could 'develop the wider personal skills, characteristics and attitudes they need to succeed and make a positive contribution to society, while enjoying a fulfilling and healthy childhood' (DCSF 2008d:6).\n\nYoung people's additional needs (including special educational needs) would be met as early as possible so that they were not 'distracted or disengaged from learning' (DCSF 2008d:6); and there would be 'high levels of parental engagement and satisfaction with schools' (DCSF 2008d:6).\n\nSchools would 'work more extensively and effectively with parents, other providers and wider children's services' (DCSF 2008d:7); and the government would develop 'an accountability framework and school improvement strategies for all schools, underpinned by the new School Report Card' (DCSF 2008d:8).\n\nBreaking the Link\n\nIn 2009 DCSF published the first of what was planned to be a series of documents aimed at breaking the link between children's circumstances and their achievements. In the event, only two were published:\n\nBreaking the Link between disadvantage and low attainment (2009); and\n\nBreaking the Link between special educational needs and low attainment (2010).\n\nLegislation\n\nThere were three major education acts in this period, though the third was much reduced in scope because of the impending general election:\n\n2008 Education and Skills Act;\n\n2009 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act;\n\n2010 Children, Schools and Families Act.\n\n2008 Education and Skills Act\n\nEducation and Skills Bill\n\nThe Education and Skills Bill, published on 29 November 2007, was jointly sponsored by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills.\n\nPresenting the bill for its second reading in the House of Lords on 10 June 2008, Lord Adonis said:\n\nThe Bill legislates in five main areas to improve education and skills. First, it will make it compulsory by 2015 for all young people to participate in some form of education or training, at least part time, until they are 18 years old. Secondly, it will make various provisions to encourage, enable and assist young people's participation. Thirdly, it will give adults certain rights to expect skills training and enable analysis to take place of the quality and value of such training. Fourthly, it will make a number of changes to the inspection and regulatory regime for independent schools and non-maintained special schools. Fifthly, it will help to ensure a fair and transparent admissions system to schools both pre- and post-16.\n\nThe most significant provisions raise the education and training leaving age to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. The Bill's first clause places on all young people resident in England a responsibility to participate in education or training up to their 18th birthday from those dates, provided that they have not first achieved a level 3 qualification (Hansard House of Lords 10 June 2008 Cols 489-490).\n\nSummary of the Act\n\nThe 2008 Education and Skills Act (26 November) was in five parts, of which the first three dealt with the raising of the education leaving age to 18.\n\nPart 1 Chapter 1 required young people to participate in education or training until their 18th birthday through\n\nfull-time education or training, including school, college or home education;\n\nwork-based learning, such as an Apprenticeship; or\n\npart-time education or training for those working more than 20 hours a week (Sections 1-9).\n\nChapter 2 set out the role of local education authorities and educational institutions in promoting the fulfilment of this duty; Chapter 3, the duty on employers to enable participation. Chapter 4 made provisions regarding parenting contracts and parenting orders; Chapter 5 dealt with attendance notices. Miscellaneous matters were covered in Chapter 6.\n\nPart 2 concerned the provision of support services for young adults with learning difficulties and young people in general. It empowered local authorities to arrange learning difficulty assessments for students in their final year of compulsory education and for any young person up to the age of 25 who would benefit from an assessment (Section 80); and set out arrangements for careers advice (81), apprenticeships (82) and transport (83).\n\nIn Part 3, Section 86 dealt with adult skills including:\n\nthe learning aims for persons age 19;\n\nthe duty of the Learning and Skills Council to ensure the free provision of basic skills and first level 2 qualification courses; and\n\nthe duty of the Learning and Skills Council to ensure that 19 to 25 year olds undertaking their first full level 3 qualification (equivalent to two GCSE A levels) did not have to pay tuition fees.\n\nPart 4 rationalised the regulation and monitoring regime for independent schools and non-maintained special schools.\n\nPart 5 covered a variety of miscellaneous and general matters, including:\n\nthe right of young people to express a preference for sixth-form education and to appeal against any decision made (150);\n\nschool admission arrangements (151);\n\nthe powers of governing bodies in relation to the improvement of pupil behaviour (154);\n\nthe duty of governors and heads to implement National Curriculum assessment arrangements (156);\n\ninspections of teacher training in England without prior notification (164); and\n\nthe duty of school governing bodies to consider the views of pupils on policy matters affecting them (157).\n\n2009 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act\n\nApprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill\n\nThe Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill was published on 4 February 2009. At its second reading in the Commons on 23 February, Ed Balls began by noting that the number of secondary schools 'below the basic benchmark' was now only 440, but said he wanted to go further:\n\nThe Bill challenges local authorities to tackle underperforming schools, but it also gives us the power, where they will not act, to step in and require them to take their responsibilities seriously. We will do so by requiring them to match new investment with new leadership through national challenge trusts and our academies programme (Hansard House of Commons 23 February 2009 Col 26).\n\nThe Bill also aimed to help schools improve behaviour and discipline: 'we are extending the powers that we have given school and college staff to search a pupil for weapons so that they may search also for drugs, alcohol and stolen property' (Hansard House of Commons 23 February 2009 Col 28).\n\nOn apprenticeships, Balls said that the bill represented 'the first overhaul of apprenticeship legislation for nearly 200 years':\n\nIt will put apprenticeships on a statutory basis, and establish the entitlement to an apprenticeship place for every suitably qualified young person who wants one. It will ensure that apprenticeships are of high quality, and that they will benefit young people and employers alike. It will also require schools to provide information, advice and guidance on apprenticeships, when it is in the best interest of pupils to do so. We are backing this with a £1 billion plan (Hansard House of Commons 23 February 2009 Col 32).\n\nReaction\n\nWriting in The Guardian (2 June 2009), Warwick Mansell noted that the bill gave Ed Balls and John Denham 153 new powers:\n\nThe bill gives the secretary of state the right to define, for example, the content of certificates for apprenticeships; to stipulate which courses, other than maths, English and ICT [information and communications technology], students aged 16 to 19 should be entitled to study; to direct a local authority to 'provide information about accountable resources held, received or expended' by its schools; to specify the maximum amount of compensation that an employee is entitled to should his or her employer be found by an employment tribunal to have illegally denied him or her the right to training; to require a local authority to produce a revised statement on its transport plans for sixth-formers following a complaint; and, strangely, to stipulate, for qualifications for young people aged 19 or over, the minimum level of attainment in literacy and numeracy needed 'to operate effectively in day-to-day life' (Mansell 2009a).\n\n'Is this the most centralising education bill in history?' asked Mansell. Under the 1944 Education Act the Minister of Education had had just three central duties: 'to promote the education of the people of England and Wales'; 'to promote the progressive development of schools and colleges'; and 'to secure that local authorities execute the national policy for providing a very comprehensive educational service' (Mansell 2009a).\n\nBut in the last twenty years there had been 'a steady growth in the powers of central government', with the introduction of the National Curriculum, National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, and the targets and league table regime, 'all overseen and directed by ministers and civil servants' (Mansell 2009a).\n\nBarry Sheerman, Labour chair of the House of Commons Children, Schools and Families Committee, commented:\n\nThere does seem to be a general feeling out there, in the evidence the committee has received on several inquiries, of people desiring a swing back towards local autonomy. Ministers need to understand this before they continue plodding on in the opposite direction (quoted in The Guardian 2 June 2009).\n\nAnd John Fowler, a consultant for the Local Government Information Unit, added: 'If the government was really serious about devolving power, it would just scrap this bill and start again. I cannot see that happening' (quoted in The Guardian 2 June 2009).\n\nSummary of the Act\n\nThe 2009 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act (12 November) was huge. Its 265 pages contained thirteen parts dealing with:\n\nPart 1 Apprenticeships, study and training: created a statutory framework for apprenticeships and a right to an apprenticeship for suitably qualified 16-18 year olds (Sections 1-39); it set out the duties of employers to facilitate such training (40).\n\nPart 2 LEA functions: local education authorities in England were required to 'secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of -\n\n(a) persons in their area who are over compulsory school age but under 19, and\n\n(b) persons in their area who are aged 19 or over but under 25 and are subject to learning difficulty assessment' (41).\n\nSections 48-52 made provisions with respect to the education of young offenders.\n\nPart 3 The Young People's Learning Agency for England: provided for the establishment of the Agency (60) and set out its functions and funding arrangements (61-80).\n\nPart 4 The Chief Executive of Skills Funding: to be appointed by the Secretary of State (80). Sections 82-121 set out the duties of the post.\n\nPart 5 Supplementary matters relating to Parts 2 to 4: the abolition of the Learning and Skills Council (123-124).\n\nPart 6 The sixth form college sector: local authorities were to be prohibited from establishing new sixth-form colleges (125-126).\n\nPart 7 The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation: the Act provided for the creation of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, to be known as Ofqual (127); and set out its objectives and duties (128-131) and its functions in relation to qualifications (132-158), assessment arrangements connected with the National Curriculum (159), and the Early Years Foundation Stage (160).\n\nPart 8 The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency: the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority was to be renamed the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (175). Its objective was 'to promote quality and coherence in education and training in England' (176). The Authority's functions in relation to qualifications, the curriculum, the Early Years Foundation Stage and assessment arrangements were to include providing advice to the Secretary of State and conducting programmes of research and development (178-192).\n\nPart 9 Children's services: set out arrangements for promoting co-operation to improve the well-being of children, including the establishment of Children's Trust Boards (194), targets for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children (195), and arrangements for children's centres (198-202).\n\nPart 10 Schools: amended local education authorities' powers to intervene in schools which were causing concern (203-205); laid down new rules regarding the investigation of complaints against schools by parents or pupils (206-224); changed the arrangements for school inspections (225-226); and provided for the creation of a School Support Staff Negotiating Body (227-241).\n\nPart 11 Learners: amended previous Acts to give members of staff the power to search pupils in schools and students in further and higher education for prohibited items (242-245); changed the rules about recording and reporting the use of force in schools and in further and higher education institutions (246-247); set out arrangements for school behaviour and attendance partnerships (248); and changed the name of pupil referral units to short-stay schools (249)\n\nThe remainder of the Act (Parts 12 and 13) dealt with various miscellaneous and general matters.\n\n2010 Children, Schools and Families Act\n\n2009 White Paper: Your child, your schools, our future\n\nBefore the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act had received the Royal Assent, the government published its next education White Paper, in June 2009. Your child, your schools, our future was to form the basis for the Children, Schools and Families Bill, which was intended to become the 2010 Children, Schools and Families Act, though most of it would be lost in the run-up to the general election.\n\nThe White Paper signalled the abandonment of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, though the government would\n\nstill expect every primary school to be teaching daily 'literacy hours' and daily mathematics lessons (DCSF 2009d:9).\n\nIn his Foreword, Ed Balls wrote that:\n\nwe can now take the historic step of setting out in law our new Pupil and Parent Guarantees. For each young person, this will mean a school where:\n\nthere is good behaviour, strong discipline, order and safety;\n\nthey are taught a broad, balanced and flexible curriculum including skills for learning and life;\n\nthey are taught in a way that meets their needs, where their progress is regularly checked and where additional needs are spotted early and addressed quickly;\n\nthey take part in sport and cultural activities;\n\ntheir health and wellbeing is supported; and\n\nthey have the chance to express their views, and they and their families are welcomed and valued (DCSF 2009d:3-4).\n\nThe White Paper's key points were that:\n\nschools would have more freedom and would be enabled to establish networks of school-to-school support to help drive up standards (DCSF 2009d:23);\n\nthere should be a pupil guarantee setting out new entitlements to personalised support for every child, matched by a parent guarantee for every parent (DCSF 2009d:25);\n\nall schools should have good behaviour, strong discipline, order and safety (DCSF 2009d:26);\n\nparents of children who regularly behaved badly in class could face court-imposed parenting orders (DCSF 2009d:27);\n\nschools should be given greater flexibility and encouraged to innovate (DCSF 2009d:28);\n\nschools should work in partnership with other schools and with wider children's services (DCSF 2009d:43);\n\nlocal consortia should offer a choice of every one of the new diplomas to 14-19 year-olds (DCSF 2009d:44);\n\nthere should be more academies and trust schools (DCSF 2009d:44);\n\npartnerships of primary schools would share specialist teaching (DCSF 2009d:46);\n\na system would be developed for accrediting good education providers who wished to run groups of schools (DCSF 2009d:48);\n\nthere would be strong accountability and rapid intervention to improve schools when needed (DCSF 2009d:55);\n\nthe role of 'School Improvement Partners' (SIPs) would be expanded (DCSF 2009d:55);\n\nthere would be a new School Report Card (SRC) (DCSF 2009d:55);\n\nthe use of the private consultants employed to improve schools would be cut (DCSF 2009d:60)\n\nthe relationship between central government, local authorities and schools would be improved (DCSF 2009d:66);\n\nthere would be a new Masters degree in Teaching and Learning (DCSF 2009d:84);\n\nthere should be better development of support staff (DCSF 2009d:84); and\n\ngoverning bodies' fundamental duties to children, young people and the wider community would be enshrined in law (DCSF 2009d:84).\n\nChildren, Schools and Families Bill\n\nThese proposals formed the basis of the Children, Schools and Families Bill, published on 19 November 2009.\n\nThe Bill's provisions regarding sex education caused problems for the government. Ministers had announced in October 2008 that sex education would be made a compulsory part of the National Curriculum in primary and secondary schools. Schools would not be allowed to opt out, and faith schools would be given guidance on how to provide sex and relationship education - to include contraception, abortion and homosexuality - alongside conflicting religious beliefs (The Guardian 24 October 2008).\n\nBut religious groups objected, and the new regulations, which were due to come into effect in September 2011, were amended. All schools would still be required to teach sex education, but the government now said that parents could withdraw children under 15 from the lessons, which would only be compulsory for 15- and 16-year-olds (The Guardian 5 November 2009).\n\nThis was still not enough for the Catholic Education Service, which lobbied the government to make further changes. Ministers backed down and agreed that sex and relationships education (SRE) could reflect a school's religious character.\n\nCritics argued that this would allow faith schools to discourage the use of contraception and teach that homosexuality was wrong. The Accord Coalition, a newly-formed group of Hindu, Christian and Humanist organisations campaigning to stop state-funded schools from discriminating against students and teachers on the grounds of religion, accused Balls of implicitly condoning homophobia in schools and undermining his own attempts to tackle homophobic bullying.\n\nChair of Accord, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain said:\n\nIt is astonishing that the government plans to deny young people of their right to accurate, balanced SRE ... Children at faith schools have just as much right to information that could help them avoid an unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection (quoted in The Guardian 18 February 2010).\n\nA DCSF spokesman dismissed the complaints:\n\nAll maintained schools will be required to teach full programmes of study in line with the principles outlined in the bill, including promoting equality and encouraging acceptance of diversity. Schools with a religious character will be free to express their faith and reflect the ethos of their school, but what they cannot do is suggest that their views are the only ones (quoted inThe Guardian 18 February 2010).\n\nA Catholic school would thus be required to teach children the facts about contraception, but would be allowed to try to persuade them that its use was immoral.\n\nBalls insisted that the amendment would not dilute the bill: it would still require state schools to teach pupils about the importance of stable relationships, including civil partnerships, and it would forbid the promotion of homophobia.\n\nDespite the concerns, the amendment was passed by 268 votes to 177 without debate, because of a lack of time at the report stage on 23 February 2010. Liberal Democrat schools spokesman David Laws told the Commons:\n\nI am very sad about the change that the Government have made regarding sex and relationship education, which did not come out of any pressure in Committee. I do not believe that even the Conservative party, which has traditionally been cautious about such issues, proposed to amend the legislation in that way. Now, we have this amendment that we have not had the opportunity to debate today and that cuts directly across the commitment in the Bill to promote equality and diversity (Hansard House of Commons 23 February 2010 Col 264).\n\nAlison Ryan, education policy adviser of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said\n\nWe believe this amendment is unhelpful and unnecessary because it upsets the balance of the Bill by placing the religious character of the school above the promotion of equality and tolerance of diversity (quoted in The Guardian 24 February 2010).\n\nAnd National Secular Society Executive Director Keith Porteous Wood complained that the government had 'once more bowed to pressure from the Catholic Church, betraying the children in faith schools who have a right to objective and balanced sex education' (quoted in The Guardian 24 February 2010).\n\nIn an editorial, The Guardian commented:\n\nThis looks like a case of the government being led away from the path of righteousness by ecclesiastical lobbying, which has happened several times before. There was, for instance, the climbdown over the plan to force faith schools to take some children from outside their own flock. There was also section 37 of the 2008 Education Act, which undercut Labour's solid record on discrimination at work by allowing schools to hand-pick staff on the basis of their creed. Many devout people - and many believers in faith schools - are represented by the Accord Coalition, which argues that no state-funded institution should be exempted from norms that all other public bodies must follow. Unless all religious schools are required to see the light, the contradictions will become unsustainable. The recurring pattern of church lobbying and Whitehall climbdowns is testing society's faith in church schools as being a force for good (The Guardian 24 February 2010).\n\nIn the event, none of this mattered because, with a general election just a month away, all the sex education provisions in the bill - and most of the others - were lost.\n\nSummary of the Act\n\nThe 2010 Children, Schools and Families Act (8 April) was in three parts:\n\nPart 1 made provisions concerning children with special educational needs, exceptional provision for ill or excluded children, the powers of governing bodies, and Local Safeguarding Children Boards.\n\nPart 2 dealt with proceedings in family courts.\n\nPart 3 made minor amendments to the 2009 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act and the 2008 Education and Skills Act.\n\nOther Acts\n\n2007 Further Education and Training Act\n\nThe 2007 Further Education and Training Act (23 October) made provisions about:\n\nthe Learning and Skills Council for England (Sections 1-13);\n\ninstitutions within the further education sector (14-23), including their power to award foundation degrees (19);\n\nindustrial training levies (24-25);\n\nthe formation of, and investment in, companies and charitable incorporated organisations by higher education corporations (26); and\n\nthe powers of the Welsh Assembly in relation to education (27).\n\n2008 Sale of Student Loans Act\n\nThe 2008 Sale of Student Loans Act (21 July) allowed the government to sell student loans to a third party, and set out the regulations regarding such sales.\n\n2008 Special Educational Needs (Information) Act\n\nThe 2008 Special Educational Needs (Information) Act (21 July) amended the 1996 Education Act in relation to the provision and publication of information, with the purpose of 'improving the well-being of children in England with special educational needs' (Section 1).\n\n2008 Children and Young Persons Act\n\nThe provisions of the 2008 Children and Young Persons Act (13 November) concerned:\n\nthe delivery of local authority social work services for children and young persons (Sections 1-6);\n\nthe functions of local authorities and others in relation to children and young persons (7-33), including the enforcement of care standards in children's homes; and\n\nthe independent review of determinations relating to adoption (34).\n\n2010 Child Poverty Act\n\nThe 2010 Child Poverty Act (25 March):\n\nset targets relating to the eradication of child poverty (Sections 1-7): the target for the year beginning 1 April 2010 was that no more than 1.7m children should be living in homes classified as poor (1(2));\n\nestablished the Child Poverty Commission (8);\n\nset out the duties of local authorities and others in relation to child poverty (19-25); and\n\nmade minor amendments to the 1996 Education Act relating to free school lunches and milk (26).\n\n2010 Equality Act\n\nThe 2010 Equality Act (8 April) was huge and wide-ranging (239 pages containing 218 Sections and 28 Schedules). It replaced nine major Acts and almost one hundred sets of regulations which had been issued over several decades.\n\nEducation was dealt with in Part 6 of the Act, which comprised chapters relating to schools, further and higher education institutions, and qualfications bodies.\n\nSchools\n\nBuilding Schools for the Future\n\nOn 9 August 2007 the Commons Education and Skills Committee (CESC) published its report on the early stages of Building Schools for the Future (BSF), which it described as 'an immensely ambitious programme designed to rebuild or refurbish all secondary schools in England over 15 years at a cost of £45 billion' (CESC 2007b:3).\n\nSustainable Schools: Are we building schools for the future? argued that:\n\nlocal authorities needed more time to consider what they wanted of their schools - 'the difficulties faced by earliest waves of authorities in coping with deadlines suggest that this would be time well spent' (CESC 2007b:3);\n\nthere were risks associated with the public finance initiative (PFI) scheme, which had been used for about half the new projects. Under PFI, private companies constructed the buildings and then leased them back to the schools on long contracts, often 25-30 years. The government, said the Committee, 'needs to set out more clearly than it has done so far its assessment of the sustainability of the levels of revenue commitments across local authorities in general' (CESC 2007b:3);\n\nthe government should 'have the courage of its convictions, and allow local authorities greater flexibility to develop local solutions within a clear framework of priorities, such as the need to promote innovative approaches to learning and the need to embed sustainability' (CESC 2007b:4);\n\nthe scheme should be regularly reviewed and questioned - it was 'vitally important lessons are learned from the earliest schools and projects in the process' (CESC 2007b:4);\n\nwithin a basic framework, local authorities 'should be given more freedom to shape their local school system as they consider appropriate' (CESC 2007b:6).\n\nThe Committee was anxious about the environmental impact of the programme:\n\nThe schools estate contributes 2% to national carbon emissions overall, but that figure represents almost 15% of UK public sector carbon emissions. If the Government is to meet a target of at least 60% reduction against the 1990 baseline, and if it intends to set an example by the way in which it looks after the public sector building stock, it clearly has to address the issue of schools' carbon emissions (CESC 2007b:5).\n\nAs to the cost of the programme, the Committee said:\n\nWe are not arguing that BSF is a waste of money or that it should not proceed. Indeed it represents an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that all of the physical spaces which pupils occupy effectively support their learning. What we are saying is that, given the scale of the project and the amount of money proposed to be spent, there is a danger that everyone involved will concentrate on getting through to the end and that the question of whether the project's scope and aims remain appropriate will not be asked (CESC 2007b:5).\n\nIn October 2007 Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that every local authority would get a new or refurbished primary school. A £200m fund would pay for building work for 75 schools by 2011, doubling the planned primary-school building programme over the next three years (The Guardian 10 October 2007).\n\nIn the first four years of the BSF programme, local authorities had struggled to set up the PFI partnerships which provided most of the funding, so in April 2008 ministers announced that the aim would now be to build just four new schools in each local authority area. A DCSF spokesman said there were still 'ambitions' for every school to have a plan in place, even if building work had not started by 2020 (The Guardian 10 April 2008).\n\nAn audit conducted by the government's architecture watchdog, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), suggested that four out of five designs for secondary schools proposed under the BSF initiative were 'mediocre' or 'not yet good enough' and only one in five were considered to be 'good' or 'excellent'. Problems identified in the forty proposed designs which were reviewed by CABE included bullying hotspots in secluded yards, noisy open-plan areas which made teaching difficult, and classrooms which were too dark or prone to overheating on sunny afternoons (The Guardian 21 July 2008).\n\nAcademies and trust schools\n\nAs Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown had said virtually nothing about the academies programme until three months before Tony Blair resigned when, in his first public pronouncement on the subject, he had praised the 'tremendous success of the academy movement' (The Guardian 20 March 2007). As Prime Minister, however, he seemed content to preside over the expansion of the programme, despite continuing problems and controversies.\n\nMeanwhile, struggling private schools decided that becoming academies was the answer to their financial difficulties. By August 2007 four were already changing status, two more had applied and twenty were said to be interested. Other private schools were considering sponsorship of academies: Anthony Seldon, head of Wellington College, argued that this would help end Britain's 'educational apartheid' (The Guardian 4 August 2007).\n\nCPAC Report: The Academies programme\n\nIn its report, The Academies programme, published on 18 October 2007, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (CPAC) noted routine overspending in the building of academies.\n\nThe Committee's main findings were that:\n\nexisting academies had made progress, for example in raising pupils' attainment at GCSE, but it was too early to tell whether rising attainment was sustainable;\n\nliteracy and numeracy of academy pupils had risen but were still low, at less than half the level of attainment in all secondary schools;\n\nmany academy sixth forms were small, which restricted the range of subjects they could offer. They should collaborate with neighbouring schools, colleges, other training providers and employers, to broaden the curriculum and give young people beyond the age of 16 a wide range of educational options;\n\na small number of academies had had high levels of exclusions, possibly as part of a short-term strategy to improve pupil behaviour. The Department should scrutinise trends in individual academies' exclusions to assess whether exclusions rates were reducing to be more in line with similar schools;\n\nof the first 26 academy buildings, 17 had incurred cost overruns averaging £3.2m, or well over 10 per cent. The Department did not yet know the costs of running academies in the longer term;\n\na small number of academies had paid sponsors to provide services which should have been put out to competitive tender, so as to meet existing procurement regulations and avoid conflicts of interest;\n\nthere were fewer planned or open academies than might have been expected in the north of England. The Department's target was that 60 of the first 200 academies should be in London. It should examine deprivation data when deciding the location of a new academy to make sure that its programme for academies reflected the Government's overriding objective to raise attainment in deprived areas, and that academies were built in areas with the greatest need;\n\nacademies were 'a relatively costly means of tackling low attainment'. The Department should reject proposals that put at risk the viability of local schools and colleges providing a good quality education, including proposals relating to education from age 16. It should not approve academy projects in locations where a less costly solution, for example requiring less capital expenditure and lower or no start-up funds, would provide better value for money;\n\nfollowing changes announced in the Budget of March 2007, academies should make their facilities available for use by their communities, and the Department should consider whether there would be a future need to address this issue in relation to voluntary-aided schools being rebuilt as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme; and\n\nthere should be more systematic sharing of lessons learnt from the first academy projects (CPAC 2007:5-6).\n\nOngoing problems\n\nBy December 2007, twenty-one universities had been persuaded by ministers to adopt academies, but Oxford and Cambridge rejected the idea. At Cambridge there were concerns about potential conflicts of interest in admissions; while at Oxford, a spokesperson told The Guardian that the university was working with schools in 56 local authorities and strongly supported raising aspirations for all young people. 'We would be reluctant to be formally associated with a single school', he said (The Guardian 3 December 2007).\n\nArms company BAE Systems, which was under criminal investigation in Britain, the US and Europe over corruption allegations, offered £400,000 to sponsor an academy in Barrow-in-Furness, where it built nuclear submarines. The proposal was opposed by local parents (The Guardian 11 December 2007).\n\nMajor changes at the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) saw its forty-strong council replaced with a new board of twelve directors; and Sir Cyril Taylor, who had chaired the Trust for twenty years, replaced by Sir James Hill, chair of governors of a Bradford academy. Taylor had been a favoured adviser to both Tory and Labour governments: under Tony Blair, he and Andrew (Lord) Adonis had promoted the academies programme, and his removal from SSAT was seen as a sign that the influence of Adonis was waning (The Guardian 20 December 2007). Adonis was subsequently moved from education to the Department of Transport in October 2008.\n\nBy the start of 2008, the government was running into difficulties finding enough sponsors for academies. Ed Balls had already exempted some universities, colleges and schools from raising the £2m fee to sponsor an academy; now, the government announced that it would pay successful state schools up to £300,000 to sponsor academies or set up new 'trust schools'. Thirty-four schools had already become trusts and 307 were working towards trust status (The Guardian 16 January 2008).\n\nMeanwhile, the Church of England announced plans to convert some existing cathedral schools into academies. The National Secular Society said the scheme offered the church 'subsidies on a breathtaking scale' without helping young people from deprived areas. Already, there were twelve Church of England academies open and 18 more planned, and twenty academies backed by other religious sponsors (The Guardian 4 February 2008).\n\nAdonis saw academies as the new generation's grammar schools, offering disadvantaged bright children a 'ladder' out of poverty. He said:\n\nMy vision is for academies to be in the vanguard of meritocracy for the next generation in the way that grammar schools were for a proportion of the post-war generation - providing a ladder, in particular, for less advantaged children to get on, and gain the very best education and qualifications, irrespective of wealth and family background, but without unfair selection at the age of 11 (quoted in The Guardian 8 February 2008).\n\nAnti-academy campaigners said that setting up 'quasi-grammar schools' would lead to a two-tier system of education (The Guardian 8 February 2008).\n\nIn a paper published by the Reform think-tank, Richard Tice, chair of Northampton Academy and board member of the United Learning Trust (ULT), the largest academy sponsor, said the government should make it easier for academies to exclude the worst-behaved pupils (they were already excluding ten times as many pupils as other state schools) and sack poorly-performing teachers. Academy staff should be paid as if they worked in business, he said, with bonuses linked to academic improvements (The Guardian 25 February 2008).\n\nEd Balls told Labour's spring conference in February 2008 that academies were 'turning round low-performing schools in disadvantaged communities'; that they had 'fair and comprehensive admissions' and 'even more disadvantaged intakes than their catchment areas'; and that they were 'delivering faster-rising results than other schools'. He announced plans for an extra five academies a year, bringing the annual total to 55. He said he believed that the changes he had made to the governance, curriculum requirements and sponsorship regime of academies would remove concerns that they were going to be selective and outside the local authority structure (The Guardian 29 February 2008).\n\nBut the programme came under renewed attack from the two largest teacher unions. At their annual conference in Birmingham, members of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) passed a motion to ballot members on industrial action in schools which were forced to become academies against the wishes of the staff. And Steve Sinnott, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said academies were compelling teachers to choose either to sign legal documents committing them to the 'values' of their new sponsors or to leave their jobs without compensation (The Guardian 26 March 2008).\n\nThe government announced 115 new trust schools, including the first 'co-operative' trust school, in Stockport, Greater Manchester, where pupils, parents and teachers were to be involved in decision-making (The Guardian 10 April 2008).\n\nAs part of the Children's Plan, Balls commissioned an inquiry into the impact of the commercial world on children, including the government's own policy of encouraging schools to link up with businesses. It was to be led by David Buckingham, a professor at the University of London Institute of Education (ULIE) and a leading authority on children and the media (The Guardian 19 May 2008).\n\nAcademies were accused of poaching the best head teachers from neighbouring schools by offering them six-figure salaries. Ministers claimed that academies had almost doubled the proportion of their pupils getting five good GCSEs, but teacher unions said this had been at a cost to other state schools, which were helpless to compete against the high salaries paid by academies (The Guardian 9 June 2008).\n\nThe liberal think-tank CentreForum argued that the academies programme should be extended to 'failing' primary schools, a view supported by Andrew Adonis and another former education adviser to the Blair government, Conor Ryan (The Guardian 16 July 2008).\n\nFifty-one new academies opened in September 2008. Ministers claimed that academies had out-performed other schools in GCSE results but neglected to mention that, in nine of the first 36 academies, GCSE scores had declined (The Guardian 30 August 2008).\n\nAccording to research by insurance company Zurich, private schools were rejecting the government's attempts to encourage them to sponsor academies - just six per cent of independent schools had considered doing so (The Guardian 12 September 2008).\n\nPaul Prest, the head of a new academy in Sunderland, suspended forty pupils in the first two weeks of the autumn term in 2008. He said the zero-tolerance approach was crucial because pupils had repeatedly breached the rules. Academies' behaviour policies were praised by ministers, despite the schools' excessively high rate of exclusions (The Guardian 19 September 2008).\n\nAmey plc told the government it no longer wished to sponsor Middlesbrough's Unity City Academy (The Guardian 10 October 2008).\n\nThe City Academy Bristol, which the government had listed as one of its 'National Challenge' schools because of its poor performance, announced that it was proposing to open fee-charging branches in Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The plan was supported by Anthony Seldon, head of Wellington College, which was also planning to open a number of foreign branches. Ray Priest, the head teacher of the City Academy Bristol, said opening 'branded schools' overseas would help to establish his academy as a 'global educational establishment' (The Guardian 10 October 2008).\n\nAn independent inquiry into the academies programme by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), commissioned by the government, showed that results had improved markedly but that the proportion of pupils the schools took from the poorest homes had shrunk, supporting claims by critics that more able students were being selected to improve results. The inquiry raised doubts about the planned expansion of the programme and warned of shortages of heads and sponsors. Separate figures, obtained by the Liberal Democrats through a parliamentary question, revealed the extent of the drop in the number of pupils on free school meals in academies. In 2003, 45 per cent of academy pupils were eligible; by September 2008 the figure was just 29 per cent, a reduction of 16 per cent. Across England as a whole the proportion of pupils on free school meals had fallen by only 1.7 per cent (The Guardian 14 November 2008).\n\nThe PWC inquiry also suggested that some academies had used government funds to establish subsidiary companies and that the government was failing to account for the money private sponsors were allocated (The Guardian 28 November 2008).\n\nThe government ordered an inquiry into academy sponsor Edutrust Academies Charitable Trust (EACT), a multi-faith charity chaired by the businessman Lord Bhatia. EACT, it was alleged, had mishandled money awarded to open a string of academies across England. The DCSF launched an inquiry into concerns raised by the charity's former Chief Executive, whose contract was terminated days after he complained of irregularities in 'governance and financing' at the organisation (The Guardian 28 November 2008).\n\nLord Bhatia was forced to resign from the board of EACT after the inquiry found it had failed to comply with 'financial management requirements' and had 'inappropriate governance arrangements'. Ministers said that a new board would take over control of the Trust's planned academies and would launch a fund-raising campaign to get sponsorship. EACT was due to open eight of the 80 academies being launched in September 2009 (The Guardian 13 March 2009).\n\nOne of the government's newest academies, Richard Rose Central Academy in Carlisle, was forced to close for a day when demonstrations by pupils got out of hand. Staff threatened to strike over pay cuts, parents demanded an emergency Ofsted inspection, and Ofsted placed the school in special measures. Chief Executive Peter Noble and head teacher Mark Yearsley resigned. Noble had had no experience as a teacher: he had previously been a manager in the National Health Service (The Guardian 29 January 2009).\n\nSchools minister Jim Knight confirmed that the government would consider applications for academy status from private schools struggling to stave off closure. Anthony Seldon, head teacher of Wellington College, said becoming an academy would not be the 'move of choice' for many private schools, but it could be their only option. Teachers' leaders said it amounted to a 'bail-out' for failing private schools. Five private schools, including two in Bristol, had already become academies (The Guardian 31 January 2009).\n\nMeanwhile, parents and local communities continued to oppose academies:\n\nin Furness, parents raised a 6,000-signature petition against the imposition of an academy, four campaigners were elected to the district council, and the campaign group Our Schools Are Not for Sale was expected to win seats on the county council;\n\nin Northampton, plans to replace Unity College, a Church of England secondary school, with an academy were shelved for a year after parents presented a 1,000-signature petition against it;\n\nin Croydon, an advertisement for the role of principal of one of two academies planned for the borough was published before consultation meetings had taken place;\n\nin Durham, the county council and sponsors planned to open three new academies in 2012: there was strong local opposition and teachers considered industrial action; and\n\nthere was also strong opposition to academies in Derby, Dudley, Preston and Tamworth. Some sponsors withdrew (The Guardian 5 May 2009).\n\nBy August 2009, 130 academies had been opened at a cost of almost £5bn, 67 were due to open in the autumn term 2009, and a hundred more were planned for September 2010. The government told sponsors to expect cuts in funding: EACT warned that some of its small rural schools might have to close if spending was reduced (The Guardian 29 August 2009).\n\nAs the 67 new academies opened, Ed Balls said they were part of the biggest wave of new schools since the Victorian era, and he insisted that the government would reach its target of 400 academies (The Guardian 7 September 2009).\n\nBut, in a clear sign that ministers were becoming desperate to find sufficient sponsors, Balls announced that the government would abandon its policy of charging charities, businesses and individuals a £2m sponsorship fee to run the schools. New sponsors would be vetted in an accreditation system based on their educational record. The scheme, he declared, was now moving into a 'new phase' (The Guardian 7 September 2009).\n\nMary Bousted, General Secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, warned:\n\nThe case hasn't been made for academies. We have a target which will mean one in ten secondaries are academies and the jury is still out on whether academies work. Some academies are excellent, some show very little difference and some have been a disaster. It can be a dangerous experiment. If an academy goes wrong, that can be catastrophic for the pupils, parents, teachers and the whole community (The Guardian 7 September 2009).\n\nWaltheof School in Sheffield had not been a 'failing' school and had been described by Ofsted as making 'reasonable progress' in 2004. But it had been closed and replaced by Sheffield Park Academy, run by the largest academy sponsor, United Learning Trust (ULT), an Anglican charity chaired by former Conservative education minister Angela Rumbold, which also ran ten private schools. In July 2009 school inspectors rated Sheffield Park 'inadequate' in all categories. Other ULT academies were also causing concerns and, in November 2009, Balls banned ULT from taking on any new schools until it had driven up standards in the 17 it was already running (The Guardian 13 September, 5 November 2009).\n\nIn December 2009 Warwick Mansell reported that 13 of the 90 academies which were supposed to have been given private sponsorship money for capital building work had not yet received any. In total, sponsors had so far paid barely two-thirds of the £145m they had promised towards capital costs in the seven years since the first of England's 200 academies had opened. This was despite the fact that these financial commitments were written into the contracts academy sponsors had had to sign 'to gain control of decisions on the curriculum, staffing and assets of these quasi-independent institutions, funded mainly by taxpayers' (Mansell 2009b).\n\nStaff at Crest Boys' Academy in Neasden, north-west London, held a one-day strike in protest at the announcement that the school's sponsor, EACT, intended to sack seven teachers. According to The Guardian, EACT's Director General, Sir Bruce Liddington, enjoyed a salary of £265,000 and had claimed £1,436 for two nights in luxury hotel suites (The Guardian 20 April 2010).\n\nFaith schools\n\nIn 2007, a third of all state schools in England were run by religious groups, mostly the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. There were also 37 Jewish schools, seven Muslim, two Sikh, one Seventh Day Adventist and one Greek Orthodox school.\n\nFaith in the System\n\nConscious of growing public unease at the increasing number of religious schools, in September 2007 the DCSF published Faith in the System, a 'joint vision statement' in which the government and the providers of 'publicly-funded schools with a religious character' highlighted 'the very positive contribution' which the schools made as 'valuable, engaged partners in the school system and in their local communities and beyond' (DCSF 2007a:1).\n\nAt the same time, DCSF sought\n\nto dispel some of the common myths and misunderstandings around faith schools and to build a basis for greater understanding and dialogue within society (DCSF 2007a:1).\n\nThe government welcomed the contribution which faith schools made - 'both as a result of their historical role and now as key players in contributing to the more diverse school system with greater opportunities for parental choice that we seek' (DCSF 2007a:4).\n\nThe Government remains committed to supporting the establishment of new schools by a range of providers - including faith organisations - where local consultation has shown that this is what parents and the community want, and where this greater diversity will help to raise standards (DCSF 2007a:4).\n\nFor their part, the governors and staff of all schools were expected\n\nto meet their legal requirements to promote a positive attitude to diversity of faith, race and ethnicity through every aspect of every pupil's school experience. In particular, staff and governors will encourage pupils to respect their own and other faiths and beliefs in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony with those of other faiths and no faith (DCSF 2007a:7).\n\nOn the subject of school admissions, the document said:\n\nThe Government welcomes the wide support given by the faith school providers for the new admissions policies introduced in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and the new School Admissions Code, such as the prohibition of interviewing and other unfair criteria, and the encouragement of practices that will ensure that all schools contribute to fair access (DCSF 2007a:17).\n\nA further expansion of faith schools was envisaged:\n\nThe Government will work with local authorities as the commissioners of schools and school places in each area and with faith organisations to remove unnecessary barriers to the creation of new faith schools. In particular, the Government will encourage independent schools to enter the maintained sector in their existing premises so that the need for capital funding is not a barrier to entry (DCSF 2007a:18).\n\nThe Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) warned that, despite the government's claims, too many faith schools discriminated against pupils of other religions in their admission policies and set religious requirements in appointing staff. ATL questioned why schools 'in which the majority of funding comes from the state, should, as the government proposes, nurture children in a particular faith' (quoted in The Guardian 10 September 2007).\n\nCovert selection\n\nSchools minister Jim Knight warned schools that he would not tolerate breaches of the new admissions code, which had been in operation for twelve months and was designed to prevent selection and social segregation, after it emerged that nearly eighty schools - most of them faith schools - had been reported to the admissions watchdog and accused of covertly selecting more able students (The Guardian 18 January 2008).\n\nResearch by Rebecca Allen at the University of London Institute of Education (ULIE) showed that, in deprived inner-city areas, religious schools admitted ten per cent fewer poor pupils than was representative of their localities, whereas local authority secondary schools accepted thirty per cent more and therefore had a disproportionately deprived intake. The research also showed that faith schools admitted over fifty per cent more pupils in the top quarter of the ability range (The Observer 2, 13 March 2008).\n\nBarry Sheerman, chair of the Commons Children, Schools and Families Committee, said 'It astonishes me that faith schools are so good at making sure they have fewer children from poorer backgrounds and fewer children with special needs'; and Steve Sinnott, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, commented:\n\nAll the evidence is that when you get pupils from different social classes mixing together, it is a real positive and when you get children of different abilities mixing, it is a real positive. It does not disadvantage the highest achievers, but it does advantage the lowest. Social segregation is not only bad for community cohesion; it is also bad for learning (quoted in The Observer 2 March 2008).\n\nJFS, a Jewish state school in north London, was cleared of racial discrimination against an 11-year-old boy who was denied a place on the grounds that his mother's conversion to Judaism was invalid. High court judge Mr Justice Munby said\n\nThe core aim of JFS is to educate those whom it, in common with the OCR [Office of the Chief Rabbi], considers to be Jews, irrespective of their practice or observance, and in an ethos which is avowedly Orthodox Jewish. That is JFS's aim and that, in my judgement, is in principle an entirely legitimate aim meeting a real need (quoted in The Guardian 4 July 2008).\n\nIn September 2008 it became legal for state-funded faith schools to include religion as a selection criterion for teaching and non-teaching posts. In response, a coalition of Hindu, Christian and Humanist organisations launched the 'Accord' campaign to stop state-funded schools from discriminating against students and teachers on the grounds of religion. Accord's supporters included the scientist Professor Colin Blakemore, former education minister Tessa Blackstone, novelist Philip Pullman, the philosopher AC Grayling and rabbis David Goldberg and Jonathan Romain. Goldberg said faith schools caused people 'to live parallel lives' (The Guardian 30 August 2008).\n\nKrishna-Avanti Primary School in Harrow opened as Europe's first state-funded school for Hindus amid continued concern about the divisive nature of faith schools. It had thirty pupils in its temporary base at Little Stanmore Primary School, but was planned to have 236 pupils in a £10m building which would include a meditation garden. Jonathan Romain commented:\n\nSome parents will feel reassured by a school that shares their faith and cultural background, but everybody should also be aware of the impact this may have - limiting their children's knowledge of and interaction with children from other cultures, and also depriving other community schools of Hindu participation (quoted in The Guardian 15 September 2008).\n\nYear 8 pupils at St Monica's Roman Catholic High School in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, were to have been immunised against cervical cancer as part of the government's £100m programme to vaccinate all 14- to 18-year-old girls. But the governors refused to allow the vaccinations to take place at the school, despite the advice of the Catholic Education Service, which backed the government's campaign against the human papilloma virus (The Guardian 25 September 2008).\n\nThe Chief Schools Adjudicator, Philip Hunter, said more than half of all school authorities were breaching the new admissions code, which aimed to prevent the covert selection of pupils. There had been 'widespread' failure by schools to remove discriminatory questions about parents' marital and employment status from application forms and to make clearer the definitions in their admissions rules. He confirmed Ed Balls' view, expressed earlier in the year, that most of the problems were in faith schools (The Guardian 4 November 2008).\n\nThe Runnymede Trust, a charity set up to promote good race relations, published a report on the way faith schools operated in England. It said the schools should stop selecting pupils according to their religion and do more to serve the most disadvantaged children. Rob Berkeley, the Trust's Deputy Director and author of the report, said:\n\nGiven the importance of issues around cohesion, it's time for a shift, so that schools that are funded by taxpayers are responsive and reflect the needs of all pupils and not just those of a particular religion. It's clear from looking at the data on free school meals that faith schools educate a disproportionately small number of pupils with lower socio-economic status (quoted in The Guardian 4 December 2008).\n\nSchool Admissions Code\n\nA revised version of the School Admissions Code was published in December 2008, to come into force on 10 February 2009.\n\nIn his Foreword to the Code, Ed Balls wrote:\n\nThrough the Education and Skills Act 2008 we have strengthened the statutory admissions framework to ensure that all schools adopt fair and lawful admissions practices. Local authorities have an important role to monitor compliance with the Code and are now required to report annually to the Schools Adjudicator on the fairness and legality of the admission arrangements for all schools in their area. As the independent enforcer of fair access to schools, the Schools Adjudicator now has a wider remit to consider any admission arrangements that come to his attention in addition to any complaints received through an objection. The Schools Adjudicator will report annually to the Secretary of State on how fair access is being achieved locally (DCSF 2008c:7).\n\nThe Admissions Code\n\nbanned schools from holding interviews with parents and/or children\n\nas a method for deciding whether a child is to be offered a place at a school. Interviews must not form part of the admissions process and admission authorities must not use either face-to-face interviews or interviews by telephone or other means (DCSF 2008c:20);\n\nreiterated the ban on the introduction of selection by ability, other than for banding or for sixth forms:\n\nOnly grammar schools or schools with partially selective arrangements which already had such arrangements in place during the 1997-98 school year are permitted to continue to use selection by ability (DCSF 2008c:21);\n\nendorsed the use of home-school agreements as 'a useful means of promoting greater involvement by parents in their children's education' (DCSF 2008c:21), but made clear that\n\nschools must not ask parents to sign, or express a willingness to sign, agreements before they have been offered a place at the school (DCSF 2008c:21);\n\nargued that school uniform played 'a valuable role in contributing to the ethos and setting the tone of a school' (DCSF 2008c:26), but called on governing bodies to\n\nlimit the expense of uniforms so that parents on low incomes do not feel that the prospective cost of the uniform means that they cannot apply for their preferred school (DCSF 2008c:26);\n\nbanned local authorities and governing bodies from asking for\n\nany form of payment or for voluntary contributions, donations or deposits (even if refundable) as part of the admissions process (DCSF 2008c:27); and\n\nreminded faith schools that they were required\n\nto offer every child who applies, whether of their faith, another faith or no faith, a place at the school if there are places available (DCSF 2008c:36).\n\nOther concerns\n\nIn 2007, the Roman Catholic Church in Northern Ireland instructed its schools to disband Amnesty International support groups because of the charity's pro-abortion stance (The Guardian 18 September 2007); and the Bishop of Lancaster, Patrick O'Donoghue, issued a 66-page document in which he instructed Catholic schools in his area to stop 'safe-sex' education, put a crucifix in every classroom, use science to teach about the 'truths of the faith', only mention sex within the 'sacrament of marriage', insist that contraception was wrong and prohibit support for charities 'that promote or fund anti-life policies, such as Red Nose Day and Amnesty International, which now advocates abortion'. The Commons Children, Schools and Families Committee summoned Catholic bishops to appear before them to answer charges that they were promoting religious fundamentalism in their schools (The Observer 30 December 2007).\n\nIn March 2009, Ed Balls asked Ofsted to carry out a survey of the 'moral values' of independent faith schools after concerns were raised about Muslim schools. Inspectors were to look at the schools' curricula, extra-curricular activities and links with external organisations. Since 2003, independent schools had been required to enable pupils to develop their self-knowledge, self-esteem and self-confidence, to distinguish right from wrong, to respect the law, to have a broad general knowledge of England's public institutions and services and to appreciate and respect their own and other cultures in a way that promoted 'tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions' (The Guardian 9 March 2009).\n\nIn November 2009 The Times Educational Supplement reported that booster classes for primary and GCSE pupils were being held in four Muslim supplementary schools (madrassas) in Bradford. The pilot scheme, funded with £550,000 of public money over three years, was said to be making a difference to pupils' exam results, but the scheme was controversial. National Secular Society President Terry Sanderson commented:\n\nThese institutions are devoted almost entirely to pumping Islam into the heads of their pupils. We need to know who will keep tabs on these indoctrination centres to ensure taxpayers' money is properly spent. Although there is no suggestion that the Yorkshire scheme is suspect, if this kind of idea rolls out, who knows what will happen? (quoted in The Times Educational Supplement 6 November 2009).\n\nSelection\n\nIn his speech to the annual conference of the National College of School Leadership (NCSL) in Birmingham in June 2008, Ed Balls argued that the continued existence of 164 grammar schools was consigning children to failure at the age of 11:\n\nLet me make it clear that I don't like selection. I accept though that selection is a local decision for parents and local authorities. But I do not accept that children in secondary moderns should be left to fall behind.\n\nSome secondary moderns are showing that it is possible to achieve really excellent results. But the fact is that selection does make it more difficult for these schools. They still have a much more deprived intake than their neighbouring grammar schools - over six times more in fact (quoted in The Guardian 20 June 2008).\n\nHe promised £1m for every 'struggling' secondary modern school to fund partnerships with other schools (The Guardian 20 June 2008).\n\nPeter Newsam, former Director of the University of London Insititute of Education (ULIE), suggested that England's grammar schools could be turned into sixth-form colleges (The Guardian 17 November 2009).\n\nMeanwhile, the eleven plus was abolished in Northern Ireland, but Roman Catholic grammar schools in the province - along with 34 state grammar schools whose pupils were mostly Protestant - were determined to fight the decision. In September 2009 Catholic schools set their own entrance exams, against the advice of their bishop and of Sinn Féin education minister Catriona Ruane, who told the schools they were 'holding to ransom' the overwhelming majority of pupils, parents, schools and teachers who wanted to see an end to selection (The Guardian 8 September 2009).\n\nUlster Unionists demanded the reintroduction of some form of eleven-plus test and said they would refuse to support the transfer of policing and justice powers to the Stormont assembly on 7 March 2010 - the 'Hillsborough' deal which was vital to keep the assembly in operation - unless an agreement on the eleven plus was reached (The Guardian 12 February 2010).\n\nThe National Challenge\n\nIn February 2008 Ed Balls told The Guardian that he was determined to tackle the 638 state secondary schools which Ofsted said were 'failing'. Local authorities had until the summer to develop individual action plans for the schools and, if they failed to improve, they would have to become academies or trust schools, or close altogether (The Guardian 25 February 2008).\n\nA fortnight later, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling warned that the deadline for the 638 schools to improve or face closure would be brought forward to 2011. He announced a £200m plan to give the schools intensive support (The Guardian 13 March 2008).\n\nThree months later, local authorities were told they had fifty days to submit their action plans for the 638 schools, which would be given three years to improve or face being closed down, merged or turned into academies (The Observer 8 June 2008). The last option would have been problematic in the case of several of the schools, which were already academies.\n\nEd Balls launched the 'National Challenge' on 10 June 2008, with funding of £400m. Its target was that at least thirty per cent of pupils in each secondary school should achieve a minimum of five A*-C grade GCSEs including English and maths by 2011.\n\nThe National Challenge aimed to tackle 'the link between deprivation and attainment' and offered 'targeted help for teaching and learning', support to develop strong leadership, the flexibility to design 'local bespoke solutions' and 'more radical changes' such as the setting up of academies and National Challenge Trusts 'where this would benefit the school'. Each of the 360 schools on the National Challenge list was to have a dedicated adviser working closely with the head, supporting the school directly and brokering additional support, tailored to the school's needs. The formation of partnerships between schools would be encouraged (The Guardian 11 June 2008).\n\nJohn Dunford, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), warned that\n\nThe constantly increasing target for the number of academies is not helpful and will create turmoil where consistent, steady improvement is the proper aim of school leaders and governors (quoted in The Guardian 11 June 2008).\n\nWhile the £400m injection was welcome, schools would 'not be helped by the threat of closure or academy status which will hang over many of these schools for the next three years', he said (The Guardian 11 June 2008).\n\nThe National Union of Teachers (NUT) challenged ministers' claims that the 638 schools were failing. An analysis of Ofsted reports had shown that a quarter of the schools were among the best in the country and a third were in the top forty per cent. Half were considered to be satisfactory and meeting pupils' needs. NUT Acting General Secretary Christine Blower wrote to the heads of the 638 schools offering support in fighting against the 'arbitrary target' and threat of closure. Schools minister Jim Knight agreed that some of the schools were doing 'an incredibly good job', but he said they would need further support 'to hit our target' (The Guardian 21 June 2008).\n\nIn November 2008, Ed Balls announced that schools which were achieving satisfactory results but were failing to improve were to be labelled as 'coasting' and given targeted support to improve or face intervention from their local authorities. Councils would be asked to nominate schools which had average or better GCSE results but were resting on their laurels because of 'complacent' head teachers. Hundreds of schools were expected to be identified, including some grammar schools. Teachers' unions warned against putting 'crude' labels on schools (The Guardian 13 November 2008).\n\nIn January 2009, the DCSF added eighty more schools to the National Challenge list, bringing the total to 440. However, data in the annual school league tables showed that more than 200 of these schools had done well enough to move above the government's threshold of thirty per cent of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and maths (The Guardian 15 January 2009).\n\nIn June 2009, Ed Balls wrote to all local authorities in England which had National Challenge schools. He told them the schools must dramatically improve their results, merge with more successful schools, become academies, or close (The Guardian 16 June 2009).\n\nThe inspection regime\n\nIn December 2007 Ofsted announced plans to improve the system for monitoring classroom standards. From 2009 its inspectors would conduct 'snap visits' to schools (ie without giving the normal 48 hours' notice) and would make greater use of 'local intelligence' - complaints from parents - to investigate schools where it was feared that standards were slipping (The Guardian 13 December 2007).\n\nThree months later, Chief Inspector Christine Gilbert announced another shake-up of the inspection regime. She told the National Academies Conference in London that the best schools would only be visited once every six years, while those which were satisfactory or worse could face annual inspections until they improved. She added that Ofsted would focus more on the 'shocking' number of pupils who left primary schools without mastering basic literacy and numeracy skills - the '3Rs' (The Guardian 8 February 2008).\n\nResearchers at the University of London Institute of Education (ULIE) said schools were manipulating the system of 'lighter touch' Ofsted inspections to exaggerate their success. Self-evaluation forms, introduced in 2005, allowed head teachers to give rosy judgements of their schools' performance which inspectors then failed to investigate, they claimed (The Guardian 24 March 2008).\n\nIn May 2008 Gilbert announced two further changes to the Ofsted inspection regime. First, she told the House of Commons Children, Schools and Families Committee that there would be more lesson observation, following criticism that Ofsted reports focused too much on schools' test results and not enough on what was happening in the classroom. She also raised concerns about poorly performing teachers, saying that it often took too long to 'get rid of them' (The Guardian 15 May 2008).\n\nA few days later she announced that Ofsted would intensify pressure on the lowest-performing and 'coasting' schools which were failing to improve. Standards had 'stalled', she said, and 'the gap between outcomes for specific groups of children and young people and the majority remains too large' (The Guardian 20 May 2008).\n\nIn August 2008 it was revealed that Ofsted was sending out letters to children as young as four, setting out complaints about their schools and warning the children that their teachers were not preparing them properly for their 'future adult lives'. Chris Keates, General Secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) said the letters were 'ill-conceived'. 'The letters in effect give licence to pupils to question the professionalism of the school and its staff', she said. An Ofsted spokeswoman said the letters were 'a valuable tool in engaging pupils in both the inspection and subsequent school improvement' (The Guardian 16 August 2008).\n\nIn January 2009 Gilbert announced that Ofsted was to launch a crackdown on 'boring' teaching; this was in response to concerns that children's behaviour was deteriorating because they were not being sufficiently stimulated in class. Inspectors would tell struggling schools what was going wrong in their lessons and explain why pupils were not paying attention, she said (The Guardian 5 January 2009).\n\nOfsted's Annual Report for 2008-2009, published in November 2009, said there had been a sustained four-year increase in the number of schools rated good or outstanding, but that some schools were being held back by a 'stubborn core' of inadequate teaching which 'fails to inspire, challenge and extend children, young people and adult learners' (Ofsted 2009b:8).\n\nThe new inspection regime was criticised by children's services chiefs and head teachers' leaders, who said it was forcing social work departments to focus on passing inspections instead of looking after children; good schools were being rated as mediocre on routine technical matters;"
