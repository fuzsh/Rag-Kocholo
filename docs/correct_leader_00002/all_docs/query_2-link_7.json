        "text": "Less than two years ago, when Gordon Brown was in his early months as prime minister, the Spectator published a long article about how he was doing. The rightwing magazine had always been an immovable critic of New Labour, but now it struck a startlingly different note. \"The sense of liberation [in Brown] ... is palpable,\" wrote its editor, Matthew d'Ancona, who had accompanied Brown on a visit to the US. \"Every morning he clearly awakes and thinks ... 'I am prime minister!'\" D'Ancona concluded: \"This PM's greatest triumph to date has been to persuade the world that he is not an exhausted traveller, limping and grey after 10 years in office [as chancellor], but a man at the very start of a journey.\"\n\nIn the summer and early autumn of 2007 such assessments were common across the political spectrum of the British press. \"Brown could be the first Labour leader since Clement Attlee to recast British society,\" wrote Neal Lawson of the leftwing pressure group Compass in this newspaper. Brown's performances at prime minister's questions \"have been masterly\", wrote Alice Thomson in the Daily Telegraph. \"Brown is wrongfooting Cameron,\" wrote Fraser Nelson in the same paper. \"Brown could be a great PM,\" wrote Peter Oborne in the Daily Mail.\n\nNowadays all this praise and excitement reads like something from a parallel universe. Brown is a prime minister so beleaguered, so unpopular and seemingly exhausted, so apparently luckless and unsuited to the job, that he attracts general ridicule and even pity. Parliamentary sketchwriters and political bloggers describe him as a baited bear, a human car crash, painful to watch. News of his humiliations travels the world: last month the Tehran Times reprinted a New York Times piece about the \"naked contempt\" towards Brown shown by Cameron and other opposition MPs in the Commons.\n\n\"On shows like Have I Got News For You, you can get a cheap laugh by simply uttering the words 'Gordon Brown',\" says someone who has known Brown for decades, one of many people who - out of caution or compassion - would only speak to me about the prime minister off the record. Another well-connected Labour figure and former Brown fan says he has been a \"catastrophic leader\". Critics compare him as a leader to John Major, Anthony Eden, Richard Nixon: political bywords for incompetence, poor judgment, bitter failure. \"He's teetering on the brink of being the worst PM of my lifetime,\" says the veteran political writer and novelist Robert Harris.\n\nTomorrow, British voters will give their own verdict at the European and local elections. Labour's opinion poll figures are currently at an unprecedented low: between 22% and 16%. On Saturday, the health secretary Alan Johnson warned that Labour would do very badly in the elections. It is possible Labour will do so badly that in a few days or weeks, Brown might not even be PM - either through an internal coup, with Johnson the current favourite to usurp him, or, less likely but talked about by some Labour figures I interviewed, Brown's sudden resignation. If he survives, the next general election looms. It is a year away at most, with Labour requiring a near-miraculous recovery in its electoral standing to avoid defeat. Brown's premiership, it seems probable, will not make it past the three-year mark. Even John Major managed six and a half.\n\nUnlucky in his timing\n\nFor almost a quarter of a century, from his election as a fierce young MP in 1983 to his first surefooted weeks in 10 Downing Street in 2007, Brown has been one of the most formidable British politicians, revered for his intellect and social conscience, feared for his relentlessness and behind-the-scenes manoeuvres. Why, then, has his premiership gone so badly?\n\nSome of it has been down to circumstances. When Brown took office in 2007, Labour had already been in power for a decade, a long time in British politics. After the disasters and controversies of Iraq, and domestic policy disappointments from the private finance initiative to increased inequality, and with the Conservatives reviving under Cameron, Labour's popularity was on the slide. \"Blair just dumped this [political inheritance] in our lap and cleared off,\" says Harris, once a keen Blair supporter. In 2007, the long economic boom that had helped keep Labour in government since 1997 also started to stall. \"Brown will be remembered,\" says Harris, \"as incredibly unlucky in his timing.\"\n\nYet the circumstances in which he became prime minister were also partly of his own making. He had not opposed the invasion of Iraq. As chancellor, as is now infamous, he had failed to deal with an unsustainable property and personal debt bubble. He had also missed opportunities to replace Blair as prime minister, in the three or four years leading up to 2007, when the economy and Labour's ratings were still relatively healthy. Exactly when and how Brown should have acted against Blair, and to what extent Blair may have deceived or outmanoeuvred him, is still a matter of debate among Westminster watchers; but most of them agree on one thing: Brown is, as one puts it, \"grossly indecisive\".\n\nWhen he was chancellor, his appetite for deep reading and private pondering was often seen as a strength. \"Brown plays his cards against his chest,\" a civil servant told me in 2004. \"Very important decisions won't be on an official piece of paper until days before the deadline. In Whitehall, the question 'What will Gordon say?' hangs over everything.\" But for a prime minister, presented daily with unexpected dilemmas, this sort of late decision-making can be disastrous. Brown's critics cite, for example, his slow response to the long-approaching storm over MPs' expenses, which has allowed a more nimble and shameless Cameron, despite the arguably worse behaviour of his MPs, to emerge with credit; the government's ponderous U-turn over the treatment of Gurkha veterans; the protracted controversy over the 10p tax band; and, above all, his dithering over calling a general election in autumn 2007, when he was enjoying his prime-ministerial honeymoon.\n\n\"Brown is a victim of his own internal contradictions, between being clever-clever and tactical, and long-term and serious,\" says Richard Reeves, director of the thinktank Demos and a former Labour policy adviser. \"As prime minister he's zigzagged between the two modes and ended up with the worst of both worlds: looking as political as Cameron with none of the charisma.\"\n\nBrown also suffers terribly, say his critics, from being reticent and stiff in public. In these stormy times, argues Reeves, his image as the \"weathered, slightly scowling captain at the helm of the battered ship\" is not necessarily a bad fit, except that, \"a leader has to communicate. He's quite good on radio. He would probably have done quite well in the 19th century, making long speeches like Gladstone. But nowadays the principal medium is televisual.\"\n\nSearching for the right tone\n\nOn TV these days, Brown looks tired and grey. Sometimes he has eye bags under his eye bags. His words often come in indigestible clots - \"what we are taking on the recession is action\" - or prefaced by a flustered stutter. His voice is thinner, less booming than in his commanding years as chancellor. His heavy shoulders seem tense with fury when Cameron taunts him at prime minister's questions. His on-camera smile, too sudden and too wide, looks false and pleading.\n\n\"It's almost a physical discomfort to watch him,\" says David Runciman, a politics lecturer at Cambridge. \"Brown is an almost pathological version of a closed-off politician. That kind of personality is clearly very good at politicking behind the scenes. Chancellors are meant to be closed off. They keep secrets from us, go into purdah - it's the least democratic office of state. But the relentless exposure of being prime minister makes that sort of closed-off politician vulnerable.\"\n\nOff-camera, in private or semi-private situations, Brown can be good company - even now. He can laugh about politics and its cruelties and ironies. He is not grand. He talks with an appealing Scottish directness and informality. But in his public pronouncements he seems to suppress this side of himself. In a London Review of Books article published the year before Brown became prime minister, Runciman foresaw the dangers of taking this approach in 10 Downing Street. Modern politics, he suggested, favoured leaders such as Blair and Cameron who appeared \"comfortable in [their] own skin\"; Brown, with his old-fashioned notion of keeping his public and private selves separate, would come across as \"someone who is always holding something back\", \"a man who was happy to conceal the true state of his feelings\". In the era of confessional web chat and tearful celebrity interviews, Runciman implied, Brown's reined-in public persona would not be acceptable to voters if he became prime minister.\n\nAs premier, his attempts to lighten up - the TV smile, the toe-curlingly \"casual\" YouTube appearances - have only made matters worse. \"The greatest crime of all in the modern media age,\" says Reeves, \"is being inauthentic.\"\n\nAnd yet, there remains something puzzling about Brown's inability to find the right tone. Because in certain contexts, he can. Two weeks ago, I watched him campaigning for the European and local elections in Tamworth near Birmingham. He was midway through another grim week: another wounding prime minister's questions, an attack on him by the Confederation of British Industry, more Labour MPs with questionable expenses. Minutes before he was due to arrive in Tamworth, for a visit to a college, the sun disappeared and a cold soaking storm blew in. One of the college staff muttered something to me about the weather being appropriate.\n\nThen the official car pulled up, the sun almost instantly reappeared, and Brown got out. He looked a bit pale in the glare, but there was a vigour in his walk, in his barrel chest and big head - the body of an old-style Labour politician - and his short, strong legs. He made straight for a cluster of middle-aged female staff in white aprons who were standing to one side of the reception committee. As he clasped the women's hands, asked them questions and smiled sparingly but genuinely, there was an unexpected ease, almost a flirtatiousness in his manner. Afterwards, in a hot room jammed with tables of local dignatories and voters, there was more of the same comfortable charm. Brown put his hand on people's shoulders, held the backs of their chairs, moved courteously from table to table (\"can I join you?\"), and leaned in close to listen when people spoke.\n\nIt was a reminder that Brown had not risen up the Labour party by brainpower and bullying alone. At Tamworth station afterwards, I ran into a man who had just met Brown at the college. What had he made of the prime minister? \"He seemed relaxed,\" the man said. \"You feel if he could meet everyone in the country he would be all right.\" People used to say the same about John Major.\n\nSerious politics, serious people\n\nFor most of Brown's career, many of the qualities now seen as his weaknesses were seen as strengths. At Edinburgh University, where he studied history, Brown was already a hard-nosed political operator. \"To be in Gordon's gang,\" says one of his biographers, \"you had to declare undying loyalty. Brown has a weakness for surrounding himself with ... nasty people. It's almost as if he's convinced himself that if they're out breaking legs, it has nothing to do with him, as if he knows in his head, 'I am a good man'.\" In fact, this April a senior Brown aide, Damian McBride, was forced to resign after it was revealed he had suggested that a Labour-supporting website mount a smear campaign against senior Conservatives.\n\nBy the age of 23, Brown was already enough of a name to be \"invited\" (his word) to seek a Labour candidacy for the October 1974 general election. To his later regret, Brown decided not to stand - an early sign, perhaps, of his disabling caution - and Labour narrowly lost the Edinburgh South seat. It took Brown another nine years to get into parliament, but he used them shrewdly. He taught politics and worked as a TV producer for three years - something that slightly undermines the notion that he has no understanding of the medium.\n\nAs an MP from 1983, he quickly became known as an agile Commons performer. His biographer Paul Routledge records the late Tory diarist Alan Clark, then employment minister, writing of a debate that December: \"I got into difficulty almost immediately. [Brown and Blair] were bobbing up all over the place, asking impossible ... questions of detail.\"\n\nAs shadow chancellor in New Labour's government-in-waiting in the mid-90s, Brown's aptitude and appetite for the game of politics seemed almost limitless. In Out of the Shadows, the first of a pair of 1997 documentaries made by Scottish TV, his advisers deliver delighted asides to camera about the expert ambushes and harrying operations with which they are tormenting the fading Conservative government. Politics for Brown and his gang looks the best fun in the world.\n\n\"He has the biggest political brain in the Labour party,\" says someone who knows him well. \"He has the ability to see where the politics of something is going. But that means he is constantly trying to trick everything to get to where he wants. All of his great virtues are the flipside of his failings.\"\n\nIn We Are the Treasury, the second of the two documentaries, a change seems to come over Brown once he is in government. The cunning little grins are gone; instead he looks grave. The camera follows him and his aides on their first tour of 11 Downing Street. Brown's spin doctor Charlie Whelan makes a joke about selling off the pictures to raise revenues. Brown is not amused. He gazes at the grand offices with reverence.\n\n\"He's very conscious of how he's perceived,\" an old friend of his told me in 2004. \"He has worked very hard to cultivate his iron chancellor image. He thinks it gives him authority. He thinks that's the way politics should be - serious politics, serious people.\"\n\nSome Brown-watchers detected a new sternness even before he entered office. \"In interviews he began to develop a relentless style,\" writes James Naughtie in The Rivals, his book about Brown and Blair. \"In May 1993 Alan Watkins wrote that Brown had been 'for some months now on a kind of automatic pilot which enables him to repeat meaningless phrases in a monotone.'\" Brown's favoured 90s phrases - \"prudence with a purpose\", \"no return to boom and bust\" - are even easier to mock in 2009. Yet for many years they fulfilled their role: to transform Labour's prospects by making its economic policies sound authoritative.\n\nWatching Brown's budget speeches from his dominant years as chancellor again now, it is striking how imperfect his Commons persona was even then: the pallor, the eye bags, the over-reliance on preparation and inability to improvise are already in evidence. But as long as the economy was purring along, the fact that his booming rhetorical epics of statistics and jargon made most people tune out did not matter; he was like a successful chief executive addressing a shareholders' meeting, and the shareholders did not have to listen to every word, or even like him much, to feel he was doing a great job.\n\n\"He always seemed to be in complete control of the subject, with these blocks of words that just came out,\" says the economist and independent peer Lord Skidelsky. \"He mastered the language of economics. [But] my hunch is that he never understood it very deeply. He had no effective counters to the dominant ideas of the day.\" During Brown's time as chancellor and shadow chancellor, the dominant economic philosophy was pro-business, pro-banker and anti-regulation. In Skidelsky's view, Brown - like almost every senior British politician - \"bought it all.\"\n\nFor Brown, who in 1989 had written that \"unbridled capitalism is inefficient as well as unfair\", and who retained a strong commitment to reducing poverty, this conversion to free-market economics was a stretch. \"What markets do is have winners and losers,\" Neal Lawson told me in 2004. \"That clearly has a conflict with a politics that is about equality. That's a contradiction in Gordon's politics.\" But it is not a contradiction, reportedly, that his advisers have been keen to point out. \"Unlike Blair, Brown is not challenged by his advisers intellectually,\" says Reeves. \"Brown is intellectually curious, well-read. But where are the real intellectuals in Downing Street? Gordon has filled it with apparatchiks and spinners.\" One of his biographers says: \"Once he's made up his mind, he will not change it. Because he thinks he's thought through the issue much more deeply than anyone else.\"\n\nNow that \"boom and bust\" has undeniably returned, and Labour's conversion to capitalism no longer looks like a vote-winner, the downsides of Brown's sense of certainty are painfully obvious. It is hard, perhaps impossible, for him to say he was wrong about the free market and how best to run the British economy. \"You can't expect a PM to repudiate his chancellorship, if he's been chancellor for 10 years,\" says Skidelsky. While last autumn Brown took bold and seemingly effective action to avert a banking meltdown, and was rewarded with a revival in the polls, he has been unable to take lasting political advantage of the crisis in financial capitalism and free-market thinking, which for other left-of-centre politicians, such as Barack Obama, is proving a rare opportunity. \"The crisis has created something like a progressive consensus, but he's been unable to lead it, mould it,\" says Reeves. \"The person who will probably preside over this consensus [in Britain] is David Cameron.\"\n\nDuring the long prelude to Brown's premiership, even his worst enemies did not predict he would preside over the deepest recession for decades. But many of his shortcomings were exhaustively discussed. He had \"psychological flaws\", \"the social skills of a whelk\", the doomed determination of a character in \"a Shakespearean tragedy\" - such poison darts, usually fired by anonymous Blairites, landed in thousands of political columns. Sometimes even Blair himself discreetly took part. In 2006, shortly before Brown finally clambered over him to become prime minister, Blair told a journalist who prefers not to be named, \"If he [Brown] is going to make a fist of being PM, he's got to change his way of operating. Can he change? Probably not.\"\n\nIn fact, these attacks probably helped Brown in his first months as prime minister, by so lowering expectations that his calm handling of 2007's floods and terrorist plots received disproportionate praise.\n\nAnd despite the barbs, Brown survived as his party's heir apparent for 13 years - far longer than politicians usually do in this perilous role. Brown's opinion poll ratings between 1994 and 2007 suffered only passing dips. It has been quickly forgotten over the last two years that, compared to Blair's chatshow fluency, Brown's stern and awkward public manner was often considered a virtue. \"A lot of the Labour tribe like closedness,\" says one party insider. Brown's capture of the premiership also owed much to the lack of a serious rival; to his perceived moral authority and sheer doggedness; to his careful alliance-building - every new Labour MP after the 1997 and 2001 general elections received an invitation to 11 Downing Street; and, finally, to a fear in the party of what might happen if he did not get the leadership.\n\nAs a Brown premiership approached, senior Conservatives regarded it with an unresolved mixture of eagerness and trepidation. In 2004 a party strategist, now working for Cameron, told me: \"There's a very superficial view which is that Brown's good news for the Tories: more leftwing, more old Labour, more scary to Middle England. But he is probably the most sophisticated political operator in the country. It wouldn't surprise me if he had some plan to neutralise those perceptions. And operationally he'd be a far more effective prime minister than Blair, because of his attention to detail.\"\n\nFleeting public approval\n\nIt hasn't worked out like that. A former Labour minister who has worked for both Brown and Blair says, \"Brown tends to hunker down when things go badly. Work more. Sleep less. Spend less time with his advisers. The impact is incredibly transparent. By contrast, Tony Blair seemed almost to thrive on pressure.\" The former minister cites the G20 summit as an example of the big-picture politics that Brown has done well. Yet, like his rescue of the financial system, the G20 won him acclaim and influence abroad, but only fleeting public approval at home. This says something about the attention span of British voters; but it also says something about the over-elaborate feel of the Brown government. \"There have been too many initiatives,\" says the former minister. \"I don't think he has been able to plant a firm enough idea of what he stands for.\"\n\nThis week, in the wake of the expenses scandal, he has announced he is considering \"a new constitutional settlement\", including reducing the voting age to 16, creating a Bill of Rights and written constitution, completing the reform of the House of Lords and extending the Freedom of Information Act. Brown is full of other big ideas: that climate change and the recession require a new form of international co-operation and a new form of capitalism; that the public's involvement in British democracy needs to be rethought and renewed; that the world is living through the greatest period of change since the industrial revolution; that today is nevertheless \"a progressive age\".\n\nWhen Major's administration was equally beleaguered, all it seemed to come up with was the traffic cones hotline. And yet, there is something escapist about Brown's preference for the longterm and the global when his most pressing problems are short-term and national.\n\nBrown is by all accounts a proud, highly emotional man. Friends talk of how he fears being thought of as a bad prime minister. \"He believes in himself, even now,\" says another close acquaintance. When you watch Brown campaigning, it is striking that he often mentions New Labour's achievements before he became premier - the greatly improved state provision for young children, for example. Given that under Blair, Brown was in many areas of domestic policy the de facto prime minister, this seems justified: there is a case to be made that his Downing Street career should be judged on the last 12 years, not just the last two.\n\nYet his critics and many voters are unlikely to see it that way. If Brown is to survive both this week's and next year's elections, he probably needs a sensational event, much more compelling than the imminent and heavily trailed cabinet reshuffle: a huge further twist in the banking and expenses crises, a freakish economic recovery, the bursting of the Cameron bubble. Before writing Brown off, it may be worth recalling that in 1991 the Major government was dismissed as \"pathetic\" (the Daily Mail), \"exhausted\" (the Financial Times) and \"a rabble ... [with] the look of death\" (the Independent on Sunday). Less than a year later, Major was returned to office\n\nBut in all probability Brown will soon need a new job. For years he has expressed an interest in the workings and reform of the International Monetary Fund, a body that has long tried to recruit senior Labour politicians, and where a big strategic brain matters more than a televisual manner. Brown also has a large and justified reputation among the international anti-poverty lobby.\n\n\"He's resilient,\" says an old friend from outside politics. \"Many bad things have happened to him. He lost his first child. He lost the sight of an eye. The last thing in the world Gordon wants is pity. He doesn't mind being hated. He would loathe being pitied.\" The next few days may be tough."
