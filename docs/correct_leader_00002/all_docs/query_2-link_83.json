        "text": "Back in 1999 Gordon Brown started selling 56% of the UK's gold reserves - at what turned out to be pretty close to the bottom of the market. He got it away at an average sales price of $276 an ounce. The price today is $2320. In the last month Coutts has been letting its clients know that it will be cutting their UK equity holdings down from 33% to 3.5% (for the adventurous portfolio). But just as their CIO is about to get selling, there are signs the UK is bottoming out. Note that UBS (a rather bigger wealth manager than Coutts) has upgraded us from least preferred to most preferred (hooray...) while the BHP bid for Anglo is something of a global signal that the UK is cheap. Might Fahad Kamal, the CIO of Coutts, be about to become the Gordon Brown of UK equities? https://lnkd.in/eSp9Fcgn"
