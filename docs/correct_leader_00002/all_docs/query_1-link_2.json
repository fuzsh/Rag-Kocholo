        "text": "Gordon Brown, (born Feb. 20, 1951, Glasgow, Scot.), Scottish-born British politician and prime minister (2007–10). Brown worked as a teacher and a journalist before winning election in 1983 to the House of Commons as a member of the Labour Party. He subsequently became friends with Tony Blair, and the two men soon found themselves at the forefront of the campaign to modernize Labour’s political philosophy, replacing the goal of state socialism with a more pragmatic, market-friendly strategy. After Labour’s landslide victory in 1997, Blair became prime minister, and Brown was named chancellor of the Exchequer. Under Brown’s leadership, Great Britain experienced a period of relatively steady economic growth, but increased public spending and government borrowing became growing concerns. In June 2007 Blair stepped down as prime minister and as Labour leader, and Brown succeeded him in both posts. Brown’s tenure was troubled by economic crisis and a political scandal involving the abuse of expense accounts by members of Parliament. In the British general election on May 6, 2010, the Labour Party lost its majority in the House of Commons, finishing second to the Conservatives, and though no party achieved a majority, Brown resigned as both leader of the Labour Party and as prime minister."
