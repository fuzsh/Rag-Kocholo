        "text": "Brown faced no opposition in the campaign to succeed Blair as Labour Party leader, and on June 27, 2007, three days after he officially became Labour Party leader, Brown became prime minister. He pledged to make reform of the National Health Service a major priority, to retain the various public-sector reforms that had been implemented by Blair, and to “wage an unremitting battle against poverty.” In foreign policy Brown argued that the global fight against terrorism “involves more than military force,” and, though he had close ties with the United States and had been seen as somewhat more skeptical than Blair of many aspects of the European Union (EU), it was anticipated that he would pursue a course that focused British policy on British interests rather than on developing a closer relationship with either the United States or the EU.\n\nBrown’s government was severely tested in 2008–09 when a worldwide financial crisis and ensuing recession hit Britain hard. His problems multiplied in the spring of 2009, when against a backdrop of growing unemployment a political scandal erupted, involving the widespread abuse of expense accounts by members of Parliament, including members of Brown’s cabinet, some of whom resigned (a major cabinet reshuffle followed). Largely as a result of the scandal and the recession, Labour’s popularity plummeted, and the party performed very poorly in local British elections and in elections for the European Parliament.\n\nFollowing the particularly disastrous European elections on June 4, 2009, when Labour secured only 15.7 percent of the vote across the British mainland, there were efforts once again to oust Brown as party leader. James Purnell, the secretary of state for work and pensions, resigned from Brown’s cabinet and claimed that Brown’s “continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more, not less likely.…I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our party a fighting chance of winning.” Brown’s allies worked furiously to ensure that no other minister followed Purnell’s example. None did, but Brown’s authority was visibly weakened. To avoid a challenge, he met with Labour MPs and promised to change the way he led.\n\nAlso in 2009 Brown’s efforts to stimulate the economy produced an ever-increasing budget deficit, which weighed down the prime minister’s poll ratings as a general election loomed. In January 2010 two former cabinet members called for a secret ballot on Brown’s leadership, well in advance of the parliamentary election required by law to take place by June 3. Though support for Brown was slow in coming and lukewarm, no vote was taken, and he held on to the party leadership heading into the election. Brown agreed that before the election was held he would testify before the most recent and extensive inquiry into the conduct of the Iraq War. In 2010 the prime minister helped facilitate a deal between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin that would devolve justice and policing power to Northern Ireland by April 2010; stalemate over the issue had threatened possible suspension of devolution and the reimposition of direct rule from London.\n\nIn the British general election on May 6, 2010, the Labour Party lost its majority in the House of Commons, finishing second to the Conservatives, but no party achieved a majority. Shortly thereafter Brown announced that he would be stepping down as Labour leader. On May 11, after negotiations to form a coalition government with the third-place-finishing Liberal Democrats failed, Brown tendered his resignation as prime minister."
