        "text": "Administrative / biographical background:\n\nGordon Brown served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 2007. The Treasury is responsible for the overall management of the economy. With support from Treasury officials, the Chancellor of the Exchequer advises and implements economic and financial functions in order to aid the running of the United Kingdom. The collection covers records created by the private office of Gordon Brown during his tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer working under the Labour Government. The Chancellors responsibilities cover: fiscal policy (including the presenting of the annual Budget); monetary policy; setting inflation targets; ministerial arrangements (in his role as Second Lord of the Treasury).\n\nKey topics during Gordon Brown's tenure include:\n\nSale of UK gold reserves Between 1999-2002: Brown sold approximately half of the UK's gold reserves following an extended bear market. The official stated reason for this sale was to diversify the assets of the UK's reserves away from gold, which was deemed to be too volatile\n\nNational Minimum Wage Act 1998: In 1998 the Chancellor introduced a National Minimum Wage for the first time in Britain. This secured minimum wage of Â£3.60 per hour, with lower rates for younger workers.\n\nSure Start: An initiative announced in 1998 by Gordon Brown with the intention of giving children the best possible start in life through improvement of childcare, early education, health, and family support, with an emphasis on outreach and community development.\n\nChild Trust Fund Launched in 2005: The Chancellor introduced a cash-endowment for every child born after 31st August 2002 based on parental income."
