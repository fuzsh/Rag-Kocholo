Its central argument is that Gordon Brown's rewriting of the British monetary constitution in May 1997 constituted political manipulation in a Rikerian sense. The government removed a contentious issue from party politics in order to signal competence and enforce internal discipline. Building on Elster's constraint theory, the paper argues that Brown adopted a pre-commitment strategy aimed at binding others. The heresthetic move had dual consequences, both constraining and enabling. The institutionalization of discipline enabled New Labour to achieve economic and political goals. By revisiting the political rationality of precommitment, this article questions the dominant credibility story underlying the choice of economic institutions.\n\nType\n\nArticles\n\nInformation\n\nBritish Journal of Political Science , Volume 43 , Issue 2 , April 2013 , pp. 263 - 293\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123412000221 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2012\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.
