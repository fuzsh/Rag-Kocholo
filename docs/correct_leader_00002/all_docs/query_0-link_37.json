In interviews in advance of the visit, Brown has stressed repeatedly his interest in serving as the bridge between the United States and United Kingdom on a number of common challenges.\n\nIn addition to meeting with President George Bush, Brown will be meeting with all three of the major presidential candidates in this year’s election to ensure close U.S.-UK ties after Bush leaves office.\n\nQ2: What is the state of U.S.-UK relations at present?\n\nA2: While U.S.-UK relations have remained generally positive under Brown’s tenure as prime minister, Brown and Bush do not share the close personal relationship that Bush enjoyed with Tony Blair. In addition, the recent violence in Basra, Iraq—where the United Kingdom is in the process of withdrawing some of its troops—has brought some friction to the U.S.-UK relationship. Some U.S. officials have expressed concern about the pace with which the United Kingdom has conducted that drawdown. Brown recently decided to slow down the withdrawal until the security situation has stabilized.\n\nQ3: What will be the most pressing agenda items for Brown and Bush?\n\nA3: Bush and Brown will discuss a long list of pressing foreign policy issues, most notably Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.\n\nThe Bush administration has specifically asked the United Kingdom to take over the NATO operation in southern Afghanistan and is waiting for an official response to that request. The two men will also focus on the current economic and banking crises that are affecting them both at home and abroad.\n\nFinally, Brown will be looking to turn the conversation to issues outside of the traditional security realm. For example, he continues to seek support from the Bush administration on climate change policies, particularly in regards to the creation of a post-Kyoto framework. Furthermore, Brown has been quite outspoken of late on the need to reform international institutions such as the United Nations and will likely raise this issue with President Bush. Transnational challenges such as poverty, global health issues, and failed states will also be on the prime minister’s agenda. Zimbabwe’s future after its recent election will likely come up as well.\n\nJulianne Smith directs the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nCritical Questions is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.
