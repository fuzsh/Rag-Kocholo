        "text": "In 1997, after 18 years in opposition and four successive general election defeats, the Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, won a landslide victory over the Conservatives: Labour won 418 seats and a 179-seat House of Commons majority and reduced the Conservatives to a rump of 165 MPs. Labour went on to win two successive victories. In 2001 it secured the largest-ever second-term majority (167 seats), and in 2005 it was returned again, though with a reduced majority of 66 seats.\n\nAfter 2003 Labour experienced a severe decline in its public standing, not least because of public unease with Blair’s role in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In October 2004 Blair announced that he would seek a third term as prime minister but would not stand for a fourth term. The likeliest successor was Brown, Blair’s chancellor of the Exchequer since 1997.\n\nBlair and Brown were at one time close partners in a battle to modernize the Labour Party (Brown reluctantly agreed to step aside in 1994 when Blair decided to seek the Labour Party leadership), but by 2005 their respective supporters appeared quite bitterly divided. Many loyal to Blair claimed that Brown’s supporters had been undermining Blair’s leadership for several years; indeed, in June 2007 a leaked document surfaced showing that Blair had considered removing Brown as chancellor of the Exchequer after the 2005 election. In September 2006, shortly after the Labour Party fared poorly in local elections, Blair announced that he would step down as prime minister within a year. Brown pledged his support for Blair, and Blair in turn later backed Brown to succeed him as Labour Party leader and prime minister. Brown faced no formal opposition in the campaign to succeed Blair as Labour Party leader, and on June 27, 2007, three days after he officially became Labour Party leader, Brown became prime minister.\n\nBrown and Labour initially got a bounce in the public opinion polls. Several incidents—within 48 hours of his taking office, two car bombs were placed in London, and a third vehicle was driven into Glasgow Airport; June floods brought a swift response from Brown in the shape of support for local councils and on flood defenses; and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was quickly contained—rallied support for the government and enhanced Brown’s reputation but overshadowed his attempts to present himself as a man with fresh ideas for the future. No longer trailing the Conservatives in the polls, Labour took the lead, tempting Brown to call a snap election in order to secure his own mandate, but a dramatic shift back to the Conservatives in September 2007 quelled such speculation. Brown’s flirtation with calling an election ended with an eventual decision that there would be no such election before 2009, crystallizing the sentiment among many that Brown dithered in making decisions. By December 2007 the Conservatives held a lead of about 13 percent in the polls—their largest lead since 1989.\n\nBrown’s claim to competent economic stewardship—in 1997 he had promised that the days of economic “boom and bust” were over—was undermined in 2008. His poll ratings suffered from a sharp decline in consumer confidence brought on, in large measure, from a steep drop in housing prices and an increase in inflation. There were murmurings of an internal leadership to challenge for the next election. But in September 2008 a global economic crisis brought a firm and steady response from Brown, for which the prime minister was widely praised. Labour’s standing recovered slightly, effectively forestalling any potential challenge to Brown. He rallied the party faithful at the party conference in Manchester in September 2008 with an exceptionally effective speech, the most memorable line of which was “This is no time for a novice.” The statement was ostensibly directed at David Cameron, the Conservatives’ relatively young and inexperienced leader.\n\nStill, Labour continued to trail the Conservatives, and on June 4, 2009, the party suffered a dismal national election result, securing only 15.7 percent of the vote across the British mainland in elections to the European Parliament. Immediately thereafter James Purnell, the secretary of state for work and pensions, resigned from Brown’s cabinet. In his resignation letter, Purnell wrote: “I now believe your continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more, not less likely.…I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our Party a fighting chance of winning.” Brown’s allies worked furiously to ensure that no other minister followed Purnell’s example. None did, but Brown’s authority was visibly weakened.\n\nLabour’s morale took a further hit in September 2009 when, just hours after Brown delivered his main speech to the party’s annual conference, The Sun—the country’s biggest-selling daily newspaper—announced that it was switching support from Labour to the Conservatives. To most observers, a Labour loss in 2010 appeared inevitable, and potential leadership challengers began positioning themselves for the postelection fight that would likely follow. Party insiders hoped that the fratricide that had followed Labour’s 1979 loss and led to 18 years in opposition would be avoided."
