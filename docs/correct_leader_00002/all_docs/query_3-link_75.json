        "text": "At an online meeting he discussed the challenges facing Newcastle - net-zero, poverty, levelling up and devolution.\n\nWatch what he had to say\n\nWho is Gordon Brown?\n\nMr Brown, who was the longest-serving Chancellor of the Exchequer in modern history, from 1997 to 2007. He became Prime Minster in 2007, succeeding Tony Blair, and remained in office until 2010 when he was defeated by David Cameron.\n\nWhat did he talk about?\n\nHe spoke at the event after accepting an invitation from the City Council.\n\nMr Brown said: “I was delighted to be speaking at a conference that focussed on all of the good things the city is doing to improve the quality of life for its citizens and how it can achieve even more.\n\n“I was pleased to join a discussion of some of the big challenges we face as a country. Newcastle has set itself an ambitious target to reach net zero by 2030 – a huge climate change challenge by anyone’s standards – but we must achieve it so we looked at how we can hit that target and be an example to other cities and towns.\n\n“After many years of fighting it, poverty is once again on the rise so we explored what we must do to help families struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and ensure every child has the best possible start in life.\n\n“The council has made its own levelling up bids to Government, securing funding for a new leisure centre, swimming pool and investment in the Grainger Market and Old Eldon Square – but I wanted to discuss what levelling up really means and whether it can really make a difference and if so, how does Newcastle position itself to take full advantage."
