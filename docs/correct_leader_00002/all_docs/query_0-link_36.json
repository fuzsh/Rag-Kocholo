        "text": "A new era in British politics was launched as Prime Minister Gordon Brown resigned and ceded his office to David Cameron, the leader of the British Conservative Party. Brown's resignation ends his Labor Party's 13-year rule and paves the way for Cameron and the third main candidate in the race for Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, to form a coalition government. This means Cameron's Conservatives and Clegg's Liberal Democrats will work together to rule Great Britain.\n\nCameron is the one moving into the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street because his party won more seats in Parliament than Clegg's. The two leaders are able to form a coalition government because together, their parties hold the majority of seats in Parliament. Clegg has been named Deputy Prime Minister, and Cameron has chosen five other members of the Liberal Democrats to be part of his ruling cabinet.\n\nClick here to view a video that provides more in-depth analysis of the election results.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"My constitutional duty is to make sure that a government can be formed following last Thursday's general election.
