        "text": "Why you should listen\n\nDuring his long term of office, former UK prime minister Gordon Brown became one of the world's most experienced political leaders, with a deep understanding of the global economy based on 10 years' experience as Great Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has been a key architect of the G8's agreements on poverty and climate change, and has provided a passionate voice to encourage the developed world to aid struggling African countries. He is an advocate of global solutions for global problems -- through both the reinvention of international institution and the advancement of a global ethics.\n\nWhile prime minister, Brown promoted technology as a tool for economic (and environmental) recovery. With his charge to \"count the carbon and the pennies,\" research on electric cars and residential energy efficiency are slated to become a major part of the UK's recovery plan. He pushed for universal broadband and a general increase in spending on science. And he sought to use new communication tools like Twitter and YouTube as a means to communicate government policy.\n\nWhat others say\n\n“Brown does not run from the image of the homme sérieux.” — New York Review of Books"
