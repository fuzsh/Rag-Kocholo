A series of spectacular market failures, most notably bank failure arising from undercapitalisation, caused in turn by ‘recklessness and irresponsibility all too often caused by greed’, has been presented to the reader as if Gordon Brown was a detached observer who could not have possibly previously been aware of the extent of risk-taking made possible by his own risk-based model of financial regulation.

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2This paper argues Gordon Brown’s analysis is fundamentally flawed. We are not now living through the first crisis of globalisation. On the contrary, what Gordon Brown has actually documented is the first crisis of his own deeply flawed British model of political economy, which socialised risks and privatized profits. This paper also explores how Gordon Brown’s attempts to modernize the politics and political economy of the United Kingdom, by constructing a new British model of political economy which used the City of London’s liberalized markets as a blueprint, has left the United Kingdom facing an age of austerity that was politically self-inflicted rather than financially imposed by external global market forces.\n\nThe British Model of Political Economy\n\n5Gordon Brown’s model also sought to transform the role of the Treasury, from being the chief institutional roadblock to British modernization, to becoming the prime mover of reform. Rather than following the examples of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan as Labour Party leaders, who had created new Whitehall ministries in the form of the Department of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Technology, and the National Enterprise Board to rival the Treasury and to give a greater institutional salience to the task of industrial modernization, Gordon Brown decided to make the Treasury itself the focal point and pilot agency of a British developmental state. Thus, in May 1999, in outlining the redefinition of the role of the Treasury under his stewardship, Gordon Brown identified the role of the Treasury as nothing less than the modernization of the British economy. Furthermore, he claimed that the Treasury had broken ‘decisively with the short-termist, secretive and unstable record of macroeconomic policy-making of the past two decades by setting a credible framework’ for monetary and fiscal policy.\n\n6Previous social democratic projects for British modernization had been based upon a critique of the efficacy of market forces. Indeed, the whole history of the British Labour Party as a party of social democratic reform had been founded upon its opposition to many of the adverse political, economic and social consequences of unfettered risk-taking and profit-seeking by free market capitalism. What made Gordon Brown’s modernization agenda so distinctive, and such a departure from the ideas, policies and institutional practices of ‘Old’ Labour was the degree to which it sought to harness the resources of liberalised financial markets.\n\nA Risk-Based Approach to Financial Governance\n\n11Following the precedent set by the Thatcher and Major Governments, it was assumed that modernization was best accomplished by a political economy in which open markets and a strong state would be ready to serve and defend the commercial and political interests of major transnational corporations, both at home and abroad. Globalization would also be harnessed by New Labour’s political rhetoric as an ideological weapon to account for and justify what were portrayed as necessary, unavoidable and urgent domestic economic and social reforms, whose totality would discipline and lower popular expectations of what the state could deliver. In this way, Gordon Brown’s British model of political economy would transfer the costs of significant areas of public welfare, notably pensions, away from the state, the general taxpayer and the corporation, on to the private individual.\n\n12At the heart of this model of macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence, the liberalized markets of the City of London were increasingly portrayed as a blueprint for how the United Kingdom could successfully engage with and compete in contemporary world markets. To protect the interests of the City, Brown created a new tripartite, ‘risk-based’ system of governance for London’s financial markets, in which the responsibility for financial governance and stability was divided between the Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Financial Services Authority (FSA), a new agency established by Gordon Brown. The FSA was eventually to employ 3 300 staff and be allocated a budget of £458 million (for 2010-2011), in order to regulate and protect the interests of the United Kingdom’s 29 000 financial services firms. No other sector of the economy was given such preferential attention.\n\nFrom Boom to Bust\n\n18Within less than three months of Brown having become Prime Minister, the City of London had experienced its first run on a domestic bank, Northern Rock, for 129 years, an event which would mark the onset of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Crash of October 1929, and the deepest recession since the 1930s. The Brown Boom had rapidly been replaced by the Brown Bust.\n\n19The disastrous political and economic dividend from Gordon Brown’s risk-based approach to financial market governance became apparent on 17th February 2008 when Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown’s successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer, revealed that Northern Rock would have to be taken into temporary public ownership. This costly blow to Gordon Brown’s British model of political economy was followed by another heavier blow on 8th October 2008, when Darling announced a further £500 billion of taxpayer support for the major United Kingdom banks which had previously been thought too big to fail.\n\n20Not even this unprecedented degree of public subsbidy was sufficient to alleviate the financial crisis. Two further rescue packages for the banks were announced by Alistair Darling on 14th and 19th January 2009 respectively before, on 20th February 2009, Alistair Darling revealed that £585 billion of assets from Lloyds, Halifax Bank of Scotland, and the Royal Bank of Scotland were being placed into a taxpayer guaranteed Asset Protection Scheme.\n\nA Legacy of Debt\n\n25The explosion in debt in the United Kingdom during the Brown years was not confined to public debt. Gordon Brown’s policies had encouraged financial innovation by major financial institutions, which meant that millions of Britons had been encouraged to borrow unprecedented amounts of money on their credit cards and in the form of personal loans to finance levels of personal consumption which their own incomes would never have been able to sustain. At the same time, Brown’s failure to regulate either the availability of private credit or the inflation in the property market had encouraged millions of people to take on extravagant levels of mortgage debt.\n\nBrown’s Mea Culpa\n\n30Gordon Brown has continued to insist that the world is living through the first crisis of globalisation. It is not. That event happened between August 1914 and November 1918. Nor is the world experiencing the first financial crisis of globalisation, because that event was the Great Depression which followed the Wall Street Crash of October 1929. In truth, what the world is experiencing is the first crisis of Gordon Brown and Alan Greenspan’s own risk-based model of financial deregulation.\n\n31It should not be forgotten that Gordon Brown had articulated the need to rediscover public purpose in the global economy in an earlier speech at Havard University on 15th December 1998. Subsequently, from September 1999, Brown had chaired the International Monetary Fund’s International Monetary and Financial Committee, which had been charged with advising the IMF’s Board of Governors on the supervision of ‘the management and adaptation of the international monetary system, and dealing with sudden disturbances that might threaten the stability of the system’. In short, in the twelve year period between his two great speeches at Harvard University, where he had identified the limitations of liberalized global financial markets, Gordon Brown had possessed the opportunity and major public offices to put those principles into practice. He chose instead to become, with Alan Greenspan, the champion of a ‘risk-based’ model of financial governance. Both the United Kingdom and the global economy are now paying the huge economic, political and social cost for that error of judgement.\n\nConclusion\n\n33At the May 2010 General Election, not only did Labour lose office after thirteen years in power but, in winning only 8.6 million votes and only 29.0 per cent of the votes, the party recorded its lowest share of the vote at a General Election since 1945, with the sole exception of 1983, when it had won 27.6 per cent of UK votes. Where Tony Blair’s New Labour project had delivered an unprecedented three consecutive General Election victories for the Labour Party, Gordon Brown’s British Way has led to electoral humiliation."
