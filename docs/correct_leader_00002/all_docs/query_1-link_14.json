        "text": "10 July 2024\n\nBy Tom Edgington & Jennifer Clarke , BBC News\n\nSir Keir Starmer became the prime minister after Labour won the 4 July general election.\n\nHe is the third prime minister of King Charles' reign and the first Labour prime minister since Gordon Brown left office in 2010.\n\nWhat does the prime minister do and how are they appointed?\n\nThe prime minister leads the government.\n\nThey may be the leader of the party that wins a general election, who is then called to Buckingham Palace and invited by the monarch to form a new government.\n\nBut a ruling party can also select a new prime minister without a general election.\n\nUltimately, the prime minister is responsible for all government policy and decisions, although some powers have been devolved to administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThey choose the other members of the government, known as ministers.\n\nThe most senior figures are called cabinet ministers. They lead government departments - such as the Treasury and Home Office.\n\nThe prime minister can, at any time, hire and fire ministers. They can also abolish government departments or create new ones.\n\nAlongside the chancellor, the prime minister is in charge of tax-and-spending policy.\n\nThe prime minister and their ministers can also bring in new laws - as long as they are backed by Parliament.\n\nWhat other powers does the prime minister have?\n\nThe prime minister has overall control of the civil service - the people and departments that carry out government's decisions.\n\nThey usually have a weekly meeting with the King to brief him on government matters. These meetings are private and there is no official record of what is said.\n\nThe prime minister also makes decisions about the UK's defence and security.\n\nFor example, they have the power to send the UK's armed forces into action. However, recent convention says Parliament should also approve such a move, where possible.\n\nA number of special responsibilities also rest on the prime minister's shoulders, such as deciding whether to shoot down a hijacked or unidentified aircraft in UK airspace.\n\nThey can also authorise the use of the UK's nuclear weapons.\n\nMany honours, such as knighthoods and damehoods, are put forward by the PM.\n\nThey can also recommend peerages - where someone becomes a member of the House of Lords.\n\nHow much does the prime minister earn and where do they live?\n\nThe prime minister is entitled to two salaries:\n\n£91,346 for being an MP\n\n£80,807 for being PM - although only £75,440 is claimed\n\nThe prime minister traditionally lives and works at 10 Downing Street - which has been the office of the prime minister since 1735.\n\nHowever, some recent prime ministers - including former Tory PM Boris Johnson - have chosen to reside in Number 11 as it has a larger living area.\n\nIn addition, the prime minister has an official country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire.\n\nOwned by the Chequers Trust, the 16th-Century manor house has an indoor swimming pool and sits in hundreds of acres of grounds.\n\nIt is used to entertain official guests and regularly hosts cabinet awaydays.\n\nHow are prime ministers held to account?\n\nDespite their powers, prime ministers cannot just take any decision they like.\n\nThey need to retain the confidence of most MPs. That is because laws can only be passed if a majority of MPs vote them through.\n\nIf a government repeatedly loses votes, MPs can choose to call a \"motion of no confidence\".\n\nIf a prime minister loses such a vote, they face the prospect of a general election."
