        "meta_description": "Hello and Welcome to Dijon, the Capital of the Burgundy region of France. You’re probably thinking, Dijon? I didn’t know there was anything in Dijon but mustard, or Burgundy, where’s that? Well the answer is: there is so much more to Dijon than mustard, so I am going to show you some of the highlights of this beautiful, historically rich city, including the history of Dijon mustard, and some other surprises. \r\n\r\nMy name is Kelly and I am an expatriate American who has been living in the Dijon area for over 25 years. My background is in archaeology and art history and I have been a licensed tour guide since 2012, Burgundy by the way is a great place to be a guide!\r\n\r\nYou should be standing at the entrance gate to the Palace of the Dukes.\r\n\r\nWe shall only have time for a glimpse of the architectural treasures that comprise the historic center of Dijon. In fact, Dijon has 97 hectares of protected area (about 230 acres), so you’ll have to visit the rest yourself but this tour is a good start, but let’s not waste time.\r\n\r\nWe'll be spending a few moments here in front of the Palace of the Dukes - make sure you find a spot where you can take in the entire building.\r\n\r\nThis is the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy, or the Mairie which is the City Hall. Behind you is a semi-circular place called Place de la Libération. I like to begin a visit here because for me, the history of Dijon was written in the building you see before you; every period has made an addition, a change or a modification, but in spite of that, there is still a feeling of harmony and coherence to the whole structure.\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, Dijon was known as Divio, it was a market town near the main communication and trade routes. Walls were built around the town in the third century when the Roman Empire started becoming unstable. This third century fortification wall followed more or less the orientation of the building you see today. \r\n\r\nIf you look from left to right, you can follow its line. Looking left you see up the rue de la Liberté, looking right, you can see the church of Saint Michel, a gothic Church with a Renaissance façade. The wall turned south in front of where the church is today, but obviously the church wasn’t there in antiquity, We are inside what would have been the former Roman castrum called Divio. The oldest part of the Palace that you can see from where you’re standing is the tower, known either as La Tour de la Terrace or as the Tower of Philip the Good or Philippe le Bon in French. He was the third in the Valois dynasty of dukes. It was under these Dukes - Philip the Bold, John the Fearless, Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, but I prefer Rash, that the city of Dijon and the region of Burgundy were at their apogee.\r\n\r\nThe Valois dukes of Burgundy were great patrons of the arts and fine food and dining - including high quality wines from Burgundy which were already famous and sought after in the Middle Ages. Dijon was the capital of their duchy - although they preferred living on their lands in Flanders, in modern day Belgium. When the last duke, Charles the Rash died in 1477 trying to achieve the dynastic dream of becoming the empire or the kingdom of Burgundy, the duchy reverted back to the king, who at that time was Louis XI. The ducal palace became the king’s residence, not that he lived here of course, but it stood as the symbol of royal power in the newly acquired province. \r\n\r\nThe province was ruled by governors and the States of Burgundy. In the seventeenth century, Louis XIV wanted to update the palace by decking it out in more a current architectural fashion. He asked his architect, Jules Hardouin Mansard to refurbish it. Mansard pasted a typical 17th century façade on the 15th century building and added the Mansard roofs. At the same time another royal architect, Martin de Noinville, created the space behind you, which at that time was a Place Royale or Royal Place. The idea was  the square or place served as a decorative context specifically designed to highlight a statue of the king. These places were usually quiet, peaceful spots for strolling. Don’t bother looking for the statue today, but  there was one once. An artist called Étienne le Hongre, who did some work at Versailles, Fontainebleau and other royal residences, cast an enormous bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV, but it was so big and so heavy that it took 27 years to arrive in Dijon and several more years to create its base. It was finally inaugurated in 1725, but was melted down during the revolution in 1789 to make canons. This place got a name change during the revolution and was known as Place d’armes, Arms Place and today it is called Place de la Libération.\r\n\r\nNow turn back around and look at the wing of the palace that stretches to the left. This wing was added by the States-General of Burgundy in the 18th century. At that time, the States-General, made up of nobles, members of the clergy and the people, needed meeting and reception rooms.\r\n\r\nIf you look to the right, you’ll see the east wing built in the 19th century to house the collection of the School of Fine Arts founded in a century before. Today it houses our richly endowed Museum of Fine Arts, worth a visit if only for the unique works of art from the time of the dukes. The building still represents the power of the city as it houses the city hall, the municipal archives and the museum, of course.\r\n\r\nBefore we get going, let me briefly explain how VoiceMap works.\r\n\r\nIt uses your location to play audio automatically at the right time and place. This means you can put your phone away. There will be occasional periods of silence, but this is normal. If you're unsure where to go, you can always take a look at the map on your screen, and if you wander too far off track, VoiceMap will let you know.\r\n\r\nSo, let's get going.\r\n\r\nNow, lets' move on to your next stop. With your back to the palace, turn right and start walking along the main street of Dijon known as rue de la Libérté. I'll meet you further along the street.",
