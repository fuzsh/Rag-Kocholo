        "text": "This edited article about the Hundred Years War first appeared in Look and Learn issue number 497 published on 24 July 1971.\n\nIt was 7.30 in the evening and the shoemaker’s wife was in a bad temper. Her child was tired and her husband was late. She opened the window and peered crossly down the Vieille Rue du Temple to see if he was coming and lifted in some bedclothes which she had been airing on a pole outside. She was about to close the window when she heard the ring of hooves on the cobbles. A nobleman on horseback entered the street accompanied by half a dozen outriders and footmen with torches; he was singing softly to himself and toying idly with a glove. The shoemaker’s wife snorted, slammed the casement shut and began to make up her child’s bed. Suddenly there were shouts of “Kill him! kill him!” She rushed back to the window – and froze.\n\nThe nobleman had been dragged from his horse and was ringed by masked men who hacked at him and at his bodyguards with swords and axes, while the harsh light from the flaring torches sent grotesque shadows sprawling across the walls around them. The shoemaker’s wife screamed. “Shut up! you stupid woman,” growled one of the attackers. “Shut up!” She stopped abruptly, terrified. Then, from the shadows of the house opposite, a man stepped forward, his face hidden by a red hood. “He’s dead,” he told the assassins, “Let’s go.” The men vanished and the street was silent save for the hissing and spluttering of a dying torch as it rolled among the inert bodies. It was 23rd November, 1407, and hired assassins of the Duke of Burgundy had murdered Louis, Duke of Orleans, brother of the king of France.\n\nBetween 1380 and 1415 the war between England and France had fallen into an uneasy truce broken only by garrison warfare and piracy. Both sides had been convulsed by internecine struggles and had neither the inclination nor the resources to fight each other. Edward III of England had been succeeded in 1377 by his 12-year-old grandson. Richard II. The young king’s reign ended in disaster when he was deposed by his cousin, John of Gaunt’s son, Henry IV. Henry in turn was at first more preoccupied with consolidating his position at home than with fighting abroad. It was not until the end of his reign that he was able to look covetously at France. He found her ailing, ruled in name only by a hapless king, exploited by grasping nobles and ravaged by civil war.\n\nCharles VI had acceded to the throne of France in 1380. Twelve years later he began to go mad and a bitter conflict broke out between the two most powerful magnates in France, John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis, Duke of Orleans, the king’s brother, for control of the sick king. Burgundy assiduously built up support amongst the people of France, in particular amongst the Parisians, and by 1407 he believed he was strong enough to strike down his rival. Thus it was that his agent, the man in the red hood, laid an ambush in the Rue du Temple and Orleans was battered to death.\n\nSuspicion did not at first fall on Burgundy. Orleans had an unsavoury reputation and people guessed that some knight whom he had wronged in the past had taken a bloody revenge. But when the provost of Paris began his investigation of the murder, the evidence began to point to John the Fearless. He fled from Paris with a handful of companions and was soon safe in his own domains. But he did not stay a fugitive for long for it was precisely to meet this situation that he had built up a following in Paris and beyond. Soon his representatives had drawn up a justification of the assassination. “It is permissible and meritorious to kill a tyrant,” it began. “The Duke of Orleans was a tyrant; therefore the Duke of Burgundy did well to kill him.” After long and tortuous negotiations Burgundy was reconciled with the king, the dauphin and the court. Soon afterwards he made a triumphant entry into Paris; the citizens thronged the streets to cheer him and that night bonfires were lit throughout the city. Burgundy was master of France.\n\nHe quickly set about removing from office members of the rival faction. One of the first to go was Jean de Montaigu, the short, sharp-tongued, civil servant who was in charge of the royal finances. He was arrested, imprisoned, then, clad in his red and white livery, clutching a wooden cross in his manacled hands, he was taken in a tumbril to Les Halles, the great market-place of Paris. He was beheaded there, his head impaled on a lance and his headless corpse padlocked to a gallows so that it could not be removed for decent burial.\n\nBut while Burgundy filled the offices of state with his own men, his enemies re-grouped. They were joined by the Armagnacs from the south, who gave their name to the anti-Burgundy faction. Eventually fighting broke out again in Paris between the two groups in 1411 and 1412 and in 1413, John the Fearless lost his grip on the capital and galloped out through its gates, a fugitive once more.\n\nThe war between the factions now spread into north-eastern France and dragged on desultorily until late in 1414 when negotiations for peace began. But while they haggled over terms, the leaders of the two sides were both surreptitiously courting the same ally – England. Henry IV had successively assisted both sides, at their invitation, during the fighting of 1411 and 1412. His son Henry V, inheriting an impoverished but now relatively stable kingdom, realised that the time was ripe for a more forceful intervention and began to build up England’s military strength once more while he courteously entertained Burgundian and Armagnac envoys and played the two sides off against each other. Peace between the two parties had only just been settled and they were still quibbling over details when the inevitable news came. Henry V of England had landed with his army in France and was besieging the town of Harfleur. The war had entered a new phase."
