        "text": "Louis XIV is officially the longest reigning monarch in world history. His reign lasted from May 14, 1643 until September 1, 1715, a total of over 72 years. His great grandson inherited the throne and his reign lasted more than 58 years, finishing with his death from smallpox in 1774.\n\nFOUR GENERATIONS OF LOUIS’\n\nIt is believed this portrait of Louis XIV, his son Louis the “Grand Dauphin”, grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy and great grandson the future Louis XV was commissioned by Madame de Ventadour who is featured.*\n\nMadame de Ventadour was a duchess who was a friend of Madame de Maintenon and had been given the prestigious role of governess** of the royal children when Louis XIV’s first great grandchild was born. Eight years later an outbreak of measles claimed the lives of Louis XIV’s grandson and his wife. Their sons were also infected. The elder son, who was five, had become the heir to the French throne. The doctors were preoccupied with saving him.\n\nMadame de Ventadour observed their treatment, which included bleeding him, had severely weakened the child and he died. She was determined the surviving two year old would not suffer the same fate and removed him from their care. In so doing, she saved his life.\n\nShe became a mother figure to him and he called her “Maman Ventadour”. She took care of him until he turned seven, the age when boys were traditionally turned over to be educated by men. She was seated in pride of place for his coronation and later “Maman” was well into her sixties when she was made governess of Louis XV’s own children.\n\nFAMILY TREE LOUIS XIV TO LOUIS XV\n\nLouis XIV and his cousin Queen Marie-Thérèse had six children. Only the eldest, Louis, survived to adulthood. Louis XIV organised his son’s marriage to his second cousin Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nLouis became known as the “Grand Dauphin” on the birth of his eldest son, also called Louis. The couple had two other sons, ensuring the dynasty, or so they thought.\n\nLouis XIV’s eldest grandson married Marie-Adelaide of Savoy. Everyone, especially Louis XIV and his wife Madame de Maintenon, loved the lively 12 year old. She gave birth to three sons, two of whom survived. King Louis XIV was a proud great grandfather with the Bourbon dynasty assured.\n\nSuddenly everything changed. The “Grand Dauphin”, Louis XIV’s 49 year old son and heir to the throne died of smallpox. Less than twelve months later Marie-Adelaide caught measles and passed it on to her husband and two sons. Marie-Adelaide and Louis died within six days of each other and were buried together. Their eldest son and new heir to the throne also died of measles within another month. The 73 year old Louis XIV’s sole surviving heir was his two year old great grandson.\n\nWhen Louis XIV died three years later, the five year old became Louis XV.\n\n*This portrait is part of the Wallace Collection in London. It is also suggested that Mme de Ventadour commissioned the painting when all the people portrayed were still alive and the child was the older brother of Louis XV. She is in mourning for her mother who died in 1709.\n\n**The position put her in charge of a large staff dedicated to each royal child."
