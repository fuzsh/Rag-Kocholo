        "text": "Twenty-eight-year-old Louis, in a move to consolidate his crown, resolves to establish his seat of power outside Paris by moving his court to his father's former hunting lodge at the Palace of Versailles, on the outskirts of of the capital.\n\nBy removing the nobles of Paris there, he is able to keep them under control. At the palace, the aristocrats are expected to compete for the privilege of watching Louis XIV wake up, eat meals and prepare for bed while the King satisfies his many appetites. But who was Louis XIV?\n\nLouis XIV of France, king of kings\n\nBorn on September 5, 1638, Louis was christened Louis-Dieudonné, meaning 'gift of God' and became king at the age of four upon the death of his father, Louis XIII (1601-1643).\n\nHe reigned for 72 years and 110 days until his death on September 1, 1715, longer than that of any other known European sovereign.\n\nDuring his reign Louis transformed the monarchy, ushered in a golden age of art and literature, presided over a dazzling royal court at Versailles, annexed key territories and established his country as the dominant power on the continent until the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted from 1701 to 1714.\n\nCivil war made Louis XIV paranoid\n\nThe early years of Louis’s reign, Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin consolidated the monarchy’s power with policies that enraged nobles and members of the aristocracy.\n\nIn 1648, a civil war known as 'The Fronde' (named after the slings used to smash windows) broke out and the royal family was forced to flee Paris.\n\nMazarin managed to quell the uprising in 1653 and by the end of the decade had restored order and negotiated a peace treaty with Hapsburg Spain, making France a leading European power.\n\nThe Fronde shaped young Louis' outlook for the rest of his life and he would never get over his fear of rebellion.\n\nLouis XIV assumes control of France\n\nAfter Mazarin’s death in 1661, Louis XIV broke with centuries-old tradition and declared he would rule France without a chief minister.\n\nLouis is often remembered for statement “L’État, c’est moi” (“I am the State”).\n\nHis rule was a divine right and he would go on to wield the absolute power of the monarchy, a power that would endure until the French Revolution in 1789.\n\nWhere is the the Palace of Versailles?\n\nVersailles was built on the site of a hunting lodge in the French countryside between 1661 and 1710. It is located 12 miles south-west of Paris.\n\nLouis engaged the greatest architects of the day, Louis Le Vaux and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, to build him a suitable residence.\n\nAndré Le Nôtre designed the grounds, including the Grand Canal outside the windows and a forest studded with glades containing classical statues and fountains.\n\nLouis transplanted his court there in 1682 and made it the centre of government in which 60,000 people eventually lived.\n\nLouis also had a number of public affairs. His first serious mistress was Marie Mancini between 1657 to 1660. She was the niece of Mazarin.\n\nBetween 1661 to 1667 his mistress was Louise de la Valliere with whom he had four children.\n\nLouis XIV’s third major mistress was Athenais de Montespan with whom he had seven children.\n\nLouis XIV was a great lover of art...\n\n...as well as literature, music, theatre and sport. Some of the greatest artistic and intellectual figures of the time were members of his retinue including the painter Charles Le Brun (1619-1690), the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687) and Molière (1622-1673) the playwright.\n\nHe was also a patron of the Académie Française, the body that regulates the French language, and established various institutes of arts and sciences.\n\nLouis XIV's foreign policy was aggressive...\n\nWar of Devolution (1667-1668)\n\nEarly in his reign, Louis invaded the Spanish Netherlands, which he claimed as his wife’s inheritance.\n\nUnder pressure from England, Sweden and the Dutch, France retreated and returned the region to Spain, gaining only some frontier towns in Flanders. This unsatisfactory outcome led to the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678).\n\nLouis also seized territory from the Native American people and sent Frenchmen to live on their land, which he re-named Louisiana after himself.\n\nIn the late 1680s they and several smaller countries formed a coalition known as the Grand Alliance to counteract France's dominant position in Europe.\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714)\n\nSpain's King Charles II ruled a an empire which comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II unexpectedly changed his will and offered the entire empire to the Louis XIV's grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou who he thought would be able to keep the Spanish empire intact.\n\nThis angered France's enemies and the aging king was forced to defend Philip V’s inheritance. Famine-ridden France was plunged into a disastrous war causing huge debt, and turned public opinion against the crown.\n\nLouis XIV angers Protestants everywhere\n\nIn 1685, the devoutly Catholic king revoked the Edict of Nantes, issued by his grandfather Henry IV in 1598, which had granted freedom of worship and other rights to French Protestants (known as Huguenots).\n\nWith the Edict of Fontainebleau Louis ordered the destruction of Protestant churches, the closure of Protestant schools and the expulsion of Protestant clergy.\n\nProtestants would be prohibited from assembling and their marriages would be anulled. Baptism and education in the Catholic faith would be required of all children.\n\nRoughly one million Huguenots lived in France at the time, and many were artisans or other types of skilled workers.\n\nAlthough emigration of Protestants was explicitly forbidden by the Edict, scores of people—estimates range from 200,000 to 800,000 - fled in the decades that followed, settling in England, Switzerland, Germany and the American colonies, among other places.\n\nLouis XIV actions cost France a valuable segment of its labour force while drawing the ire of its Protestant neighbors.\n\nLouis XIV's death\n\nFour days before he turned 77, on September 1, 1715, Louis died of gangrene at Versailles. His five-year-old grandson succeeded him as Louis XV. All of his intermediate heirs had died before him."
