        "text": "By the third quarter of the tenth century, relations between the archbishops of Sens and their viscounts had badly deteriorated. As I have mentioned in a previous post, after the death of Archbishop Archembald in 967 his successor Anastasius couldn’t get access to the city itself in order to be consecrated, and King Lothar eventually ordered him consecrated in a small estate on the road from Auxerre instead. Ten years later, on Anastasius’ death, things had not improved dramatically. The new candidate, Seguin, was the nephew of Sens’ count Rainald the Old, but alliance did not follow from kinship and Rainald refused to let Seguin into Sens. (Notably, this time they apparently didn’t bother trying to get Seguin consecrated in Sens itself and the consecration ceremony had taken place in Auxerre.) Seguin responded by bringing out the big guns: he ordered an interdict on the city to be in place until Ash Wednesday 978. (And, for a bit of behind-the-scenes insight, that was going to be the 977 Charter A Week until it turned out the manuscript tradition was more complicated than I had realised and that some key sections were later interpolations… This is one reason you ended up with a different excommunication instead.) This worked: Seguin was allowed into Sens in February 978. Then, a few weeks later, this happened:\n\nSaint-Cyr, no. 4 = ARTEM, no. 1863\n\nAlthough consideration of the state and religion of Holy Mother Church is the common practice of all Christians living in whatever grade and form, nonetheless its care looms larger over the rule of bishops, who, once the pastoral staff has been given to them, have been placed in the place of Peter, to whom God committed his sheep and lambs to be fed, and of the other apostles and should astutely protect the sheepfold of the Church from the attack of secret enemies. And because ‘the days of man are short’, and the Apostle proclaims ‘hurry, wretch, whilst ye have time, lest ye fall to death’, the care, state and religion of the Church should be supported and sustained by them as much as they know the ravening wolf, ‘who walketh about, seeking whom he may devour’, to lie in wait for their sheep. The Ancient Serpent, indeed, rages against the Church in many and innumerable ways, but he afflicts it with one particularly criminal and damnable custom, when he compels pastors, allured by his greed, either to steal the Church’s lands for another, or irrecoverably transfer them into another’s dominion. When want and penury arises, the afflicted ministers of the Church, that is, canons and monks and the order of nuns as well, and other servants of the Church, are scattered amongst the crowd, and know their state, which they cannot maintain when they are deprived of their rights, is little by little reduced to nothing. If, though, any successor (in a better spirit) restores the loss of this diminution, let them far from doubt know that they will receive the reward of heavenly repayment in future.\n\nWherefore, let it be known to all of the faithful of the Church, present and future, that Natrand, by God’s will bishop of the church of Nevers, having from the first time of his consecration inspected the various hardships and wants of the church committed to him, partly arising from persecution by pagans and bad Christians, partly from the innate sinfulness of his ancestors, beheld – amongst other things – the state of his canons, which seemed to him to be the worst, being diminished and disturbed to such a point that none of them could take from the church’s resources enough to be bound and constrained by the bishop and prelates to the divine office, except at will. The same pastor, greatly weeping over this loss, infused with divine inspirationand having taken counsel with his followers, gave as a supplement to the rations of the canons of Saint-Cyr the altars of certain churches, with tithes and offerings and everything pertaining to them, which also used to be the canons’ benefices, and they are in the district of Nivernais, and one of them is seen to be in honour of St Medard and in the estate of Arzembouy, another, in honour of St Vincent, is sited in the estate of Prie; a third, consecrated in honour of St Stephen, is in the estate of Sauvigny; and a fourth (after the death of Ralph, archdeacon of this church) is from the church of Parigny-les-Vaux, consecrated in honour of St Julian. The same bishop also gave to the aforesaid canons a certain allod left to him by his kinsman Antidius, sited in the same district of Nivernais and in the estate of Poiseux, that is, a close attaching to it, with land and a meadow and a wood; and whatever Antidius once left to him, and he later bought from his almsmen, he left to the canons to be perpetually possessed.\n\nThen, having sincerely made this donation and corroborated it by a written testament, the pastor imposed this law and condition on the canons by the highest interdict that they should never give or sell or come to an arrangement concerning anything from the said churches and land to any of their people using the excuse of benefice and of any oppression; rather, they should have and possess them in perpetual right for the stipends of their victuals, and each synod they should pay as vestiture 4 pennies from each to the holy mother church; and on the day when the bishop’s passing comes, having celebrated and sang the offices of vigils and masses for his soul in the church with the greatest of effort (as is customary) they should have a common feast in the refectory from the resources of these churches, and afterwards they should assiduously ask God and St Cyric for the souls of him and all his successors, and (if possible) do the same for themselves.\n\nThe bishop prohibited with a great public prayer and interdiction that any successor of his, or any other person, should dare to take anything of the aforesaid goods away from the canons. If they do this, may they remain damned by the wrath of God Almighty, and have his part with Dathan and Abiron, and with those who said to Lord God, ‘depart from us, we do not wish to know thy ways’.\n\nBut that this authority might be supported by greater firmness, not only did the aforesaid pontiff give it to be authorised and confirmed by his hand, but also by the hands of the archbishops and fellow bishops of the province, who are listed by name. May it be a defence from every trick of calumniators and rivals.\n\nEnacted in the castle of Dijon.\n\nNatrand, sinner and humble bishop. Seguin, archbishop of the holy church of Sens, subscribed. Gibuin, bishop of the church of Châlons, subscribed. Adalbero, bishop of the church of Laon, subscribed. Liudolf, called bishop of the church of Noyon, subscribed. Widric, bishop of the church of Langres, subscribed. Ralph, bishop of the church of Chalon, subscribed.\n\nMainer the levite wrote this on behalf of Dean Diether, before the king’s presence, and gave it in the month of March, in the 32nd year of the reign of King Lothar.\n\nI know I keep banging on about this, but I refuse to stop banging on about this until the point gets through: the alleged weakness of tenth-century kings is apparent, not real. We know that, for instance, Charles the Bald had a major presence in Burgundy because we have rich and detailed narrative sources such as the Annals of Saint-Bertin and the Translation of St Germanus of Auxerre.* We don’t have anything like that for the tenth century – well, we sort of do, but the Chronicle of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif is a) much less well-known and b) not a contemporary source – but we have, in this charter, proof that the late tenth-century kings’ presence in Burgundy was also a significant one. Here we can see Lothar holding court in Dijon attended not just by usual suspects like the bishops of Châlons, Laon, and Noyon, but by major Burgundian figures such as the bishops of Sens, Langres, Chalon, and Nevers.\n\nThat’s a lot of burden to put on one document, admittedly. However, we can offer two counterpoints to that: first, it’s not just one document. As I noted, we’re putting this in a context where even with our surviving source base we can see the crew of powerful bishops around Lothar on other occasions – and, indeed, Lothar’s presence in Burgundy was probably directly related to the appointment of one of them. The chronological coincidence between Seguin’s arrival in the city of Sens and Lothar’s presence in Burgundy is unlikely to be, erm, coincidental. Rather, I think Lothar is likely to have been present in the region in order to give some muscle to Seguin, whom I view as a royal ally like his two predecessors.\n\nSecond, attendance on a king is not a small matter. Kings expect gifts, kings expect obedience, they expect you to provide soldiers for, say, an upcoming attack on Lotharingia. Being good prelates who read their Augustine, the Burgundian bishops would have been quite familiar with the bishop of Hippo’s dictum regarding the similarities between kings and bandits. The main reason to associate with a king was to get something out of the association, whether that was material gain, increased status, or the warm glowy feeling that came from fulfilling a self-perceived duty. One does not show up at court for the lols or the novelty value. In short, evidence that such-and-such a magnate was at court once is evidence that they had some kind of familiarity with it more generally. Thus, we can say with some confidence that one attestation of the presence of the southern Burgundian bishops in court implies more than one actual visit. (And indeed in the case of Chalon we can find some non-existent evidence bearing this out!) For tenth-century history, no source is just incidental.\n\n*My suspicion is that it also helps that most of the big, chunky, ninth-century sources are available in easy-to-access, relatively low-cost English translations; and although the provision of translated tenth-century sources for the West Frankish kingdom is good and in fact is much better now than when I started working in the field over a decade ago (even without my own efforts, which are by now substantial), most of the real stuff you need to deal with the period in depth is too fragmentary and niche to get even a modern edition, let alone an English translation. We don’t even have an English version of Adhemar of Chabannes!\n\nOne of the main, if not the single most significant, thing I talk about on this blog is the ideological use of charters, and particularly of charter texts. You can go to the Translated Texts index and find almost two hundred documents which I have analysed to within an inch of their lives. Yet, in general, these documents come from the very highest levels of society. We might reasonably expect that the king, or the duke of Aquitaine, or the bishop of Langres, would have access to the intellectual resources needed to write up charters of staggering ideological complexity, responding to both the pressures of the moment and the underpinning discourses about rule which they wished to propagate, respond to, and alter. But what about Joe Schmoe? (Or, at least, people who weren’t at the top of the tree – if not Joe Schmoe, at least Joseph Schmoe, Esq…)\n\nThe lords of Brancion, in the northern Mâconnais, are a particularly cool set of local elites because they got lucky, historiographically speaking. Last time I did one of these, I was excited because we had four whole pieces of evidence to describe the career of a man called Evrebert. The lords of Brancion, though, just happened to live right next to the abbey of Cluny, and thus to its unusually good (and multifariously sourced) archive. What this means is that we can see the way the family rolled over time and – right at the beginning of its appearances in our sources – we can see how they used charters to navigate some choppy political waters.\n\nThe very first member of this family, Warulf I, is little known, although we have actually met him: he was one of the witnesses to the charter whereby Abbess Ava granted William the Pious Cluny itself back in 893. This was all well and good. Ava was surrounded by the leading figures of the subregion, and Warulf was definitely a close ally of hers. However, over the next few decades, the situation in Burgundy changed. The previously minor count of Autun, Richard the Justiciar, dramatically expanded his power-base, and by the end of Charles the Simple’s reign, the family of his leading ally was ruling at Chalon, just north of the region around Cluny and Brancion. At the same time, William the Pious and his successor William the Younger were embattled both by the dukes of Burgundy and by the Robertians. They both made a reasonable job of fighting back, but still, the situation was tense. What was a family of regional nobles to do?\n\nThe family of Brancion had an ace up their sleeve. Warulf I had two sons, Warulf II and Leotbald, and apparently they each chose to back a different horse, presumably to ensure that whoever held regional predominance at that particular moment would have a member of that family in their councils. On one hand, Leotbald stayed attached to the Guillelmid network of power. He was one of the most important patrons of early Cluny, and when he gave land he did so explicitly for the souls of the Guillelmid rulers. In 926, a charter described him explicitly and unusually as a ‘vassal of Count William [the Younger]’. Even people called a ‘vassal’ don’t normally make their allegiance clear in written documents like this. It is therefore interesting that the closest analogy is none other than Leotbald’s brother Warulf II. He appears outside the Cluny archives, in the cartulary of Saint-Marcel-lès-Chalon, seeking land from Count Gilbert of Chalon – and he is called ‘Count Gilbert’s vassal’ in the document.\n\nThe fact that Warulf and Leotbald had different lords did not meant they were a house divided. We can see in Leotbald’s charters that Warulf frequently acted as a witness to his brother’s acts, and indeed Leotbald’s gifts were frequently for Warulf’s soul. (We might have more evidence of activity in the other direction except that evidence from the Chalon region is very poor – the Saint-Marcel charter I mentioned above is almost the only private document from the first, say, two-thirds of the tenth century to have survived…) The brothers and their families were evidently close, and thus we can reasonably infer that they could have co-ordinated to work out a family strategy.\n\nI think the titulature deployed by the Cluniac and Saint-Marcel scribes isn’t an undirected choice of the charters’ composers, but reflects the input of the Brancion family themselves. That both brothers chose to take the unusual tack of proclaiming their political allegiances to the Great Powers on either side of their region suggests to me a kind of performative loyalty, an intensified display of vassalage to compensate for the fact that the family was so clearly dividing its eggs between different baskets. This isn’t to say that the Brancion boys dictated the charter – any document is going to reflect the input of all the parties involved to greater or lesser extents – but here the titulature does make me think that these traces are of an ideological strategy at the local level.\n\nYou don’t need to worry about the family’s ultimate fate, by the way. Once Cluny started attracting big-league donors after the 930s, their presence in the sources fades out noticeably and is never as visible, or frankly as interesting, as it is in the 920s. Nonetheless, they remained big cheeses in the area. Ultimately, at the end of the tenth century, Warulf II’s son Leotbald would become bishop of Mâcon, reigning for over twenty years. As far as familial outcomes go, I can think of a lot worse.\n\nAs I mentioned last time, the mid-970s are the driest of dry zones for political history. In the absence of a Flodoard, or even the jerry-rigged framework provided by the combination of Richer of Rheims and Gerbert of Aurillac, we are left to piece things together from undated episodes in later chronicles, the odd annal reference, and the charters. This is often frustrating. In this case, for example, we can see that in 974, probably around Christmas, Lothar held a summit meeting at Compiègne with his Capetian cousins Hugh Capet and Henry of Burgundy, along with Abbot Richard of Fleury. However, working out what the issues at stake were is much trickier. So, rather than present an overarching thesis this week, I’m just going to take you through each of the diplomas and give you some context for them.\n\nFirst of all, the calmest:\n\nD LL5, no. 35 (974, Compiègne)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLothar, with divine clemency propitious king of the Franks.\n\nIf We favour the just and reasonable petitions of servants of God for love of divine worship, We faithfully believe that We will be remunerated by the Lord with the prize of worthy retribution.\n\nTherefore, let the skill of all Our followers both present and future know that the venerable duke of Burgundy [Odo-]Henry, approaching Our presence, brought to Our ears that the monks of the monastery of the holy virgin and martyr of Christ Columba, in which the entombed bodies of she and the holy confessor Christ Lupus are venerated, had a precept of the most pious augustus Louis [the Pious] of good memory concerning the royal forest which is by the river Yonne not far from the town of Sens; but the same monastery was englobed in burning fire and they lost the same authority with many of the church’s other ornaments. For the confirmation of the matter, the aforesaid Duke Henry asked Us that, for reverence of the said saints and the fruit of eternal repayment, We might concede a paternal authority.\n\nFreely assenting to his petition, We concede that forest to the same monastery, that is, from the place which is called Le Chapeau up to the estate of Doilly , as is contained in the authority of the most pious lord augustus Louis. And We command and order that no public judge or any person of any power at all should dare to disturb the monks dwelling in that monastery over the aforesaid forest, nor should any person dare to construct any instrument to catch fish therein; but (whichever man’s landing places they might be) We concede to the aforesaid monastery the water to be possessed with all fishing rights and all justice in quiet order, under the defence of Our immunity, for eternal repayment, so that it might delight the monks who serve God therein to constantly exhort the Lord’s mercy for Us and Our spouse and offspring and for the stability of Our whole empire conceded to Us by God and conserved for Us by His most clement mercy through immensities.\n\nAnd thus, that this authority might in God’s name obtain firmer vigour and be more diligently conserved by the followers of God’s holy Church and Us, We confirmed it with Our own hand and We commanded it be sealed with the impression of Our signet.\n\nEnacted at the royal palace of Compiègne, in the year of the Incarnation of the Lord nine hundred and seventy four, in the twenty first year of the reign of the most glorious king lord Lothar.\n\nSign of the most glorious king lord Lothar.\n\nI, Adalbero, a royal notary, witnessed on behalf of lord Adalbero, archbishop of Rheims and high chancellor.\n\nSens held a complicated place in Henry’s Burgundy. On one hand, it had been one of the key centres for Richard the Justiciar and his successors. Both Richard and Ralph of Burgundy were buried there, and quite possibly around this time a cleric of the church wrote a poem remembering Richard as a hero of the Burgundian homeland. On the other hand, by the 970s things were rather different. By this point, the archbishops were firm Carolingian allies; and the abbey where the former dukes were buried was held in benefice by the local count, Rainald the Old. However, Rainald was a spanner in the works. Conflict between him and the archbishops was intensifying – Archbishop Anastasius, on Lothar’s orders, had had to be consecrated not at Sens but at Appoigny because Rainald was keeping him out, and Henry’s bastard half-brother Bishop Heribert of Auxerre appears to have fortified his diocese against Rainald (an inference from the Gesta of the bishops of Auxerre that we may well talk about more down the line). This diploma may represent an attempt to confiscate the abbey from him. At minimum, it shows Henry and Lothar collaborating peacefully: Burgundy in the 970s was pretty quiet, and after the death of Alberic of Mâcon power seems to have been divided between Henry and Lothar’s man Lambert of Chalon.\n\nAlso more pointed than it looks is the diploma granted at the same time at the request of Hugh Capet:\n\nD LL5, no. 36 (974, Compiègne)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLothar, by provision of divine clemency king of the Franks.\n\nIf We proffer the assent of Our Benignity to the just and reasonable petitions of servants of God, We repeat works of royal highness and through this We clearly believe We will more easily receive the glory of eternal blessing.\n\nWherefore, let the skill of all the faithful of God’s holy Church and Us, both present and future, know that Duke Hugh [Capet], faithful to Us through everything, along with the monks of the monastery of Centulum, to wit, of the very illustrious confessor of Christ Richer, approaching the serenity of Our Highness, asked that We might fully confirm by an imperial precept certain estates from the same abbey of Saint-Riquier, which Duke Hugh had added to the stipends and uses of the monks for the remedy of his soul, so that they might be taken from them by no diminution of any abbot or any person at any time.\n\nWe clemently heard their prayers, for love of God and His said soldier St Richer, and as well for love of Our most beloved kinsman Duke Hugh, and thus do We wish it to be known that this has been conceded to them in every way. Moreover, We ordered this writing of Our Reverence to be made with this special condition, through which We confirm and confirm the said estates, sited in the district of Ternois, that is, Bourcq in its entirety, also Rollencourt, in the said district, with all its appendages and whatever is seen to be justly and legally beholden to the aforesaid place, as was established by the said duke and by the abbot of the same place, for the uses and stipends of the monks serving Christ in the aforesaid place, that is, that no-one might be permitted to steal anything from the same estates from their dominion, or diminish them, or turn them to other uses; nor should anyone presume to exact provisions or serf-work or army-service or any other renders at all. Rather, as was said, let them securely hold and quietly possess them in Our and future times, in the way and condition that was established by Us and by the aforesaid duke, so that it might delight to incessantly implore the mercy of the most pious Judge for the salvation of Our father and Our happiness and spouse and offspring and for the stability of Our realm.\n\nAnd that this authority might obtain inviolable and undisturbed firmness in future times, We confirmed it with Our own hand below, and We commanded it be signed by the impression of Our signet.\n\nEnacted at the king’s palace of Compiègne, in the year of the Incarnation of the Lord…, in the …th indiction, in the 21st year of the reign of the most glorious king Lothar.\n\nSign of the most glorious king Lothar.\n\nI, Adalbero, a royal notary, witnessed on behalf of lord Adalbero, archbishop of Rheims and high chancellor.\n\n(This act was lightly touched up by the chronicler Hariulf in the eleventh century, but it’s fundamentally kosher.)\n\nI have blogged about the circumstances behind this act before. The short version is that it’s aimed at Arnulf II of Flanders. The return of the Reginarids from exile in 973 had completely changed the political situation in Lower Lotharingia, and cultivating a Flemish connection was no longer immediately useful for Lothar. So, he turned to the Capetians. The region of Ponthieu had been a matter of interest to Hugh the Great back in the mid-century, and overlordship had been disputed for a long time between the Robertians/Capetians and the Flemish. The confirmation of these estates by the king supports Hugh Capet in his de facto overlordship over the south of the region, and threatens Arnulf in the Ternois. In fact, we know from other sources that Hugh Capet’s rule in Ponthieu was very real: it was probably about this time that he appointed a new abbot, Ingelard, for the abbey of Saint-Riquier, with an official brief to improve the standards of religious life and an unofficial one to not be under Flemish influence.\n\nSpeaking of monks, let’s talk about the final diploma:\n\nD LL5, no. 34 (974, Compiègne)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLothar, by propitiation of divine clemency king of the Franks.\n\nSince now at the end of the world the holy Church of God is gravely weighed down by the customs of wicked people, it befits Us, to whom the empire of the realm has been committed by heavenly providence, to more vigilantly stand guard that the betrothed of Our Jesus, that is, the pious Church, exalted by Our fathers, should endure no detriment to its dignity, if We wish the empire of Our Majesty to be defended by the munificence of supernal grace and reach for the dignity of eternity.\n\nWhence, favouring the just petitions of servants of God for love of divine worship, We wish it to be known to all bishops, abbots, dukes, counts, vicars, hundredmen, toll-takers, agents and all administrators of the commonwealth and the other followers of the holy Church of God and Us both present and future, that the venerable man Richard, abbot of the monastery of Fleury, which is built in honour of St Mary and St Peter, prince of the apostles, and of the holy confessor Benedict, where the blessed Benedict rests in body, in the district of Orléanais on the river Loire, brought to Us the precept of authority, that is, of Our forefather the most pious augustus Louis [the Pious], in which was contained that, whether himself or his ancestors, that is, all the kings of the Franks, had held the aforesaid monastery, with the goods and people pertaining and beholden to it, under their protection and defence, and it was always defended and fortified against disturbance by judicial power by the immunities of their authorities. Yet for the confirmation of this matter, the aforesaid abbot asked Us that, in God’s love and reverence of the most blessed virgin Mary, St Peter and St Benedict, following the custom of Our fathers and predecessors, We determined that a precept of Our immunity concerning the same holy place should be made. We proffered assent to his petition, and We decreed a precept of Our authority be made concerning the same holy place, through which We command and order that no public judge nor anyone with judicial power over the aforesaid honours, that is, bishop, abbot, duke, count, viscount, vicar, toll-taker or any agent of the commonwealth, should dare to enter into the churches or fields, estates or other possessions which they justly and legally possess in any districts or territories within the jurisdiction of Our empire, or which hereafter divine piety might wish increase in the right of that holy place, to hear cases or exact peace-money or make a halt or claim hospitality, or take securities or distrain in any way the people, bond or free or in any way dwelling on the land of the power of that monastery, nor require any renders or illicit exactions in Our or future times, or presume to exact anything which was noted above; rather, let the said abbot and his successors be permitted to possess the gods of the aforesaid monastery in quiet order under the defence of Our immunity.\n\nAnd when, by divine summons, the aforesaid abbot or his successors pass from this light, as long as the monks can find amongst themselves such a man as can rule the congregation in accordance with the Rule of St Benedict, let them have through this Our authority and consent licence to elect abbots, so that it might delight the monks (who are seen to serve God therein) to pray for the Lord’s mercy constantly for Us and Our wife and offspring and for the stability of the whole realm committed to and conserved for Us by the Lord.\n\nAnd We concede whatever the fisc can exact from the goods of the aforesaid monastery to the aforesaid monastery and its congregation serving God therein, that it might be an increase and supplement to them in carrying out God’s service.\n\nAnd that this authority might be able to endure undisturbed in Our and future times, with the Lord’s protection, We confirmed it with Our own hand below and We commanded it be sealed below with the impression of Our signet.\n\nEnacted at the king’s palace at Compiègne, in the year of the Lord’s Incarnation 974, in the 21st year of the reign of the most glorious king Lothar.\n\nSign of the most glorious king Lothar.\n\nI, Adalbero, a royal notary, witnessed on behalf of lord Adalbero, archbishop of Rheims and high chancellor.\n\nThis one is a bit more esoteric. Since the early 960s, Fleury had been moving out of the Robertian orbit into which Hugh the Great had tried to push it (never entirely successfully). Abbot Richard had already received a diploma from Lothar in 967, and this act largely repeats that’s content. More important is its unusual and regalian language, which reminds me a lot of Ralph of Burgundy’s Cluny acts. Unlike those, this is not really coherent enough to represent an ideological programme, but it does show the intellectual resources at Lothar’s disposal. However, there was more going on than that. I mentioned last time that William Fierabras of Poitiers was facing trouble in the south. Fleury’s priory at Saint-Benoît-du-Sault was caught up in the fighting, attacked by the forces of La Marche. Richard’s presence at the assembly was also, presumably, to give Lothar the benefit of his local knowledge before the visit to Poitiers which we saw in the last post.\n\nYou know who’s weird? Count Aimo of Auxois. I appreciate that he’s not exactly a household name – in fact, he’s only known at all from a handful of charters – but one of those charters has the merit of having some oddly elaborate diplomatic, so I delved in deeper to what we know. The particular oddness I want to focus on in this post is why he was a count at all. After all, his sphere of activity (insofar as we can see it) was tiny, with a rough radius of a mere twenty kilometres. By contrast, the viscounts of Limoges – who didn’t get to be counts – exercised their power over an area almost three times as large. So why did Aimo get to be so important?\n\nIt was at this point I went back to what by now is an old favourite topic, that of transportation routes and more specifically Roman roads (discussion on Twitter after that post suggested, rightly, that the question be broadened out to routeways more widely, including rivers; but the region we’re looking at is not particularly distinguished by its waterways, despite containing the source of the Seine on its northern fringe). So I went to the good old Regnum Francorum Online, and voila, Auxois and the neighbouring Duesmois have a major route junction at Alise-Sainte-Reine, ancient Alesia! Case closed, I thought; or at least, case closed once I do a little bit of due diligence. One thing I hadn’t considered in the last post is that my boy Maurice Chaume’s enormous early twentieth-century work on basically every aspect of pre-eleventh century Burgundian history might have me covered for Carolingian evidence for routeways, but such proved to be the case.\n\nAnd then my hypothesis ran into trouble. Chaume shows good Carolingian-period evidence for the route from Chalon to Langres and for the old Via Agrippa, from Autun to Auxerre. However, although there is a bit of evidence for trails criss-crossing Auxois, it indicates these were a) largely secondary and b) don’t seem to have followed the old Roman roads. Does this make my theory of a connection between transportation routes and the emergence of small counties in Burgundy unsustainable for the southern part of the region?\n\nIt certainly makes it hard to argue for. Still, if we take a wider look at routeways in the region we can still see a connection between routeways and developing zones of rule in the latter tenth century. To the west, the route which ran Autun –> Saulieu –> Avallon –> Auxerre retained its importance. When Robert the Pious attacked Burgundy in 1005 after the death of his uncle Duke Henry, it was Auxerre then Avallon he captured. There were very good reasons for this. The large Ricardian Burgundy which had emerged during the early tenth century had fallen apart by the third decade of the century. A key date was 955, when Count Gilbert of Burgundy died, leaving his lands to Hugh the Great. Hugh himself died shortly afterwards, leaving the remains of Burgundy to be fought over by various contenders. There were already fault-lines. After 936, Hugh the Great had already had a predominant position in the north-west, in Sens and Auxerre. In the north-east, Robert of Troyes was married to one of Gilbert’s two daughters (the other being married to Hugh the Great’s son Otto) and we can see him in Troyes from the mid-century. The power-base of Hugh the Black, and Gilbert after him, was in the south, in Autun, Mâcon, and Chalon, maybe reaching up towards Dijon on a good day. However, there was also a major royal presence associated with Langres which could not be ignored. After 955, Otto tried to assert himself in Beaune and failed. Robert of Troyes tried to assert himself in Dijon and failed, although that took a lot longer. The big winner was King Lothar, and we’ll go into that in the next paragraph. For now, let’s note that Otto did manage to secure a commanding position in Autun, and when he died in 965 his brother Henry’s duchy was based precisely on this Auxere-Autun axis. Henry of Burgundy’s reign is very much the dark matter of post-Carolingian politics. We can see things go to Hell in a handbasket when he dies, but we have startlingly little idea of what he got up to whilst he lived. Nonetheless, it seems clear that he managed to consolidate what was for all intents and purposes a new regional polity, and that he did so based on a routeway, much as the counts of Brienne and Rosnay did further north, but on a larger scale and with more prestige attached.\n\nThe same happened in the east. Over the 950s and early 960s, Lothar crated a zone of intense royal rule over the route from Langres to Chalon, continuing the close relationship with the bishops of Langres his father Louis IV had enjoyed, winning control of Dijon and turning it into an important royal centre, and patronising the family of the viscounts of Dijon as counts of Chalon (as well as, in my opinion, cats-paws for control of Beaune). Burgundy had always been important to West Frankish kings, but this kind of intensive power over the area between Langres and Chalon was new, and a major reconfiguration of royal geopolitics. As in the case of his non-royal contemporaries, Lothar built a geopolitical zone of rule based on a routeway.\n\nHowever, with Henry controlling the Auxerre –> Autun route and Lothar the Langres –> Chalon route, there was still left a zone in the middle, in Auxois and Duesmois. Controlling this area had not been a negligible priority in the ninth century: during the reign of Boso of Provence, he had delegated one of his leading supporters, Bishop Adalgar of Autun, to guard the area from Semur. After all, even though the evidence amassed by Chaume shows that the routes in the region were secondary, it still shows that they existed, and that they were more than one of them. Moreover, plotting the estates and centres of power of Aimo of Auxois on a map shows that they cluster exactly around Alesia, and thus around the ancient Roman crossroads. Even if these roads couldn’t match the important of the main roads, then, they still possessed some importance, and they represented the only logistical zone in southern Burgundy which was still up for grabs after the third quarter of the tenth century. Auxois first appears consistently as a county rather than a pagus from 977 (there is an outlier in a royal diploma of 927), and Aimo starts appearing in charters as count from 980 in the retinue of Duke Henry. What I think is happening, then, is the cultivation of a new power on the last unclaimed routeway, a position of sufficient importance to claim and/or be given an unusual level of prestige, a level which his Limousin counterparts did not have. From this perspective, Aimo takes him place alongside the other small counts of Burgundy as master of a routeway, and in this case the process was probably controlled and steered as part of the consolidation of Henry’s ducal rule.\n\nRegular readers will often have heard me complain about the source situation for the tenth century. I don’t do it very loudly, not least because the challenges of working in a source-poor period are one of the things I like most about the era, but it can be frustrating. For instance, the virtual silence from the last decades of Louis the Blind has made writing my ongoing article about the end of his regime a struggle for, gosh, five years now. So, with that in mind, I decided to comb later works to see if there were any fragments preserved in later medieval or Early Modern works. The answer was, basically, ‘no’, but I found something else weird.\n\nGodfrey of Viterbo, who was a cleric and official at the courts of Emperors Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa, wrote his Pantheon in 1187. In the narrative portion of his text, he refers to both Louis and to Boso. His section on Boso is just a close paraphrase of Otto of Freising’s Two Cities (right down to the confused Carolingian genealogy), and goes as follows:\n\n[Louis the Stammerer’s] realm of Provence, which his father Charles [of Provence], son of Emperor Lothar [I], had received as his share of the division of the realm was invaded by Boso, to whom the aforesaid Emperor Charles [the Bald] of Gaul had recently given it, and in the first place Boso came to Lyon. There, he was anointed as king of Burgundy and Provence by the Archbishop of Lyon. He was besieged and kicked out by the aforesaid adolescents Louis [III] and Carloman [II].\n\nGodfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, Particula XXII.22\n\nSo far, so normal; but that’s not the only mention of Boso in the Pantheon. Towards the end of the work, Godfrey has a series of poems explaining the meaning of the imperial regalia, and the longest is reserved for the Lance of St Maurice:\n\nWhat does the imperial lance signify, and from where did it come?\n\nMaurice’s lance, the very greatest amidst other signs/ has produced many miracles for worthy cherishers of Christ/, and indeed one of God’s nails is attached to it.\n\nIt subjects to the Empire the powerful waging war/Peoples cannot oppose its movements/Whenever war is fought, it is accustomed to defeat everything.\n\nThe holy lance is accustomed to overcome the quarrels of kings/, it causes Roman nobles to be quirites*/, Caesar has from it that the kingdoms approve of him.\n\nAs long as King Boso of Arles held it/fortune always favoured him in battle,/ bitterness-bearing terror fell upon the natives.\n\nNow, O book, show for what cause, for what reason/the holy lance was given to the empire of Rome after this/ and why our letter speaks of Boso.\n\nHandsome Boso, great king, bold king/, completely unable to sleep whenever he was angry/and when he was put to sleep he bound his sword to his side.\n\nWhoever named him while he rested in sleep/the royal right hand, full of fury, killed the man quickly/ he slept at home alone and without a partner.\n\nThe king was at Arles at Christmas Eve/holy pontiffs arose, prepared for the feast/ devoted to the night office, for praise and song.\n\nAnd when the holy bishop began to carry out the singing of the mass/ the king became angry, because he had not first been summoned/and he struck the mitre on his head with a stick.\n\nA thing full mournful, when the bishop was struck, sanctified/solemn graces were voided./Now you should know what God did next.\n\nThe pontiffs at Arles, who had been dealt with so badly/gathered soldiers and came prepared for war/to undergo the accomplishment of things worthy of a heavenly destiny.\n\nWhence the beleaguered king rose up, summoned to arms/and was vanquished, expelled, and the bishop stood honoured/the king sorrowed, furious, and he was subjected to mockery.\n\nHis defeated mind sorrowed, troubled with great shame/and was unwilling to reign, because he had lost his honour in battle/and he decided that he should become a monk.\n\nWhen Otto the Great held the throne of the empire/and the strengthening fortune fully favoured him/King Boso spoke to him in these words, weeping said:\n\n“I give to you the kingdom, I lay down all honours/hereafter let Our holy lance offer honours to you/ I should cultivate only the life of a monk.\n\nI give to you Viviers; you will sit in the see of Lyon/you will hold these two castles which I have handed over on this side of the Rhône/the king of the Frankish-born seeks no estates there.\n\nMaurice’s lance, which my right hand gives to you/is the head of those which I record as my kingdoms/now the holy lance will give the head of the empire.\n\nWhere the Doubs, Saône and Rhône flow, and where Vienne is/across the Tyrrhenian Sea are the Bosonid kingdoms/the Allobroges and Maurienne look thereto.\n\nGodfrey of Viterbo, Pantheon, Particula XXVI.3\n\n* The word quirites refers to the Roman people at peace, the intended meaning of this line being ‘it renders the Roman aristocracy peaceful’.\n\nSo this is odder.\n\nHistorically, the Holy Lance (which Godfrey characterises as the Lance of St Maurice) had been part of the treasure of the abbey of Agaune. Liutprand of Cremona says that King Rudolf II of Transjurane Burgundy gave it to Henry the Fowler, probably in 926. Godfrey clearly knows this story, because he mentions it in a different bit of the Pantheon; but he says that other people give the Boso story as he repeats it here. It has to be said that we don’t know who these ‘other people’ were, because Godfrey is the first person to record this. To my knowledge, the only person to discuss the Bosonid aspects of this story is Edina Bozóky and she’s largely baffled by the sources as well.\n\nThe incident is definitely not historical. Boso and Otto were not contemporaries, and, from Otto of Freising, Godfrey knows it. So we are left looking for literary antecedents. Some of this is completely opaque – the bit about Boso killing a man whilst he’s asleep I can’t find any precedent for, although maybe there’s something in a chanson de geste or other epic I don’t know. (Leave suggestions in the comments!) Other parts are straightforward. Godfrey’s description of the power of the lance is based on ideas going back to the tenth century, although Godfrey was apparently the only person in the late twelfth who was this interested. Similarly, the setting of the location in Arles, rather than Vienne (a place strongly associated with both St Maurice and Boso), is presumably because of the coronation of Frederick Barbarossa as king of Burgundy there in 1178. Most interesting for me is the crux of the story being Boso’s hitting the Archbishop of Arles over the head with a stick. This ultimately derives from something reported of King Zwentibald and Ratbod of Trier in the Annals of Fulda, and originally had nothing to do with Boso at all.\n\nWhat then is the purpose of the story? The goal is fairly clear from the final section: Boso’s grant of Provence to Otto the Great justifies Frederick Barbarossa’s holding of the Burgundian kingdom now, something sealed with the divine favour conveyed by the lance. What’s baffling is why Godfrey has associated this with Boso. From elsewhere in the Pantheon, Godfrey apparently knows that the lance was handed over by Rudolf III, that the archbishop was hit over the head by Zwentibald, and that the Burgundian kingdom came to the Empire in the reign of Conrad II. Yet he combines these elements and more into a thoroughly ahistorical story about a king who was largely forgotten and whose dynasty had died out a quarter of a millennium earlier. It’s interesting that he was inspired to create this Late/Post-Carolingian melange, but his motivations for doing so are a mystery to me. Maybe you have an answer?\n\nBy the early 960s, an era was drawing to a close. King Lothar was now in his twenties, and the great dramas of the first ten years of his reign were starting to die down. The succession to Hugh the Great in the Neustrian March was settling, not least in the face of Count Robert of Troyes’ continued occupation of the citadel of Dijon in the teeth of Lothar’s opposition. Here too, though, the years around 960 saw a settlement being reached. Lothar’s family was also changing shape. In 965, his uncle Archbishop Bruno of Cologne died. His mother, Queen Gerberga, lived for several more years but retreated into the background at roughly the same time. In the same year as Bruno’s death, moreover, Lothar married Otto the Great’s step-daughter Emma of Italy.\n\nStill, in 961 all that is yet to come, and we have this week a diploma giving us a snapshot of Lothar’s early regime before the end:\n\nD Lo no. 14 (5th October 961) = ARTEM no. 160\n\nIn the name of the holy and individual Trinity.\n\nLothar, by God’s grace king.\n\nLet it be known to all Our followers both present and future that Hugh, a count and Our kinsman, struck by the infirmity which caused him to leave this mortal coil, assigned to Our jurisdiction and granted to Our power the properties which either he possessed or which were unjustly stolen from him and he had legally and justly endeavoured to acquire, making the saints heirs thereto, provided that, by Our royal authority and guarantee, they be described to the churches to which he had designated they be given whilst he was still healthy; that is, so that what he had conferred upon the saints for the remedy of his soul not be taken by the frauds of bad people, who show themselves in acts of perverse habit to be completely unaware of God, and who decided by some vile means to possess the inheritance of sanctuaries of the Lord, not knowing the king and prophet David, who called down such curses as to send such people into the eternal storm, into disturbance, into ignominy and into eternal perdition, which curses the Universal Church thunders.\n\nWherefore through the consent of both Our bishops and Our counts and the others dwelling in Our palace, it pleased Us to give goods from the aforesaid goods of the said Count Hugh to each church as he had disposed, through Our precept. Whence Our most glorious mother Queen Gerberga, a lover of churches, approaching Our presence along with the venerable bishops Roric [of Laon] and Gibuin [of Châlons] and Count Ragenold [of Roucy], in order that We might give a certain curtilage from the aforesaid goods to Saint-Remi as the aforesaid Hugh had designated, that is, where that man of good memory had disposed to be buried both for the help of St Remigius and also for love of his lord the most glorious King Louis [IV], to wit, Our father.\n\nAssenting to their petitions, as was worthy, We give to Saint-Remi, as Hugh had designated, the curtilage which is called Condes, to wit, sited in the county of Bologne-sur-Marne, with all its appendages, meadows, woods, lands cultivated and uncultivated, pastures, waters and watercourses, incomes and renders; with bondsmen of both sexes, churches and mills, and with – as We said – all the goods pertaining to it, for the victuals of the monks.\n\nWhence We commanded this precept be mad, so that no person might come along and inflict any harassment on them. If they try this, let them know that they have acted against Our decree, for which reason let them incur the wrath of God and of all the saints and Us, and be unable to vindicate their claim, and thus led them come to justice and bestow a hundred pounds of gold for the service of Saint-Remi and the brothers, and leave denied.\n\nAnd that this might endure more firmly, confirming it with Our own hand We commanded it be signed with the impression of Our signet.\n\nSign of the most glorious king lord Lothar.\n\nChancellor Gezo witnessed and subscribed.\n\nEnacted on the 3rd nones of October, in the 4th indiction, in the 7th year of the reign of the lord king Lothar.\n\nEnacted in the estate of Condes.\n\nLet’s start with Count Hugh. When Lothar says that Hugh was his ‘kinsman’, he’s being a little expansive with the term. Count Hugh seems to be the son of Count Roger II of Laon who himself was – probably but not certainly – the great-grandson of Louis the Pious via his daughter Gisla, wife of Eberhard of Friuli. This made him Lothar’s third cousin once removed. At that distance, being called a royal kinsman is as much a statement of alliance as anything else. It happens that (there being very little charter evidence from north-eastern France for much of the tenth century) we haven’t really encountered this family before, although from Flodoard’s Annals it’s clear they were significant regional players. In the early years of Louis IV’s reign, Roger II was not always a reliable ally. Eventually, though, he was brought on side, and the one time we’ve encountered him he was accompanying Louis to Aquitaine before dying soon afterwards. Hugh is a yet more exiguous figure, but from this diploma it’s clear he was quite important in Lothar’s following. Having now done a whole lot more reading around the subject than I had when I started this paragraph, largely in the vain hope of finding someone who would cite an actual source, I can say that he is often called count of Bolenois and/or Bassigny and given a lot of basically unsupportable genealogical connections. In actually, all we can say is that he was a major landowner in the area around Chaumont. That’s not nothing, though! This property here, at Condes, was one of two major tranches of land Hugh gave to Saint-Remi, alongside the Val-de-Rognon, south of Chaumont. These lands put Hugh right next to Lothar’s ally Abbot Odalric, who would be elected as archbishop of Rheims the following year; and also no more than about ten miles from the Roman road from Châlons to Langres which was an important transport corridor for Louis IV and Lothar and which we have discussed before. This route would have had particular salience in 961, with Lothar’s control over Dijon somewhat shaky. The disposition of Hugh’s estates, therefore, had real contemporary significance.\n\nThis diploma, though, gives us a sense of who is around Lothar at this time, his chief courtiers. The influence of Queen Gerberga here is noticeable: if you remember her charter for Homblières, you’ll remember Roric of Laon was there too, and I’ve written before about the role of Ragenold of Roucy (Gerberga’s son-in-law, and a prominent figure in Burgundian affairs) played in the 940s and 950s. Moreover, we can’t forget the significance of Saint-Remi either. Gerberga had an especial devotion to St Remigius, and as long as she was alive Rheims and its main abbey remained key elements in West Frankish royal power.\n\nThis would change by the 970s, as would almost everything else this charter shows about Lothar’s network of power. Nonetheless, the regime we see here stayed more-or-less stable for about a decade, maybe a decade and a half, and this charter is a key source for reconstructing it.\n\nThe idea of a ‘charter’ is a flexible one. My favourite example of this is a document from the church of Saint-Maturin de Larchant, which is half saint’s life and half property register and probably wouldn’t be counted as a ‘charter’ except for the fact that it’s a parchment single-sheet. Another case in point is this week’s document, from the archives of Fleury’s priory Perrecy, located about half-way between Autun and Mâcon. Perrecy has had a lot of interest from historians because it preserves some really interesting ninth-century documents, including what seem to be the traces of a lay archive; but it also has the following oddity, which has the remnants of a charter in it at one point, but is really more of a short sacred history:\n\nFleury no. 51 (late 950s)\n\nIn the time of Hugh the Great, and Lambert [of Chalon], count of the Allobroges, Letald the knight, uncle of Teduin of Sancerre, seeking Burgundy, committed himself to the aforesaid Lambert and to Bernard, that is, his relative. Having received their grace, they bestowed many goods upon him, from which he acquired certain others by his labour. Therefore, in their times, the men of Auvergne left their borders and entered Burgundy, and plundered the fields, and took everything, and thus went home. When they had already completed three return journeys, the report reached the Allobroges and disturbed some of the powerful among them, and incited Lambert and Bernard (by God’s gift always victor in battle), to battle.\n\nThey came together, and took counsel with their gathered potentates as to what should be done in circumstances of such peril, and whom they should send to oppose such evil. Their unanimous opinion settled on Bernard and entreated he be made their leader. Lambert, joyfully assenting to their petitions, exhorted Bernard in these words: ‘As you see, most faithful follower of mine, great necessity urges us to stand against our enemies; but it befits us to first establish someone experienced who can lead our forces with distinction. For this reason, because your nobility in such matters has, by God’s gift, been often proven, we ask you to be the general of our forces and to help out with such a necessity’. Bernard said, ‘I give thanks to God, Who has led me back safe from such perils as often as has pleased Him; but up until now I have been greatly worn down by this, and my inner voice is currently not telling me to seek them out, having not been enriched by such labours.’ Lambert responded to this: ‘I know for sure that you have deserved much more than your nobility possesses, and for this reason you will not feel sorry for having worked in vain if you do not put off coming to help with such a necessity.’ Bernard spoke and responded: ‘I am not conniving to seek any advantage for what Your Highness asks – particularly since I know not what the Highest Majesty has decreed in this conflict – but if God’s usual clemency should make me victorious and unharmed, let your soul deliberate what it might worthily and in the very best way bestow’. Lambert promised this quite happily. Together they sought Perrecy, and approached Richard (who presided over the same place at that time), to defend themselves by grace of prayer. Having offered from his estates one manse in Curdin with a serf and meadows, vineyards, lands cultivated and uncultivated; and another with another serf in Gentiliaca Villa, in the place called Renosus, with meadows, vineyards, lands cultivated and uncultivated, and enjoyment of the wood, Bernard brought with him relics of the saints he had already used in some battles.\n\nFortified (under God’s clemency) by such a defence, therefore, he met the enemies in the district of the Bourbonnais, and battle was joined over the estate of Chalmoux, and he slew them with such slaughter that the rivers were blocked up, losing no more than 15 of his own men, including the aforesaid Letald, Guy, and Arnald. Therefore, to fulfil his vow, having gained the victory, he returned home rejoicing with the aforesaid, bringing Letald to Perrecy. For the remedy of their souls, the aforesaid Lambert and Bernard both bestowed on the same place in perpetuity as a gift whatever they possessed from them or had bought from others from their estates: that is, one manse with an enclosure in the estate which is called Vicille Vigne, another in the place which is called Montceau (which the aforesaid Letald bought from Constable and from his heirs), with one field between La Creuse and La Goutte, which descends from Hill Bridge; another manse in the place called La Vaux, and half of Hill Bridge, and half of Taxeneriarus; and whatever Guy and Arnald acquired in L’Hessard, that is, one curtilage at Dear Place, one field with vineyards, lands cultivated and uncultivated, and woods, and whatever is there with renders and customs from everything, under such an injunction that whosoever might try to infringe or reclaim any of these which have been named should receive damnation with Judas the Betrayer, Annais and Caiphas, with the Devil and his angels in the eternal fire; and should pay 10 pounds of gold to them on whom he inflicted the quarrel, with the fisc confiscating, and his claim should be entirely frustrated.\n\nThat this donation might endure firm and stable, relying on this guarantee, after witnesses have subscribed, we undersigned it.\n\nLambert (☧), Bernard, Leotald (☧), Giso, David, Hilderic, Antus, Rainer, Deodatus, Budo.\n\nThis is another document where the date it all happens is unclear, not least because it evidently takes place over the course of several years. The reference to Hugh the Great, who died in 956, puts our terminus ante quem in the mid-950s; but Lambert of Chalon (for it is he) only became count in around 959. With that said, Lambert, the son of Viscount Robert of Dijon, was still a prominent figure in southern Burgundian politics before Lothar handed Chalon over to him, and so c. 955-960 is a good time-frame for these events.\n\nAnd these are pretty interesting events: fighting between royal allies (Lambert and co.) and Auvergnat raiders in the marches of the Auvergne and Mâconnais. This all fits into what we were discussing last time: the attempts by William Towhead of Poitiers to assert himself in eastern Aquitaine. The year 955 had largely frustrated him: he had been defeated outside Poitiers (although an attack on the city itself had been thwarted) and the archbishopric of Bourges had gone to Richard I, brother of Hugh the Great’s key ally Theobald the Trickster. By the years around 958, though, he was doing better, probably capturing Nevers. It is in this context that we can probably see the Auvergnat raids this charter refers to.\n\nWe have noted in prior posts that the Auvergnat elite in the latter 950s was divided, with one portion favouring William Towhead and one portion favouring Stephen of Clermont. In 956/957, Stephen had the upper hand (as we have seen in other charters on this blog) but William remained a contender and the raids of 958 and earlier years into Burgundy may have a surprising amount in common with viking raids. One of the standard explanations for viking raids is that they were expeditions to gain booty and political capital in order to pursue political objectives at home; and this may well be what’s happening here. (Not for nothing did Timothy Reuter say that ‘for most of Europe the Franks were the vikings’.)\n\nHowever, raids into this area would have been particularly problematic for Lambert, whose powerbase seems to have been in precisely this border region, around the Charolais and Paray-le-Monial. I don’t think we have to see an actual civil war here. Lambert of Chalon and Abbot Richard of Fleury between them are a constellation of royal allies. But although (as we’ll cover later) Lothar certainly had a vested interest in keeping William down, this reads more like a primarily local affair, dictated by local interests and at best secondarily reaching towards a wider frame.\n\nAs such, the shafts of light this act shines on relations within an aristocratic entourage are quite interesting. Letald appears as a roving warrior, seeking employment based on family ties with an up-and-coming pair of leaders. (I have to confess I have no idea who Bernard is outside of this charter; he’s clearly important, but also subordinate to Lambert.) Lambert and Bernard evidently have a duty of care towards him even after his death. Lambert also apparently has a duty towards Bernard, but although Bernard acknowledges Lambert as his boss, he’s also apparently in a position to basically blackmail him for more stuff in situations of urgency. In fact, the transactional nature of the relationship reminds me of nothing so much as the Conventum of Hugh the Chiliarch; and like that text makes me wonder whether the relationship in question is purely transactional. Ultimately, I think not: the negotiations around Bernard’s appointment come in the context of an assembly of whoever the scribe is subsuming under the Classicising term ‘Allobroges’ (for my money, it probably would be something like ‘Southern Burgundians’), under Lambert’s leadership. What I think is happening is that this kind of (leader-based?) group membership is the stage setting in which this kind of negotiation can take place, and that the combination of intercutting regional and sub-regional groups and negotiable relations of fidelity within them are pretty basic for noble power at this time. (I also think this represents a bit of a change from the late ninth century, but that’s a story for another moment!)\n\nMore on Burgundy! We did some of this last week, I know. However, the Cluniac archives are such a rich source that it’s hard not to succumb to the temptation to highlight some of the gems they contain. Moreover, the historiographical emphasis on the north-east as both a hub for royal power and, more generally, the cockpit of the West Frankish kingdom is so prevailing; and the historical importance of Burgundy so significant, that it’s really important to emphasise and re-emphasise the point. Burgundian support was key to West Frankish rulers from Charles the Bald onwards, and despite how fragmentary our evidence is, it’s clear that it remained so into the tenth century. As a case in point, this charter:\n\nCC no. 1.730 (c. 950)\n\nUnless it is defeated either by love of an eternal homeland or frightened off by the terror of future judgement, the insatiable greed of this world is – far from doubt – in no way able to extinguish misery; it happens for this reason that people do not fear to transfer not only the goods of the poor, but also churchly goods, into their own uses. I, Sobbo the sinner, confess myself to have done this. But returning now to my right mind, and considering the most exacting judgment of divine reproach, I wish and desire that both the sublimity of princes and the priestly dignity and also the generality of everyone should know that until now I unjustly kept hold of the abbey of Charlieu, and I render myself culpable thereby. The same place was the inheritance of the late Robert, bishop of Valence, who build a monastery there, and took care to solemnly dedicate it in honour of the blessed martyrs Stephen, Felix, Fortunatus and Achilles, and delegated brothers to live there in accordance with the Rule. Once his praiseworthy vow had been put into effect, he did not neglect to give it over to the holy Roman church, to that it might endure under the perpetual tutelage of the same.\n\nLater, lord Odo [of Cluny], whose memory is fittingly celebrated with praise, through King Hugh [of Arles], by the ordination of apostolic authority, obtained through a privilege that the aforesaid place be bestowed on the monastery of Cluny; the most glorious King Louis [IV] as well deigned to confirm it by a precept of his regality.\n\nTherefore, overcome by such authorities, breaking asunder the bridle of greed, I restored and surrendered the aforesaid abbey in its entirety to lord Aimard, venerable abbot of the abbey of Cluny, for the remedy of my soul, and cast myself out from there forever. To destroy all calumnies, I prayed the testament of this notice of restoration be made, through which let the said abbot and his successors perpetually possess the aforesaid place, hold it as their own, and ordain it legally and in accordance with the Rule.\n\nIf any of my heirs, or anyone else, might presume to calumniate this testament, let them be subject to every curse unless they quickly come to their senses.\n\nSobbo. Maimbod, bishop of the holy church of Mâcon. Guy, bishop of Soissons. Gibuin, bishop of Autun [recte Châlons]. Anskeric, son of Sobbo. Roland. Bernard. Guy. Walo. Prior Humbert. Aimoin. Abbot Robert. Ragenold [of Roucy], count of Rheims. Hugh. Odalric. Theodoric. Ingobrand. Richer. Aimo. Stephen. Aldin. Bernard. Otard.\n\nIn the reign of King Louis.\n\nA small thing to start with: there was a protracted (and frankly interminable) debate amongst older scholarship as to whether Ragenold of Roucy was count of Roucy or count of Rheims. Personally, I don’t think his comital status derived from specific comital office at all – Flodoard says pretty explicitly that it derived from his Königsnahe and whatever administrative jurisdiction he possessed was probably irrelevant to it – but this charter is decent evidence that he did have lay jurisdiction at Rheims. It’s not perfect evidence, though – this is an eleventh-century copy that gets other things wrong (Bishop Gibuin’s see, for example), and we’ve seen in the pastthat later scribes were not averse to giving people erroneous titles based on what held true in their own day.\n\nRegardless of that, if last time we saw Burgundians communicating with the royal court, here we can see a fairly hefty delegation of northerners going south. We don’t know exactly when this happened (beyond ‘around 950’), but it’s evidence of continuing and ongoing ties between Burgundy and West Frankish kingship. Particularly interesting is the reference to a royal precept referring to Charlieu. This is one of the Chevrigny diplomas we saw a few weeks ago, and it’s therefore intriguing that we have this private charter later and separately. I think what’s happening here is that, both practically and symbolically, Louis’ delegation is confirming this transaction now that the king is out of Hugh the Great’s thumb. As that specific diploma was also the one granting to Cluny property pertaining to Saint-Martin of Tours, I wonder if we might not also be seeing a kind of show of force in front of Sobbo, reminding him who’s boss?\n\nOn a bigger picture, despite the fact that by now Conrad the Pacific was fully set up in Provence, this is yet another occasion where the Trans-Ararian Fluidity Zone is in effect! Sobbo refers to precepts from both Louis and Hugh of Arles, and although the abbey is in the Mâconnais it was founded by the bishop of Valence; and Sobbo himself probably has kinship ties to several archbishops of Lyon and Vienne. There’s a bit of a parallel between this and the Lotharingian networks we were looking at last week: whatever the nominal borders were, cross-border networks were really important for actual on-the-ground politics.\n\nAs this year drags itself towards its close, and we’re left pondering that, like Conservative prime ministers of the UK, ‘worst years ever’ are coming thicker and faster these days*, something small has popped through my letterbox to try and alleviate the winter gloom. That’s right, my latest article is in print!\n\nSome of you may remember from years ago that I was, on the side, doing a bit of looking at the re-use of charter preambles, known as arengae, in royal diplomas. Well, at one point in lockdown I went into this hard, and I now have a Word document with basically every royal arenga on it to do compare-and-contrast with. After having done this, I noticed one strange thing: a diploma of Robert the Pious and his son Hugh for the cathedral church of Chalon had an arenga that was only ever otherwise used for a short period by Louis IV. So I made further textual comparison, and it turns out that Robert’s act is close to the style of a certain kind of acts of Louis, and these acts of Louis are so distinctive that only a missing example could have provided the model.\n\nThat’s obviously a very bald statement, and for the full case you’ll need to consult this, in the latest edition of Francia. As usual with Continental European journals, it’s not open access yet, but it will be after a couple of years and when it is you’ll be able to get the link from the blog. In the meantime, as ever, I have PDF offprints I’d be glad to sent to you if you contact me on the blog, on twitter, or by email at ralph [dot] torta [at] gmail [dot] com. The full citation is:\n\nFraser McNair, ‘A lost diploma of Louis IV for the church of Chalon-sur-Saône?’, Francia 49 (2022), pp. 479-490.\n\nI’m pleased with the reasoning here. I’ve always argued that Burgundy is a lot more important to the West Frankish kings than is usually appreciated, but one problem in showing that is source preservation. Here, though, we have a diploma not hinted at in any of our sources whose existence is only deducible through textual comparison. This method might have further applications, but you do need quite specific comparanda – arengae which are unusually distinctive but not actually unique – of which there aren’t many out there.\n\nThe gritty details: Another straightforward case. I did the research for this in lockdown, summer 2020, wrote it up at the very very start of 2021 and submitted it. One round of peer review later, re-submitted about three-quarters of the way through 2021 and has come out now, autumn 2022.\n\n*Still 2016, for my money; by 2020 the bar had been set so low that ‘global plague’ felt par for the course and 2022 is clearly, erm, ‘benefitting’ from the same effect.\n\nNot one but two charters for you today! As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, after Louis IV’s imprisonment in 946, Otto the Great came to help his brother-in-law, and the tide turned in Louis’ favour. By 949, it was clear that Louis was going to win the war – or, rather, that Otto was, as the East Frankish king’s interests weighed heavily in the balance. However, Louis’ own authority was substantially repaired, and we can see that in our documentary evidence, including both of today’s documents. Our first comes from the north-east, from a very small abbey called Homblières that I wrote about in one of my very first articles. The backstory here is that the materially poor community also had a holiness problem. Most of the time monks replace nuns, the nuns’ character is slandered by the community which replaced them to justify the replacement. At Homblières, the opposite is true: the new abbot, Berner, wrote hagiographical works lauding his predecessor Abbess Bertha, trying to establish that Homblières always had been a holy centre of true religion – which strongly suggests that, in this case, it was perceived as genuinely problematic by some of its neighbours. Anyway, we have a community of badly behaving nuns – what now?\n\nD L4, no. 32 (1st October 949, Rheims)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLouis, by God’s grace king of the Franks.\n\nIf, by paying attention to divine worship, We endeavour to raise the Church of God to the highest state of holy religion, We use royal right and the privileges of Our progenitors.\n\nWherefore, let the skill of all the followers of the holy Church of God both present and future know that, approaching the presence, Count Albert [the Pious of Vermandois] of famous character, along with the noble man Eilbert [of Florennes] and his wife Hersind, suppliantly entreating Our Munificence that Our Clemency might deign to hep a certain little place sited in the district of Vermandois, which is vulgarly called Homblières, where the most sacred bride of Christ Hunegund awaits the day of blessed remuneration, because certain nuns were not living entirely honourable therein and, being unwilling to be subject to the governance of the Rule, were removed therefrom, and monks were put in their place who would obey the Rule and an abbot, because, with the assent of Our authority, the aforesaid Elibert restored the aforesaid abbey to his lord the count, that is, Albert, and the same count bestowed the same on Our rule, to wit, on the condition that We might command it be defended by a precept of Our authority in such a way that, without any diminution at all, and without any subjection to anywhere else, it might remain conceded to a regular abbot inviolably and in perpetuity.\n\nTherefore, by the favour of Our wife [Queen Gerberga] and the venerable Archbishop Artald [of Rheims], with Bishops Guy [of Soissons] and Gibuin [of Châlons] and the most splendid Abbot Hincmar [of Saint-Remi de Rheims] and the monks of the same congregation, and Counts Albert (the aforesaid) and Ragenold [of Roucy], and by the prayers and praises of all Our followers who were present, We decreed it be so done. With the counsel of all of them, We established that the said abbey in its entirety should be held in perpetuity by a regular abbot for the observation of the Rule in the same place.\n\nAnd that this emolument of Our authority might be conserved inviolably through the course of times to come, confirming it below with Our hand We commanded it be corroborated by Our seal.\n\nSeal of lord Louis, most glorious king of the Franks.\n\nOdilo the notary witnessed on behalf of Artald, archbishop and high chancellor.\n\nEnacted at the city of Rheims in the monastery of Saint-Remi, on the kalends of October, in the 6th indiction, in the 14th year of the reign of the glorious King Louis, in the year of the Lord’s Incarnation 948 [sic].\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Albert the Pious is a significant figure to show up at this time. He was a son of Heribert II of Vermandois, one of Hugh the Great’s nephews, and in 949 he had jumped ship to Louis’ side. As we saw back in 946, the Heribertians were key allies of Hugh the Great, so Albert’s loss was emblematic of the significant blows his cause was suffering. Albert’s place amongst Louis’ supporters is validated here by the presence of a coterie of people who were now Louis’ main supporters in the north-east: Artald of Rheims (on whom more in a couple of months), Guy of Soissons, and the young Gibuin of Châlons, probably not older than his early twenties and at the start of fifty years of being a major prop of the Carolingian regime. (The main missing figure here is Louis’ half-brother Roric, formerly a royal notary but recently installed as bishop of Laon.) We also have Ragenold of Roucy, now one of Louis’ key lay followers, who at this time also probably became Albert’s brother-in-law: Ragenold was married to one of Gerberga’s daughters and likely at this time Albert married another.\n\nYet purely material concerns aren’t the only thing happening in this document. The arenga there, which I think of as following the operam dantes formula after the opening words, is a new development which is significant. This arenga would be used in almost all Louis’ acts until the end of his reign. It coincides with the emergence of this new court circle and the renewed importance of Queen Gerberga and her Lotharingian and Lotharingian-facing allies. The sentiment of the arenga, emphasising the need for Church reform and the specifically royal privilege and duty to carry it out, spoke to this new circle and suggested a new, or at least newly emphasised, basis for royal authority (again, we’ll come back to this when we talk about Rheims in 953).\n\nThe north-east wasn’t the only important place, though. Our second diploma comes from Burgundy:\n\nD L4 no. 33 (10th November 949, Autun)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLouis, by propitiation of divine clemency king of the Franks.\n\nWe wish it to be known to all of the faithful of the holy Church of God that, in the year of the Lord’s Incarnation 949, when the lofty margrave Hugh [the Black], son of Richard [the Justiciar], Our follower, and Count Gilbert [of Burgundy], and the magnates of the realm of Burgundy had convened in the city of Autun to deliberate over the holy Church of God and to deal with the utility of the realm, amongst other things, Hildebod, bishop of Chalon, and the monks of Cluny, made a complaint concerning the failure of religion at the monastery of Saint-Martin [d’Autun], sited in the suburbs of the same city, which was once special with all religion and honour, but is now completely deprived of the status of its dignity and the patronage of an abbot. Therefore, whilst they were seeking in turn a person on whom this salubrious burden could be imposed, the monks of the same place stood by with a privilege of Pope Gregory, asking that, as is contained in the same document, the election might be conceded to them. This was conceded, and they unanimously elected one of their own, named Humbert, whom they brought with them not many days later, that is, on the feast of St Philibert, and presented to the same princes. Rejoicing in their choice, and proffering assent to their petitions, they committed the aforesaid abbey in its entirety on Our behalf to the same Humbert.\n\nBut because the same place should be given by the king’s hand, the aforesaid man approached the presence of Our Highness as quickly as he could. Whence, on account of the intervention of Our wife, and with the leading men of Our realm, to wit, Archbishop Artald [of Rheims], Bishops Gozlin [of Toul] and Achard [of Langres], and the venerable Abbot Hincmar [of Saint-Remi] and Counts Ragenold [of Roucy], Bernard and Theodoric standing by and approving with Our other followers, for the remedy of Our soul and Our progenitors, We conceded the same place to him for the repair of religion.\n\nWherefore, We ordered a precept of Our Highness to be made and given to the aforesaid Abbot Humbert, through which he might hold the aforesaid abbey with the cell which is called Anzy-le-Duc and all its appendages in accordance with the Rule.\n\nAnd that this concession of Our authority might be conserved inviolably, confirming it below with Our own hand, We commanded it be corroborated by the image of Our signet.\n\nSign of lord Louis, the most glorious king.\n\nOdilo the notary witnessed and subscribed on behalf of Bishop and High Chancellor Artald.\n\nGiven in the city of Autun, on the 4th ides of November, in the 7th indiction, in the 14th year of the reign of the glorious King Louis.\n\nThe diplomatic of this document is peculiar, and appears to have been formed out of a mash-up of a synodal document and a royal diploma per se. There’s no reason to doubt its authenticity, despite how weird it is: what I suspect happened is that Abbot Humbert bought the synodal document and it was just copied wholesale by the royal scribe (although it’s quite possible that this is a later mash-up of two separate but still genuine documents).\n\nAnyway, second verse same as the first: we see here once again the importance of sponsoring monastic reform to Louis’ re-established authority; and we also get another sense of that new court circle. Counts Bernard and Theodoric’s spheres of influence are unknown, but were probably in the forested regions to the east of Rheims, on the West Frankish-Lotharingian border. Ragenold of Roucy we’ve already met. Gozlin of Toul – Charles the Simple’s old notary – is a particularly interesting case, and his presence illustrates the importance of Lotharingians to Louis’ new regime. With Louis now acting as (in essence) Otto’s underking, there was a kind of merging of the West Frankish and Lotharingian kingdoms at the highest level after a 940s where the two realms looked in different directions. Finally, as always, we have the Burgundians. Achard of Langres’ presence is a major indicator of how important this see was – in fact, Achard’s predecessor Heiric had acted as Louis’ archchancellor in the past. Overall, though, the importance of Burgundy to West Frankish royal power at this time can’t be understated, and definitely shouldn’t be minimised – and we’ll see more of this next week."
