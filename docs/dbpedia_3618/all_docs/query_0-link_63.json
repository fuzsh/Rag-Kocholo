        "text": "Francia Media, Lorraine\n\nWhen the Emperor Lothar I died in 855, his \"middle kingdom\" (Francia Media) was divided, in the Treaty of Prüm, between his three sons: (1) Louis II received Italy and the Imperial crown, (2) Charles, Burgundy, and (3) Lothar II what was left, the area from Burgundy down to the North Sea. There was no traditional name for such an area, so it came to be called after Lothar II himself: Lotharingia.\n\nThis has become Lothringen in German and Lorraine in French and English. The lack of male heirs for all these meant that Italy, Burgundy, and Lorraine all were subsequently divided and passed around among the Carolingian heirs of East and West. Lorraine soon lost independent status and became a dependency, a Stem Duchy, of the East Frankish Kingdom, except briefly when it adhered to the West (911-925). The Duchy itself then became divided between the south, or Upper Lorraine, and the north, or Lower Lorraine (959). \"Upper\" and \"Lower\" were in the relation to the river systems in the area, especially the Rhine and its tributaries, which flow north.\n\nThe heart of Upper Lorraine was Nancy (Nanzig in German, Nanciacum in Latin, although this was not a Roman city; it dates from 1050, founded by the Duke Gerard), in a bend of the Moselle (Mosel in German, Mosella in Latin) River. Upper Lorraine originally extended all the way down to the Rhine on the Moselle and included Trier,\n\nFiefs of Lorraine Duchy of Lorraine\n\nDuchy of Upper Lorraine\n\nDuchy of Lower Lorraine\n\nCounty & Duchy of Brabant\n\nCounty & Duchy of Bar\n\nPrince-Bishops of Liège\n\nPrince-Bishops of Cologne & Trier\n\nCounty of Hainault\n\nCounts & Dukes of Berg, Jülich, Mark, & Cleves\n\nCounty & Duchy of Luxemburg\n\nCounty of Holland\n\nRepublic & Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nKingdom of Belgium\n\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg\n\nbut the border gradually retreated up river, and Trier itself became an independent Ecclesiastical Electorate of the Empire. Also on the Moselle are Épinal, Toul (Tullum Leucorum in Latin), and Metz (Divodurum in Latin).\n\nUpper Lorraine bordered, to the east, on Alsace, part of the Duchy of Swabia, to the south, on the Free County of Burgundy, and to the west, on Champagne. The western border was originally between the Marne and the Meuse (Maas in Dutch and German, Mosa in Latin). Significant cities on the Meuse are Verdun (Wirten in German, Verodunum in Latin), Sedan (where the Germans defeated France in 1870 and crossed the Meuse with Panzers in 1940), Namur, Liège (Luik in Dutch or Flemish, Lüttich in German, & Leodium in Latin), and Maastricht (Mosae Trajectum in Latin, i.e. \"crossing of the Meuse\"). Near Sedan is Rocroi, where the Spanish Army was destroyed (or at least heavily defeated) by France in 1643. Near Liège and Maastricht is Aachen, Aix-la-Chappelle in French (either Aquis Granum or Aquis Villa in Latin, Aken in Dutch, Oche in the local Rhenish Franconian dialect of German), which was the capital of Charlemangne. From there the river continues down through the Netherlands into the North Sea.\n\nLotharingia, A Personal History\n\nWe now have a new book all about the history of Lorraine -- Lotharingia, A Personal History of Europe's Lost Country, by Simon Winder [Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2019]. However, Winder gets off to a start with something I found confusing. He says that \"Lothar II received everything north of Provence,\" which includes \"the northern part of the Swiss Confederation,\" where \"The arc of Lake Geneva is the clear southern point...\" [pp.4-5]. But this description includes most of what would be the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy, including the Free County of Burgundy, which Winder does not identify as such. Also what remains of Burgundy, which went to Charles, was not just what would become Provence, but also the historic domains of the Dauphiné and Savoy. Either way, Charles seems a bit shortchanged.\n\nI find at Wikipedia a map that shows Upper Burgundy as part of Lothar's domain [whose author should be acknowledged, except that I cannot figure out who the author is]; but it includes a boundary that separates Burgundy from what would become the realm of Lotharingia. There are statements in the article on Upper Burgundy that acknowledge Lothar's possession, but nothing that this part of historic Burgundy had ever been called \"Lotharingia.\" Winder leaves this unclarified, and Burgundy unnamed. On my schematic map at right I have drawn a line in blue to show the apparent divison of Burgundy between Lothar and Charles.\n\nWinder's statement that everything north of \"Provence\" was \"a region which was called after him [i.e. Lothar] Lotharingia, 'the lands of Lothar',\" seems to be false. \"Lotharingia\" would be applied to lands with no previous collective identity, which did not include any part of Burgundy -- hence the boundary on the map at left. Winder does acknowledge that his treatment of Lotharingia does not include \"Geneva,\" but there was a lot more to Burgundy than that, and Winder does seem to include western Switzerland, with Basle and Bern, as proper parts of Lotharingia, which it certainly had nothing to do with after 888 -- only 33 years since 855 -- with no remaining memory of Lothar, which is not surprising with only a 33 year interlude.\n\nEven worse, Winder refers to Lenin's time in Zürich, before the Germans shipped him off to Russia, as how the \"strange Lotharingian exceptionalism first protected Lenin...\" [p.423]. But Zürich is east of the River Reuss and so was always part of Swabia, and East Francia, and neither Burgundy nor Lorraine nor Francia Media. Winder has taken his excuse of considering some of Switzerland as \"Lotharingia\" and then carelessly generalizing it, apparently, to all of Switzerland. The origin of Switzerland is unrelated to events in Lorraine or Lotharingia.\n\nSo Simon Winder, who has a book subtitled A Personal History of Europe's Lost Country, appears to suffer from ignorance or neglect of another \"Lost Country,\" namely Burgundia, which has a longer history, with deeper roots (back to the actual Burgundians), than Lotharingia. Winder should consult Phoenix Frustrated, the Lost Kingdom of Burgundy, by Christopher Cope [Constable, London, 1986; Dodd, Mead & Company, New York, 1987]. Yet Winder does seem to cite the Burgundy chapter, \"Burgundia: Five, Six or Seven Kingdoms (c.411-1795)\" in Vanished Kingdoms, The Rise and Fall of States and Nations, by Norman Davies [Viking, 2011]. Writing about one \"lost kingdom,\" Winder needed to absorb more about this other one, which does not seem to have fully registered with him. We also shouldn't forget the \"lost country\" of Navarre, whose history straddles Spain and France.\n\nBut Burgundy does eventually enter the story, since the Dukes of Burgundy end up with most of Lower Lorraine, which by then (ironically) has lost its own name and takes on the Burgundian identity. Perhaps that is the \"revenge of Burgundy\" because Winder, after the fact, ignored its existence. So, not only do we never get any background about the Kingdom(s) of Burgundy, or the Duchy, or the Free County, but I can't tell that the unified Kingdom ever gets mentioned, except for one reference to its capital, Arles, and a mention that the Dukes of Burgundy wanted to reconstitute the Kingdom. The actual early history is missing, which, perhaps, we might expect if parts of Burgundia are to be confused with Lotharingia and their identity ignored. When we get some details about the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the central figure is Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and we seem to be only incidentally informed that the leader of the victorious army was René II of Guise, Duke of Lorraine, the rest of whose life and history is missing, with many more details nevertheless given about Charles, even though we might expect the main story to be about René's domain, and perhaps even the House of Anjou (the basis of the claim of Charles VIII to Naples), not that of Charles.\n\nWhile devoting considerable attention to Switzerland, Flanders, and Alsace, which were not part of Lotharingia, Winder neglects some areas that were. Thus, he says:\n\nThis is not the place to get too involved in the Lotharingian vagaries of the Duchy of Bar, but it was split in two parts by the River Meuse -- one owning allegiance to France (the enjoyably named 'Barrois mouvant') and the other in the Empire (the 'Barrois non mouvant'). [p.119]\n\nThe problem here is that Bar, all of it, was most definitely part of Lotharingia, which makes me wonder why Winder doesn't want to get \"too involved\" with something that his book is supposed to be about. That is especially important when \"Barrois mouvant\" was not originally part of France, according to Winder's own map showing the boundaries of \"The Treaty of Verdun 843\" [p.xiv]. In 1301 Philip IV of France forced his sovereignty on Bar west of the Meuse. Even then, according to Winder's own map again [p.xvii], parts of Imperial Loraine remained west of the Meuse, and parts of French Bar were east of it (clarifed by the Historischer Weltatlas by Dr. Walter Leisering, Marixverlag, Verlagshaus Römerweg GmbH, Wiesbaden, 1997, 2016, pp.70,74, with glosses of \"z[u].Barr.mouv.\").\n\nThus, we can see that the original western boundary of Lotharingia was at least midway between the Meuse and the Marne, and then moves east. This is an important part of the story of Lorraine, where the long story is of France eventually seizing all of what had become the Duchy of Lorraine, with all the territories, like the independent Bishoprics, around it. The attack on Bar, where Bar-le-Duc was originally founded precisely to be a frontier defense against West Francia (or perhaps, in particular, against the Counts of Champagne), was the first, ominous move against Lorraine. I would say this neglect is a grave oversight for Winder in what is supposed to be a dedicated history of Lotharingia.\n\nIndeed, in Winder's entire book, there seems to be a lot more about Flanders, Switzerland, and Alsace than about what eventually became the Duchy of Lorraine, simpliciter, or any other proper part of Lotharingia, itself -- and quite a bit about Basle (Basel, Bâle), which was part of Swabia, like Alsace.\n\nFor which I should pause a moment, because, where many of the historical maps are ambiguous, another map at Wikipedia explicitly shows Alsace as part of Lothar's original domain, but ceded to Swabia in 925 -- with the dotted red line as the lingusitic boundary between French and German. That would have been under the Duke Gilbert of Mons (916-939), at the very time when he shifted the suzerainty of Lorraine from West to East Francia. This, of course, whould be enough to motivate Simon Winder to make Alsace, with Basle, a permanent part of his Lotharingia -- while this map, incidentally, also properly shows the area south of historical Lorraine as part of Burgundy.\n\nIndeed, there's the rub. Winder seems to devote more attention to areas that were not part of Lothar's domain long enough to acquire the identity of \"Lotharingia\" or \"Lorraine\" than to those that did. Thus, despite a lot of attention devoted, appropriatedly, to the Netherlands, we are missing an account of how Lower Lorraine lost its identity, which was absorbed and dispersed to Brabant, Utrecht, Limburg, Liège, Holland and other domains. When did the Duchy of Upper Lorraine just become \"Lorraine\"? I don't know (the guess below is c.1304), and Winder, whose book might have told us something about it, doesn't. The dismissal of the story of Bar as getting us \"too involved\" seems to mean that we are not going to get \"too involved\" in the story of Lorraine itself, while devoting time to an account of Lenin's exile in Zürich, which by no reckoning, even Winder's, was ever part of Lotharingia.\n\nWhile the lapses in Simon Winder's book are annoying, perhaps we should keep in mind that it is \"A Personal History\" and not a strict scholarly, historical account. There certainly is no strict chronology in the narrative. Winder likes walking around, and his peripatetic visits here in Flanders, Alsace, Basle, or Switzerland reflect what interests him and what didn't fit into his previous books (Germania, 2010, and Danubia, 2013). In those terms, perhaps he can be forgiven for confusing, in effect, Zürich with Nancy. I must confess, however, that I had missed that Lothar II was given part of Burgundy, or Alsace.\n\nReviews\n\nPart of my problem with the origin of Lotharingia has been the incompleteness of my sources. Thus, I have thought I could rely on the Historischer Weltatlas. If the Germans haven't got it right, I don't know who will. But the Weltatlas skips the division of Francia between the sons of Lothar I [p.39]. We get a nice map of Verdun in 843, but then it jumps to the division of Mersen in 870, which sorted out the Empire after the deaths of Lothar II (d.869) and Charles of Burgundy (d.863), and finally to the division of Ribemont in 880, when Charles III the Fat (876-888) has taken over from the Emperor Louis II (d.875). Since Louis II the German takes Lothar II's land down to Lake Geneva, we already have the alienation of Upper Burgundy from Lotharingia -- 15 years rather than the 33 years mentioned above. Charles the Fat then ends up with all of Upper Burgundy, which is thus permanently returned to the Burgundian heritage. Dr. Leisering already shows Upper Burgundy as a distinct domain within the possession of Charles the Fat. Only Boso in Lower Bungundy remains outside the brief unification of Francia by Charles the Fat. From this, I think there is little ground to regard any part of Upper Burgundy, like Switzerland or the Franche Comté, as intrinsic to Lotharingia, as Simon Winder does.\n\nIn 1764 miners near Maastricht found the skull of what would prove to be a Mosasaur. This was the first genuinely prehistoric and extinct animal that would be recognized as such -- although that took a little while. It is often casually said to be a dinosaur; but, no, it is no more than a huge, ocean going lizard. The original discovery did not excite much attention, but another skull, apparently turned up between 1770 and 1774, did the trick. Johann Leonard Hoffmann, a local surgeon and fossil collector, spread the word, with inquiries, and generated, not just considerable interest, but fame.\n\nWhen France invaded the Netherlands in 1794, the fossil was stolen -- an extraordinary part of the loot of Empire -- and sent to Paris. There its nature was debated, and its character as a lizard was identified by Adriaan Gilles Camper, ironically a Dutchman, in 1799. Georges Cuvier, who was said to be able to reconstruct an entire animal from one bone, and who first demonstrated that there were extinct animals (a thesis that originally was thought to offend the wisdom of God), agreed with the identification in 1808. It turned out that fragments of Mosasaurs had previously been unearthed, without their character being recognized. And, after 1815, the stolen Mosasaur fossils were returned to Maastricht.\n\nThe name \"Mosasaur,\" which is the key matter of interest here, was bestowed by William Conybeare in 1822. This was the Mosa, \"Meuse,\" saurus, \"lizard.\" Since the Mosasaur actually was a lizard, this was more appropriate than names like \"dinosaur,\" \"terrible lizard,\" where dinosaurs actually aren't lizards.\n\nI first encountered a Mosasaur in the Texas Memorial Museum at the University of Texas at Austin. This was the rather full skeleton of the \"Onion Creek Mosasaur,\" which we see at right, with one of its discovers, W. Clyde Ikins. Ikins and John P. Smith discovered the fossil in 1935, not far from Austin itself, Onion Creek being a tributary of the Colorado River, which flows through Austin. Texas and North-Western Europe share in large deposits of Cretacious limestone, laid down by the seas within which Mosasaurs swam.\n\nIn the movie Jurassic World [2015], we see a marine stadium, like at Sea World, that features, not performing dolphins or the like, but a Mosasaur that jumps up and does tricks like the dolphins otherwise would have. In the original Jurassic Park [1990], the denouement of the movie is when a Tyrannosaurus, which had been terrorizing and killing everyone, appears and rescues the surviving cast members from Velociraptors. In Jurassic World, a genetically engineered hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus rex, which has been rampaging and fending off (friendly?) Velociraptors and the original Tyrannosaurus, is eaten by the suddenly appearing Mosasaur. In the sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom [2018] the Mosasaur is released into the ocean; and at the end of the film it appears swimming within a large wave, right below surfers on the surface, a shot featured in many previews of the movie. We don't see the kind of mayhem it might cause. The movies don't tell us that the creature is named after the Meuse River.\n\nThus is the Meuse immortalized in Paleontology, at the very beginning of the discoveries and revelations that would characterize the understanding of the history of life in the 19th Century. But then we also get the phenomenon that many people think that all ancient animals were dinosaurs, when often they were not.\n\nPhilosophy of Science, Geology and Astronomy\n\nBy 1301, France obtained suzerainty over Bar west of the Meuse, which brought the border of the Kingdom of France to the Meuse itself (more or less). In 1648, France obtained key bridgeheads over the Meuse at Verdun and over the Moselle at Toul and Metz, both deep in Lorraine itself -- all with the justification that the area was French speaking. The Duchy was clearly the target of French ambitions, and the whole of it was occupied several times and finally annexed in 1766. After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany retrieved the part of Lorraine around Metz, until after World War I.\n\nMeanwhile, it was gradually forgotten that Lower Lorraine had been Lorraine at all. The Duchy proper came to be the equivalent of the Duchy of Brabant, and the Low Countries developed their own identity, especially as possessions of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. Most of what was originally Lower Lorraine is now independent as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg (though Luxembourg may originally have been part of Upper Lorraine). Nevertheless, the Cross of Lorraine, used by Charles de Gaulle for the Free French forces of World War II, and associated with Joan (Jeanne) of Arc (from Domremy on the Meuse) -- both in relation to Upper Lorraine -- goes back, apparently, to a Duke of Lower Lorraine, Godfrey of Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade who became the first Crusader ruler of Jerusalem. Today, the Low Countries are the most densely populated of Europe, and among the most prosperous. Luxembourg has the highest per capita income in the world, both absolutely and in relation to purchasing power. Belgium, although troubled with high unemployment, is the administrative center of the European Union.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nCopyright (c) 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2019, 2021, 2022 Kelley L.

The Duchy then soon divided, into Upper Lorraine and Lower Lorraine (959). These went their separate ways, with Lower Lorraine eventually losing its identity into Brabant and Upper Lorraine becoming simply \"Lorraine\" proper. The whole area fragmented in typical feudal fashion. France began to encroach in the south, and in 1648 began the encirclement and consumption of the Duchy of Lorraine with gains in Alsace. By the end of the reign of Louis XIV, Alsace was completely French (although German speaking and disaffected, and with a Jewish population that had earlier been expelled from France) and Lorraine had been occupied several times. Louis XV would finish the job in 1766. The French also had designs on the Lower domains, with the goal of restoring the Rhine frontier of Roman Gaul. The goal was achieved during the era of the French Revolution, but in the end that was reversed, thanks to the defeat of Napoleon; and the French assault on the Low Countries was finally less successful than to the south, despite considerably more open war over the centuries. The Dutch, who had rebelled against Hapsburg Spain, ended up as allies of Spain and Austria in holding the line against France. Flanders (detached from France itself), Hainault, Brabant, and more -- the Spanish Netherlands -- passed to Austria (1713), then to the Netherlands (1815), and finally became independent as Belgium (1830). Even then, it was twice an avenue of invasion for Germany into France (1914 & 1940). Engulfed by France, (Upper) Lorraine fades from memory, now usually only remembered in relation to the part that was held by Germany from 1871 to 1918. That was the part that, like Alsace, may still have been least partly German speaking. But no plebiscite was ever held in Lorraine (or in Alsace), either when it was taken by Germany or when returned to France. Today, the Low Countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, are the most populous part of Europe and major centers of industry. Luxembourg actually has the highest per capita income in the world. In economic freedom, the Netherlands and Luxembourg rate even with the United States, though Belgium is burdened with socialist inhibitions about as much as Germany. Belgium is also the seat of the Parliament for the whole European Union.\n\nDukes of Lotharingia,\n\nLothringen, or Lorraine ZwentiboldKing,\n\n895-900 Gebhard of FranconiaDuke,\n\n900-910 Reginar Longneck\n\nof Mons911-915 adheres to West Francia, 911 Gilbert (Giselbert)\n\nof Mons916-939 returned to East Francia, 925;\n\nson-in-law of Emperor Henry I,\n\n928; defeated by Otto I, Battle of\n\nAndernach, drowned fleeing\n\nacross the Rhine, 939.

When Zwentibold died in 900, a German nobleman, Gebhard of Franconia, was appointed by the East Frankish court. Gebhard was thus no King but was beginning to be called a Dux (Herzog), the title of a Roman frontier military commander. Before long, this became the special title for one of the divisions of East Francia, the Stem Duchies. Lorraine thus became a \"duchy.\" After the death of the last Eastern Carolingian, Louis the Child, in 911, Lorraine became for a while a matter of dispute between Eastern and Western Franks, with the power of local nobility consequently becoming more important. After Gebhard, chief among these was Rainier (or Reginar) of Mons (or Maasgau). Rainier transferred the allegiance of Lorraine to the West Frankish Carolingian, Charles (III) the Simple. In 923 Charles was deposed in the West by the Count of Paris, but Lorraine remained faithful to him until 925. Then Rainier's son Giselbert (Gislebert or Gilbert) returned to the East Frankish King, now Henry I of Saxony. Giselbert thus stands as the first Duke of Lorraine for its subsequent history as a division of East Francia (Germany).\n\nAlthough Hainault (Hennegau) continued for some time in the family of Rainier, the Duchy of Lorraine itself fell to the disposal of the East Frankish Kings, who preferred to have in-laws or relatives in control, though this did not always guarantee loyalty, as the revolt of Conrad the Red demonstrated. The brother of Otto I, Archbishop Bruno (or Brun) was loyal and kept the peace. In 959 he also divided the Duchy, into Upper Lorraine (Oberlothringen) and Lower Lorraine (Niederlothringen), a division that had become permanent by 1044.\n\nOberlothringen,\n\nUpper LorraineNiederlothringen,\n\nLower Lorraine Frederick I of\n\nthe ArdennesUpper Lorraine\n\n959-978;\n\nMargrave\n\nuntil 965Godfrey I\n\nof Metz\n\n& HainaultLower Lorraine\n\n959-964,\n\nMargrave Richard/RicharLower Lorraine\n\n964-972,\n\nMargrave Thierry/\n\nDietrich IUpper Lorraine\n\n978-1026,\n\nDukeCharles\n\nthe CarolingianLower Lorraine\n\n977-991, Duke Frederick IIUpper Lorraine\n\n1026/27Otto the\n\nCarolingianLower Lorraine\n\n991-1012 Frederick IIIUpper Lorraine\n\n1026/27-1033Godfrey I (II)\n\nof VerdunLower Lorraine\n\n1012-1023 Upper Lorraine\n\n1033-1044Gozelo (Gothelo) I of VerdunLower Lorraine\n\n1023-1044 Upper Lorraine\n\n1044-1047Godfrey II (III)\n\nthe BeardedGozelo II\n\nthe SluggardLower Lorraine\n\n1044-1046 Adalbert\n\nof MetzFrederick\n\nof LuxemburgLower Lorraine\n\n1046-1065 Lower Lorraine\n\n1065-1069 Upper Lorraine\n\n1047-1048Godfrey III (IV)\n\nthe HunchbackLower Lorraine\n\n1069-1076 Gerard of MetzUpper Lorraine\n\n1048-1070 Thierry/\n\nDietrich IIUpper Lorraine\n\n1070-1115Conrad,\n\nVII of FranconiaLower Lorraine\n\n1076-1087,\n\nd.1101 son of Emperor Henry IV Godfrey IV (V)\n\nof BouillonLower Lorraine\n\n1087-1100 Protector of\n\nJerusalem,\n\n1099-1100 Henry I\n\nof LimburgLower Lorraine\n\n1101-1106,\n\nd.1119 Simon IUpper Lorraine\n\n1115-1139Godfrey V (VI)\n\nthe Bearded,\n\nCount of\n\nLouvain/Löwen\n\n& BrabantLower Lorraine\n\n1106-1128,\n\nd.1139 brother of Thierry,\n\nCount of FlandersWalram\n\nof LimburgLower Lorraine\n\n1128-1139 Matthew IUpper Lorraine\n\n1139-1176Godfrey VII,\n\nCount of\n\nLouvain &\n\nBrabantLower Lorraine\n\n1139-1142 Godfrey VIIILower Lorraine\n\n1142-1183,\n\nd.1190 Simon IIUpper Lorraine\n\n1176-1205,\n\nd.1207Henry IIDuke of Lower\n\nLorraine\n\n& Brabant\n\n1183-1235 Frederick I\n\n(Ferry) (IV)Upper Lorraine\n\n1205-1206,\n\nd.1207 Frederick II\n\n(Ferry) (V)\n\nof BitschUpper Lorraine\n\n1206-1213 Thiébaut\n\nTheobald IUpper Lorraine\n\n1213-1220 Matthew IIUpper Lorraine\n\n1220-1251Henry IIILower Lorraine\n\n& Brabant\n\n1235-1248 Frederick III\n\n(Ferry) (VI)Upper Lorraine\n\n1251-1303Henry IVLower Lorraine\n\n& Brabant\n\n1248-1261 Henry VLower Lorraine\n\n& Brabant\n\n1261-1267,\n\nd.1272 John/Johann/\n\nJan I the\n\nVictoriousBrabant\n\n1267-1294;\n\nDuchy of Lower\n\nLorraine lapses;\n\nDuke of\n\nLimburg, 1283 Thiébaut\n\nTheobald IIUpper Lorraine\n\n1304-1312,\n\ncontinued as\n\nLorraineJohn II\n\nthe PeacefulBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1294-1312 Frederick IV\n\n(Ferry) (VII)Lorraine\n\n1312-1328John III\n\nthe TriumphantBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1312-1355 Rudolf1328-1346Joan/JohannaDuchess of\n\nBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1355-1404,\n\nd.1406 John I1346-1390 Charles I\n\nthe Bold1390-1431Wenceslas\n\nof LuxemburgDuke of\n\nLuxemburg\n\n1353-1383, &\n\nBrabant\n\n1355-1383 MargaretBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1404-1405 Anthony of\n\nBurgundyBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1405-1415 William/John IVBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1415-1427 Philip of St.PolBrabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1427-1430 Isabel/\n\nIsabella1431-1453Philip the Good\n\nof BurgundyDuke of\n\nBurgundy\n\n1419-1467 Brabant\n\n& Limburg\n\n1430-1467 Marries René\n\nthe Good of AnjouUnion of Brabant,\n\nLimburg, & Burgundy, 1430\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about the earliest years of Lower Lorraine -- or at least it has not always been easy getting the picture from my sources. Both of the Stammtafeln cited below, Adreas Thiele and Michael F. Feldkamp, do not give any Dukes before Charles the Carolingian. This bumps around the subsequent numbering of the Godfreys, of whom there are many. In those terms, one is left with the impression that St. Bruno retained Lower Lorraine until this death, which would leave a considerable hiatus, 965-977. Nothing wrong with that; but Bruce R. Gordon does give the intermediate Dukes listed above. Now I also find them at Wikipedia with a bit more explanation. Bruno did not formally abdicate from either Upper or Lower Lorraine, but he did appoint vice-Dukes or Margraves, Frederick of the Ardennes and Godfrey of Metz. Godfrey was also the Count of Hainault, and I originally had him confused with a cousin of Frederick, Godfrey \"the Prisoner\" of Verdun. Now they seem different, although Thiele says that Godfrey was also Count of Hainault, 959-978. Perhaps I am not the only one confused here. Godfrey's successor, Richar, seems to be of obscure origin, and it is after him that we do get a short interregnum, 972-977, before Charles the Carolingian.\n\nThe \"Cross of Lorraine\" is supposed to have been used by Godfrey of Bouillon on the First Crusade. The upper bar may render the plaque (the Titulus) that announced Jesus \"King of the Jews.\" Later the cross was adopted by Charles de Gaulle as the symbol of the Free French in World War II. The association here may be with the \"Maid of Lorraine,\" who was supposed to have been foretold by Merlin to deliver France from her enemies -- and was then identified as Joan of Arc (d.1431).\n\nIn classic feudal fashion, the holdings of the actual Dukes of Upper and Lower Lorraine shrank to a mere core of the Duchies, as peripheral fiefs became alienated. Upper Lorraine retreated from the Rhine and acquired local rivals in the form of the Dukes of Luxemburg. When Lower Lorraine fell to the Counts of Brabant, they promoted Brabant to a Duchy. In time the identity of Lower Lorraine lapsed and the Dukes were simply the Dukes of Brabant.\n\nBrabant eventually fell to the Dukes of Burgundy, along with Flanders, a fief of France, and other former fiefs of Lower Lorraine, Hainault, Holland, Limburg, Namur, and Luxemburg. Ironically, this has conferred an identity on the Low Countries as \"Burgundian\" even though previously they had nothing to do with Burgundy, which was merely adjacent to Lorraine to the south. The attempt of Charles the Bold of Burgundy to bring Upper Lorraine into his domain (1475), and so to reunite the whole original Duchy, resulted in his death in battle at Nancy in 1477 -- an event that brought the Hapsburgs into the Low Countries. Eventually this meant that the Spanish Army in the Netherlands worse the red \"Cross of Burgundy\" as its insignia.\n\nIn the same era, Upper Lorraine itself, henceforth Lorraine proper, passed by marriage to the French Dukes of Anjou and Bar. This made Lorraine, which was largely French speaking itself, increasingly a part of French history and a target for acquisition by the French Crown. Nevertheless, the heiress of Anjou, Yolande, married her own cousin, who was a descendant in the male line from John I of Lorraine. The subsequent house of Anjou-Lorraine thus was still the patrilineal House of Metz. Even later, the House of Lorraine-Hapsburg was still actually the House of Metz.\n\nUpper Lorraine begins with the House of the Ardennes, which accounts for all the Dukes down to Adelbert of Metz, and many of the Dukes of Lower Lorraine. It should be noted that Count Siegfried founds the line of Luxemburg. The Ardennes genealogy ends here with Godfrey of Bouillon, who leads the First Crusade. He becomes \"Protector\" of Jerusalem, but his brother Baldwin founds the line of Kings of Jerusalem. The Counts of Metz lead to all the later Dukes of Upper Lorraine and of Lorraine. An earlier \"Godfrey of Metz\" is given by some sources as Duke of Lower Lorraine, 959-964, but I have been unable to confirm this. The House of Metz also becomes, for a while, the rulers of Flanders.\n\nLiège was a bishopric in Lower Lorraine that grew into an eccesiastical state with secular authority, such as would become common in the Empire. Bishop Notger began the secular power of the bishopric in 980 when he became Count of Huy. Eventually, the domain of the Bishop stretched in a thin band north to south entirely across what would be the modern territory of Belgium.\n\nLiège itself remains one of the major cities on the Meuse River. Given the linguistic complexity of the region, we get multiple versions of the name of the city. In Latin, it is Leodium [1]. In Dutch and Flemish it is Luik [2]. In French, until 1949 the city was Liége [3], but then the accent was shifted from acute to grave [4]. In the dialect of French in Belgium, however, Walloon, the name is Lidje [5]. English now uses the French name; but there used to be an English version of the Dutch name, Luick [6]. And then there is the name in German, Lüttich [7].\n\nPrince-Bishops\n\nof Liège,\n\n972-1794 Notger972-1008 Baldrick II1008-1018 Wolbodo1018-1021 Durandus1021-1025 Reginard1025-1037 Nithard1037-1042 Wazo1042-1048 Theodwin1048-1075 Henry of Verdun1075-1091 Otbert1091-1119 Frederick of Namur1119-1121 Albero I of Leuven1122-1128 Alexander I1128-1135 Albero II of Chiny-Namur1135-1145 Henry II of Leez1145-1164 Alexander II1164-1167 Rudolf of Zähringen1167-1191 Saint Albert of Leuven1191-1192 Lothaire of Hochstaden1192-1193 Simon of Limbourg1193-1195 Albert of Cuyck1195-1200 Hugh of Pierrepont1200-1229 John of Eppes1229-1238 William of Savoy1238-1239 Robert of Thourotte1240-1246 Henry of Guelders1247-1274 John of Enghien1274-1281 John of Flanders1282-1291 Hugh of Chalon1295-1301 Adolph of Waldeck1301-1302 Thibaut of Bar1302-1312 Adolph of La Marck1313-1344 Englebert of La Marck1345-1364 John of Arckel1364-1378 Arnold of Hornes1378-1389 John of Bavaria1389-1418 John of Walenrode1418-1419 John of Heinsberg1419-1455 Louis of Bourbon1456-1482 John of Hornes1484-1505 Erard of La Marck1505-1538 Corneille of Berghes1538-1544 George of Austria1544-1557 Robert of Berghes1557-1564 Gerard of Grsbeek1564-1580 Ernest of Bavaria1581-1612 Ferdinand of Bavaria1612-1650 Maximilian Henry of Bavaria1650-1688 John Louis of Elderen1688-1694 Joseph Clemens of Bavaria1694-1723 Georges-Louis de Berghes1724-1743 Jean-Théodore of Bavaria1744-1763 Charles- Nicolas d'Oultremont1763-1771 François- Charles de Velbruck1772-1784 César- Constantin- François de Hœnsbrœck1784-1792 François- Antoine-Marie de Méan1792-1794 occupied by France, 1974; annexed to France, 1795; the Netherlands, 1815; Belgium, 1830\n\nThrough most of its history, Liège, as an ecclesiastical state, may have remained relatively immune to the events swirling around it. Nevertheless, it occasionally became a target in the conflicts of the area, being destroyed by Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1468, and then captured by the Duke of Marlborough in 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession -- because at that point the Prince- Bishop, Joseph Clemens, was a Wittelsbach, the family of the Dukes of Bavaria, who were allies of the French. The last Prince-Bishops became enthusiasts of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution; but then the Revolution devoured such an anachronism as the ecclesiastical state. Liège became part of France, with its Rhine frontier, until the overthrow of Napoleon.\n\nIn all of history, however, never did Liège have a more important moment than in August 1914, long after the days of the Prince-Bishops. The Right Wing of the German Army, intending to invade France through Belgium, planned to cross the Meuse at Liège. The Belgians had built twelve forts ringing the city. The forts were not entirely up to date, but it was expected that they were good enough to seriously slow the German advance -- the Germans were hoping that the Belgians would not fight and were rather indignant when they did.\n\nIt had taken the Japanese nine months to take the Russian forts at Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). However, there would be significant differences in the siege of Liège. One reason the Japanese siege took so long was that their siege guns had been sunk at sea. It took six months just to reassemble batteries and get them to Port Arthur. Even so, it was still relatively slow work. But the Germans knew that and were prepared. The Austrians had designed a 305mm (12-inch) mortar and built it at their Skoda works. As the war began, Krupp had just finished manufacturing a larger gun, 420mm (16.5-inch), for Germany. Guns this size were nothing extraordinary on battleships, but moving them around on land was a challenge. It was like moving an obelisk.\n\nInitially, like the Japanese, the Germans hoped that they could take the forts by infantry assault. Like the Japanese, again, the Germans found that they were repulsed with heavy casualties from the forts. This heartened the Belgians and the Allies. The Germans then threatened to bomb Liège with Zepplins unless the city surrendered. It didn't, and the Germans were as good as their word, beginning the 20th Century indiscriminate bombing of a civilian target on August 6, 1914. Nine citizens were killed. This was the beginning of German war crimes in Belgium that became excellent Allied propaganda. While this was often exaggerated, the basic facts were genuine.\n\nSoon, the Germans got through between the forts, and took the city of Liège. Then the siege guns came up. By August 16th, all the forts but three (out of twelve) had been beaten into submission and had either surrendered or were taken by assault. On that day, the headquarters fort, Loncin, whose magazine contained 12 tons of explosives, blew up, almost killing the Belgian commander at Liège, General Gerard Mathieu Leman (1851-1920), who, buried in rubble, was then captured by the Germans. The remaining two forts then surrendered. The Germans went on with their invasion of France. This actually only delayed the German timetable by a couple of days, but even that might have made a difference in the subsequent Battle of the Marne which defeated the German war plan.\n\nThe ruins of the forts of Liège survive today, especially that of Loncin, whose catastrophic end is evident in the twisted and even volcanic remains. Loncin fought to the death, and 350 men of its 550 man garrison remain entombed under the wreckage. The shattered fort, like the Arizona at Pearl Harbor, now stands as a monument and burial ground to the Belgian resistance; and when the clearance of old ordinance and explosives results in the discovery of human remains, these are reburied at the monument. An inscription recalls Simonides: Passant... va dire à la Belgique et à la France qu'ici 550 belges se sont sacrificés pour la défense de la liberté et le salut du monde, \"Passer by... go say to Belgium and France that here 550 Belgians sacrificed themselves for the defense of freedom and the salvation of the world.\" As at Thermopylae, little was gained by this effort, apart from a moral example. But it is enough that we should remember.\n\nAfter the death of Godfrey of Bouillon, Lower Lorraine passes from the House of the Ardennes. There is briefly a tug-of-war between the Counts of Limburg and those of Louvain (Löwen) and Brabant, calling on different sides in the dynastic struggles going on in Germany, before the Brabant line establishes itself. Eventually, in 1283, Limburg itself falls to the Dukes of Brabant. That is also about the time that Lower Lorraine loses its own identity in that of Brabant.\n\nThe chart here begins with the derivation of the house of Hainault (Hennegau) and Louvain, which begins at Mons (Maasgau), includes a couple Dukes of Lorraine, and then divides into Louvain and Hainault. The genealogy of the Counts of Hainault continues with the genealogy of Flanders and then on the page for Hainault itself.\n\nWhen the male line of Brabant fails, one heiress, Johanna, marries Wenceslas of Luxemburg but has no children, and then her sister, Margaret, marries the Count of Flanders, Louis II of Mâle. Their daughter Margaret, the heiress of Flanders and Brabant then marries the first Valois Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold. This adds much of the old Lower Lorraine to the Burgundian inheritance, which ends up in the hands of the Hapsburgs.\n\nToday, Louvain (Leuven in Flemish, Löwen in German), Hainault, Limburg, and Brabant are all in Belgium. The major city of Brabant is now Brussels, the capital of Belgium.\n\nThe genealogy of Mons, Louvain, Hainault, Limburg, and Brabant is drawn from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, pp.14, 16-18, & 20-25].\n\nI have found it infuriatingly difficult to piece together the early history of Lorraine, which tends to fall between the stools in histories of France or Germany. The list of Dukes was originally constructed simply using Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. I was able to add some details and alternative names from Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. For a while the only real history of the early Duchies that I was able to find was part of the Geschichte des Herzogtums Lothringen, by Walter Mohr [Verlag \"die Mitte\", Saarbrücken], Teil I. Geschichte des Herzogtums Groß-Lothringen (900-1048) [1974] and Teil II. Niederlothringen bis zu seinem Aufgehen im Herzogtum Brabant (11-13.Jahrhundert) [1976]. Two further volumes carry the history down to 1670, but Mohr does not provide much in the way of helpful supplements. Only Volume II has a map (without boundaries) and a list of rulers, and there are no genealogical charts. The list, however, is especially useful, since the Dukes of Lower Lorraine from 1046 to 1139 were a mixture of different families, most of whom are difficult to find, if they are there, in Thompsett's database. An English narrative of the early history of Lorraine is now available in The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III, c.900-c.1024 [Timothy Reuter, editor, Cambridge, 1999, pp.310-327]. At least one detail on the genealogical chart [p.697, on Dukes Godfrey I and Gozelo I], however, contradicts the plain statement of the text [p.322]. The obscurity of the history of Lower Lorraine seems especially unfortunate considering that today its territories are largely independent in the form of the modern Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The Low Countries are what remain of an independent Lorraine, though they are really never referred to that way. Burgundy, if anything, is what is remembered. After all this trouble piecing things together, now I have been able to obtain the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997], which covers Lorraine from pages 63 to 76. With this detailed source I have produced the genealogical diagrams for Lorraine (and Bar) before the house of Anjou-Lorraine (which I had constructed from the earlier sources).\n\nThe history of the County and Duchy of Bar is an important part of the history of Lorraine and so is included here, before passing on to the house of Anjou-Lorraine below. The Duke Frederick I of Upper Lorraine (959-978) builds a fortress at Bar, now the modern city of Bar-le-Duc, because this lay on the border with the West Frankish Kingdom (i.e. France), although at the time there was no threat from that direction,\n\nCounts &\n\nDukes of Bar Rainald ICount,\n\n1102-1149 Rainald II1149-1170 Henry I1170-1190 Theobald I1190-1214 Count of\n\nLuxemburg,\n\n1197-1214 Henry II1214-1239 Theobald II1239-1291 Henry III1291-1302 Vassal of France,\n\n1301 Edward I1302-1336 Henry IV1336-1344 Edward II1344-1352 Robert1352-1411,\n\nDuke, 1354 Edward III1411-1415 Louis1415-1431 René\n\nof Anjou1431-1480\n\nsince the kingdom was fragmenting into its worst state of feudal particularism. In 987, Hugh Capet, Frederick's own brother-in-law, would be elected West Frankish King and begin the process of restoring royal power. Later, the Duke Frederick II (1027-1033) has a grandson, Dietrich I, who is enfeoffed with Bar. Dietrich's son Rainald then becomes the first Count of Bar.\n\nAs time passes, French royal power waxes. Count Henry III of Bar is defeated and captured by King Philip IV in 1301. Philip forced Henry into accepting that he would be a vassal of France for all of Bar west of the Meuse (Maas in German) River. This became the \"royal Bar\" or Barrois mouvant, \"dependant Bar.\" Bar east of the Meuse, still in the Duchy of Lorraine, was then \"ducal Bar\" or Barrois non mouvant, \"non-dependant Bar\" (St-Mihiel, Pont-à-Mousson, & Longwy) This alteration was both the symbolic and real beginning of the French move to the East, into the lands of historic Lotharingia. The boundary between the two was originally about midway between the Marne and the Meuse. As Bar to the Meuse becomes a French fief, the French domain also presses towards in the Meuse around the often detached pieces of Bar. I see no account of the details of this.\n\nIt is of some interest because Joan (Jeanne) of Arc, who was identified as the foretold \"Maid of Lorraine,\" was from the village of Domrémy, which is on the west bank of the Meuse. In 1429 Joan travels north to Vaucouleurs, also on the west bank of the Meuse, in order to get an escort to see King Charles VII. This city was in between northern (Ligny-en-Barrois) and southern (Gondrecourt) fragments of Bar. I would like to know when (if it did) it came under French royal control. I have some maps that show both Vaucouleurs and Domrémy in Bar itself. However, we have the testimony of Joan in her own words about the status of Domrémy, for she testified, \"This voice... told me it was necessary for me to come into France... it said to me two or three times a week: 'You must go into France'.\" So, if she must leave Domrémy to \"go into France,\" Domrémy cannot yet have been in France already.\n\nThe next significant events are the inheritance of Bar by the Anjou Duke of Lorraine, René I, and then the reversion of the Lands of Anjou to the French Throne in 1481. Some sources say that this includes Bar. However, maps with other sources show the royal Barrois still an independent fief at the end of the 16th century. Nevertheless, subsequent maps in most sources show it under Royal control, without any indication of when the transition occurred. Ducal Bar remained, of course, a possession of the Dukes of Lorraine.\n\nIsabel, the Heiress of Lorraine, marries a grandson of Duke Louis I of Anjou, son of King John II of France. Here the family tree for that line is given, which includes all subsequent Dukes of Lorraine, and the Dukes of Guise also, followed by the table for the Dukes of Lorraine.\n\nHenry, 3rd Duke of Guise, pressed a claim to the French Throne, but ended up getting assassinated. His aunt, Mary of Guise, married James V of Scotland, which means that all subsequent rulers of Scotland and England, through her grandson James VI (James I of England), are her descendants. This Mary is easily confused with her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. In the 1998 movie, Elizabeth, with Cate Blanchett, Mary puts in an appearance, without explanation. That is particularly confusing, since many people who never would have heard of Mary of Guise nevertheless might know that Elizabeth later executed Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nRené (Renatus) I the Good of Anjou1431-1453,\n\nd.1480 John I1453-1470 Nicholas I1470-1473 Yolanda1473-1483 marries Frederick VI of Lorraine (Ferri II of Guise) René II of Guise1473-1508 defeated and killed Charles the Bold of Burgundy,\n\nBattle of Nancy, 1477 Anthony \"il Buono\"1508-1544 Francis I1544-1545 Nicholas II1545-1552, d.1577 Charles II1552-1608 Henry1608-1624 Nicola1624-1656 married to Charles III, Duke of Lorraine Francis II1624-1525, d.1632 Charles III (IV)1625-1634, 1659-1675 married to Nicola, Dutchess of Lorraine; Duchy of Bar lost to France, 1634; Lorraine occupied by France, 1634-1641, 1644-1661, & 1670-1697 Nicholas Francis1634-1659, d.1670 Charles IV (V) Leopold1675-1690 Commands Left Wing of Christian Relief Army at Siege of Vienna, 1683; Commands Imperial Army, defeats Turks, takes Budapest, 1686; War of the League of Augsburg, 1688-1697 Leopold Joseph1690-1729 Lorraine recovered from France, 1697, occupied by France again, 1702-1714 Francis III Stephen1729-1736 Duke of Tuscany, 1738-1745 Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor 1745-1765 married to Maria Theresa Hapsburg, heiress of Austria; War of the Polish Succession, 1733-1735; Lorraine to Stanislaw Lesczinski, 1736 Stanislaw Lesczinski1736-1766 Marie Lesczinskaheiress\n\nof Lorraine married to Louis XV of France; Lorraine Passes to France, 1766\n\nFrance got its bridgehead across the Meuse in 1552, when the bishoprics of Metz, Verdun, and Toul were ceded in exchange for French help for the German Protestants against the Emperor Charles V. Charles tried to recover the cities, but failed. Then, in 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia, ending the Thirty Years War, formally gave the cities to France, along with many other small territories and cities in Lorraine and Alsace, including the fortress of Belfort. Verdun was right on the east bank of the Meuse, but Metz and Toul were on the Moselle (Mosel in German), the heart of Lorraine. Louis XIV managed to obtain all of Alsace in the course of his wars, but Lorraine, although frequently occupied, escaped his grasp. Alsace, of course, not in Lotharingia at all, but historically part of the Duchy of Swabia (and German speaking, unlike Lorraine), lies on the west bank of the Rhine, the goal of French ambitions to restore the ancient boundaries of Roman Gaul.\n\nThe main line of Dukes of Lorraine ends with Francis III, who married Maria Theresa of Hapsburg and thus stands at the head of the entire subsequent House of Hapsburg-Lorraine. As part of the negotiations by the Emperor Charles VI to secure Maria Theresa's inheritance (the \"Pragmatic Sanction\" to set aside the Salic Law against female succession), following the War of the Polish Succession (1733-1735), Francis agreed to cede Lorraine to Stanislaw Lesczinski, the unsuccessful French candidate for the Polish Throne. Since Lesczinski's daughter was the Queen of France, his death meant the acquisition of Lorraine by King Louis XV, fulfilling the longstanding French design on the Duchy. Thus, ironically, France acquires Lorraine from the French House of Anjou by way of this House becoming heirs of the Hapsburgs. The French acquisition of Lorraine alarmed Europe at the time, but nothing much could be, or was, done about it. Germans remained more incensed about the French acquisition of Alsace.\n\nWhen France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), and the German Empire was created, Alsace and part of Lorraine were annexed by Germany. The heart of Lorraine, around Nancy, was left with France, but the north, around Metz, was taken. I am curious why the Germans didn't take all of it. Since most of the area was French speaking, they may have restrained themselves for that reason. Indeed, that is what it looks like. Even today, there is a population of speakers of Franconian German in the part of Lorraine east of Metz that was taken by Germany. How many there are is a matter of some dispute. In 1999 the French Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques (INSEE) counted 78,000 adult speakers of Lorraine Franconian (francique mosellan, platt lorrain, or platt mosellan in French). In Alsace, about 39% of the adult population (548,000 people) still speaks Alsatian. In our time, when being ruled by someone who doesn't speak your language is generally regarded as \"oppression,\" there is no doubt that the acquisition of Alsace by Louis XIV qualifies. What the situation was when the Germans returned is less clear, although there seems to have been little disaffection with French rule by 1870 and many French fled the areas annexed to Germany -- and Otto von Bismark personally did not want to provoke France by annexing the region. Certainly, the Franconian and Alsatian dialects of German are dying out in France among the young.\n\nThe French vowed to retrieve Alsace and Lorraine. Their prospects looked poor, as Germany grew into the most powerful state on the Continent. Confident in its power, Germany seems to have entered World War I with little in the way of war aims against France except just repeating the triumph of 1871 -- the War had actually started between Austria, Serbia, and Russia. This poorly conceived conflict would cost Germany dear. Lorraine contained a line of forts with which France hoped to hold off Germany: at Belfort, Épinal, Toul, and Verdun. Belfort was actually in Alsace, but, as I see at Wikipedia, it was not annexed by Germany in 1871 (after withstanding a siege during the war) because it was French speaking -- more evidence that the Germans (unlike the French in 1918) were trying to follow the linguistic boundaries. Be that as it may, one of the largest battles of World War I was fought around Verdun, during most of 1916 (February 21st to December 15th). The Germans hoped that the French would exhaust themselves trying to hold the city. Well, both sides rather exhausted themselves, with more than a quarter of a million dead; but the Germans gained nothing of strategic significance. One of the most famous statements of the War is associated with Verdun. Sometimes attributed to Marshal Pétain, it was actually General Robert Nivelle who said Ils ne passeront pas (\"They shall not pass\"). They didn't; and after the Americans joined the War, Germany was defeated and France's borders of 1870 were restored. Reannexed by Hitler, 1940-1945, the conflict over Alsace and Lorraine now seems likely to be only of historical interest.\n\nThe list had some additional corrections from the Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschichte Europas by Michael F.

The same name is now Hainaut in French (the most commonly used), Hennegau in German, Henegouwen in Dutch (and so Flemish), Hinnot in Walloon (i.e. the local dialect of French), and Hénau in Picard (another dialect of French, west and south of Walloon). The real founder of Hainault, Rainier (Reginar) I of Mons (Maasgau), was a Duke of Lorraine and the father of Duke Giselbert of Lorraine. His younger son, Rainier II, inherited Hainault.\n\nMy information on these early Counts has been sketchy. Rainier I's grandfather was the Emperor Lothar I, through his mother, who is either unidentified or given as Irmengard (Ermengarde), which may or may not be a confusion with her mother, Irmengard of Tours, or grandmother (Lother's wife), Irmengard of Hesbain. (My thanks to Dr. Catherine Judd of the University of Miami for drawing this to my attention.) His father was Giselbert of Mons. The early genealogy of this line is given with Lorraine.\n\nFollowing the succession, eventually we arrive at Herman/Hernan. His wife, Richildis, becomes the heiress of Hainault when their son, Roger, becomes Bishop of Châlons. She then marries Baldwin VI of Flanders, from whom the subsequent Counts are derived. At this point the genealogy can be examined for Flanders. As Flanders passes to Robert I, Hainault is detached by the brother of Arnulf III, Baldwin II. Baldwin's descendants continued until Flanders itself is left with an heiress, Margaret, who then marries her cousin, Baldwin V of Hainault. This reunites the houses for some time, encompassing the episode of the Latin Emperors of Romania.\n\nThe union of Flanders and Hainault comes to an end when the Countess Margaret of Flanders leaves Hainault to the son of her first husband, Burchard of Avesnes, and Flanders to the son of her second husband, William of Dampierre. This divides the two counties until later reunion in the domain of Burgundy.\n\nMargaret's first son, John of Avesnes, as it happens, predeceases her, so Hainault falls to her grandson, also John, at her death. This ends up effecting another union, since John's mother, Aleidis, was the daughter of Count Floris IV of Holland. The line of Holland dies out and, in 1399, John, through Aleidis, falls heir. Hainault is henceforth united to Holland, and the full genealogy can be examined at Holland.\n\nTwo more heiresses round out the picture. Margaret II marries the Emperor Louis IV, of the Bavarian Wittelsbachs. This line continues until Jacqueline of Holland, failing to unite her domain by marriage either to France, Brabant, or England, is deposed by Philip the Good of Burgundy. Hainault subsequently passes with the Burgundian inheritance to the Hapsburgs, ultimately to find its place, with most of Flanders, in modern Belgium.\n\nBesides the heiresses, some of the other marriages are noteworthy, as shown in the table here. Count William I marries a sister of Philip VI of France. Even more interesting, one of his other daughters (besides Margaret II) marries King Edward III of England and is the mother of all of his children, all the predecessors of the later English houses of Lancaster and York.\n\nThe genealogy for Hainault can be found in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 2001]. In different sources, there are uncertainties and conflicting dates, and the dates in different charts and tables here sometimes reflect those conflicts.\n\nLorraine Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nCounts & Dukes of Luxemburg\n\n(Luxembourg, Lëtzebuerg)\n\nCounts & Dukes\n\nof Luxemburg Sigfried963-998 Henry I,\n\nV of Bavaria998-1026 Duke of\n\nBavaria,\n\n1005-1009,\n\n1017-1026 Henry II,\n\nVII of Bavaria1026-1047 Duke of\n\nBavaria,\n\n1042-1047 Giselbert1047-1059 Conrad ICount,\n\n1059-1086 Henry III1086-1096 William1096-1129 Conrad II1129-1136 Henry IV\n\nthe Blind\n\nof Namur1136-1196 Ermesinde II1196-1247 TheobaldDuke of Bar,\n\n1190-1214 1197-1214 Walram, IV\n\nof Limburg1214-1226 Duke of\n\nLimburg,\n\n1221-1226 Henry V\n\nof Limburg1247-1281 Henry VI1281-1288 Henry VII1288-1310 Emperor,\n\n1308-\n\n1313 John I the Blind1310-1346 Charles I,\n\nIV of Empire1346-1353 Emperor,\n\n1347-\n\n1378 Wenceslas IDuke,\n\n1353-1383 Wenceslas II,\n\nIV of Bohemia1383-1388,\n\n1411-1412 Emperor,\n\n1378-\n\n1400,\n\nd.1419 Jobst of Moravia1388-1411 Anthony\n\nof Burgundy1412-1415 Elizabeth\n\nof Görlitz1415-1419,\n\n1425-1443,\n\nd.1451 John II\n\nof Burgundy1419-1425,\n\nd.1427 Passes to Burgundy, 1443 [William III\n\nof Saxony]Claimant,\n\n1439-1482 Passes to Hapsburgs, 1482\n\nLuxemburg begins as a castle obtained in 963 by Sigfried, Count of the Ardennes, whose brothers supply many of the early Dukes of Upper Lorraine. By 1060 this has grown into its own County. After a couple of female heirs, both named Ermesinde (or Ermesind), the House of Luxemburg, now actually the House of Limburg, became one of the most important political forces in the 14th century, contending with the Hapsburgs for supremacy in Central Europe. They would be the heirs to the Przemysls in Bohemia (subsequently using the Czech name \"Václav,\" or \"Wenceslas\" in Latin), succeeded to Hungary, and contributed four Emperors, until their own male line came to an end and the Hapsburgs themselves got the pieces (as the two Houses had actually agreed in the Treaty of Brünn in 1364).\n\nThe Emperor Henry VII came in for praise by Dante for, unlike the Hapsburgs, entering Italy and trying to assert Imperial authority. However, this was a hopeless project and a waste of time. More realistic was the regularization of Imperial Elections in the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV in 1356. This prepared the way for the subsequent history of the Empire as a loose confederation with a largely titular sovereign.\n\nAs the Hapsburg Emperor Albert II married the Luxemburg heiress Elizabeth of Bohemia and Hungary, Luxemburg and other former parts of Lower Lorraine became targets of the Dukes of Burgundy. Wenceslas II lost Luxemburg in default of a loan. It ended up passing to his niece Elizabeth of Görlitz. Elizabeth sold the Duchy to Philip the Good of Burgundy, who paid her off in 1444. I am not aware he had any real claim on Luxemburg, except that he wanted it. He had obtained Holland by treating his cousin Jacqueline rather worse in 1433, with, as far as I can tell, a slightly better claim as himself a maternal Wittelsbach. The nature of William of Saxony's claim to the Duchy is detailed at Saxony. In 1477, with the death of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, the Burgundian claims also became Hapsburg claims, as the Heiress Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Hapsburg. Luxemburg would then remain in Hapsburg hands until the French Revolution, then following all of the Austrian Netherlands in union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Unlike other such territories, Luxemburg was considered part of the German Confederation of 1815, and a Prussian garrison was stationed there. When Belgium became independent in 1830, it took with it a large piece of Luxemburg, which was left territorially detached from the Netherlands. In 1890, it then became independent, now usually with a French spelling of its name, \"Luxembourg,\" as detailed below.\n\nI have seen Elizabeth of Görlitz listed on the Internet as the daughter of Wenceslas II. Her genealogy, however, as given here, is shown on page 84 of the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

Dikes (with fingers in them), canals, wooden shoes, windmills, tulips, ice skates -- these are featured in many stories that I remember vividly from my childhood (which was in a place thousands of miles from Holland). However, if you like mountains, you are out of luck. The land is flat as a pancake, with a lot of it below sea level. The occasional powerful storm can break the dikes, change the coastline, and flood the low areas. Sometimes that's useful. The dikes were opened against armies from Spain and France -- in a careful way, with the water too shallow for ships but too deep for marching. Kaisar Wilhelm was threatened with this before World War I. Unfortunately, in World War II the Germans came with paratroopers. Also, the sun is not out much, which means that Dutch painters scrambled when it was.\n\nWith larger issues, a nasty period of religious intolerance -- with the tragic Iconoclast destruction of vast amounts of religious art (religious anaesthesia) -- and a knock-down war, was followed by a history of extraordinary tolerance, welcoming Jews from Spain and Portugal to a status unequalled elsewhere in Europe -- which unfortunately did not translate into full protection for Jews during World War II, when many Dutch joined the SS. Poor Anne Frank was betrayed to the Gestapo. Bad conscience about this may explain why Dutch film maker Paul Verhoeven keeps trying to pin Nazi-equivalence on the World War II Allies, or on contemporary America. He has plenty of accomplices, of course, in American academia.\n\nAfter a long line of native Counts, we find rule passing to Hainault, itself recently separated from Flanders. This leads to marriage to the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, whose inexhaustible heirs, however, are not enough to keep Holland and Hainault in their line.\n\nThe unfortunate Jacqueline, abandoning a marriage to the worthless, minor Duke of Brabant, lives to see both her realm and Brabant scooped up in the growing Burgundian empire, whence, of course, it soon passes to the Hapsburgs, later to emerge on the center stage of Europe in the great Revolt against Spain. Jacqueline's cause involved some years of fighting with Philip the Good (1419-1467) of Burgundy, after a dramatic escape from captivity in Ghent. This could count as one of the first Succession Wars, but it does not seem to be cited as one. With no heirs, despite four marriages, Jacqueline conceded the succession to Burgundy and retired.\n\nThe original list here has been corrected and expanded based on extensive research by my invaluable informant in the Netherlands, Jan van den Burg.

The drama and heroism of the revolt against Spain is too seldom recounted. A union of various states with their own traditions and governments, suspicious of authority, religiously tolerant, and the greatest commercial and banking power of the age, the Netherlands was one of the first truly modern states, even though its system of checks and balances was largely an artifact of mediaeval particularism, rather than a politically enlightened design. Although unable to withstand Napoleon and Hitler as successfully as Philip II or Louis XIV, these were all very fine enemies to have. Nor could a better exemplar and theorist of toleration be found in his age than Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677). At the same time, unforgettable images of peaceful, quiet, prosperous life, as in Jan Vermeer (1632-1775, commemorated in the 2003 movie, Girl With a Pearl Earring) and many others, were created in Dutch painting.\n\nThe declaration of Dutch independence was nearly simultaneous with the loss of Portuguese independence. The Dutch were then barely free of Spanish power before they were overseas taking Portuguese possessions away from them in India and the East Indies. For some time the Netherlands was then the predominant power in the Indian Ocean. Nagasaki is marked on the map even though this was not an actual Dutch possession; but for three centuries this was the only port, and the Dutch the only traders, through which Japan maintained contact with Europeans. Substantial Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good Hope (1652) created a colonial population, the Boers, who dominated the history of South Africa until quite recently. When the Cape Colony was kept by Britain at the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, the Boers soon decided to leave, heading inland on the Great Trek (1836), and founding the Boer Republics of the Transvaal (1852) and Orange Free State (1854). As at the Cape, Dutch power soon retreated before British and French. Nevertheless, the Dutch retained hold of Indonesia, which became one of the largest and most populous European colonial possessions anywhere. Nor did the Indonesians submit peacefully. Dutch rule was often harsh, and as late as 1908 the famous island of Bali was subjugated amid scenes of slaughter. The bitterness of the Indonesians translated into much collaboration with the occupying Japanese in World War II and resistance to the return of the Allies. Indonesian independence in 1949 was not the kind of often amiable parting that the British enjoyed in India. Unfortunately, the Dutch later (1963) allowed Indonesia to annex the western part of New Guinea, Irian, which otherwise had no historical, cultural, linguistic, or religious connection to it.\n\nIn the New World, the Dutch most famously founded New Amsterdam in 1625, later to become New York City -- all Dutch possessions were the \"New Netherlands.\" Dutch names are still to be found, of places and persons, from New York City up the Hudson Valley and in New Jersey. One of these names, Roosevelt (from Claes Martenzen van Rosenvelt/Roosevelt, who settled in New Amsterdam in 1644), became the name of two American Presidents. Another name, Vanderbilt (from Jan Aertszoon van der Bilt, 1620-1705, who arrived as an indentured servant in 1650), became the name of one of the wealthiest families in American history.\n\nIn 1667 the British compensated the Dutch for the loss of all of the New Netherlands by the cession of Dutch Guiana, or Surinam, which became independent only in 1975. Otherwise, the Netherlands Antilles or the Netherlands West Indies -- Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Martin -- remain Dutch until today.\n\nAs the Netherlands became the first modern state in terms of commerce and tolerance, Amsterdam became the center of European banking and finance. In this, it succeeded the cities of northern Italy. Amsterdam has had only two successors since the 17th century, London and New York. (In the 1980's it briefly looked like Tokyo might succeed New York, but then the Japanese bubble burst.) The original Italian center of banking is remembered in the name of Lombard Street in the banking district of London. New York certainly took over financial supremacy as the result of World War I. When London itself took over is a little less clear, but the task was certainly accomplished by the time of the War of the Spanish Succession. The Bank of England itself, founded in 1694, was a large part of that process. The supremacy of Amsterdam in its day contains a valuable lesson. Spain enjoyed a flood of silver from Mexico and Peru (which are still the world's largest producers of silver). Then, as for many people now, this would have been expected to give Spain irresistible economic power. The Spanish economy, however, could not absorb the money, and even while inflation raged, the Spanish government still hovered on the edge of bankruptcy. When Spain suspended payments on its debt in 1576, and the army in the Netherlands didn't get paid, a mutiny handed the Dutch some sorely needed breathing room. Meanwhile, the Dutch, who had no such sources of precious metals, nevertheless had the economy to absorb the money. The Spanish silver, despite a state of war, ended up in Dutch hands. This refutes the crude but common Cargo Cult view of economics, that \"natural resources\" themselves constitute wealth. The lesson is not only applicable now, but even to the ancient world: e.g. some historians seem to think that Athens was prosperous and powerful, not because of a brilliant commercial culture, but just because of the Laurion silver mines. All of these are of a piece with ancient prejudices against trade and money and modern follies along the same lines. The modern Netherlands has fallen for many of the same devices of welfare socialism as the rest of Europe, but it nevertheless ranks as one of the freest economies on Earth, tied for fourth place [according to The Economist] with the United States, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Estonia (the top three are Hong Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand). Consequently, the Netherlands avoids the stagnant growth and high unemployment of nearby France, Germany, and Belgium.\n\nMuch of the genealogy below is from The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806, by Jonathan I. Israel [The Oxford History of Early Modern Europe, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995, 1998, p.470].

The Volume I was needed for the connection to the Houses of Mecklenburg and Lippe. The Dutch Royal House continues to be regarded as the House of Orange despite the failure of the male line in no less than three successive generations.\n\nCeylon, Dutch Governors (1640-1796)\n\nCommanders & Governors of the Dutch Cape Colony (1652-1806)\n\nThe Boer Republics (1854-1902)\n\nThe House of Orange and Nassau\n\nLorraine Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nKings of Belgium\n\nKings of Belgium Revolt against the\n\nNetherlands, 1830 Leopold I of\n\nSaxe-Coburg1831-1865 Leopold II1865-1909 Albert I1909-1934 Occupation by Germany,\n\n1914-1918 Leopold III1934-1951;\n\nexile,\n\n1945-1950;\n\nd. 1983 Occupation by Germany,\n\n1940-1944 CharlesRegent,\n\n1944-1951 Baudouin1951-1993 Albert II1993-2013,\n\nabdicated Philippe2013\n\nThe modern identity of Belgium was forged in the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain. Spain was able to retain the South of the country, which was recovered for Catholicism. For over a century, Belgium was the \"Spanish Netherlands.\" Transferred to Austria in 1713, as part of the settlement of the War of the Spanish Succession, it was the \"Austrian Netherlands\" until overrun by Revolutionary France in 1794. Since Austria had never been thrilled with defending such a vulnerable outlier, Belgium was transferred to the Netherlands by the Congress of Vienna. Reunited for the first time in 300 years, the differences between the North and the South had become too great for there to be a happy marriage. In the revolutionary year of 1830, the South broke away. This was of some concern to the Great Powers, because of the strategic position of the country, so a treaty was drawn up by which all guaranteed the neutrality of the place that was now for the first time called \"Belgium,\" after the Celtic tribe (Belgae) and the Roman Province (Belgica) that had been in the area. A German prince, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, an uncle of Queen Victoria of England, married to a daughter of the new Bourgeois King of France, was brought in to create a monarchy, and, indeed, Belgium grew in its neutrality for the rest of the century.\n\nThe most interesting thing, indeed, about Belgian history in the era was the personal slave state that Leopold II created in the Congo (1884). This grew into such a scandal that anti-slavery societies finally forced Leopold to cede the colony to the Belgian government (1908). Even so, Belgian rule did little to prepare the Congo for independence, which came in 1960. Since then, the country has gone through sad cycles of civil war, dictators, massacres, and economic decline. Leopold is also supposed to have had a bad moment when Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany casually asked him at a banquet once if he would mind if the German Army passed through Belgium on its way to France. It was soon common knowledge that German war plans involved the violation of Belgian neutrality. The Germans, as it happened, were as good as the rumors. The Belgian Army, led by King Albert, was driven right out of the country, and German atrocities against the Belgians became the stuff of years of Allied War propaganda. The Belgian forts were expected to at least slow the Germans, after the Russians in Port Arthur had held out for months against the Japanese in 1905. Unfortunately, observers failed to realize that the siege guns of the Japanese had been sunk at sea. When new guns finally arrived at Port Arthur, the Japanese quickly pulverized Russian defenses. The Germans, with even larger guns, made short work of the Belgian forts. Twenty years later, the Germans did it again. This time King Leopold III decided to stay in the Occupied country, but he was then perceived as being so pro-German that he had to go into exile when the War was over.\n\nOne consequence of World War I had been a share of German Tanganyika: Rwanda and Burundi or, formerly, Ruanda-Urundi. The history of these countries since their independence (1962) has been a horrifying lesson in ethnic conflict, as the pastoral, tall, and aristocratic Tutsis (or Watutsi) have more than once been slaughtered by the agrarian (and shorter) Hutus.\n\nCuriously, it is now common to claim that the Tutsis and Hutus are not ethnically different and that the distinction was introduced by the Belgians. If Tutsis were any taller, it was because the Belgians picked out taller people to be \"Tutsis.\" On the other hand, this claim is not consistently maintained, since one otherwise hears that Tutsis and Hutus are indistinguishable. Now, not far north of Rwanda, in the southern Sudan, there actually are very tall pastoral people, so it never seemed strange to me that groups of such people might appear in the highlands or impose themselves on the locals. Or perhaps the claims about the Belgians are true. Nevertheless, it was common in European empires to obtain the cooperation of local minorities in imperial administration, but I have never heard of some ethnic division being created out of whole cloth. My suspicion is that the thesis about the Tutsis and Hutus, whether true or not, sounds too much of a piece with the urge to blame all post-colonial ethnic conflicts on the effects of colonialism. I think that the real story is more like that ethnic conflicts were stopped by the Europeans and simply started up again afterwards -- or that a minority, already disliked, became the target of revenge for imperial cooperation.\n\nRecently, the epic massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda (1994), recounted by the fine movie Hotel Rwanda [2004], ended with the Tutsis, despite their minority (and depleted) status, actually taking over the country, with many Hutus fleeing into exile (into miserable and anarchic camps in the Congo). If anything, this would seem to bespeak the kind of discipline and military prowess that an aristocratic minority might be expected to possess, regardless of what the Belgians thought or did about them.\n\nNow, for Belgium itself, after 55 years of peace and prosperity again, although burdened with the high unemployment of Euro-socialism (over 12%), the worst problem that the country seems to have is linguistic. The Romance/Germanic language boundary runs right through the place, with Germanic speakers on the north side and the Walloons (French speakers) on the south side. This involves many minor irritations and occasional conflicts that threaten to become more serious. Originally, Belgian authorities wanted only French as the written and cultural language of the country. Only in 1928 was French replaced as the language of education in Flanders itself. What replaced it has occasioned some confusion. In the past, the Germanic languages of Belgium have in general been called \"Flemish.\" This serves to distinguish the language of Belgium from that of the Netherlands, but it obscures the truth that the official language of Belgium is actually no less than standard Dutch. There are spoken dialects of Dutch in Belgium, which are West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantic, and Limburgian. So while \"Flemish\" may have a political meaning as all the forms of Dutch spoken in Belgium, the linguistic meaning applies only to certain spoken dialects of Dutch, which are found not only in Belgium, but also in places in France and the Netherlands.\n\nLorraine Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nGrand Dukes of Luxembourg\n\nGrand Dukes of Luxembourg William I of the Netherlands1815-1840 half of Duchy ceded to Belgium, 1830 William II of the Netherlands1840-1849 William III of the Netherlands1849-1890 Adolph of Nassau1890-1905 William Alexis1905-1912 Marie Adélaïde1912-1919,\n\nd. 1924 Occupation by Germany, 1914-1918 Charlotte1919-1964,\n\nexile, 1940-1945 Occupation by Germany, 1940-1945 Jean of Bourbon-Parma1964-2000,\n\nabdicated Henri2000-present\n\nLuxembourg is the last Grand Duchy in Europe -- though the type really only dates from the time of Napoleon. When the Salic Law prohibited the succession of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to Luxembourg in 1890, a distant relative in the House of Nassau was found for the Grand Duchy. This turned out to be Adolph, who had been the Duke and Prince of Nassau, Usingen, and Nassau-Weilburg and had lost his state to Prussia in 1866, after taking the side of Austria in the Six Weeks War. Since Adolph was really of the senior line of Nassau, this was actually rather nice, for the Netherlands, in effect, to find a position for him after the loss of his job to Prussia.\n\nBy 1912 the Salic Law somehow was set aside and the succession has been twice to Grand Duchesses. Charlotte succeeded her sister Marie Adélaïde, who abdicated after gaining a pro-German reputation in World War I, and married the heir, Felix, of the Bourbons of Parma. The subsequent genealogy can be examined there and below.\n\nDespite its small size, Luxembourg is one of the richest countries in the world (along with Monaco, Hong Kong, and oil Sheikdoms). In terms of per capita income, Luxembourg is actually the richest country in the world -- with 133% of the per capita income of the United States, as adjusted for \"purchasing power parity,\" according to The Economist [2003]. The \"Benelux\" area (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) is the most heavily industrialized part of Europe and the heart of the new European Union, whose headquarters is in Brussels.\n\nAlthough Luxembourg was traditionally part of Germany, even still in the German Confederation of 1815, the names of recent Grand Dukes and Duchesses usually seem to be given in French, and the name of the country is now really always seen in its French form (rather than German Luxemburg). However, the official language of Luxembourg is Letzeburgish or Luxembourgeois, alternative names that make it difficult to know whether it is a dialect of German or of French. It is actually a dialect of German, as we see in a local saying, Mir wölle bleiwe wat mir sin (\"We want to remain what we are\"). In standard (High) German that would be Wir wollen bleiben was wir sind -- wat rather than was reveals the affinity with Dutch wat and English \"what.\" We also see this in the Letzeburgish name of the country, the Grousherzogdem Lezebuurg, which we can contrast with German Großherzogtum Luxemburg and French Grand-Duché de Luxembourg. These characteristics make it look like Letzeburgish is a dialect of Low German. However, it is actually High German. Its differences with standard modern High German is due to its belonging to the \"Central\" or \"Middle\" dialectic area of High German, where we have a transition between the sounds of High German and the sounds of Low German.\n\nLorraine Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nCopyright (c) 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 Kelley L.

The identity of the County as that of Burgundy rather than of Besançon seems to have shifted under the great Count Otto William. It came to be called the \"Free County\" because Count Renald III refused to do homage for the territory to the Emperor Lothar II in 1127. After a ten year struggle the County achieved practical autonomy, although not long afterward it became a possession, through marriage, of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa himself. For many years the County was associated with the County of Mâcon, on the map below lying on the Saône River about halfway between Lyon and Autun.\n\nAssembling the story of the Free County has not been easy. The chronology was originally derived mainly from Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies, and the genealogy initially from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. Tompsett did not include all the Counts, or Countesses, listed by Gordon. This was very frustrating, especially when ordinary histories pay no attention whatsoever to the County. What Tompsett did have, however, was the descent of Count Otto William from Berengar II of Ivrea, the last King of Italy before the Germans (Otto I) arrived. And he did enable me to construct, through the Counts of Auxonne, the line of descent all the way from Berengar's father to Charles II of Spain, the last Count of Burgundy before it became a permanent part of France. (But Tompsett did have a major confusion, listing Otto William as his own great-grandson! Tompsett also lists John I and Hugh of Auxonne as Counts of Burgundy, which Gordon does not -- Hugh would have been, by marriage, but not John.)\n\nThe gap in Tompsett's genealogy, from Beatrice I to Otto IV, was then helpfully supplied by a correspondent, Anthony Pick, on the basis of a 1957 Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on the history of Burgundy by J.B. Richard of the University of Dijon. I have been now able to confirm this in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997], where Otto I of Burgundy is shown (p.22) as a son of Frederick Barbarossa -- something I have really not seen elsewhere. Otto's daughter Beatrice is shown there married to Otto (II) of Meran, who is also given later (p.156) with their children Otto (III) and Adelaide (Adelheid) and Adelaide's marriage to Hugh of Auxonne. In the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 2001], Thiele also supplies information on the line of Renald II, which Tompsett left unaccounted for.\n\nI had nothing on the genealogy of the Counts before Otto William. However, a correspondent in Finland, Jouni Pöyliö, then pointed out that with the early Counts listed, the names and dates appeared to correspond to the first four Dukes of Burgundy. I didn't notice any mention of the County in Thiele's entries for the Dukes, and this still left other Counts unaccounted for. Mr. Pöyliö has now happily brought to my attention a French site, the Portail Histoire de la Bourgogne et de la Franche-Comté, that gives a complete list, with genealogical information, of the Counts of Burgundy, the Counts of Mâcon, and of other domains in the area (including the Dukes of Burgundy). This is a great reference for all this material, and much of the treatment here is now revised on the basis of its information.\n\nOf great interest in this genealogy are the marriages with the Emperor Frederick I and with Urraca, the Queen of León and Castile. These mean that the subsequent Hohenstaufen are descendants of Burgundy, while the House of León and Castile actually becomes that of Burgundy, or of Ivrea, if one does back far enough.\n\nIn the descent shown, the turning point is the marriage of Jeanne I to King Philip V of France. This is at the end of the House of Capet, but Jeanne and Philip actually have a number of daughters, through whom the County of Burgundy passes; and since they marry Dukes of Burgundy and Counts of Flanders, the fateful combination of the Duchy of Burgundy with the Counties of Flanders and Burgundy arises. In the following genealogy, we see the whole lot pass to the Dukes of Burgundy and then to the Hapsburg Kings of Spain. France tried to snatch the Free County at the death of Charles the Bold (1477), but it was not a fief of France. In 1482 the occupation was given legality as part of the dowry of Margaret of Austria in her engagement to the future Charles VIII of France. When Charles broke the engagement, however, in 1493, the territory was returned to the Hapsburgs -- something Charles VIII perhaps could have avoided doing and for which he is sometimes condemned (prudentially, if not morally). Note how the line of John I de Châlon, Lord of Arlay, becomes Princes of Orange, 1393-1530, before the succession of the much more famous Counts of Nassau.\n\nJeanne II1329-1347 Philip I1347-1361 Duke of\n\nBurgundy,\n\n1349-1361 Margaret I1361-1382 Louis, II\n\nof Flanders1382-1384 Count of\n\nFlanders,\n\n1346-1361 Margaret II1384-1405 Countess of\n\nFlanders,\n\n1384-1405 Philip II the Bold1384-1404 Duke of\n\nBurgundy,\n\n1364-1504 John the Fearless1404-1419 Duke of\n\nBurgundy,\n\n1404-1419 Philip III\n\nthe Good1419-1467 Duke of\n\nBurgundy,\n\n1419-1467 Charles I\n\nthe Bold1467-1477 Duke of\n\nBurgundy,\n\n1467-1477 Mary1477-1482 occupied by France,\n\n1477-1493 Philip II\n\nthe Handsome\n\nI of Spain1482-1506 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1504-1506 Charles II,\n\nI of Spain,\n\nV of Empire1506-1556,\n\nd.1558 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1516-1556 Emperor,\n\n1519-\n\n1556 Philip V,\n\nII of Spain1556-1598 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1556-1598 Philip VI,\n\nIII of Spain1598-1621 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1598-1521 Philip VII,\n\nIV of Spain1621-1665 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1621-1665 Charles III,\n\nII of Spain1665-1678,\n\nd.1700 King of\n\nSpain,\n\n1665-1700 to France, 1678\n\nIt is noteworthy that Margaret of Mâle stood to become Countess of Burgundy through the prospective marriage with her cousin, Philip of Rouvre, the last Capetian Duke of Burgundy. Philip, however, died of the plague, and the County actually passed to Margaret's grandmother. The deaths of her grandmother and father then brought her the County anyway, which then passed to the Dukes of Burgundy after all, since Margaret married the new Valois Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold.\n\nThe Free County of Burgundy was an important stepping stone for Spain from the Mediterranean to the Spanish Netherlands, as for the infamous March of the Duke of Alba to put down unrest in the Netherlands in 1567. Eventually, however, Spanish power was broken, and the Wars of Louis XIV targeted all the lands to the east of France. His Dutch War (1672-1678), which failed in the conquest of the Netherlands, nevertheless netted the Free County. The union with France of a French speaking region seemed so complete and natural that, unlike Alsace or Lorraine, it has really never been challenged. Most residents and travellers are probably unaware that it was never a historic or legal part of France until 1678.\n\nBurgundia Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 Kelley L.

Where the Kingdom went to the German Emperor, Conrad II, Neuchâtel went to Ulrich, Count of Fenis. In 1406, the domain became associated with the Swiss Confederation. When Neuchâtel formally joined the Swiss state in 1814, it was the only monarchy to become a Swiss Canton. And the monarch at the time was, extraordinarily, King Frederick William III (1797-1840) of Prussia. The full size of the present domain was reached in 1373.\n\nDeutsch-Neuenburg Ulrich III1191-1225 Deutsch-Neuenburg-Aarberg Ulrich IV1225-1276 Wilhelm1276-1323/4 Deutsch-Neuenburg-Nidau Rudolf I1225-1258 Rudolf II1258-1308/9 Rudolf III1308/9-1339 Rudolf IV1339-1375 Deutsch-Neuenburg-\n\nStrassberg Berthold I1225-1270, d.1273 Berthold II1270-1282/93 Otto I1270-1275 Otto II1282/92-1318 Berthold III1282/92-1320 Imer1318-1364 Welsch-Neuenburg Rudolf II1191-1196 Berthold1196-1260 Rudolf III1203-1263/4 Rudolph IV?1259-1263 Ulrich IV1263/4-1277 Amadeus1270-1287/8 Rudolf (Rollin)1282-1343 Louis/Ludwig I of Welsch-Neuenburg1343-1373 Domain Reunited, 1343\n\nNeuchâtel straddles the Jura Mountains, bounded on the east by Lake Neuchâtel and on the west by the Franche Comté, now France. It is entirely French speaking, but in the dialect now recognized as Franco-Provençal -- where the name is Nôchâtél. A previous desire to identify with Parisian French now seems to have given way to a desire to preserve the local linguistic heritage. This being Switzerland, Neuchâtel in Italian would be Neocastello, and in Rhomansch Neuchâtel or Neufchâtel. As we see, the \"â\" in French (etc.) often indicates the loss of an \"s,\" obviously from Latin castellum. The English equivalent of the name here would just be the familiar \"Newcastle.\"\n\nThe division of the domain in 1191 resulted in two lines interestingly identified as Welsch- Neuenburg and Deutsch- Neuenburg, i.e. \"French Neuchâtel\" and \"German Neuchâtel.\" Since Neuchâtel is now entirely French speaking, one wonders where the \"German\" domain was located, or if the linguistic boundary has shifted. The German speaking Bern Canton does border on Lake Neuchâtel and on the eastern end of Neuchâtel. For the use of \"Welsch\" for \"French,\" see the discussion of this interesting word here.\n\nWith the failure of male heirs, the line of princes experienced shifts to different houses. For everything that was going on, especially in the divisions beginning in 1191, genealogies are needed, which I find difficult to assemble. Neuchâtel does not loom large as a part of either German or French history and thus, like Burgundy as a whole, tends to fall between the stools of national histories. In Swiss history, there is of course the anomaly that the domain was not republican from the first. Thus, so far I have been able to trace the genealogy for the Freiburg and Zähringen Princes and for the interesting illegitimate line of the French House of Orléans.\n\nThe period of the Zähringen Princes derives from the marriage of the Freiburg heiress, Anna, to Rudolf III of Hachburg (etc.). We also see Anna's father, Egino IV, marrying the Fenis heiress of Neuchâtel, by which the house of Freiburg came into the succesion. Anna's brother, Conrad IV (1384-1424), and nephew, John (1424-1457), then succeed to Neuchâtel. The numbering of some of these people varies between the sources. When John dies, the succession jumps down two generations to Rudolf IV. The same thing happens with the heiress Jeanne de Rothelin (1504-1512, 1529-1543), whose tenure was interrupted by the Swiss Confederation mediating the succession dispute. With Jeanne's death, the succession jumped to her nephew-in-law, Francis of Orléans.\n\nLouis d'Orléans devoilant\n\nune maitresse, \"Louis of Orléans reveals a mistress,\" 1826,\n\nEugène Delacroix\n\nThe line of Orléans-Longueville all begins with a marvelous bit of scandal immortalized by Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863). The husband of Mariette d'Enghien, the mistress of Duke Louis of Orléans, suspects his wife and the Duke of an affair. The Duke invites the husband into his bedroom and exposes his mistress in bed. However, he raises the sheets so as to conceal her face and expose only her body. Surely t"
