        "text": "John the Fearless (sans Peur) (1404-1419)\n\nJohn the Fearless, also called John II or Jan zonder Vrees was Duke of Burgundy from 1404 to 1419. He fought against the Turks at Nicopolis in 1396 where he distinguished himself on the battlefield and earned his nickname 'the Fearless'.\n\nHe was a member of the Valois Dynasty and Regent for his cousin Charles VI of France who was mentally ill. There was a power struggle with the King's younger brother Louis of Orléans to gain guardianship and control over the Dauphin. This struggle culminated to the brutal assassination of Louis in the streets of Paris in 1407.\n\nOn 10 September 1419 John had a meeting with the Dauphin (the future Charles VII of France) to discuss a peace treaty. The meeting rook place on the bridge at Montereau where John was assassinated by the Dauphin's companions.\n\nJohn the Fearless introduced two silver coins during his reign: the 'cromstaert' and the 'braspenning'. He maintained the coat of arms from his father Pilip the Bold, but added an inescutcheon: the arms of Flanders (small lion).\n\nPhilip the Good (1419-1467)\n\nPhilip the Good also known as Philippe le Bon or Philips de Goede became Duke of Burgundy after the assassination of his father John the Fearless (Jan zonder Vrees) in 1419. He was one of the most powerful and influential rulers of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn 1430 he created the Order of the Golden Fleece. For the order he chose his personal emblem, the fire-steel in the shape of “B” for Burgundy, placed two of them back to back and suspended the fleece from a flint stone positioned between the fire-steels. This emblem of the Golden Fleece and the Collar of the Golden Fleece has been used on many coins since then, it is a very popular design on Spanish coinage.\n\nDuring his reign Philip tried to achieve a geographical unit and greatly expanded his territories by acquiring Namur, Brabant, Limburg, Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland and Luxemburg. To promote commerce and the economic development of his territories Philip the Good introduced a new and stable currency which he issued in 1434 for Flanders, Brabant, Holland and Hainaut (1st emission - Coinage Act, January 23rd 1433). The new system was based on the groat of Flanders and included the following coins:\n\n- Gold coins: Goudrijder (Gold Rider or Cavalier d'or) and ½ Cavalier d'or\n\n- Silver coins: Vierlander (double groat or patard), ½ vierlander (groat), ¼ vierlander (½ groat) and 1/8 vierlander (¼ groat)\n\n- Billon coins: double mite and mite.\n\nThe name of the new silver coin 'Vierlander' refers to the four countries where they were struck.\n\nWith the 2nd Emission (Coinage Act - June 11th 1454) Philip introduced a new type gold coin: the gold lion.\n\nThe 3rd Emission (Coinage Act - May 23rd 1466) a uniform manufacture of the Burgundian guilder was ordered. In 1496 it was replaced with the St. Philippus guilder.\n\nView a Vierlander, struck in Gent or Brugge under Philip the Good under NumisAntica - Medieval coins\n\nPhilip the Handsome or the Fair (1478-1506)\n\nPhilip the Handsome or Philips de Schone was the first Habsburg King of Castile. The list of his regnal titles also included (among others) Count of Flanders and Holland, Duke of Burgundy and Brabant. He was the son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Mary of Burgundy. In 1496 he married Infanta Joanna of Castile.\n\nHe introduced 2 new gold coins: the \"St. Philippus goudgulden\" with a value of 24 stuivers and in 1496 the \"Gouden vlies\" or \"toison d’or\" which had a value of 50 stuivers.\n\nPhilip IV (1285-1314)\n\nA member of the House of Capet, Philip was the son of King Philip III and Isabella of Aragon. He ascended the throne at age 17.\n\nIn 1294 hostilities broke out between the French King and his brother-in-law, Edward I, King of England. He also suffered a major military defeat in Flanders. For the first time in recorded history an army of footsoldiers (Flemish) defeated an army of knights (French army) in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (Goudensporenslag) near Kortrijk on 11 July 1302. The large numbers of golden spurs that were collected from the French knights gave the battle its name. The date of the battle is still the official holiday of the Flemish community in Belgium.\n\nDuring his reign Philip had to search for income to cover these military expenditures and finance his royal budget. He levied heavy taxes on the French clergy, expelled the Jews from France, aniihilated the order of the Knights Templar and debased the coinage. His grandfather had minted a few gold coins (Ecu), but under Philip there was a mass diffusion of gold coinage. Hence his nickname le roi \"faux monnayeur\", meaning \"King counterfeiter\".\n\nCharles VI (3 December 1368 – 21 October 1422), called the Beloved (le Bien-Aimé) and the Mad (le Fou). In 1380 he came to the throne as a member of the House of Valois.\n\nCharles experienced mental ilness in 1392 which plagued him throughout his life. This resulted in major feuds as his uncles (the Duke of Burgundy and the Duke du Berry) and his brother (Louis, Duke of Orleans) struggled for power; and seriously weakened the French position during the Hundred Years' War. Charles VI (as did more French kings) found alternative ways to finance the war: sales taxes and debasing the coinage.\n\nAfter the death of Charles VI in 1422 both his son (Charles VII) and his grandson (Henry VI of England) were proclaimed King of France. Charles VI appears to have passed on his mental illness to his grandson Henry, whose inability to govern led England to another civil war, known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nJoan (Johanna or Jeanne) and Margaret of Constantinople were the daughters of Count Baldwin IX of Flanders (also Count Baldwin VI of Hainaut) and of Marie of Champagne. He was one of the most prominent leaders of the Fourth Crusade which resulted in the capture of Constantinople and the foundation of the Latin Empire. He was crowned as the First Emperor of the Latin Empire in Constantinople on 16th of May 1204. After he vanished in 1205, his daughter Joan succeeded as Countess of Hainaut and Flanders. Apart from two known coins (denarius and obole), struck under Reginar V (1013-1030), medieval minting in Hainaut commenced under the rule of Countess Joan.\n\nAfter the death of Countess Joan, her sister Margaret succeeded her as Margaret II, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut (1244-1280). She remained Countess of Flanders until 1278 and Countess of Hainaut until her death in 1280.\n\nTo facilitate trade, around 1270 Marguerite of Constantinople ordered her mints to issue imitations of the \"gros tournois,\" the heavy silver coin that King Louis IX of France had first issued in 1266. The original portrait on the obverse of the gros tournois was retained, but the reverse was replaced by an armored rider (ridder). Hereby the first introduction of a rider was made in Western European coinage."
