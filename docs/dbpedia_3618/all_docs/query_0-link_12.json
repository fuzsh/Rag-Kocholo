        "text": "The National Convention had ordered that all signs of feudalism, such as noble and royal tombs, be destroyed. We may deplore this attitude even if we might partially understand it, but it is difficult to wholly condemn it as, even in the West, this attitude continues when we destroy reminders of the past - often a recent past, at that - which we now find unacceptable or wish to forget. One example of many is the removal of the statues of Robert E. Lee, hardly a down and out villain, in the Southern States of America. It must be remembered that many of those condemned by the National Convention were just titles holders and nothing more, while others were downright nasty pieces of work, such as Philip the Fair.\n\nOn 31st July 1793 Bertrand BarÃ¨re speaking before the National Convention suggested attacking the 'unclean ashes' of the 'tyrants', under the pretext of recovering the lead from their coffins, to celebrate the first anniversary of the storming of the Tuileries. The next day it was decided that the tombs of the former kings in St Denis and elsewhere were to be destroyed. So on August 10th the monuments of the Merovingian and Carolingian kings were demolished. The remains were mostly crumbling into dust.\n\nThen on October 12th the monument of Marshal Turenne was smashed and his coffin was removed from the small crypt below his monument. Turenne's body - he was France's greatest general before Napoleon - was not thrown into one of the pits but displayed in the church for eight months so people could pay their respects to the great man. He was later reburied in Lenoir's Elysian Gardens in his Museum of Sculpture, where his reassembled monument was now housed. This was not the end of the Marshall's post-mortem adventures: in 1800 Napoleon transferred his body and the monument to Les Invalides in Paris, where it may still be seen. Lenoir executed a drawing of the Marshal's body (Left); however this is clearly idealized as he had been killed by a cannon ball shot to his abdomen in battle!\n\nNext the gang broke into the Bourbon vault through a hole in the wall and opened the coffin of Henry IV. His body was in an excellent state of preservation and a cast of his face to make a death mask was taken. His body in its coffin was displayed in the crypt for a weekend and then in the choir. However, although Henry was the most popular of kings his body did not fare as well as that of Turenne's: it was cast into the pit with the others. However his head may have been removed as a mummified head, said to be that of the King, exists; DNA testing appears to be inconclusive so we must conclude that this identification is non-proved. It must be added that if it were removed then this was to collect a rather grizzly souvenir not out of disrespect as that shown to Cromwell and the others at the Restoration.\n\nHenry IV Painting from Life Henry IV Death Mask Drawing of Henry's Exhumed Body Mummified Head said to be that of Henry IV\n\nTwo days later opening of the coffins, ejecting the remains and recovering the lead continued, the crowd often collecting body parts as grisly souvenirs; for example Camile Desmoulins took Turenne's little finger and a soldier a lock of hair. Other souvenirs included Dagobert's skull, Henry III's teeth, Philip Augustus's hair and a leg of Catherine of MÃ©dici; or so it is reported. On the 16th more coffins were opened and some workers complained of feeling unwell because of the foul smelling black vapour that was emitted. There are reports of the condition of the bodies: Henry IV's body, as mentioned above, was in an excellent state of preservation, Marie of MÃ©dici's consisted of bones floating in muddy water, Anne of Austria was in an advanced state of putrefaction, Louis XIII could only be identified by his black moustache, while Louis XIV was recognizable but had turned black.\n\nTwo pits were dug in the monks' cemetery: one for the Valois and 'First Races' (earlier dynasties) and another for the Bourbons. In all 170 bodies were removed and thrown into the two pits and then covered in quick lime (calcium oxide).\n\nThe exhumations were witnessed by a crowd which included officials, former monks and others, among whom was artist-archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir who helped to save the monuments, reassembling them for his Museum of Sculpture, although he justified with Biblical quotation the exhumations.\n\nAfter the temporary restoration of the monarchy, Louis XVII recovered the bodies of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette from the Madeleine Cemetery, along with other victims of the guillotine. They had been buried in open coffins to accelerate decomposition. However there were eyewitnesses to the burials, including a judge and the actual grave digger, as well as the fact that the owner of the land - a royalist - had cared for the graves and planted a weeping willow over them. The excavators reached lime when they had dug twelve feet, the depth of the initial burial, and found wood, bones and a garter so that these were recognized as the remains of the Queen. There was nothing to identify the King although bones and wood were found although in a worse state of putrefaction than the Queen; nevertheless these were supposed to be the remains of the King.\n\nThe bodies discussed above were reburied in ten coffins in an ossuary behind two marble plates on either side of a short narrow corridor. Having been in their graves for years, then ejected, thrown in the earth and covered with quick lime, their condition must have been extremely bad and unrecognizable. The black marble plates, each photographed in three sections because of the narrowness of the corridor, are shown below; and below these I have attempted to copy out the text carved on them.\n\nDagobert I\n\nCharles II 'The Bald'\n\nPhilip II 'Augustus'\n\nLouis VIII\n\nPhilip IV 'Le Bel'\n\nLouis X 'Le Huntin'\n\nJohn I\n\nPhilip V 'The Long'\n\nCharles IV 'Le Bel'\n\nPhilip VI 'Of Valois'\n\nJean II 'The Good'\n\nCharles VII\n\nLouis XII 'Father of the People'\n\nHenry II\n\nFrancis II\n\nCharles IV\n\nHenry III\n\nNantilde, 2nd wife of Dagobert\n\nMarguerite of Provence, wife of St Louis\n\nJeanne of Burgundy, wife of Philip VI\n\nJeanne of France, Queen of Navarre and daughter of Louis X\n\nJean of Evreux, wife of Charles IV\n\nBlanche of Navarre, 2nd wife of Philip VI\n\nAnne of Brittany, wife of Louis XII\n\nClaude of France, wife of Francis II\n\nCatherine of Medici, wife of Henry II\n\nMarguerite of Valois, 1st wife of Henry IV\n\nHugh, Duke of France & Burgundy, Count of Paris & OrlÃ©ans, father of Hugh Capet.\n\nSuger, Abbot of St Denis\n\nAdam Troon, Abbot of St Denis\n\nPierre d'_, Abbot of St Denis\n\nPierre de _ , Chamberlaine of St Louis\n\nMathieu de _, Abbot of St Denis\n\nSÃ©dille St Croix, Counsellor of Charles VI\n\nBetrand du Guesclin, Constable of France\n\nBureau de la RiviÃ¨re, Chamberlaine of Charles V & Charles VI\n\nLouis de Sancerre, Constable of France\n\nArnaud Guillem de Barbazan, Chamberlaine of Charles VII\n\nNa\n\nPhilip surnamed Dagobert, son of Louis VIII\n\nBlanche, daughter of St Louis\n\nJean, son of St Louis\n\nLouis of France,son of St Louis\n\nJean called Tristan of Damiette, son of St Louis\n\nLouis & Philip, two sons of St Louis\n\nCharles V 'The Wise'\n\nCharles VI 'The Mad'\n\nCharles VII 'The Victorious'\n\nHenry IV 'The Great'\n\nLouis XIII 'The Just'\n\nLouis XV 'The Beloved'\n\nN. of France, Duke of Orleans, 2nd son of Henry IV\n\nMarie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpendier, 1st wife of Gaston Jean Baptiste d'OrlÃ©and, son of Henry IV\n\nJesn Gaston d'OrlÃ©ans, Duke of Valois, son of Henry IV\n\nMarie Anne d'OrlÃ©ans, daughter of Gaston Jean Baptiste, Duke of son of Henry IV\n\nGaston Jean Baptiste of France, Duke of OrlÃ©ans, son of Henry IV\n\nAnne Elisabeth of France, Elder daughter of Louis XIV\n\nMarieanne of France, 2nd daughter of Louis XIV\n\nN. of OrlÃ©ans, Daughter of Philip of France, Duke of Burgundy, Monsieur, brother of Louis XIV\n\nPhilip Charles of OrlÃ©ans, Duke of Valois, son of Philip of France, Duke of OrlÃ©ans, brother of Louis XIV\n\nHenriette Marie of France, daughter of Henry IV, wife of Charles I of England\n\nHenriette Anne Stuart, 1st wife of Phillip of France, Duke of OrlÃ©ans, brother of Louis XIV\n\nPhilip of France, Duke of Anjou, 2nd son of Louis XIV\n\nMarguerite of Lorraine, Duchess of OrlÃ©ans, 2nd wife of Gaston Jean Baptiste, Duke of Orleans, son of Henry IV\n\nLouis Francis of France, Duke of Anjou, 3rd son of Louis XIV\n\nMarie ThÃ©rÃ¨se of France, 3rd daughter of Louis XIV\n\nAlexander Louis of OrlÃ©ans, Duke of Valois, son of Philip of France, Duke of Orleans, Monsieur, brother of Louis XIV\n\nMarie Anne Christine Victoire of Bavaria, wife of Louis Dauphin, son of Louis XIV\n\nAnee Marie Louise of OrlÃ©ans, Duchess of Monpensier, Mademoiselle, daughter of Gaston Jean Baptiste, Duke of OrlÃ©ans, son of Henry IV\n\nPhilip of France, Duke of OrlÃ©ans, Monsieur, brother of Louis XIV\n\nN.
