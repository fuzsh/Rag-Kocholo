        "text": "A place of rest and relaxation for princes, emperors and presidents\n\nLocated in the Yvelines, just outside Paris, and on the edge of one of the prettiest forests in Île-de-France, the Château de Rambouillet has long been occupied by those in power as a place to enjoy some down time, far from the courts and ministries in Paris. The castle is spacious but not overly huge, and comfortable. Its vast park and gardens allow for leisurely strolls and the forests are a favourite hunting ground for many kings.\n\nFrançois Ier loved to hunt in the Rambouillet forest – he actually died in the castle following an accident. Louis XIV bought the castle in 1704 for his legitimate son, the Count of Toulouse, who made the castle his permanent home and enjoyed a peaceful family life. His son, the Duke of Penthièvre, continued to love the château and ordered the installation of an English garden in which the ornamental Chaumière aux Coquillage (the ‘shelfish thatched cottage’) was built and remains today.\n\nLouis XVI turned his gaze towards the château and purchased it for a whopping 16 million French pounds. He wanted an escape from the pressures of the court in Paris and enjoyed hunting but his wife, Marie-Antoinette hated Rambouillet – more on this later.\n\nNapoléon I took possession of the castle in 1804 though it was severely damaged by the Revolution. Still, he restored it and remodelled it, blasting one wing away with dynamite, reshaping the façade and planting thousands of trees. He came regularly to the castle to relax and his apartments have just recently been reopened to the public following extensive renovations. After a period of neglect, Napoleon III saved the castle by restoring it and giving it to his cousin.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the French monarchs, President Felix Faure decided to make Rambouillet the summer home of French presidents and he took over the castle in 1895. The property also played host to diplomatic receptions and summits and has seen many a head of state strolling the grounds, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to John F. Kennedy, to Queen Elizabeth II. In 1975, president Giscard d’Estaing hosted the first G6 summit at Rambouillet.\n\nIn fact, the castle was still occupied by French heads of State until recently. It entered the casre of the Centre des Monuments Nationaux in 2009 and its halls, corridors, stately rooms and gardens have gradually been opened to the public ever since."
