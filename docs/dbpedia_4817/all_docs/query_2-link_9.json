        "text": "What a buzz! üêù In honor of celebrating the 125th anniversary of Bosch in the #UK, a group of associates at Bosch Power Tools in #Stowmarket volunteered for a wonderful cause. During their working hours, they volunteered for a charity program named ActivLives and revitalized local bee gardens for the community in Suffolk. Wanting to give back to their local community it came natural to the gardening division at Bosch to volunteer for an outdoor project, where our power tools could make a positive impact. The associates had the chance to witness the products in action and at the same time put their skills and knowledge of lawn and garden tools to the test. By dedicating more than 300 working hours all together, the initiative did not only contribute to the local community and sustainability, but also strengthened the team spirit. The participants had great fun exchanging their office desks for time outside in nature, which also allowed them to connect with colleagues they may not typically interact with on a daily basis. A true win-win situation for everyone! Congratulations to the busy bees in Suffolk. üí™ It's inspiring to witness how sustainability and team spirit are being driven at Bosch Power Tools. üêùüåº #PowerTools #LawnAndGarden #Sustainability #Beegarden #Volunteering #Charity"
