        "text": "Creating a growth market\n\nGraham’s fascination with business started in an unlikely place: on his parents’ farm in South Africa. Growing up on the farm, he was always interested in the business side of things – the numbers, the analysis, and what made it successful.\n\nGraham went to London to actively seek out a role in the transactions space and joined the EY team in 2004. He returned to Africa in 2010 at a time when private equity was booming amid an exciting ‘rising Africa’ narrative.\n\n“PE is growing businesses faster than the listed environment,” says Graham, “growing them in the medium-sized market where access to capital is more constrained, particularly in the developing world and the rest of Africa.”\n\n“In bringing more capital into Africa and driving high growth businesses - that keeps me satisfied. You know you’re making a difference, that’s what has kept me going,” he said.\n\n“From a PE perspective, the pace of change has increased rapidly and that’s where Ansarada is providing the technology – the platform – to enable advisors to really get into the detail of what’s going on, what does this mean, what are the insights.”\n\n“Companies selling their businesses are suddenly surprised at the questions being asked by buyers,” says Graham. “Because the level of information needs a level of sophistication that is being demanded – that is available – people are really getting into a lot of detailed insights. It’s challenging the future rationale, the future plans for the business they plan to buy.”"
