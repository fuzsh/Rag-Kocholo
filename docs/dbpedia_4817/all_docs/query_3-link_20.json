        "text": "Dear SAVCA Members and Friends,\n\nRealising value through successful exits\n\nA number of factors point towards an uptick in exit activity in coming quarters: public markets are at a high, the range of exit avenues are broadening and a number of funds are nearing the end of their terms. With this in mind, in this week’s newsletter we look at exits from a number of industry perspectives. We bring you the second in a series of videos titled SAVCA-EY Excellence in Exits which explores exit experiences across the region. We also talk to Graham Stokoe, Executive Director and Africa Private Equity Leader at Ernst & Young about the major themes driving exit activity across the continent.\n\nThe exit process will also come under the spotlight at the upcoming SAVCA LP Breakfast to be held at The Saxon Hotel on the 21st October 2014. The breakfast, which is exclusive to representatives from limited partners and fund of funds, will cover exit trends and options and key success factors.\n\nWe’re also covering the other end of the private equity deal spectrum: The upcoming SAVCA GIBS Advanced Programme in Private Equity on 8 of October 2014 will tackle every aspect of successful deal completion – from due diligence and negotiation, to structuring, approvals and sign-off. The speaker line-up is impressive: We have secured Ron den Besten from The Abraaj Group and Stuart Bradley from Phatisa as keynote presenters. Joining them will be Richard Fienberg and Shaun Zagnoev from Ethos Private Equity, Alex-Handrah Aimé from ECP, Jayendra Naidoo from the J&J Group and Peter McCrystal and Craig Miller from PwC. Please secure your place soonest.\n\nLooking forward to 2015, the SAVCA team is keeping busy with the preparations for next year’s SAVCA Private Equity Industry Conference to be once again held at Spier in Stellenbosch. The conference is scheduled for 13 February 2015. With the tagline Investing for Growth, Investing for Good, the conference will showcase how private equity funding gives investors exposure to African growth while also developing the economies on our continent. We will soon communicate more regarding the conference line-up as well as enticing early-bird specials.\n\nFinally, have a look at some of the photos from the recent SAVCA Venture Capital (VC) Foundation Course.\n\nPlease keep us updated with your news and visit the SAVCA website to find new research, industry updates and upcoming events.\n\nRegards\n\nErika van der Merwe\n\nCEO: SAVCA\n\nResearch\n\nInsights on exits\n\nThis week we bring you the second in the SAVCA-EY Excellence in Exits Video Series illustrating private equity exit experiences in Southern Africa. This video features an interview with Clive Howell, Head of Private Equity at Nedbank Capital.
