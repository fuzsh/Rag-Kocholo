        "text": "Hebrew Law denies Deaf Rights\n\nTorah protects the deaf from being cursed by others, but does not allow them to participate in the rituals of the temple. Special laws concerning marriage and property were established for deaf-mutes, but deaf-mutes were not allowed to be witnesses in courts.\n\nPhilosophy of Innate Intelligent/Plato\n\nPlato divided humans up based on their innate intelligence, strength, and courage and those who are not overly bright, strong, or brave are suited to various productive professions: farming, smithing, building, etc. The philosophy of innate intelligence is that it is inherent within us. This intelligence is expressed in our bodies via our nervous system.\n\nAncient Greeks Deny Deaf Education/Aristotle\n\nAristotle said that \"those who were born deaf all become senseless and incapable of reason\" and that \"the blind were more intelligent than the deaf\".\n\nDark and Middle Ages - Middle Ages\n\nPeople that were born deaf could not have faith and could not be saved and were barred from churches. It was necessary that they \"hear\" the word of God and being deaf was punishment from God.\n\nMartha's Vineyard\n\nMartha's Vineyard was settled on by 200 immigrants from Kent County England, also known as \"the Weald\". All of the immigrants carried dominant and recessive genes for deafness. By the 1700's, a sign language for the deaf and hearing had developed on the island, but it was not ASL. The birth rate of deaf children on the island was 1 in 155 and the average is 1 in 1000. The island deaf children went to Hartford to be educated when the American School for the Deaf was established in 1817.\n\nOral Education/Samuel Heinicke\n\nSamual Heinicke was a German oral teacher of the deaf who started the first oral school for the deaf in the world in Germany. He was the originator of systematic education for the deaf and was born in Nautshutz, Germany. He taught people speech by having them feel his throat while he spoke. His method was termed \"the German Method\".\n\nGermany - Arnoldi\n\nGerman pastor, Arnoldi, believed that education of the deaf should begin as early as four years old.\n\n\"Golden Age of Deaf Education\"\n\nAmerican Sign Language flourished. Approximately 40% of all teachers were deaf.\n\nA Deaf State is Proposed - John Flournoy\n\nJohn Flournoy was a former person of the Connecticut school. He proposed to congress that there should be a Deaf state with land set aside in the western territories for the creation of a Deaf state. The Deaf could control their schools and establish their own government in this state. For the Deaf community to flourish more, it would be unrestrained by prejudice and the often restrictive good intentions of the hearing society.\n\nGallaudet College Opens\n\nAbraham Lincoln: He signed the charter for the Washington, D.C. based college for the deaf to be created.\n\nNational College for the Deaf and Dumb: this was the only accredited facility for the deaf in the United States to offer college degrees.\n\nEdward Miner Gallaudet: This was the son of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and the first president of Gallaudet. The dedication of the Gallaudet family is honored when the college changes its name to Gallaudet College in 1893.\n\nBell's Deaf School\n\nAlexander Graham Bell opened a school in Boston, MA that concentrates on oral methods of instruction. The shool received heavy opposition from deaf school using manual sign language. Bell eventually gave up administering deaf education and focused on a contraption that mechanized speech. In 1876 he then invented the telephone and was highly recognized. because of his recognition, he went on the found the Volta Bureau to promote oral-based deaf education for deaf children.\n\nHelen Keller\n\nHelen Keller was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama and lost both her sight and hearing at 19 months old. She was taught ways to communicate at home by her friend and teacher, Annie Sullivan, and later at the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston, Mass. She later graduated from Radcliffe College with her Bachelor of Arts degree and was the first deaf-blind person to do so. She was an American author, political activist, and lecturer.\n\nThe Conference of Milan Endorses Oral Education\n\nThis was an international gathering of deaf educators in a move with repercussions well into the future pronouncing all oral education methods superior to manual communication systems. The only country that opposed the vote for oral-based education was the United States, where manual education had been successful. Over the next 10 years, the population of manual education for the deaf declined sharply. In the U.S., the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) was founded and gained support.\n\nDeaf Players make changes in Baseball and Football\n\nWilliam \"Dummy\" Hoy was a deaf baseball player who gave American Lague its first grand slam in 1901. The umpire hand signals were developed so that Hoy could see a strike from the outfield when he was playing. In the 1920's, Gallaudet University's football team kept its plays a secret by hiding signed instructions in a huddle formation. Other teams quickly followed the huddling, creating a football tradition.\n\nWomen are admitted to the National Deaf-Mute College\n\nIn 1887, women are starting to be admitted to the National Deaf-Mute College (now Gallaudet). This was thanks to laura Sheridan, a hearing women, who inquired about accepting women and she was told that deaf women could not enter the institution. In 1887, Gallaudet agreed to allow women to apply with the intent that women would not stay and temporary living arrangments were made..\n\nElectric Hearing Aid Invented\n\nEarly hearing aids were not easy to use. They were often heavy, weighing several pounds. The carbon-based microphones that were powered by large three and six-volt batteries gave hearing impaired people amplified sound for the first time. Alexander Graham Bell reportedly developed an earphone for amplifying sound, but never pursued it with a patent.\n\nNational Deaf-Mute College became Gallaudet College\n\nIn 1865, the 38th Congress removed the instruction that the institution was to educate the blind and became the Columbia Institution fo the Instruction of the Deaf in Dumb. In 1894, it was then renamed as Gallaudet College after T.H.

It was questioned if she was an appropriate role model for deaf children at the time.\n\nUse of Cochlear Implants increases\n\nNucleus 22 device and SPEAK speech processing system (developed at the University of Melbourne, Australia) are the latest technological advances in implantation.
