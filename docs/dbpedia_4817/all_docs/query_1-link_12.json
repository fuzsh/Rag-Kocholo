        "text": "+ Summary\n\nMost deaf children in the United States are born to hearing parents who are not familiar with Deaf culture or American Sign Language (ASL). As a result, deaf children are in danger of experiencing linguistic neglect, meaning they do not receive sufficient language input. This linguistic neglect is typically unintentional and can be a result of deaf history, institutionalized oppression, current stigmas, and educational inequality. Linguistic neglect can result in deaf children experiencing decreased mental health, stunted cognitive development, poor academic performance, and employment difficulties. Several organizations are currently working to address and prevent linguistic neglect by spreading deaf awareness, educating professionals on linguistic neglect, and increasing the prevalence of deaf advocacy groups and support organizations.\n\n+ Key Takeaways\n\n90% of deaf children are born into a family that speaks a language they cannot naturally acquire.\n\nHistorical negative stigmas about Deaf culture and ASL affect institutions’ perceptions of deafness. Institutions generally view deafness as a disease and parents are saddened by the birth of a deaf child.\n\nIf children do not receive frequent, accessible language before the age of 4, they may never achieve fluency in any language which can stunt cognitive development.\n\nASL is the most reliable way to ensure full language input for a deaf child. Manual language develops cognitive structures the same way spoken language does.\n\nLinguistic neglect has negative lifelong impacts on deaf children and can be avoided.\n\n+ Key Terms\n\nLinguistic neglect - A biological state that interferes with the development of neurolinguistic structures in the brain and the necessary developmental processes of early childhood.1\n\nCritical period of language acquisition - A period between birth and age 3 when there is an elevated neurological sensitivity for language development.2\n\nDeaf/deaf - When capitalized, Deaf refers to the Deaf community or culture or to a Deaf individual, if that is the individual’s preference. When not capitalized, it is an adjective used to refer to hearing loss.3 Deaf is a range that includes those with profound deafness (no residual hearing) to those that have enough residual hearing to have a phone conversation. Typically, deaf or hard of hearing people involved in the Deaf community refer to themselves as deaf despite their individual hearing levels.\n\nFunctionally deaf - A state of being completely deaf, not able to hear anything, or having profound deafness.\n\nDeaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH) - This term is the one preferred by the Deaf community. The hearing community often uses the term “hearing impaired,” which is believed to be politically incorrect due to its implication that people who are deaf are lacking.\n\nAccessible language - Language that can be clearly understood and acquired.\n\nLinguistic deprivation - A chronic lack of full access to a natural language during the critical period of language acquisition.4\n\nLanguage input - The exposure learners have to accessible language.5\n\nLanguage modality - A method of communication. There are many types used with deaf children, the most common of which are auditory-oral, ASL, and sign supported speech.6\n\nAuditory-Oral - This approach is focused on developing competency in spoken language. Spoken and auditory language are the primary, if not sole, modes of communication in this approach.\n\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) - As a three-dimensional visual language, ASL relies heavily on spatial organization and locations (the three-dimensional space in front of a person) to hold and communicate information.7 ASL is its own manual language, separate from English, with its own grammar and linguistic rules.\n\nSign Supported Speech (SSS) - A broad category of visual forms of manual English using primarily English syntax and grammar intended to help deaf children learn English.\n\nInstitutionalized Oppression - Attitudes taught covertly or overtly in schools, media, homes, and churches that result in the denigration of a minority group’s language, culture, or personhood. Members of the minority group have no power in the institutions that impact their lives and no opportunities for self-determination.\n\nUnderemployment - A state of not having enough paid work. This can include situations like working less than full time when one wants to be working full time or doing work that doesn’t fully utilize one’s skills.\n\nCochlear implant (CI) - A surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device to provide a person with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss with a modified sense of sound. A CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant who receives intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech.8\n\nIntakes - Reports that are filed then assessed and considered for further action such as legislation towards a policy.9\n\nDeaf History\n\nLinguistic neglect in deaf children in the United States is often a result of the historical interactions between the Deaf and hearing communities that have led to current paradigms about deafness. For years, members of the Deaf community have fought to have their concerns acknowledged because their language was repeatedly stifled through systematic paternalism, which labeled deaf people as a foreign culture to be civilized and assimilated into the majority culture and language.39 Many of the misunderstandings and struggles between deaf and hearing people today stem from a long history of this ignorance and paternalistic mistreatment.\n\nThe earliest records of attitudes toward the Deaf community show that hearing individuals had an aversion to deaf individuals. Historically, deafness was seen as a result of sin.40 Those who were deaf were not allowed to participate in religious rituals due to their inability to hear or speak, which led to the assumption that they were damned. For hundreds of years, it was believed that deaf people could not be educated, which perpetuated hearing individuals’ low expectations for deaf individuals.41 During the 19th century, major medical breakthroughs led to the revival of attempts to cure deafness, but these attempts were not always safe, well regulated, or medically sound.42 Around this time, the American School for the Deaf was established in 1817 as the first school for deaf children in the United States.43 Gallaudet University was subsequently established in 1864 to provide those in the Deaf community the opportunity for higher education; this university remains the only completely deaf-focused college in the world.44 Deaf education continued to develop until Alexander Graham Bell, an influential American scientist and inventor, pushed for oral education during the 1880 International Milan Conference.45 The representatives at this conference voted to ban sign language from deaf education because of the belief that all deaf individuals should learn to speak. Of the 164 delegates at this conference, only 1 was deaf.46 This was the catalyst for what the Deaf community now refers to as the Dark Ages of Deaf history.47\n\nThe biases against deaf individuals are apparent in the ways they have been treated historically, and the same biases remain prevalent today. Hearing individuals have long been part of a majority population; as the longstanding majority, they have been able to control what occurs in the Deaf community through laws and systems put in place without the input of the Deaf community.48 Throughout history, deaf individuals have fought to have the same rights and quality of life as hearing people. Those rights include being recognized as a minority culture with a complete language, receiving an education, having access to job opportunities, and being able to access information. Today, hearing parents are still devastated when they find out their child is deaf and typically turn to medical professionals for ways to cure their child and help him or her function like a hearing person.49 This often harms the child’s language development and can result in linguistic neglect.\n\nEducational Inequality\n\nDeaf education is a relatively recent practice and, as a result of paternalistic institutions, still hinders adequate education and language development among deaf children. Prior to 1880, many deaf children were instructed by deaf teachers, which gave them a place to develop fluent language, cultural awareness, and understanding of school materials.51 The ban on sign language meant most of the deaf instructors were fired and deaf children no longer had the means to learn sign language in school at a young age.52 These events heavily influenced the current deaf education system. Instead of core subject instruction, hours a day were spent teaching deaf children English through oralism, which was only acquired fluently by a few pupils—and well past the critical language acquisition age. Many deaf students are currently enrolled in oral programs, a rise correlated to the increase in cochlear implants.53\n\nSign language is slowly resurfacing in some areas of deaf education, yet other, less beneficial, methods of manual language remain in use. One such method is sign supported speech (SSS), which was created by hearing instructors in order to teach deaf students spoken English.54 It employs English structure and grammar mixed with signs from ASL. Methods such as this do not necessarily close the gap between English and ASL. Instead, they have the potential to confuse deaf students, and students may only partially understand what is taught.55 The poor comprehension of these methods perpetuates language learning challenges for deaf students, which can lead to linguistic deficits and neglect in the classroom.\n\nMediated Education\n\nA shift away from direct education leaves many deaf students with low amounts of information and language input. The majority of deaf students now learn through mediated or interpreted education, meaning students receive instruction secondhand through either a sign language, oral, or cued speech interpreter.56 Mediation also includes instruction received through text, such as transcription of the teacher’s lessons.57 This began in 1975 when the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was passed, stating that all students with disabilities should be taught in the least restrictive environment.58 This caused a majority of deaf children to be transferred out of residential deaf schools, where they experienced direct instruction, to be mainstreamed into public schools, where they were surrounded by almost exclusively hearing peers who learned in spoken English. This made it significantly more difficult for deaf children to learn the information being taught in the classroom.59 Since only 25% of deaf children are currently enrolled in deaf schools, that leaves 75% of deaf children who most likely do not get socialized into Deaf culture or language until after their adolescence.60\n\nCurrent Stigmas\n\nMany deaf children, especially those born to hearing families, suffer language deprivation as a result of their families’ and societies’ insufficient knowledge of the Deaf world. With Deaf and hearing worlds being separated historically, a spectrum of differing views on deafness have emerged. On the ends of the spectrum exist two models of deafness: the sociocultural model and the audiological model. The sociocultural model, typically supported by members and allies of the Deaf community,66 recognizes sign language as a healthy means of communication for the Deaf community. The audiological model, typically the view of medical institutions and hearing parents,67 views deafness as a medical defect that needs to be fixed or cured.68\n\nWhen hearing parents grow up with the stigma that deafness is a tragic disability, it often results in high stress for hearing parents of deaf children.69 In contrast, when a deaf child is born to deaf parents, they are often celebrated. In this scenario, there is no grief about the child being disabled or worry about how parents and child will communicate. Deaf parents teach their children sign language and socialize them into the Deaf community with the full belief that their children can be successful in society. Deaf advocates argue that deaf children are not inherently disabled, but they can be disabled by oppression.70 Viewing deafness as a disability may result in grief among hearing parents; if deaf children and their hearing families do not receive adequate support, negative views of deafness accompanied by grief can lead to further issues of linguistic neglect.71\n\nStudies have shown that deaf children develop language most successfully if their parents determine a language mode in the first 6 months of the deaf children’s lives.72 However, many grieving parents do not have time to thoroughly study their options and make a decision about the best language mode for their child early on; instead, during the initial period of shock and grieving, hearing parents are often being referred to many doctors and professionals such as audiologists. During these appointments, the parents receive a large amount of new information to process and may feel pressured to immediately decide what intervention to put in place. As a result of the negative stigma against deafness, parents are asked to make the major decision about what form of communication will most benefit their deaf child at a time when they are feeling overwhelmed and grieving.73 Decisions that delay language input for deaf children are usually made by parents who believe that it is the best option for their child in the long run.\n\nStigmas Against ASL\n\nFull and continual exposure to sign language allows for the same pattern of language development in deaf children as exposure to spoken language does in hearing children.77 Inversely, lack of exposure to sign language may contribute to some deaf children’s inability to fully develop language skills. Deaf children raised orally must go through specialized programs where they are taught to lip read and have hours of speech therapy each day. Some deaf children in oral programs have cochlear implants (CIs) and hearing aids that have varying levels of success.78 Some deaf children are still unable to acquire spoken language after years of oral programs;79 even with cochlear implants, speech fluency is not guaranteed. Implant surgery typically occurs at 12 months of age and the speech processor and access to quality sound do not occur until 14 to 15 months of age.80 Therefore, even if the children do develop sufficient auditory and oral skills after years of daily speech therapy, they miss that initial year of critical language.81 Thirty percent of children with cochlear implants still do not fully develop language without the help of ASL.82 Even for deaf children who do eventually learn to speak, it typically takes over 5 years to reach a proficient level of oral English. Until these children reach proficiency, they are experiencing linguistic neglect. By this time, the child has passed the critical language acquisition window and is at risk of never developing a language fully, which results in linguistic deprivation.\n\nInstitutionalized Oppression\n\nThe public view on deafness often stems from institutions’ portrayal of hearing as the ideal. When the majority of people view deafness as less-than-ideal, the issue of linguistic neglect is perpetuated because resources and energy are allocated to “curing” deafness rather than to providing children with adequate language input.83 Though some generalized laws in the United States perpetuate this issue, the two main groups at the root of the linguistic neglect issue are Child Welfare Services and medical establishments.84\n\nChild Welfare Services is a government sanctioned program in charge of ensuring the well-being of children in the United States. They protect against the abuse and neglect of children, including inadequate supervision, drug exposure, and physical, emotional, and medical neglect, but they do not include linguistic neglect in their framework.85 Once deaf infants leave the hospital, child welfare workers do not follow up with the child to screen for linguistic neglect.\n\nThe influence of medical establishments often comes into play because many hearing parents have never met a deaf person or been exposed in depth to sign language or Deaf culture before they have a deaf child.86 Without personal experiences, parents must rely on the suggestions of professionals, such as audiologists and primary care doctors, to know what is best for their deaf child. Most medical schools and Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs do not teach material involving the biological foundation of language acquisition, the cognitive harm of linguistic deprivation, or the ability of sign language to meet the same cognitive needs as spoken language.87 As a result of historical events, stigmas, and general lack of Deaf awareness, professionals are often not familiar with ASL as a bona fide language nor are they familiar with Deaf culture. Most audiologists and other influential clinicians involved with deaf children adhere to the pathological view of deafness, meaning they view it as a disease that needs to be cured.88 Often, actions are taken to make the deaf child as “normal” as possible, usually trying to employ interventions that will make the child as similar to a hearing child as possible. This typically includes raising the child in oral English, denying the child the opportunity to learn sign language, and ensuring full inclusion in the hearing world (and, therefore, isolation from the Deaf world) by placing the deaf child in a public school.89\n\nMedical institutions are also a primary contributor to linguistic neglect because medical professionals often do not communicate that hearing parents teaching their deaf children ASL is the most reliable safeguard against linguistic neglect, regardless of whether they implement the “ideal” oral methods or not. This may be due to the fact that deaf language acquisition is not something commonly discussed during medical training and class instruction.90 When parents then express concern about the delayed linguistic development of their child, the medical professionals explain that oral methods inevitably yield delayed results because their child is deaf. However, deaf children that learn ASL acquire language at the same rate as hearing children and can even produce signs before they produce words.91 Deafness does not affect a child’s ability to learn a language, just the ability to hear and speak one.92\n\nAmerican law labels deafness as a disability,93 and hearing culture often treats it as a hindrance. Since major institutions such as the government and the US healthcare system are predominantely run by hearing people, this view of deafness as a disability, or a lack of capability, is perpetuated and eventually becomes group discrimination. Even though the Disability Act, which ensures rights such as equal access, has been in effect for over 25 years, many deaf people are still denied rights. Many deaf individuals, for example, report trying to file lawsuits but being turned away because firms would have to employ an interpreter for communication.94 Despite laws protecting against deaf discrimination, a single American law firm has litigated over 100 deaf discrimination cases.95\n\nConsequences\n\nStunted Cognitive Development\n\nWhen deaf children experience linguistic neglect, their cognitive development is stunted. Development of neurolinguistic structures in the brain rely on a strong language foundation.96 All children need full access to language in their first 3 to 4 years—the critical period for language development and acquisition—in order to achieve natural language fluency and develop all cognitive structures properly.97 Without natural language acquisition, deaf children are inhibited from forming a strong neurological foundation for developing further social and cognitive skills that are necessary to progress in education and society.\n\nMany deaf children raised with only oral communication do not receive enough auditory information to develop a language. Deaf children who are able to learn sign language naturally from an early age are found to have developed strong cognitive structures, including social communication and sustained attention.98 Some deaf children learn to speak and lip read, but ASL is shown to be the most reliable way to prevent linguistic neglect and ensure language acquisition.99 Without effective language modality within the family, deaf children can feel excluded from family communication and receive minimal social and linguistic input. If parents are unable to communicate with their deaf child, the child cannot develop a sense of identity or interpret social structures.100\n\nBecause language and culture are inseparable, fluency in a language is necessary for the child to develop a sense of self and culture. Linguistic neglect prevents the development of empathy and theory of mind, or the ability to interpret and understand other people’s perspectives.101 Empathy and social awareness aid in the development of resilience in dealing with adversity, making it more difficult for deaf children to cope with difficulties.102 Theory of mind deficits mean deaf children suffering from linguistic neglect will not be able to understand that others have their own mental states, therefore making social communication very difficult. Without social communication, children cannot develop cognitive and social skills required for education and a productive life.\n\nMental Health Issues\n\nLinguistic neglect significantly increases the risk of deaf children suffering from mental health issues. Linguistic neglect prevents deaf children from communicating effectively, or at all, with people around them. Research shows that family communication is crucial to child development103 and that deaf children who have trouble communicating with their family are 4 times more likely to experience mental health problems.104 One of the repeatedly listed risk factors for depression is challenging communication in the home, something that is prevalent in homes with deaf individuals. Deaf adults who reported feeling a lack of inclusion and communication within the home showed evidence of greater depression severity.105 Without effective language modality within the family, deaf children feel left out from family communication and receive minimal social and linguistic input. This social rejection and neglect is correlated with depression and sensitivity to stress.106 Language socialization theory states that people learn language and culture simultaneously, so language delays result in isolation from culture and vice versa.107\n\nAs a result of linguistic neglect, which makes job acquisition and retention difficult, deaf individuals are not able to have the same employment opportunities as hearing people.\n\nPractices\n\nEducating Medical Institutions\n\nIn order to combat the tendency to accept linguistic neglect as an inevitable side effect of deafness, organizations that educate institutions on deafness seek to help them understand the causes, prevention strategies, and consequences of linguistic neglect in deaf children. Many institutions are not well informed about the Deaf community or ASL. Several organizations have conducted training with medical students and staff to help them be culturally competent about the Deaf world as well as to provide them with information about ASL and its importance in the Deaf community. This helps equip professionals to provide parents of deaf children with a full range of options and give culturally knowledgeable responses and advice to families about how to best help their deaf children.\n\nThe Deaf Strong Hospital Program (DSH) focuses on holding a one day training with first year medical students to improve cultural competence. Members of the Deaf/deaf community participate in role plays to help the students learn to address relevant cultural, linguistic, and communication needs of deaf patients. DSH aims to improve the quality of health care for deaf people.130 DSH was started in 2000 after a study found that deaf individuals had fewer physician visits and were less likely to see a physician than majority groups due to difficulty communicating feelings of fear, mistrust, and frustration.\n\nThe Deaf Community Training (DCT) program teamed with Medical Student and Cancer Control with the intent of training physicians about Deaf culture to improve the way they care for deaf patients.131 This was a 2-year program that sought to eliminate cultural stigmas surrounding deafness and linguistic barriers between physicians and patients. Part of achieving these aims involved teaching physicians ASL; when physicians can sign, deaf patients are more likely to follow health recommendations and visit physicians regularly.132 The DCT program involved performing research projects about the Deaf community, taking 6 quarters of ASL classes, and completing a summer immersion program at Gallaudet University.133\n\nImpact\n\nDSH tracked the effects of the program through a satisfaction survey of its participants. Of participants that completed the program since 2006, 90% reported that they agree or strongly agree that participation in the program helped them realize the importance of cultural, linguistic, and communication issues in healthcare with deaf patients. In 2012, past participants who had moved on to the clinical portion of their training were contacted and 97% said that the program was a valuable experience. Some of these past participants also reported that they apply lessons they learned from DSH in their clinical practices now.134\n\nDCT gave a survey assessing knowledge of Deaf culture to students who had completed the DCT program, students who had not, and current faculty teaching these students. Out of the 28 questions in the test, DCT students scored a mean of 26.90, faculty scored a mean of 17.07, and non-DCT students scored a mean of 13.79. This demonstrates that students had gained cultural competence from the DCT program that would aid them in treating deaf patients. They were more able to give medical advice with cultural sensitivity and to respect the linguistic importance of manual language.135\n\nGaps\n\nThe statistics reported by these organizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the program in improving the cultural competency of physicians, but no data was reported to determine the effect over time on overall medical treatment for deaf individuals. Additionally, there is no evidence that cultural competency training has helped mitigate the effects of linguistic neglect. The DSH program is praised for its effective implementation at the University of Rochester, yet it is only accessible for medical students who are enrolled in this specific university.136 Furthermore, these programs target medical students only, while there are still gaps in cultural competency among many current medical professionals. The impact of programs like this may be magnified by integrating them into continuous education programs in hospitals throughout the United States.137\n\nEarly Intervention Programs\n\nIn the United States, hearing loss is the most common congenital condition; about 3 out of every 1,000 infants are born with moderate to profound hearing loss. Since child development relies so heavily on language, DHH infants are considered to be in danger of a potential developmental emergency. Their condition needs to be identified as soon after birth as possible. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) mandated Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EDHI) programs in each state in order to try to prevent developmental delays. These programs were put in place because, in the past, it often took months or years for hearing parents to learn that their child was deaf. There are many different programs branching from the federal mandate under the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The goals of the AAP EHDI program are to ensure every child with hearing loss is diagnosed and receives intervention in a timely manner, enhance pediatricians’ and other physicians’ and clinicians’ knowledge of the EDHI guidelines, ensure each state’s newborn hearing screening regulations are communicated to parents, and incorporate EDHI into a medical home approach for child health.138\n\nAfter proper screening, the next step is intervention. Linguistic neglect often occurs in deaf children born to hearing parents who are then not acculturated into the Deaf world. Intervention allows a trained professional to show strategies of effective communication and language development between the parent and child.\n\nImpact\n\nGaps\n\nThough the EDHI greatly improved the efficiency of hearing loss screening in infants, no additional tracking or data collection occurred after enrollment in an intervention course. General statistics show that intervention within the first 6 months is crucial, but because of gaps in data collection, there is no specific information on how linguistic neglect has been affected by EDHI.142 It is difficult to identify with the lack of data, but further research may prove this practice to be extremely effective in addressing linguistic neglect, as it modifies behaviors and provides immediate intervention.\n\nPromoting Deaf Rights\n\nMany policies and institutions have stifled the use of sign language and perpetuated linguistic neglect. The purpose of deaf rights organizations is to fight against unfair laws and opportunities that put deaf individuals, including children, at a disadvantage. This includes advocating for state and federal laws and policies to protect human rights for deaf individuals. As mentioned previously, paternalistic problems arise because most governmental organizations, like the National Board for Education, are run by hearing people. When laws are passed that affect the deaf population, there is not a fair representation of deaf individuals to weigh in on the decision. These organizations seek to facilitate a strong movement of Deaf pride—a movement that rejects the idea that deafness is a disability and promotes the belief that deaf individuals are complete, functioning humans.\n\nThe National Association of the Deaf (NAD) is the largest civil rights organization created by and for the Deaf community in the United States. Their purpose is to ensure civil, human, linguistic, and cultural rights for the deaf population. One of their main focuses is preserving, protecting, and promoting ASL so that deaf individuals do not experience linguistic neglect. The NAD carries out federal advocacy work to improve deaf lives in areas such as early intervention, education, and employment.143 They hold conferences and advocate for public policy that will maintain deaf individuals’ rights. Deaf organizations like the NAD involve deaf individuals in legislative and policy work. This allows experienced deaf people to work to make sign language and deaf education more readily accessible and accepted.\n\nImpact\n\nThe 2017–2018 Annual Report for NAD shows the diverse outputs of the organization. In total, the organization has worked on 5 federal bills: the EHDI, the IDEA Amendment Bill, the Signing is Language Bill, the LEAD-K bill, and the Deaf Children Bill of Rights. They ran several major initiatives including the Gift of Language Campaign, the Parent Advocacy App, and the National Deaf Education Conference with 151 attendees and international presenters from 10 countries. The NAD ran 6 state-level trainings on education advocacy and had 198 education advocacy intakes. In preparing for legislation, they accumulated 44 training hours. The Law and Advocacy center had 1372 intakes. Out of the 275 policy intakes, 39 resulted in policy filings—the majority of which were with the Federal Communications Commission.144\n\nThe organization redesigned the Described and Captioned Media Program website (dcmp.org), which allows deaf people to consume online material. The program added 911 new items, gained 9,053 new members, and had 6.2 million views of their webpage. The NAD was able to promote the development of deaf youth through the Youth Leadership camp of 63 campers and the 26th Biennial Junior NAD Conference of 82 delegates, 38 advisors, and 23 chapters.145\n\nGaps\n\nMuch of the NAD's work is in political advocacy, making it difficult to report solid outcomes or impact. Furthermore, it is difficult to see exactly how linguistic neglect has been affected. The NAD’s goal is long term change of deaf rights, which will trickle down to each individual. With much of this advocacy happening currently, before and after comparisons will not be able to be reported on until the bills have been implemented and had time to take effect."
