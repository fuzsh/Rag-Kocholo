        "text": "Failed trains, low rail adhesion and packed carriages created a second day of Metro misery for commuters across Tyne and Wear on Monday.\n\nThe Metro network was back up and running after a day which saw almost all services cancelled until late evening on Sunday but despite Monday’s return to operation commuters faced a day fraught with problems.\n\nOn Monday evening Tobyn Hughes, the managing director of Nexus, which operates the Metro , issued an open letter to passengers apologising for what he said was an “unprecedented” day in the network’s history.\n\nBut earlier that day passengers could be seen squeezing onto carriages at Wallsend and Chillingham Road when services were running behind schedule due to leaves on the tracks.\n\nTrains travelling between South Shields and South Gosforth, and Benton and South Shields, were beset by delays after two trains were withdrawn while a failed train at Gateshead Stadium added 15 minute delays to services travelling from south of the river.\n\nA Nexus spokesman said Monday’s services were affected when a passenger was taken ill on board a train at Jarrow and there was a fault at Gateshead.\n\nHe added: “We’re sorry for any inconvenience these separate incidents will have caused.\n\n“Metro maintained a frequent service across the day but not to timetable due to low rail adhesion, which reduces the grip beneath trains as leaves are crushed to a slippery pulp beneath wheels.\n\n“We sent out specialist trains to clean the rails which helped keep services on the move across the system.”\n\nRail users took to Twitter to express their anger at the second day of problems.\n\nAndy Raper described the service as “Useless. Incompetent. Embarrassing. Shambolic. Unacceptable. Dangerous. Disgrace.”\n\nGraham Stokoe tweeted: “Feel like David Attenborough - I’ve just see the rarely spotted Metro train.”\n\nAnd Peter Bull said the Metro “desperately needs investment and upgrades more than anything in London does! Hopefully @My_Metro will get some urgently!”\n\nFollowing two days of chaos Councillor Michael Mordey , Sunderland City Council’s portfolio holder for city services, has sought assurances lessons have been learned following what he branded a “catastrophic failure”.\n\nHe added: “I’m very concerned by what can only be classed as a catastrophic failure of the Metro system and I’m seeking urgent assurances from Nexus as to what caused such a devastating disruption and what measures they are putting in place to prevent a repeat.\n\n“The complete suspension of the service in the Sunderland area for the whole day led to severe inconvenience for public transport users in the city, resulting in people being stranded and to the city being cut off from national and international transport connections at Newcastle Central Station and Newcastle International Airport.”\n\nSunday’s network failure coincided with the first sell-out of Newcastle Falcons’ Kingston Park in almost 10 years, as well the Freedom of the Tyne event in the city centre.\n\nBy 6pm on Sunday Nexus had managed to get some trains back on the tracks, running a reduced service between Pelaw and Benton, and Pelaw and Regent Centre.\n\nMr Hughes, in his open letter to passengers, said a full investigation would take place.\n\nHe added: “This is almost unprecedented in Metro’s history and is a serious failure for which I want to apologise.\n\n“We recognise that Sunday was a major failure which will have affected many passengers.\n\n“We will be investigating all aspects of this incident and our response to it so that we can prevent such a failure from happening again, and we will report our findings to the North East Combined Authority.”"
