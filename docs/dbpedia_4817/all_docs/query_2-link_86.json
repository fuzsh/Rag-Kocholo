        "text": "Primary socialization\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Primary socialization\n\nPrimary socialization occurs when a child learns the attitudes, values, and actions appropriate to individuals as members of a particular culture. Primary socialization for a child is very important because it sets the groundwork for all future socialization. It is mainly influenced by immediate family and friends. For example, if a child's mother expresses a discriminatory opinion about a minority or majority group, then that child may think this behavior is acceptable and could continue to have this opinion about that minority or majority group.\n\nSecondary socialization\n\nedit\n\nSecondary socialization refers to the process of learning what is the appropriate behavior as a member of a smaller group within the larger society. Basically, it involves the behavioral patterns reinforced by socializing agents of society. Secondary socialization takes place outside the home. It is where children and adults learn how to act in a way that is appropriate for the situations they are in.[25] Schools require very different behavior from the home, and children must act according to new rules. New teachers have to act in a way that is different from pupils and learn the new rules from people around them.[25] Secondary socialization is usually associated with teenagers and adults[citation needed] and involves smaller changes than those occurring in primary socialization. Examples of secondary socialization may include entering a new profession or relocating to a new environment or society.\n\nAnticipatory socialization\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Anticipatory socialization\n\nAnticipatory socialization refers to the processes of socialization in which a person \"rehearses\" for future positions, occupations, and social relationships. For example, a couple might move in together before getting married in order to try out, or anticipate, what living together will be like.[26] Research by Kenneth J. Levine and Cynthia A. Hoffner identifies parents as the main source of anticipatory socialization in regard to jobs and careers.[27]\n\nResocialization\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Resocialization\n\nResocialization refers to the process of discarding former behavior-patterns and reflexes while accepting new ones as part of a life transition. This can occur throughout the human life-span. Resocialization can be an intense experience, with individuals experiencing a sharp break with their past, as well as a need to learn and be exposed to radically different norms and values. One common example involves resocialization through a total institution, or \"a setting in which people are isolated from the rest of society and manipulated by an administrative staff\". Resocialization via total institutions involves a two step process: 1) the staff work to root out a new inmate's individual identity; and 2) the staff attempt to create for the inmate a new identity.[30] Other examples include the experiences of a young person leaving home to join the military, or of a religious convert internalizing the beliefs and rituals of a new faith. Another example would be the process by which a transsexual person learns to function socially in a dramatically altered gender-role.\n\nOrganizational socialization\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Onboarding\n\nOrganizational socialization is the process whereby an employee learns the knowledge and skills necessary to assume his or her role in an organization.[31] As newcomers become socialized, they learn about the organization and its history, values, jargon, culture, and procedures. Acquired knowledge about new employees' future work-environment affects the way they are able to apply their skills and abilities to their jobs. How actively engaged the employees are in pursuing knowledge affects their socialization process.[32] New employees also learn about their work group, the specific people they will work with on a daily basis, their own role in the organization, the skills needed to do their job, and both formal procedures and informal norms. Socialization functions as a control system in that newcomers learn to internalize and obey organizational values and practices.\n\nGroup socialization\n\nedit\n\nSee also: Group dynamics\n\nGroup socialization is the theory that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, become the primary influence on personality and behavior in adulthood.[33] Parental behavior and the home environment has either no effect on the social development of children, or the effect varies significantly between children.[34] Adolescents spend more time with peers than with parents. Therefore, peer groups have stronger correlations with personality development than parental figures do.[35] For example, twin brothers with an identical genetic heritage will differ in personality because they have different groups of friends, not necessarily because their parents raised them differently. Behavioral genetics suggest that up to fifty percent of the variance in adult personality is due to genetic differences.[36] The environment in which a child is raised accounts for only approximately ten percent in the variance of an adult's personality.[37] As much as twenty percent of the variance is due to measurement error.[38] This suggests that only a very small part of an adult's personality is influenced by factors which parents control (i.e. the home environment). Harris grants that while siblings do not have identical experiences in the home environment (making it difficult to associate a definite figure to the variance of personality due to home environments), the variance found by current methods is so low that researchers should look elsewhere to try to account for the remaining variance.[33] Harris also states that developing long-term personality characteristics away from the home environment would be evolutionarily beneficial because future success is more likely to depend on interactions with peers than on interactions with parents and siblings. Also, because of already existing genetic similarities with parents, developing personalities outside of childhood home environments would further diversify individuals, increasing their evolutionary success.[33]\n\nStages\n\nedit\n\nIndividuals and groups change their evaluations of and commitments to each other over time. There is a predictable sequence of stages that occur as an individual transitions through a group: investigation, socialization, maintenance, resocialization, and remembrance. During each stage, the individual and the group evaluate each other, which leads to an increase or decrease in commitment to socialization. This socialization pushes the individual from prospective to new, full, marginal, and ex member.[39]\n\nStage 1: Investigation This stage is marked by a cautious search for information. The individual compares groups in order to determine which one will fulfill their needs (reconnaissance), while the group estimates the value of the potential member (recruitment). The end of this stage is marked by entry to the group, whereby the group asks the individual to join and they accept the offer.\n\nStage 2: Socialization Now that the individual has moved from a prospective member to a new member, the recruit must accept the group's culture. At this stage, the individual accepts the group's norms, values, and perspectives (assimilation), and the group may adapt to fit the new member's needs (accommodation). The acceptance transition-point is then reached and the individual becomes a full member. However, this transition can be delayed if the individual or the group reacts negatively. For example, the individual may react cautiously or misinterpret other members' reactions in the belief that they will be treated differently as a newcomer.\n\nStage 3: Maintenance During this stage, the individual and the group negotiate what contribution is expected of members (role negotiation). While many members remain in this stage until the end of their membership, some individuals may become dissatisfied with their role in the group or fail to meet the group's expectations (divergence).\n\nStage 4: Resocialization If the divergence point is reached, the former full member takes on the role of a marginal member and must be resocialized. There are two possible outcomes of resocialization: the parties resolve their differences and the individual becomes a full member again (convergence), or the group and the individual part ways via expulsion or voluntary exit.\n\nStage 5: Remembrance In this stage, former members reminisce about their memories of the group and make sense of their recent departure. If the group reaches a consensus on their reasons for departure, conclusions about the overall experience of the group become part of the group's tradition.\n\nGender socialization\n\nedit\n\nHenslin contends that \"an important part of socialization is the learning of culturally defined gender roles\". Gender socialization refers to the learning of behavior and attitudes considered appropriate for a given sex: boys learn to be boys and girls learn to be girls. This \"learning\" happens by way of many different agents of socialization. The behavior that is seen to be appropriate for each gender is largely determined by societal, cultural, and economic values in a given society. Gender socialization can therefore vary considerably among societies with different values. The family is certainly important in reinforcing gender roles, but so are groups - including friends, peers, school, work, and the mass media. Social groups reinforce gender roles through \"countless subtle and not so subtle ways\". In peer-group activities, stereotypic gender-roles may also be rejected, renegotiated, or artfully exploited for a variety of purposes.[41]\n\nCarol Gilligan compared the moral development of girls and boys in her theory of gender and moral development. She claimed that boys have a justice perspective - meaning that they rely on formal rules to define right and wrong. Girls, on the other hand, have a care-and-responsibility perspective, where personal relationships are considered when judging a situation. Gilligan also studied the effect of gender on self-esteem. She claimed that society's socialization of females is the reason why girls' self-esteem diminishes as they grow older. Girls struggle to regain their personal strength when moving through adolescence as they have fewer female teachers and most authority figures are men.\n\nAs parents are present in a child's development from the beginning, their influence in a child's early socialization is very important, especially in regard to gender roles. Sociologists have identified four ways in which parents socialize gender roles in their children: Shaping gender related attributes through toys and activities, differing their interaction with children based on the sex of the child, serving as primary gender models, and communicating gender ideals and expectations.[44]\n\nSociologist of gender R.W. Connell contends that socialization theory is \"inadequate\" for explaining gender, because it presumes a largely consensual process except for a few \"deviants\", when really most children revolt against pressures to be conventionally gendered; because it cannot explain contradictory \"scripts\" that come from different socialization agents in the same society, and because it does not account for conflict between the different levels of an individual's gender (and general) identity.[45]\n\nRacial socialization\n\nedit\n\nRacial socialization, or racial-ethnic socialization, has been defined as \"the developmental processes by which children acquire the behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group, and come to see themselves and others as members of the group\".[46] The existing literature conceptualizes racial socialization as having multiple dimensions. Researchers have identified five dimensions that commonly appear in the racial socialization literature: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, egalitarianism, and other.[47] Cultural socialization, sometimes referred to as \"pride development\", refers to parenting practices that teach children about their racial history or heritage.[48] Preparation for bias refers to parenting practices focused on preparing children to be aware of, and cope with, discrimination. Promotion of mistrust refers to the parenting practices of socializing children to be wary of people from other races. Egalitarianism refers to socializing children with the belief that all people are equal and should be treated with common humanity.[47] In the United States, white people are socialized to perceive race as a zero-sum game and a black-white binary.[49]\n\nOppression socialization\n\nedit\n\nOppression socialization refers to the process by which \"individuals develop understandings of power and political structure, particularly as these inform perceptions of identity, power, and opportunity relative to gender, racialized group membership, and sexuality\".[50] This action is a form of political socialization in its relation to power and the persistent compliance of the disadvantaged with their oppression using limited \"overt coercion\".[50]\n\nLanguage socialization\n\nedit\n\nBased on comparative research in different societies, and focusing on the role of language in child development, linguistic anthropologists Elinor Ochs and Bambi Schieffelin have developed the theory of language socialization.[51] They discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition, but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Members of all societies socialize children both to and through the use of language; acquiring competence in a language, the novice is by the same token socialized into the categories and norms of the culture, while the culture, in turn, provides the norms of the use of language.\n\nPlanned socialization\n\nedit\n\nPlanned socialization occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others. This type of socialization can take on many forms and can occur at any point from infancy onward.[52]\n\nNatural socialization\n\nedit\n\nNatural socialization occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them.[53] Natural socialization is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds).[54] On the other hand, planned socialization is mostly a human phenomenon;[55] all through history, people have made plans for teaching or training others.[56] Both natural and planned socialization can have good and bad qualities: it is useful[for whom?] to learn the best features of both natural and planned socialization in order to incorporate them into life in a meaningful way.[57]\n\nPolitical socialization\n\nedit\n\nSocialization produces the economic, social, and political development of any particular country. The nature of the compromise between nature and nurture also determines whether society is good or harmful.[58] Political socialization is described as \"the long developmental process by which an infant (even an adult) citizen learns, imbibes and ultimately internalizes the political culture (core political values, beliefs, norms and ideology) of his political system in order to make him a more informed and effective political participant.\"[59]\n\nA society's political culture is inculcated in its citizens and passed down from one generation to the next as part of the political socialization process. Agents of socialization are thus people, organizations, or institutions that have an impact on how people perceive themselves, behave, or have other orientations. In contemporary democratic government, political parties are the main forces behind political socialization.[59]\n\nSocialization enhances business, trade, and foreign investment globally.[citation needed] Building technology is made easy, is improved and carried out due to the ease with which interaction in interest services and media work can be connected.[citation needed] Citizens must instil in themselves excellent morals, ethics, and values and must preserve human rights or have sound judgment to be able to lead a country to a higher developmental level in order to construct a decent and democratic society for nation-building.[citation needed] Developing nations can transfer agricultural technology and machinery like tractors, harvesters, and agrochemicals to enhance the agricultural sector of the economy through socialization.[60]\n\nPositive socialization\n\nedit\n\nPositive socialization is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. Individual humans tend to like the people who fill their social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities. Positive socialization occurs when desired behaviors are reinforced with a reward, encouraging the individual to continue exhibiting similar behaviors in the future.[52]\n\nNegative socialization\n\nedit\n\nNegative socialization occurs when socialialization agents use punishment, harsh criticisms, or anger to try to \"teach us a lesson\"; and often we come to dislike both negative socialization and the people who impose it on us.[52] There are all types of mixes of positive and negative socialization, and the more positive social learning experiences we have, the happier we tend to be—especially if we are able to learn useful information that helps us cope well with the challenges of life.[citation needed] A high ratio of negative to positive socialization can make a person unhappy, leading to defeated or pessimistic feelings about life.[52]"
