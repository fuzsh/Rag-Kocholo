        "text": "Lookers has adopted Nissan GB’s new car dealership corporate identity at its Carlisle retail site after completing a £750,000 upgrade of the facility.\n\nOriginally developed in 1990, the Lookers Nissan dealership on the city’s Rosehill Industrial Estate has been “future proofed” by the project which saw the business temporarily close its doors earlier this year to facilitate a complete redesign and upgrade.\n\nA considerably larger floor area with ample room for up to 12 vehicles has resulted from the work, according to Lookers, allowing it to accommodate new Nissan models, more customers and its growing team of 42 staff.\n\nThe enlarged showroom also features a new two-car bay customer handover area and a new customer lounge area, facilitated by a move for the dealership’s sales and service offices.\n\nGraham Stokoe, Lookers Nissan Carlisle’s general manager, said: “This investment in our Nissan Carlisle showroom is a positive sign for the future and the local economy and a real gamechanger for the area.\n\n“We’re excited to be welcoming customers back to see and experience this transformation and to enjoy the extensive range of new and approved used Nissan models in real style and comfort.”\n\nHawkins Group and Griffin Mill Garges became the first UK Nissan franchisees to adopt its new CI back in July.\n\nSince then, AM has reported on Cars2's agreement to take on the former Harratts Motor Group Nissan franchise in Wakefield and Wessex Garages' opening of a new dealership in Newport.\n\nNissan GB managing director Andrew Humberstone gave an update on the Japanese brand’s UK strategy in a manufacturer profile feature published in the latest edition of AM magazine this week.\n\nThe brand recently welcomed the latest generation Qashqai SUV into its dealerships and will soon introduce its all-new, all-electric Ariya SUV to the UK market.\n\n“Post Brexit, post-COVID, we’re at the right time in the right place with the right new product,” Humberstone told AM.\n\nCommetning on Lookers’s Carlisle dealership upgrade, Steve Eley, Lookers Nissan Franchise Director said: “As the UK moves to all-electric driving and petrol and diesel cars begin to take a back seat, Nissan is playing a pivotal role with a new and innovative range of electric and hybrid models and we’re delighted for Nissan to be partnering with us on this incredible journey.\n\n“This amazing new state-of-the-art space has been perfectly designed to showcase the best of Nissan including the highly anticipated new Ariya electric crossover due in our showroom in the new year, the fully-electric Nissan LEAF and the new mild hybrid Nissan Qashqai.”"
