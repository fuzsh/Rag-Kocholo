Welcome to my musical world! This is one man’s attempt to alert you to the best in area entertainment!

Eryn Shewell was born in Washington D.C and moved to New Jersey when she was very young; what a gain for the Garden State that has turned out to be!

I can describe this East Windsor resident in many ways, but I always seem to sum it up best when I say, ‘The lady can just flat out sing!’

When you first meet this young artist with the soft speaking voice, one would never expect the power that lurks within.

The first time that I ever saw Shewell perform was several years ago at a festival. I remember being under a large tent that doubled as the musicians green room on this hot, sticky day when I saw a pair of high heels come cautiously down the small slope that led to where we were at the bottom. Little did I know that this young lady, dressed more appropriately for a vintage Bogart movie than an outdoor festival, was about to bring the ‘WOW’ factor into play.

Upon taking the stage, her presence dominated the cast of top-notch performers that make up her fine band, which, I can assure you is no easy task. Shewell’s stunning vocal ability, vivacious and (at times) back in time looks command attention.

When this woman belts out a tune, people can’t help but take notice. Eryn’s vocals can seemingly transport her audience to another era, a simpler time perhaps, where she can go as soft as a song bird, or as powerful as a freight train as she delivers her brand of original music mixed with apropos blues and jazz standards that leave the crowd craving more.

I found it hard to believe after recent conversations with her that she only took vocal lessons for a few months.

‘I started singing, well, I was kind’a born into it (laughing),’ she said. ‘My family are all musicians, very musical. I took vocal lessons briefly from (Asbury Park area’s) Jody Joseph, but no other (formal) vocal lessons.’

Even though her voice may be considered her primary instrument, Eryn also writes her material on her guitar. I was surprised to discover that she’d only been playing for a short time.

‘I started playing about five years ago,’ she said. ‘I’ve never taken a lesson. If there’s something that I’m having trouble with I just ask (her guitarist) Pat (Ruh).’

After two modestly successful CDs and the recent completion of ‘Children At Play,’ a live acoustic CD, which captures Shewell in pure, raw talent form, Eryn is far from done making music. Currently, she is in the recording studio laying down ten new tracks that will make up her fourth disc. This still yet untitled effort will be ‘Scaled back’ in an attempt to ‘Keep it simple,’ says Shewell.

‘I’m in the process of recording and trying to raise the money to pay for this,’ she said. ‘I released a single and a live video of a new song, ‘Boy Like You’ that I co-wrote with Alice Leon that’s probably going to be on the disc.’

I asked her how the relationship with a very accomplished musician such as Leon came about.

‘I was a fan of hers when I was younger,’ she said. ‘My dad used to take me to see her when I was a kid. We connected on facebook and now we’ve written a couple of songs together.’

On writing her music she says, ‘Every song is different. Sometimes I write lyrics first, sometimes it’s the music first. Sometimes they both come together at the same time. It’s always different. I think it gives me my diverse style…..(laughing) I don’t know if that’s good or bad!’

What does the future hold for this talented songstress?

With a hearty laugh Shewell said, ‘I wish I knew! I’m looking to promote the new CD and my music overseas. I’m looking into finding a booking agent to do a European tour. I’m also hoping that people buy the CD and like it!’

The immediate future is very busy for Eryn and the band. The day after I interviewed her for this column, she left for a week long tour that will take her to various stops in one of her favorite cities — New Orleans.

‘I love going down there,’ she said. ‘I try to make it at least once, if not twice a year. We’ll be playing across from where the jazz fest is being held again this year at several places, then we’ll be making stops in Nashville and North Carolina on our way back.’

A very hard working musician both on stage and off, Shewell sets up these tours and gigs all on her own without the aide of a manager.

I’ve been fortunate enough to see Shewell numerous times as well as interview her on several occasions. I can sit here and write about how amazingly powerful her voice is, how talented she is, how great she looks on stage and how she can take over any setting, but none of the words will do her justice. My suggestion is to listen to her music which is available on CD Baby, iTunes, Amazon.com and from her directly at www.erynshewell.com, go see her live, then let me know if I am wrong. I’m betting that I’m not. Eryn Shewell plays shows all over our area from Princeton, to the Jersey shore, in New York City and beyond. Believe me when I say, check her and her band out, it’s well worth the trip!

Some shows worth checking out this weekend are Friday, Beannacht with Lo Kloza and Jeff Rupert at the Grover’s Mill Coffee House located at 335 Princeton-Hightstown Rd. in West Windsor. Stop on by and have a cup of java along with some fantastic sweet treats as you listen to these superb singer/ songwriters in an intimate setting. The show is an early start time of 7:30 p.m., is family/kid friendly and admission is free.

Another all ages show on Friday is Billy Hector at The Record Collector in Bordentown. Join this great artist as he plays his versions of the blues in The Record collector’s ‘Living Room’ setting. The Record Collector is located at 358 Farnsworth Ave. and tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the door.

Coming up next week, May 11, the third installment of the now monthly ‘Singer/Songwriter Night’ at Cedar Gardens Pub will be taking place. This month’s lineup is as diverse as it is talented. Stay tuned and check back here next week as there will be more information forthcoming.

That’s it for now. So until next week, please continue to support live and original music, your local musicians and as always…ROCK ON!
