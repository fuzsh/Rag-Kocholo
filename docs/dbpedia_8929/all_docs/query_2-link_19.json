        "text": "Birthdays represent the artificial time line that for some reason makes me reflect on where I am on that day. So here I go publicly reflecting...\n\nThis has been a year where I haven't done as many \"Live\" solo and band gigs. After nearly 30 years there has been a natural slowing down. With the band rehearsing and churning out CD's it seemed natural to book and tour like crazy. There are moments when I miss it immensely. Many of my friends and bandmates are still in the game and I get pangs of wanting to get back in. My truth at the moment is that I love sharing songwriting with others as a teaching artist. Every day is incredibly rewarding and I feel I'm doing important work helping to spark creativity through the language of music and video. With each song and lyric written, I'm reminded of why it's been my life work. The hours are great as well. So for the foreseeable future, I will continue along this path, but don't be surprised if you see some more \"Live\" gigs pop up on my calendar. There's something to to be said for the phrase \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"\n\nIt’s been 6 years since I added here\n\nA little story dating back to Greenwich Village 1984 @The Bitter End... I was standing on the side of the stage waiting for my turn to play a set (there were 4 bands that night). I watched a lead singer belting out a song. She was wonderful but pretty old as I judged her to be in her mid 30’s. I swore to myself that if I wasn’t a super star with a huge record contract by the time I was her age I would definitely not be playing small clubs like this. There was no way that judgy self absorbed girl (me) could have anticipated the long and winding musical journey I was just at the beginning of that night. So here I am 37 years later with a cache of albums, experiences, accolades, heartaches along with a zillion little euphoric moments and I can’t wait to play at 3 small venues this week to usher in my 60th year around the sun. Stop by and say hi to this old girl. Thu. 11/18- Ricks Club American Congers NY 7-10, Sat. 11/20 - Torne Valley Vineyards 1-5 under the heated tent with Al and Jimmy Leahey., Sun. 11/21 Tin Barn Brewing 2-5\n\nSo I thought I'd reflect for a moment as we all have a tendency to do at the artificial end of a year. 2013 was a year where I personally said goodbye to some dear friends... Larisa Vaynberg and Brett Walker. I looked up to Larisa as a mentor. She had gone through so many real trials in her life becoming a top tennis competitor in her homeland of Russia only to be left out of the big tournaments because she was born Jewish. Emigrating to America after Chernobyl with her 2 babies, husband, twin sister and parents with nothing but the clothing on their backs. Working first as a housekeeper and eventually becoming a top tennis coach in Princeton. She was genuine, funny, fair, loving, hardworking and a role model to me. Brett Walker and I never met, but he was an incredible cheerleader for me and my music. We spoke hundreds of times on the phone. Placing my songs in countless TV shows and telling me all the time that my music was awesome and he valued it. That meant a great deal coming from someone who had achieved so much in the music biz. He passed away suddenly and too young as did Larisa. There were loads of wonderful things this year though... My son Eli finished elementary school and started Middle school. Became a black belt in TKD, Played his original classical piano pieces at the Liedenkrantz music hall as part of the Rondo music festival, made it to two travel baseball teams, really cut his hair for the first time and grew about 6 inches. Al Greene played some amazing gigs this year including Lincoln Center and learned how to play bass and drums at the same time. He also decided to embark on his journey into the martial arts. He helped me produce and engineered my last CD and is working on a new one with me.\n\nThis year, I released my CD \"It's all making sense\" which caught the ears of a number of film makers working on Tesla films. It was a chance to co-write with Jimmy Leahey and Eryn Shewell. I had a sold out show at the Turning Point which was amazing. My work as a teaching artist grew ten fold and it's an amazing fit for me. We did a bunch of traveling and made our yearly pilgrimage to my favorite spot on earth...Sedona Arizona. Time goes so fast and I've decided that even the crappy times should go slowly because I don't want any of this to end too soon. There's loads more to say...but I think I'll just add those thoughts to my next batch of songs....\n\nPeace out....\n\nYou know how it is. When you leave your house looking like a wreck to drop something off at the post office or pick up something at the dollar store, you tend to run into everyone you know. Well to that point, I've been observing that most people look like a wreck. It seems like we've given up or something. Crazy hair, old sweats, flip flops, no make up...basically no effort. I think about my Dad working on the lawn in the 70's wearing dress pants. I see pictures of Yankee stadium in the 60's and everyone was dressed up. Even going to a concert or the movies was something people dressed for. My Mom never left the house without make up on and my Grandmother always wore a dress. I'm not saying that nobody cares...I'm just saying that less do. I remember arriving at gigs in the 80's and 90's dressed up and bringing my \"cool\" stage wear. We all did. Now it seems there is no difference between the audience in a concert setting (except big shows) and the band or performer. Is this a bad thing? I don't know, but today I put on a red dress ,gold platform shoes and put on make up just to go to Lowes to look at refrigerators. Of course I didn't run into anyone I know, but I did feel pretty good and confident in the event that I did."
