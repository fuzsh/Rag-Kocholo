The concept behind APDT is that donations it receives are spent at local eateries to purchase meals for those in need.\n\nHeading up the formidable talent roster is Johnny Rzeznik, lead singer of superstar rock act, The Goo Goo Dolls. He'll be joined by 18 other artists including longtime Bruce Springsteen collaborator Joe Grushecky and his band, The Houserockers, Jim Babjak of The Smithereens, Jersey Shore favorites The Weeklings and a host of acclaimed singer-songwriters, among them Richard Barone of The Bongos, James Maddock, Ben Arnold and Danielia Cotton. Each artist will perform one song. See below for the complete list of participants.\n\nThe event will formally kick off right before 11 a.m. as Tom Cunningham, host of the Jersey Shore Sunday morning radio institution Springsteen on Sunday on 107.1 \"The Boss,\" will \"shine a light\" on the presentation and direct his listeners to Light of Day's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAxn20nnBJoPVkfyiqxjcLg) channel and Facebook page (www.facebook.com/LOD2000).\n\nYou can also join the APDT Watch Party at https://www.facebook.com/APDinnerTable.\n\nThis very special event is being staged by the Asbury Park-based Light of Day Foundation (LOD), whose annual January-long concert series in support of Parkinson's Disease research and treatment have been a Jersey staple for more than two decades. \"As winter approaches and the issue of food insecurity during this COVID crisis grows, The Light of Day Foundation will 'shine its light' in an effort to raise money and awareness to support its spiritual hometown and the great work of Asbury Park Dinner Table,\" said Tony Pallagrosi, LOD's executive director and co-founder.\n\n\"The Asbury Park Dinner Table is honored to have the Light of Day Foundation \"shine a light\" on us as we now face the Winter months, which normally are stark in Asbury Park, but now are at a crisis stage with the addition of the pandemic. We also thank and appreciate the artists donating their time and talent to this concert fundraiser in the Asbury Park community spirit that many of us know is something very special,\" added Allison Kolarik, co-founder, Asbury Park Dinner Table.\n\n'SHINE A LIGHT' PERFORMERS:\n\nJohnny Rzeznik (Goo Goo Dolls)\n\nJim Babjak of The Smithereens\n\nBrian Dunne\n\nLisa Bouchelle\n\nMatt & Eryn O'Ree\n\nDanielia Cotton\n\nWilliams Honor\n\nRichard Barone (The Bongos)\n\nPeter Elkas\n\nBen Arnold\n\nJoe Grushecky & The Houserockers\n\nJohn Easdale (Dramarama)\n\nEmily Grove\n\nJames Maddock\n\nScott Elk & Kyle Ward\n\nBobby Mahoney\n\nBilly Hector\n\nThe Weeklings\n\nJoe D'Urso & Stone Caravan\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\nETSY TO LEGENDARY PRODUCERS KENNETH GAMBLE & LEON HUFF: 'YOU GOT WHAT I NEED'\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Legendary Philadelphia International Records (PIR) co-founders and R&B pioneers Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff have a new commercial placement from their massive song catalogue. \"YOU GOT WHAT I NEED,\" which Gamble & Huff wrote and produced in 1968 for Freddie Scott - three years before launching PIR - is currently getting massive TV exposure in a new ETSY.COM commercial. Philadelphia International Records was home to The O'Jays, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and many other acts that defined the Philadelphia soul sound of the '70s.\n\n\"Seeing the Etsy commercial featuring the song on TV so prominently, makes us instantly reflect back 52 years, when we wrote and produced the song in the studio for Freddie Scott - a great, yet unsung Soul/R&B artist and vocalist,\" said Gamble & Huff in a joint statement. \"We are so glad this original song and Freddie are getting their just recognition and their due.\"\n\nUsage of \"YOU GOT WHAT I NEED\" has proven popular for sampling in recent years. But this is the first time the original recording is anchoring a popular TV commercial in the U.S.\n\nRapper Biz Markie used many elements of the original recording on his 1989 hit \"Just A Friend.\" Kanye West, Common, Pusha T and Big Sean feat. Kid Cudi and Charlie Wilson sampled the song on \"Good Friday\" (2010). Ghostface Killah sampled it on \"Save Me Dear\" (2004). And in 2017, Janelle Monáe sang \"You Got What I Need\" in a Gap commercial promoting their Christmas offerings.\n\n\"YOU GOT WHAT NEED\" originally reached #27 on the R&B chart. Scott died in 2007 at age 74.\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\nSUICIDE, ITALIAN STYLE: AN ALBUM UNLIKE ANY OTHER YOU'LL HEAR IN 2020; Joe Ferrara, in Guise of THE ANDRETTI, Stakes Claim as The Mad Scientist of Rock\n\nMars Volta drummer Blake Fleming among passengers on 2020's wildest musical ride\n\nOut NOW in special multi-colored collector's vinyl and on all major digital platforms.\n\n\"These songs are about the excesses of the ancient Romans; out of work soap opera stars who are now arms dealers; male prostitute blackmailers; race car drivers with a death wish; a castle made of junk auto parts that functions as a 'lovers lane' in some fictional border town; Faustian death cults; the New Jersey mafia and, of course, Kim Novak. Or they are not about any of these things. I honestly couldn't tell ya.\" - Joe Ferrara, aka THE ANDRETTI\n\nStream & Download 'Suicide, Italian Style'\n\nPHILADELPHIA (Oct. 1, 2020) - Prepare yourself for 2020's wildest musical ride. That's the only way to describe Suicide, Italian Style, the mind-blowing new release from THE ANDRETTI, out NOW in special multi-colored collector's vinyl, available exclusively through Bandcamp, and on all major digital platforms.\n\nSpringing from the heart, soul and intellect of veteran music-maker Joe Ferrara, Suicide, Italian Style is the aural equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting: A creation of challenging, compelling, and ultimately satisfying order borne from a seemingly random and chaotic sonic chaos that melds David Bowie with Dick Dale, Ennio Morricone, Frank Zappa and Henry Mancini. The album is sprinkled with just enough '60s experimentation, '70s glam, '80s bombast and '90s noise rock to conjure a collection of songs (with elements of exotica and Latin, rockabilly, surf, doo wop and metal) that grabs the listener on the first spin and refuses to let go.\n\nThis \"mad-scientist\" approach stands in stark contrast to contemporary music's auto-tuned, disposable-pop default position. So, what would compel its creator to devise such an adventurous, impossible-to-pigeonhole collection of songs?\n\n\"The album was motivated by a desire to create songs I find interesting and which incorporate many different styles, but still maintain a classic pop sensibility,\" says North Jersey denizen Ferrara ,now living in suburban Philadelphia. \"Also,\" he adds in his signature sardonic style, \"I had nothing better to do.\"\n\nAs for the disc's lyrical content, Ferrara is hard to pin down, but on the other hand, he admits even he doesn't have a real handle on it.\n\n\"Lyrically, there is no unifying theme except, perhaps, the songs all explore some of the darker and/or abnormal aspects of human behavior. Most of the time I just like to construct phrases that sound pleasing - or displeasing - when sung.\n\n\"As a result, my lyrics are often fairly abstract, and don't necessarily follow a traditional narrative or commentative structure. Without giving too much away, if I had to be specific, I'd say these songs are about the excesses of the ancient Romans; out of work soap opera stars who are now arms dealers; male prostitute blackmailers; race car \"drivers with a death wish; a castle made of junk auto parts that functions as a 'lover's lane' in some fictional border town; Faustian death cults; the New Jersey mafia and, of course, Kim Novak.\n\n\"Or they are not about any of these things. I honestly couldn't tell ya.\"\n\nAlthough Suicide, Italian Style - whose title Ferrara describes as a takeoff on 1960s films Love Italian Style and Divorce Italian Style - is released under the banner of THE ANDRETTI, it is decidedly not a band effort. While he did enlist a few outside musicians including Mars Volta drummer Blake Fleming, Ferrara insists the concept of the musical collaboration is not one to which he subscribes.\n\n\"I don't think the band concept is passe for everyone,\" he says, \"but I certainly think the notion of music being presented as the sum total of a small collective of people's efforts, and then that music being absorbed through the prism of a perception of that group that is formulated by marketing the style or personality or demographic that \"band\" conveys through its media presence, is a pretty stale tactic.\n\n\"Who makes the music doesn't matter. The music should matter - especially to an angry fuck like me with his cigarettes and vintage microphones.\"\n\nUltimately, Suicide, Italian Style is by turns prickly, slightly askew, random, and challenging, but somehow, it's also thrilling, entertaining and irresistible. So strap yourself in and join The Andretti for a most unforgettable \"Suicide\" trip.\n\nAvailable NOW at Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon, and wherever else music is consumed online.\n\n'Suicide, Italian Style' Track Listing:\n\nIl Pavone D'oro\n\nEquinox at Cefalù\n\nMarquis De Sade's Rockin' NYE\n\nSuicide, Italian Style\n\nDigitalEvil\n\nThe Man Who Never Was\n\nThe Soft Side Of Hell\n\nNew Jersey Jailbreak\n\nA Dismal Method\n\nPalace Depression\n\nSee Naples and Die\n\nA Seedy Type Of Gravity\n\nGenre: Experimental, progressive, glam, surf, exotica, Latin, rockabilly, doo wop, alternative, metal\n\nRIYL: Mars Volta, David Bowie, Quentin Tarantino, Mr. Bungle, Dick Dale, Ennio Morricone, Esquivel, Frank Zappa, Henry Mancini, John Zorn, The Beach Boys, and of course, Kim Novak.\n\nSeptember 3, 2020\n\nSUPERSTAR PATTI LaBELLE JOINS ONE WORLD 'CELEBRITY CIRCLE' AS HISTORIC CHARITY ANTHEM FOR GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE RE-ENTERS BILLBOARD TOP 30 AT #27 WITH A BULLET\n\n'Truly Global' Collaboration Kicks Off Drive-In Theater Initiative TONIGHT and Sept. 12 on Long Island\n\nSocial Media Fans Clamor to Praise One World as 'Breath of Fresh Air' with 'A Message That Is So Desperately Needed'\n\n'Voices 4 One World' Chorus of Grammy Winners and Multi-Grammy Nominees Become Historic Alliance to Support Musicians Foundation, The Actors Fund, First Responders Children's Foundation and NAACP Legal Defense Fund\n\nDonate NOW and Watch the Music Video at www.oneworldoursong.com\n\nWith entertainers out of work, first responders overworked and racial unrest around the country, Franke Previte wants to remind us we are all the same voices existing in \"One World.'\"\n\n- American Songwriter\n\nNEW YORK (Sept. 3, 2020) - ONE WORLD, the timely and historic \"We Are the World\" style new charity anthem for the global pandemic - supporting musicians, actors and first responder families while changing America's racial narrative - officially welcomes superstar Godmother of Soul Patti LaBelle to its \"Celebrity Circle\" as the \"truly global\" multi-vocalist track re-enters the Billboard Top 30 Mainstream Adult Contemporary chart this week, landing at No. 27 with a bullet.\n\nONE WORLD also has entered the Radio Media charts at #28 with a bullet and has passed 20,000 spins on Pandora, where it is now a featured artist track.\n\nThis extraordinary new recording, featuring an unprecedented chorus of Grammy Award winners and multiple Grammy nominees collectively known as Voices for One World, is being offered as a free download with any donation to the major charity beneficiaries, exclusively through www.oneworldoursong.com.

The ensuing album included the original Earth, Wind & Fire recording of ONE WORLD. The lyrics in the new recording have been lovingly updated to address the current COVID-19 crisis and, says Previte, \"give hope to all mankind for us to dream again.\" Every creative participant is an \"UnSung Hero\" to the global music community who has collaborated with superstars across many genres.\n\nAmerican Songwriter calls the new version of ONE WORLD \"a hopeful song of unity that recalls some of the '80s most anthemic message songs, led by powerful vocal performances from an ensemble of well-respected, top-notch singers.\" ONE WORLD also has earned coverage from the Associated Press, the USA Today Network, The Jim Brickman Show (Westwood One), Premiere Radio/iHeart Media \"Classic Rock Daily,\" Medium's Authority Magazine, Arianna Huffington's Thrive Global, and major radio stations including NPR Chicago's Lakeshore Public Radio and WGN Chicago.\n\nONE WORLD made its world radio premiere this summer via Entercom during the Bob Pantano Saturday Night Dance Party, heard around the world (and nationally to Comcast subscribers) through the Radio.com app, and throughout the Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey region on five radio stations, anchored by flagship 98.1 WOGL. Pantano continues his commitment to play ONE WORLD on every broadcast.\n\nIn late July, \"Ambassador of Soul\" Ellis Hall, one of the song's primary \"Voices 4 One World,\" performed ONE WORLD for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) during the first-ever \"live virtual music concert\" under the Artists UNited Against Human Trafficking initiative.\n\nAll singers on the new recording have contributed to the greatness of recorded and live music as musicians and background singers, many of whom are Grammy Award winners and multiple Grammy nominees. Singing with Hall on the record are Michael Mayo (Josh Groban, Herbie Hancock), Ronee Martin (Patti LaBelle, Wynton Marsalis), Tower of Power \"Ambassador of Soul\" Ellis Hall, Dorian Holley (Michael Jackson, Rod Stewart), Grammy winner Judith Glory Hill (Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Prince), Valerie Pinkston (Lenny Kravitz, Luther Vandross, Annie Lennox), Amy Keys (Herbie Hancock, Sting, Barbra Streisand), Christine Collister (Richard Thompson Band), and Lisa Sherman (Jon Bon Jovi, Blondie). Musicians are Jon Gilutin (James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt) keyboards; Lenny Castro (Toto), percussion; Brendan Buckley (Shakira, Perry Farrell), drums; Scott Mayo (Earth Wind & Fire), saxophone; Jerry Watts Jr. (Andraé Crouch, Dr. John), bass; James Harrah (Melissa Etheridge, Leonard Cohen), guitar; Randy Jacobs (Was Not Was), guitar; and Tollack Ollestad (Don Henley, Andrea Boccelli), harmonica.\n\nThe range of charities reflects the scope and breadth of the pandemic's devastating impact on the community. All live music-related performances: touring, concert, theatrical, Broadway, TV, film - have ground to a halt. Musicians and singers are unable to earn a living in front of live audiences. The touring infrastructure - crews, road managers, talent buying, concert promotion - has been left in disarray, with no true sense of normalcy projected to be returning for another year at least.\n\nPrevite and Oland were among 22 renowned USA songwriters in \"Music Speaks Louder Than Words,\" joining such notable participants as Diane Warren, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Bolton, Brill Building legends Mike Stoller and Barry Mann, Desmond Child (Bon Jovi), Brenda Russell (Earth Wind & Fire, Donna Summer, Rufus), songwriting team Billy Steinberg & Tom Kelly (Madonna, Whitney Houston), Franne Golde (Jody Watley, Commodores), and Alan Roy Scott (Motown, Celine Dion, Cher).\n\nThe new recording of ONE WORLD was produced by Grammy winner Jon Gilutin (\"New Attitude\") and mixed by Grammy, Emmy and Dove Award-winning engineer Bill Schnee (Steely Dan, Natalie Cole). The video was produced by Thomas Ryan Ward.\n\nThe participants in the ONE WORLD project profusely thank and honor the First Responders, and the sacrifices they and their families, including their children, are making to help all of us.\n\nONE WORLD is available digitally on Spotify, Apple Music, and iTunes.\n\nPHOTO CAPTION: Composite photo of the five lead singers of \"One World,\" Ellis Hall (center), and clockwise from top left, Michael Mayo, Judith Glory Hill, Dorian Holley, and Ronee Martin.

Forty years later it breaks my heart to see my friends and neighbors sitting for hours in a line for emergency food distribution. That's why we need Joe Biden.\"\n\nPat Politano, a Pittsburgh native, New Jersey-based political consultant and convention delegate, helped to arrange Grushecky's performance.\n\n\"Joe sings about the soul of Pittsburgh, which is the soul of America,\" Politano said. \"He speaks directly to the people of Pennsylvania and his selection shows how important Pennsylvania is to the campaign. The campaign is a battle for the soul of the nation.\"\n\nBeau Biden, the Vice-President's late son, attended Joe Grushecky's show at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia in 1995, part of the American Babylon tour. Beau Biden died of a brain tumor in 2015. Beau was a Joe Grushecky fan and \"Never Be Enough Time\" is being played in tribute to him.\n\nAugust 19, 2020\n\nRISING AMERICANA ARTIST TOM SLESS RELEASES MUSIC VIDEO 'ASTRONAUT' AMID HIGH PRAISE FOR 'ASSURANCE, CRAFT AND CONVICTION' ON 'UPLIFTING' DEBUT ALBUM, 'CALIFORNIA DREAM'\n\nFirst Music Video from 'California Dream' Premieres Today at American Songwriter\n\n\"Tom Sless knew he had to break free from the conventional life if he was going to soar high with his original music and leave a lasting artistic impression. And what better metaphor than imagining he was an astronaut, as he does on his latest single 'Astronaut,' a highly biographical pop treat.\" - American Songwriter\n\nLOS ANGELES (Aug. 19, 2020) - The music video for the shimmering pop-inflected track, \"Astronaut,\" the first video from LA based Americana singer-songwriter-guitar slinger TOM SLESS's critically-acclaimed debut album, California Dream, premieres today at American Songwriter, noting how the song \"bops along with a cheery, musically positive outlook as Sless sings confessional lyrics of the struggles and nagging insecurities we all confront.\"\n\nThe exclusive music video premiere follows an early summer review in the magazine which marveled how the album's \"assurance, craft and conviction belie the fact that [Tom]'s a novice or a newcomer of any kind. ... Great stuff indeed.\" The review also responded to the question \"Astronaut\" poses in its lyrics: Will anyone remember me? \"Based on the evidence offered here,\" said the reviewer, \"the answer is an emphatic yes indeed.\"Disciples of Sound cited \"Astronaut\" for recalling \"Long Player Late Bloomer-era Ron Sexsmith [matching] quirky songwriting with full bodied arrangements that moved between pop and rock. There's so much of that same kind of quality to be found here and that's where the sizzle sits and stays.\"\n\nWith its rowdy country-folk chorus, and propelled by searing guitars on the bridge, \"Astronaut\" urges us never to regret the past, but to let go of it and reach out and embrace what you're supposed to do.\n\nRead and watch the video HERE.\n\n\"'Astronaut' illustrates the main insecurity I faced after deciding to redirect my life's focus toward my music,\" says Sless. \"Pursuing music full-time was following the only dream I had since I was a kid, and I felt uncertainty as to whether I would be able to realize that dream. However, processing those emotions through writing this song helped me understand more about what 'making it' and 'worth it' really meant. In my case, my pursuit will be 'worth it' so long as I fully embrace my passion for music as the foundation of who I am, take things slowly, practice letting go, and live in the moment.\"\n\nTo illusminate the lyrical juxtaposition in the chorus hook \"I'm an astronaut, but I'm lost at sea,\" Sless appears as an astronaut lost in the middle of a never-ending sea, with nothing to look at but the outstretching abyss and the sorely missed stars above. Filming was done at Seal Beach, CA and the waterway entrance to Marina del Rey, on the rocky south jetty.\n\nThe music video debuts as acclaim continues to mount for the transplanted Jersey Shore native (by way of Baltimore) as the media discovers and embraces California Dream. NPR's Lakeshore Public Radio show, Midwest Beat with Tom Lounges, during a featured interview session, called California Dream \"one of the best debut albums I've heard in a long time, and certainly one of the best I've gotten to hear this year.\"United Stations Radio Network is currently hosting a pair of Sless quarantine video performances on its YouTube channel that have combined for over 8,000 views in their first week, with an exclusive interview with Sless for The Record podcast coming soon.\n\nAmericana Highways hailed California Dream for its \"wealth of good musical touches [with] style & a commercial charm that's not too sweet,\" adding that the \"superb rollicking\" guitar-driven track \"Gimme the Breeze\" - also featured in the Los Angeles Post-Examiner and Baltimore Post-Examiner - is \"worth the price of the CD\" alone. That rock-fueled energy, the review continues, is beautifully countered by the \"sweet and dynamic\" cut \"Too Much On My Mind,\" a looping, Grateful Dead-like, exploration of a musical theme driven by the pedal steel of - no relation - Barry Sless (Phil Lesh, Chris Robinson) with \"excellent lyrical imagery.\"\n\nMidwest Record joyously noted \"it's always a treat to stumble across a singer/songwriter that knows how to make sensitive, personal songs without stooping to bleeding gums music,\" adding that Sless \"captures the wanderlust\" in creating an album that's \"a dandy ear opener throughout.\"\n\nSless likewise earned high marks from New Jersey Stage (\"refreshingly honest\"), Short and Sweet LA/NYC (\"a songwriter not to be deterred\" with \"an insidious way\" of \"getting our feet tapping while he delivers lyrics of substance\"), and Exclusive Magazine (\"[he] immediately gets our attention, and as we progress, his musical messages carry us along on his rich journey\").\n\nCo-produced with John Bottrell (Christina Perri, Mike Posner) and recorded live in the studio at comp-ny in Glendale, CA, California Dream carries us along Sless's soulful ride down the winding roads of life and love with a vibe that alternates between the celebratory country rock of Luke Combs, the nod-and-a-wink humor of Sturgill Simpson, and the rough-hewn folksiness of Donovan Woods. Through canny lyrics and infectious tunes, California Dream captures Sless's love of LA, the highs and lows of his decision to move there from the Baltimore area after college, and his struggles to embrace the past and push forward. Like Steve Earle, Sless displays bracing honesty in his songwriting, and like Jason Isbell, has a knack for creating a world in which our souls struggle to define themselves. With ceaseless creativity, Sless possesses an ear for the just-right melody and lyric, and a passion for songs that evoke his disappointments, hopes, joys, and loves.\n\nGenre: Americana\n\nRIYL: Luke Combs, Sturgill Simpson, Donovan Woods, Jason Isbell, Steve Earle, Darius Rucker, Ron Sexsmith\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nONE WORLD HISTORIC CHARITY ANTHEM FOR GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE DEBUTS IN BILLBOARD TOP 30 AMID HEAVY SUPERSTAR TRAFFIC\n\n'Truly Global' Collaboration Enters Billboard Mainstream Adult Contemporary Chart at No. 30 with a Bullet in Crowded Field that Includes Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Tim McGraw, Bon Jovi, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Jonas Brothers, Kelly Clarkson, Maroon 5\n\n'Voices 4 One World' Chorus of Grammy Winners and Multi-Grammy Nominees Perform in Historic Alliance to Support Musicians Foundation, The Actors Fund, First Responders Children's Foundation and NAACP Legal Defense Fund\n\nDonate NOW and Watch the Music Video at www.oneworldoursong.com\n\n\"With entertainers out of work, first responders overworked and racial unrest around the country, Franke Previte wants to remind us we are all the same voices existing in \"One World.'\"\n\n- American Songwriter\n\nNEW YORK (Aug. 5, 2020) - ONE WORLD, the timely and historic new \"truly global\" charity anthem for the global pandemic - supporting musicians, actors and first responder families while changing America's racial narrative - officially enters the Billboard charts today, bulleting its way into a Top 30 superstar traffic jam that includes Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Tim McGraw, Bon Jovi, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, Kelly Clarkson, Maroon 5, and.\n\nThe new \"We Are the World\" style multi-vocalist track arrives in Billboard's Mainstream Adult Contemporary chart at No. 30 with a bullet, just one week after \"Ambassador of Soul\" Ellis Hall, one of the song's primary \"Voices 4 One World,\" performed ONE WORLD for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) during the first-ever \"live virtual music concert\" under the Artists UNited Against Human Trafficking initiative.\n\nThis extraordinary new recording, featuring an unprecedented chorus of Grammy Award winners and multiple Grammy nominees, is being offered NOW as a free download with any donation to the major charity beneficiaries, exclusively through www.oneworldoursong.com.

They do have too much power...over artists. \"SAVING BERNIE is simply a silly political comedy that takes place in an alternative universe.\"\n\n- Linda Chorney, award-winning filmmaker\n\n****AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEWS***\n\nTUCSON, AZ (July 29, 2020) - Today's Congressional hearings over the business practices of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple offers hope for an independent filmmaker whose farcical political comedy series, SAVING BERNIE, was blocked by Amazon earlier this year.\n\n\"Amazon censored my Political Comedy by blocking it from being published during an election year,\" says Linda Chorney, the award-winning independent filmmaker and trailblazing Grammy nominee who filmed the globe-trotting political-comedy-travel-adventure series across five continents. \"I can understand why Congress is questioning Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. They do have too much power...over artists.\"\n\nChorney received a letter March 30 from Amazon stating the big tech company is \"taking more time to calibrate on political content during the election year\" in refusing to carry the series. Instead, Chorney was forced to shift her series to Vimeo, which does not have the distribution advantages that Amazon offers. The complete series is now available on Vimeo at www.savingbernie.com.\n\n\"There is a distinct difference between 'Fake News' and 'Satire,'\" Chorney continues. \"SAVING BERNIE is simply a silly political comedy that takes place in an alternative universe, where 'The President' has Senator Sanders kidnapped and shrunken to toy size, so he is no longer a threat to the President's re-election; and singer-songwriter/Bernie fan Linda Chorney's mission is to rescue him, get him unshrunk, and back to the U.S. to help Joe Biden win and save the world from another four years of 'The President'.\"\n\nChorney's previous experience with Amazon as a filmmaker has been positive - and not political. Her award-winning 2019 autobiographical film, When I Sing, is available on the site. That's why she went back to Amazon to host SAVING BERNIE in the first place.\n\n\"It's hard enough making a living as an artist without Coronavirus, and now that it's destroyed many artists' livelihoods, we are just trying to survive. Having Amazon censor our art, just makes things that much harder,\" says Chorney. \"Why would Amazon do that?\"\n\nSAVING BERNIE was filmed on five continents and described as \"Pee Wee Herman meets Austin Powers, Indiana Jones, The Three Stooges and Mel Brooks.\" Hailed by Tucson Weekly as \"far-fetched and ridiculous - albeit funny,\" the series imagines what really happened when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was off the grid during his heart attack recovery. In SAVING BERNIE, Sanders is kidnapped and shrunken to toy size by a mad Russian scientist. But who's behind the diabolical plot? It's up to the fearless \"sorta secret agent\" singer-songwriter to find out, defeat the bad guys, \"save Bernie,\" and get him to use her song in his 2020 presidential bid. Follow Chorney and Sanders together on their ridiculous journey as they get chased around the world, trying to get back home to save the planet!\n\nSAVING BERNIE premiered within days of the global pandemic reaching alarming new heights and sending Americans back to their homes or to rapidly overcrowding hospitals while the economy was screeching toward a standstill.\n\n(**MEDIA promo code available upon request**).\n\nChorney immersed herself in SAVING BERNIE to save herself from the insanity of the current Administration. Now that the insanity has mushroomed as part of a worldwide pandemic.\n\nChorney hopes her fellow creative types can pull together to make these difficult times go down just a little bit easier.\n\n\"Or at least,\" she says, \"we can die laughing.\"\n\nJuly 10, 2020\n\nRISING AMERICANA ARTIST TOM SLESS RELEASES LYRIC VIDEO FOR 'TAKING ME BACK' AMID HIGH PRAISE FOR 'ASSURANCE, CRAFT AND CONVICTION' ON 'UPLIFTING' DEBUT ALBUM, 'CALIFORNIA DREAM'\n\nCalifornia Dream surveys Sless's soulful ride down the winding roads of life and love from Jersey Shore and Baltimore roots to Los Angeles with celebratory country rock, nod-and-a-wink humor, and rough-hewn folksiness.\n\nFirst Post-Quarantine Live Show: Thursday, July 16 in Return to Jersey Shore Roots\n\n\"[California Dream's] assurance, craft and conviction belie the fact that [Tom]'s a novice or a newcomer of any kind. ... Great stuff indeed.\" - American Songwriter\n\nLOS ANGELES (July 10, 2020) - As acclaim mounts while the media continues to discover and embrace his new debut album, California Dream, LA based Americana singer-songwriter-guitar slinger TOM SLESS has released a new lyric video for \"Taking Me Back,\" the rollicking country rock track that delivers the good-time vibe of a Luke Combs song.\n\nThe music video debuts just as Sless returns East to perform his first live show since quarantine hit. He's headed to his Jersey Shore roots for a live show Thursday, July 16 at the Water Dog Smoke House in Ventnor, NJ.\n\nSless produced and directed the video, working with animators/editors Zach Alicaway and Davis Burns to embody that song's go-for-a-drive-and-don't-come-back theme. They used sights of the roads of LA and the classic California VW van driving along the coastal highways, sometimes stopping to reflect while taking in the surroundings, but not long enough to stop moving on a journey to a new beginning.\n\n\"These same roads in LA motivated me as I was processing similar emotions to those described in the song,\" says Sless. \"With the animation style, I wanted to capture the uncertain buoyancy I've felt after leaving a negative experience behind. The words bounce along with the beat of the song, and fade into the background just as the sorrow of the present melts into the past.\"\n\n\"Taking Me Back\" rides along a scampering pedal steel guitar as the singer declares \"I don't want to be alone tonight/but I can't stay here with you/It hasn't been easy to swallow all that truth/It hasn't been easy taking me back from you.\" The sunny sound of the song belies its emotional complexity. \"Although we may want to divorce ourselves from who we once were as we chart a new path,\" says Sless, \"the people we are today is permanently colored by the experiences we've had in the past.\" Yet, like the acoustic guitar that drives the song, we all keep chugging along, even as we \"swallow all that truth.\"\n\nReleased just as the COVID-19 pandemic in late March forced postponement of live Album Release events at home in Los Angeles and plans to tour across the country, California Dream received high praise from American Songwriter as an \"uplifting\" work that is \"Great stuff, indeed,\" offering an \"assurance, craft and conviction\" that belie Sless's status as \"a novice or a newcomer of any kind.\" The song \"Astronaut,\" the magazine continues, \"asks the question, 'Will anyone remember me?' Based on the evidence offered here, the answer is an emphatic yes indeed.\"\n\nAmericana Highways hailed California Dream for its \"wealth of good musical touches [with] style & a commercial charm that's not too sweet,\" adding that the \"superb rollicking\" guitar-driven track \"Gimme the Breeze\" - also featured in the Los Angeles Post-Examiner and Baltimore Post-Examiner - is \"worth the price of the CD\" alone. That rock-fueled energy, the review continues, is beautifully countered by the \"sweet and dynamic\" cut \"Too Much On My Mind,\" a looping, Grateful Dead-like, exploration of a musical theme driven by the pedal steel of - no relation - Barry Sless (Phil Lesh, Chris Robinson) with \"excellent lyrical imagery.\"\n\nMidwest Record joyously noted \"it's always a treat to stumble across a singer/songwriter that knows how to make sensitive, personal songs without stooping to bleeding gums music,\" adding that Sless \"captures the wanderlust\" in creating an album that's \"a dandy ear opener throughout.\"\n\nSless likewise earned high marks from New Jersey Stage (\"refreshingly honest\"), Short and Sweet LA/NYC (\"a songwriter not to be deterred\" with \"an insidious way\" of \"getting our feet tapping while he delivers lyrics of substance\"), and Exclusive Magazine (\"[he] immediately gets our attention, and as we progress, his musical messages carry us along on his rich journey\"). United Stations Radio Network, American Songwriter, and Lakeshore Public Radio are among others planning coverage.\n\nCo-produced by the Jersey Shore native with John Bottrell (Christina Perri, Mike Posner) and recorded live in the studio at comp-ny in Glendale, CA, California Dream carries us along Sless's soulful ride down the winding roads of life and love with a vibe that alternates between the celebratory country rock of Luke Combs, the nod-and-a-wink humor of Sturgill Simpson, and the rough-hewn folksiness of Donovan Woods. Through canny lyrics and infectious tunes, California Dream capturesSless's love of LA, the highs and lows of his decision to move there from the Baltimore area after college, and his struggles to embrace the past and push forward. Like Steve Earle, Sless displays bracing honesty in his songwriting, and like Jason Isbell, has a knack for creating a world in which our souls struggle to define themselves. With ceaseless creativity, Sless possesses an ear for the just-right melody and lyric, and a passion for songs that evoke his disappointments, hopes, joys, and loves.\n\nGenre: Americana\n\nRIYL: Luke Combs, Sturgill Simpson, Donovan Woods, Jason Isbell, Steve Earle, Darius Rucker\n\nJuly 6, 2020\n\nPHILADELPHIA INTERNATIONAL RECORDS CO-FOUNDERS AND LEGENDARY PRODUCERS KENNETH GAMBLE & LEON HUFF MOURN THE LOSS OF SHARON PAIGE OF HAROLD MELVIN & THE BLUE NOTES\n\nCredit: Gamble Huff Entertainment\n\nFeatured Vocalist on #1 R&B hit, \"Hope That We Can Be Together Soon\" Recalled as \"Smooth and Talented\" by Sound of Philadelphia Architects\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Legendary Philadelphia International Records co-founders and R&B pioneers Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff released the following joint statement today as they mourned the passing this weekend of Sharon Paige of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, best known for her duet performance with Teddy Pendergrass on the #1 R&B smash, \"Hope That We Can Be Together Soon\":\n\n\"Sharon possessed one of the most unique female vocals that blended perfectly with the smooth singing and vocal prowess of Harold Melvin and Teddy Pendergrass. We really enjoyed recording Sharon with the group and felt she was a great asset, both for the successful launch of the act and for being a great talent in her own right. She will always be remembered as Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes (featuring the lovely Ms. Sharon Paige). We send our sincere condolences to her family and fans.\"\n\nSharon Paige came to fame as a singer who worked with Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, particularly on the memorable 1975 ballad, \"I Hope That We Can Be Together Soon,\" the group's fourth #1 R&B hit. While not a permanent member of the group, Paige was a frequent collaborator who took on a larger role after the departure of Teddy Pendergrass. By the time that song hit the top of the R&B charts, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes had become soul music royalty, on par with the PIR label mates the O'Jays and the Stylistics. Beyond \"Hope That We Can Be Together Soon,\" Paige's smooth tones helped boost other Gamble & Huff compositions for Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes such as \"You Know How To Make Me Feel So Good,\" \"I'm Searching For A Love,\" and \"I Should Be Your Lover.\" She took a more prominent role on the 1980 Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes long-player The Blue Album, but it barely charted. Paige also released a few solo songs, including the beautiful \"You Don't Even Know My Name.\"\n\nJuly 2, 2020\n\nNATIONAL RESTORATION DISINFECTS BATTLESHIP NEW JERSEY FOR FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND REOPENING\n\nLeader in Helping Flatten the Curve is Honored to Deliver FREE Service to Nation's Most Decorated Battleship During Remarkable Moment in U.S. History\n\nCAMDEN, NJ (July 2, 2020) - In preparation to for today's formal re-opening to the public and welcome Fourth of July weekend visitors, the Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial, located on the Camden Waterfront, NJ, opened its interior tour spaces to an important group - the crew of NATIONAL RESTORATION.\n\nYesterday, NATIONAL RESTORATION proudly donated its services to disinfect the interior of our nation's most decorated battleship, covering 30,000 square feet over a three-hour period.\n\n\"We're honored to disinfect the Battleship New Jersey,\" said NATIONAL RESTORATION president John Marroni, who was recently quoted by Business Insider in four separate stories as a disinfection expert. \"During this remarkable time in our country's history, I can't think of a better way to give back.\"\n\nThe regional leader in helping flatten the curve in the spread of COVID-19, National Restoration launched its Coronavirus Disinfection division in March with an expert team that has been dispatched to aid First Responders, hospitals, low income family housing, homeless shelters, daycare centers and houses of worship with its services.\n\nThe Battleship New Jersey, which opened the Hit the Deck exterior self-guided tour on June 15, officially opened its interior spaces this morning. Thanks to NATIONAL RESTORATION's disinfection efforts, guests are now safely experiencing the Combat Engagement Center, the Navigation Bridge, Adm.

These interior spaces, along with the exterior highlights of the 16-inch gun turret, the tomahawk missile launch boxes, and more, make up the full Fire Power self-guided tour of our nation's most decorated and largest Battleship.\n\nTo make it safe for guests to tour the interior of the Battleship, crews from NATIONAL RESTORATION cleaned and disinfected the interior spaces along the tour route through its specialized cleaning method utilizing the NOROxyCdiff™ chemical additive. The EPA registered disinfectant, which also meets CDC recommendations, is a non-corrosive, non-toxic preventative and active killer for numerous viruses that kills Coronavirus in less than 30 seconds.

It's one of many original Grushecky compositions he has performed live over the years with his longtime friend and collaborator, Bruce Springsteen.\n\nGrushecky's well-known relationship with Springsteen was actually forged during the Manhattan recording sessions for Have a Good Time (But Get Out Alive). Longtime Springsteen sidekick Steven Van Zandt, one of the original producers, was simultaneously recording The River with The Boss at the Power Station nearby, and invited Grushecky to one of the sessions to make an introduction to a relationship that has endured for 40 years.\n\nVan Zandt was one-third of a holy trinity of rock and roll royalty united to help oversee the original recording of Have a Good Time (But Get Out Alive), along with Mick Ronson (David Bowie) and Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople). Together, they combined with co-producers the Slimmer Twins (Steve Popovich Sr. & Marty Mooney) and the Iron City Houserockers to create one of rock's great lost classics. Their cohesive efforts - as producers, arrangers and players - are finally being rediscovered as an entirely new listening experience on digital, CD and vinyl through fabled indie label, Cleveland International Records. The remastered two-CD set includes a bonus disc with 16 previously unreleased tracks of demos and other rarities. The new vinyl edition contains a download card of those same 16 tracks to go with a vinyl replica of the original album. The digital package is on sale NOW and streaming here. Order the vinyl and physical CD here. Order the exclusive Iron City Houserockers Bundle Pack at www.clevelandinternational.com.\n\nThe presence of Hunter, Ronson and Van Zandt, says the Houston Press, sets \"this project apart,\" and \"gives the whole record a sort of Pittsburgh/New Jersey/London amalgamation vibe.\" MediaNews Group called this chapter in Grushecky's four-decade career \"one of his shining moments.\"\n\nPaste Magazine, in the latest \"Record Time\" vinyl column, says listening to the vinyl reissue \"the future sound of other American outfits like The Hold Steady and Drive-By Truckers is evident, as is the sound of groups like Graham Parker and the Rumour, which was mining similar musical territory at the same time as the [Iron City] Houserockers. This 40th anniversary edition is a simple recreation of the original release, with much improved sound.\"\n\nLittle Steven's Underground Garage celebrated Digital Release Day with a \"Coolest Conversations\" album spotlight, as Grushecky spoke with the Mighty Manfred on Sirius XM. Ultimate Classic Rock hosted an exclusive Track Premiere of the bonus disc demo version of \"Hypnotized (A Work in Progress),\" featuring Hunter and Ronson, and called the new release \"cool stuff.\"\n\nAmerican Songwriter, in an interview with Grushecky, hails Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive) as \"a forgotten gem of a record, a time capsule of frenetic '80s energy and lyrics about home that hit home, performed by the toughest, tightest band from the 'work hard, play hard' working-class streets of Pittsburgh.\" The magazine adds that the bonus disc not only \"documents each song's evolution,\" but \"showcases how Grushecky and the band took it up a notch when the 'record' button was pressed.\"\n\nGoldmine, in a new five-star review, proclaims the album an \"epic musical milestone,\" and placed it in the context of the current world pandemic, noting the how \"few bands offered up material as gritty, rich, and poignant as Pittsburgh's own The Iron City Houserockers\" and the \"modern-day relevance to the message of the title track and the album itself. Get Out Alive! has always been a record of hope, home, solidarity, community, strength, and love - themes that are as important today as they were 40 years ago.\"\n\nGenre: Heartland Rock, Blues Rock, Classic Rock\n\nRIYL: Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, John Mellencamp, David Bowie, Southside Johnny, J.

The label's first single release was \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" by Ronnie Spector and The E Street Band. Shortly thereafter, the label signed an unknown singer named Meat Loaf and launched the album, \"Bat Out of Hell\" en route to becoming one of the top selling albums in the history of the music industry. The label and its catalog combined to make Cleveland International Records one of the first independent record companies whose catalogue has sold in excess of over 50 million albums worldwide. The label relaunched in 2019, with Popovich's son, Steve Jr., at the helm, and a rekindled commitment to bring both new and generational music back to the forefront.

Cotton joins a stellar line-up of performers that includes headliner Corey Taylor alongside Gavin Rossdale, George Thorogood, Don Felder (formerly of The Eagles), Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge), Lzzy Hale & Joe Hottinger (Halestorm), Jesse Hasek (10 Years), Filter, Lisa Loeb, The Dead Daisies, Chris Robertson (Black Stone Cherry), Starset, Brandon Saller (Atreyu), Ricky Byrd, Bobby Whitlock & CoCo Carmel, Joe Grushecky, Kathy Sledge, Bones Owens, BJ Thomas, Matt Bigland (Dinosaur Pile-Up) and more, with special appearances by Peter Frampton and Adam Gontier of Saint Ansonia.\n\nFeeding America estimates that an additional 17.1 million people could be food insecure in 2020 as a result of this crisis - for a total of 54.3 million people, or 1 in every 6 people. This is a 46% increase over the 37.2 million people who were food insecure prior to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nCotton will be performing an acoustic version, on piano, of \"A Different War,\" the title track from her latest album, which finds the woman whose music is \"soulful enough to fill a revival tent\" (The New York Times) and whose voice gives her songs \"stunning power\" (No Depression) speaking to these extraordinary times by unloading her sin while the world around her is gripped in a turbulent spin.\n\nShe will be joined for this special live performance by prominent Bronx hip-hop artist Mickey Factz, reprising his guest appearance on the original album track. \"A Different War\" examines how the reality of people of color getting called into battle as a result of being marginalized informs their entire existence. The song also urges us to press ahead because of the ongoing need for substantive change.\n\nIn a deeply personal and moving editorial she titled \"Fade to Black\" just published by SWAAY.com, Cotton confronts her own upbringing as a biracial woman in a predominantly white upper middle class New Jersey suburb. Read it here.\n\nCotton frames A Different War by confronting race, gender, and wealth - deeply personal and pervasive issues that have plagued folks like her for an eternity.\n\nCalling the album, \"stunning and stirring,\" American Songwriter, which hosted an exclusive premiere of Cotton's music video, \"Cheap High,\" her most recent single, praised A Different War for \"an uncompromising urgency that transforms its songs into anthems for our times.\" Including the album among its Best Bets in \"The Hotness\" Summer Issue, BUST Magazine raved: \"A Different War is an album bursting with soulful blues rock, delivered with steely confidence. ... Whether she's wailing Janis Joplin-style on 'Cheap High' or declaring 'I was not born a man, but I can do anything that he can,' on 'She Too,' she's in control, and she's our kind of belter.\"\n\nAdding to the praise for A Different War, MediaNews Group syndicate was impressed at how Cotton's \"consistent ability to overcome pain and express it through music shines a light on the issues of the day and shows the world what it's like to continue to fight.\" San Francisco Classical Voice chimed in, saying \"I would really encourage you to take a listen to\" the new album.\n\nThroughout her career, the longtime New Yorker from Hopewell, NJ, has drawn praise from the New York Times, Billboard, the Los Angeles Times, NPR, and USA Today, among many others. She continues to inhabit a song, turning it inside and out to create transcendent music and lyrics, and carry us higher and higher with her in her musical flights.\n\nA Different War finds the gutsy New Yorker swimming through the tumultuous social issues of racism and greed, and the tempestuous waters of love and relationships. These are songs deeply rooted in the protest anthems of yesterday but built for the current state of our world. A multi-racial, gospel-fueled, Jewish blues-rocker who believes in the power of womanhood, Cotton grew up in a predominantly white New Jersey community as one of just seven black kids in her high school. She has survived cancer and the tragic loss of twins at birth, only to bounce back and finally welcome a daughter in 2018. Cotton's consistent ability to overcome pain and express it through music shines a light on the issues of the day and shows the world what it's like to fight \"A Different War.\"\n\nA Different War is a true collaboration with some of the most talented musicians and technicians in the business. From Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne, Edie Brickell) on drums, Ben Butler (Sting, George Michael, Chris Botti) on guitar, and Andy Hess (Gov't Mule, Black Crowes) on bass, to young gun guitarist Emmanuel Rossillo working his first major studio project, the record resonates with innovation and flare. The finishing touches of the brilliant mix provided by Dave O'Donnell (James Taylor, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer) and the mastering of Greg Calbi (numerous hits over the past 20 years) make this record a true meeting of the best of the best.\n\nThe evidence is clear on A Different War that DANIELIA COTTON continues to evolve and challenge herself as a musician. Fifteen years since her breakout as an Artist to Watch by influential Philadelphia public radio outlet WXPN, Cotton remains a true indie artist fighting for independence - the space to create her own sound and an audience that would journey with her.\n\nAvailable NOW at Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon, and where music is consumed on-line.\n\nGenre: Rock, Soul, Blues\n\nRIYL: Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Wonder, Bonnie Raitt, Janis Joplin, Rolling Stones, Black Crowes, Donny Hathaway, Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nJune 23, 2020\n\nOSCAR-WINNING COMPOSER REUNITES AMERICAN-SOVIET SONGWRITING TEAM TO RELEASE \"ONE WORLD\" CHARITY ANTHEM FOR GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE\n\nAvailable THURSDAY, June 25 on Spotify, Apple Music, and iTunes\n\nHistoric Collaboration Reborn to Support Musicians Foundation, The Actors Fund, First Responders Children's Foundation and NAACP Legal Defense Fund\n\n'Voices 4 One World' Recording Participants Include Multiple Grammy Winners and Nominees\n\nDonate NOW at www.oneworldoursong.com\n\n\"With entertainers out of work, first responders overworked and racial unrest around the country, Franke Previte wants to remind us we are all the same voices existing in 'One World.'\" - American Songwriter\n\nNEW YORK (June 23, 2020) - ONE WORLD, a timely new anthem for the global pandemic reuniting a pair of prominent American songwriters with a pair of leading Soviet songwriters for the unified purpose of helping musicians, singers and actors whose incomes have been cut off by Coronavirus quarantining; supporting first responder families enduring COVID-19-related financial hardship, and changing the narrative about race in America - will be officially available for digital distribution THURSDAY (June 25) on Spotify, Apple Music, and iTunes. This extraordinary collaboration, featuring an unprecedented chorus of Grammy Award winners and multiple Grammy nominees, is being offered NOW as a free download with any donation to the major charity partner beneficiaries, exclusively through www.oneworldoursong.com.\n\nThe four major charity partners are: Musicians Foundation, The Actors Fund, as well as First Responders Children's Foundation, beneficiary of the recent \"Living Room Concert for America\" hosted on FOX by Elton John, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nOscar-winning songwriter Franke Previte (\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" from Dirty Dancing) was spurred by the global pandemic to enlist ONE WORLD co-writer Pamela Phillips Oland (Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin) and together create an entirely new recording of their historic 1989 collaboration with updated lyrics, freshly retooled for the sole purpose of giving 100% of all proceeds from downloads to the four major charity partners.\n\nAmerican Songwriter calls the new version of ONE WORLD \"a hopeful song of unity that recalls some of the '80s most anthemic message songs, led by powerful vocal performances from an ensemble of well-respected, top-notch singers.\"\n\nThe ONE WORLD official website is accepting easy donations of any amount, which entitle a donor to a free instant download of the song ONE WORLD. (Please note: Downloads for NAACP Legal Defense Fund donations are not yet available.)\n\nONE WORLD made its world radio premiere earlier this month when Entercom offered a sneak peek to global listeners during the Bob Pantano Saturday Night Dance Party, heard around the world (and nationally to Comcast subscribers) through the Radio.com app, and throughout the Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey region on five radio stations, anchored by flagship 98.1 WOGL. Pantano has committed to continue playing ONE WORLD on all future broadcasts.\n\nA growing gallery of notable musicians and actors are recording PSAs for the ONE WORLD \"Celebrity Circle\" on an ongoing basis. Early contributors include two-time Tony Award winner Christine Ebersole, legendary \"Sound of Philadelphia\" architect Kenny Gamble, Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres, Emmy Award nominee Michele Greene (\"L.A. Law\"), original teen idol Bobby Rydell, actress-comedian Siobhan Fallon (\"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Seinfeld,\" \"Men in Black\"), Vocal Group Hall of Famer Kenny Vance (Jay & The Americans, Kenny Vance & The Planotones), Grammy nominated songwriter Rob Hyman (\"Time After Time\") of The Hooters (Philadelphia Music Walk of Fame) and beloved blue collar rocker and Bruce Springsteen collaborator Joe Grushecky.\n\nThe range of charities reflects the scope and breadth of the pandemic's devastating impact on the community. All live music-related performances: touring, concert, theatrical, Broadway, TV, film - have ground to a halt. Musicians and singers are unable to earn a living in front of live audiences. The touring infrastructure - crews, road managers, talent buying, concert promotion - has been left in disarray, with no true sense of normalcy projected to be returning for another year at least.\n\nONE WORLD was written in Moscow by Previte and Oland with two Estonian songwriters, Sergei Manoukyan and Mikk Targo, during the 1989 Glasnost event \"Music Speaks Louder Than Words,\" the first ever Arts Exchange between Soviet and American songwriters, organized by Alan Roy Scott and Music Bridges. Previte and Oland were among the 22 renowned songwriters participating from the USA. Other notable participants included Diane Warren, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Bolton, Brill Building legends Mike Stoller and Barry Mann, Desmond Child (Bon Jovi), Brenda Russell (Earth Wind & Fire, Donna Summer, Rufus), songwriting team Billy Steinberg & Tom Kelly (Madonna, Whitney Houston), Franne Golde (Jody Watley, Commodores), and Alan Roy Scott (Motown, Celine Dion, Cher).\n\nThe ensuing album included the original recording of ONE WORLD by Earth Wind & Fire. The lyrics in the new recording have been lovingly updated to address the current COVID-19 crisis and, says Previte, \"give hope to all mankind for us to dream again.\" Every creative participant is an \"UnSung Hero\" to the global music community who has collaborated with superstars across many genres. Collectively known as Voices 4 One World, all have contributed to the greatness of recorded and live music as musicians and background singers, many of whom are Grammy Award winners and multiple Grammy nominees.\n\n\"These musicians and singers are the backbone of the music industry, who have made the stars of yesterday and today household names,\" says Previte. \"This is our heartfelt way of saying thank you and giving them some of the recognition they so rightfully deserve.\"\n\nSingers on the record are: Michael Mayo (Josh Groban, Herbie Hancock), Ronee Martin (Patti LaBelle, Wynton Marsalis), Tower of Power \"Ambassador of Soul\" Ellis Hall, Dorian Holley (Michael Jackson, Rod Stewart), Grammy winner Judith Glory Hill (Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Prince), Valerie Pinkston (Lenny Kravitz, Luther Vandross, Annie Lennox), Amy Keys (Herbie Hancock, Sting, Barbra Streisand), Christine Collister (Richard Thompson Band), and Lisa Sherman (Jon Bon Jovi, Blondie). Musicians are Jon Gilutin (James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt) keyboards; Lenny Castro (Toto), percussion; Brendan Buckley (Shakira, Perry Farrell), drums; Scott Mayo (Earth Wind & Fire), saxophone; Jerry Watts Jr. (Andraé Crouch, Dr. John), bass; James Harrah (Melissa Etheridge, Leonard Cohen), guitar; Randy Jacobs (Was Not Was), guitar; and Tollack Ollestad (Don Henley, Andrea Boccelli), harmonica.\n\nONE WORLD was produced by Grammy winner Jon Gilutin (\"New Attitude\") and mixed by Grammy, Emmy and Dove Award-winning engineer Bill Schnee (Steely Dan, Natalie Cole). The video was produced by Thomas Ryan Ward.\n\nThe participants in the ONE WORLD project profusely thank and honor the First Responders, and the sacrifices they and their families, including their children, are making to help all of us.\n\n\"These 'UnSung Heroes' of music have donated their time and talents so that our song can help make our world a better one to live in,\" adds Previte. \"You know their music, now you know their names! Give them all a heartfelt 'Thank you' as they help us to heal others.\"\n\nPHOTO CAPTION (LEFT): Composite photo of the five lead singers of \"One World,\" Ellis Hall (center), and clockwise from top left, Michael Mayo, Judith Glory Hill, Dorian Holley, and Ronee Martin.

Their cohesive efforts - as producers, arrangers and players - will finally be rediscovered as an entirely new listening experience on CD and vinyl when Have a Good Time (But Get Out Alive) is released by fabled indie label, Cleveland International Records.
