        "text": "Blues Cures Studio Jam Vol. 13 CD\n\n[Sean's Notes] [Dedications] [John Brozovich & Larisa Akruzhnou Dedication] [Song Credits] [Thanks To] [Pictures]\n\nFeaturing\n\nInternational Blues Challenge Champions Sean Carney, Nick Schnebelen Band, Bart Walker and Noah Wotherspoon, along with the Matt O’Ree Band, Scotty Bratcher, Jamie Peck, Matt Salvo, Lenny Fatigati, Jason Edwards.\n\nAudio Samples\n\nSONG LIST\n\n(Click link to listen to MP3 sample)\n\nPanther Pants Stomp\n\nStill Wanna Be Your Man\n\nLeave Your Hat On\n\nLove Her With A Feeling\n\nTriple Whammy\n\nRollinâ Stone (Catfish Blues)\n\nYouâre Gonna Stumble\n\nAinât No Sunshine\n\nZDD\n\nIâm Tired\n\nGoinâ To Mississippi\n\nCaribbean Moon\n\nWabash In The Foxhole\n\nStop Dragginâ My Heart Around\n\nSean's Notes\n\nNot even the chaos of 2021 could throw Blues For A Cure off track and we are incredibly proud to present the thirteenth volume of our Studio Jam Series, bringing never before heard combinations of world-class musicians jamming together for the very special purpose of battling cancer.\n\nSome exciting connections have occurred at and through Blues For A Cure. One of those magical encounters happened when Mark Puskarich introduced Scotty Bratcher to Bart Walker, ensuing a red hot jam that led to the formation of The Desert City Ramblers, and I’m pleased to report, this very recording! I’m happy that we were finally able to get Scotty Bratcher onto one of these sessions, especially considering the fact that he appeared at our second ever event back in 2009, alongside the immortal Hubert Sumlin.\n\nMatt O’Ree and his band have also been around BFAC since our second ever recording session and it’s been a pleasure to hear their sound evolve over the decade we’ve been working together. The addition of stellar vocalist Eryn O’Ree continues to pay incredible dividends as she brings new life to the favorite “Leave Your Hat On,\" and she’ll certainly have plenty of imaginations working over time with this sultry reading. Matt’s amazing, unique and ultra soulful guitar work has caught the attention of people like Jon Bon Jovi as he continues to travel the country increasing his audience.\n\nOhio born and bred Noah Wotherspoon has been a brother in BFAC for nearly a decade as well and his IBC credentials placed him in a well deserved international spotlight that has continued to bring his sound to prestigious venues in Europe and the USA. A guitarist’s guitarist, Noah is a sensitive artist who always explores the less traveled routes to the heart and soul, and he takes the low and dirty road down south on “Going to Mississippi” and ultimately delivers us to the promised land!\n\nI was so excited to be present at The Orpheum Theater in Memphis when Bart Walker and his band won The International Blues Challenge in 2012, and it was even more of a thrill for me to watch my friend on his regular gig, several years later, as guitarist for Hank Williams, Jr. in front of 10,000 people. Bart has used his new connections to secure signed instruments for BFAC from people like ‘Keb ‘Mo and Dolly Parton - Bart’s generosity is as immense as his stunning musical talent.\n\nThe pairing of Bart Walker and Scotty Bratcher is a blues rock one-two-punch full of electricity, dynamics, tension and release, and overall guitar artistry and their camaraderie inspires everyone on this session to not only play their very best, but to maybe even take some wild chances.\n\nIt was a long time coming and after several attempts, we were finally able to bring Nick Schnebelen back to Blues For A Cure. Trampled Under Foot swept the 2008 IBC and they were the core of the band on our first three volumes of this series, and eight years later Nick brings his super fine band, Adam HagÂ­erman on drums and Cliff Moore on bass.\n\nLenny Paul returns with rock solid bass work that we’ve come to love and rely on, as well as a memorable original tune with an inspired vocal.\n\nTony’s Treasures, with producer Mark Puskarich and engineer Cody Romshak at the helm, has hosted this series for a decade now (with the first three volumes recorded at Central City in Columbus). The studio is a comfortable home away from home for all of us musicians who we’ve come to appreciate as a sort of “fantasy camp” where we can truly disconnect with the distractions of city life to immerse ourselves in the music in a first class recording studio with all of the modern comforts and the latest recording technology.\n\nThe last year has been a difficult one for many of us in many ways and sadly cancer took a number of long time friends and supporters of Blues For A Cure. With the memories of those we cherish on our minds, we present this music from our hearts in hopes that it might ease what ails or inspire in some way, or just make you tap your foot.\n\nSean Carney\n\n[Top]\n\nDedications\n\n“The Ohio Blues community lost a beloved behind the scenes leader when Helen Maude Holt passed away in early May 2022. I’ve known Helen since the ’90s through her leadership and volunteer work with The Marietta Blues, Jazz & Folk Music Society and their legendary events at the historic Lafayette Hotel. Helen was a natural born hostess and just knew how to make everyone feel perfectly at home - she could charm and disarm and wasn’t afraid to let you know that she was really a West Virginia Wild Woman at heart! I’ll save those details for in person stories.Â Helen was a talented educator, dedicated mother, grandmother, friend, blues lover and a fierce supporter of worker’s rights. Helen made a difference and she will be deeply missed by many.” â Sean Carney\n\n“The Blues community reeled with the sad news of the passing of Trampled Under Foot drummer Kris Schnebelen on January 11, 2022. Kris had been battling cancer and will not only be missed by his fans but by his family, as a beloved father, brother, son and so much more. BFAC was truly blessed to have TUF along for several of our early events and the first three volumes of this series and I now cherish those recordings so much more. Kris also joined me on several tracks with Henry Gray and he just propelled those tunes like a machine yet kept Henry’s piano driving the band upfront. Kris listened intently to everyone in the band and always had just the right groove in mind. There is so much more I could say about Kris, but words fail to express the respect and love I have for Kris and his siblings. Kris was a one of a kind and what those three siblings did on stage together was a true gift from God.” â Sean Carney\n\n“I’d like to dedicate my work on this recording to Shakin’ Dave Hussong. Dave recently left us after a battle with cancer. He was a phenomenal guitarist, soulful singer, artist, vintage guitar aficionado, and hosted a blues radio show for 37 years on public radio. I was fortunate to know Dave from an early age and he influenced my life and music in countless ways. I’m forever grateful for his friendship and all the love he shared.” â Noah Wotherspoon\n\n“I would like to dedicate the work of all the players, producers and engineers on this project in memory of my brother John Peck who was an amazing drummer who lost his battle to esophageal cancer. JP, as he was called, played drums for David Ball and Sarah Evans. And to my 25-year colleague B.E. Taylor whose voice is in the heavens after battling brain cancer. B.E. touched thousands of people with his yearly Christmas concerts and albums. I was privileged to share music with both of them.” â Jamie Peck\n\n\"It’s always a pleasure and an honor to be a part of yet another Blues For A Cure CD. What this foundation does for those in need is absolutely incredible. I’d like to take this moment to dedicate our performances to all those fighting through their treatments, may this music pick up your soul and bring a ray of sunshine to your world. We all had a blast making this one and we hope that it helps those in need battling the awful disease of cancer.” - Matt O’Ree\n\n“I would like to dedicate my performance to my grandfather William Shewell whom I never got to meet. Before I was born he passed away from Multiple Myeloma, and even though we never knew each other, he had a tremendous effect on my life and my family.” â Eryn O’Ree\n\n“This year I would like to honor my grandmother, Margaret Elizabeth Poole Walker. She was taken by breast cancer before I was born, while my dad was in the Marine Corps.” â Bart Walker\n\n“I absolutely have to dedicate this project to my amazing 93 year old grandmother, Etta Mae Bratcher, who has always been the toughest human I’ve ever known.Â Breast cancer survivor since she was 79.” â Scotty Bratcher\n\n“We lost our good friend Delores Holmes to this terrible disease in 2010. Dee will always be in our hearts, and we will be forever grateful to her for bringing our band mate and friend Layonne into the world. I’d like to dedicate my performance to Dee.” â Lex Lehman\n\nThe Nick Schnebelen band would like to thank Mark Puskarich, Sean Carney and Cody Romshak for inviting us to be a part of Blues For A Cure. We always have a great time being a part of these sessions and are grateful for the opportunity. We thank everyone on this session that recorded, we really enjoyed the time spent together and productive work. Thank you to our friends and fans, Chris Hardwick our manager, Intrepid Artists International, and everyone else on our team.\n\nNick Schnebelen endorses Category Five Amplification\n\nGuitars used on this recording: 1992 Japanese Fender Telecaster, 1966 Gibson ES-335, 2000 Airline Reissue\n\nCliff Moore endorses Lakland Basses and Gallien-Kruger Bass Amplification\n\nAdam Hagerman proudly endorses Aquarian Drumheads and Vater Drum Sticks, and Kelly SHUâ¢ microphone systems.\n\n[Top]\n\nSong Credits\n\n1.

John was a life long friend who passed from cancer over the summer of 2021. He and his wife Patty had recently moved to New Mexico.Â John was an avid music lover and one of his favorite genres was the Blues.Â He attended many of the Blues For A Cure events over the years and frequently attended Blues concerts in Columbus venues when the right artist was in town.Â In April of 2009, I was fortunate enough to talk John into traveling with me to Vienna and Budapest to catch the Sean Carney Band while they were on tour in Europe.Â What a fun and memorable trip.Â Especially traveling with John, who like me really enjoyed wine, and an occasional cigar.Â The photo displayed here is John, holding a Sean Carney Band CD, while at the club in Budapest, where they were performing along with some great Hungarian Blues bands.Â John was really truly loved by so many people as he was about the nicest and most fun person you would ever meet.Â This one was really hard.Â I miss you John. â Mark Puskarich\n\nLarisa was my son-in-law, Valentin Akruzhnou’s mother.Â She persevered through many years of cancer.Â Larisa was a strong and proud immigrant from Belarus.Â She and her husband, Peter, immigrated with sons Val and Alexi in 1999.Â They settled near Cleveland, Ohio and brought with them a strong work ethic that led to their successful lives in America.Â Larisa obtained a second opinion about her cancer and had valuable ongoing consultations with Dr. David Cohn of The James Cancer Hospital.Â Because of my affiliation with The James, I had conversations with Larisa about how The James might help and who were the best resources to help her.Â The family is very thankful to The James for their support.Â Larisa’s kind, generous and loving soul will be missed by her family and friends. â Mark Puskarich\n\n[Top]\n\nThanks To\n\nA very special thanks to all the artists on this recording who donated their time and efforts.Â We completed a one-day session on June 27, 2021, following the 10th Annual BFAC Harrison County concert. These amazing artists are beautiful people, incredibly talented, and so much fun to record.Â To Cody Romshak, my best friend and recording studio engineer, who has amazing passion and patience in the recording sessions.Â\n\nTo Steve Mack, an integral organizer of Blues For A Cure, supporter of A Christmas To Cure Cancer, excellent photographer and good friend. Â A special thanks to Teri Pealer for being our annual onsite artist liaison, cook and autograph herder. To all who helped organize and pull off Blues For A Cure events in 2021: my wife Irina Puskarich, Claire Zehnal, Cindy Blake, Joe Blake, Scott Smalley, Laura Strickland, and Margarita Crow.Â\n\nTo my mom Lois Puskarich, who makes sure posters and flyers are distributed everywhere in Harrison County. To my sister Lisa, for proofing everything on a minute’s notice and catching all the small things.Â Photographers Dusty Scott and Mark Berger.Â To my cousins Lori and Rich Milleson, for all their support of ACTCC and BFAC Harrison County.Â To all the sponsors, especially Holly Williams and Tina Rush of MPLX Gathering and Processing, Alex Johnson of Midwest Terminals of Toledo, Jackie Stewart of Encino Energy, Milestone Insurance, Ken and Adele Mason, D&J Sales and Service, John and Pauline Jones, and Dan Jones of Â WVU Medicine Harrison County Hospital.\n\nTo Cadiz Mayor John Migliore and Scott Porter of Sally Buffalo Park. To Tammy Mattern and the Lincoln Inn, and Ben St. John of Microtel for providing accommodations for the artists each year.Â Don Sloan and WTOV9 Steubenville for all the PSA support.Â Cindy Taylor from 106.3 The River for radio advertising and PSAs. To the wonderful folks at 10TV: Angela An, Karina Nova and Tracy Townsend, among others, for all the Columbus support. We all work so very hard to help make an impact on cancer research and Keeping The Blues Alive. â Mark Puskarich\n\nTonyâs Treasures Productions is proud to sponsor this recording project to help support fundraising for cancer related causes as well as the Blues Foundation. Itâs always a pleasure and thrill to work with such great artists and witness their enthusiasm for their craft. Thank you for supporting great blues music and two great causes. â Mark Puskarich\n\n[Top]\n\nPictures"
