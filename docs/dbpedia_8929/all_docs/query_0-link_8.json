        "text": "Oct. 27, 2010\n\nComplete Release in PDF Format\n\nOREM, Utah -- The Utah Valley University volleyball team will return to Great West Conference play this weekend by hosting second place South Dakota Thursday (7 p.m.) and conference leading North Dakota Saturday (3 p.m.). All three teams are hot as of late as they have combined to go an impressive 21-3 in the past couple of weeks.\n\nDuring the Wolverines (15-9, 4-2 GWC) hot stretch they have won four in a row and six of their last seven. UVU's lone loss during the stretch was to BYU at home on Oct. 9, in front of the largest volleyball crowd in UVU school history, 2,206. Last week the Wolverines finished up their non-conference slate by hosting Southern Utah and Boise State. After back-to-back victories agaisnt the foes UVU finshed its non-conference record at 11-7.\n\nUVU senior middle blocker Dani Robison was recently named the GWC Defensive Player of the week after she put up 15 blocks last week in the two wins over SUU and BSU.\n\nThe Coyotes will enter play on Thursday with an 8-16 overall record and a 5-2 conference mark. USD has won three consecutive as well as six of its last seven. South Dakota is led offensively by senior outside hitter Kristin Kritenbrink who has a team-high 259 kills. Despite an earlier season loss at USD, UVU leads the all-time series 2-1. The Wolverines have also won the only prior meeting in Orem, as they swept the Coyotes on Oct. 2, 2009.\n\nThe Fighting Sioux will come to Orem with a perfect 7-0 GWC clip and an overall record of 17-5. The defending Great West Champion Sioux are led offensively by their very own version of the \"big three\"; Devin Trefz (275 kills), Annika Smed (226) and Erin Joki (214).\n\nNorth Dakota leads the all-time series against the Wolverines 3-1, which includes a four set victory earlier this year in Grand Forks (25-13, 22-25, 18-25, 21-25). UVU is a perfect 1-0 against UND in Orem however after a thrilling five-set win at home last year.\n\nFollowing this week's matches, UVU will conclude its home schedule by hosting Houston Baptist Nov. 4 and Texas-Pan American Nov. 5, for senior night.\n\nPROMOTIONS:\n\nThursday's match with South Dakota will be Kathleen Stevens' Hometown Hero Night. Fans from California will get in for just $1 and fans from Kat's hometown of Lafayette get in for FREE (show your ID at the ticket table). The first 200 fans will also receive a Kathleen Stevens Hometown Hero poster that she will autograph following the match.\n\nFor Saturday's match against North Dakota, any fan who dresses up in a Halloween Costume will get FREE admission."
