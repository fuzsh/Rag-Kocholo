        "text": "Emily’s Army - Lost at Seventeen (Rise Records)\n\nI was going to review Emily’s Army on its own merit (which I still intend to do,) but first I have to explain a little about the band, namely the drummer Joey Armstrong. He’s the 17 year old son of Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Joey’s got his dad’s snarly, snotty, vocal prowess, and the phrasing to match. Now, before you jump to conclusions, Emily’s Army is NOT a junior Green Day by any means. They have a distinct, natural, and original sound that is as much fun as it is unique! I mean, you can’t help but sit up and take notice of all 16 songs on Seventeen. As a debut album they took apart some old school punk (Clash, Sex Pistols), classic rock (Kinks, Springsteen), and their own musical mojo and put the pieces back together in a jagged collage. Very verse-chord-verse, they base their belief on the idea that most of today’s pop punk is a lethargic dinosaur. Each of Emily’s Army’s songs is a complete, satisfying composition without the extra musical baggage that a lot of today’s bands feel the need to include.\n\nPolitics (“I Am The President,” “War”), love (“Jamie,” “Part Time Burn” “Pathetic and in Love”), and songs about music, especially punk rock (“Kids Just Wanna Dance,” “If Our Music Plays Again”), drugs (“Lost at Seventeen” “Digital Drugs”-actually an anti-drug song) can be at times complex (“Bullets made of bread” has to be one the best lines ever) , both musically and lyrically. Yet you can dance your asses off to each and every song here.\n\nGood music insinuates itself into your ears and up into your brain like a slithering snake, so that you feel sensually alive to the point where your feet start to move. Lost At Seventeen just clubs you over the head into submission. There’s no going back! I dare say it’s been quite a while since a band had such commanding control, and could play so loose. Playing this record could conceivably give you an epileptic seizure of orgasmic dance proportions. How else to explain the inexplicable?\n\nEmily’s Army is evidence that a young band just starting out has the imagination to play music that holds together without having to sacrifice the reason they originally got together and kick out the jams however they what!\n\nWhat I absolutely LOVE about a new, exciting band like Emily’s Army is that after repeated listens, you just cannot fandom life without bands like this. They found the singular joyous essence that only rock ‘n’ roll can provide and provoke. The full-on rush of excitement and bubbling-over ecstasy is instant you drop the needle on this record!\n\nSpringsteen On Springsteen - Interviews, Speeches, and Encounters Edited by Jeff Burger (Chicago Review Press)\n\nAfter reading a lengthy book on Springsteen less than a month ago (Bruce), I wasn’t really looking forward to reading Springsteen On Springsteen. I mean. Over the years I’ve read at least a dozen or so books on Bruce, and even though I’m a big fan, there’s only so much Bruce Juice a person can take after a while. I mean Bruce seems to be just getting his second wind (he’s 62), and making some really cool albums and knocking it out of the park at almost every live show, but somewhere along the way a lot of the stories get rehashed, making for a long, tedious read.\n\nBut on Springsteen On Springsteen as I started reading, an endearing portrait of the artist emerged: caring, responsible, well-versed in those musical heroes who came before him. He loves all the same artists I love. His eloquence in the interview situation is yet another art form and you get to know him…I mean, really know him this time. Coming, as this book does, on the heels of Peter Ames Carlin’s highly recommended and epic Bruce biography, this one was more than pleasant surprise. It was a mini-revelation.\n\nWhen he talks about mixing rhythm ‘n’ blues early on with beat poetry, his early work all comes into focus. How fascinating is it that he complains to reporter after reporter about money (in the mid-seventies)! “We’re at the lowest we’ve ever been right now,” he tells Jerry Gilbert. “Hopefully I’ll be getting some money from Columbia and maybe with David Bowie doing some of the songs that’ll be good.” (Bowie did, indeed, recording “Growin’ Up,” and “It’s Hard to be a Saint in the City.”).\n\nBruce is described early on by numerous reporters as scruffy, skinny and long-haired, wearing clothes that he seems to have been in for days. He stumbles when he walks and he mumbles when he talks. But that’s part of the beauty of Bruce on Bruce. We get to read the first-hand accounts of his humble but intensely interesting beginnings as a musician. “The writing is on the wall,” as they say.\n\nBruce talks about religiously writing down the Top 10 every Wednesday, and admits that he doesn’t consider himself a revolutionary artist like Dylan or Elvis but a “nuts and bolts” artist built for the long haul. He talks of his humble beginnings, watching his father struggle for work, and not feeling a part of the community so, like other musicians, he makes his own in the world…but with a band.\n\nAs for his marathon concerts, he tells Charlie Rose on TV, “I wanted it to be an extreme experience-an experience that wasn’t casual, that pushed all the limits. I wanted people to be brought to someplace and to come out of themselves.”\n\nHis speeches are the best: his 1989 Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction acceptance speech, his keynote address at the 2012 South By Southwest Music Festival (he said that every one of his songs over the years were all different forms of The Animals’ “It’s My Life,” which brought the house down with laughter. He also got to play with Eric Burdon, the lead singer of The Animals at SXSW. His eulogy of Clarence Clemons is as from the heart as any of his songs. He even adds a few funny stories about Clarence and the band.\n\n“I was influenced by so many great musicians that meant such a great, great deal to me and who I can never really repay,” he tells Brian Williams of NBC-TV. “Music is so intensely personal and strikes you on such an emotional level that it leaves you feeling like you owe a great debt to the people that moved you that deeply. And when I see the guys that did that for me-and I’ve had the opportunity of actually meet a lot that did that for me-it’s wonderful feeling.”\n\nAs I said, you really do feel like you know Bruce after you finish this book. This one book that you will have a hard time putting down!\n\nStreetlight Manifesto- The Hands That Thieve (Victory Records)\n\nStreetlight Manifesto is a band that combines the best elements of ska, punk and their own undiluted special brand of rock ‘n’ roll. The full guitar roar that’s backed by a rhythm section with a power drummer, a bass that’s rock steady, and a horn section that sounds like they could back Miles, Motown, or any contemporary ska band. But this impressive band has a sound all its own.-Kind of sounds like I’m describing a new band for the first time, right? Well that’s the feeling you get listening to The Hands That Thieve. This is their sixth album in about as many years, and it sounds as fresh and original as the rest of their catalog. They have a cohesive identity to match their records’ careering sonic ska stew.\n\nLike the rest of the album songs like “The Three of Us,” “Toe to Toe,” and “The Hands That Thieve” all benefit from not using any gimmicky or over-the-top production. What sets these three songs apart is that they combine to make an idealized melting pot of politics, human nature, and some of the best ska this side of the Mississippi! Streetlight Manifesto’s sound is dense, but once you get into them they will as they say, “Free your ass and your mind will follow!” The thing is, unlike a lot of bands that try to shove politics down your throat or make mindless dance music, Streetlight sing about possibilities. Whether they are politics, life, etc., they let you decide for yourself. They also help you navigate those hip joints as though they’re doctors of chiropractic. If they ever decided to cover Slim Harpo’s (cool, early bluesman), “Hip Shake,” you would see a gazillion mosh pits arise anytime it’s played!\n\nAnother thing that sets Streetlight apart is the sinister edge that they add to music. Like The Stooges early twisted punk, or current bands like Reel Big Fish or Big D & The Kids Table manic, hardcore ska sound, Streetlight’s style is a combination of all that and originality. Songs about unity, authority and justice, distinguish them head and should above the run-of-the-mill punk or ska band.\n\nWith a combination of guitar, drums, bass, and horns filling up every nano-second of the album there is never a dull moment. It’s like an onrushing musical storm that would litterly burn out any transistor radio (remember those?). Bottom-heavy to the max, the music and the blistering vocals on The Hands That Thieve create a clear, hardcore, rocksteady barrage that gallops and moshes along in close formation. In other words, buy this record you won’t be disappointed!-Phil Rainone\n\nEryn Shewell (EyrnShewell.com)\n\nEryn Shewell has the brassy allure of a contemporary artist like Imelda May or Joss Stone, and road-tested moxie of Susan Tedesci. She can play it sweet and sexy like on “Fall,” or get down and dirty like on “Suck it Up,” without missing a beat. It’s very much a natural talent rather than a forced one.\n\nEvery song on her self-titled album is catchy with a nod toward bubblegum simplicity, but that’s a very good thing! Underneath all that is an undeniably engaging band that helps to create some of the coolest mojo. Melodic and bouncy, they mix rock strength with pure pop arrangements that will make a lasting impression. There are a few sprightly pop delights like “Boy like You” and “Relax to Sleep,” but the songs undercurrents are very impressionable.\n\n“Afraid of the Dark,” swings the The Camaros (cool girl-fronted retro-swing band), and a The Cherry Poppin’ Daddies mash-up. But what sends this tune over the moon is Eryn’s enlivened vocals.-Maximum mojo! “High School Sweetheart” ( it has a sweet slide guitar riff that is so much fun to listen to), and “Backseat Romance Forecast” both have energy and excitement of 70’s freeform radio that is hard to come by these days without sounding phony or forced.\n\nEryn helped produce and pen most of the album. Sometimes that’s like a disaster waiting to happen, but on her self-titled album the songs are ambitious, melodic, and concise. This is an album chock full of singles as compared to one that may have one or two good songs, and all the rest filler. This is world-class hit making, and is extraordinary uncommercial. A balance that is rarely achieved these days.\n\nEryn Shewell and her band play like anything is possible, especially for anyone who was always on the outside looking in. They’re able to put the sound in their heads on plastic, sounds that weren’t just “Pure Pop for Now People” (a Nick Lowe album title), but pure pop for hit radio-in the most sincere, uncynical and popularly resonating tradition. They are so engaged and inspired; it’s a synthesis in ways that few other bands can consistently sustain. And through all of that, the band maintains a distinctive group identity. It’s only fair to note that many others wet their musical toes in the same exotic waters only after Eryn Shewell and her band set the precedent. Moreover, they largely pursue their commercial and artistic goals in nonconformist fashion. Their effervesces with which they stitch together a multiplex of genres is as much professional as it is homegrown. They also cover Tom Waits’ “I Wish I Was in New Orleans.” Not since Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes has anyone come as close to staying within Waits’ song character and also giving it a fresh coat of paint. In a word-coolness!\n\nWith talent, easy confidence and self-deflating humor, the colorful Shewell will win countless hearts and minds, injecting warmth, graciousness, and good, lasting songs into a mega-pop world.\n\nShannon McNally - Small Town Talk (Independent)\n\nSmall Town Talk is a tribute album to Cajun songwriter Bobby Charles. I’m not familiar with Charles, so I don’t know how close to the vest, or if her renditions are somewhat off kilter, but either way all the songs here are remarkable. Given the facts that McNally’s established reputation as a songwriter and along with a best-of-the-best team of musicians including among others Dr. John and Derek Trucks, I can certainly say that she is well-equipped to take on his work.\n\nThere is a healthy amount of bounciness in the good old New Orleans tradition, but the slowest and most gentle come across as the most genuine. McNally sounds perfectly at home, and the strong sense of personality required in a good cover version is certainly present. She plays the true lover on “But I Do,” the woman left behind on “I Don’t Want to Know,” wearing desperation just as well as she does romance. The most poignant is the rosy “String of Hearts,” which finds her dancing in and out with a male vocalist amidst a softly falling piano line and swells of strings. “Homemade Songs,” with its swirls of reverberating guitar and downright sweet lyrics, runs a close second. Small Town Talk is a fitting display of both legacy of a past songwriter and the reach of a modern talent.\n\nJann Klose - Mosaic (jannklose.com)\n\nWhile there has been substantial support for modern singer/songwriters at the grass-roots level, if they don’t play an identifiable brand of rock or pop, they are still unfortunately an anomaly in the music world. But here’s the thing with Jann Klose; he and his band can take a genre like reggae (“Make it Better”) and turn it into a poetic statement that we can all shake our tail-feathers to! Jann is a real singer in the sense that his confidence and moxie are easily conveyed in every song on Mosaic. He has the haunted power of someone who truly feels his lyrics. Jann recently provided the vocals for the movie “Greetings From Tim Buckley,” and he includes an a cappella cover of Buckley’s “Song to the Siren,” which is just…amazing! He not only captures Buckley’s soul, but you also know that it’s Jann singing - not an easy thing to do.\n\nThe album is focused, displaying the songs in a sometimes complex, sometimes barebones style, but the overall statement is that Mosaic is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. Love, passion and intelligence come to the forefront in a strong display of craft and talent.\n\nJann’s music - a smoothly accomplished and undated collection of tuneful styles - is warmly realized in well-written songs filled with subtlety rather than eccentricity. At times the use of rudimentary production highlights Jann’s voice as much as the dynamic playing when the full band is included.\n\nInsightful intelligence and tenderness make Mosaic a stunning work by an exciting, relatively new artist.\n\nPepper (pepperlive.com)\n\nIf these young Hawaiians weren’t so studiedly intense, Pepper might be able to drop the Sublime/neo-Beach Boys pretensions and use their evident talent to make enjoyable records. They write catchy, ant hemic songs, but the tireless exhortations are trying and, worse, can become ludicrous.\n\nJust about every song here are like splices of roughed-up reggae and ska. They sound more like posers rather than trying to find a different and unique way of exploring these genres. They’re all smeared with melodramatic, over-blown hooks. Pepper has an excess of passion; what they lack is the subtlety that keeps bands like Sublime for becoming histrionic.\n\nWith all that said, I’ll let Tim Norek, fellow Jersey Beater have the last word; “I kind of liked the album until I played it for a friend of mine. As each song came around he started singing The Sublime song that they had taken parts from. I was happy and sad all at the same time!”-Phil Rainone\n\nCatbirds Say Yeah (thecatbirds.net)\n\nOn Their self-titled album, Catbirds Say Yeah starts off with a blast of bluesy alt. rock on “All I Wanna Know Is.” This track shows the interesting dynamic between the band members. Actually, each number on this album is unique in their own way, with the band switching up who sings each one. Songs like “Red Red” and “Stoned” feature off-kilter rock guitar chords and straight-ahead vocals. Even with all that said, there is a distinct sound on this record. The clean/distorted guitars work well with the drums and the bass pops with a steady beat.\n\nThis is an album from a group of musicians with copious amounts of energy. Catbirds Say Yeah is where they creatively express themselves and transfer the spirit from their live performance (I checked out their YouTube show), and inject it into whoever is listening. This is a unique band that has found their passion, the ability to produce roaring electronic sounds, and bring others to their feet to dance.\n\nSalt - Radio Station\n\nSalt sounds like they’re trying to emulate one of their influences The Cult, which to me are big shoes to fill. The Cult have made sporadic albums over the years, but their singles are dead-on (“Wildflower,” “She Sells Sanctuary,” etc.).\n\nI don’t know if Salt is just trying too hard or just don’t give a shit, but the way their music comes out on their self-titled album is not fun to listen to. Besides sounding like it was recorded in someone’s garage (which is not always a bad thing), the lead singer just sounds like he’s hurrying through each song with the passion of someone who’s watching the clock, trying to get outta there as soon as possible. The band sounds like they’re playing by-the-numbers, and they watching the same clock, in a hurry to get the hell outta Dodge!\n\nI think if they take their time in the future, run the songs through a live show and work out the bugs, that they would have a very listenable, interesting album!\n\nThe Demographic - Listen Close (the-dem.com)\n\nSomewhere between The Who’s powerhouse, maximum R&B and The Pixies’ poppy, nasty, slow-as-fuck hard rock lays The Demographic. But here’s the cool thing about them: They’re just a guitar/drum duo! No frills maximum rock ‘n’ roll from Northampton, Mass, Tom Pappalardo (guitar/vocals), and Sturgis Cunningham (Drums/backing vocals), “Explode into a rock ‘n’ roll band” (thanks, Bruce), on these eight jangle-pop, murderously heavy songs about fuckin’ up, malls, death, and secrets. Not your run-of-the-mill stories and the music will suck you into the lyrics and visa-versa.\n\nThe Demographic breathe new life into a genre that’s in need of a tune-up. These eight angry, vehement cuts rely equally on Pappalardo’s acrobatic guitar lines and vocal rants as well as Cunningham’s at times pounding/brutally quiet drumming. A match made in Heaven, as they say!\n\nThe last song “Simple Secret” ventures into deeper acoustic/electric territory. While Pappalardo drones on vocally ( very cool), and Cunningham matches his slow cadence with stop/start/ drumming, they create a song that not only gets your attention, but it dramatically changes the way you look at the little things that are usually overlooked in life. “Listen Close” has lowbrow cinemascope grandeur, with precision and economy. I gotta check these guys out live!\n\nSmoke Fairies - Blood Speaks (smokefairies.com)\n\nHere’s another duo (Jessica Davies on guitar/vocals, and Katherine Blamire on drums/vocals), that can rock out like The Pixies, yet pull back once and a while bringing us back to the John Hawkin -era (keyboard player), Renaissance (60’s progrock band). With all that said, Smoke Fairies’ definitely blast off into their own universe.\n\nSongs like “Let Me Know,” “The Three of Us” or “Blood Speaks,” all display disjunctive imagery set slightly to gothic arrangements. The results are eerie and moving, but not distracting. Trembly guitar scrubs and syncopated drum flourishes round out song after song. Not filler, but like a magnet to steel, they are quietly powerful, drawing the listener in deeper and deeper. There’s plenty of drive and power in this album and the straightforward lyrics give the band a real, solid identity.\n\n“Blood Speaks” is an album that you need to make time for. Sit, listen, and enjoy!\n\nBob Marley & The Wailers - Kaya reissue (Island)\n\nIt is safe to say that the world would be a very different-and vastly poorer-place were it not for Bob Marley. Carrying the homegrown sounds of a small Caribbean island to Europe, Africa and America, he is directly responsible for a rhythm and style that has moved millions and influenced every form of popular music for more than four decades. By exploring his roots and culture he brought them far beyond his native Jamaican borders and encouraged widespread cultural curiosity, as well as sparking the rediscovery of his heritage by countless people of all nations.\n\nOn the 1978 release of Kaya a lot music critics at the time felt that Marley and The Wailers were heading toward the MOR (Middle of the Road) side of the radio dial. They thought songs like “Easy Skanking,” “Misty Morning,” or “Time Will Tell,” were milking previous melodies and had very little to say that was inspiring, or had been said before on previous albums. To counter balance the critics the fans made it over a million seller, and his concerts were mostly sellouts. After 35 years the reissue of Kaya, which includes a full show from the Netherlands in ’78, falls somewhere in-between the critics and fans opinions.\n\nA lyric in the first song “Easy Skanking,” on the understated but enticing aptly describes the record: “We’re taking it easy/we taking it slow.” At the outset, the lighter sounds and personal lyrics that fill the sunny grooves skirt the big issues for joyful celebration, and gentle romance including “Kaya” and “Is This Love.” But the mood slides straight downhill from “She’s Gone” to “Crisis,” culminating in the fatalistic spiritualism of “Time Will Tell.” Fast forward 35 years and what were considered at the time by the critics a MOR sound, now sound more full of life, and somewhat apocalyptic then when the album was first released. On top of that the songs that shown the brightest at the time like “Sun is Shining,” “Satisfy My Soul” and “Easy Skanking,” now sound more interesting, not just by the re-mastering but by history itself. Bob Marley & The Wailers, including their backup singers The I Three’s may not have foreseen the future on Kaya, but the music-the soulfulness and mojo-can be felt in every song. Kaya is for your mind, body and soul!\n\nRecorded onstage in Rotterdam, Netherlands July 7, 1978 the live disc draws heavily from previous albums, and includes two new songs (“Easy Skanking” and “Is This Love”), thereby summarizing and expanding upon Bob Marley & The Wailers international career to that point. More so than in their studio versions, the songs ring with emotional power in these concert renditions allowing the listeners to join Marley in his life-affirming celebration. Like its live album predecessors, “Babylon by Bus,” and “Live!” which was recorded at the Lyceum in London, England, it shines a light as well as casts a shadow on the good and evil in the world.\n\nIf you listen to the album with that in mind, in the end good triumphs over evil with hope, love and happiness as the end result. “Positive Vibrations,” “The Heathen,” “Is This Love,” and “Concrete Jungle” are good examples of this. They reflect life’s ups and downs with Marley’s world-weary, but at the same time microscopic view. By the time they get to the last four songs (13 in all), you’ll be celebrating right along with the band and the fans. “Jamming,” Easy Skanking,” Get Up, Stand Up,” and Exodus” have a euphoric flow that is at the same time grandiose as well as highly personal. Bedsides making good use of a horn player on Kaya and the live album, the live album brings the past full-tilt into present. Not an easy task but Bob Marley & the Wailers always seem to know how to touch us. Like I said before, mind, body and soul!-Phil Rainone\n\nA TRIBUTE TO RON ASHETON: Featuring Iggy & The Stooges & special guests - DVD (mvdvisual.com) - All profits will benefit the Ron Asheton Foundation\n\nGet On Your Docs & Rock!!\n\n“Ron Asheton truly played outsider blues…”- Henry Rollins\n\n“Scott and Ron (Asheton) got the chance to orbit the globe and actually see for themselves the hundreds of thousands of fans that were into The Stooges music. No award or book could ever duplicate the feeling they got seeing that firsthand…” Deniz Tek Stooges’ guitarist\n\nThis documentary DVD captures the tribute to Ron Asheton concert, filmed live at Ann Arbor’s Michigan Theater on April 19, 2011.\n\nOpening the night was Space Age Toasters. Lead singer Will Smith mentioned that Ron had come up with the name, and besides a couple of originals they blasted their way through a few Stooges tunes, the most provocative being, and “1969.” The way they played it spoke volumes of their respect and dedication to Ron and The Stooges. They floored the audience right from the start, and there was still over two hours to go!\n\nOpening with an inspirational speech from MC Henry Rollins (Black Flag), he told of how Ron quietly influenced future punk rockers with his positive spirit and DIY attitude. Then Henry brings out the Stooges sans Iggy, and calling it the “Second American anthem,” they break into “I Got a Right” that, if anyone in crowd wasn’t already on their feet, they surely were by now! It was a blistering bang of hot punk rock with Rollins as the cheerleader.\n\nThen to thunderous applause (yea, some of the crowd even spit it Iggy as he took the stage-ahh the good ol’ days), Iggy Pop wandered out from backstage already shirtless/jeans down below his hips, ready to kick the shit outta The Stooges catalog. With a howl and yelp the band breaks into “Raw Power” that is just…amazing! For a song that’s over 40 years old, it sounded just as fresh and dangerous as the original. Their 20 song set was as iconic as it was just flat-out fun! They played a lot of their best known stuff like “Search and Destroy,” “Gimme Danger,” 1970,” and “Fun House,” to name a few. They also played lesser known songs like “LA Blues,” “Night Theme,” and “Open Up and Bleed,” but here’s the thing: It wasn’t like they played each song like their lives depended on it, but more like a band with something to prove. It was loose, hot and done with extreme coolness. Punk rock to the max!\n\nWith the passing of Ron Asheton, Iggy asked former Stooges’ guitarist James Williamson (The Stooges just released a new album with Williamson on guitar), to step in. He did a great job and is now a full-time Stooge again. The Stooges also consist of Mike Watt (Minutemen), on bass, along with Ron’s Brother Scott on drums, and they added Steve Mackay on Saxophone (he thickened up “1970” and most of the songs throughout the show), and Deniz Tek as second guitarist. For the tribute they added an orchestra…. Ummm… yea…a thirteen piece orchestra! And it worked! They opened the show to a lot of hoots and hollers as a good chunk of the crowd thought it was a joke…it wasn’t! The played a lil bit of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water,” and some classical stuff, than they came out about half way through the show as puzzled looks were on almost the entire crowd. Grinning from ear to ear Iggy and the Stooges blasted into “Fun House.” The mix of punk and an orchestra never sounded better! Genius!\n\nIggy did some crowd surfing from time to time that was cool, but he outdid himself a few times. Sitting on the front of the stage by the crowd he started taking to a girl, asking the stagehands to “Put a spotlight on this beautiful girl.” He sweet talked her for a minute, telling her how pretty she was. Than the band launched into “Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell,” which made her smile even more!- Ahh, love!\n\nOn “I Wanna be Your Dog,” the subservient song turned from a request into flat-out DEMAND, by the songs end. The only other band that I’ve seen gives that song such an incredible reading was Joan Jett & The Blackhearts. Amazing! Simply amazing!!\n\nAfter over two hours of non-stop punk rock, Iggy sat down on a chair new the edge of the stage with Mike Watt, who played an improvised slide guitar face up on his lap. There was no title given to the song, but Iggy got really personal at first talking, than singing about Ron and all the stuff they’d been through as a band and as friends. I’ve never seen Iggy so humble…\n\nBringing the full band and orchestra back on stage of the last encore, the jammed on “No Fun” which nearly brought the house down! Iggy invited the crowd up on the already crowded stage as the band played the song like it was their last time on Earth! What a great show, and what a terrific tribute to a man who has given us so mush over the years!\n\nThe Rolling Stones - 50 Licks: Myths & Stories from Half a Century by Pete Fornatale (Bloomsbury Publishing)\n\nAbout a year ago we got the sad news of Pete Fornatale’s passing. It was quite a shock because like most of our rock idols (Pete was a radio DJ for WNEW 102.7 & 90.5 The Night), we feel they are pretty indestructible. Back in the 60’s & 70’s Pete was one of the primary DJ’s for a new radio format called, “Freeform Radio.” Take about putting some new coloring in your paint box!-Pete along with other like-minded DJ’s help break new bands like The Who, Richie Havens, The Stooges, and all the punk bands that lit-up the 70’s & 80’s and beyond, and of course The Rolling Stones. He was one of the first DJ’s to TALK to you like a new found friend, as compared to the Cousin Brucie’s of the day who basically were the original “talking heads.”\n\n“50 Licks” is a no frills, we-don’t-take-shit-from-nobody, kind of book. Its “no-frills” in that they eliminate all the posing, all the nonsense, and especially all the retreaded crap that bogs even the best books down (anyone read Clarence Clemmons book)? Instead they go for the throat, just like The Rolling Stones did back when they first got their start back in the 60’s (and still do today) with The Beatles and the first wave of The British Invasion. Want makes this book different from “Tell-all” books (check Keith Richards autobiography), and run-of-the-mill “factual” books is that besides being a really cool book to read (I could hardly put it down), they used a variety of musicians, including The Stones, and even everyday fans like Kurt Schwartz. - Schwartz’s claim to fame was that he listened to all the Stones albums in chronological order from start to finish. “So what?” you might ask? Well, he then gives his opinion for every song. It’s like he has a photographic musical memory. Maximum coolness!\n\nThe book is full of quotes, interviews and yes, myths. They include an interview that Fornatale did with Bill Wyman (bassist), back in 1981. Its fun, factual, and you come away with a better appreciation of the man called “The silent stone,” as Wyman had pretty much been in the background by choice, and very rarely gave interviews. They kind of divide the chapters up into each Stones album in chronological order. It’s not the kind of the old, “Well-we-wrote-this-song-because…it’s more like they give you the inside scoop of the recording sessions with quotes from The Stones, the roadies, and their peers like Hubert Sumlin (best known as Howlin’ Wolf’s guitarist).\n\nLike The Beatles, The Rolling Stones were punk, way before the word was used to describe the genre. Their first few albums were nasty, trashy, bluesy/rock, which mostly covers were, but like The Beatles (check their live albums for the Cavern club back around 1962), they added their original take on songs like Check Berry’s “Around and Around,” or Bo Diddley’s “Manish Boy.”\n\nThe Glimmer Twins Get Punk-As-Fuck!\n\nThe chapter on the making of and release of “Some Girls” back in ’78 is really a lot of fun to read. Keith Richard’s hails it as a return to their rock ‘n’ roll roots, while Mick Jagger felt like the punk bands of the time like the Clash, and Sex Pistols were looking down on them for selling out, and pretty much forgetting what their music was supposed to be about. Either way, a great punk album came out of those sessions! And let’s not forget one of punk’s national anthems. “Satisfaction” is given an extensive look at with quotes by The Stones mostly, but again, the inside scoop is, “To die for…” as they say!\n\nAll though the book they have short but interesting interviews with people and musicians that helped the Stones music in small, but amazing ways. For the recording of “Gimme Shelter” they interview Merry Clayton, the woman who said backup on it, and blew everyone away with her apocalyptic-style vocals. Great stuff!\n\nHere’s one of my favorite quotes from “50 Licks”… “We were coming back from a gig and I wanted to have a wee-wee (piss), so we stopped at a garage-and they refused to let me so I went back to the car and Mick said, ‘Come on, Bill, we’ll find one,” and Brian Jones as well. So the three of us went over there (back to the garage), and they still wouldn’t let us use it, so we just did it there (on the street), and got arrested. We got publicity for about a year on that one. It was then that we realized what we had to do get publicity, you see.”- Bill Wyman This book is so much fun to read!\n\nI’m going to let Pete Townshend have the last word…”The Stones will always be the greatest for me. They epitomize British rock for me, and even though they’re all now my friends, I’m still a fan. Guys, whatever you do, don’t try to grow old gracefully; it wouldn’t suit you.”\n\nThe Racer - Passengers\n\n(theracermusic.com)\n\nThis record begins with a soft but interesting instrumental called “Passenger (Intro).” From there and throughout the rest of the album the bass and drums maintain the rhythm while the guitars stick out in the background. The songs place an emphasis on life, love, emptiness, and everything else that comes in-between, while the lead singer’s vocals lay on top.\n\nThere’s a lot of exploration as the guitars bring you deeper into a song like on “Celebrate.” The title track and “Legends” have a similar level of exploration as the instruments create a wall of sound underneath the vocals. Both songs are about five minutes long and showcase the use of rhythm and lead guitars in addition to the rhythm section.\n\nThe Racer’s sound is a culmination of various music genres but more importantly, they are a rock band-one with unending riffs, solos, and vocals that remind us of past rock influences. The evolution of their sound throughout this album shows the group’s ability to play, write, and produce music, something that is truly admirable.\n\nThe Defending Champions - Breakfast of…\n\n(thedefendingchampions.com)\n\nThe Defending Champions blend a unique and functional blend of ska, Chicago blues, Latin, and rhythmically twisted rock as a chaser. Mixing socially and politically aware lyrics with infectious dance rhythms, the band serve as a virtual blueprint for any band today that wants to do it properly with an eye toward over-the-top humor.\n\nThough diversity in contemporary music is generally laudable, the factionalism it sometimes engenders isn’t; The Defending Champions’ ability to appeal to different audiences suggests that ska needn’t always polarize listeners into incompatible camps. Sometimes soulful ska, sometimes lighthearted and bubbly, the band’s style of execution is actually informative as it is danceable.\n\nDisplaying added maturity and creativity, songs like “Lucky Man,” “Relax a Little,” or “Candy Cane” grow their ska roots deep. You can not only hear glimpses of Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley, but you can also trace their roots to more current bands like Reel Big Fish and The Bosstones. Ska and Chicago blues never sounded better!\n\nTHE TOSSERS - The Emerald City (Victory Records)\n\nThe Tossers have been one of the few Celtic punk bands that have consistently been improving their music, yet still able to hold onto their roots. On “The Emerald City” (which is located in Chicago, according to the lyrics), they further explore soul, punk, and of course their Irish roots. Heartfelt tributes to life, love, and the road less taken are familiar scenarios, but The Tossers find new twists and turns that will make you smile as well as raising an eyebrow in amazement!\n\n“The Rover,” “Here’s to a Drink with You,” and “God Bless You,” is at once a raise-your-glass-for-a-toast song, as well as something deeper and more meaningful. The music, spiritual and lyrical balance that the band comes up with time and time again is cool, fun, and enlightening. Equal parts heartfelt tributes and modern relationships are abundant throughout “The Emerald City.”\n\nFiddles, banjos, mandolins, raging guitars, and an excellent rhythm section serve not only to embellish the singers throaty, whiskey-soaked vocals, but they also take turns as lead instruments along the journey through “The Emerald City.” The music can turn from subliminal to rollicking punk rock at a moment’s notice and The Tossers perform it all with an eye toward freshness and originality.\n\nOne of my favorite songs is “Wherever You Go.” It starts off as a prayer-like slow waltz (“Come fill up your glasses with whiskey and beer/and may God bless and keep everyone of you here…May peace be with you your whole life through…”). Then, a little over a minute into the blessing-like psalm, the tempo changes to a hot strut as well as the lyrics(“Now woe to you wherever you go/To all of you bastards who have treated me so/Wherever you go/Whatever you do/ May you suffer the curse I put on you/FUCK YOU!!..”). Now, that was just amazing…I didn’t expect them switching gears so quickly and ruthlessly! It reminded me of The Pogues’ co-dependent, wild Christmas tune“ Fairytale of New York,” only more powerful.\n\nClever melodies, tight arrangements, and honest, heart-felt lyrics on “The Emerald City” paint a musical picture of a band and their view of the life with 20-20 vision!\n\nJOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS - Album (Blackheart Records)\n\nFor Record Store Day this April 20, all the mom & pop record stores around the county celebrated their independence with special releases exclusively for them. Joan Jett and The Blackhearts reissued the 1983 masterpiece Album (ummm…kind of a generic name for a record but, dang…it will rock your socks off)!\n\nThis limited edition 180 gram vinyl (dude, you don’t need to get your scale out to weight it), individually numbered, is one of the finest, freshest vinyl records this side of Maryland (Joan’s a hometown gal and avid Orioles fan), and they made sure you would really take notice of It in cannery yellow colored vinyl! They also include an enhanced CD with bonus tracks and live footage of The Blackhearts circa 1983. And if that’s not enough they also include a Blackheart Records sampler of their current band roster. They also include a little note saying that a new Joan Jett and the Blackhearts album will be out this fall. I can’t wait!\n\nThey programmed the album in its original form and added a few songs at the end of sides A and B (mmm…it feels so good to flip the record over. To me it makes you appreciate the music in a more hands-on way). “Fake Friends” is a stone cold thrashing about “DICKHOLES!” You know, those so-called friends that are two faced, shallow and say things behind your back, to put it mildly. It’s both funny and sadly true, but the music propelling it has a start/stop/start cadence that is head-boppin’ punk rockin’ cool-as-fuck!\n\nFrom there, Album is jump started to “Handyman,” “Everyday People,” “A Hundred Feet Away,” and “Secret Love.” Nowhere near a dog-and-pony show, these five songs are like horses at a starting gate ready to run and give it their all, as soon as the bell rings!- Real-deal punk rockers from start to finish. The Blackhearts version of Sly & the Family Stone’s ode to equality and open mindedness is revised as the Blackhearts pump it up a gazillion notches from the originals gentile but soulful mix. The also include an amazing cover of The Stones “Star Star” ( they drop the F-bomb over a dozen times). They take the Stone’s original blues rock version and turn it into punk rock anthem! I think Green Day covered it at one of their shows in recent years, with Billie Joe adding his own punker-than-you version. It just goes to show how cool it is to see the gantlet passed from generation to generation, humbly paying tribute to the original version and amping it up into a whole new, and fresh version!\n\nOK, HERE’S The COOL PART KIDS!\n\nStop your record player (you DO have a record player don’t you?), gently lift the record off the spindle (the short stubby sliver rod), with two fingers (be careful of finger prints and smudges). Flip it over to side 2 and gently replace it on the spindle. Hit “play” and we’re off into punkrockville! “The French Song” is so cool that you’ll what to lean what the words are in English. It’s like when The Beatles sang “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” in German. It opens up a whole new world that is just….amazing!\n\nThe Blackhearts revisit a Runaways (Joan’s first band) tune, “I Love Playing with Fire.” Probably about ten years after the original, but they give it a fresh punked-up reading. Like Springsteen and the E Street Band and their own version of rock ‘n’ roll, The Blackhearts are able to create their slice of punk rock that is so much fun, and amazingly cool! I remember reading that Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters), had mentioned back when Nirvana was together that the Blackhearts were influential as well as the Runaways. To me , that’s what makes music so magical. You can take from the past and turn it into something fresh and unique without losing its history, if it’s done right.\n\nThe Live footage of the Blackhearts is a good representation of the band’s middle period with Ricky Byrd on lead guitar. Barely out of the 70’s when a lot of the punk bands of the day were either folding up camp or floundering with their gigantic, we’re-only-in-it-for-the-money record companies, Joan Jett (Blackheart Records is her record company basically), and the Blackhearts were releasing records, playing shows and not only maintaining a faithful loyal following, but they were also bringing new comers into the fold. “Album” is a prime example of Joan Jett and The Blackhearts long and dedicated journey. They’re into the music for the long run: Mind, Body & Soul!\n\nMike Lefton - What Are We Waiting For (cdbaby.com/cd/mikelefton)\n\nMike Lefton and his band succeed in balancing a love for crowd-pleasing Seventies pop rock with a 21st Century sleekness and a timeless sophistication. The mojo of mid-period Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel and snarly blues rock, is easily combined with the band’s youthful (they’re in their early twenties), exuberance. The band’s roots and branches run deep with rock, folk, and blues with a thick, sturdy trunk of rich, colorful rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n“Invalid” jump-starts the album with bang! A story basically about laughing in the face of all the lies and phoniness that we all run into throughout our lives. With the rhythm section (Skyler Lutz on bass and Carnel St. Louis on drums), they help to amp up Mike’s distressed lyrics with high-end style rock & roll, while Mike wails on guitar. You can’t help but root for the underdog.\n\nMike’s blue-eyed vocal swoon on “Funny” is surprisingly cool. I’ve seen him play over the years mostly at clubs and benefits, and he’s always rocked your socks off! “Funny” has a slow, sweet melody, but the lyrics are of loss and regret. With Skyler on bass and Carnel on drums they conjure up the melody of Simon and Garfunkel’s 60’s smooth-as-silk 70’s pop tune “Cloudy.” They bring the past into the present, and visa versa-not an easy task but it works fine.\n\nThe title cut “What Are We Waiting For,” has a walking-on-sunshine melody that is as infectious as any jangly, funky pop rock song out there now, and the impatient lyrics are romantically cool. With lines like, “How does love feel upon your heart/I do believe it’s time to start,” the song is like a combination of unexpected love-at-first-sight (the first time you see that person across the room and you absolutely flip, and what to get to know them), and growing out of the sadness of a bad relationship. Common everyday stuff but the band rises to the occasion with faith, hope and finding your soul mate as the end result.\n\n“Waiting for My Woman” sounds like a long-lost Partridge Family song (and that’s a good thing). With lines like, “Standing in the middle of a long traffic jam…/Waiting for my woman sweet as strawberry jam, and the “La-la-la-la-la’s” are Saturday-Moring-Cartoon-worthy! A very cool retro-style song done with the enthusiasm of The Rascals’ enthusiastic rocker, “Love is a Beautiful Thing.” Coo, stuff!\n\n“Black Stone Road” brings us back to reality. A funky blues rocker (the production is clear, and straight ahead on the whole album), about taking the road less traveled, wanting to do the right thing while all around you it feels like life is imploding. The song’s relentless, funky cadence is reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield. Both make loneliness and world problems not just inclusive but balls-out celebratory. Just five songs, but “What Are We Waiting For,” makes for a rich fusion of musical styles, and a hell of a party!\n\nMission South – Immigration Vol. 1 (3 song EP) (mission.south@gmail.com)\n\nMission South work hard to make a first impression, and even harder to make that much-needed second impression. With the mojo of Jack White’s blue-eyed psychedelic soul, and their own cosmic vibes, Mission South is at once trippy, and heavy-as-fuck! The opening song “Peaches,” has a stop/start cadence that is fuzzy and fun. A song about love and regret it suggests spaciness without ever blasting into the stratosphere. It’s an attention-getting swirl (just like the third song, “Kerosene”), that expands your mind.\n\nMission South just played at SXSW in Texas, as well as the gazillion bands that do so every year. Looks like our Boss (Jim Testa) found that elusive needle-in-a-haystack! You can get a free download of Mission South’s album at: www.music.missionsouth.com\n\nThe Scotch Bonnets - Live Ya Life (smelvisrecords.com)\n\nSkaville Meets Hitsville!\n\nThe Scotch Bonnets are a female/male fronted ska band that sound like they just got off the boat from Jamaica around 1965, and headed right into the recording studio in Motown. They play old-school ska with undertones of soul and funk much like The Supremes, Aretha Franklin, and all those soul searches from that era.\n\nMixing socially and politically aware lyrics with infectious dance rhythms, The Scotch Bonnets serve as a virtual blueprint for current ska bands that what to hear real-deal rude boy/rude girl music. Quietly percolating grooves are abundant in every tune on Live Ya Life. Sultry horn lines are centered around cool, heartfelt vocals that are instantly identifiable-not formula, but undiluted passion.\n\nThe entirely original material shows the bands vast creativeness at work. Inventive production, intriguing rock rhythms, powerful and memorable songwriting and new outlooks all combine to make a great record that remains rooted in reggae, but are much more diverse than the genre generally allows. “The Good One,” “Charm City,” and “Song for U,” is ace reggae/rock hybrids; “Live Ya Life” with its propulsive dance-rock beat and sultry sax lines shows the full range of The Scotch Bonnets’ development. A very impressive step forward from a band that is just taking their collective first steps. They know the formula for success, but they embraces it with an eye toward originality and maximum mojo!\n\nKeith Kenny - And the Light Came Blaring In (www.keithkenny.com)\n\nKeith Kenny’s music can at times convey sincere nostalgia, or bring you back to harsh reality real quick! His new album And the Light Came Blaring In Is full of mostly unembellished rock (Keith plays all the instruments with very little overdub or sweeteners,) blues and folk rock that focuses on his style of comfortable enthusiasm. That is, Keith has a way of laying it all out there, but sometimes it’s a slow, burning buildup, that draws you into the heart and soul of the song. He can also take you the dance floor stomping out Living in Circles with the mojo of Stevie Ray Vaughn.\n\nThe album is full of amusingly wry regrets, social observations, and heartfelt emotional outpourings, which all combine to travel the back roads of American music to fine effect. On “Filling Holes” Keith digs into similar roots and comes up with a clearheaded, plain-spoken song about love and loss. With just an acoustic guitar (like on songs on And the Light Came Blaring In), Keith leaves out the ambience of a full blown band in favor of perspective lyrics and strong melodies.\n\nFor anyone who listens to And the light Came Blaring In or any of Keith’s records, this music is a highly personal medium through which he can (and does) broadcast/exorcise his inner demons.- That’s not to say he doesn’t rock out (dang, this cat can make you practically leap outta your seat with his hot, swirling brand of rock ‘n’ roll), but Keith’s use of musical structures and lyrical imagery is exciting, intense-even cathartic- with a dash of punk without diluting the soulful strength and humor.\n\nWith minimal instrumentation And the Light Came blaring In is a one-man show (although Keith also plays with a full band at times), that plainly lies out the author’s heartaches, loves, and everyday problems. Keith crates songs with pride and dignity, making this a deeply moving document of sincere, honest emotions set into song.\n\nAll seven songs here are strong, and Keith has become a consistently good singer/songwriter; one can only hope that he gets a chance to develop even further for larger audiences.\n\nKeith Kenny is having a record release party at The Court Tavern in New Brunswick on March 23. You can also contact him at: keithjkenny@hotmail.com to get his new record or for more show information.\n\nAt Sea - A New Machine (atseamusic.com)\n\nIf you like The Killers, Mumford & Sons, or Big Star, than At Sea is your kind of band. They do not parrot their influences; they draw their inspiration from these types of bands but add originality and spunk. Nearly every song has some new twist, whether through production effects (very few pop records are as consistently aurally interesting as this without resorting to gimmickry), or an unusual instrumental or lyrical approach. Some of the songs are about deteriorating relationships-but the playing is so exuberant that’s it’s almost uplifting. Musical flourishes are abundant throughout “A New Machine,” achieving a fuller, modern over-all sound; instrumentation on many of the tracks is denser than most pop rock bands which shows some interesting musical explorations, as the band easily sidesteps run-of-the-mill themes.\n\nCrankshaft and the Gear Grinders - What You Gonna Do? (crankshaftmusic.com)\n\n“What You Gonna Do?” is like a spark that ignites into bonfire.-It starts off kind of subliminally, but by the time you get to the fifth song “King Pin,” you’re hooked! A mix of barroom piano (like The Band on “Music from Big Pink”), neo-rockabilly, and carefully placed vocal harmonies. Crankshaft and the Grinders (cool name-I can’t say it enough!), popularize American folk rock by telling it straight, embracing and updating ancient traditions without phony posing. Those who like Billy Bragg’s sound, or the afore mentioned Band are in for a largely topical (semi-political), dose of music that has been in limbo for a while. The lo-fi production adds a certain kind of laid-back approach, but it actually raises the listening appeal. You really what to hear to the WHOLE album, rather than piece by piece. Crankshaft and the Gear Grinders are gonna sneak-up on you and blow you away one song at a time!\n\nMrs. Skannotto - All These Evolutions (mrsska.com)\n\nSka is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950’s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960’s ska was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - From Wikipedia the definition of ska. The reason I brought us all to class was to either refresh our memories or to put a new color in your paint box, or maybe a little of both. When I first heard Mrs. Skannotto I was drawn back to my first experience with ska via Desmond Dekker and Johnny Nash (Marley would come a little later). They know how to subliminally get their sound into your cranium and put it on an endless loop that would positively affect you throughout the day with a smooth and sometimes rugged groove. Always featuring an unstoppable, relentless rhythm section. Fast forward to 2013 and Mrs. Skannotto is bringing those feeling back to me in spades! Although they use a more modern sound like Reel Big Fish or The Bosstones, they still use the core of the genre at the heart of all their songs. “Just as Well,” “Wage War,” “The Limit,” or “Free Speech Zone” all combine for the best of both worlds without sounding patronizing or snobbish. In fact, the whole album sounds like a refreshing blast from start to finish. “Poll Dance,” has Inspector 7’s (they just got back together and are playing at Asbury Lanes in April), written all over it! Wordy but not preachy, upbeat but not over the top, it will rock your socks off! The whole album mixes social and politically aware lyrics with infectious dance rhythms. Mrs. Skannotto is a band that I’d love to see live. When a studio album has me up and dancing around the room (and the pay me NOT to dance or sing), then I just know that at their live show I’d but upfront and personal, skankin’ to the beat no matter how hapless I look!\n\nCitizens Band Radio - Big Blue Sky (worldofCBR.com)\n\nRecorded at Trax East South River, NJ, Citizen Band Radio is a fine mix of country rock (the real stuff like The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Dr. Hook’s rollicking pop country). That’s not to say that CBR aren’t original- they definitely are, and they have plenty of mojo to spare.\n\nCitizen Band Radio are one of those special bands that even after repeated listens to their music, when you see them live they’ll simply amaze you with their thirst for an audience, I think. The male/female vocals add depth and expand the band’s emphasis on writing strong poignant songs.\n\nThe band’s music is sparse, angular and seemingly immune to genre divisions. Every song is unique, and each time you hear it you get a little something different slowly bubbling up to the surface. On songs like “Big Blue Sky,” “Drinkin’ Again,” “Sugar Sweet Mama,” and “Heart of Stone” there’s already ample evidence of daring songwriting that straddles the line between artiness and genuine fun and emotion. Most importantly, Citizens Band Radio continues to come up with strong melodies, challenging rhythms and affecting lyrics.\n\nEd Tang - Goodbye Zen5 Sushi Dinner (edtangmusic.com)\n\nWow! At first I thought I had put on a new Pogues album! Ed Tang has the phrasing, loopy style, and grit that the Pogues are known for, yet he’s as original as the come. The nine tracks come onto the listener strongly with songs like “Lincoln,” “Just Two Old Friends,” or “My Whole Life,” These are songs in which Ed Tang subliminally flaunts his vocal prowess while the band explores each song with the mojo of a band twice their age. The songs have somewhat dark tones with a firm message using the vocals as a lead instrument as the musicians remain persistent and in the groove.\n\nZen5 Sushi Dinner is a record that combines a few reoccurring themes-mainly those of love-and seeks to deliberately interpret them by providing the band’s own experiences as examples. The personal aspect of the record is really what makes it so effortlessly relatable without being out only a few negative feelings that we have hidden insides ourselves.\n\nPUNK- The Best of Punk Magazine Edited by John Holmstrom and Bridget Hurd (Harper Collins)\n\n“Of course New York City was the polar opposite of what it is today: The vast fields of decay in the South Bronx resembled Dresden after the firestorms in World War Two. The Bowery was still the “Isle of Lost Souls.” These were the roots of the ant-sixties culture: Peace and love were replaced by nihilism and deliberate anti-glamour. Goth and emo and proto-punk kids of today reference these years as their own personal history, just like the baby boomer crowd endorsed the sixties.”- Deborah Harry and Chis Stein, from the forward.\n\nMeasuring in at 11”x9 ½,” PUNK- The Best of Punk Magazine has the feel of the magazine/record album. A lot of the cartoons, photos and posters take up an entire page, and you get the sense of a really cool “coffee table book” without the usual crap associated with the stuff that passes for art these days.\n\nAnother thing that sets PUNK apart from the rest of the cookie cutter books is that all the photos and illustrations were taken by people (John Holmstrom, Debbie Harry, Chris Stein, Roberta Baylay, etc.), who were there right from the start where the NYC punk scene got it’ start. Not only “photographers” (I use the term loosely, and lovingly.-Many of them were kids with small, inexpensive cameras with a love for the new music, the clubs, and the exciting vibe), but musicians, and fans. People that wanted something new and different, not only in music but as they say these days, “a lifestyle change.”\n\nThe introduction by Gary Storm-former WBFO deejay (www.oilofdag.com), is worth its weight in gold! When he comes to describing the musical and cultural changes that punk rock was about to bring back in 1978 you almost feel as if you were there. As a DJ and representative of radio station WBFO, he was sent to New York City to get record companies like CBS and some of the other mega-companies to give the radio station more promos to play, etc. After hitting brick wall after rick wall with the tight, ultra-constrictive record “suits,” by happenstance he winds up in the Village, in NYC: “At night I wandered the Village and got a little drunk. One night I went to CBGB and saw a pop group called the Squirrels wearing high-heeled sneakers and also the psychobilly pioneers The Cramps, who closed their set with an extended version of “Surfin’ Bird” as the lead singer (Lux Interior), crawled across the tables smashing drinks… Later I stumbled into an ancient office building and rode a clanky elevator to the top floor, and then took a short walk down the hall into a cluttered, dinky office: the international headquarters of PUNK Magazine. Sitting behind a desk in short, shaggy blond hair was John Holmstorm, editor and chief artist. Slouched in a chair in front of the desk was another figure, wearing a leather jacket, square jawed and sandpaper complexion. I’d know you anywhere, Legs McNeil. You look just like John Holmstrom draws you.” I know it sounds like an average, everyday type of meeting, but that’s the beauty of it. Punk is very DIY-very self-sufficient, and have a “one for all-all for one” attitude. Yeah, the major record labels had their greasy, grimy hands out as soon as punk got on their radar screen looking for the “Next Big Thing,” but after all these years they haven’t come close to taming it, or even fully understanding it, for that matter. Anyway, would someone please kick out the soapbox from under me so I’ll stop ranting and get back to the book?\n\nOne of the things that made Punk Magazine so incredibly cool was the way that they used punk’s creed of DIY. The advertisements were mostly hand drawn with cartoonist figures like the ad for Trash and Vaudeville, a clothing store in NYC. It’s half a page all handwritten with caricatures of a hip guy and gal circa 1975, in black and white. - Eye-catching, and cool as fuck! I’m sure that PUNK Magazine operated on a shoestring budget, but like they say, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” The ideas and projects (they reprinted the punk comic book for “Mutant Monster Beach Party”) artistry that Holmstrom, his crew and the musicians themselves came up with is amazing!\n\nAnd don’t forget that back in the 70’s and even the 60’s (The Stooges, etc.); “punk” was a synonym for well, a PUNK!!- Someone who was considered lazy, a wiseass… you know the boy your Mom (there were also girl punks too), always warned you about, who would get you in trouble, or even worse-PREGNANT!!\n\nThe full-color pages with bands like the Ramones’ B-movie (directed by Roger Corman), “Rock ‘N’ Roll High School,” Clash, and the whole, unedited issue of Mutant Monster Beach Party are just…awe-inspiring!\n\nOnce you read (actually you’ll probably want to read it a few times), PUNK Magazine –The Best of PUNK Magazine, you’ll probably want to start you our magazine, punk band, or just use it as a reference as to what it was like back in the day when punk rock first reared its ugly head, bringing down (slowly but surely), all the shit music of the day like Disco, Prog Rock and all the laidback crap like the Eagles, Carpenters, and all the “Pat Boone’s” of their generation.\n\nPUNK only lasted eighteen issues from about 76’ to 79, but like when I got my hands on my first issue of Jersey Beat, I was hooked for life!\n\nBruce - by Peter Ames Carlin (Touchstone Books)\n\nWith The Help Of Springsteen, This New Biography Chronicles The Myth, The Man, and the Magic of New Jersey’s Favorite Son\n\nIf you find it interesting to read about Bruce’s childhood, his sometimes tumultuous relationship with the E Street Band, and other details of the Boss’ life and career, then this book is for you. You’ll read about the first time he saw Elvis Presley on TV, and the affect it had on him, learn about the frustration of the E Street band during the recording of “Born to Run” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town,”which seemed endless. And you’ll hear about the embarrassment the E Street Band felt when Bruce brought the band got back together after ten years, asking them through an employee. (“After all that time, to get a call from the accountant?” Gary Tallent, the bass player said in the book. “I was insulted.”) Throughout this fascinating biography, author Peter Ames Carlin is meticulous but never boring; investigative, but never to the point of sensationalism.\n\nWhen I first sat down to read “Bruce,” I just thumbed through it, for what I thought was only going to a minute or two, checking the chapter titles, photos, and a sentence or two. What happened instead was that I found myself after reading the title for the first chapter, “The Place I Loved The Most,” getting into it, and I didn’t stop until the end of the chapter. The same exact thing happened as I randomly got deeper into the chapters. After reading three full chapters, I realized what I had been nonchalantly doing, and repositioned myself starting back at the “Prologue: The Gut Bomb King”\n\nOK… I know unless you’re some kind of Springsteen super fanatic, you’re thinking, “Who’s The Gut Bomb King?” Actually it was Bruce’s nickname, which was later changed to “The Boss,” thankfully, when back in 1971. In downtown Asbury Park, Bruce with other musicians and friends would get together for a weekly Monopoly game that was anything but traditional. Using “coercion, trickery, candy bars and cream-filled cupcakes as bribes… Bruce excelled, due to his shifty powers of persuasion and leverage provided by stacks of candy bars, Ring Dings, and Pepsis he brought with him.” It’s funny, and so much fun to read.\n\nThere are also chapter’s on Bruce’s personal life, with detailed stories about his parents, family, ex-girlfriends, and even the long-silent ex-wife Julianne Phillips. There’s no interview with his wife Patti Scialfa, and virtually nothing about their three children. Also, past and present band members are interviewed, including their hurt feelings when Bruce broke up the E Street Band back in in 1985 after the Born in the U.S.A. tour. Again, Carlin does it with a sense of interest, but not over-the-top paparazzi-like stupidity. He’s as respectful as he is a journalist.\n\nSmartly, Carlin stayed away from dissecting the vast majority of Springsteen’s songs. However, he does interview Diane Lozito, Bruce’s ex-girlfriend immortalized in “Rosalita,” and a few other cool stories on the origins of some songs.\n\nSpringsteen gave journalist Peter Ames Carlin an interesting piece of advice for this biography, ” Bruce.” (Carlin has also written “Paul McCartney: A Life,” and “Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, & Redemption of the Beach Boy’s Brian Wilson.”) He said, “if there was anything I thought would make him uncomfortable, I should put it in,” Carlin writes. “He said to me, ‘Every time people start talking about me like I’m perfect, it diminishes me.”\n\nThe book is 494 pages, which dives deep into Bruce’s personal life in unprecedented depth. Carlin spent countless hours interviewing Springsteen and the entire E Street band, including Clarence Clemons weeks before his death, and his nephew Jake, who replaced him on The Wrecking Ball Tour. Carlin interviewed Springsteen for almost 20 hours, but Bruce also put him in contact with relatives, old friends, and co-workers, some of whom have never been interviewed before. He even allowed him to use photos from the Springsteen family archive. The book was written with Springsteen’s cooperation, though it’s not an authorized biography, meaning that Bruce had no control over it.\n\n|\n\nTo me, the more interesting stuff centers around Bruce’s music and the E Street Band. I’ve been a conservative fan since Greetings From Asbury Park, but really got into the music in depth when I found his approach kept the promises that had been made to me by my first real encounter with music, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show back in 1963 at the age of eight. Music, especially rock ‘n’ roll, was as necessary as the air you breathe, a fundamental part of life to me.\n\nDiscusssing the release of “Born to Run,” the tour that followed, and the court battle with then-manager Mike Appel to regain the rights to his music, Carlin talks about the way the record company wanted to use bigger venues and stadiums, to “sell” Bruce and the band to a bigger audience. It was a period when it seemed like the world was turning upside for Springsteen personally and musically. When the story turns to the rigors of recording and touring, unfair contracts, big money, and “business as usual,” you get that sick feeling in your stomach, that, “Well, that’s the way it is. Take it or leave it,” Carlin writes, “Contracts say whatever contracts say, but as far as Bruce knew, or cared, handshakes and the promise they symbolize meant more.” That’s it! Period! A person’s word is their bonds, and when I heard Springsteen and the E Street band cover songs like The Crystals “Then He Kissed Me,” or “Badlands,” or dozens of other covers and originals they’ve performed over the years, I get the same feeling. A lot of bands have come close, including punk and ska bands, but there’s that extra-special “something,” mojo, magic - whatever you want to call it. It’s present, it’s real, and you feel it. You want to share it with others. It’s not a religion, nor a higher power. It’s music, it’s life, and this world would be so morbid without it.\n\nUnless Springsteen writes his own autobiography in the future, “Bruce” is the go-to book for everything Springsteen. And if you want a dedicated fan’s perspective, check out: Backstreets: Bruce Springsteen The Man & His Music by Charles Cross.\n\nJohnny Society- Free Society (johnnysociety.com)\n\nJohnny Society blends blues, soul, alternative, and bits of rock together, on Free Society. But like the band Dr. Dog that I reviewed a few months ago, both bands have the same problem. It’s like they took all the afore mentioned genres and tossed them in a blender. Unfortunately, someone forget to turn the darn thing on!\n\nOn songs like “So Quick to Turn,” Well, Well, Well,” or the title cut, I’m hearing The Band, Dave Matthews Band, Phish, and some originality. Johnny Society comes up short on these songs and most of the album, actually. The few bright spots are “Fall so Low,” and “Stabbed in the Back.” These two songs rise above with originality and perseverance. The story lines are solid as is the music.\n\nFree Society would have made a good three or four song EP, and I’d like to see these guys live. I think they have more in the tank than meets the eye. There’s a lot of potential here, but they’re just not living up to it.\n\nErez and the End - “Silent Mountains” 5-song EP (ErezAndTheEnd.com)\n\nHere’s another band that seems to have a lot of potential, but they keep rehashing old Dire Straits. The vocals have an aged but unique vibe, but get drone-like after the first two songs. The music is up to par, but they’re missing some important mojo somewhere in the mix. I would think that live, they would bring their A- game and create some magical moments, but the in studio it sounds like they’re coloring inside the lines, making sure not to think outside the box.-Phil Rainone\n\nThe Januariez - Authentic\n\n(thejanuariez.com/thejanuariez)\n\nIn the liner notes where it says: File Under, for the type of music the band plays they list it as: Active Rock, Alternative. Umm… yeah… I would say so, but there’s also all the earmarks of a Death Metal band. On the inside of the album cover they have some sort pentagram, and two drawing of some sort of satanic beings that are not impressive. Black Sabbath did it better and it was more meaningful back in the day.\n\nOn Authentic, the music is anything but. There’s kind of a funky and alternative vibe here, but run of the mill stuff. The band doesn’t take you anywhere with their music. Last year I went to see Leslie West, and the two of the three bands that opened for him were just…awful! Bad Hair Metal, with no soul, no punch, just going through the motions. Januariez have no appeal whatsoever. Their studio album is lifeless, and I don’t think they would sound any better live.\n\nBruce Springsteen FAQ - All That’s Left To Know about The Boss By John D. Luerssen (backbeatbooks.com)\n\nWhen did Bruce first befriend Little Steven? How Did Springsteen avoid Vietnam? How did Bob Marley come to support him in 1973? What was the original title of Darkness on the Edge of Town?\n\nGive up? Or maybe you already know the answer to these questions but wait, there’s more!\n\nWhat classic song did Bruce sing at Clarence Clemons’ private memorial? How did Bruce meet Patti Scialfa? Who was “The Chicken Man” referred to in “Atlantic City?”\n\nWell, these any many, many more questions are answered in Bruce Springsteen FAQ! And that’s not all. The book is more than just 437 pages of fun facts. It’s more like a biography and history combined with questions that will enlighten even the most hardcore Springsteen fan, or the casual listener.\n\nThe writer, John D. Luerssen, is a Jersey guy who was born in Westfield, and was given his first two Springsteen albums, Born to Run and The River, as a gift from his grandmother on Christmas Day 1980. So his Springsteen roots grow deep and wide. For FAQ he not only used fans' questions but his own to make this a lively, energetic read.\n\nI thought I was a pretty big Springsteen fan, but as I read my way through, I started “dog-earing” the pages of interest, and questions and answers that flat-out had me saying, “WOW!” I didn’t read the book from start to finish, rather when I got to “Contents,” it was so interesting, and each chapter was so cleverly titled, that I started with my favorites like“I Hear the Lead Singer Shoutin’ Out, Girl,” or ”Just Like a Supernova: Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ,” or “Cool Rockin’ Daddy: Family Life.”\n\nThe book was hard to put down because every time I’d finish a chapter, it would leave me wanting more, and more! I almost OD’ed of Springsteen facts and history!\n\nWhat made the book and easy (but not quick), to read was that for each chapter like, “I Was Born Blue and Weathered: Springsteen’s Childhood,” instead of long, paragraphs that drone on, like some other biographies, FAQ is broken up into short paragraphs. Maybe five or six, sometimes ten sentences long which condense the book nicely without taking away the facts, or the fun of learning cool stuff about Bruce, the band, his family, and why here’s still so much interest after all these five-plus decades.\n\nThere are also quotes galore from interviews with Bruce (he didn’t have anything to do with the book), family, friends, band members, and especially the fans. There are also lots and lots of fun facts on not only Bruce’s studio and live albums, but also long sought after demos like “Back in Your Arms,” “I Dreamt My Love Was Lost,” and “Dry Lightning,” all of which were recorded in 1995 when he was recording The Ghost of Tom Joad. Again, it’s not a cut-and-dried book; the author injects his feeling and that of the fans, mixing them with facts and humor.\n\nIf you’re looking for rare and unseen photos this is not the book for you. Pictures of The Boss are few and far between, and are ones most every Springsteen fan has pretty much seen before. But that doesn’t mean that they’re not interesting. Take for example the play bill on page 181. It’s the old concert flyer for the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park in 1976. It was a Bill Graham Presents show in black and white, and the photo of Bruce on the poster is like a slice of music history. The photos here may be few but they are iconic when it comes to capturing a chuck of Springsteen history.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the book is where Luerssen gets into talking about the songs on each studio album. For the album Magic, he wrote a few lines about one of my all-time favorite Springsteen songs, “Girls in Their Summer Clothes.” “Reminiscent of the lush Phil Spector-produced pop records of the 60’s, this was the second single from Magic… Describing the song to Dan Cairns in the Sunday London Times in 2008, Springsteen said, “I was interested in having a song where you get this classic image of a late summer, light on, in a small American town. And it’s perfect in a way that only occurs in pop songs-when the air is just right, where the sun’s sitting a certain way.” A year after it release, Springsteen pulled in a Grammy for the song for Best Rock Song. “I didn’t even know I was up for a Grammy!” he marveled. “I opened the newspaper on Monday and saw that I had won, and thought, ‘Well that’s great!’”\n\nThere’s no gossip, no fluff stories, no dirt, or “Inquiring minds want to know,” Enquirer crap. Just cool stuff that any Springsteen fan new or old would be interested in reading about.\n\nThe only problem I have I with the book is with the subtitle where it says, “All That’s Left To Know.” Now, I’m not a hardcore Springsteen fan, but even someone like myself who’s followed his career all these years, and has enjoyed the music and the shows knows that there’s much, much more to come musically, and there’s also cool stuff that will probably fill a few books on Bruce. Like Bruce said when he was asked if he and the E Street Band would ever do a farewell tour about a year ago. He said in part that he felt like he and the band were just starting to peak, and that, “When you don’t see us anymore touring, then you’ll know we’re done.”\n\nThe Doughboys - Shakin’ Our Souls (thedoughboysnj.com)\n\nThe Doughboys have been shakin’ our souls since 1964 when they opened for bands like The Beach Boys, Grand Funk Railroad, and Question Mark & The Mysterians, to name just a few.\n\nOn their third studio release it feels like their just starting to get their second wind. Raw and gutsy garage blues, and bar band rock ‘n’ roll are not only at the core of their songs, it’s their hearts and souls. Songs like “Land,” “It’s a Cryin’ Shame,” “Route 22” heck, ANY song on Shakin’ Our Souls are all atomic-jukebox A-sides! But under the howl and growl of Stones-like vocals and a Social Distortion influenced guitar/bass/drums combo, The Dougboys aspire to the rough-granite poise and battle lessons of some of the great rock ‘n’ roll, punk, blues and soul stirrers past and present.\n\nThe whole batch of songs here are an exhilarating turbulence of convulsive rhythms and sharp wordplay that will leave a clean, profound mark on the listener. Once songs like “Route 22,” “Love is the Seed,” or “Until the Clock Strikes Doom,” get into your cranium, it’s really hard to listen to anything BUT rock ‘n’ roll and the blues! The latter song is at first, when you see the title it sounds kind of corny, but the lyrics will remind you of Bowie’s future shock “1984,” only now the realizations of Bowie’s Big-Brother-Is –Watching warnings are here and we’re all the worst for it.\n\nAfter you listen to Shakin’ Our Souls a few times you’ll hear the locomotive strumming; the slashing flourishes of the bands riffs that take you higher every time you hear it! Power chords that pins you to the wall and makes you hit “play” again and again. But what makes these songs and the last two Doughboys albums, and their live shows so special is what’s inside the songs: hunger, fury, despair, and joy, often all at once. You hear the blues, rock ’n’ roll, garage, and rockabilly that came before, transformed into their version, and they just kick out the jams all the way through!\n\nThey also brought in Mark Lindsey (Paul Revere and The Raiders, and solo artist), to sing background and saxophone on “It’s a Cryin’ Shame” (also Genya Ravan treats us to her vocal prowess, as she also does background vocals on the same tune), so I’ll let Mark have the last word: “Okay…so I get this call asking me if I’d play some sax and sing background on The Doughboys new CD. The cut was “Cryin’ Shame” and I thought it was cool. Then, I heard the rest of the project. Whoa… The Doughboys are for real… If this thing had come out in’65, there would have been one hell of a battle of the bands, if you know what I mean. But it comes out now, kind of like vintage rockin’ pop with 21st century twist. If this ain’t the real s**t I’ll hang up my rock and roll shoes. Dig the D-boys and rave on!”\n\nCudzoo & The Faggettes – Daddy Issues (Drug Front Records)\n\n“New York girls don’t take no shit/ we leave our house in our heels and our tits/Come in an hour just to lick our clits…” (first cut off Daddy Issues). How can you follow a cool-as-fuck line like that?-With a nasty drum wallop, slashing guitars, and a down ‘n’ dirty rhythm section, that’s how!\n\nCudzoo & the Faggettes is THE band that you Mom warned you about. Loud, rockin’ potty-mouthed, all-girl group that makes no apologies for being originally outrageous, and the new Queens of Noise (no disrespect to the originators, The Runaways).\n\n|\n\nGo back in time to rock ‘n’ roll’s musically conservative ’62-thru-’63 timeframe, a period dissolved by JFK’s assignation and preceding The Fab Four’s impending British Invasion of an unwittingly abstinent America. It was a safe haven ruled by harmless, harmonizing, sterile, serenading Four Seasons, or even the boring, ugggh…Pat Boone! They and dozens of bands like them were parentally approved softies pushing aside the putative erotic future icons like Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley.\n\nNow, with that in mind, fast forward to today and listen to Cudzoo & The Faggettes new album, Daddy Issues. They conjure up the innocently charming uptown soul of girl groups like The Ronettes, Shirelles, and Crystals-the streetwise toughies, the girls that didn’t take no shit from anyone, epically their boyfriends.\n\nCudzoo & the Faggettes are based on the same multi-harmony swoops and Wall of Sound that Phil Spector created back in the 50’s and 60’s, but even with all this reverence, the manage to stay real. Committing to 90’s riot-girrl (The Blackhearts were one of the originators along with bands like L 7 and Hole), empowerment while having loads of fun donning polka-dot party dresses, applying black eyeliner, sporting high-heel stilettos, and choreographing their own, unique style of dance moves. But, what sets them apart from their past role models is that there’s always that vixen-like nastiness juxtaposing the overwhelming sweet soul music that is in sharp contrast to the nasty-as-fuck lyrics. - But it works!\n\nEvery song title on Daddy Issues sounds like it could be made into a bad porn movie (“Daddy Issues,” “Fuck Buddy,” “Phone Sex,” etc.). But here’s the difference in what was then and what’s now: Cud zoo & the Faggettes thrilling retro-pop revivalism gains a solid rep. the more you listen to it. In a land that’s seemingly overrun by boy bands, and girl’s bands with a we- just-wanna-have-fun, attitudes, Cudzoo & the Faggettes are breath of fresh air. Let’s hope they get picked up by The Warped Tour next year, giving them some well-deserved exposure, and hopefully spawning many copycat bands, that will put their own spin on it!-\n\nThe Oats - “Funeral=Real Fun” 5-song EP (theoats.net)\n\nI’ve been writing for Jersey Beat for about 15 years (thanks, Boss), and one of the coolest things about getting CD’s, vinyl records, and back in the day cassettes is, you never know what you’re going to get when you open the mail box. In with a bunch of CD’s was this CD by The Oats. No press kit, and it was wrapped in a homemade “Jewel box,” that was made out of construction paper with a printed/written label, and the songs were hand-written on the CD.\n\nIt looked kind of what a grammar school kid would create if they were given paper, and a few colored markers. If you didn’t write for Jersey Beat, you would probably trash it without a second thought. But I do write for Jersey Beat and something like this goes right to the top of the pile to review!\n\nWith all that said, when you get into the album’s five songs you’re treated to some really cool pop/punk rock. Somewhere between the Violent Femmes and the Bouncing Souls The Oats map out some interesting musical territory... “Get me Going,” “Soon,” umm… hold on while I remove the CD from the player and turn the CD around a few times so I can read the song titles...Ok, The third song is “Hate List.” These three are definitely a “three-peat” as they say. They all have a tough pop punk core, but the vocals are smoother, even though the singer seems like he’s waxing poetic, all the while spewing about bad relationships and how fucked-up life can be at times.\n\n“Queen Jerry” and the last song “R,” kind of more of the same heartfelt spewing, but they rock on a higher plain. What’s cool about The Oats (terrible name-laughing out loud), is that they march to the beat of their own drummer, whether it be how they present their CD for review (the CD was marked as an “advance copy,” so I’m guessing that they will upgrade their “jewel box”-but it works), or the way they take chances with their music making it both accessible and obscure all at the same time.-Phil Rainone\n\nBlag’ard - Fresh Candy (blagard.com)\n\nDespite the “eye candy” on the front and back covers of the CD (naked-girl-holding-a-guitar-that-she-probably-doesn’t-know-how-to-play look), the duo of Joe Taylor on guitar/vocals, and Adam Brinson on drums/vocals, have the cool vibe of Jane’s Addiction, if Jane’s had not gotten humungous egos after their second album, and done mostly mediocre albums after that.\n\nBlag’ard actually down-size Jane’s Addiction huge sound, but not their mojo. “Candy Town,’ “Pony Boy,” or “Tea is for Cookie,” are somewhat off-the-wall-rockers with generous bits of twisted humor for good measure. Fresh Candy has depth and flavor (no pun intended), and they add a few bells and whistles here and there, not only to keep your attention, but to add originality. Fresh Candy is an album that doesn’t slip into tribute territory; this band is the real thing. Blag’ard are able to get to that wildness of rock ‘n’ roll, and marry it to discipline and tradition, making it sound effortless, awe-inspiring, and tight as nails.\n\nGirl Guts - Victoria (girl-guts.com)\n\nGirl Guts (cool name), have a hyper-punk sound that sparks the listener right from the start. No bells and whistles just straight-ahead punk rock that’s delivered with the enthusiasm of a band that just made their first record, and are dying to play it live (actually this is their first release). “Hard, dirty, and fast,” (as they say in the press kit), the music is uncompromising but easily accessible.-And you can dance to it!\n\nWell, what’s considered dancing these days (hey, they pay me not to dance OR sing), and you will have a blast and a half!\n\nChoruses that shout at you while you shout back the refrain will keep you in the pit, sweaty, tried, and you will definitely get your rage on. But this is also moshing for the serious-minded. They sing about religion, but not too seriously, as well as the tried and true stories like, “Birth, School, Work, Death,” as that 80’s song goes. Ultra catchy, ultra fun, this is the type of album that will draw you to their live show.-Hey, bring a bunch of friends. You’re gonna have a blast!-\n\nGutt N Buckett - Loans Jewelry Guns Luggage\n\n(facebook.com/guttnbucket)\n\nCowpunk Lives! Well, it’s pretty close to cowpunk (Reverend Horton Heat, etc.), but they add they own mum… originality. Gutt N Buckett is a band that does not take itself too seriously. On the contrary, they amp it up with well, “ooohs” and “ahhhs,” for a better term. It’s like when you write a song and you come to a point when you don’t have a line yet, so you just put in the “oohs” and “ahhs” temporally. Well, the “oohs” and “ahhs” are in there geminately, and we’re all the better for it! I know it’s a minor thing but like any good song that you can sing along to its catchy, and the mojo is maximized!\n\nThere’s also a cool quirkiness to the band, and these 21 songs. Mostly around the three minute mark, each one is like a slice of pizza, but with each slice having a different topping (mmm…pizza). Each one works on its own, but after you listen to the whole album it fits together perfectly like eight slices each with its own topping!\n\nGutt N Buckett is Dottie Buckett- vocals, bass, JT Buckett-drums, Hobart Gutt-Vocals/guitars\n\nYannick Noah - Homage (Sony Music)\n\nWhen you set out to create a tribute to someone (here, it’s Bob Marley), it’s epically important to not only get it right, but to also bring the listener to another place entirely. On Homage Yannick Noah fails at both. He comes close to getting it right vocally, but his backup band sleeps through a Muzak version of each and every song. Even the backup singers can’t come close to Marley’s original backup singers The I Three’s. There’s no soul, no mojo, no spirit. Just empty, lost versions that wouldn’t even sound good for a Karaoke night.\n\nECHO MOVEMENT - - Love and the Human Outreach (echomovement.com)\n\nUsually, when you come across a new band, at some point you find out that they have jobs doing something other than being moonlighting musicians, who usually play on weekends. When I met Echo Movement a few years ago at Martell’s Tiki Bar in Point Pleasant, they were an original band moonlighting as a cover band. I don’t know if they also held other jobs, but I thought that was a pretty cool way to on honing your craft. As a cover band they played mostly reggae and ska like Bob Marley and Sublime, and they would throw one of their new songs here and there.\n\nFast forward to this past summer, and Echo Movement are one of the shining stars when The Warped Tour hit New Jersey.-I guess all the “moonlighting” paid off!\n\nOn Love and the Human Outreach, Echo Movement gives us some cool, real-deal reggae, dub, and a slice of ska here, and there. From the opening dub instrumental “Rising Sunset,” (cool title); it’s old-school dub reggae to the max! This is the stuff that Lee Scratch Perry, and a lot of other first generation Jamaicans were doing.- Real guitars, keyboards, drums, bass, sax, and trumpet, and a few interesting add-ons like ukulele, and tempura. Otherwise, no crappy electronics like latter day reggae like Lady Saw, Beenie Man, etc.\n\nQuietly cool percolating grooves garnished with sultry horn lines making for an instantly identifiable sound- NOT formula. Love and the Human Outreach display a wider lyrical range, and increased vocal acuity. The title cut, “Play it Cool,” and “Sea Level,” are a few of the bright spots for the same relatively unwavering cloth that Echo Movement is known for.\n\nThe inventive production by the Fowler brothers, intriguing rock rhythms, powerful and memorable songwriting that remains rooted in reggae/dub, but is much more diverse than the form generally allows, shows the full range of Echo Movement’s development. Love and the Human Outreach is an impressive step forward from a band who already knows the formula for success.\n\nEcho Movement is Stephen Fowler-lead vocals, David Fowler-keyboards, Dan Gugger-guitars , Colin Bell-drums, Jonathan Butts-bass, Matt Lepek-sax, Nick Afflitto-trumpet\n\nAVON JUNKIES - The Lesser Evil (avonjunkies.com)\n\nA few months ago, the Avon Junkies ignited the Starland Ballroom opening for Catch 22 and Less Than Jake. Usually an opening band is like the sacrificial lamb: they get to go on first, but most of the time there’s very little interest, as a lot of the crowd are still on line waiting to get in, or milling about, not paying much attention to the band on stage Well, word must have gotten out because when the Avon Junkies hit the stage, you would have thought Green Day ( the Avon Junkies lead singer sounds strikingly like Billy Joe), had made a special, secret appearance. The Lights went up, and the band hit the ground running, and never stopped ‘til their 45 minutes set was over, filling up the open space in front of the stage almost immediately.\n\nOn The Lesser Evil, the Avon Junkies have a lot to prove, epically to anyone who had just heard their wickedly cool set, and had marched on over the band’s merch table to pluck up a copy of their new album.\n\nFor a young band, all the songs on The Lesser Evil are substantial and well thought out. “Addiction” was written like a story of a person with twice the age and experience, rather than someone in their late teens or early twenties. And that’s one of the many things that set Avon Junkies apart. They don’t settle for the same old thing. They reach, stretch, and embrace the future as much as they do the past. That is, they know their past experiences obviously, but they know that’s there’s also going to be some things that will be great, and some things that will be totally devastating their future. They live in the here and now, but they also possess some of the wisdom that usually comes with age, where you’re not just thinking about yourself, but of a worldlier picture.\n\nWhat I like best about The Lesser Evil is, although it’s a studio album, you get the feeling like your almost listening to one of their live shows. The production is crisp, clear, and the music will rock your socks off!\n\nThe Lesser Evil does not disappoint! I’m not sure what “wave” were up to now (Catch22 and Less Than Jake are considered “Third Wave Ska”), but dang, you can try to pigeonhole Avon Junkies as much as you want, but the best Pigeonhole I’d use is “originality!”\n\nTHE ORB Featuring Lee Scratch Perry - The Observer in the Star House (theendrecords.com)\n\nSome would consider the teaming up of a legendary pioneering reggae artist like Lee Scratch Perry and electronic wiz-kids The Orb, would be a match made in Heaven, since they both travel in the same stratosphere, but not so. I think a better collaboration would have been Perry and Echo Movement (see separate review for Echo Movement). Where the Orb plays it close to the vest with unimaginative electro beats, Echo Movement uses real instruments that actually energize the songs.\n\nOn The Observer in the Star House, The Orb tries their hand at dub reggae, and the results are mixed at best. Yeah, dub is supposed to have a slower cadence than reggae, and stretched out into a repetitive jam-like trance, but The Orb sound like they phoned in their part. No sparks, not even a smoldering fire, their beats are deadly slow and uninspired, and the only saving grace is Perry’s “toasting/talking” that lights up this album. His other-worldly chats/ravings are unmatchable. He’s been doing this for quite some time, and his stream of consciousness seems endless.\n\nSkip the album, and try to get to one of Perry’s shows if at all possible, or one of his other albums. The stuff (music) that this cat comes up with is out of this world!\n\nTHE BRIGANTINES - Vacation! The Latest From New Jersey’s Number One Surfing Group!\n\n(modernworldrecords.com)\n\nOk, so here’s a surf album from a New Jersey band (recorded in Jersey also), which to me sounds like a win-win situation. But are surf bands and New Jersey, to paraphrase the old promo for our state, “Perfect Together?” I’m a strict believer in the power of the music to move & groove you, but let’s see if The Brigantines can pass the “Punker Than You” test that The Boss used to use as a motto for Jersey Beat!\n\nWell, for starters, The Brigantines (and yes, they’re from Brigantine, NJ) feature Vincent Minervino on vocals, guitar, keyboards, and drums, and he has a cool plaintive voice… kind of like Jonathan Richman from the 70’s rock ‘n’ kitsch band, The Modern Lovers. Although not as ironic and loopy as Richman’s, Vincent is like the calm in the eye of the musical hurricane which the band conjures up time and time again on Vacation!\n\nWith Aaron Leonovich on bass and vocals, Scott Saint Hilaire on guitar, and Don Tojeira on drums, they creatively raid the roots of surf rock, garage, and at times punk, creating their own brand of rock ‘n’ roll that is a catchy as is forward thinking.\n\nYou get not only a Jersey vibe from the music, but also the California surf/folk rock sounds of bands like The Beach Boys and The Byrds. There’s also the garage mojo of the 60’s Northwest music scene, via Paul Revere and the Raiders and The Kingsmen. Simple, narrative tunes about love, loss, life, and yes, SURF INSTRUMENTS! Actually, to be correct, surf instrumentals!!\n\nThis stuff is A-1-worthy, blasts that would have you putting quarter after quarter on the jukebox! The Brigantines capture the ancient, twangy sound of bands like Link Wray and The Neptune’s, to name a few. It’s a solid instrumental sound that needs absolutely no words. You imagination is given free reign. The only limits are the outer limits, and that’s that rare, special place that only a handful of band’s can take us,-Now you can include The Brigantines in that group! Simply amazing! Uptight, outta sight, and definitely in the groove!\n\nPS- The Brigantines’ cover of The Ronettes 60’s hit “Then She Kissed Me” (they changed the original from “He” to “She”) gives the decades-old romantic rocker a fresh reading. You could almost mistake it for a song right out of The Brigantines repertoire. Cool stuff!\n\nSTRAWBS - Acoustic Gold\n\n(witchwoodmedia.com)\n\nWow! What a blast from the past, that’s as much in the present as any contemporary alternative band. The Strawbs came over here on one the many British Invasions back in the mid-seventies. With contemporaries at the time like King Crimson, Yes, and Fairport Convention, to name a few, they helped reshape and redefine the musical explosion of that period.\n\nBack then, FM radio was way more free form and this freaky psychedelic folk rock actually got a lot of airplay. (Can you name a major radio station that takes those kinds of chances these days? I know I can’t, except for college radio; no one has the imagination or desire. MONEY is the bottom line. ) On Acoustic Gold, you get not only Strawbs’ fan favorites like “Ghosts,” “Autumn,” and “Midnight Sun;” they also dig deeper into the catalog, and breakout cool gems like “Evergreen,” “The Man Who Called himself Jesus,” and “Cold Steel,” to name a few.\n\nThe beauty of this album is that the current Strawbs break down the original songs into their basic, acoustic form. It sounds more like you’re getting the sound of what the songs were like in their infancy, rather than just stripped-down acoustic versions, like so many bands do, without getting to the heart and soul of the song.\n\nThe Strawbs have to me have always been ahead of their time. The song structures, the lyrics, and the stories all take you places you never imagined. The creativity that each song is crafted with, are the type that can be handed down from generation to generation, and losing their potency. My favorite here is the “Autumn Suite.” I could listen to it in the blistering heat of August, or the freezing cold of February, and be quickly transported to a fresh, cool autumn day in October. The delicateness of the music, coupled with Dave Cousin’s lead vocal prowess are as exploitive now, as they were back in the 70’s when the song first saw the light of day. To me, that’s the measure of a band. - If they can reinvent themselves, and conjure up the original mojo and bring out something totally fresh and new, then I’m all in! The Strawbs are one of those unique bands.\n\nSTRATOSPHEERIUS - The Next World… (stratospheerius.com)\n\nBridging the gap nicely between heavy metal and art-rock is what Stratospheerius does best. They are interested in touching the mind as well as the heart. Songs like “Release,” “The Prism,” or “Gods,” are good examples. The songs unfold into mini, opera-like stories with music that subliminally transfixes the listener, but taking noting away from the story line. A fine line to walk, but the band does it time and time again with precision and an eye toward humor.\n\nThere are even touches of punk in the rhythms and rhymes. You can hear glimpses of Sonic Youth splattered against a canvas of lyrics that not only makes the song interesting, but also puts them in a league of their own.\n\nSometimes the sounds on The Next World… can be harsh-feedback, distortion and dissonance-but the group uses them to create a variety of effects and moods. If you think of a rubber band, where it can be stretched and pulled, and reshaped-than letting it go, and it goes back to its original form, you’ll have a good Idea of what this album is about. Exploring the outer limits, yet stay down to Earth as much as possible.\n\nThe English Beat- Live! At The US Festival September 3, 1982 and May 28, 1983 CD & DVD (Shout! Factory)\n\nBack in the late 70’s and well into the 80’s England was going through some very tough times both socially and politically, especially under Prime Minister Margret Thatcher’s iron-fisted regime. From those hard times came a positive, and meaningful musical, and social uprising that, if something similar had happened in the US during President Regan’s two terms in office, it would have surely been squashed, thrashed, and disband ASAP. I still remember The First lady, Nancy Regan’s response to the nationwide drug problem: “Just Say No.” –Funny how some things never change!\n\nAnyway, somebody please kick the soapbox out from under me- please! Enough politics, let’s get to the good stuff! The English Beat, like other ska and punk bands including UB40, The Specials, Sex Pistols, Clash, and The Jam, were all born from the 70’s and 80’s political and social upheavals. Where the Clash and Pistols chose to hit you in the gut with their Neanderthal punk rock, The English Beat were one of the bands that chose to get you on the dance floor first, with their 3rd Wave skatastic upbeat music that hit you in the gut along with their political stance.\n\nOn Live at the US Festival back in ’82 and ’83, The English Beat had reformed to play the fest. With all the original members in tow, they wowed the crowds with some of the best ska from “Over the pond (England),” as they say. The CD contains 16 songs that spam the bands career. From early si"
