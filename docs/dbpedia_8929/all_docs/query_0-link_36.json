Click on the small envelope icon to email them directly.\n\nSenior Leadership\n\nPrincipal\n\nChris Mitchell\n\nPrincipal Nau mai, haere mai ki te te kura o Ihu Karaiti te Kamaka! It is an honour and a privilege to be a teacher and educational leader here at Cornerstone Christian School. I can honestly say that I have spent the last twenty years doing my dream job – teaching students across the wider Manawatu region – five of those as Teaching-Principal at Awahou School in the Pohangina Valley, and here at Cornerstone Christian School since mid-2008. In 2016, I was appointed to the position of Deputy Principal and in January 2020 I assumed the role of Acting Principal. As a school, we tend to focus on the holistic development of each child – or to put it more simply, their ‘discipleship’. I believe that discipleship is simply learning to live the way that God wants us to live and I love being part of this process in our students’ lives. Ultimately our key desire is that every Cornerstone student comes to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and develops their own relationship with God. We have a strong character development focus with an emphasis on our values of respect, diligence, kindness and integrity with an underpinning value of humility before God. Although our children achieve highly in their academic education and our school achieves excellent results on a national level, I believe that it is more important to focus on their developing character than their academic grades. In our modern world, learning can occur wherever and whenever you like, but good character develops when you are young, so that is our focus; good grades, and achieving to one’s best, are a natural outflow of developing good character. On a personal level, I am married to Anne-Marie Mitchell who is also on staff here at Cornerstone Christian School as a teacher aide. Together we have four grown-up daughters – two of whom are also teachers here in Palmerston North. When not in school you will find me gardening or looking after our lifestyle block just out of Ashhurst; casting a fly for trout down at some local river or walking the hills with a pack on my back. My office door is usually open and I love meeting people in our wider Cornerstone family. Please drop in and say hello if you are over near the administration office or if you see me wandering around the school grounds. Ngā mihi nui\n\nDeputy Principal\n\nJames Rose\n\nDeputy Principal\n\nTēnā koutou.\n\nThank you everyone for the wonderful welcome I have received starting at Cornerstone this year. I have been impressed by the many supportive staff, parents and students that have popped in for a chat or a handshake to express their greetings.\n\nIn coming to Cornerstone, I join the rest of my family here. Mrs Rose of course is the Team Leader in Year 7/8, and Harrison and Ashton have been attending Cornerstone since they started school.\n\nFrom my point of view, it is a real joy to serve in the same school my family is part of. As such, in many ways, I am no stranger to the school. Over the years, it has been wonderful to stand on the sidelines of Hockey fields with other Cornerstone parents willing and cheering our sons and daughters on. Braving the fantastic winter weather that we enjoy here in Palmerston North and celebrating both the wins, and the character-building losses along the way.\n\nI really enjoyed the junior prizegiving last year and seeing the numerous ways our students have “stepped-up” to serve and give expression to our school values.\n\nI believe God created each of us in his image, yet unique, with our own talents, gifts, and personalities. Diversity is our asset in creation, we can’t all be feet or hands for example. Encouraging each person to follow Christ and use their gifts and talents as they do so will ensure that collectively we have the best chance to leave behind a “fruit that remains”.\n\nTo me, respect is the element that brings it all together, and remembering that each of us have\n\nbeen created in the image of God.\n\nJesus commands each of us to ‘love thy God and love thy neighbour’. As we do so, we learn to receive – and give – forgiveness, which in turn makes a path for healing and restoration.\n\nI come to Cornerstone from St Peter’s College where I served as the Deputy Principal – Head of Senior School and Curriculum. I have spent almost my entire career in Christian education and feel very blessed to continue that journey here at Cornerstone.\n\nThank you again for your warm welcome, and may God bless each of you in your journey with Christ.\n\nAssistant Principal (Y11-13), HOD Science\n\nHayden Hewitt\n\nAssistant Principal (Y11-13), HOD Science, Teacher (Science, Biology)\n\nI joined the Cornerstone Christian School community at the beginning of 2017. Prior to this I have taught Science and Biology for ten years, including a year teaching in the UK. Before teaching, I worked for as number of years as a Science Technician at Massey University and within the dairy industry.\n\nI am passionate about Science, and its relevance to all of us in our everyday lives. I love the way that we can see the Glory of God displayed in everything from the complexity of a single cell, through to the beauty and vastness of space.\n\nI am inspired by the idea that the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled. In my teaching, I hope to stoke the fires of interest and curiosity about the amazing world around us. I love being part of an enthusiastic and committed staff here at Cornerstone Christian School and belonging to the wider school community.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my wife and children, and cooking and eating food – especially dishes from other countries. I love being outdoors in God’s good creation, and I’m a keen deer stalker and fisherman.\n\nAssistant Principal - Middle School (Y7-10), HOD Maths\n\nIan Groube\n\nAssistant Principal – Middle School (Years 7-10), Head of Department for Maths\n\nKia ora koutou,\n\nBefore Cornerstone, I taught Mathematics for the past ten years at Feilding High School. I have also taught at Totara College in Dannevirke. I have always been passionate about Mathematics and I love teaching our young people how to problem solve using math skills. I am a firm believer that hard work is far more rewarding than luck.\n\nI was a student Te Aute College, and from there I joined the Navy.

She has now returned to us as a trained teacher. She started back with us at the start of Term 2, 2024.\n\nTeacher (Y5)\n\nRachel Hockly\n\nTeacher (Y5)\n\nI’ve had the privilege of being involved with Cornerstone Christian School since 2011, when I was a Year 4/5 teacher in the Tumanako team. Since then, my husband Scott & I have lived in different locations around New Zealand and had 3 children of our own.\n\nWith all our kids now at school, it has enabled me to dip my toe back into teaching, and what a blast it has been! The Cornerstone students and the Cornerstone environment are like no other. It is a pleasure to spend time teaching, and learning from, Cornerstone’s kids.\n\nTeacher (Y2)\n\nAileen Theron\n\nTeacher (Y2)\n\nTeacher (Y3)\n\nMel Halatokoua\n\nTeacher – Year 3\n\nWhaea Mel joined our team in term 2 of 2024 to cover Kiri who is on Maternity leave.

It has been a pleasure to join the school community as a teacher. I enjoy relating to teenagers and consider it a privilege to be able to teach in an environment where Jesus is central to life, learning, faith, community and growth.\n\nOne of the main scriptures that energises my teaching is Colossians 2:3,\n\n“In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”\n\nNCEA Principal's Nominee, Teacher - Mathematics & Physics\n\nDr Bronwyn Boddy\n\nI joined the Cornerstone staff in 2015, after teaching at Queen Elizabeth College since 2009. I am excited to be a part of the growing secondary area of the school in Mathematics and using my skills in the running of the Student Management System, KAMAR.\n\nMy favourite moments in teaching are helping students make the connections to become confident and independent learners.\n\nAside from teaching and caring for my two young daughters, I love being a part of church worship teams on Sundays, and also play the flute in a local orchestra and flute/piano for musical theatre shows.\n\nHOD English, Teacher (Y7-13)\n\nNatasha Casey\n\nI have been teaching since 2002 and at have been at Cornerstone since 2017. The move to this school has opened up many opportunities for me to learn and grow in my craft of teaching but also to grow my leadership skills.\n\nAs Assistant Principal, I am passionate about supporting teachers; helping them to grow and improve in their teaching practice at their pace. Our teachers are the experts at the coal face and need to feel as if they have room to experiment, trial, and be brave in seeking the best pathways for their students to learn. This is what we do so well here at Cornerstone.\n\nIt is a great pleasure to use my skills and abilities to extend God’s kingdom in Palmerston North.\n\nTeacher in Charge - Performing Arts\n\nMichael Doody\n\nMichael Doody here!\n\nMy role is to grow the Performing Arts at Cornerstone Christian School. I am Teacher in Charge of Music, Drama and Dance. I am grateful to be in this position where I can build up the Performing Arts at the school and can give back from my passion for singing, dancing and acting.\n\nWhy I back the Arts? Performing Arts is a very powerful tool which allows people to exercise their creativity, expressing their thoughts and feelings in a unique way, and to be able to tell the stories of ourselves and others. Also, in this school, the Performing Arts help us to find out a little bit more about our students’ DNA and who they are in Christ. Something that was said to me at drama school that has stuck with me is “Nothing to prove, only to share!”\n\nOutside of teaching, I reside with my wife and two young sons.\n\nTeacher - Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics (Y7-13)\n\nAnna Fletcher\n\nI am passionate about teaching, especially helping students to develop enjoyment, skills and understanding for the world of Science and Chemistry that God created for us. My role is to help your children learn and grow to be the best person that they can be.\n\nI grew up in Lower Hutt and attended Sacred Heart College before moving to Palmerston North to complete my Science degree majoring in Chemistry and Mathematics. I taught Science and Chemistry at Palmerston North Boys’ High School from 2006 and I started teaching at Cornerstone Christian School in 2018.\n\nMy husband and I are blessed to be active parents to three young children. When I find some free time, I enjoy playing football, being outside and reading a good book.\n\nAssistant Principal - Middle School (Y7-10), HOD Maths\n\nIan Groube\n\nAssistant Principal – Middle School (Years 7-10), Head of Department for Maths\n\nKia ora koutou,\n\nBefore Cornerstone, I taught Mathematics for the past ten years at Feilding High School. I have also taught at Totara College in Dannevirke. I have always been passionate about Mathematics and I love teaching our young people how to problem solve using math skills. I am a firm believer that hard work is far more rewarding than luck.\n\nI was a student Te Aute College, and from there I joined the Navy. I was the ship’s logistics manager, so numbers have always been a part of me. I am married to Heidi and we have three children: Courtney, Campbell and Devon.\n\nI am looking forward to being part of the school’s growth, and to what God has in store for me. I also look forward to the different aspects Cornerstone Christian School will bring into my life and how my experiences and skills will be utilised to enhance the school.\n\nESOL Coordinator\n\nChristina Havill\n\nESOL Learning Support Coordinator (Y7-13), ESOL Teacher\n\nMy husband and I moved to Palmerston North and we are really enjoying our environment. Our daughter, Samantha, is at this school and we are so excited to have her part of the Cornerstone community too!\n\nFor the last four years we lived in Brunei Darussalam where I taught English (Years 7-10) in the local secondary schools. This was a very rewarding and enriching life experience. Prior to that I taught in the Kingsway Middle School Department in Auckland for seven years. I was a Year Seven Homeroom Teacher in charge of Performing Arts for all the Year 7-9 students. I also taught English, Mathematics and Social Studies.\n\nIt is exciting to be back in Christian education and I consider it a privilege to teach from a biblical worldview.\n\nAssistant Principal (Y11-13), HOD Science\n\nHayden Hewitt\n\nAssistant Principal (Y11-13), HOD Science, Teacher (Science, Biology)\n\nI joined the Cornerstone Christian School community at the beginning of 2017. Prior to this I have taught Science and Biology for ten years, including a year teaching in the UK. Before teaching, I worked for as number of years as a Science Technician at Massey University and within the dairy industry.\n\nI am passionate about Science, and its relevance to all of us in our everyday lives. I love the way that we can see the Glory of God displayed in everything from the complexity of a single cell, through to the beauty and vastness of space.\n\nI am inspired by the idea that the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled. In my teaching, I hope to stoke the fires of interest and curiosity about the amazing world around us. I love being part of an enthusiastic and committed staff here at Cornerstone Christian School and belonging to the wider school community.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my wife and children, and cooking and eating food – especially dishes from other countries. I love being outdoors in God’s good creation, and I’m a keen deer stalker and fisherman.\n\nDirector of Pastoral Care, Teacher (PE)\n\nLouis Jayasuriya\n\nI have been teaching PE and Health since 2007, both in New Zealand and in the United Kingdom.\n\nI live in Palmerston North with my wife Emma and children Noah, Eliza and Harriet. I lead the pastoral care and PB4L teams at CCS as well as heading up the PE and Health curriculum areas. I enjoying playing sport, coaching sports teams and sharing my passion with my students.\n\nOne of the key themes I promote in my teaching is that the students and myself as the teacher are in our education journey together as a team, because together we can succeed. The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team – Phil Jackson\n\nTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their labour – Ecclesiastes 4:9-10\n\nRobotics Teacher, IT Manager/Support\n\nPaul Jorgensen\n\nI began teaching at Cornerstone Christian School in 2016. Prior to this, I have gained experience at three other high schools in the Manawatu area and one in Wellington. My teaching areas include Digital Technology and Robotics. I have a real passion for teaching and am committed to journeying with the students as they develop their own passions and identity in Christ.\n\nI am also responsible for all things IT at Cornerstone; this provides a satisfying balance to my teaching workload. I have enjoyed carrying out a variety of projects to improve the level of equipment, the systems and the confidence of staff and students with each of these.\n\nI count it an absolute privilege to be involved in Christian education and to serve the wider community as our school carries out its mission to equip our students to become confident followers of Jesus Christ to impact their world.\n\nPE Teacher (Y7-13)\n\nLeanne Mark\n\nTeacher (Y7-13) – PE, Sports Studies, Health\n\nHi!\n\nI have been teaching Physical Education to high school students since 1995. When I began teaching I was employed at Nga Tawa Diocesan School for Girls. I then taught at Palmerston North Girls High School, Carnot Independent School for Girls and, in 2021, I finished six years’ teaching at Queen Elizabeth College.\n\nI like the saying: “If you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life.” This is how I feel about teaching PE. I’m looking forward to continuing my love of teaching Physical Education here at CCS.\n\nLeanne Mark\n\nTeacher (Y7-13) Y9 Homeroom\n\nNicolene Marx\n\nTeacher (Y7-13), Y9 Homeroom, English, Health, Physical Education\n\nIn December 2018, a two-year process came to a fast forward when my husband received a job offer in Palmy. Six weeks later, our family of arrived here on our first ever trip abroad!\n\nWe are truly blessed to be here doing what we love: inspiring through teaching and coaching.\n\nMy teaching career started in 2011 teaching English and Social Science while playing first class cricket. I was fortunate to share my passion for sport through not only co-ordinating sport but also coaching several school netball and cricket teams. I have been teaching at Cornerstone since 2019.\n\nI believe that God has a plan with where we are, and I am excited for what He has in store for us within Cornerstone and the broader community in His greater plan.\n\nDirector of Tribes & Events, Teacher (Y7)\n\nCraig McDonald\n\nDirector of Tribes and Events, Teacher (Y7)\n\nKia ora\n\nMy name is Craig McDonald and I reside in G block as a Y7 teacher when I’m not being involved in the organisation of sports and tribes around the school.\n\nI have taught every year group in the primary school, with no firm favourite level, just some interesting memories!\n\nOver half of my teaching experience has been in Christian Schooling. I do my best to integrate our Christian Faith with what we are learning in the classroom about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nAs well as my teaching diploma, I have a Bachelor’s degree in Education focusing on Christian Schooling, and a Theology degree. These are helping me to form my ideas about how to achieve a successful Christian Education.\n\nHomeroom Teacher (Y8). Music\n\nDavid Papworth\n\nI began teaching at Cornerstone Christian school at the beginning of 2020. Before beginning my teaching career, I undertook a degree majoring in History at Massey University before completing a teaching diploma.\n\nI believe strongly that education and spiritual growth are intertwined, and to develop a young individual with the core values of Respect, Diligence, Integrity, Kindness and Humility before God is of the utmost importance. Cornerstone is a place where I have found welcoming and loving staff, students who care for each other and work as a team to better themselves, and an atmosphere of love and respect.\n\nOutside of school, I am always involving myself with as much music as I possibly can. Writing, performing, and using it as a medium for worship are my biggest passion. I also love the outdoors, and particularly getting out on the water wherever possible.\n\nLet the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts.\n\nColossians 3:16\n\nWhakapono (Y7-8) Team Leader\n\nTarryn Rose\n\nMy name is Tarryn Rose and my family consists of my husband James (who is also a teacher), our two boys and our dog Jack. Palmerston North is my home city, but I have also lived in Whanganui, Africa and the\n\nPhilippines.\n\nI began teaching almost 20 years ago after graduating from Massey University in Palmerston North. My degree was in Education and my major was in P.E. I enjoy encouraging the students with the idea we focused on in Term 4 2015: “Fit Body, Healthy Mind, Honours God”. 2016 is my second year at Cornerstone and I look forward to all that it holds for the Whakapono Team. The Year 7/8s have a fabulous year ahead, with some of the highlights being: sharing and hearing God’s word in our team assemblies, camp at Vertical Horizon, sports events, celebrations, classes with specialist teachers here at Cornerstone.\n\nSecondary Dean, Careers Advisor, Teacher\n\nNate Sextus\n\nI began teaching at Cornerstone at the beginning of 2020. Before then, I had a range of teaching experience within the private education sector and then went on to teach technology at a state school. I am Palmy proud, having been born and raised here. I attended school and Massey University here and went on to study through Bethlehem Tertiary Institute (BTI). It is exciting to be at Cornerstone Christian School as I can bring my whole mind and heart to the role!\n\nI am passionate about worship and regularly lead worship at my local church. Most of all, I have a beautiful wife and I am proud father of a young baby girl!\n\nJohn 1:16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.\n\nSecondary Dean, Teacher in Charge (Junior Science)\n\nSarah Sisson\n\nI have been part of the Cornerstone team since 2018. I live here in the Kelvin Grove community with my husband and 2 girls who also attend CCS.\n\nI love teaching and inspiring young budding scientists! I am passionate about helping students observe the world around them and opening their eyes to the miracles of Creation. I am especially interested in developing their literacy and critical thinking skills which will benefit them through their lives. I also consider it a privilege to help students navigate the challenges they face through my role as a Secondary School Dean.\n\n“Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: who created these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one is missing” (Isaiah 40:26 (NIV))\n\nDirector of Life Lab, HOD Art\n\nDr Erika Snedden\n\nI joined the Cornerstone Community in 2015 to establish and develop the Secondary Art Department. Since 2017 I have been the Director of Life Lab – responsible for facilitating Christian discipleship, life direction and academic mentoring programmes for the secondary students. I have also had the privilege of establishing and leading our Duke of Edinburgh’s Hillary Award Scheme.\n\nWithin New Zealand and overseas I have had experience as a Secondary Art and Art History teacher and Head of Department.\n\nAs an A/r/tographer – artist, researcher and teacher, I have a passion to support and development research inquiry within learning communities.\n\nAt the core of my leadership style, practice and faith is a belief in allowing and empowering others to lead.\n\nHomeroom Teacher (Y7), Dance & Drama\n\nNarrelle Soong\n\nKia ora,\n\nI am privileged to be teaching Y7 at Cornerstone Christian School. My teaching focus is to create a student centred and collaborative learning environment that fosters independent and innovative learners who are passionate about their mahi and growing their God connection.\n\nI grew up attending Christian schools and began my teaching journey at Totara College, Dannevirke. In London for 10 years, I taught in several private schools and a 6th form college before returning to Aotearoa to be close to family in Palmerston North. I have taught new entrants through to Y8 and have enjoyed being a performing arts teacher at primary and secondary levels. Taking time out of classroom teaching, I completed full time dance and Pilates training in London.\n\nMy husband Matt and I live in Kelvin Grove with our children, Sebastien, India and Ambrose.\n\nNarrelle\n\nTeacher (Y7-13)\n\nDonna Murray\n\nTeacher (Y7-13) – Y9 Homeroom, Science, Mathematics\n\nDonna joined our staff in June 2023.

More details to come.\n\nTeacher in Charge - Social Sciences\n\nJoanna Wamala\n\nTeacher (Y7-13) – TIC – Social Sciences, Year 10 Homeroom, Geography, Social Studies\n\nI began my teaching journey in 1999 at a large co-ed Auckland Secondary School teaching Geography and Social Studies. After about 5 years serving there, I answered the call to missions with an initial 6 month trip to The Joshua Foundation in Tanzania, to help with teaching teachers at Joshua Teachers Training College. In 2020, 16 years later, I returned to New Zealand with a husband, three children, a master’s degree, a passion for Chrisitan Education and my bags full of rich experiences.\n\nMy family and I have recently relocated to Palmerston North so that I can return to my first love, teaching Geography and Social Studies here at Cornerstone Christian School. I am excited to be able to re-introduce Geography to the options list and help students open their eyes to the wonders of God’s rich and diverse creation.\n\nTeacher in Charge - Commerce\n\nMariam Karimee\n\nTeacher in Charge – Commerce, Accounting & Business Studies\n\nMariam joined our CCS staff at the start of 2024 – more info to come\n\nTeacher (Y7-13)\n\nJohan Oelofse\n\nTeacher (Y7-13), Kaitiaki Y7-10, Y10 Homeroom, Digitech, Robotics, Woodtech, Equip, Mathematics\n\nSupport staff – Learning Support\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nSuseela Batchelor\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nMy name is Suseela.\n\nPalmerston North has been home for me and my family since 2004. Originally, I was from Malaysia. I live with my kiwi husband, two amazing children and a dog named Coco.\n\nI have been part of the Cornerstone community since 2013, when my children were enrolled at the school. I have been privileged to work with amazing children and teenagers previously as a social worker.\n\nChildren ministry has been my favourite and the highlight of my work over the years. Big or small, do it with love.\n\nI’m excited to step into my role as a teacher aide at Cornerstone Christian School.\n\nSuseela\n\nTeacher Aide & Sports Coordinator\n\nJannell Eade\n\nTeacher Aide & Extra Curricular Sports Coordinator\n\nI am very fortunate to have two roles here at Cornerstone. I am a special needs teacher aide and also the sports coordinator. These two roles encompass my two passions. I love being on the learning journey with the special young children I work with; witnessing their challenges, growth and achievements. I am rewarded daily with their accomplishments.\n\nSport is a massive part of my life too. I thrive on coaching, organising and encouraging students to explore all of the life lessons they can learn by participating\n\nin team and individual sports. Our vision for sport at Cornerstone is to see the majority of our students involve themselves in a sport, in any capacity. We are fast becoming a very competitive Manawatu school in the sporting arena.\n\nI love working in such a supportive, positive and encouraging school.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nBarbara Hembrow\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nI have been a teacher aide since 2011, after spending many hours as a parent in the classroom and in various school activities.\n\nMy journey with Cornerstone started in 1996, when my daughter and, later, my son attended the Preschool in the Life Church crèche. I became involved with the fundraising group and learned how to parent help at the preschool, in new entrants and made my way up through the school years. My older children laugh because, although they still see themselves as Cornerstone Children, they have left school yet their Mum still has to go every day! My youngest child is in secondary at Cornerstone, so our Cornerstone story has not yet ended.\n\nI completed a Teacher Aide certificate in 2013. I assist teachers in classrooms from Year 1 to Year 10, helping students who need extra support with literacy and numeracy.\n\nI love how Christ is in every part of our day at school and how each child is celebrated as a special gift from God.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nMaria McDonald\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nMy name is Maria McDonald. I am truly privileged to be able to work in an environment where Jesus Christ is at the centre. It is exciting to see Jesus working\n\ndaily in the children’s lives.\n\nI enjoy working alongside amazing staff members to make a difference in the lives of these young people and seeing their abilities grow and develop.\n\nTeacher aide\n\nDaniel McGaffin\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nThis is my first time ever being a teacher aide and I am very excited to have my first opportunity here at Cornerstone. I look forward to be working in an environment where God is at the center of everything whether its teaching or relational. I have a background in working with youth and in a Christian context, youth development to a small degree. I have spent 10 years as a youth leader at my home church CCC and I have also headed up a Leaders in Training programme at the El Rancho kids camps where I helped junior high school aged youth learn about themselves, who they are in God and leading at kids camps.\n\nI started a curiosity in teacher aiding last year while I was a lifeguard at Freyberg Pool. There I had some exposure to their learning support department when students would come in for swims. I enjoy getting to know students in learning support, figuring out what makes them tick and how to clearly relate with each one. In a big picture view, I just love to see youth start to figure out who they are and what God has given them, and to see them free in that and enjoy who they are.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nAnne-Marie Mitchell\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nWhat an awesome privilege to be a part of the Cornerstone Christian School community!\n\nI have been working as a special needs teacher aide since 2014 and find it exciting and fulfilling to help and encourage children both in their education and in developing to their full potential in God!\n\nTeacher aide\n\nKatie Monaghan\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nI am currently studying a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in Education at Massey University here in Palmerston North. I plan to do a post grad of teaching to get my teaching certificate and be able to be a primary school teacher. Currently, I am a teacher aide at Cornerstone and I’m loving every second of it. The kids are awesome and it’s so cool to be able to watch them grow into little superstars! I’m passionate about teaching and hope to be able to do it as a career for the rest of my life!\n\nLinda Ng\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nI am very privileged to be part of the Cornerstone community, working here as a teacher aide since November 2020.\n\nMy husband and I came from Singapore to New Zealand in 2009. We lived in Palmerston North for 6 years during which time I worked as a social worker with a child and family support service and as a teacher aide in a primary school. As much as I enjoyed the work of supporting students with special needs I decided to stop work to be a stay-at-home mother.\n\nMy initial acquaintance with Cornerstone Christian School was a very pleasant one when my daughter started attending the preschool. I was impressed with the quality of the early education provided and was happy to see Christian values and teachings being incorporated. Since then, my husband and I have become convinced that this is the direction that we want for our children’s education.\n\nIn 2015, we relocated to Taupo where we enrolled our children at a Christian school. We lived in Taupo for 5 years, and during this time I did a part-time Level 4 course in Education Support. One of the course requirements was for me to attain some teacher aide work experience, which I did by volunteering at my children’s school. I enjoyed being part of the Christian school environment and knew that this is what I would commit to do.\n\nIn October 2020, my husband found a new job in Palmerston North so we moved back to the city. We have always felt Palmerston North is our hometown and that God has opened the doors for us to return, providing for our every need. I am blessed to be given this role as a teacher aide at Cornerstone Christian School and to have this opportunity to support young people in their learning and relationship with God.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nRuth Oemcke\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nMy name is Ruth Oemcke. I have worked as a teacher aide for over 20 years and prior to that was employed as a hospice nurse. I started my journey at Cornerstone 11 years ago and in that time have found the staff to be incredibly genuine.\n\nI work with the special needs children. I have a passion to see the students excel in whatever they are able to do, helping them to increase their confidence and self-esteem. It is a privilege to work with the students. Being a mother of a daughter who has Downs syndrome, I know first-hand the importance of students being included and accepted in their school environment. I love seeing the children make progress.\n\nPatience is on the top of the list, but when breakthrough comes, even in the smallest things, it is very much celebrated. It is also a pleasure to see the children enjoying their schoolwork, especially when they’ve experienced success at whatever level; their eagerness to learn obviously increases.\n\nBecause of the school’s Special Character we are able to talk openly about Christian things, which of course involves our character and how we are to treat others. I find this a really good tool to help other children to be inclusive of the children that require a little extra help. It is always wonderful to see children independently looking out for the needs of those who struggle and encouraging them.\n\nI really do love working here. In every class I have assisted in, the teachers are so encouraging and supportive of addressing the needs of individual children. They show a real empathy for the children and are eager to see them progress and be involved in as many areas as possible.\n\nScience Technician, Teacher Aide\n\nJoy Soo\n\nTeacher Aide, Science Technician\n\nMabuhay.\n\nI moved to New Zealand from the Philippines in 2008 after getting married to a NZ-born Chinese. We have two active sons who both go to Cornerstone.\n\nI have a degree in Food Technology. After graduating, I worked as a university researcher for two years. I then moved to the food manufacturing industry and worked for more than 10 years in several companies developing products from food sauces, to reconstituted liquid creamer and other dairy based products.\n\nWhen my eldest son started school here at Cornerstone in 2014, I was very impressed with the culture of the school. There is warmth, kindness and friendliness from the school staff, the parents and the students. Now that I am part of the school, I am excited to work with a great team who work passionately towards one vision.\n\nTeacher aide\n\nRosie Irvine\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nTo be added\n\nTeacher aide\n\nSue Twigge\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nTo be added.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nAna Livai\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nMALO LELEI\n\nMy name is Ana Falesiva Livai also known as (aka) Mrs Muli. Our last name was officially changed at the beginning of this year to the correct family name as Livai, so our first last name is now a middle name for everyone.\n\nI am a Tongan and a mother to 8 children who have all been at Cornerstone Christian School. The 3 older ones have left school, which leaves me with 4 at High School and 1 at Primary School.\n\nMy first engagement with the school was when my firstborn started in 2007 when the school was only at A to D Block.\n\nI was a secondary teacher before I migrated to New Zealand in 1998 under the Skills Category. I have a Bachelor of Education from Massey University but have been a full-time mother for my 8 blessings.\n\nI have been blessed to be part of the ESOL team to help bridge the language barrier of our migrating students, as well as to be a Tongan Cultural mentor, to assist in navigating the many cultural differences at school and to be an impact on our student’s lives at present and in the future.\n\nFood Technician\n\nKate French\n\nFood Technician\n\nKate has joined our Food Technology department as a food technician in 2023. More details to come.\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nLaura Nicholson\n\nTeacher Aide\n\nLaura joined our support staff team as a teacher aide in July 2023.

I loved growing up and learning in such a wonderful, faith filled and learning focused environment and am thrilled to be on the other side helping students learn, serve and grow in God.\n\nI am also currently interning at my church, mainly focusing on toddlers and youth ministry, which is a lot of fun and I’m learning so much.\n\nI have a great passion for working with kids and seeing them grow and want to study early childhood education in the future.\n\nSupport staff – Administration, Grounds, Library\n\nLibrarian\n\nKatharine Bracey\n\nLibrarian\n\nI enjoy books and reading, and I started working in the school library on a voluntary basis in 2008. It was located in A1, the useable collection was tiny, and there were many books awaiting processing. The school had no one with the time and skills to do this. I had learned to catalogue books using the same library software as a volunteer at Freyberg High School. This was great for everyone: Mrs Jane Barker could buy more books knowing they would make it into the library, the students were able to read them and I had a part-time job!\n\nI have seen the library move from A1 to the new Administration building and then on to G2. I look forward to returning the books to The Learning Centre in the Administration building.\n\nIn 2014, the foundation of the Secondary collection was a major emphasis for book purchases, together with requested items such as Geronimo Stilton, Lego books, the Brick Bible, Asterix and the Tintin series of graphic novels. My thanks goes to Anathea Jackson who, on a voluntary basis, has been reducing the time lag between books being purchased and arriving on our library shelves through 2014/2015.\n\nIn 2015, the emphasis has been on novels for the Tumanako and Whakapono students; many of these have been requested by staff or students.\n\nI have been in the school long enough to see individual children’s reading abilities and tastes change as they mature. It is great to see children eager to read and to see their delight when books they suggested make it to the shelves.\n\nTeacher Aide & Sports Coordinator\n\nJannell Eade\n\nTeacher Aide & Extra Curricular Sports Coordinator\n\nI am very fortunate to have two roles here at Cornerstone. I am a special needs teacher aide and also the sports coordinator. These two roles encompass my two passions. I love being on the learning journey with the special young children I work with; witnessing their challenges, growth and achievements. I am rewarded daily with their accomplishments.\n\nSport is a massive part of my life too. I thrive on coaching, organising and encouraging students to explore all of the life lessons they can learn by participating\n\nin team and individual sports. Our vision for sport at Cornerstone is to see the majority of our students involve themselves in a sport, in any capacity. We are fast becoming a very competitive Manawatu school in the sporting arena.\n\nI love working in such a supportive, positive and encouraging school.\n\nPrincipal's PA\n\nRebecca Jorgensen\n\nPrincipal’s PA\n\nCornerstone for the Jorgensen’s has always been a family affair and our heart is well entrenched here.\n\nOur two boys have been all through preschool and school (both now out in the world as adults). I have worked here previously as a Teacher Aide both in the classroom and as an ESOL Teacher Aide for 9 years, before taking a 3-year break to work on other things.\n\nMy husband Paul is the ‘IT guy’ here and I am so excited to be working at CCS again, this time as the Principal’s PA. Working in the admin team and being organised is a really good fit for me – in fact, our family like to refer to it as being ‘Jorganised’.\n\nI love how God continually brings all the different parts of our life experiences together in ways that we never would have imagined earlier in our journey. I feel God has called me to be here at this time, for His purpose. His timing is always perfect and I feel so grateful that He is in control.\n\nGroundsman\n\nEric Knowlton\n\nGroundsman\n\nCaretaker\n\nKevin Randall\n\nCaretaker\n\nI am a South African who has been living in New Zealand for almost 14 years. It has been absolutely awesome! I am 10 years happily married to a cute Kiwi girl and we have a gorgeous 7-year old son called Joshua, who is also here at Cornerstone.\n\nI joined Cornerstone Christian School as its new caretaker in December 2018. Little did I know that I would be going to school each and every day with my son Joshua! Just as Almighty God, in the beginning, created a garden and put Adam in it as his caretaker, I feel that I have the privilege of taking care of His property here at Cornerstone.\n\nPlease pray for me as I will be praying for you too!\n\nEnrolment Registrar\n\nSarndra Rauzi\n\nCCET Executive Officer, Enrolment Registrar, Proprietor’s appointee\n\nI joined Cornerstone’s staff in 2014, having previously been involved for many years as a parent and volunteer. It was a privilege to be involved in many areas of school life as a volunteer whilst my children were there and I am very thankful for many wonderful Christian teachers who taught, prayed for and influenced my family during those years.\n\nAfter working for eight years’ in the role of Principal’s PA, in which I was also involved with enrolments, I moved sideways to focus mostly on enrolments and also took up a part-time role with the Proprietor.\n\nCornerstone has an exciting vision and I enjoy being part of an organisation that seeks to partner with parents to help children “to be[come] confident followers of Jesus Christ, equipped and inspired to creatively impact our world.”\n\nExecutive Officer\n\nVicki Scoggins\n\nExecutive Officer (Finance, Payroll), Property Manager\n\nVicki trained as a primary school teacher in 1984, teaching for a couple of years in Wellington schools before having her family.\n\nShe retrained in the finance field, graduating in 2001 and has worked in various organisations as an Accounting Technician, from Chartered accountants, corporate (Zespri), private industry (timber mill and Maori trusts). Her first venture into the incredibly unique finance side of education was in 2020 when she joined the team at Cornerstone Christian School and she is still learning.\n\nVicki is our Executive Officer looking after payroll and finance.\n\nStudent Administration Officer\n\nIlona Shewell\n\nStudent Administration Officer\n\nI am originally from South Africa. My family and I have started a wonderful new life in New Zealand. We were blessed to have our two boys accepted into Cornerstone. We as a family have felt truly welcome and accepted.\n\nMy path at Cornerstone started with me being a Teacher aide. I absolutely loved being within the classroom environment and being involved with the students. When the position for student administrator became available, I knew that I had to apply, as my background is in administration. I had the best of both worlds available to me, administration and still being involved with the students. I feel as though I have found where I am meant to be. I am truly blessed to be part of an amazing team at Cornerstone.\n\nAs a mother of two boys that attend Cornerstone, I can honestly say that as a family we are truly blessed to be part of the school family. The school has provided my children with the Christian values that are so important to us as a family. It is a blessing to see how they have both grown as Christians and as individuals.\n\nMy position as student administrator provides me with the opportunity to meet not only the students, but also their families. I have the privilege of being one of the staff members that can first welcome new students and their families to the Cornerstone Christian school family. It is a truly humbling experience to see so many families walking down the same Christian path, wanting to instill the same Christian values.\n\nAdministration Officer\n\nCheri Yates\n\nAdministration Officer\n\nI have been part of the Cornerstone Christian School community as a parent since 2005. My five children have all attended both the preschool and the school, with the younger two still attending school here.\n\nI joined the staff as Administration Officer in January 2022 and I am excited to be part of a dedicated team, serving and supporting our school community.\n\nWe are truly blessed with the calibre of leadership and teachers we have, amazing people who are passionate about both educating and discipling our children.\n\nI am passionate about our school and the values we strive to attain; Respect, Diligence, Integrity, Kindness and Humility before God.\n\nCleaner\n\nSue Hill\n\nCleaner, Library Assistant (volunteer)\n\nCleaner\n\nKaren Watson-Lammas\n\nCleaner\n\nCaretaker\n\nTim Gowan\n\nCaretaker\n\nTim has joined our staff as a Caretaker in May 2023.\n\nCleaner\n\nJessie Watson-Compton\n\nCleaner\n\nSchool Board and Proprietors\n\nElected Parent Board Member\n\nBraden Simpson\n\nPresiding Member of the School Board\n\nMy name is Braden Simpson and I have been a Board parent trustee for the past six years .\n\nI have been a Christian since my late teens I am part of the Crossroads church community, serving on a worship team and leading a Life Group. I am married to Raeleen Simpson, the AP for Primary at Cornerstone, and have three children at the school at intermediate, and secondary levels. I have been involved with school sport, camps, and making large numbers of coffees for the gala.\n\nI am a Principal Software Engineer for a Sydney-based company and have a degree in Computer Science. I have several years’ experience on the Board of PSSM (Postal Sunday School Movement), in addition to the school Board, and have a good understanding of Board processes and procedures. I have learnt much from my time on the Board about the ‘ins-and-outs’ of school governance and wish to carry this through the next three-year term.\n\nI believe the Cornerstone Christian School Board needs to have a clear vision of God’s purpose for the school and community and I have certainly experienced this over the last six years. The prayerful consideration of Board matters and a sense of unity in Christ have been a hallmark of the current Board and I pray that this will continue.\n\nElected Parent Board Member\n\nPaul Yates\n\nParent Representative to the School Board\n\nMy name is Paul Yates. I am passionate about Christian Education and our school specifically. I have previously served on the Board for 2 consecutive terms (2007-2013) and experienced the tangible benefits of a solid, focused governance team.\n\nHaving had three of our children benefit from our school environment and pass on to adulthood and work life, with another two being current students, you could say that Cheri and I have a lot invested and also had great returns from being part of the school community.\n\nA point to note is that the role as Parent Trustee involves separating yourself from any personal grievance or agenda and focusing solely on the overarching governance of the school. The different personal viewpoints held on the board add to the richness of discussion but the focus must remain on the school as a whole and the students and their development specifically.\n\nElected Parent Board Member\n\nErin Reid\n\nParent Representative to the School Board\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am Erin Reid. I am mum to five boys, four of whom will be at Cornerstone by the end of\n\n2022. I am married to Ian Reid who is the pastor at Kings Grace Presbyterian Church\n\nhere in Palmy and who teaches Cornerstone’s senior kids on behalf of Emmaus.\n\nI am a Chiropractor specialising in paediatrics and am passionate about seeing children\n\nthrive, physically, nutritionally and emotionally and spiritually in the good bodies God has\n\ngiven them. My main reason for being a parent trustee for the Cornerstone Board is a desire to\n\nsee Cornerstone’s special character as a Christian School maintained and safe guarded\n\nfor the long term. We have a unique and wonderful school and I would love to see it thrive\n\nand protected, especially in the current political climate, by being proactive rather than\n\nreactive.\n\nPrincipal\n\nChris Mitchell\n\nPrincipal\n\nNau mai, haere mai ki te te kura o Ihu Karaiti te Kamaka!\n\nIt is an honour and a privilege to be a teacher and educational leader here at Cornerstone Christian School. I can honestly say that I have spent the last twenty years doing my dream job – teaching students across the wider Manawatu region – five of those as Teaching-Principal at Awahou School in the Pohangina Valley, and here at Cornerstone Christian School since mid-2008. In 2016, I was appointed to the position of Deputy Principal and in January 2020 I assumed the role of Acting Principal.\n\nAs a school, we tend to focus on the holistic development of each child – or to put it more simply, their ‘discipleship’. I believe that discipleship is simply learning to live the way that God wants us to live and I love being part of this process in our students’ lives. Ultimately our key desire is that every Cornerstone student comes to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and develops their own relationship with God. We have a strong character development focus with an emphasis on our values of respect, diligence, kindness and integrity with an underpinning value of humility before God. Although our children achieve highly in their academic education and our school achieves excellent results on a national level, I believe that it is more important to focus on their developing character than their academic grades. In our modern world, learning can occur wherever and whenever you like, but good character develops when you are young, so that is our focus; good grades, and achieving to one’s best, are a natural outflow of developing good character.\n\nOn a personal level, I am married to Anne-Marie Mitchell who is also on staff here at Cornerstone Christian School as a teacher aide. Together we have four grown-up daughters – two of whom are also teachers here in Palmerston North. When not in school you will find me gardening or looking after our lifestyle block just out of Ashhurst; casting a fly for trout down at some local river or walking the hills with a pack on my back.\n\nMy office door is usually open and I love meeting people in our wider Cornerstone family. Please drop in and say hello if you are over near the administration office or if you see me wandering around the school grounds.\n\nNgā mihi nui\n\nProprietor's Appointee\n\nRichard Tankersley\n\nCCET Chairperson\n\nRichard is the Chairperson for the Cornerstone Christian Education Trust, our Proprietors for CCS.\n\nProprietor's Appointee\n\nSimon McCracken\n\nProprietor’s Appointee\n\nProprietor's Appointee\n\nGlenn de Groot\n\nProprietor’s Appointee\n\nMy name is Glenn De Groot and I have the privilege of being on the School Board as a Proprietor appointee.\n\nI am married to Treena and we have three adult children who went through the complete Cornerstone School system from preschool to Year 13.\n\nMy love and appreciation for Christian education grew as our family got more involved with Cornerstone. I joined the Fundraising Group, helped organise a few Galas, ran the fruit and vege stall and other events, and then was elected as a Parent Representative on the School Board.\n\nAfter a few terms, I was invited to join the Proprietors (Cornerstone Christian Education Trust) and have loved working alongside some amazing and passionate people with a huge love for our God and the community and who are incredible visionaries.\n\nI find it such a pleasure to serve the Cornerstone School Community, and we are very blessed with the awesome teaching staff and leadership team.\n\nTupuranga (Y9/10) Team Leader, Within School Lead, Teacher\n\nKarina Anderson\n\nMy family and I moved from the Kapiti Coast to Palmerston North last year because we wanted our girls to attend Cornerstone Christian School. It has been a pleasure to join the school community as a teacher. I enjoy relating to teenagers and consider it a privilege to be able to teach in an environment where Jesus is central to life, learning, faith, community and growth.\n\nOne of the main scriptures that energises my teaching is Colossians 2:3,\n\n“In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”\n\nSchool Board - Parent representative\n\nGena Toa\n\nParent representative to the School Board\n\nGena joined our CCS School Board as a parent representative in 2023.\n\nSchool Board - Parent representative\n\nShane Casey\n\nParent representative to the School Board\n\nShane joined our school board as a parent representative in 2023.\n\nStudent Board Representative\n\nRuby Hewitt\n\nStudent Board Representative\n\nRuby is our Y13 student representative on the school board for 2024.\n\nEnrolment Registrar\n\nSarndra Rauzi\n\nCCET Executive Officer, Enrolment Registrar, Proprietor’s appointee\n\nI joined Cornerstone’s staff in 2014, having previously been involved for many years as a parent and volunteer.
