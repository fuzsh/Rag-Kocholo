        "text": "How LGBTQ+ Disabled People Are Celebrating Virtual Pride\n\nContent note: includes mentions of COVID-19 and police brutality toward Black people\n\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many in-person Pride events have been postponed or turned virtual. And while I do miss the experience of dressing in an all-rainbow outfit and celebrating in person with my friends—especially because a few of my close friends have come out since in the last year—the move to virtual events offers an opportunity for increased accessibility as long as organizers commit to hosting accessible virtual gatherings. A virtual Pride offers a safe space where police are not present like they often are at Pride parades and events. And celebrating Pride from home opens up opportunities to disabled LGBTQ+ folks who may have been unable to participate in a traditional Pride event because of access issues.\n\nA virtual Pride may look different from an in-person Pride, but this year, many LGBTQ+ disabled people are excited about the ways they plan to honor the 50th anniversary of Pride.\n\n“This is my first pride out,” explains Keah Brown, author and noted bisexual icon, “and so it was always going to be special and mean so much to me! I’m hoping to celebrate with my social media followers and post pictures in Pride related looks and acknowledge that virtually is just as valid.” In 2017, Keah Brown started the viral hashtag #DisabledAndCute, so she’s well-versed in celebrating self-love online.\n\nLike Keah, I plan to post photos of Pride attire that I would have worn to in-person events, even if my friends and I had just decided to get together and have a very queer walk in the woods like we did last year. I bought a rainbow flower crown (inspired by one of my favorite authors, Anna-Marie McLemore) and asked my wife Macey to take photos of me in my colorful outfit with my purple cane decked out in glitter. I’m grateful that I won’t have to factor accessibility into my decision to attend Boston’s Pride events, which have historically not been the best at this.\n\nNoor Pervez, Accessibility Director at Majid al Rabia, feels similarly. “Virtual Pride for me means being able to celebrate Pride with members of my community from home, even if I’m having trouble moving,” he says.\n\nNoor will be celebrating Pride with Masjid Al Rabia online, starting with a PrEid (celebrating Pride and Eid) open mic online and attending Dallas Pride virtually, which will take away some of the stress of flying as a wheelchair user. The PrEid events Noor is participating in center and celebrate LGBTQ+ Muslims. He says, “These in-community events remind me that I exist, that my community is real and strong despite attacks against it. It affirms that we are here and always have been.”\n\nMarlena Chertock, a writer from Washington, D.C., was excited to participate in the Unicorn March’s first Bi History Month, which she says celebrates “people whose experiences are often erased.” Marlena followed the hashtag on Twitter and says, “The outpouring of support moved me to share a poem I’ve been working on for a while, called ‘Where the quiet queers are,’ inspired by Hannah Gadsby’s comedy performance Nanette.”\n\nVirtual Pride actions can be intentional in including people who are often erased at traditional modern Pride festivals or in LGBTQ+ media. I watched Remixing the Rainbow, a virtual panel from The Bronx Book Festival that centers queer and trans authors of color with Dhonielle Clayton, George M. Johnson, Arvin Ahmadi, and Aiden Thomas, moderated by Patrice Caldwell, and I’m reading You Should See Me in a Crown by Leah Johnson.\n\nAs a sensory-seeking autistic person, I will genuinely miss the rich sensory experience of attending Pride, so I’m planning to honor my autistic identity all month alongside my LGBTQ+ identity as if June is an extension of Autism Acceptance Month. That means stimming and dancing to Lizzo and Demi Lovato songs in my flower crown and reading and sharing work by other autistic LGBTQ+ folks.\n\nMarisa Russello, a mental health advocate and writer from New York, will also miss the ability to attend Pride in person but says that one major accessibility barrier for her is that cigarette smoke is a trigger for her migraines, and smoking is common at Pride events. Many Pride events are also not fragrance-free, making them inaccessible to people with chemical sensitivities and allergies. “There are so many benefits to virtual meetings as far as accessibility,” Marisa says. “They eliminate transportation as a barrier, so I can attend NYC Pride events even though I no longer live there. I could even attend Pride events worldwide.”\n\nPride can also be an important time to honor the history of Stonewall and the legacy of Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and other trans people of color who led the movement. “The first Pride was a riot for rights and a recent generation endured the AIDS crisis—supporting those in the community who are most at risk during the pandemic, and honoring ourselves, pays homage to our history in a powerful way,” explains Taylor Linloff, an autistic advocate from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, who will participate in celebrations and parties but also in community action events such as cards being mailed to isolated LGBTQ+ people. That’s why I’ve recognized Pride so far by donating to LGBTQ+ Black-led social justice organizations and mutual aid funds and organizing a Q&A with trans authors for the We Need Diverse Books blog.\n\nLinloff also plans to host a Facebook Live talking about their experiences as a gay person who was diagnosed with autism later in life, and says they’re looking forward to feeling at home again during Pride Month. “Pride makes me so happy, and I love seeing everyone come alive and being so unashamedly who they are,” they say. “Virtual does not mean fake or imaginary in the case of Pride, it’s just reimagined. More opportunities to get creative, and who doesn’t like an inspired challenge?”\n\nExisting and celebrating as a multiply marginalized LGBTQ+ disabled person can be very powerful. “I’m going to try to celebrate with the small pockets of joy that I find,” says Keah Brown. “Especially with what’s going on in the world in terms of the brutal killings of Black people, joy is even that much more important so I’ll celebrate by fighting for equality and justice for my people.”\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

Even event organizers and activists who normally work to make sure their in-person events are accessible seem to forget that virtual events need to be accessible for the disability community, too. Data from the Pew Research Center shows that disabled people are actually much less likely to use the internet, which may be in part because inaccessibility remains a serious barrier. So, let’s break down this barrier. Accessibility for virtual events should be a priority and central to the planning process from the beginning.\n\nPlanning your virtual event\n\nConsider where and how your virtual events are taking place\n\nAs a starting point, think about the scope of your virtual event and what platform you plan to host it on. Disabled people are twice as likely to be unemployed or live in poverty, and internet access and devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets can be expensive. “Provide information on how to access the event for people with limited or no access to internet at home, and be willing to share information offline too,” says Lydia X. Z. Brown, a disabled advocate, attorney, and adjunct professor. If you’re hosting an event over video conferencing software like Zoom, Google Hangouts, or GoToMeeting, offer the option for attendees to dial-in by phone and participate without a computer or internet.\n\nIf everyone will have internet access, what other technology might attendees need to fully participate? If the event is being held on social media (i.e., Facebook Live, Instagram Live/Stories, YouTube), do attendees need to have an account on that platform to take part? Have you looked into any accessibility issues inherent to the platform you are using?\n\nCheck out this guide: Best video conferencing apps and software for accessibility.\n\n“I think that organizers should always be aware of the accessibility of the platform they intend to use,” says Keenan Provencher, a recent college graduate who is visually impaired and uses VoiceOver technology. Explore the accessibility features that are built-in to the platforms you’re considering for the event and determine what you might need to provide, such as captioning. Compare the different options available for hosting your event to see which is the best fit.\n\nInclude disabled people in your events\n\nAs you’re planning and creating events, make sure to reach out to disabled speakers, performers, and other talent who may be interested and available for your events. If you’re putting together a series of authors to read their work, include disabled authors. If you are organizing a comedy show, hire disabled comedians to be part of it. If you’re hosting a webinar series on money management, have disabled financial experts among your speakers. Disabled people should be present at every stage of your planning process: Invite and include them as speakers and assume that they will also be attending your virtual events.\n\nEnsure access for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities\n\nYour virtual events need to be accessible to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Access needs aren’t universal, so be open to exploring different tools and technology to make sure that your attendees have no problem attending the event.\n\n“Organizers need to be patient with people with ID when explaining online platforms,” explains Liz Weintraub, the senior advocacy specialist at the Association of University Centers on Disability. “At first, I got really nervous about using Zoom and Adobe Connect because I wasn’t sure I could use them. But my colleagues were patient was me and if one way doesn’t work, then try something else.” Weintraub points out that not all online platforms are equally accessible so a willingness to experiment and try something else is important.\n\nNoor Pervez, the community engagement coordinator at Autistic Self Advocacy Network, says that access needs around sensory issues, such as extremely loud videos, need to be considered for virtual events just as they would for in-person events. He also recommends “leaving in time to process information, such as a 10-minute break every hour or so.”\n\nWeintraub suggests that event organizers “create a tip sheet for online platforms with directions so people will feel comfortable with online platforms.” The tip sheet can include step-by-step information about how to use the platform(s) and the option to attend training sessions about the platform(s) before the event. The most important thing for access, she says, is to be patient and not rush attendees.\n\nWhat to do in advance\n\n“Event organizers should always share what they are already planning to do to increase access for their events,” says Brown, “and how people who may have other access needs can request that those needs be met.” Make it possible for your attendees to (anonymously or with their name and RSVP attached) request that specific access needs be met. This is particularly helpful if someone has very individualized access needs outside of the ones you and other organizers have prepared for.\n\nFactor the costs of captioning, sign language interpretation, and other potential accommodations into your budget.\n\nMake sure the service you’re using to host the virtual event is compatible with assistive technology like screen readers.\n\nEnsure the platform you’re using allows for computer-based audio listening/speaking and phone-based audio listening/speaking.\n\nMake sure your events are accessible to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) users by offering multiple ways for attendees to participate, answer questions, submit questions, and interact.\n\nOffer training sessions with event organizers/volunteers prior to the event on how to use the platform(s) the event will be hosted on.\n\nOffer all accessibility information upfront and publicly to interested attendees.\n\nHave an accessibility point person who can assist with troubleshooting or access issues and provide contact information for them.\n\nGive attendees the opportunity to (anonymously, if desired) share any additional accessibility requests that were not covered in the event’s access information.\n\nShare the format of the event (e.g. discussion vs. listening to a presentation, or something else) and how long it plans to run for so attendees can plan around their need to take breaks, arrive late, leave early, etc.\n\nProvide any written or visual materials ahead of time to give people an idea of what to expect and the ability to plan in advance. Be sure to use an accessible file format.\n\nAllow attendees to send questions and comments in advance.\n\nGive notice about questions that participants might be asked to respond to, even icebreakers (for example, “Everyone introduce yourself and say where you’re from”).\n\nMake it clear to attendees that they will have an opportunity to ask questions so they can prepare.\n\nProvide a glossary of terms that will be used during the event and define them.\n\nIf you have chosen to use Zoom, take precautions to avoid “Zoombombing” and other security issues.\n\nMake sure everyone has access to any links or login codes they need to join a live video call ahead of time.\n\nTake a look at the Inclusive Design Principles and see how your event planning holds up to them. How can you be as inclusive as possible?\n\nFor more, check out these Accessibility Tips for a Better Zoom/Virtual Meeting Experience.\n\nPreparing Virtual Invitations and Presentations\n\nInclude detailed, step-by-step directions of how to get on the event and how to use the platform.\n\nEnsure that fonts are easy to read and text is large and has good color contrast.\n\nBe mindful of jargon, slang, and assumed knowledge to be inclusive of all attendees.\n\nUse plain language.\n\nAvoid ableist and other negative language.\n\nEnsure your slides are uncluttered and consider using images to help explain concepts.\n\nIf you use images, include alternative text and image descriptions.\n\nDo not use flashing or strobing animations in a presentation or other materials you and other event organizers are creating. If you are including material that already has strobing or flashing, such as a showing of a film or television show, remove the strobing from the original material or skip that portion of the material. If you absolutely must include something that has flashing or strobing (which, again, should really be avoided at all costs), then you must ensure you put a very clear warning in place before showing the material.\n\nIf you’re sharing pre-recorded video, be sure to describe what’s happening in the video and add captions using programs like Final Cut or Adobe Premiere, or apps like Clipomatic, Clips, Caption This, and AutCap.\n\nIf you’re uploading the video to YouTube, you have the option to use automated captions and then edit those captions to fix any errors before publishing.\n\nHire a professional to write captions for your videos, using websites like Rev, Alternative Communications Services, and ASLCaptions.\n\nHire a professional to provide sign language interpretation; you can find ASL interpreters using resources like the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf.\n\nHire a professional provide real-time captioning through vendors such as National Captioning Institute, CaptionAccess, and Streamtext, especially for webinars and other events where speakers will be interacting with attendees and answering questions in real time.\n\nCheck out this video on 3 Ways To Make Your Content More Accessible For Disabled People.\n\nLooking for an all-in-one guide on digital accessibility? Check out Rooted in Rights’ #AccessThat resources on transcripts, audio description, captions, and alt-text.\n\nDuring Your Virtual Event\n\nAccording to 3-Play Media, “To ensure your live-stream content is accessible, you’ll need three things: live captions, live descriptions, and a good audio environment.” Also, be sure to have a staff member or volunteer responsible for ensuring accessibility needs are met during the event.\n\nAccess for People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing or Have Sensory Disabilities\n\nMake sure your audio is clear; poor audio quality can make it hard for people to access the event and/or use apps that can help reduce background noise on calls, such as Krisp.\n\nHave your speakers use a headset whenever possible if this is accessible to them to improve audio.\n\nHosts and presenters should use a quiet room where they won’t be disturbed whenever possible.\n\nMute all attendees but those speaking to keep background noise to a minimum so that attendees can easily hear.\n\nAsk people speaking to say their name every time they speak, so captioners and attendees alike all know who is talking.\n\nFor more tips, check out this article: How to help students with a hearing impairment as courses move online.\n\nAccess for People Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired or Have Sensory Disabilities\n\nMake sure the speaker’s face is well-lit and can be clearly seen.\n\nIf there is a method that will be used to vote or flag who can speak next, make sure all participants can access the process.\n\nDescribe live scenarios. For example, if you are presenting a live video tutorial of applying makeup, you could describe the process: “I am now applying a dark purple lipstick to my upper lip.”\n\nDescribe any images, read any text that appears on screen, and describe anything that you gesture at as if you were explaining it to someone who isn’t in the same room as you.\n\nFor more tips, check out this article: 5 Accessibility Actions You Can Take When You’re Moving Your Conference or Classes Online.\n\nAccess for People Who Are Intellectually or Developmentally Disabled\n\nBe patient with your attendees when you’re explaining how to use online platforms, especially if they are new to the platform and haven’t used it before. Repeat information if necessary.\n\nUse accessible, plain language during the event and avoid using jargon.\n\nBuild processing time/breaks into your event.\n\nLeave ample time for questions.\n\nOffer the option for anyone using chat boxes to have their messages read aloud to everyone during the event (either by using a revoicer or having an event organizer read them.\n\nFor more information on inclusive meetings, check out this Inclusive Meetings guide from the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.\n\nAfter your virtual event\n\nShare materials in an accessible format.\n\nIf your team live-tweeted the event or if a Twitter chat was part of the event, create a blog post or other easy-to-read collection of those tweets for anyone who was unable to participate live.\n\nOffer your attendees the opportunity to provide feedback about the event, including accessibility, to help you prepare to plan the next one.\n\nMake accessibility an ongoing, inclusive conversation in your community for all types of events.\n\nRemember: Accessibility is a learning process\n\nEven for disabled people, accessibility—and doing the work to make sure your own events are accessible—is a learning process. It’s important for all of us to acknowledge that others may have access needs that differ from our own. Instead of making assumptions, offer your attendees easy and clear ways to request their specific access needs be met and to provide feedback after your event, which you can use as a learning experience for the next one.\n\nIf you’re hosting smaller events tailored to a specific group of attendees, such as virtual webinars for your employees or sober community and recovery meetings to replace in-person ones, check in with that community. Make it an inclusive, ongoing conversation around access needs in everything you’re doing virtually so that everyone, including disabled people, has a voice in what platforms are being used and how.\n\nWe can all make accessibility a priority and remain open-minded to changing our processes, learning more, and creating events that are inclusive and welcoming to all.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

This might be the first time nondisabled readers have come across that sentiment, as Heumann points out in Chapter 12, aptly titled “Our Story.” Heumann connects popular contemporary media portrayals of disability, such as Me Before You and Million Dollar Baby, to her own story. “What if someone’s story began with the words: ‘I never wished I didn’t have a disability,’” she writes, bringing the book full circle back to its opening line.\n\nHeumann’s memoir, which is in equal parts a history lesson on disability rights activism in the United States and an intimate look at her life from childhood to present, centers on ideas of disability rights, community, access and equity, independence, autonomy, and disability pride.\n\nFrom the very beginning chapters, I was hooked. Unlike Heumann, I was born with my disabilities (primarily autism and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and I am not a wheelchair user, but many of her childhood experiences mirrored mine. “The first time I’d ever met another disabled kid was when I went for the evaluation,” she writes in an early chapter about the access barriers she faced while trying to get a primary school education. The writing is concise and evocative and she draws the reader into every scene. I felt like I was right there with young Judy, rolling to her friend Arlene’s home, yelling for her to come out and play because there was no accessible entrance.\n\nIt’s a challenge to write a book that centers so strongly on disability rights without pandering to a nondisabled audience, but Heumann clearly trusts that all her readers will get it. Heumann has faced many people throughout the years who don’t know they’re being ableist—telling her that she can’t attend public school because her wheelchair is a fire hazard or not granting her a teaching license because her wheelchair is unsafe for young kids. But she knows that the best way to win people over, including her readers, is to be honest with them and give them the opportunity to empathize with her instead of distancing themselves from the disabled experience.\n\nHeumann’s writing does not hold back. She is unafraid to share the most difficult moments with us, such as when other children insisted that she must be sick because she used a wheelchair or when she felt like a burden simply for asking for equal access. “I recognize now that exclusion, especially at the level and frequency at which I experienced it, is traumatic,” she writes, and she continues to show us what this looks and feels like throughout the memoir. It’s traumatic to be asked to leave an airplane because you have a disability, or to be unable to attend the same social activities as your fellow college students.\n\nHeumann contrasts this with the pure joy and collective access of being part of the disability community. She experienced this at a camp for kids with disabilities and in her special education classroom, and she experienced it as an adult disability activist in her work with organizations like Disabled In Action, the Center for Independent Living, and World Institute on Disability. “We treasured the ability to create our own space, where our communication needs, and their slower pacing, were respected,” she writes about the long meetings she and other protestors had while they were fighting for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. Those meetings, and their work, were designed around collective access: waiting patiently for everyone to speak, making sure people had access to their medications, using American Sign Language and translators.\n\nCollective access is a major theme in Heumann’s memoir, both in her personal life and in her activism. “Institutions don’t like change because change takes time and can entail costs,” she writes, and she also argues that people need to assume it’s possible to figure out accessibility and problem-solve and take action. Heumann comes across many excuses in her activist work for why existing institutions—such as schools, public transportation, and the government—can’t or won’t change. She and her fellow activists don’t take no for an answer. Throughout the book, Heumann takes matters into her own hands; she personally calls event organizers to challenge them when they question why a young disabled person should be invited to attend.\n\nHeumann is truthful about her place in the world as a Jewish disabled woman, and she recounts the erasure she experienced within the larger women’s rights movement, which ignored disability at the time. “What a pervasive influence silence and avoidance have had on my life,” she writes, in a scene where she is connecting her Jewish identity and the silence surrounding the Holocaust to the silence she encounters as a disabled woman.\n\nShe’s also thoughtful and honest about both her position of privilege as a white person with access to education and healthcare and the sexism she encounters as a disabled person. She credits other marginalized groups, particularly Black people and the LGBTQ+ community, for showing up for disabled activists when no one else would. But there were several times in Being Heumann that she used the civil rights movement and the Black experience in America with the disabled experience, which I felt almost conflated the two and ignored the existence of disabled people of color. These connections are meant to show readers how ignored disability rights were at the time when Heumann and her fellow activists were fighting for Section 504 and the ADA, but they sometimes miss the mark. Many white disabled people are quick to suggest that they understand what it’s like to experience racism because we experience ableism, but the two experiences are not the same, and our whiteness will always offer us a level of privilege and visibility that disabled people of color are not afforded in this country.\n\nOn the whole, many of the disability rights issues raised in Being Heumann are improving. Heumann recounts how a curb was like the “Great Wall of China” when she was a kid; if her friend lived on the other side of the street, it would have been literally impossible for her to get off the curb without curb cuts. Her memoir details some of the ways that disability rights have been won, and the steps backward we’ve taken as well—the passing of the Affordable Care Act, and legislation created to weaken it. I was surprised by just how much of her memoir, and the access barriers she’s faced, feel universal and timeless. “I did sometimes feel a little awkward about getting schlepped up the stairs backwards to Brownies, or getting carried down the back steps and through the garbage behind the synagogue to get to the elevator for Hebrew class,” she writes in an early chapter about her childhood. In 2020, nearly 30 years after the Americans With Disabilities Act passed, I still encounter public spaces where my friends and I have to carry a friend who uses a wheelchair inside up a set of stairs, and even accessible buildings are known for having their wheelchair-accessible entrance in the back by the dumpster.\n\nAt 211 pages, this memoir was concise and action-packed. Every chapter focuses on Heumann’s life, but she’s not a passive participant; she’s quite the opposite.\n\nBeing Heumann tells the story of Judith Heumann, but Heumann herself writes throughout the book that the work is not hers alone. She credits her family, in particular her mother, for instilling in her the idea that she could fight for her rights. Her memoir offers a lens to the larger disability rights movement, both in the States and globally, and she writes about the many other activists and friends she’s collaborated with over the years.\n\nHeumann’s memoir is ultimately a story of community, of disabled and nondisabled people coming together for collective access. “This is my story, yes, but I was one in a multitude,” Heumann writes. This is her story and it starts with the fact that she never wished she didn’t have a disability. It’s also all of our story; it’s our history, our movement, and our building block for the future. Heumann leaves the reader in the final chapter with actions we can all take to build a more inclusive world and become involved in modern day activism, and the sentiment that “we have the power. We are changing things.”\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

We drank cheap wine and ate home-cooked turkey and mashed potatoes on the couch. It wasn’t held in the ADA-compliant apartment that we lived in, with multiple elevators and grab bars in the bathrooms, because ours lacked a proper kitchen. The wine was served in plastic cups and one of our friends locked himself out of his dorm after the celebrations ended. But it was ours and it started a tradition that has become one of my favorite holiday staples.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, Friendsgiving refers to a large meal eaten with friends on or around Thanksgiving. The term didn’t become popular until the 2010s and there is no definite research that explains exactly why it did. Seven in 10 Americans between the ages of 18 and 38 prefer Friendsgiving to a traditional Thanksgiving, according to new research conducted by OnePoll in conjunction with Sabra. For my friends and I, Friendsgiving is essentially an annual chosen-family thankfulness celebration, as I called it last year. It started on our college campus, but we’ve carried on the tradition post-grad in our various apartments and houses. And we aren’t the only generation who loves it; my Gen X mother-in-law attends a Friendsgiving with her friends every November. Unlike Christmas (and Secret Santa parties that many friend groups host), Friendsgiving isn’t about spending money or partaking in traditions that you hate.\n\nIn my group of friends, a majority of us are LGBTQ+ and/or disabled. Our subsequent Friendsgivings have all been significantly more accessible than the first and are designed around including everyone: We serve vegetarian dishes for friends who don’t eat meat and include non-alcoholic beverages among the offerings. The events are potluck style at one person’s home, usually with the offer to stay over so that no one has to drive home tired or under the influence. When I’ve had trouble driving long distances due to my disability, my friends have offered to carpool instead. We talk about accessibility early on, ensuring everyone has the information they need about transportation to Friendsgiving, how to get inside and navigate the home, what food will be served, where they can sleep, and anything else they might be concerned about.\n\nThe reason I love Friendsgiving so much is because it’s all about choice. It doesn’t come with pressure or expectations; if someone can’t make it one year because they’re traveling or sick or just lost a loved one, the rest of us understand. Families of origin often make their loved ones feel guilty for not coming to the holidays, but our chosen family keeps the invitation open without the added guilt. We all have different abilities and needs, and no one is judged based on what they can cook or their transportation to the event or the mobility aids they might bring with them. When I started using a cane and switched from sleeping on air mattresses to real mattresses for my Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, my friends were accommodating and never made me feel uncomfortable.This year, I decorated my cane with rainbow holiday lights and danced around with it in the living room of my friends’ new home.\n\nThere are no awkward questions about what we’re doing with our lives and if we are accomplishing traditional goals, like we might hear at Thanksgiving: Are we in serious relationships? Have we finished school? Will we ever find a better job that’s actually in our field? Are we going to live with our parents forever? Fifty-eight percent of people from Sabra’s research say they prefer Friendsgiving to a traditional Thanksgiving because they get to avoid personal questions from their families of origin, and over half also feel less pressure to impress their guests at Friendsgiving.\n\nAmong my chosen family, there is an implicit understanding and compassion for one another; we’re all at different places in our lives. In a group that’s majority queer and disabled, we don’t place as much value on heteronormative, abled measures of success like home ownership, car ownership (or the ability to drive), marriage, or children. It’s completely normal to have someone leave the dinner table to take their medication, call their therapist’s office, or put on noise-canceling headphones for sensory reprieve.\n\nI’m fortunate that my family of origin is accepting and nontraditional as well, but not everyone is that lucky—and Friendsgiving is a place where we don’t need to hide our feelings about the world. This holiday is about making up our own traditions, and ours are about unconditional love, access, and intentional community.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

It’s comfortable, familiar. It doesn’t feel small or limited,” she writes, and the memoir illustrates that. Girma’s memoir is written in present tense, so readers feel as though we’re experiencing events exactly as she did in the moment, whether it was her volunteer work in Mali or her trip to Alaska or her days at Harvard Law School.\n\nAt the heart of Girma’s memoir—which dives into her fear of cooking, her interest in travel and salsa dancing, and her passion for law and public speaking—is the message that the world needs to be more accessible to disabled people.\n\n“Society designed this environment for people who can see and hear. In this environment, I’m disabled. They put the burden on me to step out of my world and reach into theirs,” she writes in an early chapter, and the concept continues throughout the book. Girma faces barriers in college when she pushes for accessible menus at the cafeteria just as she faced them playing games with her friends as a kid.\n\nGirma’s personal stories don’t just encourage access. They go deeper than that; she wants nondisabled people to take responsibility and create collective access together. In an early scene, Girma recounts what it was like as a kid being told that she needed to ask about the homework; “I just feel tolerated,” she writes. She demonstrates collective access through scenes with her friends, Gordon and Liqin, and with classmates and mentors during her Harvard Law School years.\n\nIn these moments, Girma and her community design what access looks like and build it together—typing into a braille computer to communicate at a noisy bar, and advocating for truly accessible menu solutions together. I felt the joy and love in access in these scenes: It’s the same way I have felt when my friends text me in a noisy bar because I can’t hear their voices or when someone sits down with me in solidarity because I’m the only one who needs to rest at a networking event. As she and her friends create collective access and advocate for systemic changes in their communities, Girma also discovers her passion for law and disability advocacy.\n\nAnother thread running through Girma’s memoir is the importance of independence and misconceptions about what disabled people can do. Like many, Girma has to challenge her parents to allow her to do things like travel (or even take the bus) and faces classmates, colleagues, and mentors underestimating and looking down on her. Throughout her journey, she’s determined to break down those myths, while never falling into the trope of ‘overcoming’ disability, either.\n\nShe’s honest about how being deafblind impacts her life—writing about exactly how difficult it is to join a conversation when all she can hear are vague mumbles—and also wants society to see her for who she is rather than seeing a collection of ideas about disabled or deafblind people. She also touches on inspiration porn and writes in a chapter about a law networking event, “People with disabilities get called inspiring so often, usually for the most insignificant things, that the word now feels like a euphemism for pity.” Girma is well-acquainted with inspiration porn as someone who made headlines for her graduation from Harvard Law, and she’s not afraid to dispel the idea that she’s inspiring simply for going to law school.\n\nThere are a few scenes during the book in which Girma faults herself for the ableism she experiences. “By framing the situation as me-against-them, I perpetuated and guaranteed my own exclusion,” she writes in one scene about communicating with sighted and hearing people as a deafblind person. These moments felt authentic to me as a disabled reader; I too have blamed myself for ableism over the years. Girma wants to be fair and take responsibility for her own decisions, which I respect, but there are a few instances where I thought she was too hard on herself and didn’t recognize that ableism and access barriers aren’t her fault.\n\nAt 266 pages, the memoir felt a little short and focused more on Girma’s childhood and teen years than on her experiences at Harvard and beyond. As a reader, there are moments and chapters that I wish were explored in more depth. Girma spends a lot of time on her Eritrean heritage and makes a few references to being black, but I would have loved to learn more about how her race and culture inform who she is and how she connects to the world. I also would have liked to go deeper into her relationships, especially with her parents, to understand their connection outside of their worries about her disability affecting her safety. Most chapters also felt like there was a lesson embedded in the story, excepting the chapter that focused on her family’s heritage, and I would have liked more moments that told the reader about who Girma is without trying to teach us something important about disability or access.\n\nAlthough Girma doesn’t use the term disabled to refer to herself very often throughout the book, except to say she’s disabled by her circumstances, she does include an appendix at the end of the book titled, “A Brief Guide to Increasing Access for People with Disabilities,” that covers best practices for talking about disability and discourages terms such as special needs and differently abled. There is no explicit discussion about the phrase disabled person versus person with a disability, but Girma typically defaults to the latter.\n\nOn the whole, Girma’s memoir is a love letter to the disability community, especially to deafblind people, and it celebrates collective access, disability justice, and education, both formal and informal. “I’m going to create a community of people who believe that disability itself is not a barrier; the biggest barriers are social, physical, and digital,” Girma writes—and that’s exactly what she does, not only in her own community but through her advocacy around the world.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

When she saw me at a family function, my grandmother asked, “What’s that about?” We didn’t have a great relationship and I wasn’t aware of her opinions on queer people so I shrugged and said, “My friend gave it to me.”\n\nI developed a strong identity of LGBTQ+ pride over the next few years, as I came out as queer to most of my friends and family. I wore many queer pins, donned rainbow socks, and participated in the Day of Silence at school. I posted photos with my girlfriends on MySpace and Facebook, and wrote blog posts about why I was proud to be queer. I was so active in an online LGBTQ+ youth forum that I became a moderator for the space.\n\nFor me, queer pride was about showing up in the fullest expression of myself in every interaction. But sometimes it felt safer to hide who I was, like when bullies started following me home from school and threatening to beat me up or tell my dad that I was gay before I’d had a chance to come out to him.\n\nYet even through these acts of violence and the smaller moments of queer antagonism (like my grandmother referring to my girlfriend as my ‘friend’ after I came out, or my friend saying she thought intimacy between two women wasn’t ‘the same’), I wanted to be honest about who I was. I felt more authentic when I was open about being queer, knowing that it could cost me relationships and other opportunities and opened me up to harassment. My queer pride was just as much a celebration of how far the LGBTQ+ community has come in terms of equality and acceptance as it was a declaration that I wasn’t interested in being a false version of myself.\n\nIt took me a lot longer to embrace my disability pride. By the time I was in college, everyone knew that I was queer, although coming out to new friends on campus was still awkward. I joined my college’s Queer Straight Alliance and went to my first Pride parade. But although I’d been disabled my entire life—I was diagnosed with autism as a child and had a variety of other symptoms that were later recognized as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome—I had no idea where to start with disability pride.\n\nI’m not alone in feeling this way. “I wouldn’t have disability pride without embracing my queer identities,” says Dom Chatterjee, the editor-in-chief of Rest for Resistance. “Even though I have multiple chronic health issues, I didn’t begin to identify as ‘disabled’ until I built community with other disabled trans people of color who taught me how the word can be empowering. These friends reflect my humanity back to me and validate that my whole self is valuable.”\n\nI knew a handful of other disabled people as a kid, but we didn’t stay friends outside of our interaction in special education classrooms or occupational therapy waiting rooms. I didn’t make any close disabled friends until college, when my group of friends just happened to be majority disabled. We didn’t all share the same diagnosis but we co-created accessibility in our friendship spaces together, whether that meant supporting a friend who had a panic attack or calling campus security to get a path made in the snow for wheelchair users.\n\nOther LGBTQ+ disabled people find they have the opposite experience: They develop a sense of disability pride early on that makes them more comfortable exploring their gender or sexuality later.\n\n“Being immersed in these communities provides me with the comfort to be myself and find others who are fully their selves,” says Marlena Chertock, a digital storyteller, journalist, writer, and editor “Gaining disability pride helped me express my bisexual pride. I’m grateful to the amazing disabled and queer writers and people who came before me, who enable me to live my truest self.”\n\nQueer pride probably came easier to me because I had LGBTQ+ role models, but very few disabled role models. My first disabled role model was my mom, who passed away when I was 11. I didn’t know many LGBTQ+ people when I was young, and many of them I only knew from online, but I at least had a roadmap of what my future might look like—I had Ellen Degeneres, the cast of The L Word, my older bi friend Casey from MySpace.\n\nWhether it was intentional or not, I’d been taught from a very young age that my disabilities made me a burden, and they were something to fix, hide, or make easier on others. I’m privileged that my close family didn’t treat me this way, and my parents advocated against therapies like applied behavioral analysis (ABA). But teachers still forced me to sit on my hands instead of flapping them excitedly while I answered questions about my favorite subjects in school, and discouraged me from telling fiction stories out loud to my classmates. Educators and counselors in and outside of the classroom. They taught me that asking too many questions is ‘annoying,’ and that access isn’t a right and I should change my body and mind instead of asking for adaptations that made my life easier.\n\nFinding disability community on and offline radically shifted my worldview. Planning accessible events with my college friends and talking to them about the accommodations we had to request in class (moving classrooms to an accessible building, longer time on tests, extensions on papers) showed me that it isn’t shameful to be disabled and that there’s nothing wrong with asking my professors to take my tests in a different room.\n\nI found online activists like Lydia X. Z. Brown and Neurowonderful that shaped my understanding of what it means to be autistic—and the reality that I could have autistic pride, that I didn’t have to constantly change who I was for the benefit of non-autistic people. Advocates like Annie Segarra and Denarii Grace taught me that I didn’t have to be ashamed when I started using a cane, and that a mobility aid can be a symbol of disability pride and visibility.\n\n“A factor in understanding myself and feeling empowered to be visible has been finding support through LGBTQ+ communities, both physical and digital,” agrees Eli, a nonbinary and bi educator with a connective tissue disorder. “These communities have been very intersectionality-minded, with special attention to the struggles of QTPOC and disabled folks. These communal values and experience opened spaces for me to talk to and hear from other folks with similar experiences of queerness and disability. in turn exposing me to more current, radical ideas and activists than I’d been aware of before.”\n\nBeing part of radical, inclusive spaces was also powerful for me. My disability community was made up of people with multiply marginalized identities from the start. Over the years, more of my disabled friends have come out as LGBTQ+ and more of my LGBTQ+ friends have explored their relationship to disability. Through this radically inclusive disability community and pride, I’ve embraced who I am, my full self: Someone who is flapping their hands as they march in an all-rainbow outfit for Pride.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

It was the first time she’d ever been in a space designed for autistic people.\n\n“At such a young age, it was incredibly powerful to meet other autistic people, especially college students and adults,” Haley says. She believes autistic spaces are wonderful opportunities for autistic people to learn more about themselves and discover the diversity of autistic people. “For many autistic people—especially younger autistic folks—it is the first point of contact we have with others like us,” she explains.\n\nIn a world that is overwhelmingly not designed for autistic and disabled people, there is power in spaces and communities created specifically for us. The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) is a nonprofit run by and for autistic people. ASAN develops autistic cultural activities.\n\nNoor Pervez, the community engagement coordinator for ASAN, feels fortunate to work in an entirely autistic office. His favorite part is that he doesn’t need to hide or change the way his mind and body naturally work. “If I need to work from under my desk to cut down on stimuli for a bit, that’s completely fine,” he says. “I’m also able to use AAC with nobody so much as batting an eye, which is wonderful.”\n\nAutistic spaces and communities give autistic people settings where we can be completely ourselves, according to Noor, and that offers an unparalleled freedom. Many autistic people feel the need to mask or appear as non-autistic as possible when we’re among non-autistic people—and that can be exhausting. When I’ve spent a couple of hours dedicating most of my energy to hiding my autistic traits, it usually leads to equal or greater time spent burn out. So if I have to mask for eight hours, for example, I’m frazzled and unable to properly function for another eight to 16 hours.\n\nLaura K. Anderson, a doctorate student at the University of Northern Colorado studying special education, agrees that masking takes a huge energy toll on them. That’s one reason they started a private Facebook group for autistic women and nonbinary people. They’ve also found that being part of autistic communities on- and offline is a great tool for self-knowledge. In a space where everyone is autistic, you can get feedback on aspects of your life (“Does anyone else experience this?” or “How would you handle this situation?”) and receive tips from other people who understand your experience.\n\n“I can learn about myself, both by asking questions about my experiences and by reading their questions and thinking about my own life,” says Laura. “My depth of knowledge about myself has increased significantly, and I’ve learned that I’m not alone.” I’m also a part of a private group for autistic people online and I’ve used it to ask if anyone else experiences the world in the same way—do other people feel similarly overwhelmed by dropping someone off at the airport or do they get up in the middle of a workday to dance for five minutes?\n\nThere’s a deep sense of joy in being part of a community that understands and respects you exactly the way you are. Laura loves the beauty of being in a room full of people who are stimming, or performing repetitive motions for sensory reasons. “It is a beautiful feeling, to see everyone else moving their bodies in natural ways and then letting your own body move the way it wants to,” the say.\n\nSarah Pripas-Kapit, a writer and chairperson of the Association for Autistic Community, experiences this joy through the unique traditions that are created when autistic people come together. The Association for Autistic Community runs Autspace, a retreat that is organized by and for autistic people. One of these developing traditions is a glow party, where people at the retreat go into a dark room and play with glow toys for a few hours. “It’s a ton of fun and is a real celebration of autistic differences,” says Sarah.\n\nAt Autspace 2018, they also had pattern blocks that were out in the main area for people to play with whenever they wanted to. Designing accessible retreats is important to Sarah and the Association for Autistic Community, but that isn’t without challenges. Autistic people have a variety of access needs and accommodating those needs at the same time can be difficult.\n\nAt their conferences, it’s totally okay to walk out in the middle of a presentation, sit on the floor, play with pattern blocks, or flap your hands. They also make it a priority to host the retreat in a space that does not have fluorescent lights in the main areas, and they have a quiet space available for those who need it.\n\n“Accessibility is always a work in progress, in my opinion,” Sarah says. “I want to do my best to make everyone feel as though their needs are being met as much as possible.”\n\nIt’s also important to have autistic spaces and communities that are dedicated to people who have intersecting identities, like the Black Disability Collective, a movement and closed Facebook group for black disabled people founded by Teighlor McGee, a black autistic poet and advocate. Autistic people of color need their own spaces free from white supremacy and racism, and white autistic people need to prioritize access for autistic people of color.\n\nIt can be powerful to be part of a community space that’s designed at the intersection of your identities, like a group specifically for autistic Jewish people or for autistic LGBTQ+ people. While I’m not a part of any formal LGBTQ+ autistic groups, I love spending time with my friends who are part of both communities because there’s a deep sense of mutual understanding.\n\nAutistic queer spaces are important to Eryn Star, an autistic queer student at Albion College and an ASAN Autistic Campus Inclusion alumni. “I see autistic spaces creating sensory accessibility in ways that queer spaces often don’t because queer spaces run by non-autistic people often emphasize loud festivities as a core part of pride celebrations,” they say. “I joke that sensory overload is queer culture.”\n\nAutistic communities like the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, social media groups, and Autspace also encourage something that’s sorely missing from mainstream spaces—autistic pride. In 2011, autistic people reclaimed April as Autism Acceptance Month (some are also now referring to it as Autistic Pride Month), and it has become one of ASAN’s major projects.\n\n“Many of us never experienced autistic pride until we came to an autistic space for the first time,” Eryn explains. “It is in autistic spaces where we fully realize that being autistic is an identity, culture, and community.”\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

I started using a cane in August or September 2016 to help with balance, stability, stamina, and chronic pain. I don’t use my cane all the time, only when I feel I need it, and I generally take it with me for longer trips or outings where I know I’ll be away from home for many hours at a time.\n\nHere’s what I wish people knew about what it’s like to be a young cane user:\n\nI do actually need my cane.\n\nIt’s not for fashion and it isn’t a part of a costume.\n\nMany people who use canes (or wheelchairs or other mobility aids) don’t need them full-time. If you see me with my cane one day and without it the next, it doesn’t mean that I’m “cured” or “better.” I’ll have this disability for the rest of my life.\n\nThere are different reasons I may be using my cane, and those reasons are different from other cane users. One day I may be using it because I’m exhausted and in pain, and another day it might be for balance.\n\nIf I take my cane out or put it away, it doesn’t mean I’m “faking it,” either. I don’t use my cane all the time and often carry a small backpack to keep it in when I’m not using it. It’s also more difficult to use a cane in some situations—when there’s ice on the ground, on cobblestones, or when I need both my hands to carry something.\n\nIf you want to ask questions, please be respectful.\n\nIf I don’t know you, I may not be comfortable explaining to you why I use a cane or the details of my disability. It depends how polite you are and how I’m feeling that day. You can ask (nicely), but don’t expect the answers you’re looking for.\n\nPeople do sometimes stare at me and ask me questions (like “Why do you use a cane?” or “Did you break your foot?”). If you’re out with me and I have my cane, you may notice it. It’s partly because we don’t have enough awareness or representation of younger cane users as a society. Do your part to make sure you’re part of the solution—advocate for inclusive media representation.\n\nI don’t have a cane with a sword in it, or any other kind of weapon, but I have seen them at Renaissance faires and I think they’re cool. Mine needs to be lightweight and foldable for my needs, so I probably won’t buy one anytime soon. Same goes for heavy, serious canes with lions or skulls on top.\n\nMy needs vary from day-to-day.\n\nI may not always need a seat (on public transportation, at an event, at a park, and so on) but it’s appreciated when people offer or just simply don’t take the seats if they don’t need them so I can make that choice.\n\nPlease do give me some space if you see me coming, especially if we’re in a crowded area. It’s easy for me to accidentally trip people with my cane if they don’t see me coming and I can’t get out of their way in time.\n\nIf I’m coming up or down the stairs or an escalator, likewise, don’t stay in my lane and try and make me let go of the handrail and go around you. This can be really dangerous and even impossible for me to do.\n\nI might walk slower than the pace you’re used to, whether I have my cane with me or not. If I’m walking slowly in an area with heavy foot traffic, I try and stay out of other people’s way. All I ask is that you do the same, and have some patience with people who are walking slowly in public. Instead of getting angry with us, just go around us and move on with your day.\n\nMy disability will always be a part of my life.\n\nI’m proud of my cane. I don’t necessarily want it cropped out of photos or hidden from view. I’m also proud of my disability and both are part of who I am.\n\nI appreciate it when people make an effort to learn about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (and I think most cane users can say the same of their disabilities) and do their own research. It’s okay to ask me about how it impacts my life, because it’s different for everyone, but knowing that someone put in the effort to learn more means a lot.\n\nI’m a cane user, and while it doesn’t define my life, it is a big part of who I am and how I experience the world. I love it most when people take me as I am and love me for it, and show up with empathy and compassion for both the experiences we don’t share and the ones we do.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

If applicants use the SSA for their documentation, they’re required to show proof that they are eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or SSI, including a copy of their SSA notice of award or Benefits Planning Query showing that their next scheduled disability review will be five to seven years or more from the date of their last SSA disability determination.\n\n“I went into the process understanding that if I got a job within a certain amount of time, the loans would be reinstated,” says Cara. For three years after a disability discharge, applicants are monitored, and they must meet certain requirements: They can’t make more money from employment than their state’s poverty guidelines for a family of two, they can’t receive a new federal student loan or TEACH grant (for students who are planning to become teachers in a high-need field in a low-income area), and they can’t receive notice from SSA that they are no longer disabled. Cara wondered whether she should stop looking for full-time work but chose to keep applying. Maybe a month after her loans were forgiven by the federal government, she got a position as a development coordinator for the National Council on Independent Living (NCIL).\n\nCara’s loans were reinstated when she took the job at NCIL and she moved to a small studio apartment outside Washington, D.C. to start the job. She still wants to move into a one-bedroom apartment but can’t currently afford to. She also has to make monthly payments to the Social Security Administration because the SSA continued to pay her SSI for months after she received a full-time job, even though she reported her new employment and income to them immediately. She currently owes them around $6,000 from these overpayments. Most of Cara’s income goes toward her rent, the payments to SSA, food, commuting costs, and other bills, and she says she’s very fortunate that her parents make her student loan payments. “I feel bad about that, especially because I know my family doesn’t have a ton of money, but I don’t have much of a choice,” she says. “Right now, I’m just trying to save a little money to have a cushion.”\n\nDisabled college graduates are often at a disadvantage when it comes to paying off student debt. They may not be eligible to have their loans discharged or may face significant barriers if they aren’t already receiving SSI or SSDI (and applying for either is a lengthy process in itself). To qualify with just documentation from a physician, applicants must have a doctor certify that they’re unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental disability that can be expected to result in death, has lasted for at least 60 months, or can be expected to last for at least 60 months. And substantial gainful activity is defined as paid work or “significant physical or mental activities” or a combination of both. The only positive is that many graduates who do have their loan discharged will not have that debt cancellation treated as income. Before the The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed the tax status of the cancellation of student loan debt when the borrower dies or becomes disabled, the cancellation of debt was treated as income to the borrower (or the borrower’s estate).\n\nMany graduates with disabilities who are unable to qualify for total discharge of their loans struggle to pay off their debt. Unless they are able to qualify for discharge, like Cara initially was, they might be on the hook for high monthly loan payments. It’s harder for disabled college graduates to find jobs and work—and subsequently, to pay any student loan bills they might have. A disproportionate number of people with disabilities are unemployed or underemployed. According to the United States Department of Labor, only 60.1% of men and 51.4% of women with disabilities are employed, and many disabled people are still paid subminimum wages for their employment. Job applications frequently include ableist language about physical requirements such as standing, walking, lifting up to a specific number of pounds, or the ability to see and hear, even though the workplaces are required by the ADA to make reasonable accommodations. Applications also sometimes include that candidates must have a valid driver’s license and their own private vehicle, even for positions where driving is not part of the job requirements like it would be for a delivery driver.\n\nPaying your loans is particularly challenging when you have a disability and don’t work a full-time job with benefits. According to a survey by Discover Student Loans, more than half of recent graduates said they are worried about needing to work extra jobs to afford their student loan payments. Although this survey included people ages 24-28, the same problem faces older college grads as well. Johnnie Mazzocco, a 60-year-old adjunct professor who is starting her own business, received her education later in life, starting college in 1990 and finishing in 2008 with an MA in English and Film Studies and an MFA in Digital Arts from the University of Oregon. All of her student loans are through the federal government (none are through private lenders) and her total debt is $200,000.\n\n“I always feel like I’m trying to dodge a bullet,” Johnnie says about her debt. “The idea of getting much older and not having money and not being able to take care of myself terrifies me.” Last year, she put her loans on hold under forbearance so she could try to get her business off the ground. The loans are about to go back into repayment. When Johnnie received a computer-generated letter saying she would have to make monthly payments of $700, she spoke with representatives over the phone. The representative couldn’t give her an exact amount that her new payments would be—only that they could be even higher, up to $2,000 per month.\n\nWhen she started college, Johnnie knew that she’d have to deal with her student loan debt eventually. But she was a single mother and felt she had no other option than to try to better her situation through higher education. She feels that the colleges she went to made her aware of every opportunity to receive scholarships and grants in place of loans, and she applied to everything that was available. Since graduating, Johnnie has made ends meet as an adjunct professor at several colleges and has also worked as a copywriter, housekeeper, and bartender to supplement her income. The reason she’s been trying so hard to start her own business is so she can finally have financial freedom and make her health her number one priority.\n\nIn 2005, Johnnie began having health issues that doctors believe are related to an autoimmune disorder. She’s received several diagnoses, including Mast Cell Activation Disorder, and her symptoms—including vision problems, migraines, severe body pain, inflammation, sore muscles and joints, and brain fog—make it extremely difficult for her to work. Right now, she works from home and needs the flexibility in order to survive, like she did this past October when she spent most of the month working from her bed. “Working at home is a saving grace to me,” she explains. Many disabled college grads don’t have access to that option: They can’t do their jobs from home and work in an inaccessible, inflexible, and unaccommodating workplace.\n\nThat’s the situation that Katie Tastrom, a writer, lawyer, and activist who lives in Syracuse, New York, is facing because she can’t find work that accommodates her disability. Katie was freelancing but recently had to quit almost all her work because of her health, although she does some public interest law work when she’s able to. “Ableism makes us less likely to be hired and some disabilities like mine make it impossible to work at all,” she says.\n\nWhile she was still in law school, Katie lost her scholarship because she had to drop to part-time student status to accommodate her health issues. This resulted in her having over $200,000 in student debt, which she says would be at least half that amount had she not lost her scholarship funding. She says that if the college had been able to pro-rate her scholarship to accommodate her part-time schedule, it would have been immensely helpful to allow her to graduate with less debt while still being able to succeed as a student.\n\nLike many disabled people, Katie wasn’t able to work while she was a student to make up for the loss of her scholarship and needed to take out additional student loans. Although working while you’re in school is often touted as advice for graduating with fewer student loans, many college students with disabilities are unable to juggle both schoolwork and work. Options for employment might also be inaccessible and unaccommodating—the office might be in a building without an elevator or the job might require physical and mental tasks that not everyone can do. Employers still discriminate against people with visible disabilities and many aren’t willing to provide reasonable accommodations even if a disabled person is the best fit for the job.\n\nThere also aren’t many options for disabled college grads who need help paying off their student debt but who don’t qualify for total discharge. Although she does public interest work, Katie doesn’t qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) like Candis Welch, a procurement analyst at the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority who received her Master of Public Administration degree. Candis and other graduates who use the PSLF program need to work full-time for a nonprofit organization or government agency and make 120 qualifying payments toward their debt before the rest of their debt will be forgiven (and not treated as taxable income). It’s a great option for both disabled and nondisabled college graduates, but you need to be working full-time at a qualifying organization, so it’s not an option for disabled people who are working part-time or freelance at nonprofits.\n\nCandis’s current loan debt sits at around $43,000, and she says right now, her payments are manageable—although they weren’t before her recent new employment and corresponding salary increase. Candis has high in-home care and medical costs due to her disability. She thinks it would be helpful if she had access to a program that offered some kind of subsidy to make paying for both more feasible. “It’s very difficult to pay thousands on nurses and rent, and tack on high interest education loans — it makes it almost impossible to achieve,” she says. “We want to encourage disabled persons to pursue higher education and become changemakers in society.”\n\nStudent loans are a critical disability rights issue for exactly that reason: They often impact disabled college graduates uniquely because of the ways that ableism and inaccessibility make it difficult to move through the world with a disability. It’s not easy to make ends meet for many people with disabilities and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a quarter of working-age adults with a disability lived in poverty in 2017. Many disabled people rely on meager earnings from SSI or SSDI. Disabled grads also may not be able to work full-time but aren’t eligible for SSI or SSDI, or don’t want to apply because they’re still working part-time or trying to find work. It can be an impossible burden to make monthly student loan payments with limited income on top of medical expenses and the many additional costs of living with a disability.\n\nCurrently, there are no programs that help disabled college graduates manage their student loan debt. Grads with federal loans may qualify for an income-based repayment plan that could help lower their monthly payments, but they can still have a high overall balance on their account due to rising interest rates. Defaulting on student loans can have a dramatic negative impact on your credit score and make it more difficult to do things like buy a car, buy a home, or take out any other loans. If you’re not able to fix the situation by paying the overdue amount, eventually, federal loan agencies can garnish your wages and withhold your tax refunds to pay off the balance.\n\nAs such, programs that ease the burden of student debt would be helpful to everyone, not just disabled college graduates, because they would allow more of the 44 million people in the United States who have student loans to do things like save money for emergencies, buy homes, start businesses, and invest in the economy. And it would be very beneficial to disabled graduates if programs existed to help forgive all or some of their student loan debt, even if they don’t qualify for total discharge and are still working. One option would be implementing programs for disabled people while they’re still students in college to help them not accrue as much debt—programs that offer scholarships and grants even to those on a part-time student schedule or subsidies to help students afford the cost of living so they can graduate with less student debt.\n\nDisabled people have a powerfully positive impact on the world, not just through careers and paid employment, but also through involvement with the community, volunteering, and creating art. And when disabled people aren’t worried that they will have to choose between paying their next student loan payment or paying for the co-pay on their medication, we have the opportunity to thrive, making society richer for all.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

In October 2018, the Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule change to existing laws surrounding immigration known as public charge.\n\nThe idea of public charge was first introduced into U.S. immigration policy in 1882. In current law, under section 212(a)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a person seeking admission to the U.S. or seeking to adjust status to permanent resident is inadmissible if they are deemed “likely at any time to become a public charge.” Someone is considered a public charge if they are “likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense” according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nIn other words, public charge is based on the assumption that people with disabilities will be too expensive for the country we immigrate to, and that it’s more likely we’ll need costly healthcare (Medicaid) or social supports (SNAP and other food assistance, housing subsidies, SSI or SSDI). And therefore, the government believes we shouldn’t be able to legally immigrate.\n\nHow does the proposed public charge rule impact a disabled adult immigrating alone, or a non-disabled family immigrating with a disabled child?\n\nUnder the proposed rule, immigrants with disabilities face an even greater risk of being labeled a public charge. The current public charge law is specific and only includes people who use cash benefits, but the proposed rule change would expand public charge to include non-cash benefits, such as Medicaid, food assistance (i.e. SNAP), and housing subsidies (i.e. Section 8 housing).\n\nAdditionally, the proposed rule provides more guidance to immigration officials who are currently charged with using a “totality of circumstances” test to determine whether someone is likely to become a public charge. The proposal explicitly names five “heavily weighted negative factors” to determine whether someone will be a public charge. The proposal lists only one “heavily weighted positive factor” that relates to how much money the immigrant or a sponsor of the immigrant makes in the U.S.\n\nThe positive factor would be if the applicant meets 250% of the Federal Poverty Line (an income of $62,750 for a four person household).\n\nAccording to the rule change text, negative factors include:\n\nLack of Employability\n\nCurrent Receipt of One of More Public Benefits\n\nReceipt of Public Benefits within 36 months of filing application.\n\nFinancial Means to Pay for Medical Costs\n\nAlien found previously inadmissible or deportable based on public charge\n\n“The proposed rule’s list of negative factors are a thinly veiled attack on people with disabilities,” says Katherine Perez, Co-Founder of the National Coalition for Latinxs with Disabilities and Visiting Professor of Law at Loyola Law School. “Because of structural injustice, people with disabilities are disproportionately unemployed, unable to pay for medical expenses that are not covered under typical insurance plans, and therefore often dependent on using public benefits. This is yet another example of how the law demonizes people with disabilities when it is the law that is responsible for creating disabling conditions.”\n\nBlocking low-income and disabled immigrants could have an expensive impact on the government, as more people choose to forgo Medicaid and insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or parents decide not to take their kids in for check-ups. According to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), public charge could cause as many as 6.8 million non citizens to stop using benefits out of fear.\n\nPublic charge is not just an immigration issue in the United States, either.\n\n“Right after the election, joking about moving to Canada quickly became a thing,” explains Rebecca Cokley, the Director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress. “However, at the time it was not a reality for people with disabilities or chronic health conditions or their families due to Canada’s existing medical inadmissibility policy. The policy determined that because an individual or someone in their family could need access to services, creating an ‘excessive demand’ on social services.”\n\nIn Canada, roughly 361 immigration cases a year were refused from 2013 to 2016 because of the excessive demand provision in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Under Section 38(1)(c) of the Act, an immigrant or refugee could be deemed inadmissible if their pre-existing medical conditions could cause an excessive demand on Canada’s health or social services. An excessive demand is defined as exceeding an average Canadian per capita health fee of just under $6,655 annually.\n\nThat changed in 2018, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration announced wanting to reform Canada’s immigration policy to make it easier for people with disabilities and their family to immigrate to Canada. These major reforms to Canada’s immigration policy were announced by Canada’s Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen.\n\nThe changes to the law will alter the definition of social services and remove references to special education, social and vocational rehabilitation services, and personal support services—and triple the cost threshold (to $20,000) at which an application for permanent residence can be denied on medical grounds. These changes will make it so that special education, rehabilitation services, and personal support services no long count against applicants, and makes it easier for both disabled individuals and families of disabled children to apply for permanent resident status.\n\nThese changes make it considerably easier for people with disabilities and families of disabled children immigrating to Canada. Samrat Saha, 38, and his family were denied residency in Canada in May 2017 because their son has autism. Saha can now reapply for permanent residency.\n\nAdvocacy groups in Canada like the HIV/AIDS Legal Network, Council of Canadians with Disabilities, and the Migrant Workers Alliance don’t think the changes to the law go far enough, and the government should eliminate medical inadmissibility altogether.\n\nOne family, the Warkentins, moved from Colorado to Manitoba in 2013, but their application for permanent residency was denied because their six-year-old daughter has epilepsy and an intellectual disability. The Warkentins had already gotten involved with their local church and community, invested over $600,000 to the Canadian economy, and planned to open a hunting and fishing lodge business. Their contributions weren’t considered with their application, only the potential cost to the Canadian government. Advocates say this will continue under the new changes to the law. According to immigration critic Jenny Kwan, 25 percent of all immigrants with pre-existing conditions could still face discrimination.\n\nHow can we reform immigration policies to make them fairer?\n\n“Many of the reasons people with disabilities immigrate are the same as for people without disabilities,” says Rebecca Cokley. “In addition to being a fundamental human right for all people to be able to decide where one wants to live, for people with disabilities, the chance to access better services, access an education (which in some parts of the world is still inaccessible or completely absent for people with disabilities,) be able to move about society is life-changing.”\n\nCokley recommends making the immigration process simpler across the board. “I think finding ways to simplify the immigration process overall would benefit all people immigrating,” she says. “Immigration policies and procedures vary depending on where you are coming from, but across the board they are complex and require a lot of paperwork. The process itself is also expensive with many individuals and families spending their life savings to make it possible.”\n\nShe explains that public charge rules are driven by the need to determine who is worthy and who isn’t by factors including race, health, class, education, disability, and others.\n\nThese rules make wealth and ability preconditions for entering the U.S. or obtaining a green card—so the current administration is, in the words of Azza Altiraifi in a fact sheet from the Center for American Progress, “entrenching systemic disparities which favor white, wealthy and non-disabled immigrant communities.”\n\nWe all have the power to advocate against public charge and stop the proposed rule change in the United States. If you’re interested in taking action, you can comment on the proposed public charge rule. The Department of Homeland Security will be taking comments until December 10, 2018. It’s critical that the disability community and beyond send in as many comments explaining why the public charge rule change is discriminatory.\n\nDisabled people are human beings and have the right to immigrate safely to the United States and other countries just like non-disabled people do. People with disabilities make meaningful contributions both financially and in other ways like community involvement, art, and volunteer work, but our value as immigrants also shouldn’t be solely judged by our ability to contribute. Our differences shouldn’t make us less welcome.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

As a kid, it meant that I sometimes went to occupational therapy to practice my cursive handwriting and speech. As an adult, it might take a few minutes for me to recognize someone I don’t see very often, or I’ll laugh at a joke a second off-beat because it took my brain some time to ‘hear’ it. Sometimes I ask questions about one topic when the person is already onto the next, or I’m walking and don’t hear someone call out my name.\n\nHere’s what I wish people knew about what it’s like to live with sensory processing disorder:\n\nCommunication & Listening\n\nPlease be patient with me if I don’t hear you (correctly or at all) the first time. This goes double if we’re talking on the phone, or we’re in a crowded or noisy place. I might have difficulty understanding what you’re saying or it take take me a few minutes.\n\nA lot of things are hilarious. Especially things I misheard, misread, or didn’t pronounce correctly. I like to laugh at myself. Not everyone’s like that, though, so check in with someone before you turn their faux pas into an inside joke.\n\nWhen I’m overloaded (or under-stimulated), I might forget things. I might say things that don’t make sense. I might repeat information, ask more questions than usual, ask you to confirm things, or sound confused. Please bear with me until I’m in a better space sensory-wise.\n\nPlease don’t tell me something “isn’t that bad” or make any kind of judgment about a sensory environment without asking me. Let me check it out for myself.\n\nI love it when people are genuinely empathetic—even if you have no sensory processing issues at all—and willing to listen to me and try to understand. It means the world to me when, for example, my partner lets me tell her about why I’m having a tough time driving that day and would prefer to walk, or when a friend lets me complain about how I’ve been struggling to find the right words for a few hours.\n\nEnvironment\n\nSensory processing issues can be all over the place. I can spot a cool outfit a few blocks away and also not see a bicyclist coming in my peripheral vision.\n\nSensory processing challenges can be physically painful. If I get overloaded, I can get debilitating migraines, feel dizzy, and have nausea and stomach pains. Sometimes I need to take a sick day from work and social life and lay down in a dark room.\n\nIf I’m asking to make a change to my environment or leave, I’m being serious. A request isn’t just me politely asking, it means I need it. I can’t function sitting at a desk in the middle of an open office, or listen to your long, serious story in a loud nightclub.\n\nAdults have sensory processing issues, too. This is a lifelong situation, no matter the diagnosis. We may learn better coping strategies and know best how to seek out environments that work for us—but we still have it. I won’t grow out of this, and I’ll be asking to turn off the bright overhead lights when I’m 80.\n\nAny time I ask to be in a specific seat in a room or choose to face a certain direction, it’s on purpose. If I’m totally comfortable anywhere, it won’t matter. But if you see me asking for or seeking out that one seat, there’s a reason.\n\nSensory processing issues sometimes run my life. I’ve had to cancel plans, change my work/school environment, take sick days, and map out my travel around my sensory environment.\n\nOne of the major reasons I work remotely is because I can totally control the sensory environment at home—and I’m SO much more effective when 100% of my focus is on my work, and not the music blaring from the desk next to me or a phone ringing down the hall. This isn’t true for all people with sensory processing issues, but it’s a legitimate reason to choose remote work.\n\nIt helps a lot if you offer me alternatives. Instead of, “Let’s go to this restaurant,” it could be, “Here are three restaurants I was thinking of. What would you like?” Instead of, “We’re all getting together to plan our volunteering at the library, bring a laptop,” say, “We’re all getting together to plan our volunteering. Where would you be comfortable meeting?”\n\nTransportation\n\nDriving is a challenge—or at least it can be for many of us. If someone tells you they don’t drive or only drive under certain conditions, believe them and don’t give them the fifth degree.\n\nEvery single person with sensory processing issues is not the same. My friend wears earplugs on the subway, while the subway noise doesn’t bother me. But then I have serious trouble with driving in crowded cities, and he’s fine with it.\n\nIf you’re someone who runs, jogs, or bicycles, please remember that not everyone can see and hear you coming. (Beyond people like me with sensory processing disorder, there are also blind, visually impaired, d/Deaf, and hearing impaired people!) Don’t get upset with someone if they don’t get out of the way in time. Approach other people with the knowledge that they might not be able to see you running up beside them, or hear you yell out, “On the left!”\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m a person. The best way you can support me is to remember that I’m me, and always ask what I need or want in the moment. Instead of assuming, listen to people with sensory processing issues and ask us what we need.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

I dress whimsically in colorful outfits with a lot of patterns and he’d never seen me use my cane before, so I explained that I started using it because of a disability.\n\nBut there have also been situations where I’ve been asked by complete strangers if my cane is a part of a costume or my fashion and if I “really need it.”\n\nWhen Halloween season is in full swing, I’m less likely to be given any space while I’m walking through a crowd with my cane or offered a seat on public transportation. I have no way of knowing if that’s because so many other people are wearing disabilities as Halloween costumes or not—but it certainly seems that way.\n\n“My wrist braces are the only visible indication of my disability,” says Ashley, who works in technology. “When people assume I’m wearing them for fashion, I have to be vocal several times a day about getting a seat, getting assistance in train stations or airports, taking a bit more time to get up, and not getting shoved or grabbed.” Ashley has commonly seen wrist braces used as part of Halloween costumes.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with making your mobility aid or assistive device or disability a part of your costume if you actually have a disability, but it becomes an issue when non-disabled people treat things like canes, eye patches, and mental illness like costumes that can be put on for a night.\n\n“The problem arises that by singling out an entire set of humans based solely on their mental illnesses or body images that differ from some perceived notion of normal is inherently belittling and ultimately dehumanizing,” explains Oji Dannelley, a professional dancer, freelance writer, and educator who uses a wheelchair. “It is a statement that takes an already marginalized group and turns the reality of their lives into a form of entertainment.”\n\nWalk into any Halloween store and you’re bound to see ableist costumes and props. These costumes are ableist because they assume that non-disabled people will be wearing them for a night or a few and then taking them off. They make light of the reality that disabled people live with—whether it’s fighting for wheelchair access, discrimination against mental illness, or difficulty getting adequate healthcare.\n\nAs Danni Green, a professional accessibility specialist, an activist with disabilities, and an Expressive Arts Therapy student in Boston, MA, explains, Halloween costumes generally fall into one of three categories: Something you wish you could be, something scary, or something funny. “When people use accessibility tools as part of their costume, nobody thinks they’re dressing up as something they wish they could be—they’re portraying disability as something scary or something funny, and either way, it’s harmful to real people whose disabilities should be treated as neither scary nor funny,” ze says.\n\nDanni recently watched a video of someone in costume as a famous person who was blind in one eye and wore an eyepatch. Danni says that although ze has a different kind of acquired partial blindness and doesn’t wear an eyepatch, it was upsetting to see the costume. “Losing my vision was one of the most traumatic things that’s ever happened to me,” says Danni. “Is that really a fun costume you want to put on and gallivant around in?”\n\nThese costumes impact real disabled people, causing others to question whether our disabilities are a costume or a prop and believing that we don’t actually need a mobility aid or a white cane. These implications are even trickier considering that people with disabilities already are regularly accused of “faking” our conditions, and people often jump to the conclusion that young or ambulatory people don’t need mobility aids.\n\n“I’m still disabled on Halloween,” Danni explains. “If people can’t tell the difference between my real cane and someone’s costume cane, they may not recognize that I really need them to move out of my way or give up a seat on the train.”\n\nOji often cosplays at science fiction and fantasy conventions as characters who use wheelchairs or incorporates her chair into her costume. “My first year I started with Oracle (a storyline that has BatGirl as a chair user) and people kept asking me, ‘Is that chair PART of the costume?’” Oji says. “The thought that a disabled person would want to cosplay a disabled superhero was not even on their radar.”\n\nFor costumes portraying mental illnesses—such as sexy mental hospital patient or anorexia—it further stigmatizes mental health issues. People who receive inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment already face serious discrimination and costumes like this perpetuate the false idea that people with mental illnesses are scary or might physically hurt you.\n\nInstead of choosing to support retailers that are selling disabilities as a costume, we should focus our energy on making sure that Halloween and fall seasonal events are accessible for everyone. We can put our efforts into sensory-friendly events, widespread wheelchair access, fragrance-free policies and education, and destigmatizing disability.\n\nAlaina Leary\n\nAbout Rooted In Rights\n\nRooted in Rights exists to amplify the perspectives of the disability community.

I had a lot of questions, but my main one was: Is this going to be accessible to me? Can I actually do all this? What happens if I can’t?\n\nConversations around accessibility and accommodations are commonplace when discussing traditional high schools, but attending a vocational, technical, or agricultural high school adds an extra layer of challenges.
