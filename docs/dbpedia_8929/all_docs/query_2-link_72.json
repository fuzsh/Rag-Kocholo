        "text": "It might be something in the water but Scandinavian musicians don’t merely cross musical boundaries, they flat out refuse to recognize their existence. Anyone familiar with Terje Rypdal, Bugge Wesseltoft, Nils Petter Molvaer, Eivind Aarset, and yes, Yngwie Malmsteen is aware that they all comfortably straddle genres from metal to classical, jazz to hip-hop, free improv to folk without batting an eye.\n\nNorwegian guitarist Knut Værnes is solidly in this tradition; over more than a decade and half a dozen solo records he has revealed a mastery of Nordic ambience, whammy-bar fusion, Scofield-style post-bop, and a host of other musical metiers—sometimes all on the same CD. As an outlet for his various visions he created the Curling Legs label which now comprises well over one hundred titles. Many of those recordings are CDs by other guitarists including Bjørn Klakegg, who makes his own instruments and creates pastoral musical landscapes of surprising depth, and Tellef Øgrim, a fretless guitarist offering postmodern jazz-fusion.\n\nI asked Værnes about his influences, label, and recording, 4G, one of the great all-guitar-all-the-time festivals featuring four of Scandinavia’s finest fret board wranglers.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLine 6 has been constantly improving this concept since its inception. This new update, with the ability to turn the guitar knobs into controllers for the POD HD, could help tip the Variax from a useful tool for reproducing a variety of studio sounds live, toward a means of creating a world of new expressive tones. Thoughts?\n\nOne or two hundred years ago guitarists like Mick Barr and Kevin Hufnagel would likely still have spent hours and days cloistered in their rooms. Had they lived back then they would have been composing symphonies or strings quartets, influenced by masters Mozart and Bach. Instead, as children of our electronic age, they were raised on a diet of screaming electric guitars. So while their music exhibits many of the attributes of the classical genre: long form, through composed, and technically demanding; instead of violins, flutes and clarinets, we get Gibson SGs cranked through distortion.\n\nIf Jimi had lived might he have eschewed frets at some point in favor of an extra measure of expression? If he had he might have sounded something like this.\n\nOn April 15th, 2012 , Chris Buono (Karsh Kale, Lithium Tree) rocked a set of Jimi Hendrix tunes on his fretless Excalibur Surfreter Supra. An SRO crowd at the annual Brookdale Guitar Show was treated to cuts from classic Hendrix albums: Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold As Love, and Electric Ladyland . Buono was joined by Tobias Ralph (Adrian Belew) on drums, Steve Jenkins (Vernon Reid) on bass, and Eryn Shewell on vocals.\n\nContinue reading →"
