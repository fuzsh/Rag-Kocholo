        "text": "753\n\nIt’s apparently been around for a few years, but I recently found out about the remarkable Bob Dylan Project web site. It’s as thorough an overview of his music as you could imagine, with information about every song he ever has recorded, plus links to streams of the actual recordings (both the original and alternate and live versions). On top of that, there are also links to covers of his songs by more than 4,000 artists.\n\nI’ve enjoyed cruising around the site — I imagine any fan would — and, in particular, hearing new version of his songs that I had not previously been aware of. And the experience has inspired me to put together this list of 20 of his songs by Jersey artists.\n\nI had been aware of some of them, previously. But in many cases, I heard them for the first time by spending some time with thebobdylanproject.com.\n\nThere are many other Dylan covers by New Jersey artists, of course. But these, I feel, are 20 of the best (with the limit of only one song per artist).\n\nI’m not sure why, but many of these songs are not really the most obvious cover choices. Maybe that says something about the state’s musicians.\n\nHere they are, listed alphabetically, by artist.\n\nRichard Barone: “I’ll Keep It With Mine”\n\nBon Jovi: “Seven Days”\n\nNeal Casal: “Property of Jesus”\n\nThe Four Seasons: “Mr. Tambourine Man”\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem: “Changing of the Guards”\n\nEmily Grove, with David Ford: “Oh, Sister”\n\nPat Guadagno and Tired Horses: “Abandoned Love”\n\nThe Isley Brothers: “Lay, Lady, Lay”\n\nBettye LaVette: “Everything Is Broken”\n\nR. Stevie Moore: “Who Killed Davey Moore?”\n\nMy Chemical Romance: “Desolation Row”\n\nThe Myddle Class: “Gates of Eden”\n\nSuzzy and Maggie Roche: “Clothes Line Saga”\n\nEryn Shewell and Pat Ruh: “You Angel You”\n\nPatti Smith: “Drifter’s Escape”\n\nBruce Springsteen: “I Want You”\n\nJack Tannehill: “Emotionally Yours”\n\nTony Trischka, with Druhá Travá: “Nashville Skyline Rag”\n\nYo La Tengo: “I Threw It All Away”\n\nThe Young Rascals: “Like a Rolling Stone”"
