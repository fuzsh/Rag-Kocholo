        "text": "Family Testimonials\n\nI wanted to let you know that we stayed at the Montage at Palmetto Bluff a couple of weeks back and we had Ms. Lee babysit our one year old and she was amazing!!! My son loved her and she was all around terrific in every way. We highly recommend her!\n\n~Spire family - New York, NY\n\nBeth was amazing. My oldest asked for her even when we were back in NYC. My youngest, who is currently going through a phase where he doesn't like anyone, had fun and liked her very much. She was timely, nice, fun and thorough. On the second night we had her, I thought we would have to come back periodically to feed, put them to bed, etc and we never had to come back. She exceeded our expectations.\n\n~Watts Family; (NY; NY)\n\nShe was fantastic! On time, courteous, and ready to play with our kids! Our 6 year old and 8 year old loved her!\n\n~Luechtefeld Family; (Valencia; CA)\n\nI had a business meeting in Savannah that I needed to bring my dental team to and my baby was still nursing. I found out from the hotel about your service and received prompt return calls & emails to all of my questions. A very nice young woman named Thati came to the hotel all 3 of the days I needed for my 11 month old son. She always came a few minutes early to go over any details about his care schedule. My son had a great time with her. He loves to go outside so I had brought both a stroller & a front pack to carry him. Thati took him to the park, out for walks & out for lunch. She made sure to keep his nap & bedtime schedule & worked with me so she would be at the room on my meeting breaks for nursing. At the end of each babysitting day she had filled out a report that told me everything they did, what he ate, diapers changed, behaviors she observed ect... it was reassuring as a mom to know I was leaving him in professional, kind, safe care while I was at my meeting. Thank you!\n\n~VanHart Family; (Petersburg; PA) NO\n\nWe used a Guardian Angel sitter for 3 children. The sitter was polite, caring and very courteous. The 3 kids were tucked into bed and sleeping soundly when we returned. We will definitely use this service again. Children are ages 4,5,and 7.\n\n~Stone Family; (Blandon; PA)\n\nThe Guardian Angels made the business portion of my trip to Savannah, GA easy as the sitter cared for my children right at our hotel. They had a nice day.\n\n~Holstine Family; (NY; NY)\n\nWe used Guardian Angels twice during our vacation in North and South Carolina. We had a sitter for our 2 year old daughter in Charleston, SC so that my husband and I could go to a nice restaurant for dinner one evening. Our sitter was friendly and listened intently to our instructions. She kept in touch with us while we were out, and I was reassured to know my daughter was sound asleep at 8 pm, her usual bedtime. We had another sitter in Hilton Head who also did a great job.\n\n~Barone Family; (Towson; MD)\n\nOn a family vacation with my canersen@gmail.com children and grand kids and wanted a night out, minus grand kids.\n\nHeard some good things about Guardian Angels and wanted to give them a shot.\n\nGreat decision. Sitter was on time, great attitude and we all felt the kids were in good hands.\n\nWould definitely use service again.\n\n~Campanaro Family; (Woodland Park, NJ)\n\nExtremely easy to do business with. Your sitters have all been incredibly trust worthy, very friendly with children, and experienced. We would most definitely use the service again.\n\n~Gabrini Family; (Aurora, ON)\n\nCarol was amazing! Thank you, Julie, for being so efficient at finding a sitter for our 10 month old fairly last minute. Our son took to Carol right away and we were so thankful to have her there with him for 2 nights during our stay in Kiawah for a wedding. Carol was super personable, experienced and I felt 100% confident in her abilities with our little one. She even gave him a bath both nights, which I so appreciated. We have family in Bluffton and will absolutely use this service again when we visit! THANK YOU!\n\n~Thompson Family; (Nashville, TN)\n\nNatalia took really good care of my son! They went on nature walks and scavenger hunts. She really went over and beyond!! Worth every penny!\n\n~Lagergren Family; (Gulf Breeze, FL)\n\nWe, Sandy and I, have used Guardian Angels on many occasions to watch over our own children. They provide certified, competent and overly attentive babysitters who make sure your #1 prize possession is well cared for and safe and sound when you return. They are the definite “go to” company for making sure you have peace of mind while out taking a little time for yourself. Be sure and tell them Chris and Sandy Walker sent you, they will take especially good care of you and your loved ones.\n\nHilton Head Rental Resource\n\nhttps://hiltonheadrentalresource.com/\n\nI contacted the service to see if they could help us on our vacation with our special needs son. They replied back that it shouldn't be a problem. I was looking forward to having real vacation time for the first time. But I was skeptical due to past experiences. A couple weeks before they sent kathys profile and it looked like a good match. When she got there I was relieved. She knew the \"lingo\" and all the right ??? To ask. She was fun and easygoing. I think my son enjoyed the time away from me! A good problem to have. We have scheduled our next vacation the same place the same time of year next year so we can have Kathy’s help again even more next year.\n\n~Jottinger Family; (Winchester; VA)\n\nThe service was very easy to book and to confirm. We received information about our sitter, including her photo, well ahead of time. Our sitter was ahead of time and was prepared for our high energy 4 year old. At the outset, the sitter went over what we expected the Rules to be (as to bedtime, diet, etc). Once all was set, they were off to explore. During the night we received frequent updates and timely responses to our requests. The sitter was very professional, highly flexible, and a delight to have watch our child.\n\n~Duffy Family; (N. Charleston; SC)\n\nKim was wonderful. My boys loved her. She taught my younger son to play \"Go Fish\". She spent the whole time playing with them. She even took them to the pool. I highly recommend Kim. She really knows kids and how to entertain them. We are very happy with Guardian Angels sitting service. We would definitely recommend your service to our friends, family, and etc.\n\n~Isbell Family; (Decatur; GA)\n\nWe had never left our 9 month old with someone other than family, so we were nervous when we traveled for a friend's wedding. But booking a sitter was easy and I was reassured at every step of the way our little guy would be in good hands. Our sitter was amazing!!\n\n~Fendrick Family; (Papillion; NE)\n\nWe have used Guardian Angels for the past 2 years for our annual summer vacation in Hilton Head. We are always super nervous with childcare, especially in a state where we know nobody! However, once we met both our caregivers, we knew our daughter would be well taken care of! The caregivers are punctual, responsible, compassionate, and loving. They provide complete attention to our daughter and keep her entertained! We have no complaints, and we will definitely use Guardian Angels again!\n\n~Anderson Family; (Richmond; VA)\n\nWe loved Thati! She was so nice and the girls really enjoyed her. We would definitely use Guardian Angels again in the future and we would request Thati!!!\n\n~Hill Family; (Marietta, GA)\n\nHello! I just wanted to say how much we loved having Thati babysit for our children. Not only did they both love and look forward to her babysitting, but so did my husband and I. She was so sweet and attentive to my kids. She was confident with my kids in the best way and I felt so at ease when she was with them. Thati is fun and silly and sweet and smart. I really can't say enough how comfortable she made my husband and I about leaving our children with a great babysitter. I wish she lived in my town because my kids are asking about when they can see her again! Thank you.\n\n~Laverty Family; (Wilmington, NC)\n\nCarol was amazing. She arrived early and made these first time parents with a sitter for the first time feel comfortable. My sweet boy was happily asleep and we'll fed when we returned. She gave us a full report of all activities while she was with our son.\n\nI wish we had a Carol in our town!\n\n~Pendragon Family; (Charlotte, NC)\n\nOur sitter Jamie was such a pleasant surprise. I scheduled her for my brother's 3 children as he was getting married at the Sonesta Resort that Saturday. He is a police officer and understandably he was very nervous leaving his children to someone he did not know. She immediately thanked my brother Jeremy for his service as a police officer. She was as comfortable and as trustworthy as family. His son Jayce had a great time playing games with her. Such a wonderful experience.\n\n~Shafer Family;\n\nWe loved Jessica. The boys had a great time and she showed incredible maturity.\n\n~Landman Family; (Setauket, NY)\n\nJessica was great! We really loved her. Thanks again.\n\n~Holcomb Family; (Greensboro, NC)\n\nAmazing concept and service.\n\n~Danziger Family; (Brooklyn, NY)\n\nJust wanted to let you know how pleased we were with Autumn and your service. We highly recommend her.\n\n~Goldman Family; (Palm Beach Gardens, FL)\n\nThe sitter was lovely. She came early so we got to talk and get to know her a little better. As well as introduce her to my son while I was still around to see them interact. It turned and nerve-racking experience into a pleasant one.\n\n~Gaston Family; (Houston, TX)\n\nBeyond thrilled with our babysitter!!\n\n~Valentine Family; (Broadview Heights, OH)\n\nThank you Guardian Angels. You made it easy to arrange to have someone watch 5 kids at the same time. And Louise was so fabulous I have considered moving to SC just to hire her again!\n\n~Ofner family; (Clarksburg, MD)\n\nI needed sitting services at the last minute for a conference in Myrtle Beach. I could not get through on the telephone line since it was late Sunday evening, however, I left an email and Melissa called me back immediately and told me she would try her best to find someone. She found someone to assist me all three days within about 20-30 minutes. The young lady she sent was absolutely perfect for my girls, they ADORED her! We ended up using the same young lady for the entire conference and I was one happy momma!\n\n~Taylor Family; (Blythewood, SC)\n\nGuardian Angels Sitting Service was a huge help at my wedding. The sitters arrived promptly and took great care of the children so that their parents good enjoy the wedding. The service was easy to arrange, I received prompt replies, and they were flexible with booking, especially so close to the wedding. Once they confirmed the sitters, they even sent me a profile of the sitters who would be taking care of the children. All the sitters were very well qualified. I recommend this sitting service anytime!\n\n~Dunbar Family; (Johns Island; SC)\n\nLouise R. was wonderful! She was attentive, kind, professional, and very sweet with my 1 year old son. She knew the area well and took him on walks, fed him, and put him to sleep with no issue. I would request her again in a heartbeat if we come back to Bluffton for vacation. Thank you Louise!\n\n~Blaha Family; (Chicago; IL)\n\nI came to savanna Georgia on a business trip and I didn't know anyone in this town or state. And the event which I was suppose to attend was strictly 18 and older. My baby sitter was was suppose to come with me backed out last min.once I got to the hotel and asked they hotel receptionist if they provide any service like this so they suggested me Gaurdian Angels Service. Everything went very smooth. They called me and send me the profile for the sitter. She was in time took good care of my daughter. My daughter loved her. She texted me and gave me the updates while I was gone. If I come back to Savannah I would like her to baby sit Krystal. it was a great experience and thank you for everything. Y'all are doing a great job providing this service.\n\n~Antao Family; (Katy; TX) -\n\nWe were very pleased with our experience with Guardian Angels. We used them twice on our vacation Hilton Head. Our sitter Deb was on time, extremely polite and great with our kids. She brought a bag of crafts and coloring books and the kids enjoyed their time with her. We would not hesitate to use Guardian Angels again.\n\n~Beshara Family; ( Katonah, NY)\n\nHelen was so wonderful with our children. This was actually our first non family babysitter and our kids had such a wonderful time. We booked her for 2 nights and my 4 year old both invited her to spend the night and visit us in Florida as he liked her so much! Our 2 year old has had separation anxiety and given childcare quite the hassle in the past but he also took right to her. She texted us updates so we weren't worried and could enjoy our night out. Upon return she gave us a full report before leaving. She really went the extra mile and found out they loved Star Wars and showed up with coloring books and stickers and markers the 2nd night. We will definitely use this service again where available and will request Helen when I the HHI area.\n\n~Anonymous\n\nBeth was phenomenal! She looked after my 13mn old daughter and juggled watching my 5mn old nephew at the same time, which is a lot to juggle. The kids took to her instantly and we knew they were in good hands. Beth took great notes about the kids routine and we all felt as if we could enjoy ourselves while Beth was watching them. I highly recommend her and the Guardian Angels service!\n\n~Weicher Family; (Chicago, IL)\n\nMelissa made the difference in my decision to try the service for last minute care.\n\nI was apprehensive to trust anyone with the care of my children. Melissa provided objective, yet caring support in my decision of the best sitter(s) for our family. It was because of Melissa's support that I took a leap of faith and joined as an annual member. It is like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.\n\nThank you, Melissa, and Guardian Angels!!!\n\n~Hall Family; (Rincon, GA)\n\nDenise did a fabulous job on Saturday. She had a lot of curve balls thrown at her, as our house is being remodeled. She had to improvise and get our kids to sleep on an air mattress in our guest house. No problem! She brought her own toys (so smart, as kids are always bored with their own stuff, not to mention my kids room is a disastrous construction zone). She brought crafts, and immediately engaged my two year old upon her arrival. Even though we didnât leave for our event until about an hour after she came to the home, Phillip paid no attention to me as I rushed around getting ready. He barely noticed when I left. She managed to cook for them, bathe them, and get them to sleep without incident (tasks I do not always manage to accomplish so well). Denise is certainly an asset to your team. Thanks for making a night out possible for my husband and me.\n\n~Pfuhl Family; (Bluffton, SC)\n\nGreat service, great people, great babysitter!\n\n~Ingber Family; (Hewlett, NY)\n\nGuardian Angels Sitting Service provided warm and loving care for my son while we were in Savannah longer than expected because of Hurricane Sandy. Their service was a pleasure to work with and put my mind at ease when I had to leave my son in someone else's care. I would highly recommend them.\n\n~Sacks Family; (NY,NY)\n\nMelissa is wonderful. She is so fast and always helps out where she can. I am so often having do to last minute bookings and she always gets back to us swiftly with a response.\n\nOur Sitter is so lovely. She has become part of our family. I am now finding that my Daughter is asking if Theresa can come and play today several times of the week now because she loves her so much. It is always lovely to know that you can happily go out on a date night or go to a work function and know that your daughter is happy and in safe hands.\n\nThank you Guardian Angels\n\n~Debreceny Family; (Savannah, GA)\n\nMiss Beth was wonderful! She was so kind and gentle with the kids and with me as well. I felt so comfortable leaving our 2 year old and 5 month old with her. The 2 year old is still talking about Miss Beth.\n\n~Anonymous\n\nVery easy to work with. Great service over the phone. The charges weren't as clear up front as I would have liked, but I received explanations. Invisible service for my wedding, exactly what it should be for an event like we had. Thanks again!\n\n~Alshouse Family; (Atlanta, GA)\n\nOur experience with Guardian Angels was amazing. I don't ever take the time to review restaurants or products but I had to take a minute to share that we could not have been happier or more comfortable with Beth, our assigned babysitter. Our son loved her and was asking about her the next day and when we returned home from our vacation. She allowed my wife and me to completely relax and enjoy ourselves knowing that our children were in great hands. She is the highest qualified caretaker of our children, ourselves included : )\n\nTo go on vacation and have a woman that teaches 4 year olds and is an assistant principal is really a dream situation. She brought all kinds of fun things for our son and even cleaned up our vacation house. A+ rating and I've already recommended the service to friends.\n\n~Mirabito Family; (Miami,FL)\n\nI have used Guardian Angels the past two years for our family vacations in Ocean City, NJ and it was a great experience. My kids loved the sitter each time. Both girls were cheerful and ready to play. I have recommended GSS to many of my friends with kids.\n\n~McGuire Family; (Collingswood, NJ)\n\nGood overall experience...definitely would use guardian angels for my precious grandchildren again.\n\n~Warhaftig Family; (NY, NY)\n\nAndrea exceeded my expectations. She arrived 15 minutes early and I knew immediately my boys liked her. I will use this service again.\n\n~Cavanaugh Family; (Hilton Head, SC)\n\nShe was wonderful! The kids had a great time!\n\n~Homier Family; (Hope MIlls, NC)\n\nI really enjoyed my experience with GA's. They were very professional and my 2 yr old son had a great time! Would love to use them again in Atlanta.\n\n~Khabeer Family; (Atlanta, GA)\n\nWe were a little worried about having a stranger babysit our 8 year old son, but as soon as we met Beth we knew he would be fine. She obviously loves children. She arrived at our hotel armed with age appropriate toys that Sam talked about for the next 2 days. They went for a bike ride. treasure hunt. swimming and they had dinner together. since we've been home he's told everyone how lovely Beth was and he wants to go back to see her. We would recommend Guardian Angels to anyone that needs a sitter.\n\n~Watson Family; (Bermuda)\n\nClaudie was very fun and my kids had a blast! Thanks!\n\n~Leffew Family; ( Hilton Head, SC)\n\nThis was our first time using a service and we loved it!

Would recommend the service to anyone.\n\n~Dorsey Family; (Arlington, VA)\n\nGuardian angels is a well run professional organization. This was the first time using this service. I felt that Sandee C. took very good care of my dog and I would recommend Guardian Angels and definitely use them again\n\n~Anonymous\n\nI would highly recommend this service to anyone visiting HIlton Head. Our sitter was exceptional, we felt very comfortable leaving our little ones in her hands!\n\n~Murphy Family; (Columbia, SC)\n\nWe had never used a service like this before but were attending an out of town wedding and needed a sitter. All aspects of the service, from the booking process to the actual sitting services, were highly professional. We felt confident our children were well cared for and our three kids had fun. We highly recommend this service.\n\n~Vogler Family; (Raleigh, NC)\n\nThey did a wonderful job with my 9 month old!\n\n~Brawdy Family; (Ludowici, GA)\n\nTaylor was great. Timely, fun, and took great care of our 2 year-old daughter, including a wonderful walk on the beach.\n\n~Vasileff Family; (Plymouth, MI)\n\nExtremely pleased with our sitter, Kim! I had never left my kids, 1 & 3, with a sitter I did not know personally but Kim was great and allowed my husband and I to enjoy dinner dates on our vacation, knowing our kids were well cared for and happy!\n\n~Falk Family; (Houston, TX)\n\nGreat First Experience.\n\n~Ceasar Family; (Savannah, GA)\n\nOur son loved Grandpa George and making a sand keychain.\n\n~Ryznic Family; (Richmond Hill, GA)\n\nDesiree arrived early, paid careful attention to all the instructions, did a great job watching our 11-mo old (who can be a handful) and wrote us a great note telling us about how they spent the afternoon, exactly what he ate and when, and when he went to sleep. She kept him entertained with a variety of activities including play time outside and some relaxed story time. It was so nice to come home to find our son sleeping soundly and a hotel room that was clean and tidy. Definitely one of the best sitter experiences we've had.\n\n~Anonymous\n\nSusan was wonderful. We actually had a small medical emergency--one of my daughters had an infected cut on her foot and I had to take her to an urgent care clinic--and Susan stepped right in and helped me manage the chaos that ensued. She brought games for the kids and kept detailed notes on their bedtimes, meals, etc. She really saved me in what could have been a disastrous situation.

I was able to enjoy a relaxing evening with my husband knowing that my children were safe and having fun!\n\n~Thomas Family; (Huntingdon, PA)\n\nVery friendly services.\n\n~Buonopane Family; (Savannah, GA)\n\nIt was nice to get away by ourselves for a while and I think our kids liked it too!\n\n~Roemer Family; (Lebanon, OH)\n\nWe had two different sitters on two different days. They were both GREAT with our twins. We will use this service again. I highly recommend it.\n\n~Young Family; (Hilton Head, SC)\n\nLashonda was delightful!

I am beyond protective of my girls but I trust my daughter to report back to me if anything bad has occurred to either her or her sister, and she has told me nothing but nice things about the ladies who had watched her for those few hours.

Thank you!\n\n~Felch Family (North Charleston, SC)\n\nLori was wonderful! We were staying in a hotel with our son and she brought games and toys to play with him!

She really came through as Beth was absolutely wonderful! Our 3-year-old is a little tentative with strangers at first but as soon as she pulled out a fishing pole with fish they could catch I knew everything would be just fine and so did he - he didn't even notice us leaving! She had a wonderful energy, sent us texts during the evening with photos showing the fun they had and letting us know all was well. When we arrived home, Beth (who is an Assistant Principal and teacher at a local private school) provided really helpful feedback on his learning and interactions which was so wonderful as we are first-time parents and really appreciated her professional impressions - so fantastic! Highly recommend Guardian Angels and Beth. Thank you!\n\n~Sumner Family; (Charleston, SC)\n\nVeneice was wonderful! She communicated well and promptly with us. My children had a lot of fun!

We will continue to use this service when traveling to the area!\n\n~Reeves family; (Forrest City, Arkansas)\n\nSuzanne was wonderful with the children. They had fun and felt safe. When Suzanne realized that the hotel did not have swim vests, she went out that evening, on her own time, to pick them up (as well as some snacks)and brought them the next day. Awesome sitter!\n\n~Friedman family; (Sea Cliff, NY)\n\nLauren was prompt and polite.\n\n~Withrow family; (Lyndhurst, OH)\n\nGiovanna was great, our children had a terrific time while we enjoyed a night out.\n\n~Engel family; (Lexington, MA)\n\nWe had such a great experience with Guardian Angels babysitting service. We used them during our Rock n Roll Marathon to babysit 3 children and my kids did not want our babysitter Kim leave. To be honest I was very concerned at first to hire a babysitting service in a town where I do not know anyone but Guardian Angels where so professional. They sent me our sitter resume with the picture ahead of time and I was able to read this to the kids and show them a picture so they where at ease when Kim arrived. All their sitters are background check which was very important to us. We will definitively use them next year again. And thank you Kim for such a professional service. My kids loved all the crafts you made with them.\n\n~Woods family; (Waterford, VA )\n\nI was a nervous wreck to leave my 7 month old- I have never left her! We attended a marriage retreat in Savannah, sponsored by the Army. Before the retreat they answered all my questions via the phone and were very reassuring when we dropped her off. The ladies were kind and tried to comfort her when she cried because she was in a strange place. I felt they did everything they could of done to comfort our baby. During the rough times they never seemed to lose patience or get annoyed, they also didn't jut put her in a crib and let her cry- they held her the whole time trying to give her reassurance.\n\nI was very pleased !\n\n~Dixon family ; (Sumter, SC )\n\nExcellent service from start to finish. Would use the service again in a heartbeat. Beth came with a basket of toys and books and my daughter was so excited. Didn't even notice that we left.\n\nMy daughter got sick while she was sleeping. Beth noticed while checking on her after she had fallen asleep. She gave her a bath, changed sheets and PJs and was getting her back to bed.\n\nTop notch service!!\n\n~Drackett family; (New York, NY)\n\nI had a great experience with Guardian Angels. I traveled with my one year old daughter to Savannah for work. I was so thankful the hotel recommended a trustworthy service to watch my daughter while I was in meetings. Our sitter was fabulous and kept my child on multiple occasions throughout the week. I wish she was local to us, I would definitely book her again! Thank you for peace of mind and excellent service.\n\n~Petry family; (Kennesaw, GA )\n\nEXCELLENT in all areas. We are very pleased with the ease of getting a qualified sitter from the service and pleasantly surprised that she was all the things we asked for \"fit\" and experienced with autism, and knew how to have fun... Giovanna was a wonderful caregiver and a thoughtful person as well. Sent us text of what they were doing around Savannah while we were at our event. Easy-breezy about caring for a challenging child & great attitude.\n\n~Shulenberger Family; (Scottdale, GA)\n\nWas hesitant at first to hire a service, but based on speaking with the service felt better. They arranged the same sitter both nights and all went well. It was great to be able to book last minute and know we had a sitter. I wish this service was in my area for the times we cannot find a sitter.\n\n~Young family; (Purcellville, VA)\n\nTheresa was very good with our 8 month old son.

My three year old daughter loved her sitter Emma so much, she talked about her the whole next day. I was a little nervous at first, never having used a sitting service before. But the entire experience from start to finish was perfect! Everyone I talked to was so nice, and Emma, our sitter, couldn't have been more wonderful!! Thank you!!\n\n~Jackson family; (Marietta GA)\n\nWhat a wonderful service to offer for vacationers who would like an evening out without the kiddos! We were able to have a nice dinner out with other adults while our children were back at the condo rental having a pizza party with the Guardian Angel sitter. They had a great time as well as the adults out to dinner because we knew the kids were in wonderful hands! The sitter put us at ease and seemed extremely confident and took notes before we left for each child. She was a great match for the 4 young children she watched and we came home to a tidy condo!

When I realized the children just wanted to play on the pool water slide I knew my chances of exploring the island and the surrounding areas of Savannah and Charleston were not likely. After a quick search online I found Guardian Angels and the response to my online inquiry was a matter of an hour. Melissa quickly found me a very nice woman to care for four children over the course of the next three days. I couldn't have been more pleased to know they were in good hands and the kitchen was just as I left it upon my return and even the laundry was underway. The sitter gave me her cell phone number and kept me updated throughout the day at my request. I look forward to returning and using Guardian Angels again.\n\n~McCarthy family; (Smithtown, NY )\n\nVery easy booking process. Our sitter was polite and conscientious. Did well with 3 kids 2 and under bless her heart.\n\n~Malone Family; (Holland, Ohio)\n\nI just wanted to say how wonderful Guardian Angels Sitting Service was for us.

We had an excellent experience.\n\n~Ritchie family; (Tampa, FL)\n\nVery good service...thank you for taking care of my pride and joy! Megan was Great !\n\n~Hart family; (Jackson, MS)\n\nWe were in Savannah for a destination wedding with our 18 month old. We had to figure out how to manage going to the wedding and either taking him (which would not be fair on him) or finding a sitter.We do not know anyone in Savannah so we were worried about using a stranger to watch Charlie but the hotel and the wedding planner both recommended Guardian Angels.We got in touch with the service and were happy to see a profile of the selected sitter. She had tons of experience which put us at ease immediately. We changed hotels and days/times for the sitter before we got to Savannah and both were accommodated with no issues. When we met Louise we were happy that she was clearly experienced, polite and energetic enough to keep up with our non-stop toddler. Louise cared for Charlie for 4 nights in a row during our vacation which allowed us to participate in wedding activities. I would highly recommend Guardian Angels, especially Louise, to anyone.\n\n~Mitchell family : (Bermuda)\n\nI used there service on a recent business trip to Savannah.

She arrived promptly to our hotel and was very engaging. I LOVE that she texted me updates through out the evening. I know our little 5 month old, James just adored her. We were so glad to have her a second night. I felt as if I could be away from my baby and know he was in great hands. Hope was also very flexible on our comings and goings which I really appreciated. It can be very difficult when you travel and times of events can change so we were very grateful for her accessibility. Our son had been off on his schedule and she handled it with ease; feeding, changing, dressing and putting him to sleep all in a tiny hotel room where you have to tip-toe around. We will forever be grateful for this weekend!! Thank you for giving us such a wonderful caretaker. We were so very impressed!\n\n~Collins Family; ( Little Rock, Arkansas)\n\nThe staff were friendly and learned children's name which I thought was great.\n\n~ McNeil Family; (Ft Stewart, GA) - Strong Bonds Retreat\n\nI found out about the retreat 3 days before it's date and was cautious about attending due to unsure child care. The event hired sitters and I researched the company and called the area company. My 2 year old cries each time I leave her the whole time I am gone. After talking on the phone, I was relieved the sitters had some smooth tricks to help. And boy did they do a great job when I got there and met them.\n\nThey were all friendly and I could see the love and care they have for children. They were patient and calm and did an absolute GREAT job!\n\n~ Hentzell Family, (Ladson, SC )\n\nWe had a really great experience with Amber.

If we return to Hilton Head, I would def request Amber again.\n\n~ DeSimone family; ( Brooklyn, NY)\n\nGuardian Angels was the perfect babysitting service away from home.

Our daughter was asking to see her again as soon as she left!\n\nDesiree helped us two different days, each time she was prompt in her arrival, and always showed up with a smile, and toys and activities. We highly recommend Guardian Angels, and we will ask For Desiree on our next visit to Bluffton, SC.\n\n~ Lee family\n\nGreat service! Keep up the good work. Thank you.\n\n~ Krawczyk family; (Toronto, ON)\n\nErin and Andrea were amazing. They handled 7 children from 5 different families masterfully, including an 11 month old baby and a set of 5 year-old twins. All of the children were tucked in and asleep when we returned from dinner. It made for a truly relaxing evening. Both Erin and Andrea were extremely responsive in responding to calls and text messages from a couple of anxious parents, quickly putting them at ease. We look forward to using Guardian Angels again on our next trip to Hilton Head!\n\n~ McKnight family; (Atlanta, GA )\n\nWe had an excellent sitter who texted us updates as we were very apprehensive about leaving our baby with an unknown sitter. She was great and Annabelle had a great time.\n\n~ Williams family; (Orlando Fl )\n\nEileen was great. Loved that she had maturity, felt confident she would use good judgment, especially with a child who has severe food allergies and a precocious 3 year old. She also had lots of energy and kept kids entertained out if hotel room. Would highly recommend her. We had never used a service like this before but were attending an out of town wedding and needed a sitter. All aspects of the service, from the booking process to the actual sitting services, were highly professional. We felt confident our children were well cared for and our three kids had fun. Another part of the reason we chose your service is we also travel to Ocean City NJ where I grew up. We will use your service there next time.We highly recommend this service.\n\n~ Vogler family; (Raleigh, NC)\n\nJust another happy note from a very satisfied family. Chelsea was once again prompt, friendly, and the kids loved her.\n\n~ Damsker family\n\nFrom the moment I contacted Guardian Angels I had a good experience. They were very professional and polite handling our reservation and explaining policies. Our sitter DeAndra was awesome. She did crafts with the kids and put them to bed. There was a point when the kids were being loud and she handled it well and got them quiet and engaged. My son and daughter ask about her and we will definitely request her when we are in Savannah as well as use Guardian Angels in the places we visit that they offer service. Thank you for offering us peace of mind and an excellent sitter.\n\n~ The Greens, (Evans, GA)\n\nVery impressed with the service after the last service we had tried to book went MIA.

So pleasant and absolutely wonderful with the kids. They did exactly what we had requested in my prior email and it made for an enjoyable day for both the kids and their parents. I think a few guests would have liked to take them home with them….they were that good! I have expressed to the Virginia Hotel wedding coordinator that your Guardian Angels business is exceptional. I would use your company again if needed and would recommend you to anyone who inquires about sitting services at the shore.\n\nAgain, I am happy that we got to meet in person.

Thanks for setting us up with Theresa - she is great!\n\n~ Marinov family; (Atlanta, GA)\n\nWe were visiting Charleston and Bluffton for our very first time and both of the sitters from Guardian Angels were responsible, courteous and got a big thumbs up in the fun department from my 5 year old daughter! We really appreciated that both sitters brought a lot of activities to play with since we had traveled and not brought along any of those things. Highly recommend this service!!\n\n~ Howell Family; (Sonoma, CA)\n\nWe were very nervous about hiring a babysitter when we were on vacation but the people at Guardian Angel were wonderful and the woman they sent over was exactly what I was looking for in a sitter. The sitter was early to our hotel - very courteous, very engaging and, most importantly, the kids had a great time (and were asleep when we came home). We would definitely use Guardian Angels Sitting service again!\n\n~ Palumbo family; (Potomac, MD)\n\nThe babysitters were punctual and professional. The kids had fun. One sitter got sick and we had another sitter come in her place, which was great. I will use this service again!\n\n~ Kirkpatrick family ; (Johnson City, TN)\n\nThis was our first time using Guardian Angels and the process was so easy and professional.\n\nWe had the same sitter twice, and she took the kids on walks and to the playground. She was wonderful, very friendly and cleaned up after herself and the kids! We would definitely use the service again!\n\nThank you,\n\n~ Fleming family; (Cincinnati, OH)\n\nGreat job! Our kids loved Hayley and Kelsie!\n\nThanks for being so accommodating with our changing schedule!\n\n~ Lewis family; (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nOur daughter is 3 and loved our sitter, Kim! The second night she was begging us to leave so she could play with Kim! Extremely pleased with our sitter, Kim! I had never left my kids, 1 & 3, with a sitter I did not know personally but Kim was great and allowed my husband and I to enjoy dinner dates on our vacation, knowing our kids were well cared for and happy! For me, the key to a service such as this is the high quality sitters that can put nervous parents at ease.\n\n~ Falk family; (Houston, TX)\n\nKim was very professional, polite, and immediately connected with our daughter. She seemed to take the job quite seriously, and we were impressed with her enthusiasm and strong communication skills.\n\n~ Rauscher family; (Lafayette, CO)\n\nClaudie was our \"Angel\" for the night. She was friendly and engaged well with my children. Would definitely use this agency next time we are in the area.\n\n~ Hanson family; (Columbia, SC)\n\nChelsea was great. Timely, fun, and took great care of our 2 year-old daughter, including a wonderful walk on the beach.\n\n~ Vasileff; (Plymouth, MI)\n\nWe had her for 2 nights and they could not wait for her to come back the second night. She brought games and books and related very well to them. Seemed to genuinely enjoy looking after them. I was very comfortable leaving them in her care. Chelsea even was available to have a phone call in advance with my daughter-in-law (who was not on vacation with us) just to make sure she was also comfortable with Chelsea. Very smart, dependable and fun but calm.\n\nChelsea was a perfect match for our 2 granddaughters aged 4 and 6. They were immediately at ease and couldn't wait for her to come back the second night. She was able to feed them dinner and get them to sleep - not an easy feat since they were excited about sharing a room. As a grandmother, it was my first time to ever use a sitting service and was a little apprehensive but the whole process and Chelsea as the sitter worked out better than i expected. Definitely recommend and will use the service and Chelsea if we have the opportunity to again.\n\n~ Herron family, (Stone Mountain, GA)\n\nI just wanted to take a minute to thank you for the service you provide. Our sitter was extremely professional and our son felt so comfortable with Deandra! She is a natural!\n\n~ St Marie Family\n\nOur babysitter was AMAZING and I would highly recommend her. Each night she brought toys and games for the kids to play with (Mae loved her) . She cleaned up the house each night and recapped the night with kids in detail. We were very impressed!\n\n~ Elias family\n\nThe service was easy to find, easy to book and true to it's word. The sitter was punctual and lovely. We miss her and wish we could use her at home. Thank you.\n\n~ Passante family; (Pelham, NY)\n\nDesiree was delightful. She arrived early and asked thorough and thoughtful questions about our son's routine, his likes, dislikes, food and sleeping habits. She brought toys and games to entertain him--even though we certainly had our own.\n\nWhen we returned back to the hotel, she had written a two-page note outlining everything they had done while we were gone, what our son had eaten for dinner, what time he had gone to bed. I would not hesitate to use her again and again and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a sitter while in Hilton Head.\n\n~ COYLE FAMILY; (Portland, OR)\n\nOur girls LOVED the sitter, she was energetic and actually played with them!I would highly recommend this service to anyone visiting HIlton Head. Our sitter was exceptional, we felt very comfortable leaving our little ones in her hands!\n\n~ Murphy family; (Columbus, OH)\n\nOur son had a blast with her, despite just getting over being sick and a long trip down to Hilton Head. He has never had so much fun with someone he just met. She was great! We really appreciated the text she sent us, letting us know that our son was asleep and everything was good. We also liked the letter she wrote, telling us about their night together.The service could not have been better, and we were very happy with our babysitter. Thanks to her, we were able to have a fun and relaxing night, knowing our son was in good hands.\n\n~ Oare family, (Warrenton, VA)\n\nFrom the moment I contacted Guardian Angels I had a good experience. They were very professional and polite handling our reservation and explaining policies. Our sitter DeAndra was awesome. She did crafts with the kids and put them to bed. There was a point when the kids were being loud and she handled it well and got them quiet and engaged. My son and daughter ask about her and we will definitely request her when we are in Savannah as well as use Guardian Angels in the places we visit that they offer service. Thank you for offering us peace of mind and an excellent sitter.\n\n~ The Greens, (Evans, GA)\n\nWe used Guardian Angels for babysitters for 8 different families for a wedding. They were incredibly wonderful to work with - always responsive and accommodating (including when we added two families 4 days before the wedding!). Everyone reported that their sitters were great and the kids had a wonderful time.\n\nI would definitely use them again and would recommend the service.\n\n~ Ganschow family; (Chicago, IL)\n\nSusan was fantastic on Saturday night and came with tons of activities for all the kids. I highly recommend her!\n\n~ Mattix family; ( Virginia)\n\nWe really enjoyed having Mallory take care of our daughter. We felt confident she was in good hands. Thank you Guardian Angels for helping us have a great time!\n\n~ Walker family; (Katy, TX)\n\nSo wonderful and was really great about bringing items for our daughter to keep her entertained. This was our first time using a service and we loved it! The babysitter was very dependable and you could tell loves children and I felt at ease the whole time we were away! Would recommend the service to anyone.\n\n~ Dorsey family; (Arlington, VA)\n\nMy husband and I would like to thank you for your amazing services! Our sitter Erin was amazing!! She was professional and did an amazing job with our son! She was flexible and open to whatever we needed from her to make our wedding week go smoothly! We visit HHI every year and would love for her to watch our son next year again!! Also, planning through guardian angels was so easy and we could not be happier with the services we received from everyone! Thanks again!\n\n~ Josh and Lauren Smith (Greenwell)\n\nThe kids really enjoyed their time with Ms Courtney! They warmed up to her almost immediately, especially since she brought fun toys with her! :) My sister and I felt completely comfortable leaving our 5 young kids (all under 6 years old, including 2 sets of twins!) with her while we enjoyed a nice dinner out with our husbands. I would definitely use this service/sitter again next time we are in Hilton Head, SC.\n\n~Mitchell family; (Midlothian, VA)\n\nThe service is outstanding! Everything was so well orchestrated, from the booking all the way to the service deliverance. It was a relief to have this important detail taken care of by professionals. Our children had a great time. My hat is off to the Guardian Angels\n\n~ Key family; (Aiken, SC )\n\nI found out about the retreat 3 days before it's date and was cautious about attending due to unsure child care. The event hired sitters and I researched the company and called the area company. My 2 year old cries each time I leave her the whole time I am gone. After talking on the phone, I was relieved the sitters had some smooth tricks to help. And boy did they do a great job when I got there and met them.\n\nThey were all friendly and I could see the love and care they have for children. They were patient and calm and did an absolute GREAT job!\n\n~Hentzell Family; (Ladson, SC )\n\nWe loved Courtney! She was prompt, courteous, loving with our 4month old, and she made my husband and me feel very comfortable. We will definitely use Guardian Angels if needed in the future because she was such a great sitter. She is an asset to have on your team!\n\n~Brabham Family ; (Columbia, SC)\n\nVery friendly service. Having a responsible person makes you feel at ease with the care.\n\n~Brite family; (Douglasville, GA)\n\nThe sitter whom we were paired with did a great job babysitting our children during our week long vacation.

The kids loved her and we felt very comfortable the moment we met her. We loved her! She showed up with toys ready to go! The kids had a great time and she put our kind to ease the moment we met her. The service was very professional.\n\n~Corrigan family; (Gahanna, OH)\n\nDesiree was great- very professional, equally at ease with our toddler and our older kids. They had fun, asked if she could come back, and she gave us a very thorough report when we got back.\n\n~Marine family; (Montclair, NJ )\n\nGuardian Angels offered a great and easy to use service when my wife and I were looking for some time alone on our family trip to Hilton Head Island. The sitter was early to allow enough time to be briefed on our children's names, routines and needs for the night. She was professional and well qualified! Thank you for a great service!\n\n~Cox family; (Cincinnati, OH)\n\nI loved the girls taking care of my daughter, she's rarely left with a sitter and these girls put me at ease right away & I knew she was in good hands. I've never felt more at ease with childcare for my daughter!\n\n~Falkner family;( Ellabell, GA)\n\nMy daughters absolutely adored Suzanne. She was caring, thoughtful, and fun. We were pleased that she took initiative - like brought extra snacks on the 2nd day, but asked us whether that was OK. She set appropriate boundaries and the kids not only loved but also respected her.\n\n~Gardner family; (Newton, MA)\n\nThey did a great job with my kids, so good that they didn't want to leave when we came to get them!\n\n~Carlos family; (Ft. Stewart, GA)\n\nFabulous! Ellen was just great. I trusted her completely. She was a very kind and sweet person. Everything went off without a hitch. She watched our little Maltese, Annabelle, while we celebrated my granddaughter's wedding in Savannah. Ellen watched Annabelle every evening for 4 nights--from 4:00 p.m. until between 11:00 and midnight. These people know what they are doing and you can trust them!\n\n~Hogendorn family; (Solon, IA)\n\nDeandra was very polite. She listened to directions. We arrived home and she updated us on the evening - children remained asleep. She checked on them periodically.\n\n~Berkowitz family;\n\nShe was not only polite and courteous but very personable, friendly and caring. Came with books and toys. Great sitter. Personable, caring, friendly. I would definitely use her again and would also recommend Guardian Angels to my friends.\n\n~Strassner family; (Sandy Springs, GA)\n\nWe - and our children - could not have been more thrilled with our experience with Guardian Angels and Telicia. Thank you so much!\n\n~Fox family; (Mill Valley, CA )\n\nVery gracious and kind. I could not have been more pleased with everything!\n\n~Jones family; (Charlotte, NC)\n\nI will def use this service as a private customer. My son enjoyed his sitter who played with him and kept him calm while I was in sessions.\n\n~Meharg family, (Fort Stewart, GA)\n\nMy daughter was very upset with the idea of a stranger watching her. By the time I returned to pick her up she was happy and informed me about the crafts she did and the food she ate.\n\n~Page family; (Aiken, SC )\n\nWe were so happy with Desiree. My son had such a good time with her. My son has special needs and he warmed up to her immediately. He had a blast hanging out with her. We could not have been more pleased!\n\n~Linton family ; (Potomac Falls, VA)\n\nGreat Service. Very Pleased\n\n~Bush family ; (Hoover, AL)\n\nWe loved our sitter.

Very friendly and easy to use. My children loved their sitter and she even brought fun things for my kids to do and make. Would recommend and will definitely use again.\n\n~Pease family; (Columbus, GA)\n\nSamantha was better than we could have ever anticipated. She truly cared for our grandson, had activities for him, played games with him, and became a friend for him. He could not wait for her to come back the second day. Very prompt and courteous. She was exactly what we hoped for and more.\n\n~Dallman family ; (Bradenton, FL)\n\nI can't say enough good things about the experience and our sitter. She was better than i could have ever expected. I was certainly nervous about using a sitting service and a sitter that we'd never met before but it was just a perfect experience. There were a number of issues with my work dinner and our sitter was so unbelieveably gracious and professional. Ms Susan was thoughtful, considerate, and - most of all - GREAT with the kids. They asked if she could come back the next day.\n\nWell prepared, professional, kind and courteous - couldn't have been a better experience!!\n\n~Massie family; (Smyrna, GA)\n\nOur sitter came for 2 days. She arrived on time and was very interactive with our special needs daughter. She took her out for rides, to the mall, etc., and also took her for long walks. We so appreciate this service!\n\n~Tollison family; (Greenville, SC)\n\nMeghan was punctual, polite, and had fun with my kids. Even though she only babysat in the evening and had very little interaction with them before bed, you can tell that she loves children. She made an effort to get to know my toddler in the little time we had together. All you can hope for is that someone has good judgement should an emergency happen, and we felt confident that she does.\n\n~Heimowitz family; (NY, NY )\n\nNatalie was FANTASTIC! She brought toys for our son and took him to the playground. He didn't even notice we were missing, he has a great time with her. She even sent us a pic of him when he fell asleep to put our minds at ease. We just loved her and Thank you!\n\n~Miller family; (Media PA )\n\nWonderful experience and will definitely be using you guys again!\n\n~Clair family; (Durango, CO )\n\nThe process to book our sitter was simple and quick!

Advance communication fantastic, timely, uniformed, professional, and equipped to keep our two girls entertained. A+++\n\n~Melia family; (Falls Church, VA)\n\nChequaila was the best person to care for my mother. My mother does not know her limitations. Chequaila not only watched my mother safety but did in a manner that my mother never noticed. I would recommend Chequaila to anyone who has a elderly person who has a tough disposition. She not only took care of my mother but made her feel like she was making the decision for herself. Thank You for having such a wonderful person on your staff.\n\n~Starsiak family; (Spring Grove, IL)\n\nGreat service....easy to book and confident in the service.\n\n~Gilbow family; (Indianola, MS)\n\nI have never left my son with anyone other than a family member and even then for only very short periods of time but when my son asked for Kim to come over again on Saturday after he had spent the night before with her, I knew I made the right choice.\n\n~McKenna family; (Browns Summit, NC)\n\nRadie was a great sitter and we felt comfortable with her from the time she arrived.\n\n~Ray Family, (Tupelo, MS)\n\nGuardian Angels was wonderful!

Thanks so much for the peace of mind while we were on vacation!\n\n~Gatson family; (Chevy Chase, MD)\n\nWe were in Charleston for a wedding. I called Melissa a few days before our arrival and she worked quickly to find us a great sitter for the days we needed. She was courteous and very responsive. We are very grateful!\n\nWe could not have been happier with the service that was provided. We travel a lot and have used similar services in different cities. Guardian Angels is on the top. We are back in Austin now and he has asked on a few occasions when is he going to get to play with LeAnn again. She was so sweet! We could not have been happier. Wish she lived closer to us so we could use her again!\n\n~Barzizza family; (Austin, TX)\n\nOur twin two year olds and six year old loved our sitter, Haley. She was very confident and comfortable around the children. We have used sitters all over the country and this one was one of the best we've had. She even had drawing supplies with her! Thank you for allowing my hubby and I to get out and enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids.\n\n~ Marvin Family, (Atlanta, GA)\n\nThank you so much for sending Hayley to us during our recent visit to Palmetto Bluff, SC. She was absolutely wonderful, and a pleasure to have sit for our six kids. We had a very unstructured evening, and Hayley easily adapted to our changing needs. My only regret is that she doesn't live in our home state!\n\n~Heather Negley; (Scotch Plains, NJ)\n\nOur son was married last weekend in Charleston and we used Guardian Angels Sitting Services three times. Amy is a competent and caring \"sitter\" and we felt very comfortable knowing that our granddaughter was in such good hands. We highly recommend your services. Thank you.\"\n\n~Bortnick family; (Potomac, MD )\n\nWe loved Susan. She was loving, fun and knowledgable with our 4 year old and so loving and caring towards our 4 month old.

We will always request her when we come down south!\n\n~Brister family; (Cottontown, TN )\n\nThank you so much for finding Victoria for us for pet sitting. She was awesome and our dog loved her, too. I would use her services again!\n\n~Doyle family; (Chicago, IL)\n\nKim was fantastic, and I hope to be able to use her next time we visit Charleston! Thank you for all of your help with making my vacation much better and allowing me to rest easy, knowing my little guy was in good hands.\n\n~Ward family;( Brooklyn, NY)\n\nThe service was very professional. Took care of a meeting with the assigned sitter before the job so the 2 year old would be comfortable. On time (4:45 am) and ready so we could make our start of the race. My daughter had never hired a babysitter for her 6 month old son or her 2 year old daughter. She was very concerned about leaving them. After meeting Susan her mind was put to ease and she was able to run the Race knowing her children were in good hands.\n\n~Stoneking family ; (Minneapolis, MN)\n\nI had a wonderful trip & felt very confident about Samantha's care for my kitty. She called me on the last day to let me know that all was well here. She left a receipt for the payments I made & the house & cat were in good shape when I get home. I hope I can call on you all again.\n\n~Lewis family; Sun City\n\nI have used Guardian Angles for years.\n\nI am always been impressed with Christina's professionalism and focus on the quality of her babysitters.

I will definitely use their service next summer!\n\n~Clark family; (Rockville, MD)\n\nDeAndra was amazing!! In five years, it was the only time my children have not cried when we left!!\n\nBalenger family; (Hendersonville, NC)\n\nJust the best!!! I was very cautious to use a sitting service but all of our concerns went out the door as soon as we met with the agency. We have used several times & all the girls were wonderful. My son had a great time with all the sitters. Everyone was very polite & provided a great level of service. I strongly recommend to all of my friends, family & refer often. Thank you,\n\n~Kieran family; (Cold Spring, NJ)\n\nOur sitter was on time and very patient with our little, who had not spent much time away from parents before her sitting session with him.\n\n~Gencheva family; (Laurel, DE)\n\nAbsolutely wonderful service! Our sitter was extraordinary and all 3 children felt comfortable with her. She met each of their needs...ages 12,9,and 4. She did special activities with them. They really liked her and so did we!\n\n~Jackie M., (Cherry Hill, New Jersey)\n\nI wanted to thank you for coordinating a sitter for us. Christa was an absolute delight. She was prompt, professional and so great with the kids. It was very hectic at the hotel with the wedding going on and the hotel room was smaller than I had anticipated. Christa rolled with it and we so appreciated it. Her experience with similar events and situations made us very comfortable and we really appreciated her flexibility to be with the children in a small space and bring them downstairs a few times to enjoy the wedding a bit too. We highly recommend Christa to your other client families.\n\nI was nervous to find a sitter online and through a service but we have had a great experience and we will recommend Guardian Angels to friends and family in the area.\n\nRegards,\n\n~Stefani Crumley\n\nSamantha was a terrific. I would recommend her in a heartbeat. Samantha took my boys to the skate park where they had a wonderful time. She also gave them to eat for lunch, and when I came home they were playing games. My boy said that she was great fun. I would recommend Guardian angel sitting service any day of the week. It was fast easy, and you can trust the sitters.\n\n~Chappell family; (Hilton Head, SC )\n\nThe sitters were hired to help entertain the children at my daughter's wedding reception. They were amazing! The knew just when to step in and distract them, and when to back off. They were very professional and did a fantastic job! I highly recommend Guardian Angels and these three sitters.\n\n~Valentine family; (Myrtle Beach, SC)\n\nAmber was great. My six month old son immediately bonded with her and we got comfortable quickly. She was very sweet with him, knew what she was doing, and she was easy company to have around. We were very hesitant about using a service particularly since our son is so young, but it was a very positive experience. It really helped us enjoy our vacation.\n\n~Bernard family; ( Brooklyn, NY)\n\n\"Just a note to thank you for the babysitting service your company provided. My Niece said that the babysitter was wonderful and that everything went well. You were prompt and very well organized which I could not say about me. Having a wedding in Cape May can be a wonderful thing but it certainly is a lot of work. Hopefully we can return and really vacation there and come enjoy a breakfast at your family's restaurant.\"\n\n~ Sue\n\n\"Like always, I was hesitant to leave my kids with someone other then my family but when work called Guardian Angels stepped up to the plate. I worked on conference calls in my office as a Guardian Angel watched over my own angels. I finally had piece of mind and piece of quite to get what needed to be done finished. I am so happy that a mommy friendly babysitting service is available in Cape May County. The babysitter painted and did a craft with my kids and ran outside with them. I occasionally heard a giggle from outside the office and that was reaffirming that my children were in good hands (ahem.....wings?)\"\n\n~ Elizabeth Norton (Cape May, NJ)\n\nThis was the first time I ever left my 8-month-old son with anyone other then my Mother. I felt very comfortable right away with our babysitter, Elizabeth. My son was smiling right away. She was excellent. I do plan on using Guardian Angels sitting service again in the future. Thank you for a wonderful experience.\n\n~ Jennifer Martin (Lakewood, NJ)\n\nWhile away from home we utilized the Guardian Angels Sitting Service at a hotel and immediately got a comforting feeling from the friendly scheduling exchange down to the detail in learning more about the baby sitter in advance. The service and babysitter on site were professional and friendly and asked all the right questions before we left. We would use the service again next time we’re visiting the Jersey shore.\n\n~ Lyza Lyon (Maplewood, NJ)\n\nThank you for your help in finding the perfect babysitter for our 14 month old little girl. The babysitter was not only friendly and sweet but also obviously knowledgeable about kids. We felt very comfortable going out knowing she was there. I would easily recommend your services to my friends and family. Thanks again for your professional yet personal service. We will call you next time we are in Cape May! Cheers!\n\n~ Colleen Fleming (New York, NY)\n\nOur weekend at an Atlantic City hotel for my company's holiday party was the first time we'd ever left our son with a babysitter. We had some specific requirements to meet his needs, and you came through with flying colors! We are so appreciative of your outstanding service. When asked to rate his sitter on a scale from 1 to 5, 5 being the highest, our son rated her 3,000,005! Thank you so much!\n\n~ Murray Apatoff (Langhorne, PA)\n\nThanks for everything. Jessica is a gem. Zachy loved her, and we felt completely secure with her. She is cute, lively, fun and attentive, and we will look forward to working with her again, next time we are in the A.C. area. If she ever needs a reference, let us know – we really enjoyed having her babysit for Zachy, and he just bonded with her as if he had known her for ages.\n\n~ Jonathan Zanger (New York City, NY)\n\nIt was a pleasure working with Guardian Angels. I almost decided to not make the trip because we did not have a babysitter for my daughter. I've never left her alone with anyone besides her Grandmother so I was very nervous and a bit stressed out. To complicate matters, my daughter is very leery of strangers. After a whole year, she still cries every morning when we drop her off to daycare! I am happy to report your sitter arrived on time, was dressed appropriately and had a wonderful demeanor. We were gone for 4 hours and not a single tear! Wow! It couldn't have worked out any better than it did. Thanks for coming to my family's rescue! Because of you, we were able to conduct our presentations while the babysitter was there and have time for a wonderful mini family vacation at the beach following. Thanks!\n\n~Diane Ellis (Waxhaw, North Carolina)\n\nWe had an absolutely wonderful time with your service. Heidi was fabulous and just great with our daughter. We will be back in July and I will contact you in advance to see if Heidi can return. We also liked Lindsay, too. Thank you so much for opening Guardian Angels to give visiting families a great option to help take care of our kids! My sister-in-law and cousin will both be down with kids later this summer and we will recommend you highly.\n\n~Page Kranbuhl (Washington DC)\n\nI needed a sitter last minute on a holiday weekend and the representative from Guardian Angels Sitting went above and beyond trying to accommodate us. She was very attentive and courteously fielded numerous calls. We were very happy with the babysitting services that we received. Our sitter kept in contact with us when she ran into heavy traffic (July 4th weekend) and we felt very comfortable leaving her with our son. I will definitely use this service again when I return to Atlantic City. Thanks again!\n\n~Jennifer Griffing (Frederick, MD)\n\n\"Guardian angels have been very professional, quick & efficient. They find somebody trustful who immediately took excellent care of our 3 kids. I definitely recommend using Guardian Angels Services.\" sego, mum of 6 yo, 2.5 yo and 1.5 yo.\n\n~Ségolène de Marolles (Atlanta, GA-monthly member)\n\nWe had a very positive experience with our sitters from Guardian Angels Sitting Service. Both were highly qualified and engaging with our daughter. She adored both of them and liked having special things while we had an adult evening. We felt 110% comfortable with both matches and appreciated the time Christina took to place just the right sitter with our toddler. Guardian Angels Sitting Service met and exceeded our very high expectations! We look forward to using them again next month when we return. A+++\n\nKind regards,\n\n~Laura Hughs (Arlington, VA)\n\nWe are so very pleased with your service and the sitter you provided us. Heidi was absolutely amazing!!! Our daughter took to her right away (which is saying a lot!!). She was so good with her.....playing with her, reading her books, taking her to the beach, the pool and the library. Heidi was very punctual and accommodating.... and even agreed to stay late when our job ran over. I highly recommend her to everyone!!! Thank you!!\n\n~Janine M. Bartok (Eagle, CO – Weekly member)\n\nThank you so much. Christa was wonderful. Your service allowed my wife and I to escape for an afternoon boat ride which we have a hard time doing since we had twins 6 months ago. We will be using your service again soon.\n\n~Mark Gellert (Royersford, PA)\n\nThanks again Christina. Laura was great, and if you could let her know, Keegan's first words in the morning were, \"Where is she? I want to see her!\" Take care, and we'll be in touch if we're ever in your neck of the woods again.\n\n~Bridget Evans (Alexandria, VA)\n\nOur pet sitter was wonderful and so friendly! It was a relief to know that our dogs were being so well cared for!\n\n~Greg Lis (Virginia)\n\nYour service was a lifesaver to my wife and me. Andrea was on time both nights and seemed to really enjoy our sons company allowing us to enjoy ourselves without worrying about our boy. We were so grateful to have your company available, which in turn, made our vacation much more relaxed and enjoyable.\n\nThanks.\n\n~Sam Pittenger (Knoxville, TN)\n\nWe really enjoyed having Delia sit. Carl (my five year old) announced, \"Delia is fun\"! When Elizabeth (my almost 3 year old) woke up the next day, she asked, \"Where is Delia. She come back soon?\" As the mom, I was really delighted with Delia's professional demeanor and obvious comfort level with the kids.\n\nThanks!\n\n~Katherine Widnell (Wichita, KS)\n\n\"Melissa, we wanted to let you know how happy we were with Mandy sitting for us and taking care of our 5 1/2 a 2 year old girls. After meeting her, my wife and I were comfortable enough to have a relaxing and enjoyable evening out without worrying. The girls loved Mandy and we loved the art projects we got when we got home!! Thanks again, and we will be calling you again next time in Hilton Head\n\n~Larry R. Brooks, (Roswell, GA)\n\nMelissa,\n\nWe just wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed your service and Tiffany as our sitter. We will definitely contact you the next time we need a sitter. Tiffany was a wonderful sitter and handled all of our details with care and professionalism.\n\nThanks so much for Tiffany.\n\nRegards,\n\n~Fred and Irene Klein (Hardeeville, SC)\n\nI highly recommend this sitting service.\n\nWe went on a 4th of July vacation to Cape May, and wanted to have one romantic night as a couple, but nervous to leave our 3 kids with a stranger... Christina was very reassuring on phone and emails, and the sitter was a lovely experienced college girl.\n\nWe're going again next summer, and plan to use Guardian Angels again!\n\n~The Ponzio Family (Tenafly, NJ)\n\nWe used the sitting service while visiting Cape May. Our sitter was wonderful and the kids loved her. She took them out on the town, while we enjoyed a nice dinner and some shopping. I felt completely secure and confident with the sitter and we are already planning on using the agency again during our next vacation.\n\n~Laura Johnson (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nI was at a work conference in Savannah, GA and the hotel recommended Guardian Angels service. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Teresa, the angel send to watch my angel. She was wonderful with my 7-mo. old son. He was entertained and happy, did I mention asleep 1 hour before his normal bedtime! She was trustworthy and clearly very good with children. I do not trust easily, so this was very difficult for me. She and Guardian Angels were fantastic and I will recommend them to anyone I know!\n\n~Danielle Hardin, (Avon, IN)\n\nThank you so much for referring Shannon to us. She was absolutely wonderful and the kids loved her! She arrived on time, was professional, friendly and trustworthy. I will definitely be calling again and asking for Shannon! Regards,\n\n~Andrea Scalisi (Merrick, NY)\n\nGuardian Angels has always provided my polite, friendly, competent sitters that I felt immediately comfortable leaving my child with. Their ability to get me a sitter on short notice has been a saving grace. My child had reoccurring ear infections before she got tubes and was getting sent home from daycare regularly with fevers. If it hadn't been for the ability to contact Guardian Angels and get a sitter at the last minute for the following day I don't know how we would've made it through. The service and the people are wonderful. I recommend them highly.\n\n~Christine Wrobel (Bluffton, SC)\n\nMelissa,\n\nI wanted to follow up with you from the other night. I came home and was in absolute shock. Amanda had basically cleaned my whole house. Prior to going out I told her to excuse the house, especially the kids messy rooms because I worked and went to college full time. She took it upon herself to clean the kids rooms and even vacuumed them. She cleaned the dishes and emptied the dishwasher. This was one of the best surprises that I had ever had. When someone comes to watch the kids, I don't expect them to clean up after my mess. In fact, I usually come home to a bigger mess than when I left. Amanda went above and beyond. I can not tell you how happy I was upon returning. Of course the kids like her a great deal, which is why I requested her, but I did not expect this. I cannot say enough great things about Amanda, or about the ease of using your service. It is so nice to know that a sitter can be available on short notice. It is especially nice to know that you are insured and that your sitters can be trusted. Calvin and I had a sitter steal money and jewelry from us a while back, and we are very leery of who whe leave with the kids. Thank you again so very much. I will gladly do a ton of free marketing for you. You have a great service. Thanks again,\n\n~ Kristen (Hilton Head Island, SC )\n\nI would recommend this service to friends/family visiting the area that do not have a regular babysitter. However, the price for this service limits my ability to use them in the future. Had I not used my gift certificate, I do not think I would have used their services. I was very pleased with the contact I had with Guardian Angel and the ability to find a sitter for my children. Our sitter was also very friendly and my kids had a great time.\n\nWe were very pleased with Guardian Angels Sitting Service. Everyone was polite and helpful. Our sitter was great with our children. I would recommend their service to anyone visiting the area.\n\n~Stacey Crockett (Bluffton, SC)\n\nThe sitter was friendly and caring. My son loved spending time with her. They played games, did activities and swam in the pool while I was a way.\n\nShe was also punctual and reliable. I was not worried leaving my son with her as she took very good care of him. ~Rohan Jayasena, (Sidney, NY )\n\nWe had Theresa Lynn from Savannah, GA. This was our first time having a babysitter outside of the family, so we were very nervous. Theresa was very comforting and made me feel secure leaving our 4 month old with her. I wish you had a service in Northern NJ where we are from. Thanks again!\n\n~ Cianesi Pena, (West Orange, NJ )\n\nWe were able to go out on the town with a peace of mind knowing that our daughter was being well looked after by a professional sitter from Guardian Angels.\n\n~Nelson Whitford, (Newmarket, ON )\n\nGreat job by a group of professionals who not only do a great job, but do a job they love and do it professionally.\n\n~Brett Newmeyer , (Columbia, SC )\n\nProfessional and exactly what we needed for our special guest! Great service!\n\n~Jenny King, SCAD University Savannah, GA\n\nWe absolutely adored our sitter. Natalie was wonderful with our 8 month old and 2 year old. It was so great having her with us for the week. We will definitely be asking for her again for our next trip to HHI.\n\n~Amanda Keller, (Alliance , OH)\n\nThe best keep secret at the shore!\n\n~Karen Mandler, (Stone Harbor, NJ )\n\nEnjoyed a night away from my kiddos while on vacation! My kids had fun too!\n\n~Kit McCaffrey, (Sevierville, TN)\n\nWe recently lost a long time sitter and had been left with some gaps in our childcare coverage for the summer. One quick email and all my needs have been met. The boys are all smiles so far, and have been anxiously awaiting their \"new babysitter\" to return. Thank you!\n\n~Roseanne Foxx, (Avalon, NJ )\n\nSarah, our sitter, cleaned our condo better than I would have ever dreamed myself doing. She placed our beach things up on hangers, washed the children's clothes and our beach bags, emptied the dishwasher and straightened the condo. She was great.\n\n~Liesel French, (Birmingham, AL)\n\nGreat service, made our vacation relaxing and provided a nice break for us.\n\n~Darby Mingey, (Brooklyn, NY)\n\nI was concerned about finding the perfect sitter for my nephews' children during my daughter's wedding ceremony at the Seaview Dolce Resort. Since my nephews were coming in from Tennessee, I was especially concerned about the adaptation of the four boys, aged 4,5,6, &7, to being in a strange place with someone they had never met. My concerns were totally unfounded. Almost from the start, the sitter had the children playing games and even \"braiding her hair\". The parents only checked on them once and were completely at ease. Thank you for providing a service that allowed everyone to enjoy our wonderful wedding celebration.\n\n~Frances Purciello, (Barnegat, NJ )\n\nI was very pleased with Guardian Angels and Eliza K. We had a last minute request for a wedding weekend in Savannah and Guardian Angels took care of us promptly and professionally. As a mom in a new city, I was pretty uneasy leaving my son with a stranger. But Eliza was wonderful, politely took control upon arrival, and allowed us to proceed on to the wedding events. She followed all instructions we had for care and gave a full report at the end of each day. We will definitely try to use Guardian Angels in the future if available where we are traveling.\n\n~Kara Miller, (Round Rock, TX )\n\nIt was a little more expensive than we pay at home, but given the short notice, set up time and the environment, we didn't feel the cost was unreasonable. Melisa was very accommodating, and the kids loved both sitters. We felt very comfortable with the whole process, especially comfortable leaving the kids with the sitter.\n\n~Dennis Patrick (Mt Pleasant, SC )\n\nWe were pleased with the ease of requesting a sitter. She was lovely and my children really liked her!\n\n~Shane Fryer, (West Haven , CT)\n\nThank you and Megan for such great service last weekend in Atlantic City. We were so happy with the service and Megan was just a delight. My daughter has asked already if we can go back to Atlantic City, and we go to a party so she can have Megan babysit again. Thanks so much and we have already recommended your service and will do so on Yelp as well.\n\n~ Jacqueline Sloboda\n\nWe had wonderful sitters for our trip to Savannah. Would highly recommend them...\n\n~ Megan Palmeri, (Augusta, GA)\n\nExecellent service, thank you!\n\n~ Robert Bagay, (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nWe love the sitters at Guardian Angels. We use the service every time we are on Hilton Head Island and that is several times a year. The sitters are always on time, nice, and bring things to entertain our girls. I would recommend guardian angels to any one and tell them to enjoy their time because they will not have to worry about their children!\n\n~ Larry Brooks, (Roswell, GA)\n\nThis was a brand new experience for us, to use a sitting service in a visiting city. We were impressed by the professional responses received during our initial inquiry, the detailed information emailed in advance about our sitter and then we were mostly impressed by the young lady who took excellent care of our four year old daughter who even asked when she could be babysat by her again.\n\n~Laura Risman- Lipkin, (Staten Island, NY)\n\nGuardian Angels did an excellen"
