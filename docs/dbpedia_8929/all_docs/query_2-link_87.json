        "text": "For the second year in a row, Heritage Vineyards in Harrison Township has been chosen to host the Jersey Fresh Food and Wine Festival this Saturday and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nLast year there were 24 wineries at the festival which drew 4,000 visitors. This year, 26 state wineries and 6,000 guests are expected to gather at the Gloucester County winery.\n\nSponsored by the Garden State Wine Growers Association, an organization that represents wineries in New Jersey, this festival is one of four or five big events held every year, said Rich Heritage of Heritage Vineyards.\n\n“This is their largest festival ... we were chosen because there’s a big movement right now to produce quality wines,” Heritage said. “We are moving out of the sweet wines and moving more toward dry wines in New Jersey. And our winery is the model for that movement.”\n\nThe 125 acres of land the vineyard owns was another good reason to have the festival there, Heritage said.\n\nFive acres of the land — mostly apple and peach orchards left over from pre-vineyard days — had to be cleared to provide a parking lot for guests, Heritage said.\n\n“We are able to accommodate a large group of people,” he said.\n\nThe winery, which got its start in 2001, began making wines from 10 acres of land. Today, the winery produces several varieties of wines from nearly 30 acres of vineyards.\n\n“It’s just becoming so popular. It really just went viral for us,” Heritage said.\n\nThe vineyard recently won several awards for their wines. They received three gold medals for their 2007 Chambourcin, 2007 Cabernet Franc and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. They also won a silver for their 2007 Merlot and three bronze medals for their non-vintage Blueberry Wine, a 2007 Syrah and a 2007 Dry Rosé.\n\nThe festival gives guests a chance to taste these award-winning wines, Heritage said. Festival-goers can sample more than 250 types of wines from the 26 wineries.\n\n“They are given a glass and can walk around the field tasting wines,” he said.\n\nThere will also be live music at the event. Singer-songwriter Eryn Shewell will perform on Saturday and the band Swampadelica will bring Caribbean sounds to the festival on Sunday. There will also be crafts for sale at the event and food from the Swedes Inn and the Barnsboro Inn will be available for guests to enjoy.\n\nOther local wineries offering vintages to try include Auburn Road Vineyards of Pilesgrove, Bellview Winery of Landisville, Cedarvale Winery of Logan Township, Chestnut Run Farm from Pilesgrove, Coda Rossa of Franklinville, DiBella Winery LLC of Woolwich Township, Swansea Vineyards of Shiloh and the Wagonhouse Winery of Harrison Township.\n\nIf you go:\n\nThe Jersey Fresh Food and Wine Festival comes to Heritage Vineyards, 480 Mullica Hill Road, Mullica Hill on Saturday and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. on both days. Entry price is $20 per person. Discount tickets can be purchased for $18 per person (must be 21 years old) at\n\n."
