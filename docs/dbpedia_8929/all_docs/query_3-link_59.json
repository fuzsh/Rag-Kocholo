        "text": "When there's music in the air in Jacksonville Beach, with big, laid-back crowds gathering to listen, chances are pretty good that Sam Veal has something to do with it.\n\nVeal's signature event, Springing the Blues, gets cranking Friday afternoon at the SeaWalk Pavilion, and continues until the sun goes down on Sunday.\n\nIf things go as usual, a total of about 150,000 people will show up for the festival over three days, said Veal, the festival's founder and director.\n\nThis is the 26th anniversary for Springing the Blues, which began as a one-day event and drew an audience of about 3,000 its first year.\n\nThe figure was quite humble compared to current averages, but it was large enough to convince Veal he had a good thing going.\n\n\"I planned for it to be a destination event,\" he said. \"I knew that whoever came and heard the music would be transformed. And they would come back.\"\n\nAnd they have. Veal has heard accounts of festival fans who annually travel from as far away as California to attend the festival, a celebration of an American-born style of music.\n\nSome people have the mistaken belief that blues music is bleak and depressing, he said. But there's a soulful energy and vibe to the blues that \"will put a smile on your face.\"\n\nJacksonville Beach needed something to smile about when Veal, now 63, started kicking around the idea of a music festival back in 1989. The downtown area was stagnant, with no big music events - like Jacksonville's jazz festival - to attract a sizable crowd.\n\n\"I had a lifelong friend, Reid McCormick, who was considering running for mayor of Jacksonville Beach,\" Veal said. \"We were talking. I said, 'You need to run for mayor, and we need a destination event for Jacksonville Beach that would be for everybody.'\"\n\nMcCormick took his friend's advice. After McCormick got elected, Veal began shopping around the idea of a blues fest.\n\nHe had been to the annual King Biscuit Blues Festival in Helena, Ark., and experienced \"a great vibe.\" He believed the same feeling could be duplicated here.\n\nVeal believed the blues could provide a bond between all different groups of people. \"The idea is that music transcends racial divides, any potential separations from each other,\" he said.\n\nThere weren't a lot of big names associated with the blues - \"You could basically count them on one hand,\" Veal said - so the festival could focus on \"up-and-coming performers who could end up being the next big thing.\"\n\nThat part seemed logical and easy. What he struggled with, however, was a name for the festival. Then early one morning he woke up and it came to him: Springing the Blues.\n\n\"It was lively, it was active,\" Veal said, \"and after that, it all started falling into place.\"\n\nARTISTIC BUSINESSMAN\n\nVeal was born in Jacksonville and grew up in Ponte Vedra Beach. His professional background doesn't provide a quick, rational connection to a music festival celebrating the blues.\n\nIn his late teens, he studied ballet (after developing a serious crush on the daughter of the owner of a local ballet school). He continued to study dance at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you,\" said the outgoing, good-natured Veal. \"I loved the idea of dancing with girls.\"\n\nHe went on to dance professionally for about six years. He danced with the American Ballet Theatre in New York, then Iranian National Ballet Company in Tehran, followed by the Theatre du Silence in Paris, and finally the Bat-Dor Dance Co. in Tel Aviv.\n\nAnd when Veal returned to Ponte Vedra Beach in 1981, he started an insurance company, which he still operates today.\n\n\"I was schizophrenic,\" he joked. \"I had an artistic side, and a business side.\"\n\nHere's the link to blues music, which originated in African-American communities in the Deep South around the end of the 19th century.\n\n\"My early baptism into that form of music was through a woman who helped raise me,\" Veal said. \"She sang old Negro spirituals. There was a soulfulness to the music she sang.\n\n\"That was the seed, along with the fact that my parents had a great love for a broad range of music, including the blues.\"\n\nWhile living overseas, he found access to the blues easy through a number of accomplished American expatriate blues players in Europe.\n\nCOMMITTED TO THE COAST\n\nWhen Veal was generating support for Springing the Blues, a Jacksonville Beach city councilman asked him to promise to keep the festival at the Beaches. His motivation: The jazz festival, which got its start in Mayport, moved to Metropolitan Park in downtown Jacksonville as it grew in popularity.\n\nVeal has happily kept that promise. And over the years, he's worked to bring additional festivals to the Beaches as well.\n\nHe co-founded the Hispanic-themed Fiesta de Playera, which took place at the end of Atlantic in Jacksonville Beach every June for 10 years.\n\nAs director of sponsorship and marketing for Jax Beach Festivals - an umbrella organization that includes Springing the Blues - he is also a force behind the Seawalk Music Festival (in February), the Great Atlantic Music Fest (in March), and the Salt Life Festival (in June).\n\nSpringing the Blues raises money for various charitable groups, and for more than 20 years, has supported the Blues in the Schools program, which teaches area students about the blues.\n\nBut the festival hasn't lost sight of its primary purpose, Veal said, which was in place from the beginning.\n\n\"The biggest goal is to bring the community together,\" he said.\n\nDavid Crumpler: (904) 359-4164\n\nSpringing the Blues\n\nSeaWalk Pavilion, Jacksonville Beach\n\nThe festival is free, but VIP tickets can be purchased.
