        "text": "Shewell History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Shewell name has descended through the generations from the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture. Their name comes from having lived in any of the places named Sewell, Showell, Seawell, and Sywell in England. Shewell is a local surname, which belongs to the category of hereditary surnames. There are a variety of types of local surnames, some of which include: topographic surnames, which could be given to a person who lived beside any physical feature, such as a hill, stream, church or type of tree. Habitation names form the other broad category of surnames that were derived from place-names. They were derived from pre-existing names for towns, villages, parishes, or farmsteads. Other local names are derived from the names of houses, manors, estates, regions, and entire counties. It is also possible that the surname Shewell is a patronymic surname, which derives from the Old English given name Siwal(d). This surname is composed of the elements sige, s√¶ and weard, which mean victory, sea, and rule, respectively.\n\nEarly Origins of the Shewell family\n\nThe surname Shewell was first found in Warwickshire where the earliest record of the name was Sewallis, a \"noble Saxon\" who possessed Lower Eatington before the Norman Conquest.
