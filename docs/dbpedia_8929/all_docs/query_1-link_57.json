Her effervescent personality radiated care and warmth in her teaching style and interactions with the students. She was and remains a popular figure amongst staff and students on the Acting Studies Programme. I could rely on Anna to deliver a class that would technically exceed expectations and ensure that the teaching was of the highest possible standard.\n\nDuring her two years with us, Anna's interdisciplinary approach brought a freshness to the vocal training that transformed the student's relationship with musicality and their voices. Her physiovocal approach supported the students to understand more deeply the connection between movement, voice and acting without compromising on vocal technique.\n\nI was often inspired by Anna’s engagement with research that ensured she had the latest developments in her field at her fingertips. This gave her teaching a continuous relevance and an impressive balance of enquiry and expertise.\n\nAnna was always extremely professional and considerate in her interactions with both staff and students at the school. I shared so many broad, stimulating and thrilling conversations with Anna, ranging from topics such as inclusivity in voice, gender, pedagogy, theatre making, musicality, rhythm, breath and text. She was a constant source of intellectual nourishment and ideas surrounding her field.\n\nWe worked closely developing the vocal offer for the students. Anna’s methodology allowed her to remain agile and tune in to the students' specific needs. The work was challenging and demanding on the group, bringing a vital alertness and clarity to their listening, and thereby deepening their attention and concentration in their work. Her feedback was always clear, concise and communicated Anna’s ensemble practice allowed for a togetherness without losing the importance of individual and personal development\"\n\nProgramme Leader, BA Hons in Acting Studies, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, March 2023\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE"
