        "text": "Blues and roots players turn out for Light of Day\n\nBetween the Light of Day Winterfest marathon of shows going on in Asbury Park this weekend and a few other choice events, blues, jazz and roots-rock fans will find something to satisfy their own particular tastes. Take a look:\n\nTonight at 8 p.m. at Open Arts Stage Theater, 146 Route 130 South in Bordentown, two of New Jersey's most seasoned bands take the stage in a show orchestrated by Randy Now, who helped to put City Gardens nightclub, the Record Collector store and the New Hope Winery on the map. The 1910 Fruitgum Company will perform tonight on a bill with the Doughboys.\n\nThe Doughboys, led by a dynamic frontman, Myke Scavone of Long Branch, includes original bassist Mike Caruso and drummer Richard X. Heyman. Gar Francis, guitar and vocals, and a veteran nightclub musician, is the relative newcomer in the group, having been with them for a decade now. The band reunited in 2000 after taking a break in the '90s. The highly influential guitarist and revered guitar teacher Bernie Brausewetter, of B.B. and the Stingers, often cited Doughboys' original guitarist Willy Kirchofer as an influence. Kirchofer passed unexpectedly in 2005 and Brausewetter passed prematurely in 2007.\n\nThe Doughboys will open for the 1910 Fruitgum Company, a New Jersey-based band that had hits in the '60s with \"Indian Giver,\" \"Simon Says,\" and \"1-2-3 Red Light.\"\n\nTickets are $20 at the door. The Open Arts Stage Theater is located next to Mastori's Diner on Route 130 southbound, and the show is all-ages, no alcohol.\n\nWonder Bar Blues 'n' Boogie\n\nA cavalcade of blues and roots music musicians take over the Wonder Bar, Fifth and Ocean Avenues, Asbury Park, from noon to 6 p.m. tomorrow and again at 7 p.m. with two separate revues, both part of the Light of Day marathon to raise funds for Parkinson's disease research.\n\nAsbury Blues begins at noon tomorrow with performers to include the Upstage Jam Band, Gary Wright, the Tangiers Blues Band, James Dalton, Pam McCoy, Kenny \"Stringbean\" Sorensen, the Billy Walton Band, Pat Guadagno and Richard Blackwell, RB3, Stormin' Norman Seldin, Mary McCrink, Ronnie Brandt and the Cigar Box Stompers.\n\nFrom 7 p.m. to closing at Wonder Bar, on a bill called Full Tilt Boogie, performers will include the Bob Polding Band, Eryn Shewell, the Billy Hector Band, Danny White, Virago, the Christine Martucci Band, HP and the Hot Takeout Band and Sharon Lasher and the Matt O'Ree Band.\n\nTickets to Asbury Blues or Full Tilt Boogie are $12 in advance or $15 at the door. For more information, visit www.lightofday.org.\n\nJazz among the stacks\n\nConnecticut-based jazz vocalist, songwriter and bandleader Giacomo Gates returns to the Monmouth County Library Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m. Gates and his trio always serve up an artful blend of blues, ballads and traditional jazz tunes during their two hour show. Sunday afternoon's show is free.\n\nJazz writer Will Friedwald of the New York Sun sums up Gates' live shows rather well: \"Mr. Gates is a solid example of a performer who is doing something that no one else does. He evokes an age (that I would hope is not so terribly bygone) when musicians were entertainers and entertainers were musicians, and a sense of humor was as important as a sense of rhythm.\"\n\nThe Manalapan branch of the Monmouth County Library is just off Route 9 at 125 Symmes Drive. For more information, call 732-431-7220 ext. 7222 or visit www.giacomogates.com.\n\n'Don't Call No Ambulance'\n\nFlorida-based guitarist and singer-songwriter Selwyn Birchwood is riding high and racking up the frequent flyer miles and miles on his tour bus after the success of his debut for Chicago-based Alligator Records, \"Don't Call No Ambulance.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old Birchwood took top honors in the Blues Foundation's International Blues Challenge in 2013, and his debut record for Alligator is filled with memorable original songs that break new thematic ground in the blues idiom. Birchwood got his start and earliest encouragement from a master musician who was no stranger to audiences at the Jersey Shore in the 1990s, \"The Urban Turban,\" Clarence Edward Smith, a.k.a. Sonny Rhodes. Rhodes, who spent nearly a decade in Pine Hill and other parts of southern New Jersey before moving to Sanford, Florida, insisted young Birchwood get his college education. Birchwood holds an MBA from the University of Tampa.\n\nIf you want to see contemporary blues at its best, consider getting down to the Lizzie Rose Music Room next Thursday night, Jan. 22, in Tuckerton. There, Birchwood and his band will play two or three sets beginning around 8 p.m.\n\nThe Lizzie Rose Music Room is located at 217 E. Main Street, Tuckerton, just off Exit 58 of the Garden State Parkway. Tickets are $15 in advance or $20 at the door. Patrons are free to BYOB. 609-296-4100, www.selwynbirchwood.com."
