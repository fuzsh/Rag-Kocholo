She lives in East Brunswick with her 4-year-old daughter, Emily.\n\n\"I do music, and I’m a mommy,\" she said. \"I wouldn’t be able to do this without my family. Anytime I need a baby sitter they are there for me, and they also come out to the gigs.\n\n\"I’ve played many times where there is only my mom in the crowd,\" she said.\n\nHow does she do it all as a full-time parent?\n\n\"A lot of phone calls and e-mails,\" she said, adding that she also utilizes a Web site called wheresthegig. com, which helps musicians keep track of performances.\n\nShewell (singer/songwriter/guitar) has her own original music band named after her, The Eryn Shewell Band. She formed the band in June 2007 and they are now putting out a live release called \"Live from the Cutting Room.\n\n\"\n\n\"Right now I have a nine-piece band,\" Shewell said. The band members include Pat Ruh (guitar), John MacDonald (bass), Elliot Kessler (drums), Antonio Gambrell (trumpet), Tommy Meares, (trombone), Arne Wendt (keyboards), Kathrine Verderosa (backing vocals), and Jenna Britton (backing vocals).\n\nThe band has been busy in the past year, Shewell said, playing gigs at least two to three times a week all over the tri-state area.\n\n\"I have this band and also a cover band on the side,\" she said, adding that the cover band is the one that pays the bills.\n\nShewell grew up in a music environment. She said her mother, Dawn VanArsdale, and father, Larry Shewell, both sing; her aunt Lori has been in a cover country band for 20 years, and her grandfather William Jennings plays various instruments and country and bluegrass music.\n\n\"He plays everything from banjo to guitar to accordion,\" she said, adding that family gatherings involved everyone sitting around singing and playing guitar.\n\nWhen it comes to music, \"I guess it’s in the blood,\" she said.\n\nWhat type of music does Shewell prefer to sing?\n\n\"I like to sing blues and jazz the best,\" she said. \"Rock is fun, but I prefer the other two.\n\n\"\n\nShe has followed her passion for jazz and blues to New Orleans.\n\n\"The entire city of New Orleans inspired me,\" she said. \"It was amazing.\n\n\"There is all this spirit and energy there — the horn players will walk around and play anywhere and everywhere,\" she said, \"even if a band is in the club, and they are outside playing.\n\n\"\n\nShewell has one self-released full-length record out named \"One Song at a Time.\" It’s a release she calls a \"living-room record.\n\n\"\n\n\"I did it myself in my living room,\" she said, adding she called her band members over to her house to make it.\n\nThe band has just recorded a live album at The Cutting Room in New York City, and it is due to release by the summer. It will feature a DVD of a live concert and feature clips of Shewell speaking.\n\nThe live record currently is being mixed, edited and packaged, she said.\n\nEryn Shewell will be playing acoustic gigs at 8:30 p.m. April 4 at the Twisted Tree Cafe in Asbury Park, at 10 p.m. April 12 at the Beacon Street Grill in Neptune and at 9 p.m. April 16 at Bar Anticipation in Lake Como.

Asbury Park Press Article\n\nGOING FOR BROKE\n\nShewell has stars in her eyes\n\nPosted by the Asbury Park Press on 09/29/07\n\nBY ED CONDRAN\n\nCORRESPONDENT\n\nEver since Eryn Shewell was a young girl, it's been the music industry or bust.\n\nThe East Brunswick-based singer/songwriter has had her heart set on a career as a performer ever since she was in middle school.\n\n\"I used to tell people back then that I would become famous,\" Shewell said. \"They said, \"Make sure that you have a backup in case your music doesn't work out.' Most people have a backup.\"\n\nHowever, there is no contingency plan for the 23-year-old Shewell, who grew up in Jackson. The shy, soft-spoken songsmith plays mother to her 4-year-old daughter during the day and is a musician at night.\n\n\"This is it for me,\" Shewell said. \"My family and my music is my life. There's not time for much more.\"\n\nBlues, jazz and rock are some of the styles of music Shewell will offer when she performs Sunday at the Wonder Bar's closing party.\n\n\"I love all kinds of songs, but that's what I'm doing now,\" she said. \"I would love to try it all.\"\n\nThe Washington, D.C., native, who has been writing songs since she was 8, was weaned on country music and during her teens reveled in hard rock.\n\n\"You sample different things when you're growing up,\" Shewell said. \"The stuff you listen to stays with you.\"\n\nShewell is working on her debut album with Jason Corsaro.\n\n\"We have three songs finished,\" she said. \"He's working on some other things now. I'm waiting for him so we can complete it.\"\n\nIn the interim, Shewell continues to write songs. Relationships and growing up are some of the common threads in her material.\n\n\"Something is always happening to inspire me,\" Shewell said. \"Since what I write is a reflection of my life, I have more and more songs. When you come see me, you're hearing the story of my life.\"\n\n- Asbury Park Press\n\n\"Show Review Twisted Tree Cafe\"\n\nShow Review!!\n\nTWISTED COVERS - ELVIS COSTELLO\n\nPosted on 2008-04-05\n\n(ASBURY PARK, NJ - March 30, 2008) -- Twisted Covers featured a look at the career of Elvis Costello this monday. The show, which takes place on the last Sunday of each month at the Twisted Tree Cafe on Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park, featured a bunch of show regulars alongside several new faces.\n\nSome of the artists marking their first appearance at Twisted Covers include Joe D’Urso, <b>Eryn Shewell<b>, Deena Shoshkes, Roger Gardella, Christian Beach, and Rob Neil. Regulars included Keith McCarthy, Tony Tedesco, Joe Harvard, Michael Brett, Jo Wymer, George Wirth, and Pat Roddy. I like how we now have a bunch of artists as regulars kind of like a comedy or theatre troupe would have. It’s cool to see these artists take a chance each month with banging out a few covers - especially since very few of the artists who play actually play covers in their sets. That’s what makes this show very special to me.\n\nIn case you’re unfamiliar with the show, basically artists play one or two covers by the featured artist and then play one of their originals. This allows artists the chance to introduce them to new audiences and let those people hear their own work as well. Considering that many people are more comfortable hearing songs they already know, the show is a good way to ease those folks into the local original scene.\n\nThis was the second time Twisted Covers had tried spotlighting a particular album and I think it probably was the last as well. When we tried it for Neil Young it was a resounding success, but that was a rather short album and contained a lot of popular songs that people knew. This go around, we tried highlighting a rather obscure album (Elvis Costello’s \"King Of America\") and it didn’t work nearly as well. There were some great highlights but also a bunch of low lights. From now on, we’ll just let artists pick a popular cover and a somewhat obscure cover and if we get a bunch from any one album we might try doing something with it. But we won’t be highlighting albums again.\n\n<b>Show highlights for me include Eryn Shewell’s band doing \"Eisenhower Blues\" from \"King of America\" - this was a song that I’d imagine few knew, but their take was incredibly good. In fact, I think the song sounded better than on the album. It’s one of those jazzy tunes that works better with a female voice than a males. I told Eryn I thought it went over so well that she should bring it out during one of the band’s sets sometime. Eryn also did a wonderful cover of \"Almost Blue\" that was exactly what I expected. When she first signed up for that song I knew she would nail it.<b>\n\nRoger Gardella’s take on \"Indoor Fireworks\" was wonderful as well. That probably is my favorite song on \"King of America\" and I was glad to see someone cover it.\n\nJoe D’Urso and Deena Shoshkes were welcome additions to the lineup. Joe has been a mainstay in the Jersey Shore scene for quite some time despite living in New York. His take on \"Little Palaces\" (also from \"King of America\") was extremely good and his original (a recently written piece) was a crowd favorite. Deena is the lead singer of The Cucumbers and somebody that I came across via Myspace. Turns out she has a monthly singer-songwriter show/gathering she puts together each month and was very into the idea of Twisted Covers. She played \"Loveable\" and the classic \"Radio Radio\" before launching into a brand new song which I think made its first ever live appearance. Cool stuff!\n\nMichael Brett continued to amaze me with his covers considering he rarely ever plays cover tunes when I see him live. He chose \"Watching The Detectives\" and \"Veronica\" which was cool considering how great the combination of Elvis and Paul McCartnery was on that album.\n\nRob Neil was someone I wasn’t familiar with but I enjoyed his takes on \"Alison\" (always one of Costello’s most popular tunes) and \"(What’s So Funny About) Peace, Love and Understanding\", a cover tune Elvis made big. Neil’s original tune was pretty interesting as well. It falls under the genre of \"wizard rock\" or something. I had no idea there was such a genre but it has something to do with Harry Potter...\n\nAnd Keith McCarthy once again assembled a band to do some truly great work on tunes like \"I Want You\" -- Keith and his friends are welcome anytime for this series as it seems like there is nothing they can’t play.\n\nJo Wymer, Joe Harvard, Pat Roddy, Christian Beach, George Wirth, and Tony Tedesco rounded out the show with great covers and, more importantly, great song choices. I really like how the song list doesn’t simply reflect the 10 or 20 top songs by any artist but shows a few obscure gems and forgotten classics as well. And, I love the way the original songs fit into the mix as many of the artists aren’t afraid to bring out literally brand new songs as people like Tony Tedesco did today.\n\nThe next Twisted Covers show will feature the wo - AsburyMusic.com\n\n\"ONE SONG AT A TIME...\"\n\nONE SONG AT A TIME...\n\nOriginally published in the Upstage Magazine print edition\n\nBy Gary Wien\n\nEryn Shewell not only believes that music can change the world one song at a time, but she's making others believe as well. She's one of the hardest working musicians in New Jersey and has been attracting the attention of music fans and club owners across the state as well. Recently nominated for several Asbury Music Awards, we finally had a chance to talk to Eryn about her career, her belief in music, and her little girl who might follow in her footsteps if she doesn't become a drummer first.\n\nI first saw Eryn Shewell at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park over a year ago and was blown away by her performance. It's hard to believe, but she says that was her first ever live performance of her originals. Since then, her songs have gotten better and her band is now comprised of amazingly talented musicians that bring her rock and roll / country tunes alive with a touch of jazz and blues flavoring. The band includes John MacDonald on bass, Antonio Gambrell on trumpet and backing vocals, Pat Ruh on guitar, Elliot Kessler on drums, Kat Verderosa on backing vocals, and Doug Scocco on organ and keyboards.\n\n\"It boggles my mind that I have all these talented people that are doing so much for me and I don't even know how to thank them,\" said Shewell. \"I thank whatever the powers that may be for them everyday. I'm a lucky girl.\"\n\nShewell has floated under the radar a bit by playing shows at many untraditional original music venues. In addition to her original band she also fronts a cover band called Stronger Than Dirt. Playing in both bands allows her to work on different angles of her music and helps her make more connections in the area.\n\n\"I love doing both,\" she explained. \"It's two different worlds. With my originals I get to be more creative and the songs have more meaning. My cover band stuff lets me kind of just let it loose and rock out a bit.\"\n\nBorn in Washington, DC, Shewell moved to New Jersey when she was 8. Since then she has been lead singer for the country band Sundance, pop/rock band Easily Amuzed, and was a member of the popular New Jersey band Jody Joseph & The Average Joes. She recently won over audiences in New Orleans singing with national touring band Soul Project.\n\nEryn's taste in music was partly influenced by her parents. Her father listened to the Rat Pack while her mother was into country music. In high school, Eryn began getting into jazz artists like Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday. Throw in some classic rock and those are the influences found in her songs. It's an interesting blend that has a distinct sound of its own.\n\nShewell and her band play throughout New Jersey and places in Pennsylvania and New York. Their biggest gig to date was last August's Musikfest, the 10-day music festival that takes place in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The band played in front of thousands of people who listened to every note played.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" said Shewell. \"When it was said over the microphone that we had free CDs, it was like a bum rush to the table! We ran out of CDs and started handing out promos without covers or even cases. Then we ran out of everything! It was crazy!\"\n\nEryn is currently recording an album with Grammy award-winning producer Jason Corsaro (Madonna, Sound Garden, Peter Gabriel, Mariah Carey). The process is taking longer than she'd like, but she hopes to have the\n\nnew record out sometime in 2008.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov 6, 2007 The Saint, Asbury Park, NJ\n\nNov 7, 2007 Internet Cafe, Red Bank, NJ\n\nNov 9, 2007 The Blue Room Lounge, Secaucus, NJ\n\nNov 10, 2007 Orphan Annies, Stirling, NJ\n\nNov 21, 2007 Internet Cafe, Red Bank, NJ\n\nNov 23, 2007 Rug's & Riffy's, Woodbridge, NJ\n\nNov 24, 2007 Molly Maguire's, Clark, NJ\n\nNov 27, 2007 Dexters, Riverdale, NJ\n\nDec 4, 2007 North Star Bar, Philadelphia, PA\n\nhttp://www.ErynShewell.com\n\nGary Wien --\n\nPHOTO by Mike Black\n\n- Upstage Magazine\n\n\"Boys: watch and learn, Girls Night Out on May 21\"\n\nBoys: watch and learn, Girls Night Out on May 21\n\nLooks like the boys might have some catching up to do this month.

The musicians are tight, and the music is loose, a feel-good mix of soul, country, and blues – a little something for everyone. Shewell has a voice that cuts through a crowd, she could probably keep singing with the band if her mic went out. And she has a penchant for hitting on a particular simple phrase and hammering it home in a chorus – “Just One of Those Days,” “One More Melody,” “I Don’t Know.” By the time her songs are over, you will remember the chorus whether you want to or not.\n\nStylistically, Shewell stays in mostly familiar territory on Window Pane. “I Don’t Know” and “Just One of Those Days” could be lost tracks from Blues Traveler’s Four. “I Want You for Breakfast” is the kind of comely cute ballad Jewel has made her trademark. Most of the album is the musical equivalent of comfort food. Funny thing about comfort food, though, if it didn’t taste good, you wouldn’t eat it. And to stretch the metaphor even further, Shewell is happy to serve up tasty helpings of it.\n\nAlthough she can be a little overwrought at times, Shewell’s voice adapts well to bright country rock or sassy blues, whatever’s needed for the song at hand. And her band is impressive, from the horn section playing funky breaks to her rock-leaning electric guitarist to the tasty grooves her bass and keyboard players lock into. Everyone fills when they need to, no one steps on anyone else’s toes or makes the arrangements too busy. Window Pane may not blow you away with its originality, but you won’t kick it out of bed for eating crackers. (Ouch. Back to the food thing. What a hack).\n\nWords By: Nick A. Zaino III\n\n- Skope Magazine\n\n\"Review of \"Window Pane\"\"\n\nOctober, 2008\n\nTranslation:\n\nUsing a perfect mix of rock, blues, jazz, soul and even a little bit of country, Eryn Shewell introduces her music to us. Her debut album is filled with strong compositions, songs with catchy hooks and strong melodies. And not only that, she possesses the perfect voice to bring those songs to us. A voice that reminds us of the debuts of Joss Stone and Susan Tedeschi. We then also told you, \"This girl is gonna get far\"...and weren’t we right both times? Well, we dare to say the same thing about Eryn Shewell. Maybe it will be a little more difficult for her, because there is no major record company to promote her, but with the mouth to mouth publicity she gets from the strong live performances she and her strong band bring us, her name will be known in no time. From her hometown, Asbury Park in New Jersey to New Orleans and beyond, she performed in the most important clubs and everywhere the audiences go wild. The songs on this CD are all strong and from the second time you hear them, they stay... it's difficult to get them out of your head again. But who cares? These are Songs that are waiting to get played on the radio too. Eryn's voice is so strong and flexible, filled with a lot of soul. From high to low, from a whisper to a scream, she brings it without the least of effort. Those are the signs of a real class singer. Others have noticed this too, because she is a much sought after backing vocalist, recently even on Walter \"Wolfman\" Washington's latest CD. A song like \"I Don't Know\" is a good example of her songwriter qualities, just like the strong \"The Lonely Writer\" (that guitar!) or the funky, jazzy sounding \"Window Pane,\" in which her voice reminds me a lot of Joss Stone. The quiet \"One Song at a Time\" has a bluesy feel to it. What a great, soulfull song this is! Whatever song we chose they are all \"winners\". \"Just One of Those Days\" even has some country influences, which could easily make it big on Nashville radio. She has been compared with Jewel and Martina Mc Bride in some press articles, and we can understand why. The closing song, the wonderfully sung \"I Want You For Breakfast\" shows it: this girl knows what she wants and she will get it! Let us hope it is \"success,\" because that is what she really deserves.

Although I've been going to shows regularly, I just don't feel the need to do show reviews unless something really clicks for me. Tonight was one of those nights. Even though the lineup featured three artists I've seen quite often, the show itself was worth writing about......\n\n....The final act of the night, the Eryn Shewell Band, is the reason for this review. I've been very impressed with Eryn and her music for several years now, but I think the band has fully come into their own. They recently returned from recording in Nashville and the trip seems to have done them a lot of good. They've got a sort of confidence now that was lacking somewhat in the past. Take Eryn for example. In the few years that I've known her, I've watched Eryn transform from a rather timid backup singer to a full band leader that's clearly in charge. Likewise, her music is eloquently executed by some of the area's strongest musicians. Together, they all combine to produce one if the best live shows you will ever see.\n\nIn fact, I think her band's music is meant to be experienced live. Yes, their studio recordings are good, but they pale in comparison with the thunderous roar of her live shows. It's an experience that can't be matched on tape; It's part roadhouse, part arena, and part tent revival - a sound that picks you up and raises you to a place that few can reach.\n\nIt's funny, thinking about how so many bands compete to be the house band for the Stone Pony while Eryn and her band just might be the ultimate house band for The Saint. Their music fits the club like a glove, filling every crevice of the joint as if the club was her own. And tonight, it was.\n\n- Gary Wien\n\n\"Eryn Shewell - 4th & Broadway\"\n\nAbout a year ago we received Eryn Shewell's debut album, a record that impressed us enormously. Her special mix of blues, jazz and Motown soul was refreshing. More than that, her powerful, soulful voice was a revelation to us. Her first album “Window Pane” remains one of a few debut records released last year that I continue to listen to over and over again. It continues to grow on me after all these months. Why? Because \"Window Pane\" was filled to the brim with strong songs, brought with craftmanship and delivered with that wonderful voice that sounds full, powerful and also tender at the same time and is always dripping with soul. In the review of “Window Pane” we predicted Eryn would have a great future, or at least hoped she would gain lots of recognition, because she simply deserved it. There is talent in abundance here.\n\nToday I am listening to Eryn's recently released sophomore CD, named \"4th & Broadway.\" a record which continues in the same direction as her first. This is a CD that is full of variation, using similar elements as on her debut, but in our opinion has even stronger, more mature songs. As happens so often these days, big record companies don't always notice potential like Eryns because it is surprsing to us that this album is also an independent release. Maybe it's the versatility of this singer that scares the majors, she may be difficult to label..not enough blues, jazz or soul to pin her down into one specifc genre. We believe the best of popmusic is built on these three strong genres and the fusion of genres is this CD's greatest strength. The songs Eryn writes are so strong that they transcend the standard blues, jazz and soul we hear so often and Eryn always adds something of her own. These songs get better every time you listen to them not the other way around as often happens with the music we receive for review.\n\nSongs like the very soulful, somewhat jazzy sounding \"Moment\" and the passionate \"Satellite\" are real gems. They get to you immediately and you'll be sure to be humming them after a short time listening to them. Eryn's strong lyrics about modern everyday life in relation to her own experiences will certainly touch your soul.\n\nOne of our favorite tracks on this new cd is \"300 Miles\", a song with an Alternative Country, Americana feeling to it achieved with some great playing by master pedal-steel guitarist Sam Getz.\n\nThe rest of the band is also top notch, including bass player Steve Johnson, drummer Tom Cottone, trumpet player Antonio Gambrell and the backing vocalists. Alice Leon and Curtis King are both wonderful musicians, and the recording is crystal clear and mixed to perfection.\n\nEryn's love for the blues is best heard in the relaxed sounding blues track \"Whiskey Devil\", another one of my favorites, being a blues lover myself. \"My Soul\" is another one I can't get enough of and has some great slide by Pat Ruh.\n\nWe sincerely hope with the release of this album Eryn Shewell will get the attention and success she really deserves. Perhaps, things are starting in that direction already, we understand she just won the \"Top Female Vocalist\" award at the Asbury Music Awards this year.

Credit it to stresses in society or simply the coming of age of a new generation of songwriters, but it’s undeniable: the poignantness of the messages in the poetry and music being crafted by independent artists is on the rise.\n\nMost certainly this will continue as songwriters continue to survey and interpret the global political landscape and relate it to their personal lives. Now, I said all that just so I could cap it by adding that I think Eryn Shewell is one of the most “in tune with the times” songwriters I’ve had the pleasure of reviewing in recent memory. Her lyrics run from soft and playful to rugged and meaty, which, reflects her style of performing.\n\nHer music is consistently interesting, and always emphasizes the lyrics. Most of her tunes ride on the edgy side of pop, touching upon both blues and jazz. She has excellent vocal control, a powerful, yet very sincere, voice and loads of energy, making her an exceptional live performance. Hailing from East Brunswick, NJ, Eryn is self-taught on the guitar (a necessity for a songwriter) and has intelligently backed her own natural talents by being trained as a sound engineer, in order to better understand the science behind achieving the perfect sound.\n\nHer Live2Play quote is,\"Music has always been my passion, my therapeutic outlet, I’m not just chasing fame - this is my career. I will always work in the music industry in some capacity.\"\n\n- Live2Play Network\n\n\"SHOW REVIEW - Eryn Shwell Band Comes Into\"\n\n(ASBURY PARK, NJ – March 3, 2009) – I wasn't originally planning on writing a review of this show, but figured I'd do a write-up since people have emailed me saying I hadn't done much with the blog lately. Although I've been going to shows regularly, I just don't feel the need to do show reviews unless something really clicks for me. Tonight was one of those nights. Even though the lineup featured three artists I've seen quite often, the show itself was worth writing about......\n\n....The final act of the night, the Eryn Shewell Band, is the reason for this review. I've been very impressed with Eryn and her music for several years now, but I think the band has fully come into their own. They recently returned from recording in Nashville and the trip seems to have done them a lot of good. They've got a sort of confidence now that was lacking somewhat in the past. Take Eryn for example. In the few years that I've known her, I've watched Eryn transform from a rather timid backup singer to a full band leader that's clearly in charge. Likewise, her music is eloquently executed by some of the area's strongest musicians. Together, they all combine to produce one if the best live shows you will ever see.\n\nIn fact, I think her band's music is meant to be experienced live. Yes, their studio recordings are good, but they pale in comparison with the thunderous roar of her live shows. It's an experience that can't be matched on tape; It's part roadhouse, part arena, and part tent revival - a sound that picks you up and raises you to a place that few can reach.\n\nIt's funny, thinking about how so many bands compete to be the house band for the Stone Pony while Eryn and her band just might be the ultimate house band for The Saint. Their music fits the club like a glove, filling every crevice of the joint as if the club was her own. And tonight, it was.\n\n- Gary Wien"
