Harrison Salisbury New York Times editor NEW YORK Harrison Salisbury, a longtime reporter and editor for the New York Times whose Cold War dispatches from the Soviet Union won the Pulitzer Prize, died Monday in Providence, R.I., while returning from a trip to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. During the 84-year-old's six-decade career, he reported extensively from the then-Soviet Union and Asia and was the author of more than 25 books, most on those areas. He was also among a handful of top Times editors who in 1971 made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, the classified report detailing U.S .\n\ninvolvement in Vietnam. Over President Nixon's objections, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the paper's right to publish the documents. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1955 for international reporting for a 14- part series called \"Russia ReViewed,\" in which he described the fear and terror under Stalin. It was one of the first times Soviet authorities didn't censor his stories .\n\nAmong his books were, \"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad\" and \"The Long March: The Untold about the trek of Mao Tse-tung and the Red Army.
