        "text": "<strong>Texas</strong> Woman’s <strong>University</strong> Former Students Association <strong>Summer</strong>/<strong>Fall</strong> <strong>2012</strong> PIONEER Class Notes Greengs fellow Pioneers! One of the privileges of serving as FSA President is that I get to preview these notes before you get them. What a joy! I laughed, cried, applauded, and cheered as I read through each entry. All of you are a true source of inspiraon. Our stories connect us ‐ please don’t ever stop sharing. …and speaking of sharing. I’d like to tell you all a lile bit about what your FSA Board has been up to these past few months. If this turns out to be “old news” just skip this secon and go on to the good stuff! At the FSA Chapter Officers/Board Workshop on June 30, <strong>2012</strong>, Dr. Ann Stuart, TWU Chancellor and President asked FSA to consider its future role with TWU and invited us to be a part of the new structure as a Chartered Alumni Group under the Office of Alumni Relaons. Aer in‐depth analysis and discussion, the FSA Board voted on Saturday, August 4th, to become a Charter group of the TWU Office of Alumni Relaons effecve September 1, <strong>2012</strong>. I believe the two most significant items of note for most of us are: 1)FSA will have an official affiliaon with TWU while maintaining our 501(3)c status and 2) FSA will move from a dues based to a donaon‐based membership (membership donaons will be tax deducble). The summary report and associated documentaon are available upon request. Inquiries may be sent directly to the FSA Office or to me. Please join me as we use this transion year to RE‐FOCUS, RE‐ ENERGIZE, AND RE‐CONNECT! Sincerely, Patricia Edwards, Class of ‘77 ‘79 ‘98 Former Student Associaon President Gladys Barns Lawhon, class agent for the Class of 1930, recently celebrated her 100th birthday with a family and friends gettogether. She is sll in good health and enjoys keeping up with her classmates. She lives in Denton and also keeps up with goings on at the Denton TWU campus. Congratulaons and thanks, Gladys, for 82 years and counng of parcipaon. Class of 1925 CLASS AGENT: Mildred Burgess Hurley, 479‐968‐1233 Class of 1930 CLASS AGENT: Gladys Barns Lawhon, 2422 Nongham, Denton, TX 76209, 940‐382‐8563, gladl01@charter.net Alta Parn Harper from Teague, TX died April 21, <strong>2012</strong>. Class of 1937 CLASS AGENT: Marjorie Collier Hall, 2611 Lake Air Drive, Waco, TX 76710 830‐377‐1303 bbkirk@me.com I have oen said that there are three parts to every experience—the ancipaon, the experience itself, and the memories it creates. Well, I can honestly say that all three aspects of my class reunion far exceeded my expectaons! Even though I was the only member of my class of 1937 to aend, I so enjoyed geng to see and catch up with many other old friends and alumni. It was also so good to be back on the TWU campus where I have countless wonderful memories. I especially enjoyed the wonderful reunion dinner on Saturday evening. Many thanks to all those who made the weekend possible. Who knows, maybe I will be able to aend the next one too! Class of 1938 ‐ no agent Class of 1939 CLASS AGENT: Jane Robin Ellis, 509 St. Charles Dr., Arlington, TX 76013, 817‐548‐8511, jarobel@a.net Jane Robin Ellis reports that she received a list of the “remains of ‘39” borrowing from the words of September Song, I will say that the numbers of our class are dwindling down to a precious few. Many phone numbers were not acve‐which tells me its own story, and I’m sure that more than one of us sounded a trifle “wispy”, but those who were available, who understood what was happening, and who remembered the bright days of our me of sharing and preparing for our future here on “broad and rolling plains” were yet 1"
