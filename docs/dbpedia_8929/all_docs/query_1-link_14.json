        "text": "If Holmdel guitarist Matt O’Ree hasn’t seen a million faces yet from the stage, he’s well on his way.\n\nAnd yes, he’s rocking them all.\n\nO’Ree has just returned from Asia and the Middle East, where he played nine shows as guitarist for Bon Jovi. Yup, that’s Bon Jovi, as in one of the biggest rock bands in the world.\n\nO’Ree and his Matt O’Ree Band will have a homecoming show Friday, Oct. 30 at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.\n\n“It was an unbelievable experience to play in Bon Jovi,” said O’Ree. “I’m so happy to have been there and it was an absolute blessing for me. It was an unbelievable experience to play in arenas and stadiums.”\n\nThe rest of the world it catching on to what Jersey Shore music fans have known for a while now: O’Ree is the real thing.\n\n“He’s the Jersey Shore’s most beloved musician and the hottest guitarist at the Shore,” said Stone Pony booker Kyle Brendle. “Everybody’s real excited for Matt to come home and excited for Matt’s success.”\n\n“The Pony is going to be rocking.”\n\nO’Ree knows what he’s doing up there, as he’s the frontman for his own band. He played his first show at Fairleigh Dickinson University when he was 16, has hit just about every club and stage in Jersey and in the region since then and in 2006, he won the prestigious Guitarmageddon “King of the Blues” guitar contest, hosted by B.B. King and John Mayer and sponsored by Guitar Center and Guitar World Magazine.\n\nHe beat out 4,000 guitar players.\n\nHe’s a blues-based old-soul rocker who’s very much in the moment, taking elements of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Duane Allman and Jimi Hendrix, charging it up and delivering a wonderfully ignited sound. His raspy vocals have soul, power and feeling.\n\n“Matt’s style is more based in the roots, blues and rock area, but obviously if you can play as a touring guitarist for Bon Jovi, Matt can step up and play anything,” Brendle said. “He’s an amazing talent.”\n\nA talent molded by an unexpected player. The late New Brunswick-based guitarist Bernie Brausewetter of B.B. and the Stingers and the Slaves of New Brunswick fame was hugely influential, O’Ree said.\n\n“I saw Bernie play at the (now-closed) Playpen Lounge in Sayreville,” O’Ree said. “I walked in and I couldn’t believe how much like Jimi Hendrix he was. I have never seen Jimi Hendrix, but watching Bernie play, it was eye opening and I said ‘I get it, I understand what I want to do. I want to play guitar and solo whenever I want. I want the creative freedom to do that.’“\n\nThe two worked together on technique and stylistic points and practical points, too.\n\n“Bernie told me that I should be teaching (guitar) full time,” O’Ree said. “If you’re teaching, you can rearrange your classes to work around scheduling changes instead of having a full-time job where you’d have to fight with your boss to get time off.”\n\nO’Ree was playing a smaller gig at Jamians Food and Drink in Red Bank when a keyboard player from Edison walked in.\n\nIt was David Bryan of Bon Jovi.\n\n“Dave stopped in one night with a mutual friend and asked if he could sit in,” O’Ree said. “We started playing together and from the first note I was, ‘OK, there’s a connection here.’ We seemed like old friends.”\n\nAfter that, Bryan would often join O’Ree at local shows, such as at the Colts Neck Inn. When Bryan need a guitarist, it would be O’Ree, such as an event tied in with the Memphis premiere of Bryan’s Tony Award-winning play, “Memphis.”\n\nThen one day, a call. Then an audition. Then a trip to the Fetish clothing store in Asbury Park for stagewear before a flight on a jet plane to Asia.\n\nO’Ree joined full-time members Jon Bon Jovi, vocals; Bryan, keyboards and Tico Torres, drums, along with touring members Hugh McDonald on bass and Phil “Phil X” Xenidis, who replaced the departed Richie Sambora on guitar in 2013.\n\nO’Ree replaced Bobby Bandiera in the touring band. There’s been no reason given for the switch and O’Ree said that his own status in Bon Jovi is to be determined.\n\n“It was a great experience for me and I was definitely doing lead guitar,” O’Ree said. “I definitely wasn’t in the shadows. I hope I added more to the show for the band.”\n\nHere at the Jersey Shore, there was an outpouring of love and affection for the hometown kid done good.\n\n“So glad your dreams came true,” posted Mary Ellen Ellis of Middletown on O’Ree’s Facebook page. “It’s amazing ... I’m so happy for you.”\n\n“I was overwhelmed by that,” O’Ree said of the postings.\n\nComing up is for O’Ree and crew is a new Matt O’Ree Band album with a few special guests aboard, including Bryan.\n\n“The attention this has gained for the Matt O’Ree Band makes it that much easier for us to release our new record,” said O’Ree, who has signed with 107 Productions management.\n\nBut first, it’s the Stone Pony, where O’Ree and his bandmates -- Eric Safka, keyboards; Scott Bennert, bass and John Hummel drums -- will be joined by Shore sirens Layonne Holmes and Eryn Shewell, O’Ree’s girlfriend, on vocals, and guest stars like pal Bryan.\n\nColossal Street Jam and the Taylor Tote Band will open the show.\n\n“I’m excited to be back home and get a chance to play for friends and family,” O’Ree said. “I’m back from the Far East.”\n\nUpcoming shows:\n\nWelcome Home Matt O’Ree with the Matt O’Ree Band, Colossal Street Jam and the Taylor Tote Band, 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 30, Stone Pony, Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park. $12 in advance/$15 at the door. 732-502-0600; www.stoneponyonline.com.\n\n8 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 5, Mexicali Live, 1409 Queen Anne Road, Teaneck. 201-833-0011; www.ticketweb.com.\n\nOpening for Whitford/St. Holmes, 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 18, B.B.
