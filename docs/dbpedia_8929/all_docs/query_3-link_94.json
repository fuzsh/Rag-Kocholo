        "text": "Welcome to my musical world! This is one man’s attempt to alert you to the best in area entertainment!\n\nDon Felder has been making music since he was around ten years old when he ‘acquired’ his first guitar. Growing up in Gainsville, Fl. Felder had some very intersting musical friends in his community, most notably Stephen Stills, Tom Petty, Bernie Leadon and even the man who taught him to play slide guitar, Duane Allman.\n\nThis Friday Felder pulls into the Golden Nugget Atlantic City for a 9 p.m. show in support of his latest CD ‘Road To Forever,’ a twelve track effort that he calls ‘an uplifting experience.’ Recently I spoke with Felder in advance of this upcoming show in A.C. The following is part of our conversation:\n\nRock On: Without dwelling on your past, what can you tell me about the musicians that you grew up with?\n\nFelder: ‘Yea, we all grew up in the same little town. It’s unique to have one person or group make it, in our case we had several. I mean, Tom Petty was a guitar student of mine, Stephen Stills and I formed my first band together called The Continentals, I met (Eagles founding member) Bernie Leadon in high school and Duane and Greg Allman used to play frat parties at the local university here in Gainsville. They were better than us (laughing), we used to go see them often. I started hanging around them, as a matter of fact Duane Allman is the one who taught me to play slide guitar. I don’t know maybe there was something in the water or what we were all drinking (laughs)!’\n\nRock On: I just have to ask, can you tell me about your years with the Eagles? I mean, you wrote one of the greatest rock songs of all time ‘Hotel California,’ what was that like?\n\nFelder: ‘Well, Bernie (Leadon) and I were friends, I did some work on a track in studio for the band and it all kind of fell together from there. ‘Hotel California?’ I wrote that song with Frey and Henley, I did write a great deal of it. I remember we were all sitting around working on it and I forget who it was but someone said, ‘Play that Mexican reggae song,’ refering to the chords of that song as they apparently reminded them of someting Latin American I suppose. The funny part was, a year earlier I had written the song with (Joe) Walsh guitar riffs in mind. We got to the studio and we were trying to lay down those parts at the end when Henley interrupts the process; he kind of busts in and says, ‘Stop! That’s not like the demo.’ I didn’t have the demo tape with me, it was in my home in California. I had to call the cleaning lady and ask her to follow my directions so that she could locate the tape in the house and send it out to us in the studio (laughs). So yea, that solo at the end of the song was recorded a year prior to the rest of ‘Hotel California.’I guess it all worked out for the best though (laughing).\n\nRock On: I know that you’re having some ‘issues’ with some members of the Eagles, do you keep in contact with any of the guys?\n\nFelder: ‘Oh sure. I’m very friendly with the guys, Randy (Meisner) is great and Joe Walsh I speak somewhat regularly; some are easy to reach, others not so much.’\n\nRock On: Along those lines, you’re working with a new band and a new CD ‘Road To Forever,’ what can you tell me about the new disc?\n\nFelder: ‘It was a really interesting experience to put this project together. I mean I went from being in the biggest band in America at the time, to going solo. It’s funny how the whole thing came about, I meditate, when I’d be finished with my meditation I would always write down my thoughts or what came to me during the process. My fiance would encourage me to put them together in some kind of order, she said that I should try writing a book. I actually did, I wrote an autobiography ‘Heaven And Hell’ about my time in the Eagles. Go figure, the guy who was perhaps the poorest English student ever, writes a book that winds up on the New York Times Best Seller List (laughs).’ Using the same process, I wrote songs based on these same experiences from meditation. I started with twenty six ideas, created sixteen songs and from that took twelve to put on the disc. It was a cathartic process but a great process, very emotional songs. I also had some great old friends join me on it as well. I had Stlls, Graham Nash, Randy Jackson who is just phenomenal, Tom Shaw to name a few. Making this CD was an uplifting experience as opposed to the Eagles drama. We were all in aggreement, we had a commanality of experiences that brought us, as musicians together on this CD; just great people and so much fun to work with.’\n\nRock On: Have you ever played the Golden Nugget prior to this Friday?\n\nFelder: ‘No I haven’t. I prefer to play smaller rooms as opposed to larger venues. I’ve played huge arenas and hockey rinks where the sound, no matter the size of the P.A. it’s a struggle to control the sound. A nice small room allows the audience to feel much more a part of the show. I truly am looking forward to performing here.’\n\nAlong with these brief excerpts, it should be noted that I spoke with Felder for approximately a half an hour. I was treated to a wide range of insight into the man and his music, his trials and tribulations with the Eagles and his excitement of touring and performing once again. Tickets for this show are $44.02 and $33.85 and are available through The Golden Nugget Box Office or on line at http://goldennugget.com/atlanticcity/show_performers.asp . To find more information about Don Felder please visit his web site at www.donfelder.com .\n\nFriday evening our good buddies Jerry Monk and Paul Plumeri will be returning to the stage as a duo at 9 p.m. when they set up at The Tir Na Nog located on Hamilton Ave. in Trenton. Join these two veteran performers as they bring you select covers, originals and some of the best guitar playing to be found anywhere. Prior to stopping there, why not stop by the Olde Liberty Tavern where I’ll be hosting a ‘Rock On Radio’ happy hour event featuring music from the fantastic Sharon Lia. Join us as I give away T-shirts and take monetary donations of any amount for the ‘Musicians On A Mission Hurricane Relief Fund’ www.musiciansonamission.org benefitting Jersey shore charities. We’ll be there from 6-8 p.m. so stop on by and quench your thirst for a great cause.\n\nSunday from noon to 6 p.m. in Trenton at RHO Waterfront is the ‘8th Annual Jam For Life’ benefitting organ and tissue transplant and donation. Pappa Carl Anderson is once again bringing this fabulous event to light along with his co-creator Lisa Bouchelle and her band. There will be door prizes, silent auctions, a reduced $5 menu and the very best of local entertainment. The Dadz, Honey Spot Blvd., Charles Laurita Band, Ernie White with Paul Plumeri and Joe Zook and many more will all take the stage prior to headliners Jimmy & The Parrots. I am honored to once again be the emcee for the day and look very much forward to doing so. Tickets are $20 and are available at RHO. To find out more about The Jam For Life, please visit www.jamforlifefoundation.org. Immediately following the Jam will be the return of The Singer/Songwriter Acoustic Showcase. Lance Reichert has assembled yet another fine group of musicians to continue the party until 9 p.m. www.serioussongwriter.com\n\nPlease continue to support live and original music, as you can see, the musicians are always supporting and giving their time freely to help but without your support things aren’t the same. So until next week…ROCK ON!\n\nTHIS WEEKS CALENDAR LISTINGS Alchemist & Barrister\n\n28 Witherspoon Street Princeton\n\n(609) 924-5555 www.alchemistandbarrister.com\n\nWed. 10 p.m. Open mic. night All shows 21+\n\nAmarones Windsor Inn 29 Church St. Windsor\n\n(609) 448-7144 www.amaronesrestaurant.com\n\nThurs. 6:30 p.m. Walter Brooks\n\nFri. 8 p.m. Donnie Love Sat. 8 p.m. Heartbreak Hotel\n\nTues. 7:30 p.m. Texas Hold’em Wed. 6:30 p.m. Mix & Mingle w/ Professional Singles feat.
