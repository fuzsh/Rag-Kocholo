About Eryn Shewell

Eryn has developed a reputation as one of the premier up and coming voices on the scene today. Originally from MD and now living in NJ, Eryn's style is heavily influenced by the musical traditions of the south. Her respect for the traditions of Jazz, Blues and Country fused with her modern pop style and brought together by Eryn's incredible vocal ability has been said to give even the most hardened critic chills.

In venues such as the Mayo Performing Arts Center, The NJ State Theater, Newton Theater, The legendary Stone Pony, Bluebird Café, Count Basie Theater, as well as other popular clubs throughout New Jersey, New York City, Florida, New Orleans and Nashville, many crowds and hearts have been won over by the power and sweet sound of the young talented singer and songsmith, Eryn Shewell.

A recent press article described Eryn as having "the power to woo audiences into an amused silence", with a "seductive range changing voice,,," "...bending and moving to the music, especially in tunes where her voice trails off in jam band moments of pleasant belting-meets-screaming... when songs later her voice is soft as butter and seems to roll off and melt into the air around you."

Eryn has found inspiration in her musical family and chose music as her career at an early age. She has been singing publically since she was ten, wrote her first song at fourteen and hasn't stopped writing since. She taught herself guitar to help facilitate her songwriting and performing and trained as a sound engineer so she could better understand some of the science behind the perfect sound.

"Music has always been my passion, my therapeutic outlet. I’m not just chasing fame; this is my career. I will always work in the music industry in some capacity," she says in her soft speaking voice that belies the powerful tonality that is her trademark.

Eryn began singing professionally at age thirteen when she started a ten year run singing with country band Sundance. By sixteen she was also singing backup with Jody Joseph and the Average Joes. In 2005 she spent several months in New Orleans winning over audiences while singing with national touring band The Soul Project and Walter "Wolman" Washington.

In 2007 Eryn started her own band The Eryn Shewell Band performing mostly her own original compositions. Within the first year Eryn and her band were recognized with three Asbury Music Awards nominations and has been nominated each year in more and more categories. In 2009, Eryn won the Top Female Vocalist award. In 2011 she won Top Female Vocalist and Top Blues Band.

Eryn embraces every opportunity to perform and write music. She is sought out by other artists as a backup singer because of her natural ability to harmonize. While in New Orleans she was honored to record vocals for blues veteran Walter "Wolfman" Washington's album Doing the Funky Thing. “I love working with other artists and experiencing their music. I have learned something from everyone I've had the pleasure to perform or write with. It’s not the same if I can’t share it anyway,” she says, smiling as she quotes a line from one of her songs. Since then she has then recorded and shared the stage with other artists such as Don Mclean, Gregg Allman, Gin Blossoms, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Little River Band, Glen Burtnik, Marsha Ball, Eric Lindell, Sonny Landreth, Steve Ferrone, Bernard Purdy, and many more.

In 2012 Eryn folded The Eryn Shewell Band after many years of touring back and forth from the Jersey shore to Nashville to New Orleans. In 2013 she started a new band called Eryn Shewell and the Whiskey Devils. She released her 4th album after rebuilding her band as she looks to make a big move forward and follow in the footsteps of other NJ legends.

Eryn's latest self titled release has received some rave reviews in international magazines and online e-zines as well as being currently played on international radio. Eryn hopes to make her next big move towards international audiences.
