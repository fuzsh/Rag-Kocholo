Profession: French President

Biography: Georges Pompidou was a French politician who served as the President of France from 1969 until his death in 1974. Before his presidency, he was the Prime Minister of France under President Charles de Gaulle from 1962 to 1968, making him the longest-serving Prime Minister in the history of France.

Pompidou was a key figure in the Gaullist movement. He was an educator by profession, teaching literature at the lycée (high school) level before joining the Banque Rothschild, where he rose to become a bank manager. He later transitioned into government service and became one of Charles de Gaulle's most trusted aides.

Pompidou's ascent in French politics began in earnest when he joined General Charles de Gaulle during the liberation of France in World War II. Following the war, he served as de Gaulle's chief of staff and was a pivotal figure in the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958. After de Gaulle's return to power, Pompidou was appointed as Prime Minister and played a critical role in the government's handling of the social and political upheaval during the May 1968 protests, which saw massive general strikes and student demonstrations.

As President, succeeding Charles de Gaulle in 1969, Pompidou sought to modernize France's economy and industry, continuing the transformation of France into a modern, post-industrial society. He also presided over the expansion of the European Economic Community and was an advocate for the development of a European political union.

His presidency, however, also faced economic difficulties, including inflation and unemployment. Internationally, Pompidou sought to maintain France's independent stance in world affairs, continuing de Gaulle's policy of détente with the Eastern Bloc and the policy of Francophonie, which aimed to foster closer relations between French-speaking countries.

Georges Pompidou's health began to deteriorate during his presidency, and he died in office of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a rare form of leukemia, in 1974. His legacy is remembered in various cultural institutions, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, which houses the Bibliothèque publique d'information, a vast public library, and the Musée National d'Art Moderne, the largest museum for modern art in Europe.
