        "text": "Georges Pompidou (born July 5, 1911, Montboudif, France—died April 2, 1974, Paris) was a French statesman, bank director, and teacher who was premier of the Fifth French Republic from 1962 to 1968 and president from 1969 until his death.\n\nThe son of a schoolteacher, Pompidou graduated from the École Normale Supérieure and then taught school in Marseilles and Paris. During World War II he fought as a lieutenant and won the Croix de Guerre. In late 1944 he was introduced to Charles de Gaulle, who was then head of the provisional French government. At this time Pompidou was a complete stranger to politics, but he soon proved adept at interpreting and presenting de Gaulle’s policies. Pompidou served from 1944 to 1946 on de Gaulle’s personal staff and remained a member of his “shadow Cabinet” after de Gaulle’s sudden resignation from the premiership in January 1946. He then was assistant to the general commissioner for tourism (1946–49) and also held the post of maître des requêtes at the Conseil d’État, France’s highest administrative court (1946–57).\n\nIn 1955 he entered the Rothschild bank in Paris where, again without professional qualifications, he rose rapidly to become director general (1959). De Gaulle had never lost touch with Pompidou, and, on his return to power at the time of the Algerian crisis (June 1958), he took Pompidou as his chief personal assistant (June 1958–January 1959). Pompidou played an important part in drafting the constitution of the Fifth Republic and in preparing plans for France’s economic recovery. When de Gaulle became president (January 1959), Pompidou resumed his private occupations. In 1961 Pompidou was sent to conduct secret negotiations with the Algerian Front de Libération Nationale (FLN), a mission that finally led to a cease-fire between the French troops and Algerian guerrillas in Algeria.\n\nThe Algerian crisis resolved, de Gaulle decided to replace Michel Debré as premier and appointed Pompidou, then virtually unknown to the public, in his place (April 1962). Defeated in a vote of censure in the National Assembly (October 1962), Pompidou resumed office after de Gaulle’s victory that same month in the plebiscite on the election of the president by universal suffrage. The second Pompidou administration (December 1962–January 1966) was succeeded by the third (January 1966–March 1967) and the fourth (April 1967–July 1968). Pompidou had thus been premier for six years and three months, a phenomenon that de Gaulle noted had been unknown in French politics for four generations.\n\nPompidou’s standing was probably highest at the time of the French student–worker revolt of May 1968, at which time he participated in negotiations with workers and employers, persuaded de Gaulle to make the necessary reforms, and concluded the Grenelle Agreement (May 27) that finally ended the strikes. Pompidou’s campaign calls for the restoration of law and order enabled him to lead the Gaullists to an unprecedented majority in the National Assembly elections of June 30, 1968. Although he was unexpectedly dismissed from the premiership by de Gaulle in July 1968, Pompidou retained his prestige and influence in the Gaullist party. When de Gaulle abruptly resigned the presidency in April 1969, Pompidou campaigned for the office and was elected on June 15, 1969, receiving more than 58 percent of the second-round votes."
