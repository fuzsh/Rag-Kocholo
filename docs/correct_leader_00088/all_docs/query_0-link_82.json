INSTEAD,HIS WORKIS CHARACTERIZEDBY A GENIUS FOR BALANCE AND CONTEXT“-PAUL GOLDBERGER,\n\n4.  I WANTED TO BE A MUSICIAN, BUT I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH SO I BECAME AN ARCHITECT...IT'S REALLY QUITE THERATICAL. MUSIC IS ABOUT ORDER AND MATHEMATICS. ORDER AND DISORDER, AS WELL AS, DISCIPLINE AND FREEDOM ARE PART OF THIS ARTISTIC STRUGGLE. ARCHITECTURE, LIKE MUSIC, DEPENDS A LOT ON DISCIPLINE AND ORDER, AND THEN YOU PLAY THAT ORDER,WHICH I INTERPRET AS SETTING UP FRAMEWORKS TO WORK WITHIN. BUT SOMETIMES, YOU MUST BECOME DISOBEDIENT TO THAT DISCIPLINE, AND YOU BREAK THE ORDER  \"IT IS MY BELIEF THAT EXCITING THINGS HAPPEN WHEN A VARIETY OF OVERLAPPING ACTIVITIES DESIGNED FOR ALL PEOPLE—THE OLD AND THE YOUNG, THE BLUE AND WHITE COLLAR, THE LOCAL INHABITANT AND THE VISITOR, DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS—MEET IN A FLEXIBLE ENVIRONMENT, OPENING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERACTION OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF INSTITUTIONAL LIMITS. WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE, DEPRIVED AREAS WELCOME DYNAMIC PLACES FOR THOSE WHO LIVE, WORK AND VISIT; PLACES WHERE ALL CAN PARTICIPATE, RATHER THAN LESS OR MORE BEAUTIFUL GHETTOS.\"\n\n5. \"Architecture is anartistic craft,butat thesametimeit is also ascientific profession, it isprecisely its distinctiveness\" \"Architecture is aservice.\" \"Whenstylegets tobecomeabrand,a personal seal,this becomes acage\" \"Thearchitect is first andforemost a builder, but alsoshould be apoet, and aboveall ahumanist'' IDEOLOGIES AND QUOTES\n\n6. His architecture is defined assolid constructionmadebyexcellent materials . CHARACTERIZED BY : Architecture is about exploring. Culturally, historically, psychologically, anthropologically, and topographically, everyjobis different. So the real risk is that as an architect you endup imposing your stamp before you understand what is the reality of a place. Itis not necessarily to integrate with the context. Sometimes architecture should not integrate, butshould make a contribution to the context.,\n\n7. RENZO PIANO: ECOLOGICALINNOVATOR Forthe great Italian architect RenzoPiano, the protectionof the environment,is far from being a limitation, it has also becomea \"source of inspiration\" for the development of major projects being undertaken in many countries.\n\n8.

ELEVATIONS:\n\n24. SECTIONAL ELEVATION - NORTH\n\n25. Architecture is more than just putting things together. It's about the organic, about illusions, a sense of memory, and a textural approach. I must admit, though, that I still love the idea of putting parts together. I love the idea that you go from the general to the detail and then from the detail to the general. It's a double process. You cannot think about the presence of the building in the city without thinking about materiality. And when you think about materiality, you start to think about detail\n\n32.
