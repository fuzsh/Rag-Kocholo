        "text": "Pompidou Centre, French national cultural centre on the Rue Beaubourg and on the fringes of the historic Marais section of Paris; a regional branch is located in Metz. It is named after the French president Georges Pompidou, under whose administration the museum was commissioned.\n\nThe Pompidou Centre was formally opened on January 31, 1977, by the French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Its overpowering industrial-looking exterior, which dwarfs its surroundings, attracted notoriety for its brightly coloured exterior pipes, ducts, and other exposed services. The architects were Renzo Piano of Italy and Richard Rogers of Britain. The Pompidou Centre quickly became a popular attraction and was reckoned to be one of the most frequently visited cultural monuments in the world.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nPrimarily a museum and centre for the visual arts of the 20th and 21st centuries, the Pompidou Centre houses many separate services and activities. Its museum of modern art brought under one roof several public collections of modern art previously housed in a number of other Paris galleries. There are also frequent temporary exhibitions devoted to modern themes. In addition there is a large public library, a centre for industrial design, a film museum, and the Centre for Musical and Acoustical Research founded by French conductor and composer Pierre Boulez. The music centre comprises rehearsal rooms, studios, and a concert hall and presents concerts devoted primarily to modern music."
