        "text": "The first branch of the Centre Pompidou is envisaged as a simple shelter, a sort of nomadic-like architecture and consists of an immense metallic veil stretched over the museum and partially open at its for corners. The tent creates an âin-betweenâ zone that piques the curiosity of passers-by, who then want to know what it conceals. The âhidden objectâ the visitor expects to find upon entering, slips behind a glass wall covered with an ultra-thin layer of silver. This two-way mirror reflects the image of what it covers, while still allowing one to perceive silhouettes circulating inside the edifice. At the center of the building, a huge nave houses monumental works of art. The exhibition galleries, organized in a sort of crown around the nave, are designed to maximize the number of itineraries. Finally, this âdematerializedâ construction is determinedly turned outward to the city as the plaza and the terrace, positioned between the roof and the metallic cover, which offers a panoramic view of the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nclient CommunautÃ© dâagglomÃ©ration de Metz mÃ©tropole (CA2M)\n\narchitect Dominique Perrault Architecte, Paris\n\nengineering Coyne et Bellier (structure), Jean Schmit (building services), Claude Ripeau (economist), Jean-Paul Lamoureux (lighting and acoustics)\n\nlocation Metz, France\n\nsite area 28 100 mÂ²\n\nbuilt area 15 390 mÂ²\n\nbuilt volume 150 000 mÂ³"
