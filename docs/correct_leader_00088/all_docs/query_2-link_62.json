        "text": "History of the Pompidou Centre in Paris\n\nThe Centre Pompidou was named after the initiative of the French President Georges Pompidou, however it is often known as the Beaubourg due to the area where it is located, and this is a large unusual building that houses a multi-cultural centre and a museum of modern art.\n\nEven though the history of the Pompidou Centre only started back in 1969 when the French President, Georges Pompidou, made the decision of having a multidisciplinary cultural centre developed within the Beaubourg area of Paris, it has become an important part of Parisian culture.\n\nThis project was to house a large library plus the Museum of Modern Art that was originally housed within the Palais de Tokyo.\n\nA major competition for ideas and designs was launched, and architects from all over the world were invited to participate and there ended up being 681 different competitors from 49 different countries.\n\nAfter much deliberation by a panel and chaired by the architect and engineer Jean Prouve, the project chosen involved three different architects, two of which were Italian by the names of Renzo Piano and Gianfranco Franchini and the third was an English architect called Richard Rogers.\n\nEven though there was a lot of controversy about the looks of the building during the 1970s when it was under construction, often being characterised as to the likes of an oil refinery by critics, yet today it meets with approval, winning the hearts of Parisians, and is now considered one of the emblematic buildings and a historical monument of the 20th century.\n\nOfficially inaugurated on 31st January 1977, the Centre Pompidou opened to the public on 2nd February that same year, becoming an instant success far exceeding any original expectations.\n\nIn fact, the Pompidou Centre quickly became one of the worlds most popular cultural venues and one of the most visited monuments in Paris and France with the late 1970s and 1980s seeing exhibitions that became legends in their own right.\n\nThe Next Stages of the Pompidou Centre\n\nOriginally formed back in 1947, the Musee Nationale dâArt Moderne, known as MNAM for short, as we quickly mentioned before, was re-located from the Palais de Tokyo to the Pompidou Centre where it grew considerably over the years and became a world leader in the field of modern and contemporary art.\n\nThe Pompidou also became home to IRCAM, which is the centre for research creation and music, plus of course it also had the largest free library in Paris.\n\nThen later on this cultural centre and the Pompidou organisation was reformed and a department of cultural development was formed that encompassed live performances, film and the spoken word, and over time the MNAM gradually became the second largest museum of modern and contemporary art in the world after the MOMA in New York."
