        "text": "Asset overview\n\nThe building is located c. 5km from central Paris at 49 Avenue Georges Pompidou, a strategic location just three minutes from the Metro, in the area of Levallois-Perret which is most sought-after by large occupiers seeking headquarters buildings close to the city but at much more competitive rents.\n\nDesigned as a headquarters building, “49 Pompidou” features 2,000 square metre floor plates, terraces on each level, panoramic views of the Seine and a triple-height lobby offering occupiers views towards a large interior garden, one of the few in the area.\n\nOur approach\n\nOur Real Estate team intend to undertake a renovation project to improve the building’s environmental credentials, enhance outdoor spaces and implement numerous services aimed at improving the quality of work life.\n\n“We are convinced of the attractiveness of labeled buildings, of medium size, with competitive rents for large users seeking quality of work life. Especially in the peripheral markets of the Paris Central Business District. We will be very creative in terms of services for this building to meet the users’ needs.”\n\nJean-Philippe Olgiati – Partner, Managing Director of Real Estate expertise"
