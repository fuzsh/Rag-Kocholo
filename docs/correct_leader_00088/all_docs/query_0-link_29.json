Additionally, museum officials are hoping that renovations can occur without closing the Centre.\n\nMuch of the building structure is of course located externally, so has suffered from continual exposure to the elements.\n\nSome external features, such as the large coloured funnels that were once part of the air system, are now just decorative.\n\nphoto : Michael Hierner\n\nExhibitions, shows and get-togethers will be presented in forty French cities, in partnership with a museum, a contemporary art centre, a theatre or a festival.\n\nRight up to early 2018, in forty cities from Grenoble to Lille by way of Le François in Martinique, Chambord and Nice, ranging from evening events to six-month exhibitions, proposals mingling exhibitions, concerts, theatre, dance and talks invite every type of audience to experience and share the originality of the Centre Pompidou.\n\nWebsite: Pompidou Centre Building Facelift – article in The Guardian\n\nWebsite: Centre Pompidou\n\n28 May 2012\n\nArchitecture Exhibition\n\nExhibition La Tendenza\n\n20 Jun – 10 Sep 2012, 11 am – 9 pm\n\nFirst retrospective in France dedicated to one of the later formation of the architecture of the postwar, from Italy, “The Tendenza, Italian Architecture, 1965-1985” presents a selection of over 250 drawings, models, photographs, paintings, films, and a very rich literature.\n\nphoto : Michael Hierner\n\nThe exhibition traces the highlights of the movement which Aldo Rossi was the leader. Rejecting the notion of avant-garde utopia and to initiate a political architecture and critical engagement with reality, the Tendenza is a new approach of the architectural project based on a revival of the drawing and image.\n\nColour-Coded External Services – vibrant MEP ductwork:\n\nphotograph © David Noble\n\n21 May 2010\n\nPompidou Centre Building\n\nNew building in Metz, France, by Shigeru Ban architect (Japan).\n\nPhotos by Rebecca Lomholt Breun of the intriguing homage to the new building in Metz, Northeast France:\n\nphotographs © Rebecca Breun\n\nCentre Pompidou-Metz, France – this unusual building opened in May 2010\n\nDesign: Shigeru Ban, architect, Japan\n\nphotograph : Roland Halbe\n\nCentre George Pompidou, Paris IVe\n\nDate built: 1976\n\nDesign: Rogers / Piano Architects\n\npicture © Adrian Welch\n\nCentre George Pompidou\n\nAddress: Rue Beaubourg, Paris IVe, France\n\nDate built: 1971-76(77)\n\nDesign: Richard Rogers / Renzo Piano Architects\n\npicture © Adrian Welch\n\nRadical building for its time with service ducts expressed on the exterior and all structure glamourised and articulated externally where possible. The architectural realisation of some Archigram ideas, with escalators providing dynamism to the main west facade. Half of the plot was given over to a rectilinear square which again added dynamism to the architecture. Also known as the Beaubourg Centre or simply The Pompidou building.\n\nRenovation of Centre Georges Pompidou took place in 1995 by Italian architecture firm Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW) (RPBW), led by architect Renzo Piano who worked on the original building with Richard Rogers.\n\nRichard Rogers Partnership\n\nOther Renzo Piano buildings can be found by following this link: Renzo Piano Architects\n\nEnjeu Capital(es) Exhibition, Oct 2009\n\nScanned photos of Beaubourg Centre by Isabelle Lomholt in 1989\n\nView from the building:\n\nThe famous escalator on the main facade facing the large public square:\n\nColoured ducts – early example of Hi-Tech Architecture:\n\nPool & Square at south side of the building:\n\nArchitects\n\nRichard Rogers Partnership are based in London, England, UK. This British design practice made their name from early Hi-Tech buildings, mostly in the UK. A major early work is the Lloyds of London headquarters building in the City of London, England.\n\nRenzo Piano Building Workshop are based in Genoa, Italy. The architecture practice opened a Paris studio in 1987.
