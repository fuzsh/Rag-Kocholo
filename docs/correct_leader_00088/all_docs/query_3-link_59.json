        "text": "Zoom out. What’s this place all about?\n\nWhen the Centre Pompidou opened in 1977, it was a radical (and controversial) design for a museum—all industrial pipes and open glass views of Paris. Forty-plus years later, it's the undisputed grande dame of Paris's contemporary art world. If you have never visited, it’s time to bump the museum to your priority list as it will close from summer 2025 until 2030 to undergo a massive, 260 million euro technical renovation. During the five-year closure, the institution’s collection will travel throughout France and internationally.\n\nYe shall know them by their permanent collection: How was it?\n\nThe collection is massive, with over 100,000 pieces ranging from 1905 to the present. You'll find everything from masterworks by Picasso to modern video installations.\n\nBut also by their new shoes. How were the exhibits?\n\nThe seasonal exhibits are generally of the highest quality; the 40th-anniversary lineup in 2017 included Magritte, Walker Evans, David Hockney, and Cy Twombly. The high ceilings and expansive salons let a typically crowded space feel open and airy.\n\nWhat did you make of the crowd?\n\nThe museum gets millions of visitors a year, and lines for major exhibitions can circle around the block. The permanent collections are usually quieter.\n\nOn the practical tip, how were facilities?\n\nThe elevators are easy to get to and come frequently. They also offer excellent views of the city as you near the top.\n\nGift shop: obligatory, inspiring—or skip it?\n\nThere are multiple gift shops scattered throughout the museum, as each special exhibition tends to have a dedicated one with products curated around its artist or theme. The main gift shop on the ground floor is worth a stop as well.\n\nIs the café worth a stop, or should we just plan on going elsewhere?\n\nLocated in the heart of the Marais, a restaurant at the Centre Pompidou would have to be pretty special to compete against all the excellent neighboring options. And Georges delivers—come for the smart, international menu and panoramic views over Paris (especially appealing at night, when the Eiffel Tower twinkles with light)."
