        "text": "In January 2003, the Pompidou Center and the City of Metz announced the decision, in agreement with the French Ministry for the Arts, Culture and Communications, to set up the first decentralized branch of the Centre National d’Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou in Metz. The architectural competition for the design of this new venue was launched in March, with the participation of Foreign Office Architects (FOA), Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, Herzog & de Meuron,?Stéphane Maupin and Pascal Cribier, NOX?Architekten and Dominique Perrault. Among all of them, the proposal finally selected was that of Ban and De Gastines.\n\nThe complex occupies a total surface area of 10,660 square meters, with 5,000 of them devoted to exhibition space. The roofing will be made up of hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat. It is ninety-meter-wide hexagon made of laminated wood beams placed at 2.9 meter intervals. To provide greater resistance and enable long spans of up to forty meters, its construction has been divided into two intertwined layers with different directions. This structure will be covered with a waterproof membrane made from fiberglass and teflon (PTFE or polytetrafluoroethylene), which protects the interior atmosphere of the building."
