        "text": "If the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay focus on classical art, the Pompidou Center is oriented towards modern and contemporary art. The museum houses pieces by Joan Miro, Brancusi, Matisse, Francis Bacon and other renowned painters and sculptors.\n\nIn case you are looking for what to see and do in Paris, you should include it in your route. The Pompidou Center is an amazing construction that adds a futuristic touch to the center of the capital.\n\nWhat types of tickets are available and are there skip the line tickets?\n\nYou can enter the Pompidou Museum in several ways. You will find the options below:\n\nEntrance to the museum + exhibitions: usually costs 14 ¤.\n\nEntranceto the museum + exhibitions in galleries 3 and 4: also in this case you will have to pay about 14 €.\n\nShows and concerts: these are special events and the ticket costs a little more. Normally, the price is around 18 € and there are special rates for children under 26 years of age\n\nCinema: to see movies and documentaries you will have to pay about 5 €.\n\nIn these cases you will spend less, but you will not have an expert guide at your disposal. In addition, if you book an organized tour you will not have to wait in line. Another plus point is the number of participants. Often there are no more than 5 people.\n\nAre tickets to the Pompidou Museum included in any tourist pass?\n\nOf course they are! If you want to visit it \"for free\", you will have to book the Paris Museum Pass (choosing between 2, 4 and 6 days) or the Paris Passlib, the official tourist card.\n\nFor more information, I recommend you to read the post that explains how it works, when it pays and what is included in the Paris Passlib card.\n\nAre there special tickets for children?\n\nGood news! Admission is free for visitors under 18 years of age. You will only have to pay if you want to take a workshop or a special visit. Note that the museum has plenty of activities for all ages, from babies to 16-year-olds.\n\nThe French capital is a perfect destination for traveling with the youngest members of the family. The most famous museums have guided tours designed for children and the main parks have incredible playgrounds. For more ideas, I recommend you to read the post that explains what to see and do in Paris with kids.\n\nWhy is it worth buying tickets online instead of at the box office?\n\nThe Pompidou is the second most visited museum in the city after the Louvre Museum. The queues in front of the ticket office are long and frequent; therefore, I recommend you to book your tickets in advance. This way you will not have to wait in the street in the heat or cold.\n\nIf you still prefer to buy your tickets on the spot, you will have to go to the Pompidou Center's ticket office located inside the museum. Please note that the last admission is one hour before closing time.\n\nWhat not to miss at the Centre Pompidou\n\nThe cultural institution at Place Georges Pompidou certainly does not go unnoticed. This unique building with exposed plumbing houses an unparalleled collection of modern and contemporary art. Below you find my personal selection of the best works:\n\n\"Fountain\" by Marcel Duchamp, the urinal that changed the way we think. It is an icon of the ready-made: an object of common use subtracted from its original purpose and elevated to a work of art.\n\n\"The Frame\" by Frida Kahlo, a self-portrait of the famous painter. In addition to her iconic face, it features two typical elements of Mexican art: flowers and colorful birds\n\n\"Made in Japan - La grande odalisque\" by Martial Raysse, the pop version of the painting \"La Grande Odalisque\" painted by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1815.\n\n\"Le jardin d'hiver\" by Jean Dubuffet, a white \"cave\" decorated with black lines and silhouettes. The atmosphere is very suggestive, ideal for taking some photos that are going to triumph on Instagram\n\n\"Les mariés de la Tour Eiffel\" by Marc Chagall, an oil painting that unites symbolism and cubism. It depicts a large white rooster with the painter and his wife on his back.\n\nHow much time do you need to visit the Pompidou Center?\n\nIt usually takes about 2 hours for a complete visit. However, if you are passionate about contemporary art you could spend up to 6 hours.\n\nIf you travel to Paris in summer, before entering or after leaving I recommend you to have a refreshing ice cream at Amorino, which is located in the same square of the museum.\n\nBest time to visit\n\nIn other museums, mornings are usually quieter compared to afternoons. At the Pompidou Center, it works the other way around. There are usually queues before the center opens, so it is preferable to visit in the afternoon (if possible, from 3:00 p.m.).\n\nThe French capital is a popular tourist destination and waiting times are frequent. However, in some months there are fewer tourists. In case you visit Paris in October or April, you will not find so many crowds in front of the museum.\n\nHow to get to the Pompidou Museum in Paris\n\nThe cultural institution is on Place Georges Pompidous, in the heart of the city. Its futuristic appearance creates a contrast with the classical buildings that surround it. It does not go unnoticed and will be easy to spot once you arrive at the stop. You have three options to get there:\n\nMetro, Châtelet stations (lines 1, 4, 7, 11 and 14), Hôtel de Ville (lines 1 and 11) and Rambuteau (line 1).\n\nBus, lines 29, 38, 47 and 75 stop a few meters away. You can also book one of the best tourist buses in Paris. Thanks to the hop-on/hop-off formula, you can get on and off wherever you want.\n\nRER, the suburban trains of the region. The nearest station is Châtelet Les Halles (lines A, B and D).\n\nWhere to eat near the Pompidou Museum\n\nSurrounding the cultural institution are several restaurants specializing in French recipes and foods from other parts of the world. The list below lists a few options within minutes of the Pompidou Center:\n\nGeorges, unbeatable views and signature cuisine. It is located on the same rooftop of the museum and also hosts some dj sets. Advance reservations are recommended.\n\nPain Vin Fromages, the ideal destination for cheese lovers. If you visit Paris in winter it is worth trying their fondues and raclettes accompanied by freshly baked bread (Rue Geoffroy-l'Angevin 3).\n\nQuick, a fast food chain specializing in burgers. It is a cheap option a few meters from the museum. Being French, it uses typical cheeses such as Brie and Camembert (Boulevard de Sébastopol 25).\n\nCrêperie Auguste, if you want to kill your appetite with a local specialty. You can also order crepes to take away and eat them at the nearby Place Igor Stravinsky (Rue Saint-Martin 88).\n\nOlive & Thym - Par Man'ouché, Lebanese cuisine with a modern twist. They are famous for their bowls with typical Middle Eastern products. Vegetarian options are also available (Rue Quincampoix 60).\n\nWhen you have more time you can take a gastronomic tour in Paris. These routes usually have stages in the Latin Quarter, Le Marais, Montmartre and other areas of the capital.\n\nTips for visiting the Pompidou Center in Paris\n\nIn this article I have detailed all the relevant information. To top it all off, here are a few more tips:\n\nTake your time to admire closely the Fontaine Stravinsky, the fountain dedicated to the Russian composer. It is the result of a joint work between the sculptor Jean Tinguely and the painter Niki de Saint Phalle. It is of Dadaist style and is located in the same Place Georges Pompidou.\n\nIn case you are traveling with a newborn, you will be pleased to know that there are baby changing tables on floors 0, 4, 5 and 6. I take this opportunity to recommend you to read the post on visits to Versailles with children\n\nThe museum is open every day except Tuesdays and May 1st. Take this into account when planning your vacation.\n\nThe Pompidou Center overhangs the old town and is one of the best viewpoints in Paris. There is a ticket that only allows you to go up to the roof without visiting the museum. The price is around 5 €.\n\nYou cannot enter with backpacks, helmets, umbrellas, baby carriers, camera flash devices and selfie sticks. However, you can leave them free of charge in the locker room.\n\nWhat to see and do near the Pompidou Center\n\nThe cultural institution is located just a few minutes walk from the Île de la Cité, the original core of the city. Before or after the museum you can visit the Notre-Dame Cathedral or enter the Sainte-Chapelle, a magnificent example of radiant Gothic."
