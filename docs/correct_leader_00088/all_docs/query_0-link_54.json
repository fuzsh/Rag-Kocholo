        "text": "A real architectural tour de force, the roof forms a hexagon 90 metres wide. With a surface area of 8,000 m2 and made entirely of glued laminated timber, the roof structure is composed of hexagonal modules, resembling the canework of a Chinese hat. This latticework makes it possible to span large expanses of around 40 metres, and to make the roof a self-supporting element, resting on just a few supports, the \"tulip poles\". The roof has a non-regular geometry, with curves and counter-curves. It is covered with a waterproof membrane made of fibreglass and Teflon (PTFE or Poly-Tetra-Fluoro-Ethylene), white in colour. The wood used for the frame (spruce) and for the tulip poles (larch) comes from Germany.\n\nOn the ground floor, the café opens onto a shaded terrace. The first floor provides access to the mediation areas and the restaurant. At the back of the Centre Pompidou-Metz is the support building, which contains its administrative and technical divisions.\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is surrounded by two gardens and a forecourt. The slightly sloping forecourt provides a direct pedestrian link between the Centre Pompidou-Metz and the railway station and has the same dimensions as the Piazza of the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It was designed by the Nicolas Michelin Associés agency and Paso Doble (landscape architect), who also created the northern garden of the Centre Pompidou-Metz. Planted with prunus trees, it covers 2 hectares in the form of grassy folds that collect rainwater from the roof and the forecourt.\n\nThe south garden is a private area designed by Nicolas Michelin Associés and landscape architect Pascal Cribier. In spring 2023, the metamorphosis of the garden will be entrusted to the famous landscape architect Gilles Clément, accompanied by Christophe Ponceau, one of his former students. A renowned gardener, botanist, biologist and landscape architect, he is an ardent defender of the notions of the \"planetary garden\", the \"garden in movement\" and the \"third landscape\".\n\nAt the Centre Pompidou-Metz, he opted for an abundance of greenery, a succession of atmospheres, a diversity of paths, and beds of Jaumont stone, known as \"Metz sunstone\", which is unique to the region. The garden invites you to relax and daydream. Majestic birches, grasses, cotoneasters and other creeping plants will flourish and spread out in all the spaces.\n\nA veritable haven of nature in an urban environment, the garden will undergo a natural transformation over the coming years. \"Designed with vegetation that encourages the emergence of a rich and varied spontaneous biodiversity, it is proof that a landscape is never static when it trusts nature,\" says Gilles Clément. As a result, this germinating garden will be transformed, allowing nature to flourish and the landscape to change.\n\n*Wooden furniture donated by Maison Tectona\n\nMajestic tree donated by Décor Harmonie Réalisation\n\nLandscaping created with the support of Caisse des Dépôts"
