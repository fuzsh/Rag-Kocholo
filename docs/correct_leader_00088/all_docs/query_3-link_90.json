        "text": "Posted on April 25, 2007 by VINGT Editorial\n\nText: Ana Lee\n\nIn the heart of the Marais, you’ll find one of Paris’s most famous museums – known to locals as Beaubourg although its official name is the Centre national d’art et de culture Georges Pompidou, it’s a junction for the visual arts, theatre, music, and film.\n\nThe building in itself is a monument not to be missed; it can easily be spotted from a distance, as you’ll find multicoloured pipes enwrapping its faucets, once causing a scandal when it first opened in 1977.\n\nThe complex was designed by British architects, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers along with Irish engineer Peter Rice, and was intended to reflect the spirit of the 20th century, proposing constraint-free architecture.\n\nThe center accommodates an ongoing modern and contemporary art museum, temporary expos, cinema, and performance art. The museum includes works by Kandinsky, Klein, Gorky … among many others.\n\nIn the back of the building (rue Beaubourg), you’ll find access to its Public Reference Library, providing free internet and access to public media.\n\nOn the top floor you’ll find a bar and restaurant “Georges” along with free access to the roof, where you’ll see the most breathtaking panoramic cityscape of Paris, notably with a view of both the Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower. The center is open everyday except Tuesdays, from 12 pm to 10 pm."
