        "text": "Our mission\n\nThe Pompidou Group upholds the core values of the Council of Europe – human rights, democracy and the rule of law – and seeks to balance the interests of the community at large with protection of the individual’s fundamental rights in responding to drug use and illicit trafficking in drugs.\n\nOur approach\n\nOnly through a balanced, multifaceted approach can the potential benefits of different strands of drug policy be fully realised. Drug policy has to be innovative and evidence based. It needs to include research, prevention, harm reduction, treatment and law enforcement. Operating on these principles, the Pompidou Group provides knowledge, support and guidance for effective and humane drug policies by linking policy, practice and research.\n\nOur members\n\nThe Group currently consists of 41 member states, and co-operates with countries all over the world. The Pompidou Group is an Enlarged Partial Agreement that is also open to non-Council of Europe states, including states outside Europe.\n\nOur achievements\n\n50 years of successful co-operation on drug policies and human rights - the Pompidou Group provides tools that enable decision makers to implement effective measures to reduce drug trafficking, better treat substance use disorders and address the associated negative impacts in society.\n\nOur history\n\nThe brainchild of the late former French President Georges Pompidou, the Pompidou Group was formed in 1971 in an effort to better understand and tackle the growing drug problems in Europe. In 1980 the Group was incorporated into the institutional framework of the Council of Europe as an inter-governmental body."
