        "text": "The Centre Pompidou was inaugurated on 31 January 1977. From the moment it opened to the public on 2 February 1977, it met with immense success, rapidly becoming one of the most popular cultural venues in the world and one of the most visited monuments in France.\n\nA reorganisation in 1992 saw the creation of a department of cultural development, responsible for a programme of live performance, film screenings, lectures, symposia and debates. The fusion of the modern art museum and the centre for industrial design laid the foundations for an architecture and design collection that in twenty years has become one of the most impressive in the world.\n\nAfter twenty years of activity and having welcomed over 150 million visitors, under president Jean-Jacques Aillagon the Centre Pompidou underwent renovation work that lasted from October 1997 to December 1999. The government provided funding to expand gallery space for the display of the permanent collection and improve facilities for live performance. The whole project saw the renewal and reorganisation of 100 000 m2 of floor space.\n\nThe Centre Pompidou reopened on 1 January 2000, again meeting with great success, being visited by 16 000 people a day that year. At present, the Centre Pompidou welcomes some 3.5 to 3.8 million visitors per annum, depending on the year.\n\nSource: centrepompidou.fr"
